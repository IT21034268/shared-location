1,"GLEE Season 2, Volume 1","Returned when saw that the entire season was already up on the availability list and volume 2 was not. Got a full refund, no restocking or s/h fees. That was the most impressive thing of all. In fact, will keep me as an avid Amazon shopper."
1,"Still burned by ""Season 1, Volume 2"" price gouge","Up front, know that I love this show, but the fragile joy, innocence and vulnerability highlighted on the show is ruined by the marketing tactics that have resulted since its success. It manages to dampen my enthusiasm for the show itself, and that sucks. Can you imagine, for example, if ""Season 1, Volume 2"" had been offered at a fair price to the thousands of folks who bought ""Season 1, Volume 1?"" Good energy between creators and fans creates more loyalty and success in the long run. Instead you find yourself paying nearly twice as much as those who just waited for ""The Complete Season."" Penalizing those who buy ""Part One"" of each season and making them feel like Losers when the complete season is released at roughly the same price as Volume 1 sucks. It will bite you in the butt down the road, and you'll wish you'd treated fans with more respect."
3,Wait until the full season comes out!,"I love this show! No doubt about it. If I had all the money in the world, I would buy this right now. But after buying season 1 volume 1, then waiting and getting volume 2, I realized just how much money I was spending. I could have saved a lot if I just waited to get the full season. So you should too! You'll be saving money that could go towards something else. Just wait until the the complete season 2 comes out"
1,"GLUM on GLEE, You Live...You Learn","No thanks FOX, I'll wait. At this price we can expect to pay fifty plus dollars for both volumes, you do the math."
5,Gotta love glee!,Glee is our guilty pleasure and we were able to purchase on Amazon for a great price and it arrived very quickly.
2,Poor Digital Quality On One Of The Disks,The show - Excellent. The quality of manufacturing on the disks - Poor. Disk 2 catches and stalls on a number of episodes. I thought it might be my DVD Player so I put it in the computer...same problem. I think there was a problem when they were encoding the disks (BTW these were fresh out of the wraper - no scratches).
1,Half A Season at Full Price? What a Slushee to the Face!,"I am writing this one star review in protest of 20th Century Fox profiting from eager fans by selling half a season at full price. Trust me, you'll feel like a fool later when the complete season is available for purchase. If sales are low for this half season set, I am willing to bet the company will delay releasing a complete season set later...if at all. They are giving us both slushee in the face and the finger. What a way to reward fans and suppoerters of the show!"
1,Inappropriate and cartoonish.,"This music does not accompany the Keaton films; it competes with it.While it may be okay jazz, it is very poor film music."
4,It gets the job done.,Its not really the best capo by any means but for the price it works wonderfully. The only issue i have with this is that it has to be strapped around the neck instead of squeezing a handle and putting it where it needs to go. Excellent for playing around at home but not too good for doing shows.
2,Wasn't very impressed,"Let me start by saying, this band is not very original or ""progressive"" at all. Almost all the songs have very basic verse/chorus/bridge formats which make everything predictable. However, there are some catchy melodies here and there. If you're into Mind's Eye, you'll love this band. If you're looking for another Dream Theater or Symphony X, look elsewhere."
2,This book should not have been in the Christian book section,I bought this book only after reading the insert. I usually purchase books from the Christian section of the library. This one definately was out of place there. I returned it after reading the prologue.
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,"I thought this book was thoroughly enjoyable. Being a born and bred Yankee, the Southern charm was apparent as the other reviewers noted, however I believed the themes of family, maternal love, inter-generational relationships were globally appealing. Many women everywhere are in a situation like Ruth Ann struggling with priorities and problems of aging parents and rebellious children and personal dilemmas. The positive message that comes from this book (mostly through Marvelle's wisdom) remind us of the long term perspective that we often can't see through the day-to-day crisises of carpools, report cards, layoffs, illness we face each day."
3,"A Cute ""Chick"" Novel","This was a cute read though slightly boring. It is written around the lives of four women in a southern family, spanning several generations -- from the eccentric matriarch (who is simply comical), to the control freak mother and her dreamer of a sister, down to the troublesome, pregnant 19-year old daughter. There is nothing really page turning about this book, and there doesn't appear to be a well thought out plot, but it was cute nonetheless.Warning: The grammar will make you cringe, but somehow makes the narration more believable."
2,Not for grammar mavens.,"I'm afraid I didn't finish this novel because it was very gratingly written in dialect. The whole thing, without pause. Even descriptions, even people's thoughts. If cutesy dialect-writing gets on your nerves, don't order this.I couldn't bear the precious writing style long enough to finish it. Somehow, as a bluecollar Southerner, I felt condescended to with all those ""she done""s. You know, even the crackeriest cracker isn't quite that bad, particularly people the age of the mother & daughter characters, who have actually attended high school (I could understand it more for the grandmother character, but ALL THREE CHARACTERS HAVE THE SAME VOICE with the SAME grammar quirks). I worked in a food stamp office in South Carolina for nine years and I never met anyone quite that unintelligible. We're not that quaint, honey; sometimes our verbs even agree. Honestly! Give this a miss unless you enjoyed Uncle Remus."
3,MOON WOMEN Has Its Moments,"Pamela Duncan's book has enjoyable moments, to be sure. Most of the voices are engaging and likable, but overall the novel is lightweight. Lightweight is probably what most people want to read these days (look at Terry McMillan's popularity and the Ya-Ya Sisterhood), but if you are interested in a novel with real weight and power, this is probably not it. Duncan has the talent to write more substantive books, and here's hoping she does."
3,Good read,"Although this book was not a page-turner, it was entertaining and enjoyable. At times, it moved rather slowly but I felt that I really knew the characters by the end as they were well developed and believable. I especially liked Marvelle and enjoyed the way she interacted with her pregnant granddaughter and the rest of the family. A good book for a light-hearted read."
4,Wonderful starter book on Kentucky,"Getting ready for a trip to Kentucky, this book written towards young people but is an excellent starter book. It is listed at 7.96 and I think its a steal. It is 80 pages including index, full of information and color photos, well worth a read and cheap enough to add to your library."
5,FOR TYA FANS ITS UNREAL!!,"AS GOOD A ALBUM AS ANY BEFORE.WHY HASN'T THIS CD GOTTEN MORENOTICE?WORKING AT A PARKING LOT,IS THE BEST ROCKER EVER BYTHEM.GRANTED I'M 55 AND SENILE,IT IS WORTH BUYING THE LPJUST FOR THIS CUT.PLAY IT AT EAR DAMAGE LEVEL."
5,Holy Smoke,"This was the album that turned me on to Rahsaan Roland Kirk. I'm forever grateful. I lost this cd in a breakup once, it took me years to find it again. RIP to both Kirk and Joel Dorn (he collected and released this). Bright moments, indeed, many thanks to each of them."
2,I hate to say this about a fine performance...,"This is a lovely disc, but the musicians are being let down by problems with the DVD authoring/mastering. As a stereo downmix, the levels are too low, which compromises the ability to play it back without getting too high a noise floor. Further, the package says it was recorded and mixed in 24/48 resolution. Why then is the DVD Audio MLP presented at 24/44.1? The explanation could be that it is a simple typo, but perhaps Naxos is not using the original high resolution audio here. Maybe it was sample-rate converted. There's no way to tell.It's sad to see these problems. They are inexcusable."
2,Great product if the picture was correct,The photo shows a over the door hook. The actual hooks are great but now what i wanted
5,Super strong!,Great magnet! I needed something strong to hang a large calendar on the fridge and this did the trick! Looks great too...not too big.
4,Good for kitchen use,"This is a good item from which to hang small pots and pans (I use it on the side of my refrigerator), but the only concern is that if you drag it around it will mark the surface."
3,The Hinges are weak points.,"The computer is good overall. Nice fast processor. If you want something to replace your desktop computer this is it. The notebook is large and heavy and the right LCD hinge broke on me. I bought some used ones on EBAY to fix it. But the hinge broke off the inside frame under the LCD screen so I had to ""jerry rig"" it back together. I love Toshiba notebooks and have bought a couple more. Usually they hold up very well."
2,Meh,"It had some humor, but it's quite dull and very abstract. I guess it's more of a time-piece. But we can always work on his aim."
4,An oldie but a goodie,"It was fun to re-read this book after so many years. Amazingly, it's contents are as timely and fresh as when first written. If you're a teacher, read it. If you've ever been a student, read it. You'll find yourself laughing out loud, with an occasional lump in your throat. So glad I bought it!"
3,English teachers?,"I selected this book because my niece is an English teacher. She has told me similar stories of extreme paperwork, regulation, bureaucracy, inefficiency, duplication etc but continues onward with her love of teaching and impacting children's lives. I respect her and all teachers, who like Bel Kaufman, devote their careers to TEACHING our children."
4,Underrated mc,One of the best mc's coming out of The First Priority clan.(after Lyte). A steal or better yet a robbery for the price wanted.
5,Good quality head bolts,"Nothing too exciting here just some head bolts. They are of very good quality and do what they should. The only problem I had is that you get only 10 bolts. I needed 14 of them, so instead of buying 20 bolts I reused 4 of the old bolts."
1,Gets progressively worse with use,"I have owned two of these units. I got them for free for signing up for a credit card. Therefore, I was surprised to see the model retailed as a midrange player instead of at the low end. Both units worked flawlessly at first. However, despite the retail price, they both eventually started skipping/rattling, which only got worse over time, and eventually they refused to play altogether.Of course it is possible that these two were not representative of the population of all JD-VD135s ever produced, but nevertheless I'm now hesitant to purchase another JWIN. At least I didn't have to pay for these two."
1,Ruined Kitchen Cabinets,"I owned this product for 4 years. After the third cracked housing (the crack was in the threads of the outlet filter housing; water pressure was not a factor, we decreased the water flow to the filter) and kitchen flooding, I emailed the company. All I received was a sarcastic reply ""sorry you had soo many problems."" Now I have to replace or try to refinish my custom-made cabinets. Currently I'm looking for a new filter system. I'm also going to install a flood alarm/auto cut-off system to the undercounter water filter."
2,Undercounter Filtration System,"I have owned mine for about a year without any problems, but now that my wife is pregnant I'm more concerned about the ability of this product to filter out what they claim. Until she delivers I'm sticking with bottled water. I need proof, real test results of this unit."
2,Improves water taste very little,"I don't know about leaking problems. I installed (under counter) myselfand had no trouble. Connections are very simple (too simple?) you just push hoses into recepticals. You cannot connect to your ice maker for filtered water to refrig. Our water out here in the country has a mineral taste, somewhat salty. We had a RO system that just broke down (4 years old it took all mineral taste out of water. I am trying this system to retain some minerals in the water, however it does not improve the taste of our water much. Maybe 40% better. So just know that compared to RO your water will taste much more like straight tap water."
2,Not impressed after 2 years of use,"I did some research before chosing this unit - although it is hard to find reputable and unbiased info on the web the Aquasana system seemed to have a good reputation. I would agree with other reviewers that the system seems flimsy; although I haven't had any parts break, I had trouble getting replacement cartridges to fit without leaking. I also have had problems with the dispenser dribbling and running on for a while after use.My biggest issue is perhaps not the fault of the unit, but the water tastes weird if it sits around in a glass for a couple of hours after being dispensed. Not sure if this is due to my water supply or to the water filter."
1,Housing cracks,"Housing cracked - twice - second time flooded my kitchen. Great water, while it lasted. I'm sure the water that ruined my floor was great, too."
1,TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT.,"We installed it and it immediately spewed water from the filter casing onto the floor. we tightened it as much as we could, and still - water. This seems like a super flimsy, poorly designed product. I was surprised at how light the filters were - I thought it used a charcoal filtration system - clearly , I did not do my homework.In their favor, they said they'd refund my c.c. the full amount as soon as it was recieved. we shall see...."
1,big design flaw,"This water filter has a bad design and they know it, they were told along all these years, and the bad reviews are piling up.Their solution : offering you a program called Water For Life, so they give you the same bad design product 20% off !!!!!!!!!!!!!So, you can actually have 20% discount for this 'thing'... I don't want it even for free....Have tried hard to use it for 4 years, and now I want something more reliable and better made.Can anyone suggest me a good one ?"
2,Keeps leaking,Have had the under counter filter for three years. Have changed leaking screw downs five times. Each time it cost me money for a new screw cap ... about $15 with shipping. Each time they say they have corrected the problem(the threads fail because it is a cheap plastic molded part)Stay away from this product unless you like playing with plumbing under the sink.
1,New AQ-4600 upgrade LEAKS!!,"I recently upgraded (free) to the Aqua-4600 big knob under sink model. I was very happy with my old unit, but thought the upgrade would make replacing filters a tad easier. The new units GUSHES water through the seam of unit housing. I called the tech support, which really didn't offer much support. They sent me another unit and that one LEAKS too! I now have gone back to the original unit and all is good again. Note: I have been a customer for three years and I have found the Aquasana products and the customer service department to be great. I would say, their tech support could use some fluffing up. And of course, the AQ-4600 needs to be back to the drawing boards!"
4,WORKS GREAT,"I bought this system after trying another brand of counter top system that later on i realised didnt really filter out anything from the water and was just a big gimmick .I did a little research and decided to order the aquasana because of their reviews and performance ratings , the system came in the mail a few days later, its gona take a little mechanical ability and some tools to install this sysytem while not hard it definately requires u to be at least a little flexible to get up under the cabinet to install the system , installation took about half an hour, first install and it leaked from the plastic housing where the caps screw in ,, i guess its a common thing, the rubber o ring has to be in place perfectly or else it will leak, after a few trys i finally got it right and so far it has not leaked i have had it for a year now and 2 filter changes and everything is great. I would say i am satisfied with the system and their customer support."
5,an enchanting show,"Having had the good fortune to see this with dazzling pianist Kevin Cole (featured here) at the keyboard, this recording is extra-special. Buy this if for nothing else than Upshaw's exquisite ""Someone To Watch Over Me"" that showcases the song, not the singer, but you'll listen to every song with pleasure. This is Ira at his best: ""It's never too late to Mendelssohn, Two hearts are at journey's endelssohn..."" George, of course, is in prime form. The rest of the cast sings,, and acts, as well as Upshaw, for there's a goodly amount of dialogue here. This is, hands down, my favorite of the Roxbury recordings."
3,"Oh, Kay is JUST O. K., With Me.","This reconstruction of Oh, Kay! is a neat and workmanlike job. Miss Upshaw is in fine form, and the supporting cast is good, but the show perhaps looses some of its considerable period charm through the distinctly modern vocal and orchestral performances. One only needs to compare the performances on this disc to those waxed eighty years ago by Miss Lawrence, and a number of other period recordings, notably the Victor ""Gems from OH, KAY!"" to see the effects of overly slow tempi (for example, Do, Do, Do) and an utter lack of understanding of the type of syncopated music written by the Gershwins (Clap Yo' Hands was intended to be an uptempo production number, not a Minsterel Shout). Perhaps performance practice has changed so very much that an accurate reconstruction can no longer be attempted."
2,So-so Gershwin musical,"Although this was a hit when first produced on Broadway with superstar Gertrude Lawrence, it is difficult today to see what made this musical so appealing. The Gerhswins did the score but there are only a few standouts. The rest of the numbers sound like they were made on the assembly line of George and Ira Gerhswin. They are not memorable. On top of that, they have not aged well. ""Clap yo' Hands"" sounds like it was lifted from a minstrel show. ""Do, do, do"" is just dumb, dumb, dumb. Of course, ""Someone to watch over me"" will live forever but it is only given an adequate reading here. I still consider the ""Girl Crazy"" restored version in this series as excellent and well worth your money. You can probably do without the rest with the exception of ""Lady, be good"", and even that has a good deal of filler."
5,Lifegiving truly is a beautiful way of life!,"Lifegiving by Tammy Malby offers an amazing look into how women can live a full and beautiful life. In a culture that has taught us to perform, perform, perform in order to achieve success, Tammy goes against the popular tide to return women back to their most basic instinct - lifegiving. She shares the secrets of how to use that instinct to nurture the lives around us, to live boldly beautiful lives, and to bring beauty to the world around us. I highly recommend this book to all women who are tired of living a mundane life. This is an amazing read! You will want to share it with all your friends."
4,Very inspirational,"This book was full of wonderful, true stories of women who have found their ministries. Their lives and ministries are very inspiring and uplifting. It makes me want to do more for others and in service to the Lord. Also, very easy to read and enjoy."
3,Maybe for 4 year old,"I picked it up for my 3 year old, though he likes the book, but it has a lot of activities which need a little older kid. Maybe a 4 year old."
3,"Works, not for a dog that bites","I think this went on fine, but is not a solution for a dog that bites people, unfortunately. A dog could get it off, and could bite in the process."
4,Loaded with features but doesn't work well in low light,My daughter loves all the feature and ease of use. She uses if for her HS chemistry class. The only negative is that you need good lighting for the calculator to work well. Not good if you are working in an area without direct lighting.
2,the worst design,"there is one major flaw in this calculator that I will give it a 2 stars no matter how good or power it is on the other aspects. and that is: all of the 3rd function text on the calculator is purple, which is extremely hard to read on the black case. I am a programmer that use primarily the HEX calculation on it, and every time I use it I have to gaze so hard to find the A-E. Can Texas Instruments not be so dumb? Purple text? what a laugh!"
2,You can get much more for this money,"TI36X costs $18 in Wallmart, $22 in Walgreens. For this monies (or less) you can get much more if you buy Sharp 506V or Casio fx-115MS. Here is what these calulators have but TI36X doesn't: true algebraic logic with 2 line display, editing and memory of operations, 6 memories, complex numbers, several types of regression, nonlinear equation solver (Casio only), integrals and differentials, polynomial solver (Casio only), linear equation solver, formula memory (Sharp has 2 permanent memories, Casio 1 volatile), repetitive calculations. Both calculators have the same basic functionality as TI36X"
1,I'm a math professor this calculator is no good,"I'm not sure why this has such great ratings, but there are much better calculators for the price. As a Math professor at a college do not buy this calculator. There reasons are listed below.1. there are much better calcs for cheaper like the TI -30,2. It doesn't show you your work as you go. This is old stuff and now a days calculator can view what you are plugging in as you go. This is the main reason you con't want to buy this calc3. It's strictly solar so there is not battery backup and it will lose power in low lighting"
3,"Fairly good, though slow","This calculator is very good for temporary usage, but don't expect to use it for very long. After I bought it, I had it for about three weeks before the display started to fade. The calculator ceased funtioning soon after. Also, this calculator is slower than most that I have seen. It takes it over five seconds to calculate (68!). The TI-25 is a smaller model and it calculates the result faster. So, if you want a good middle-school calculator, this is the way to go. However, if you want one that will last you a lifetime, I recommend a higher model or an HP."
2,solar power alone doesn't cut it,"Bought this calc because usually TI makes a good product. Had to return it because the solar power just doesn't cut it - unless you are in a VERY well-lit room, forget it... my chemistry class has decent lighting, and it still barely works there... save some frustration and get a dual power - you don't want to be taking a test and have this thing fade out on you. Still like TI calculators all around, just avoid this one."
4,Make sure you are ordering the correct version!,"I ordered this CD three times, from three seperate dealers and always ended up getting the 1991 Charisma records release, without the extra tracks. Make sure the seller you're buying from has listed the correct CD! You may want to ASK the seller before ordering if it is indeed the 2002 re-release with four extra tracks (16 total).Great comeback album for the Knack! Not ""classic"" Knack, but certainly an interesting direction!JM"
3,The best the Knack has ever been...,"Aside from ""Get the Knack"" (after which came their second and most dismal release), ""Serious Fun"" is a straight-forward guitar-driven rock-and-roll album. ""Rocket O' Love"" and ""I Want Love,"" with their catchy vocals and excellent guitar work, are well worth the price of the album. The rest is mostly average work, (with some notable exceptions, such as ""The River of Sighs"") with the same glossy melodies.It is a far cry from their first album, but that's not necesarrily (sp:?) bad. Altogether, the sound is more hardcore-rock, and the production is very polished. The vocals are dead-on, and put together very well. In the same vein, the songwriting is also far superior to their two previous albums (and way better then that of the preceeding album, which was lackluster at best).So, to sum it all up, the songs either smoke, or they're so-so. You'll probably find three or four on there that you'll like, and the rest can be pitched."
4,Darda cars are fun,"These little cars are fun for the kids. I wish they would last a little longer on each cycle. Still, they are fun and easy to operate."
2,NOTHING TO DO WITH CHRISTIMAS,"I bought this movie based on the review and I love Christmas movies. So I thought that it would have someChristmas spirit or theme to the movie,IT DID NOT. NOTHING ABOUT CHRISTIMAS, BUT THE WORSE WRITTEN MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.THIS WOMAN WHO WROTE THIS MOVIE, NEEDS TO GIVE IT UP. SHE IS NOT A WRITER OR DIRECTOR OR PRODUCER.GET A NEW JOB.THIS WAS THE WORSE MESS I HAVE EVER SEEN. FROM PLOT 2 PLOT, AND SOME OF IT I COULD NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND THESUPPOSED 'ENGLISH'.I WAS FURIOUS.PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I'M MAD I DID,"
2,Light Listening,"I was disappointed in this CD, looking for something more hardcore. Too much unison. After all, with a cover of ""Volaré"" how intense is it gonna get?Not to totally trash this CD. The singing is strong and a wall of sound from the acoustic guitars. Just not what I wanted."
1,Ghastly,"It is well known that every questionable restaurant in the English speaking world has a copy of this record. Indeed, certain commentators are known to judge the repute of a given restaurant on this single fact.For nothing, but nothing, is guaranteed to expel straggling punters into the chill night air than a blast of these hoarse mediterraneans shouting their way through a foreign language version of ""My Way"". And if that doesn't do the trick, Bamboleo surely will.It rids the kitchen of vermine and wards off vampires, too.Olly Buxton"
4,Gipsy Kings,"In general the product is fine, including packaging. However I feel that the sound is not very good."
2,Too much singing,"I took a chance on the Gypsy Kings, thinking that with all the rave reviews this album might be right up my alley. There are a few tracks that I enjoy but personally, I find there is too much singing. I just enjoy listening to the instruments. Oh well. You never know until you try."
3,AVERAGE FOR COMMERCIAL REGERGITATION,NOT AS TIGHT AS CURANDERO OR AS INVENTIVE. BUT IT IS A GREAT SUBSTITUTE FOR A RECLUSIVE MASTER HIDING IN THE MOUNTAINS OF COLORADO.
4,Why is this not under pop?,This record consists of rumbas ! It's POP NOT FLAMENCO !! To see that there is not one single record with real flamenco from start to finish among the 20 first records listed under 'Flamenco' just shows what a minute understanding there is about this music here! Paco was playing fusion when he played with Al di Meola and Andres Segovia is a classical guitarist who never played flamenco.Its not a question of being a purist - the discussion in spain between traditional and new flamenco consists of issues like 'is it ok to use a saxophone in bulerías ?' or 'is modern singers sounding to much like camarón?'Now if you dont know who camarón was or what bulerías is then you dont know anything at all about flamenco!
4,"Good, but See Newer Best of...","The only reason I give this 4 stars at all is due to the fact that very recently gypsy kings has a double disc best of which is more comprehensive and has some real gems missing on this disc. All the songs here are bona fide favorites and quite exceptional, but the two disc has favs like habla me and hotel california which make it quite worth the upgrade. Get this one if you must, but the double disc is much better."
3,Average Resource,"I am a seminary student at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. This book was required reading for a theology class.I found it to be an average resource with limited original perspective and very little application. It was a decent review of the theology of the church, full of Bible references and following the Reformed perspective typical of this particular series.It did not engage the issues of women in ministry or the contemporary application of spiritual gifts to my satisfaction.I would only buy this book again if I needed a reference for Reformed theology on this topic. Most of the concepts and references in this resource can be found elsewhere to greater depth and with more engagement of alternative perspectives.Jonathan"
1,disappointed,"overall awful, could not finish watching. Actors were very handsome, but could not watch actress. Very slow and not entertaining."
1,AT THE RISK OF BEING REDUNDANT,"It was highly validating to see all the bad reviews this movie got. I just wish I'd read them before I'd clicked the purchase button. It was as though they were working hard to make it as bad as possible -- especially the acting. What's Bradley Cooper doing in this? He doesn't need the money. What would I have liked to know before renting it? That it SUCKED!!! Amazon, please issue me a credit voucher immediately forthwith. You can refund my money even if you did steal my time."
1,Horrible,"Ridiculous movie. Plot was unbelievable. Low budget and poor quality. Acting was bad. Obviouslythey are trying to repromote this movie due to Bradley Cooper's new fame. However, this is one youshouldn't waste your time on."
1,awful,"i like indie. i like underpolished. i make underpolished. but the genre doesn't match the lack of polish. can't do a chick flick rom com with pretty actors and then expect us to accept everything else that is terribly done; the editing, the sound, the writing, the make-up, the sets, the acting. what's left?"
1,"Bad, bad movie",The movie is unbelievably bad and should not be offered for sale or rent. Burn all the copies in the world!
1,Blatant Rip off by Amazon,This is a blatant rip off by Amazon playing on the current popularity of Bradley Cooper and hoping that no one will research past the 2 minute preview u get online to find out about the movie. I later found out that the movie is an indie film that was done in 2002. The worst part was they charged a HD quality price of $4.99 for a grainy low budget film. The lead character is a young woman who grew up in a carnival where it's the norm to create an illusion and rip the suckers off - and that's exactly what I feel happened here!
1,TERRIBLE!,"This movie was shockingly bad... I couldn't believe the poor quality of the film editing. The script was bad, the editing was bad, it was BAD!"
1,Horrid Movie,"WOW! This was a horrid horrid movie. The acting was just terrible, combine that with bad writing and it was unwatchable!"
4,liked it alot,"So easy to tell that Bradley Cooper was going to be a star from this early performance. It's an Indie film so lacks the polish of the big films, and some of the acting was only so-so, but enjoyed the story very much. If you are looking for something different, you will not be disappointed."
5,Mel,"Pleasantly surprised! Just caught this Bradley Cooper Indie on V.O.D. and was impressed. Smart dialogue and nuanced, well rounded characters. If you are looking for Hollywood sheen and polish, you won't find it here. Lots of laughs blended with poignancy and cool Carny flashbacks. Like most smaller films, it is not without its flaw. But it definitely wins you over with Smart's and Cooper's ineffable charm"
1,Abysmal,"If it was possible to give this movie zero stars I would. There is no humor, no plot, and no acting. The players in the movie appear to be reading their lines out loud from prompts. The lighting is very weird and the sound quality is terrible. I wish I had not wasted the ninety or so precious minutes on my life on this movie. I kept watching hoping that some kind of plot would unfold, and then all of a sudden (thankfully) it was over. Save your money and your time."
1,bending all the rules,"The worst movie I've ever seen. I barely made it through the introductory song, etc...and turned it off within minutes once the story got going. What a disappointment."
1,Wowzerrrss,"This movie was torture. It was like watching a bad 70s porn, minus the porn. After 16 minutes, I couldn't believe I actually paid to rent this movie. Don't waste your time. Bad acting, bad script, just bad."
1,Horrid.,"I can't even believe Bradley Cooper would allow this to be released. Worst movie in ages, and i just had to stop it. Unwatchable. I rented it from a kiosk and wanted to shake the machine to refund the dollar i wasted....even though it was on my debit card.Terrible movie."
1,Should have known better to rent this,"It took me 6 hours to download this movie and I only watched about six minutes of the whole movie. While I was downloading it, I went to IMDB and saw the horrible ratings and have to agree. Why was Bradly Cooper involved with this movie, he's so much better than this?"
1,Awful,"Hollow sounding, terrible dialog, horrible production values,supporting actors with no talent, terrible direction, amateurish pace, awful music, such a mistake."
1,such a disappointment,even though i saw all the reviews saying how bad it was i just had to see for myself. it was very unprofessional and just strange... you can't hear anything and it's so hard to follow. don't waste your money to watch it.
1,It's way below one star,"I am easily entertained, but this is the first movie in years that I didn't finish watching. Wish I had clicked it off when I first thought about it. As everyone else is saying it is just plain bad...bad...bad! Don't even rent it for a dollar. Don't even watch it for free. I couldn't belive how stilted and awful the acting was."
4,good,it is exactly how it is described a good cookbook that has pretty much everything there is in it. great
4,Good Product,"I enjoy these bars, they make a nice snack. They taste great and are not as high in calories/fat/carbohydrates as a candy bar. You can feel good about snacking on these instead, and the kids like them too. I keep one in my purse just in case I need to eat and the only thing available is a vending machine. These also stay with you longer for some reason."
3,Slightly healthier than a candy bar,"While this product contains ""a mix of three different kinds of nuts and seeds, almonds, and rolled oats"" it it hardly a healthy product, containing, as it does, five different kinds of sweeteners. As others have observed, the bars are sticky, so not for someone with fragile dental work. At 140 calories, they constitute a nice snack, probably slightly better for you than a candy bar. Actual ""trail mix"", with the nuts, dried fruit of your choice, is probably a better choice, but for the likelihood of eating many more than 140 calories at once."
2,Not for the real health conscious,"This is the sort of bar that you would find in the grocery store. Nature Valley is a General Mills product. Very average, and you wouldn't expect much from it. The second ingredient (to whole grain oats) is high maltose corn syrup. Not an optimal ingredient, as we are learning. The other ingredients are eh, so so. They taste fine, a bit sweet, but edible. There are 3 grams of protein in each bar, 140 calories, and each bar weighs 1.2 ounces. That is about 4 bites worth for most adults, probably average for these kinds of ""grocery store"" bars. On the plus side, if you are need something that doesn't melt; chocolate coatings, etc. this would work for you."
1,Never left the warehouse,"I would love to review this product. However, it was shipped and never left the warehouse. It's been two weeks -- still sitting there."
2,filling but not tasty,"Well, it's filling, and fairly low-calorie at 140 for the bar. I had high hopes for this bar, given the promise of fruit and nuts, which is reinforced by the packaging that prominently features pictures of raisins, almonds, peanuts and cranberries. Opening the package is the first of the disappointments. The primary ingredient is oats, followed closely by corn syrup. Tiny specks of cranberry, raisin and almond, with a few peanut chunks. The flavor is very sweet with a bitter aftertaste. This is not a product I would recommend or choose to purchase."
4,"Mostly a ""pro"" but one big ""con""","Fresh, chewy, flavorful, good ingredients -- except for one. Too much sugar. Make it 1/3 to 1/4 less sweet, and we could also say healthy. As it is now, I won't be buying much more of this product. I'm trying to eat well, and with all that sugar, I can't include this as such. It's got plenty of flavor, just remove a little of the sugar."
4,Wonderful snack,"The fruit and nut are an enjoyable, chewy, satisfying snack. True your kids may not jump for joy, especially if they don't like the mashed dried fruit and lack of chocolate chips or other enticing bits, but these are handy for my on the go, at work, and to just get an energy boost when needed."
2,Not a lot of fruits or nuts,"Too sweet to my taste, the picture shows a lot more fruits and nuts that the bar actually has."
4,"Great, nutritional snack","This is a tasty and convenient snack to carry along. I usually bring these with me when I go golfing. Each bar contains 25 grams of carbs, so avoid these if you are on a low carb diet. If you want fiber, then you should probably try one of the fiber-enriched bars, as these contain only 1 gram of fiber. But each bar does have a nice assortment of nuts; almonds, peanuts and sunflower.Coincidentally, I received these from Amazon on Earth Day, and was therefore a little more conscious of how these are packaged. You could easily fit at least two more bars in the box. But we all know the manufacturer wants it to appear that you are getting more than you really are, hence the bigger box.Worth a try!"
2,Bars recently changed and are much worse!!,"Shame on Nature Valley for trying to pull the wool over our eyes! If you were a fan of these bars when they first came out, then be warned. The recipe has changed and the bars are much different and NOT for the better. Not only are they much smaller, they also contain far fewer nuts/fruit and the bar itself now has an airier consistency like the Rice Krispie's treat.How do I know all this? I bought these bars on a regular basis from Costco and still had some leftover bars from the first batch and I was able to compare them side by side. These were always my favorite hiking snack and now they aren't much better than every other bar out there. I think Nature Valley will quickly regret its decision once they realize that their are a lot of unhappy customers. I'd gladly pay a little extra if it meant keeping the bars the way they were.If you don't believe me then by all means buy them and judge for yourself."
1,Terribly false advertising,"I had my hopes for this bar. The box reads ""Fruit & Nut - Almond, Raisin, Peanut, and Cranberry"", but after taking my first bite, I was surprised by the actual ingredients. The first two ingredients in the nutritional information are Oats and High Maltose Corn Syrup. This is not a fruit and nut bar. It is a grain bar with some fruit and nuts sprinkled in. There are far better products, including ones with almonds and fruits as the main ingredients, and with honey sticking the ingredients together instead of a boat load of corn syrup. I am completely dissatisfied and amazon doesn't offer returns on this product so save yourself some money and buy a better bar."
3,They're OK,"I guess I'm a little spoiled on Kashi TLC. I tried these since someone had said they were comparible and my local store had them on sale for a great price. These seem a little too sugar filled for me personally. They're sticky, and those sunflower seeds give them a kind of ""off"" taste. I like the chewiness but I think overall Kashi TLC bars are better."
4,History of the Cherokee Indians and Their Legends,"Very interesting book. Looking for answers to some family history, but alas not there. No fault of book, just hoping I would find something."
3,But it's ok,It is not the product I wanted. I was looking for the entire album instead of just the one song. But it's ok otherwise. The product came in good condtion and I like the song.
3,"MEDIUM, MORE LIKE SMALL","I use medium sized slides, but this one is a tad smaller and barely fits. Order one sizes larger and should be great. I like it other wise. The ceramic has a lot warmer tone, compared to glass or metal. The interior is porous and provides a good grip. It got some wait and feels solid. I will buy other one, this time size larger."
2,Way Too Big and Fading Quality,"I had a wonderful size small of this slide years ago until it shattered from a fall on a ceramic floor. They no longer make them in small so I ordered a medium. It hangs about an inch past the end of my pinky and just flops around all over the place. I also seem to recollect a nice meaty material with super porous lining. If you have a 4 inch pinky about 3/4 in diameter, go nuts !!"
2,"I usually like Dave Barry, but...","I have read several of his books, but this one seemed a lot less funny than most of the others I have read. Not sure exactly what it is about this one, perhaps the topic, or the fact that the same jokes are used over and over. I am having a hard time finishing this one and I usually blaze through Dave Barry books in one or two sittings."
5,If only it had REALLY happened this way....,"This is a dead-on satire of a history text, minus the ""really dull parts"" (treaties, dates, actual facts, etc) but including such gems as ""Elizabeth, who was called the Virgin Queen because it was not considered a smart move to call her the Really Ugly Queen..."" And so on, and on, and on...there's too much fun here to quote in detail, but I especially like the Founding Fathers' letter from Visa (""if you do not pay...we will regretfully have to return you to British rule""), the South's attempt to recruit help, pre-slavery (""Are you that special kind of guy or gal who's willing to work long hours for no pay...plus we get to keep your children?"") and of course the Carter years (""A Relieved Nation Learns It Does Not Actually NEED a President""). This book -- like all Barry's work -- should be mandatory reading for anyone in imminent danger of taking life too seriously."
1,"Silly, but Not Humorous","Dave Barry is said to be a very funny guy. This book does not support that evaluation. He would probably make a good script writer for the Three Stooges, but they might be disappointed as well. Barry fails to find humor, irony, or even a chuckle in the various events that comprise our country's history. Instead he uses the events as props for making juvenile, silly jokes."
5,DAVE Barry,Dave Barry does history. Really. I had to stop reading it at times because i was shaking the room with my laughter. And you'll never think of October eighth the same way. An amazing bit of nonsense.
5,A very funny book.,"I used to regularly read Dave Barry's syndicated columns.Many of his books are collections of old columns, and I didn't particularly like them.His original books are very funny, including this one. It is hilarious.If, like me, you like irreverant political satire, this book will not disappoint you."
5,Hilarious,"I found this book completely hilarious, and History is my least favorite subject. I borrowed it from a friend at school and finished it before dinner. I tried to read it out loud to my mom, but I didn't get very far because we were laughing so hard that I couldn't talk and she couldn't listen. (She finished it on her own.) Definitely worth reading."
2,calc for chemistry students,"the keys absolutely suck, they don't register right so when you try to do 2+2+2+2+2, it instead reads as 22+2+22, not a good calculator, i recommend getting the higher up TI's if you can"
2,"Lousy buttons, mediocre screen","I have always loved TI calculators, but the buttons on this calculator are too hard to press. Sometimes it feels like you pressed the number, but it does not register on the screen. It does not happen too often, but it is often enough that you have to constantly look at the screen while you are entering numbers just to make sure they registered.The screen is also a little washed out. After cursing my new TI-30X IIS a number of times, I bought aCasio FX-300MS Plus 229-Function Scientific Calculator, and what a difference! The buttons always register, and the screen has great contrast. Unfortunately, my days of trusting TI calculators are over."
5,i love this thing,Im a P2 and this calculator has made my life so much easier in pharmacy school. I wished i purchased this thing sooner. So much easier then using those old school single line calculators. My $100 graphing calculator is basically a paper weight since they are not allowed in any of my classes since HS.
5,Good Calculator,Solid Texas Instruments product. My son uses it for his school work and it always does the job. What else can you say.
1,Garbage-very slow in accepting keystrokes,DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE.I am not a very fast typer but this calculator is too slow and does not accept the keystrokes if not enough time is given in-between the key strokes.Hence I almost always mess up the calculation.
5,School says i need this,This is the only caluclator that our school approves of...must be a good one if they only want you to buy one.
2,Listen to the reviews! Buy the newer model!,"This calculator is okay.The Good: The key layout is familiar, it has high functionality, it is rugged and long lasting.The REALLY Bad: Precision is key on a calculator, one wrong stroke can make the difference between shooting the moon and crashing a satellite, so to speak. If you type too quickly on this calculator it will skip entries and only log the ones it catches. This problem is compounded by the fact the characters on the screen are very large, so the screen can only hold so much of a operation on the screen at a time. This makes it time consuming to check for errors.The Ugly: I hate plugging other products in reviews, but the other 2 star ratings are right. If you want the familiar layout, the functionality, the rugged construction, and precise key entry, get a newer model of the TI-30 series. This calculator is fine for homework and leisure calculations, but in a time crunched test it will end up becoming a test of your patience."
3,Casio is better,"Had one of these a long time ago in middle school, now I'm a college senior. I stopped using it when the LCD decided to call it quits for no reason (an 8 would look like a 3). The buttons are super mushy and the calculator only lets numbers be entered *very* slowly. So slow, in fact, you have to waste time checking the screen to make sure it didn't miss a button press. The lid is more snap-on than slide on, so it wears out really fast.Replaced it with a Casio FX-300MS that I still have/use to this day...8 years later. It has more functions, less wasted space (just look at the huge bezel around the screen on the TI), short stroke fast button response, and faster computation speed. However, if you are looking for a graphing calculator, no competition hands down the TI-89 Titanium wins (I mainly use that calculator nowadays).In summary, there is no reason to buy this calculator over a Casio."
4,TI calculator,this is a good product especially if you know how to use a calculator. It will get you through your 5th-8th grade math courses and some high school.
1,horrible button design,Only bought this because my university requires this type of calculator. The buttons are extremely hard to use. You have to press very hard to make sure the number/operator is selected.
3,It's just okay,"This is my third Texas Instruments calculator. I also have a TI-84 and a Voyage 200, both of which I love. I bought this one because I needed a no-frills scientific calculator for my Diff Eq class. I didn't have a lot of money to spend, so this one seemed to fit the bill. I wish I had gone to a bricks and mortar store and tried it against some other ones, though. It has all the functions I want, including storing the previous answer, but the buttons don't always register a key press. It is really frustrating to be in the middle of a test and have the calculator get temperamental. It is especially bad when I don't notice it happened and mess up a problem because the button didn't register. It's not an issue with the buttons being difficult to press, either. The button presses just don't get picked up some times."
2,I hate the buttons on this calculator!,"I had to get this calculator for a professional engineers' exam (it was one of 4 approved calculators to take into the test). I've been using it to study and HATE how difficult the buttons are to press. I'm quite speedy on my Texas Instruments TI-82 but this one is painfully rigid. I originally thought it was a good idea to go with an approved calculator that resembled by TI-82 to most so I wouldn't have to relearn where all the functions are. Now, I'm second-guessing that decision and hope I'm not too fast on it during the exam so that I don't come up with wrong answers. My fingers are crossed but I really do not like this calculator so far... if you have a choice, go with another one."
1,keys not responsive,"When I try to type quickly on this calculator, I often find there are missed keys(not wrong keys, but skipped). It gets pretty annoying if you use it regularly."
1,"Have to double check your inputs. I hate this calculator, too!",This calculator bounces every time I press a button. I always have to check what I entered and even double check the problem. It takes almost twice the time to solve problems than using a different model.
1,POS,"this calculator is horrible. it takes a second for the keys to register, which really slowed me down, this can also cause mistakes, which healthee said, so if you don't go slow, you'll mess up. Also, it takes a lot longer than a better calculator to perform an operation. It doesn't have as many functions as a calculator for $2.50 more (link at end). The ONLY good thing about this is that it's light, but thats because it doesn't have all the good in it. BuyTI-30XS Multiview Calculatorinstead, its a much better calculator. DO NOT BUY ThIS."
4,Missing commas as separators,"I have the TI 30X-IIS, a nice dual power, 2 line calculator. It has one feature missing, the fraction bar key, that another TI has. Other than that, pretty much the perfect machine for me... except it does not use a comma in numbers to separate the thousands place: it displays ten-thousand as 10000 instead of my preference 10,000I know, most people probably do not care, I must have some kind of dyslexia because when I see 4589339 I have no idea what that is, as compared to 4,589,339 which I instantly recognized as 4 million, 5 hundred thousand,etc.I'm looking around for another calc, one that has a 2 line display, that works with fractions and decimal conversions, the basic stuff, AND displays numbers with the lil' comma. I would prefer a TI."
4,good buy,It was sold out at our stores and I recieved it in a couple of days in the mail. Good choice
3,Just a calculator,"I bought this calculator specifically because it was the scientific calculator approved for use on SOA/CAS actuarial exams. It has some nice features for such an inexpensive calculator. Its two line display is nice for keeping track of what you've done and avoiding typos, and it can do some fairly heavy duty statistics. It's also very easy to chain commands together.I have almost never used this calculator outside of exams. Everything it does well is faster and easier with a graphing calculator (I've regularly used a TI-82 and a TI-84 Plus).I've had to buy 2 of these because the first one I bought broke after about three months. The second has worked fine for over two years."
2,Keypad problems,"Ugh, I just opened this calculator and I'm sorely disappointed. I wish I had read the reviews more carefully, particularly the 2 and 3-star reviews. I bought this calculator because it was one of the bestselling basic calculators and had a 4-star average. I wish I had read the lower star reviews a bit more carefully. Like several other reviewers have noted, the main problem with this is the keypad. I just tested the calculator with a few basic calculations and it frequently does not register a key strike. I bought this calculator so I could do basic math for my tests, and there's no way I'm going to rely on this calculator because it's very easy to hit a key, think you punched in a number that doesn't register, leading to a wrong answer. It's entirely unreliable.I got this calculator because it was relatively inexpensive and fit my needs, but I will end up spending more money just to buy another calculator that actually works properly."
2,the calculator I received is not the same color as the picture.,"As I said in the title. The picture is a blue one, but I received an orange one."
4,"Good calculator, flimsy case","This calculator has all the functions I need for a graduate level statistics class. I especially like the 2-line display, which makes it easy to type in long strings of numbers without forgetting your place. The only reason I failed to give this calculator 5 stars is the case. It is incredibly flimsy and leaves me with no sense of certainty that the calculator is safe bouncing around in my bag.EDIT: I have had this calculator almost 3 years now and the ""flimsy"" case is still intact, even though it has been bouncing around in my bag all this time. It still works and the case still protects it. I guess it's not that flimsy after all."
4,Works good,Good basic scientific calculator. Works good. Does its job. No FX button for those of you that need a calculator with out one. This is perfect and cheap.
3,buttons are not easy to push,"it's function is normal, but I don't satisfied with the buttons, they are not sensitive enough, so everytime you have to carefully push each button to input a number, not to strong to input twice and not to slight otherwise you have to type again."
4,Son uses it for algebra II,"Son needed a calculator for his math class. I saw that amazon had a calculator with functions that he need for his class. The calculator was gong to be sent to me in a few days and looked really good. son didn't complain that the claculator was missing any functions, so I'm happy."
3,"The ""TI-30x""","I purchased this on the recommendation of my instructor, because she said that it was simpler to use than the ""TI-83/TI-89"", N O T! As I write this it sits on a shelf collecting dust - will probably put it in a yard sale - with the new batteries."
1,Not user friendly,"This calculator disappointed me. When doing almost any calculation I must push far more buttons than on any other calculator I have used.A few examples:Why do x2, sqrt etc have to be followed by a =?.If you push for example + in error instead of -, you must back up and delete the + before you push -, otherwise you get a syntax error.Some of the most common functions are secondary functions.I prefer HP's calculators to any calculator. I don't expect the same user friendliness from a TI calculator but this one is irritatingly slow and wastes too much time.I cannot recommend this calculator."
1,Absolutely useless,"When typing fast, this calculator seems to log less than 3/4 of my keystrokes. This is due to the processing speed of the calculator and not related to the pressure or finger positioning while typing. As a result, I must search through every equation on a piss poor 2 line screen in order to make sure that it was received correctly. This calculator is so bad that it actually earned me an F on my last exam. TI should track down everyone that has purchased one of these calculators and pay the owners for pain and suffering."
5,Works well,I bought this for my son for high school. It is easy to use and works well. I would recommend this to others looking for a good scientific calculator at a reasonable price.
2,Drops numbers if you press too fast; causes mistakes,"College graduate, currently studying for professional exams.This calculator will not print numbers or register buttons if you press them too quickly of each other. That is, if you try to press ""123456789"" as fast as your two index fingers will allow you, you'll get ""1369.""I spent ten minutes reviewing a problem, trying to find out what I did wrong, to find out that this calculator dropped a ""2"" from ""1122.4"" when I pressed the ""2"" key too quickly.A calculator that causes mistakes is not a calculator I would recommend"
1,Subpar,"It sometimes doesn't want to cut on, and you have to push certain buttons repeatedly in order to put the numbers in."
3,buy a better one,"it works well, but the hands doesn't feel well typing it. Buy one with a better screen, at least."
5,The Best Calculator for Algebra,"Excellent calculator, perfect for all levels of College Algebra. Would recommend to anyone who's attending College. Unbeatable price! Very Satisfied!!!"
4,TI scientific calculator,Great calculator for the price. I needed basic functionality for everyday engineering and this has it. 2-line display is a plus. Solar power should make it last many years. Keyboard could be a bit more tactile but works OK
5,scientific calculator,This is a great calculator. It does everything I thought it would do and more. I wish I would have purchased this a long time ago when school first started. I am very pleased. I have tried others and this one is more user friendly.
5,Good scientific calculator,"This is my favorite of the basic scientific calculators. For less than $15, you can't beat it. Obviously it isn't going to have as many function as a TI89, but it still has a surpassingly large amount for the price, even basic stats functions."
4,Satisfied,Wonderful product and the seller is top notch. Would purchase product again and agian from this seller.
3,OK,"This is an ok calculator: it does the job, has a reasonably good feature set, and reasonably good display. The buttons feel cheap and don't always respond; the cover is a piece of junk and has never properly locked in place. This is an inexpensive calculator and that is reflected in the quality of the components. If you need a calculator for occasional use, this one will do fine; if you want a calculator that you will like using regularly or for many years, look elsewhere."
2,An alright calculator for 2004,"Length:: 0:47 MinsI needed a calculator for my chemistry class and I couldn't use my graphing one that I've had for the last six years so I went ahead and ordered this because it was the best selling scientific one from TI. Little did I know that it is an OLD model. I would avoid this product and go for the newer version of the TI-30! The TI-30XS is the same price and is much more usable and has more features! The buttons on this calculator are VERY loose and make data entry tricky for fast calculation. One must constantly verify that each button press has been recognized. These loose buttons are annoying if you are accustomed to quick calculations. It makes the calculator essentially unusable. I expected much more from Texas Instruments, as I really adore my 83+SE, but this is an utter disappointment.I wish amazon had alerted me to the new version (as they do with some other products).ALL POTENTIAL BUYERS, GET THIS ONE INSTEAD:TI-30XS Multiview Calculator"
3,"Calculator works, it was blue.","The calculator works just fine, although the product shipped was a bright blue calculator. Doesn't change the functionality, just doesn't look like the picture."
4,Fine Calculator but buttons a bit small,"No problems, calculator did everything I needed it to do. Only drawback is the buttons are a bit small so I cannot tap the keys quickly."
5,Great Calculator,"I bought this calculator for more advanced calculations, and it had all the features I needed, and wans't expensive at all. I would recommend this calculator to middle school and high school students who need a calculator that fits their classroom needs, but a college-level students may need a more advanced calculator."
1,Glue is fine; dispenser is faulty,"Loctite makes fine products, but be wary of this item. The syringe dispenser is not airtight. That means that the volatile hardener dries out within several weeks, leaving the entire package useless. Buy this only if you plan to use the entire contents in a week or two. Otherwise, look for Loctite epoxy products that come in separate containers with screw-on tops."
3,3 blu eyes soul sisters,"Ms Adventures a trio of 3 sisters kindra, charity, and amy morriss. They have clear,pristine vocals. their debut cd constist of r&b;, pop dance tracks typical of 1990. Undeniable was the first release. This track has the biggest r&b; influence on, resembles Tara Kemp ""piece of my heart""""Heaven"" is a great ballad that shows of their vocals a definate stand out. Other tracks are similar to Paula abduls first cd ""forever your girl"" rightly so , since they shared the same producer Elliott Wolf. overall it's a decent cd..if you enjoy music by Sweet Sensation, paula Abdul, Debbie Gibson,cover girls and Tara Kemp you'll enjoy this cd.tracksundeniableif the shoe fitseverybody ele's loveras long as i'm with yougamesheat of the nightmr heart breakheavendon't lead me onall dressed up"
1,Poorly executed,"Not only are the cryptograms unedited, but the paper is poor--very thin and my pencil scratched holes. The puzzles are either too easy, too hard, or poorly edited. Too bad. I love cryptograms and have done zillions. Longing for a good, new book with good paper, letters and lines properly spaced, and fun quotes. I'll keep looking. Can't recommend this."
1,full of errors,Bought this for a gift and all I hear about are the errors throughout the book. Would not recommend.
1,Why equals Why,"If you don't mind the same letters equaling the same letters, it's interesting. However ""Y"" may equal ""y"" in one quote, and in the next quote ""m"" might equal ""m"". It's very confusing & not well edited."
2,Casual Amusement,This book is a nice enough collection of more than 600 puzzles for one's enjoyment but is hardly more than a simple introduction to the most common codes and ciphers. It repeats the same general knowledge usually found by a simple internet search on cryptography.
2,poor picture quality,"Among my collection this DVD has the worst picture quality. I had expected beautiful pictures underlining a romantic love story. The story itself seems little inspired and even a better technical quality would not add more than one additional star, particularly in consideration of the price."
4,warriors,"i enjoyed it greatly hope to see more doc films in the future,to learn about ones true heritage is very important and is not what is always taught in our schools"
3,No more real butter,"Pop Secret Homestyle used to be my favorite brand of popcorn. It had the perfect blend of salt and butter...when it was made with real Land o' Lakes butter. The last two cases I ordered did NOT have real butter in them. They were both of the Homestyle flavor, but neither had the ""Made with real Land o' Lakes butter"" graphic on the boxes. The boxes in this last case of popcorn I ordered was merely labelled ""a taste of butter"", and was listed in the ingredients as ""artificial and natural flavoring"". I've written to the company asking why they took out the real butter, but they have yet to respond. I don't know why they'd change the recipe when it was so good before. I hope they change it back. In the Amazon pages for both the 8-6 packs and the 12-3 pack boxes, the picture shows the box with the real butter graphic on them, but that's not what I ended up with."
1,They ruined the perfect popcorn.,"I'm a fairly fit guy but was so addicted to the original ""made with LandoLakes"" forumla that I ran 2 miles before every bag. Now that they've replaced the natural butter with artificial tar, I don't need to run because I end up vomiting. Don't be fooled and don't buy this popcorn. They changed the formula and the new stuff leaves a thick film on the roof of your mouth that takes steel wool to remove. Shame on this company for trusting the half-wits who decided fake butter was better than real. We're not dumb. We know the difference. Your popcorn went from the best stuff on the market to the biggest joke in my lower intestine."
2,My last purchase had a formula change,"My last purchase of this popcorn had powdered salt vs. grain salt. It was a little more saltier and the artificial butter taste changed the enjoyment and quality. I recently purchased a large box. I hope this batch is not like the ""new"" formula. If it is, I won't be buying any more."
3,Very basic,Knowing what I know now I would have bought the Triton Master DVD. This DVD is very basic......there was little I didn't know already. It is well done and concise. So if you are truly a beginner ....this may be the DVD for you.
1,Different from what was ordered,According to the description was the Spanish edition .. I'm very unhappy and upset because they did not send me what I bought
4,looks so real!,"I purchased this wallpaper for a small space in my kitchen from the chair rail down. One double roll only covered alittle over 13 ft across after matching the pattern ( 28in down). I had to reorder a second roll to finish the project. I recommend you order double what you expect to use. It was worth it, I got the look I wanted"
4,good real brick looking wallpaper,"Product came on time and in good packing. easy to install, we put the role in the shower tub and took out in 5seconds. make sure before you start installing to see that the paterns will match at the top for connecting piece. there will be little bit of wastage during this.Also the patterns on each line are same, i thought they could have made it little random. but overall it is great product."
5,Honor through Survival,"My War succeeds in demonstrating the motivations of this famous Japanese holdout from World War II. Onoda excused himself very little, which actually helps give a sympathetic understanding of the man. This is a pleasant blend of survival, history, and personal memoir. The reflections on his youth are especially useful in humanizing Onoda. His determination might not be praised as highly in our more politically correct terrain, but he carried out what he was trained to do. There is reason that the Japanese were overwhelmed with emotion upon his return decades later. His persistence bestowed the honor that defeat withheld."
3,Worth reading!,"An interesting look at one mans war. This book tells of its authors survival and his thoughts as he lived in the jungle, and fought a war that had ended 30 years ago. He explains why he didn't believe that the war had ended, and how he survived, and evaded capture for so long."
5,Captivating!,"For someone who doesn't know much about the Kronos Quartet or Phillip Glass and who dabbles in classical music in general, I must say that this CD is one of my alltime favorite CDs. The music is intricate and haunting, I have listened to this CD more than 200 times and I don't seem to tire of it. I first heard one of the String Quartet No. 3 tracks on a Delta flight while on my way to Italy last year and couldn't get it out of my mind. This has been one of my most treasured purchases. If you like quartets & have a thing for ambient type music, you must buy this CD!!"
5,My longstanding favorite single CD...,"I'm no musician, I just know what I like. I like each work of this CD in the way I assume it was intended to enter the listener. At times, it's purely mathematical, wonderfully somber and psychologically reflexive. This is the CD I can't bring myself to turn off for any reason: no interuption seems enough to ever make me stop listening."
5,"Simplicity of string music, and evocations","An excelent disc in this (relatively) new american music, one may call minimalist music, where the repetitions and the arpeges create an environment full of emotions, where the composer is not afraid of the simplicity of the writing, the periodicity of the music. A very exiting and evocating music... Steve Reich, John Adams, and Goreky (3rd Symphony) also composed music of this kind. And also Riley and Satie (vexations). You may also look for other masterpieces of Glass..."
1,Too Bad There Isn't a Way to Put -0- Stars,"I can't believe anyone would rate this noise higher than a 1. If you like the sound of chainsaws needing servicing, then perhaps you'll enjoy this CD. My husband called it ""sounds to fight with your spouse to"". The folks who gave this 4 or 5 stars must be ""shills""...they are probably in the band, or are the composer. I'm so disappointed in the CD that I plan to request a refund from Amazon."
4,sweet film...,"This really is a sweet film. Not the strongest plot mind you, if you're looking for something complex. But beautifully done. Anyone the least bit artistically inclined will enjoy the imagery. And I for one can relate to Uma's character trying to pound her way back into the house after Dad (Dabney) has struck a deal and moved the kids out. My parents had my bed apart 20 minutes BEFORE I left for college. Tee-hee... Eagerly awaiting the DVD release (hint hint)..."
4,Give it a Chance!,"Now keep in mind I saw this movie when I was younger, but when I saw it I loved it I thought it was great and soon after became an Uma Thurman fan. I have been looking fo this movie for years now and I am very happy I found it. I plan to purchase it and watch it again and will write another review if my views have changed."
4,Great Stuff!!!,"This is one of Uma Thurman's first films. It's a heartwarming story story of familial relationships during good times and bad. The art is one of the things that make this interesting viewing, and the cast is excellent."
5,lovely,"just caught this movie on hbo, and was hoping to buy it here on Amazon as I thought is was incredibly beautiful. Story maybe not the strongest, but enjoyable. What got me was the unbelievably enchanting ""human"" paintings. It's nice to see a movie that for once gives space to visual art, and gives the viewer the time to appreciate it. For this alone I would like to own this movie."
4,where the heart is dvd,"Just to let anyone know, this dvd is a widescreen edition. Which (to me) is the most important feature. If you were hoping for any bonus features, there are none (not even the trailer). The movie itself, and the fact that it is in widescreen, should be enough reason to purchase it."
1,"If I could give it anything below 1 star, I would!","Dabney Coleman, Uma Thurman, and Christopher Plummmer severly damage their careers in this horrible excuse for a comedy! Great idea for a story, but this hideous film sends it all straight to hell!"
3,It works.,"I ordered it on September 11th, and i just got it today, September 17th. Shipping is normal, and it did get here on time. I have a Fender Acoustic guitar, and i decided to try the elastic capo because the K- capos are kind of expensive. I had no idea that the one i ordered was for Classical guitars with mylon strings. It didnt say anything in the description about it. I tried it out, and it does work enough, but the strings are muted."
3,You get what you pay for.,"Item arrived on time. Item was brand new, no missing parts .. arrived as said. Loved how quickly you can addjust it. Ok sound, doesnt necessary sound perfect, but it does fine."
2,Disappointing,"I don't like to take up much space with negative music reviews, but from time to time I feel the urge to let readers know that although I often advocate ""classical"" music by contemporary composers, I am not necessarily a sucker for every new orchestral piece that comes along. I was really excited to see that a violin concerto by John Adams has been recorded by no less a luminary than Gidon Kremer, but no matter how many times I listen to this work, I find it a wholly unrewarding experience. Shaker Loops is better, but has already been recorded in several versions, so there is nothing about this disk that truly merits a recommendation."
2,"Too unbelievable, even for the romance genre","Peggy J. Herring certainly knows how to make her novels hot and sexy but this one is so unbelievable. THe things that happen and that you find out able Valerie fall into the realm of the 'Twilight Zone' and the happily ever after is just too sugary to be believed. Great love scenes, though, if that's all you're intereted in but too far out even for me."
2,Not Impressed,"I need to protect my cat from the massive deer tick population in the Hudson Valley. Going on week 4 of my most recent application of Frontline Plus: I spent Saturday morning pulling 6 ticks from my cat's ears and neck. Not sure if any of them were dead. Most were visibly active and attaching, or already having a meal.Merial's web site says ticks will die within 48 hours and will be killed simply by coming in contact with the cat's fur. This makes no sense. In 48 hours a tick will climb through fur, attach and do damage. Frontline Plus is pricey enough that it should work as implied. I 'd like to be able to count on a product that offers protection to, y'know, actually protect. I either need to apply this every 3 weeks -- or find another product.I give it two stars as it worked for three weeks."
1,Does not work well,"I have bought Frontline Plus for my cat from Sams Club and Amazon and I must say it is a complete waste of money. By week 2 my cat always gets fleas. I thought the first time I bought it ""Its just a fluke, I will try it again because some people have had great results"".... boy was I wrong. I had to fumigate my house TWICE! I now use Advantage for Cats and it works wonderfully."
4,it works,"So far its the best product I've tried. If your cat goes outside alot and there are other animals in area your best bet is to reapply every 3 weeks instead of 4 weeks. I think it works better the Revolution, hertz (almost killed the cat), just a flea collar, or regular Frontline."
3,Didn't work that well,I have 2 kittens and 1 cat. I used this product on all of them and to my surprise it didn't work that well. It seemed to work the best on my long-haired girl kitten because she stopped scratching for a few days but now has started back. It seemed to reduce the population of the fleas but it didn't eliminate them. And I notice that all of them are scratching their ears now. Maybe they ran in there?I would say this product will probably work better if you treat your entire house and the pets at the same time. I will try this product again because it did work better than the products I bought from the store.
2,Didn't Kill the Fleas this Time,I've used this product for years but for some reason this time the stuff didn't kill the fleas. I had to wait a month and then use another product that did work.
3,Not perfect but works.,This was the 1st time I used this product. It didn't last the entire month but it DID help a lot. I noticed a lot less scratching from my cats and so I'm hoping that after I use it for 3 full months that I will REALLY see a major difference.I recommend it.
4,Frontline Plus for Cats,"I ordered Frontline Plus from Amazon because of the great price and prompt service, the product works wonderful and would use this again."
1,Used to work... not anymore!,"I've used Fronline on my cats for a few years, however recently it's stopped working. The fleas haven't been affected by this for the past 3 months. We are going crazy with fleas! I'm switching to a different product!!"
3,Sorta Works,"Started out by spraying yard and house with Home Defense (with animals quarantined), and then vacuuming daily, and applying the product to three cats. Also used the dog version for my dog. After about two weeks, the cats are infested again, and the fleas on the cats are not dieing when biting the cat and getting the frontline blood in their systems. This has been a terrible year for fleas due to rain, so I cannot lay all the blame on the product, but I expected a little better and faster control from such an expensive product. The cats do not go outside. The dog does, but has had very few flea (maybe 5 or 6), and he gets a regular flea shampoo bath."
3,Take care with kittens,"I purchased this product thinking it was safe for kittens. About ten minutes after applying it to two 6 week old kittens, they were stumbling about and drooling. I tried to wipe the excess product off them. Thank fully, they are doing fine now. I have used this product on older animals with no problems. If your kittens are young it would be best to ask your vet about it and only apply it during the hours the vet is in the office in case your kittens experience side effects."
1,No faith in Frontline,"I don't think this product works at all. My two cats have about the same number of fleas whether I use it or not. Perhaps, as others have suggested, fleas have developed resistance to it, or maybe my expectations are too high. I will not buy it again."
5,Price is the Key,Frontline is always quality so the key is who has the lowest price and ships the fastest. This merchant did a good job.
4,"Works well, but not for a whole month.","I have found this product to work really well. We have 2 outdoor cats, so fleas and ticks are a constant problem. Frontline Plus definitely stops them from scratching at fleas and we don't have to pick ticks off of them anymore. The only issue is that they only make it about 3 weeks between doses. After 3 weeks they start scratching again. Since many of the frea treatments for cats don't protect against ticks, we'll probably keep using this product until the weather turns colder and the ticks go away, and then try Advantage or another product."
4,Good flea product,"This is a good flea product, but it is too expensive. I have three cats and the need to be treated each month. One box only goes 2 months. They also end up re-infested by the end of the 4th week, so the six week claim is not true in my situation. I will continue to use Frontline because it is the only product where none of my cats have negative side effects."
2,Smells BAD!,"I bought this frontline product for my indoor cats because I heard that frontline is the best flea prevention. It smells really BAD, like a skunk. I would have bathed my cats after applying but I didn't want the prevention to wear off. I think I'll go back to the cheaper product after this is gone.Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens, 6 Doses"
5,Great Service,"Purchased this product from Amazon dot com and the vender that shipped the product is great was shipped earlier than I was told and expected will be purchasing more product from this vender great work, thank you......."
4,Frontline for Cats,"Initially the product seemed to work for our cats, as the date for the next application got closer, it seems that they are scratching more. Although, in defense of the product, we have only given them one dose. I am anxious to see if the second application kills whatever remaining pests they may have."
1,Did not work,"After I applied it on my cat, my cat always have a tingling reaction with the Frontline solution. But the one I purchased from this seller, for some reason, did not affect my cat at all. Sadly, it didn't help with fleas too.After 3 days or so, I even saw a flea (not sure really what a flea looks like but it must be flea) jumping off my cat's fur. I will not buy from this seller again."
2,"Product Not as Advertised, but works anyway","The product that was delivered was not the product in the picture. I was trying to purchase the discontinued deodorant that was shown in the picture, but instead I was sent the newer deodorant that I could have easily, and for less money, purchased at a local store. Too expensive shipping costs to send back. Very dissapointed. Seller needs to update the picture for this product and stop false advertisement."
1,don't waste your time,"My wife and i bought this product for years and lately it has been pure garbage it doesn't work like it should at all. Your better off buying the ""cheap"" stuff from Walmart or so."
3,Its okay But ...,"It was okay,But I need more and I have 4 Cats and just started back to work. They are NOT HAPPY right now!Because i can't afford to buy more right @ this time.If you can Help Please send me $ free tubes and in the future I will continue to purchase from Your Company."
3,Magical Wonders,"I have mixed this in with my ""Uranium Ore by Images SI Inc."" and right then and there out popped a dragon! we talked for a while about quantum physics and the creation of the universe and then he said, ""get on my back and we'll ride around the magical mountains of Montana!Pro: Works great for magic!Con: Doesn't work on my cats fleas, dragons may eat you in your hallucination."
1,Possibly tampered with,"I just tried to use this product, and I think it was tampered with. Half of the doses were empty, and the internal packaging that keeps the liquid secure was very easily removed. Every other package of Frontline I've used I've had to cut the dosages out of the package. On these ones I just bent them a little and the packaging came off. Of the 3 dosages that had any liquid, it was not very much. I will not be buying this product again."
1,Did NOT work for my animals,I have used the product twice and the animals still have fleas!! Very disappointed after all the money that was spent.
1,My pets got fleas buying frontline from Amazon,"I have been using FrontLine for dogs and cats for years and have historically bought it from the vets. I am a huge shopper on Amazon and decided to do a search to compare the price and found I could save a few dollars (I do rescue so every dollar counts). I put FrontLine on every month and always check for fleas before the next application. Two weeks ago confirmed no fleas and applied the monthly treatment. Just got back from the vets and several pets covered in fleas. Heard about black market FrontLine but thought I would be fine with Amazon. From now on I'll stick to buying from the vet, rather pay more than fight a house filled with fleas."
1,My Poor Kitties,"I was using the protocol which recommends using Frontline one month and then Advantage the next month. Unfortunately, after using Frontline, my poor kitties were scratching non-stop because of their flea infestation. It seemed as if Frontline did not kill a single flea. I had to use Advantage much sooner than recommended because I didn't think they would survive until the next dose was due. I believe that in San Diego (the so-called ""flea capital of the world"") that possibly fleas are becoming immune to these products. This is truly sad news because the products were like a miracle for my animals until recently."
4,Flea Control,I tried Frontline Topspot first without much success. Switched to the Frontline Plus and after 3 treatments the flea population appears to be down considerable but not 100% gone.
1,TOXIC PRODUCT - BE WARNED!,"I am writing to warn people to NOT order pet meds over the Internet as most of these products are counterfeit! A friend is a vet pharmaceutical rep who told me this information and said these products can be highly toxic and lethal. Her company has tested many of these bogus products sold online and at flea markets and their scientists cannot identify the chemicals! Many products come from foreign countries and they are not regulated. I used this product on my two cats last week and they both got sick. Thank God my cats are ok but I am so upset over this incident and don't want anyone else out there to go through heartbreak. If you love your pet, don't scrimp on the money - take them to a vet! Even over the counter pet products can be deadly - the USDA does not enforce pet meds - so sad! Note: I do not blame amazon.com in any way - they are just a seller - I blame the greedy dirtbags who knowingly sell tainted products."
2,Didn't perform as indicated...,"This product worked great at first, but after two to three weeks my poor cat was covered in fleas again. After another application a month later, the fleas were gone at first but came back full force in two to three weeks again. I am not satisfied with this product as it did not perform as stated on the product description ""...monthly treatment kills adult fleas, flea eggs, and flea larvae (preventing development of all flea stages) for up to six weeks and kills ticks for at least one month."" I am hoping we can figure out how to get rid of these fleas. Incidentally, we have tried several other products (shampoo, flea collar, etc.) but nothing has been able to kill all of these pesky fleas. Bottom line, killed the fleas but didn't last. A lot of money was spent for results we have acheived with cheaper products."
2,Waste of money if your cats have already fleas,"I tried this product on my cat who caught fleas recently. It has been 3 weeks and I am still getting bit, there are still fleas when I comb my cat, he still itches and scratches like crazy. This product did nothing what so ever, except killing maybe 4-8 fleas.Two days ago I purchased 'revolution' and I can already see great improvement, I am seeing loads of dead fleas and big ones too. And my cat stopped itching and I haven't gotten bit in 2 days. This product maybe a good way to go to prevent your pet from getting fleas, but not if it already has some. Spend your money on something that works."
1,contents smelled like skunk,The frontline capsules smelled like skunk when opened up -- I was ripped off. Go with a reputable company and spend a little more.
3,took to long,"It took forever to receive this item. the product is fine , we don't understand why it took forever to ship . not sure if we'd order again from them."
2,"Killed some fleas, not all :(","Unfortunately after applying this, my two cats still have fleas a week later. No good!It did kill quite a few of them though"
5,problem with fleas,"My two orange tabbies are beautiful animals, but unfortunately a problem with fleas developed.I tried several products to no avail before I discovered Frontline Plus. It is an absolutelygreat products. Now I use it on a regular basis."
1,Beware,"The product I received was defective (very good chance that is counterfeit)packing look good though the safety blister package open easy. (unlike what I used in the pass that was hard to open) The smell bad, off from what I remembered. The Fleas got worst, I comb them daily for week after treating them. I purchased Bayer Advantage II...Two day cleared them up no fleas. This is the second time I received bad Frontline Plus product from Amazon. I called Frontline to check if was counterfeit product no help, They did say that they only recommend buying from Vets. Remember this product from can not be returned to Amazon that can find.My rating is for this Amazon product. I have used Frontline Plus many time with good results just not what I purchased here, questionable supplier maybe... So Beware."
1,100 percent worthless,Worked less than one week on my cat. Used to be a great product. Not sure if want I got was fake or what.
1,Suspect product was counterfeit.,Have been using this product for years but this vendor ???1) Box didn't seem to be sealed properly when it arrived but appeared to be OK.2) The ampules then seemed to be of a different type of plastic that had to be cut open rather than snap open as usual. Since we have multiple (6) cats to treat we opened them and proceeded to apply the treatment.3) It smelled like Skunk scent!Currently unsure of any effectiveness but I will not order if it comes from this specific vendor again.Waiting on Amazon response...
3,Frontline okay - Advantage better for fleas,"This product is designed for fleas and ticks. It works okay, but did not completely solve our cats' flea problem. Our vet recommended Advantage. A little more expensive but well worth it ... worked MUCH better.Bayer Advantage II Purple 6-Month Flea Control for Cats, 9-Pound"
2,does not work,the first time I use this on all three cats it worked but after that nothing. fleas still there even after professionally having the house deflead. I will be staying with advantage for now on.
2,too strong,"I applied the dose on the cats and both had a red mark sore and the hair come off, I think it was too strong. Jose Arana"
5,It made my cat not have fleas anymore.,"I bought this product because my cat had a bad flea problem. He was sad. Three days after applying this product, my cat no longer had fleas. He is now happy."
1,Does not Work,"I have used Frontline in the past and it worked great. But this batch was terrible. The day that I applied Frontline to my cats, they went nuts scratching while the fleas died. It worked for just a few days and by day 4, the fleas were back. I have to comb them every day to keep the population down. As the month goes on, the fleas get worse and worse until by week 3 I can't wait to try another dose of something help my poor cats. But I can't use Frontline or another heavy duty chemical for at least 30 days. The Frontline box says it will last for 6 weeks. That's a joke! Same review for dog version of Frontline. I had purchased 6 vials so I tried for 3 months with the same results. And the cost is enormous!"
3,It's okay,"Basically, it's okay. My cat scratches and then she doesn't. And then she does again, a little. Not as good as, you know, the other one."
2,Fleas never died,Poor cat never got rid of her fleas. It is frustrating bc its not cheap. Gonna try another brand now.
2,Look at the packaging Very Carefully!,The last box I bought had issues. The dosage was not the same in all of the vials and it looked like some of the product had leaked out. The outer blister package was wy too easy to open. Lot # F41751ASSent the defective vials back to Merial Limited. The remaining vials would not open properly - the score that allows you to bend the end over and snap the product open was not present. Sending them back now too.So I've spent about $100 on 3 doses that are likely expired or otherwise defective.Not all that happy with the cutomer service at Merial - they don't seem to care that it takes MY time and money to send their defective products back to them. Simply replacing the product no longer compensates what I've had to go through so far.Not sure I will continue with this product.
1,Frontline Plus for Cats,"I was really disappointed by this purchase. I have used two of the doses, and they appear to be working, so that's why I didn't return it. However, when it came in the mail, the box was all squished and the inside packaging was coming apart. The medicine stinks like skunk & old beer (but disappeared after about a day), and the years of Frontline usage tells me this isn't normal. I suspect the package I bought is old."
1,simply doesn't work,"I purchased this 3-pack for my cat, who was less than a year old when I got him. There was evidence of flea dirt on him at the time, and I saw a few fleas from time to time, so I decided to treat him. When I applied the first dose, I noticed a few dead fleas in his fur, indicating to me that the product worked, however after just 3 days I noticed live fleas on him again. I used all 3 doses, over the course of 3 months, and they did not work. I then purchased Advantage II for him based on review from pet owners, and within a day he was flea free. He remained flea free between treatments. I won't waste my money on Frontline again. This product is a ripoff."
2,This is not the right stuff,"This is not the stuff you're looking for. Don't be confused by the packaging that looks so much like Bayer Advantage II. I was confused and wasted my money on this. Yes, it did our cat a little bit of good, but Advantage II is so much better.Bayer Advantage II Purple 6-Month Flea Control for Cats 9+ lbs."
1,Epic fail!,"My cat has fleas. That is why I bought this product. 45 days and 2 applications later, my cat STILL has fleas. I used a flea brush on him and found not only more than a dozen fleas (a WEEK after the latest application), but to top it all off, many were egg-laden.The package clearly states that it kills fleas and ""breaks the flea life cycle"". DON'T BELIEVE IT! IT IS A LIE!I have used the Bayer Advantage product in the past with good results, and thought I would try Frontline this time. Big mistake.I would strongly urge you to avoid this product. It simply does not work."
3,Works in some climates,"You should check with your local vet as to what they recommend for flea/tick control in your particular climate. We used Frontline Plus for dog and cat for years, but when we moved to NC, both pets suddenly had fleas. The local vet said the fleas there were immune to it and we had to switch to AdvantageII (cat) and Advantix (dog). Now in Florida, there is a different product that is recommended for the dog (can't remember the name - it's new and only sold by the vets here) because of extra mosquito protection with it. So your local vet is going to be the most help in determining what product is actually going to work for insects in your climate."
1,NOT Vet Recommended,"After taking my cat to the vet to have her spayed, the vet mentioned that she had fleas. I had been noticing small black dots on my cat's fur that according to the vet were ""flea droppings"" from her flea infestation. I had also been noticing some itching, but only after she had visits with dogs, so I assumed the Frontline was killing the fleas on contact...I assumed wrong!The vet said that she had witnessed several cases where Frontline was no longer working and that she recommended Advantage. I have since ordered it and am awaiting its arrival."
5,"Happy Cats, Happy Owner","i have two cats of very different weights and it was always so expensive to buy the flea meds for each cat. When I saw theMerial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens, 6 DosesI wasn't sure if it would work for both my cats. I did a lot of research on line before I bought this because I didn't want to make my girls sick because the dosage was wrong for one or both of them. All that I read said it was safe so I bought the product and it worked wonderfully. Within 24 hours my girls were flea free and they had no negative reaction to the product. As indoor/outdoor cats fleas are always an issue for my girls, so I'm very happy with the results."
1,Waste of Money,"After reading the other reviews, I still decided to purchase, hoping that I would have better luck. My cat weighs 8 pounds and has medium length fur. Used Advantage for the first 4 years of her life, but it had stopped working. Used Frontline once previously a few years prior and it didn't work, so switched back to advantage. But now advantage wasn't working either so we needed to try a new kind. Frontline Plus was a waste of money. It has killed none of her fleas--I applied the first dose a week and a half ago, and applied a second does (after researching online whether it would be okay) at the one week mark. There has been no change. I'm glad I only bought the 3 month supply instead of wasting more money. I should have listened to my intuition, but I didn't and it was a waste of money. Our vet just got Vectra and my mom said it has been amazing on their two cats, so I'm going to try that next. Frontline Plus is definitely not worth it."
5,Great Product......fast shipping,I have been very happy with the quality of products purchased through Amazon and have received all items in a timely manner with great packaging.
5,Peace for my kitties,Product works well for my babies. Never had a problem ordering anything from Amazon. Prices great and sometimes free shipping. Can't beat that.
3,still have fleas,"I am sorry to say that this is the first time in a long time that I have used Frontline and my cats came home with fleas. Usually I use advantage,but thought I would change. I have heard from others that the fleas have become accustomed to this product since it has been available for many years. I don't know for sure, but I switched back to advantage."
1,Frontline Plus for Cats,"I thought I was getting a product aproximately as effective as Advantage, especially for the price (not cheap!). It was as if I put flea vitamins on my cats! They went from just a few to an explosion with no period of reduction. They are scratching all night so now I am sure my home is covered with the little beggars. I don't know when I have been more disappointed in a product! Now I have to reach deep in my pocket again to buy Advantage."
1,Cats hair fell out,"I have always used this product, but this time, where I placed it on my cat.....his hair came out."
5,Flea population %95 gone,"This product has done what it said. The fleas that bite the cats almost all die within a few hours and those that live to lay, their eggs seem mostly infertile. When the eggs do hatch now they die as larva.As maniacal as this sounds, that is a wonderful thing!!We had a absolutely horrific outbreak of fleas due to my daughter adopting a stray cat and the weather swinging to hot and cold extremes causing all the eggs to hatch almost simultaneously.But 2 weeks after applying the frontline-plus the cats and my family had mostly stopped scratching. Then we bombed with pyrithrin fog.Now it has been 3 weeks and the fleas seem %98 gone.We are applying the next round next week. and bombing again the week after that.Hopefully we will be 99% flea free after that. This is impressive in a flea-pron area like Midtown Sacramento, CA.I will be reordering this product for the rest of the summer and for early fall."
3,does what it is supposed to do,"i wish that this stuff wasn't made with nasty chemicals. it works great, but my cats hate it. they have learned to recognize the sound of me opening the packages and they run and hide when they hear it. after i put it on them, they both slink around really low to the ground and are all skittish. they usually act like this for the next 4-6 hours. i'm not sure if it's burning their skin or what. i give it 5 stars for effectiveness, but 1 star for pet-friendliness."
3,So far works...,"Product did not come in the usual box and separted portioned vials, it came in a small amber bottle with no markings and a syringe. Was totally not expecting that, there was no discription of that when I purchased it. However, in the package I received was the description of what it was and how much to use with the syringe. Was a little hesitant to use, because you never know, however so far it is working. The syringe/bottle method was pretty messy to use and I ended up spilling some of the contents."
1,My cat had an allergic reaction to this product...,"My 8 year old cat suffered what my vet called 'a rare allergic reaction' to this product. The vet also said 'too bad, too, as it is the best product of its kind on the market'.Within 24 hours of its application, my cat had bald burned spot about the size of two quarters. The skin looks like a chemical burn - irritated, pink and bit gooey. The vet said to apply OTC topical hydrocortisone cream and that it is possible the fur will not grow back in the affected area. In any case, the cat is on the mend.I called the toll free number on the Frontline box and spoke with a vet tech. He documented the cat's reaction and medical condition. He also said to send the remaining product back to Frontline for a full refund, which was a nice surprise.I am not saying not to use this product, just keep an eye on your pet if you do."
1,Danger to my cats,"When this product arrived, it was not Frontline Plus as advertised, but a completely different product, Frontline Combo. After doing research and visiting the veterinarian with the product, I discovered that this product is not for legal sale in the U.S. and, according to the vet, could be harmful to my cats. I called Merial, the maker of Frontline, directly, and they offered to replace this product for free. I will be sending them my receipt so that they can follow up with this seller. I am appalled by this, and can only imagine what may have happened had I not followed up on my suspicions. I hope that other pet-owners have not experienced harm by using incorrect products on their pets. I will do my best to help Merial get to the bottom of this issue."
1,Smelly...not the product I have bought before,"I have been buying Frontline for years now. Periodically I will buy it through Amazon when I don't see it on sale at Costco. But this time when I received the package and opened one of the applicators it smelled just like a skunk. I thought maybe it was just the applicator material but when I applied the solution to my cat, she stunk like a skunk for 2 days. I don't know if they changed the solution or if I got a bad batch."
1,This product had no effect what-so-ever.,"I've been using Frontline Plus, purchased from my vet for years. The packaging I buy from the vet looks identical to the package I received in this order. When I opened the vial to apply the product, I noticed an unusual odor, like a skunk smell. I applied the product according to the directions the way I always have. At the time of application, I noticed 1 or 2 fleas on my cats. After the first application, there were no results. In fact the fleas were multiplying. I vacuumed and cleaned all rugs and furniture in the house (didn't notice any fleas anywhere accept on the cats). I applied the product again a few weeks later. Again- no results. The cats are now infested. I am on my way to purchase the REAL product. Do not waste your money on this fake frontline."
2,frontline plus order,"I ordered frontline for my cats because I am told it is a great product.I get it cost more because it is good but, why is it when I ordered the producton Oct.1,2010 it will not be sent out until or around Oct.12-14,2010???????I ordered it from Amazon because I needed it real bad & they have never let me down,until now.They took my money right away so why do I have to wait so long? I just don't think it is real fair & if I would have caught that it would take so long I wouldn't have ordered it from here.My cats have flea's now !!!"
3,it worked but not fully,i purchased frontline for my 3 adult cats. it has worked wonders for them in the past. now when i put it on them i still see some fleas on them (the fleas die when they bite your cat). and i still see them scratching a bit but not that much. so it has helped a lot but not 100%. it's better than nothing since Advantage made one of my cats have an allergic reaction to it.
1,FRONTLINE STOPPED WORKING,"We had two or three months of success with Frontline before it stopped working entirely and we go inundated with fleas during the peak of humid summer weather. We applied exactly as directed, gave it time, but because the fleas became resistant to the toxin or because it stopped killing them quickly enough to break the life cycle, we got a full infestation despite both of our cats being treated, and regular diligent vacuuming. They are indoor only, so it wasn't like they were bringing fleas in from outside. The company shrugged and said it just takes more time. Well when your product lets the fleas get a foothold I can't wait for it to start working again! We went with a different spot treatment and Fleabusters borax powder in the carpet and now not a single flea. Never ever going back to Frontline."
1,No Effect At All,"This is the second time I've bought Frontline from amazon. The first time it worked well, this time it didn't work at all. I'm pretty sure it didn't even kill a single flea. My poor cat is still scratching away, I'm out $40, and now have to look into other options. This is the last time I buy pet meds from amazon. I think I'll pay the extra money to get it from the vet."
1,Disappointed...,My cat is STILL scratching and we have found little fleas on him...this after 3 months of using this product. We are switching to another product. Sorry Frontline!
3,good price on amazon,I have been battling fleas this year and it seems like this flea med is taking a while to conquer the problem I have used this for a few months now and still a few fleas on both my cats. I know fleas are bad this year and my vet said I may just have to switch to a different product to combat the problem.
1,"No Longer Works, Different Formula perhaps","We used this brand for a while but over the summer it stopped working, in fact, the fleas seem to love it. Nothing has changed on our end and our cats are strictly indoors and do not come in contact with other animals.Perhaps this company has changed the formula ?"
3,IT OKAY,I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT MANY TIMES FOR MY INDOOR CAT AND IT WORKS QUITE WELL BUT NOT SO MUCH FOR MY OUTDOOR CATS
2,Didnt work,I had two indoor cats that somehow got fleas and this was my first experience using this type of product. It did not make a difference. Luckily I purchased Advantage Plus and it did the trick after 6 weeks of going crazy and spending a lot of money on products that didn't work.
2,Did not work...,"I bought this product because it was so highly recommended. It worked at first, then nothing...Very disappointed....and not pleased..won't use it again.."
2,still got ticks,"not real happy about his, cat still got ticks and they did not die, they got fatter, don't know if I like this , will try one more time and if it dont' work I am going to a different brand..."
2,Frontline plus,Somewhat disappointing as the product was not the usual prepackaged monthly doses but rather four months supply in one large plastic aluminum flat container that needed to be transferred into a glass viile. You then needed t o use a suringe to extract a given amount to then apply on the cat. Too many steps and potential for mishandling!
1,Counterfeit???,"I have used frontline for years and this is my first experience of it not working at all. I applied it and within three weeks, my cat started scratching I saw fleas and flea dirt. I reapplied a week and a half before I should have had to and still have the same problem.. I am going back to buying from the vet!"
1,Counterfeit or damaged??,"I have used Frontline Plus for many years. HOWEVER,this batch does NOT work. I do not know if this is a counterfeit batch or something happened to it, but the flea problem has gotten much worse -- not better. Very disappointed."
1,My Cat Had an Adverse Reaction to Frontline Plus,"Be careful with using these poisons on your pets. My healthy 6 year old Abyssinian cat had an adverse reaction to Frontline Plus within 3 hours of putting the medication on his skin. He had tremors, was lethargic, had trouble standing and walking, vomited several times, and had foul-smelling diarrhea. I washed the stuff off him immediately, but it took a few days for him to recover. Other pet owners haven't been as lucky and their pets have died. Frontline Plus is even recommended as being not as toxic as other meds. Be prepared to wash this off immediately at the first sign of an adverse reaction (Dawn dish detergent is recommended for its degreasing properties), and a make quick, expensive trip to the vet."
1,Didn't work,"I've purchase Frontline from a vet's office before and it has always worked. However, I purchased 2 kits from Amazon as the price was lower, and it did not work. I believe I received a bogus batch or imitation of the real Frontline. When I checked the packages, there was no expiration date to be found. I tried it on my cat(twice) and she is in misery (scratching, biting, trying to run away from the fleas..) as it does not kill the fleas. In otherwords, I've wasted my money. I now have to go back to the vet and purchase a dose so she can have some relief. Please be careful when you purchase this type of product from someone other than a vet or a pest control retail store."
3,frontline for cats,"cat still scratching, a little each day, hope it improves, will continue with dosage and keep my fingers crossed, Wife not hapy."
4,Flea meds,Have been using this medicine for a number of years. There have been no fleas or ticks on my pets. The price was the best I have found.
2,2 empty vials,"Very upset! 2 of the 6 vials of product were empty. I have searched extensively and cannot find a way to contact amazon about this product to get a price adjustment. Because it is ""toxic"" it cannot be returned. This is too expensive to be short 1/3 of the product!(I was finally able to figure out how to contact Amazon customer service - not an easy task! They are reimbursing me for 1/3 of the cost to compensate me for the problem. Thanks Amazon!)"
2,Did not work,"I'm giving this 2 stars just in case it was my application that was incorrect. Followed the directions to a tee and the product seemed to work for the first week or so. Fleas were jumping off my cats instead of onto them. 3 weeks after application and I'm still dealing with fleas, and more than ever. I understand you must be vigilant in keeping the house clean, but I think 3 thorough vacuumings killed more fleas than this product.I was warned not to purchase from unlicensed providers. Merial (the manufacturer) does NOT sell to online companies. I believe the product may have been counterfeit. I will turn to my veterinarian. Amazon is a good deal for most products, but be very careful with Frontline if you do decide to purchase online."
1,Failed to work.,"Have used this in the past, and it was fantastic then. This time it did not work whatosever. Was extremely disappointed. Package arrived quickly and was satisfied with the shipping time."
1,empty containers,We just realized that one of the packets is empty and that there are varying amounts of the medicine in the othger packets. Can you please let us know if you can send us another box of this frintline for cats?Lot#f41751
5,Repels ticks and kills them,Our one cat ALWAYS gets ticks in the summer and it is sooo yukky!! We even found a tick that had fallen off and was dying!!It is really comforting to know when he comes home from his walks he is not carrying ticks home. Great product!
5,Fleas die,This product is simply the best. I've used it several times and it gets rid of fleas fast. Enough said.
1,This did not work,I spent alot of money on this flea treatment for my cats and it did not work. I was very dissapointed and out alot of money. I did further research on this product and many sites stated that this product could not be shipped by air because it would jeopordize its affectiveness. Anyone who supplies this should make the buyer aware and only offer ground shipping.
1,Doesn't work on our cat,"We have a munchkin cat (cat with short legs). He's just a kitten, but this product did not work at all on him. I had to use Advantage which did work."
1,Flea for All!,"HORRIBLE, useless product. We have three indoor cats that we treated with this product. Here we are 2 weeks later and we now have about 10 times more fleas!!! We all, humans and cats alike, have tons of scabs from being bitten. We actually didn't have much of an issue before we treated them, but we knew this was the height of flea season so we thought better safe than sorry... How wrong we were! Now we're dealing with a massive worm outbreak as well. I'm not sure what they are doing wrong, but I'm going to ask for a refund."
5,Worked Great,"Purchased this after receiving recommendations from friends. It worked great. Easy to apply. Cat was really mad when I applied it, but seems to appreciate not having to scratch."
1,Not so great on multiple cat homes,"I found my 4 month-old kitten INFESTED with fleas after about 3 weeks of application!! The customer service rep from Frontline gave us a run-around telling us the eggs are still viable and they ""fell off"" and re-infested the cat. I'm sticking with old fashioned flea baths from now on: cheaper and much more effective."
5,Love this stuff,"Received it very quickly and of course, it definitely works. We have been using this on our cats for years. Highly recommended."
1,Frontline didn't work at all!,I used to use Advantage and have not had a flea problem for several years. I have two cats and got Frontline rather than Advantage this time and I'm sitting here with my kitty in my arms and fleas jumping on my hands. Didn't work a bit. I've just ordered Advantage. Wondering if I got the 'fake' Frontline people are talking about. Total waste of time and money.
5,It WORKS!!!!!,"Let's keep it simple - this product WORKS. No ""ifs"", no ""ands"", no ""buts"". Within 2 days - yes, folks - just 2 days - the nightmare was over. I'm going to faithfully use Frontline Plus for Cats every month. I'm a believer!!!It WORKS."
1,Do not waste your money,I wasted my money. I've used Frontline in the past and it has worked fine. This time the fleas thought it was dinner. They just multiplied. My poor cats were miserable. Had to wait 30 more days and spend another $70.00 on Advantage which is working much better.
5,good product,"this product does exactly what it says. after i put it on my 4 cats, i noticed a difference in how much they were scratching almost immediately. it does a good job."
1,Does this stuff work at all?,We have three adult indoor cats in Seattle in our small home. Recently one of our cats got outdoors and we ended up with fleas. We used this exact product and three weeks later we noticed nothing had changed. There where still fleas. So we applied the other dose and three weeks later we have seen a 0% decrease in flea popuation. This cost us 100$ and we do not make loads of money so to spend 100$ on a product that did NOTHING is quite a loss. I will never buy Frontline again in this lifetime.
5,Front Line Plus for Cats,This particular brand works quickly and with a multiple household kitty family it's so important. I begin with the first sign of fleas reapply diligently once a month until they are gone. It's the best I've found.
5,Works as advertised,Tried other products. This is the best. A bit expensive but found that Amazon has the lowest price available.
5,Convenient & powerful pet-owner's ally,"I've been using Frontline Plus for two generations of cats. It's easy to use and quick to apply to my pet. Best of all, it works. This product is the cat's meow."
2,Don't waste your money on this product!,"My cat is strictly an indoor cat only, but managed to get a few fleas. I noticed flea eggs on the blanket so I immediately gave him a flea bath, vacuumed & washed all bedding. I thought I would try Frontline bc they were selling it at Costco. DOES NOT WORK. Within 2-3 weeks, my cat is scratching and we noticed fleas again.Frontline does not work because it is obvious it does NOT repel fleas or kill them. I tried this product for SIX MONTHS and it failed me. Today, I purchashed Advantage II bc of all the rave reviews and people having the SAME complaints as me with Frontline. Within an hour after applying Advantage, I saw a flea on my cats face trying to jump ship!! Now that is fast!"
2,Didn't work at all!,I've used Frontline in the past and it has worked but this year we had an extremely warm winter and the fleas were awful. This product did not work at all. Instead use Bayer Advantage - it worked wonderfully.
1,Did not work for my Irish Setter,"I ordered this for all four of my dogs because the price was affordable and it's a good name. Tried the generic form and it killed the adult fleas, but that was about it. I appled the Frontline Plus and a week later, all the dogs were still itching and I found a few fleas on the three of them. On my Irish Setter there was alot of fleas and I even applied another dose two weeks later and I am still seeing a lot of fleas on him. Now he is getting the red bumps from a flea allergy. That means another trip to the vet and more expense for antibiotics. I should have stuck to the Advantix II like the vet told me."
2,Rarely works,Our fleas have grown immune to this stuff. Plus I never really liked putting this stuff on my cats. None of them liked it at all. They all ran away after applying this stuff. Try Little City Dogs product. It really works.
1,!!!DOES NOT WORK!!!,"The Frontline Plus was purchased with Amazon Prime's 2 day shipping. It has been 6 days, and there is no record of package tracking since the day it was ordered. I ordered flea treatment for my pets and since it now 4 days late, they are still scratching from their fleas and now I am too.Update:It was ordered on 12/3/12 and arrived the week of Christmas. On top of that, it does not work!!! All three cats are still scratching after 2 wks and now it is too late to return item. I still have 3 USELESS doses left and have to eat the $60 cost of the Frontline and buy another package locally. I am a VERY UNHAPPY customer."
5,Stopped all the scratching,The product exactly matched the description and stopped a flea infestation among 6 cats in its tracks! We have tried other flea products and this one is clearly the best on the market right now.
4,Good product,"Good product for a cheaper price than you can purchase other places. Cats (or at least mine) hate it, but it does actually work. My cat is an inside cat and only goes outside for limited amounts of time, but she's had fleas before and this med was a big help."
1,Didn't work,"Arrived timely, packaged well. Product did not have an expiration date, and did not work. I am familiar with frontline products, and expected to be pleased, but this did not help the fleas. I don't know if it was expired since there was no date, but from past experiences, I expected better. I would not purchase again this way."
1,Frontline? How about no line,"I have to say that doing nothing about my cat's flea problem would have done as much good as this product. In fact, none of the the flea meds I have tried worked."
2,Doesn't work,Bottomline it doesn't work. Bought it for $40 at a store. Fleas went away for a little while but came back after a couple of weeks. Now I have to repeat the whole process again including the expense. Revolution is the only one that seems to have real results.
1,Another worthless product,If you like flees then this is the product for you. Most likely a black market product from overseas. Does not work at all! A rip off!
2,Ineffective,"Makes my cat a little under the weather for a day, and the fleas may have jumped off for a day or two, but it didn't keep them from jumping back on her. Within days, she was being attacked again. It used to work for her, but maybe the fleas are immune or something... so the vet tells me..."
2,Why is this product made in France?,"I bought Frontline. In the meantime I read an article in my local newspaper that discussed buying pet medications online. The writer, a veterinarian, explained that many times pet medications offered via online vendors are not manufactured in the U.S., thus there are questions about their viability. I checked the label of what I had purchased and sure enough, it was manufactured in France. I would like Amazon to address the issue of why products like Frontline, which are American in origin, are being supplied from another country. I suppose the simple answer is that they're cheaper -- but are they effective? According to the above-mentioned article, the pharmaceutical company in question does not guarantee the product unless it's supplied through a veterinarian. Next time I will purchase through my vet."
1,Invest in the competition instead,"Advantage (Bayer) is MUCH better that Frontline. Frontline worked for the first week, then the fleas came back. By week three my cats were infested, with one week to go for their next treatments. Horrible product. Advantage (the one made by Bayer), has cleared up 98% of the fleas my cats had in just two months, where Frontline couldn't keep them flea free in the 6 months I used the product."
1,How to use frontline for cats,Take $70 out of your wallet. Light it on fire. Go buy advantage. Frontline is utterly worthless. I have a 20lb indoor cat who has been plagued by fleas this winter. I won't go into the ordeal I have gone through for the past 3 months. But in short- I followed their directions in case of re-infestation and ended up using 6 month supply in half the time. Not only did this cheat me out of a refund but made my poor cat suffer. I would give it a Zero if I could.
4,Cat protection,Ordered 4/26/09 received 5/2/09. Applied to our cat and so far it is working very well. Our cat doesn't seen to notice that we used this product on her.
3,"Good Product, Rotten Price.","Frontline Plus is a fine product; keeps our outdoor kitty pretty much flea free. The price $101.95 quoted on Amazon for a 6-pak of dispensers, is more than 2x what i paid (from a US source). I used a simple Google search by product name, and a careful checking of product descriptions and prices.I paid $48-49 incl s&h;, for the same product."
1,Questionable quality,I've purchased Frontline from my vet in the past & it worked perfectly. My cats were flea-free for the entire month. I decided to save a little $ by purchasing it on Amazon. It didn't help at all. I may as well have just donated the $ to charity instead of wasted paper & packaging on this purchase. I'm not sure if the product was expired since there was not date on the packaging. I'll continue to purchase Frontline through my vet.
1,I Don't Understand!,"I don't understand what happened. I put a dose each on five cats. It worked for three days, then stopped. My son recommened Front Line to me. It is supposed to work 100% for 30 days. Did I get a bootlegged item? What's going on? I'll give it one star because it worked 100% for those three days. It bothers me, I had to wait 30 days in between treatments, watching fleas crawl all over them and the poor cats miserably biting and scratching. Ewwwww!"
3,"Ok, but not great.","It did have some effects, but not significant. We are planning to use other products."
1,Your mileage may vary,"Didn't last a month as advertised. I applied it per the instructions, and the fleas were back within 15 days.Time to give advantage a try..."
1,Empty applicators,"I wasn't able to even use the product. By the time I tried to, I discovered that each of the applicators were empty. The packaging is covered in oily residue and smells of nasty chemicals. Unfortunately, I have only just discovered this and I purchased the treatments in August, 2012. Suppose I am out of luck in regards to both treating my poor cat, or getting a refund for this rather expensive product."
4,payment too slow to post to my checking account,"I got this product for an important purpose, flea control, and with my budget its one of the most expensive things I incorporate into my budget. as a result it is very important that payments come out right away. Its been 3 days since I made this purchase and nothing has posted to my account. I am pretty sure I used the wrong billing address, and there is no warning or email, or any notification to suggest that I may have used the wrong billing zip code. So now, not only is there no sign of the $73 coming out of my account, but I cant even cancel it to avoid being over drawn, in the chance that the payment goes through, even though I believe these kinds of things wont with the wrong billing address.Thats all, wish there was more clarity in this online shopping deparment.-Elijah"
5,Same Product - Great Price!,Saw the previous comment so not sure if it was an isolated case but I've been purchasing this from Amazon for quite some time and it's been working as advertised! No fleas on both my cats...and without the high price many vets charge.
1,"This product was the UK ""equivalent"" and DID NOT WORK",My cat is still bringing in fleas. She has been treated 3 times with this UK equivalent that says that it is the same. BUT IT IS NOT!!She has had 3 months of fleas. We've been to the vet. She still has them. I'm now buying a new kind from a different seller and hoping for a better result!
1,Vials were empty!!!!!!!,Be warned: We just opened a box of six doses and all were empty or near empty. Lot No. F41751. Will never order this item online again.
5,Exactly the same as what we get from the vet,"This product came in an unopened package and is the same exact product that we used to purchase from the vet. Worked just fine on the cat. Purchasing this product on Amazon saved about $15.00. Thank you, Amazon!"
1,Not so much...,"We tried this over Advantage,and I honestly cannot tell if it works.We have two indoor cats and one clipped feral outside.Maybe we have super fleas,but right now it's a nightmare.It just didn't work for us.(Central Florida)"
1,Wonderful Product -- Terrible Containers -- No Returns -- Buy Locally!,"We only use FrontlinePlus and used to only buy at Amazon.The last package of six contained three empty containers! The three with medicine did not have scored necks which would open when folded... Very necessary to deliver the medicine with one hand.They can not be returned to Amazon, so we have been burned by Merial's terrible quality control.Now I'll buy at COSTCO and check the packaging in their store."
1,Waste of Money,"This product did not work. It did not kill the fleas fast enough to prevent the life cycle. I applied the Frontline Plus to my cats as soon as I noticed one flea in my house. 3 weeks later, I was dealing with a full blown infestation. When I contacted my vet, she said Frontline is a waste of money. It takes up to 24 hours to kill the flea which does not prevent them from laying eggs. And the longer the product is on the cats, the less effective it is. So by week 2 it may take up to 48 hours for the flea to die. My vet highly recommended Advantage, which kills the fleas within 5 minutes of biting the cat. I applied the Advantage and 2 days later, not one flea in site. AMAZING. Do not waste your money on Frontline... buy Advantage, your cats will thank you."
1,defective or knock off?,"Just opened one vial of Frontline Plus for cats we purchased through Amazon. I immediately noticed it smelled wrong. We have used Frontline for our dogs and cats for many years, so I am very familiar with it. Upon further investigation, I noticed one sealed vial in the package was completely empty and all of the rest had uneven amounts of liquid in the vials. Not sure if this is a defective batch or some knockoff product. I called customer service and was able to get a refund even though it is not returnable(hazardous material). VERY disappointed in this product and I hope Amazon immediately checks and verifies the quality of their remaining inventory."
1,Suspicious quality,"I've always found Frontline to work very well, but this particular pack had some of the tubes already loose from the blister pack, and one one of the tubes', it appeared that there was no fluid in it at all.We tried this over three months on two cats, and did not even see so much as a sick flea - we saw no reduction in fleas at all.We just ordered Advantage II - it was packaged perfectly and within less than a day we are finding dead and dying fleas.With the success we have previously had with Frontline, I am just suspicious about the authenticity of the item we received.I will be ordering directly from reputable suppliers only from now on."
2,large cats,This product worked on my average to small cats but it did not work on my large thirty pound cat. If you have a large cat then The product that splits dosage according to wieght works better
2,Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens,"I purchased a 3 month supply of Frontline for Kittens & Cats for my son's cat. After completing all three doses on a monthly basis, his cat still had fleas. I called the Merial Customer Service Department, directly, and was told ""they only recommend purchasing their product directly from veterinarian's"". Enough said."
2,no as effective as I hoped,"I used this products on my cats. At first, the flea number declined. But in just a few days they came back. I also use the Frontline spray on all carpet and bedding. It might also be too irritating for cats. One of my cat throw up three times after applying. Not recommend."
1,What has happened to Frontline? It doesn't work anymore.,"Used Frontline years ago and it was wonderful. With only one application, all fleas were gone and the cats were happy. This is the second time in more than 15 years that my cats have had fleas. I purchased Frontline again, expecting to get the same wonderful, immediate results.What a huge disappointment!!! My cats continue to suffer with fleas. I'm very frustrated and the cats are miserable."
3,Some improvements.,"I was hoping for a full satisfaction. 10 days after applying the product, I still had to comb my cat to help him get rid of fleas.After a month, it is better, but he is not 100 % free of fleas. New application today so we will see."
1,Complete waste of money,"Treated my cat with Frontline Plus a week and a half ago, and he's been scratching for the last two days. Checked him today and he has fleas on him. The entire house has been treated with diatomaceous earth and none of my family members are being bit anymore....just my cat. WHO HAS A FLEA PREVENTION PRODUCT ON HIS BODY. Definitely not impressed whatsoever. Disgusted is more like it. Just for once I'd like a product to do what it says it will."
1,Not the same Frontline Plus you get from a vet.,"I ordered Frontline Plus with the asumption that it is the same as you get from a vet. Less than two weeks after applying it my cats had fleas again, I called the vet to see it I could put more on them and they said I couldn't until it had been a full month. Now I have to deal with fleas for two more weeks. My vet told me that the Frontline plus I received was made in Canada and the strengths are different, so this is not a bargain it is a waste of money. I learned a $60.00 lesson."
2,Illegally selling product,"This seller advertises in word and by photo that she is selling ""Frontline Plus."" The product shipped was ""Frontline Combo"" manufactured in the United Kingdom. Although the active ingredients are the same, it is illegal to sell this in the USA. In addition to this problem, she told me she sent it on 07/22. Based on the shipping label, she must have forgotten to mail it. After contacting her as to why it had not been received yet, she said she would ""resend"" it. If this actually had been resent, then why does the shipping label have the date of 07/22/2011 on it? I ordered from this person because she had a 98% satisfaction rate. Guess in the future I will note that a rating may not show that the seller is doing something legal and that I must be careful."
2,Frontline Plus outdated?,Frontline Plus arrived with no expiration date stamped on box. Hmmm. Always has expiration date. Guess what? Product does not seem to be working. Guess that would be my only clue as to whether or not the purchased goods were outdated.
1,EXPIRED-PACKAGE DATED 2011,"I have always used this product in the past, but noticed that this time my cats were still scratching and still had fleas. I noticed that the liquid in the dispensers were not as full and it did not have a strong smell as before. When I looked at the box, it was dated 2011. I ordered November 2012."
1,Totally ineffective,"This is the second year I've tried Frontline for my two cats. I should have learned from experience, but hope springs eternal. This expensive product had no effect at all on the cats' flea problem. None. This appears to be a growing problem; perhaps the fleas have developed immunity to the chemical in this medication. Will not be buying Frontline again, until I hear that it has been improved."
1,don't buy,When I got home today I found large clumps of cat hair all over the carpet. She ripped out all her hair where I applied it between her shoulders leaving a bare bloody spot the size of a quarter.
1,Missing Doses,Three of the doses were not full. I also wonder about the quality of the other doses. We noticed a difference between the product received through Amazon and the one that we received from out Vet. So much for trying to save money.
1,Flea Resistance,"Frontline Plus no longer works for flea control because fleas have become resistant to this product and you may be able to get your money back directly from the manufacturer of this product. So, do not waste your money."
1,No longer a reliable product,"When I first opened my pet grooming salon nearly 10 years ago, I would recommend Frontline over every other product. It was the most effective back then. These days; however, over the last year and a half, I have seen countless dogs and cats whose owners I know with certainty correctly use the product and have found their pets infested with fleas and live attached ticks. Pretty much since they released the Frontline Plus, I've seen a decline in its effectiveness and many customers' in distress. And I'm hearing the same complaints from a couple of local veterinarians. I now steer my customers away from Frontline and continue to seek a safe and effective alternative. Let you know when I do."
3,"Good product, bad packaging","I bought this because it was such a good deal. Unfortunately, now that it's been a few months and I've used more, I found that TWO of the vials were empty. Hopefully just a rare packaging error. I will buy again and hope for better luck."
1,DOESN'T WORK ANY MORE!,"If you have purchased any Frontline product in the last year you already know what I'm talking about. I bought some for my cat a few months ago and I might as well of sprinkled her with water. After a couple of days..she exploded with fleas. I went to my Vet and he said that Frontline doesn't work anymore...the company is apparently cutting costs. My daughter bought some for her dogs and had the exact same experience. It used to be a great product, not anymore, don't waste your money."
1,Frontline Plus for Cats,Bought this in hopes of controling fleas & ticks but my cat still got ticks. I've been lucky enough to find & detach them before they became engorged. She also seemed to be sensitive to the stuff or else she had fleas I could not detect with her hair being so long and thick.I WILL NOT recommend any Frontline product to my friends or aquaintances.
4,Review of Frontline for Cats,"This was my first use of this product. Purchased from Amazon.com since the price was way competitive with other sources (even our local SPCA). I have two cats and one in particular spends time outside patrolling his kingdom. He is a neutered cat and attracts many, many fleas. His problem was VERY SERIOUS, but Frontline brought the problem under control within a short period. I use a flea comb on both cats so I was able to see firsthand the before and after difference. I was impressed, and if my cats could speak, they would say so too! Although there are still fleas, I believe if I am consistent the flea count is under control. Not eliminated, but under control. Thanks for a great product!!"
3,Not as effective,My 1st time to use Frontline and found that my pet still had a few fleas. I had used Advantage II before and knew it did the trick. I thought they would be close to the same results...not. I will go back to my original order from now own.
3,Works But Not For Long..,I have five outdoor cats and it seems like it works sometimes and when it does is for 3 weeks exactly. I'm going to try Bayer Advantage to see how that works out for me...
1,House full of fleas,"I have been using this product consistently and a week ago found my house to be full of fleas! I am now trying EVERYTHING to get rid of these terrible bugs, treating house, yard and cat. I am so disappointed in this product!"
2,not worth it,I have tried this product a couple of times on my 2 cats and it doesn't work very well. They both still have fleas. Save your money.
3,Does Not Work For Ticks,"I bought this looking for a solution to my tick problem on my cat. We use Advantage II during the winter, but since summer hit we needed a tick product. I went with this because it is supposed to be the best. Well, it is not. After 3wks. my cat still comes in with ticks all over her! I took her to the vet to get spayed and when they shaved her stomach they said she was covered with ticks. Looking for another product. This seller was very nice and nothing against them at all. Works good for fleas by the way."
1,Worthless,"Didn't do a thing.... Still covered in fleas. Would not recommend this product to anyone. Waste of my money, and still have to wait a month to try something else."
2,She's still miserable,"Used this product as directed all three doses, and three months later my eight year old indoor cat still has fleas. Twelve hours after the first treatment the fleas started falling off dying. It didn't kill em all. After vacuming (daily) using sprays, powders and two additional doses she still has fleas. She is now losing hair due to a flea allergy, and I'm stuck waiting for this last treatment to be finished so I can buy some Advantage. Maybe that will work better, right now its hard to watch her try to bite them back."
2,not so great,"Needless to say I jumped at the chance to have it delivered to me rather than slogging off to a vet to get it, but found right away that it was either old or ineffective, and the packaging was impossible. Won't buy Frontline again."
5,Amazing,My kitten had a horrible flea infestation when I found him. I was so worried they were going to suck the life right out of him. I looked everywhere for a cheap flea medicine and when I found this product I was shocked how cheap it was. They had super fast delievery and I couldnt be more happy. My baby is all better now and hes more lovey than ever without all those fleas on him. This is a great product!
1,Disappointing!,"Our cat picked up fleas from a visit to the in-laws over Christmas. We ordered Frontline as an inexpensive solution but it didn't work. Had to spend the extra dough and order Advantage instead, which did work."
1,"Ordered, said in stock, didn't ship...","I thought I'd order from here since it was a few dollars cheaper than going to a local store (shipping being free made it less). I ordered it on the 19th, according to the site it is in stock. I cancelled it on the 23rd, apparently it wasn't going to ship until the 26th...what?? If the item is in stock then why the long wait to have it shipped? Gah! I'll just go to the store and pay the few dollars extra to save my sanity...I'd expect a longer wait on something not in stock, not on something that is in stock. Oh and when I had it *bought* it was a dollar less than the price it's currently listed at. Strange."
5,the best,This is the best flea and tick product out there. I just wish it would prevent the ticks from hitch-hiking too.
4,Seems to do what it says,"This product seems to do what it says, but I might try another product that actually repels fleas/ticks instead of just killing them. I recently found a tick on one of my cats that had evidently been there for at least a few days. The tick appeared to be dead, but again, it had already been on my cat for a few days. I'd rather have a product that not only kills, but repels."
5,Good price compaired to a pet store sale price,I just paid $45 for 3 treatments kit at Petsmart (on sale).This is a good price.
3,Does not work for a month,"The product works well for a week or two, but not longer. It seemed to work better a couple of years ago, so I wonder if fleas are building a resistance to it. I suspect that's why it's gotten cheaper as well."
1,Not working!,"I have been using frontline plus for about 3, 4 years and is not working anymore!I have two outside cats, and I applied frontline regularly and never had a problem with fleas before. But everything changed this spring 2012. Cats keep scratching, fleas not gone, a nightmare! I have spread borax on my house, what looks like is working, and washing my cats with a flea/tick shampoo. I've been reading on line reviews that Merial customer service sucks, that fleas are building resistance of the product, or that after a couple of years the product doenst work anymore. I will try to get my money back from Merial, cause in the past 3 months I've spent more than hundreds with a product that doenst work.Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens, 6 Doses"
1,Worked before - not this time though,"I have used Frontline on my cat before and it worked just fine. This time, either the fleas in my area are becoming immune to the formula -- or this product is not what it claims to be. Either way, Frontline has not gotten rid of my cat's fleas. I even used Capstar to kill the adult fleas before applying Frontline (and Capstar worked like a charm- they all just fell off!).Novartis Capstar Flea Treatment Blue Tabs for Dogs and Cats,nitenpyram, 6 tablets, 2-25lbsBefore buying this product online, I suggest two things:1) Poke around on the internet/call some local vets to see if others are having issues with Frontline in your community. Perhaps there's some truth to this Frontline flea-immunity tale.2) Check to see your vet's pricing on the product. I went with Amazon because it was a bit cheaper. Now, I'm having to go to the vet to buy Advantage or Revolution."
1,CAUTION!! DO NOT USE THIS ITEM!!,This product arrived today and it has a horrible odor!! The smell has given us all headaches!! I have been using topical products for years and never experienced a problem such as this.
1,Bald Spot from Frontline,"This product caused my cat to develop a bald spot at the application site. There was no warning on the box about this potential side effect. We used Revolution before, and the cat was fine."
3,Frontline,It has not worked as well this year as previous years. May have to switch to something else. Price was good and service was awesome though!
1,No Good!,"This stuff DOES NOT WORK!It worked okay for the first few years I used it but last year didn't work so well and this year didn't work at ALL. I had to switch to Advantage, which is far superior and if I remember correctly was a few dollars less.If I could have rated it no stars I would have."
2,Sad But True,Used to be the best. Apparently fleas have developed immunity to it. Went with Advantage instead after we still had issues while using Frontline.
1,Not in expected packaging,"I expected the box pictured with the factory sealed type containers I normally order, but recieved a zip lock bag with syringe type applicators. I have not actually used yet."
1,Buyer Beware,"I just recently purchased a 6 month supply of Frontline for my Cat because she has a flea problem. I purchased the 6 month supply because i had purchased Frontline before and to my knowledge it had worked. Well not this time, i did apply it correctly, however this time it did nothing at all to kill the fleas on my Kitty. Now I'm stuck with the remainder of the package and really wish i could just get my money back. Advantage however, has always worked properly and i have never had a problem with it, but since Amazon had Frontline with free shipping, i went that route trying to save some money. Big mistake! Just wanted to warn people, if you have never tried frontline before, buy a single dose first and see if it's going to work for you so your not out a lot of money if it doesn't."
5,works,i love this my cats are sleeping with out waking up and not scratching thank you amazon charlotte jones
3,Frontline to the rescue?,My cat and I are still in month one of using Frontline and there's some scratching going on. I'd like to know if it's something that has to build over time or if it isn't as good as people say it is.
4,No more fleas,"I've used this product before and I'll use it again. It took care of my flea problem in one treatment, but keep up with it, because within 4 weeks, you'll need it again. DO NOT buy a product off the shelf at your local department store. Your cats life is at stake. Once I mistakenly used the dogs flea meds on my cat and almost lost her. Another time I used a store bought flea med (Hartz) on a kitten that was age appropropriate and I almost lost her too. Used once a month, this (Frontline) product will do as it says, no more fleas!"
2,product has quit working on my cat,I've used Frontline for years but this batch did not work on my cat. It must be a bad batch or the formula has changed. I called the customer service hotline and they told me I couldn't get a refund because I didn't have receipts that proved I had been using the product continuously for 90 days. I was told to keep using it for 2 more months while my house fills up with fleas. I've used it on my cat for years with small breaks over the winter but they would not believe me. Amazon backed the product and gave me a refund. I'll never buy Frontline or any other product from the company again.
2,Not The Best,It might have lasted a couple weeks. Would not recomend for anything but an older kitten. I won't be buying this one again.
2,Was not happy this time.,"So I have been using Frontline plus for years. Never had an problem with it until this last time. It hasn't been getting the job done. Should I move on to Advantage? I heard fleas become immune to flea treatments if used for months, years, and that pet owners should switch the products."
1,DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE - NO STARS,Been using FL for yrs and have had no trouble w/fleas. The last two applications have not worked. I even wondered if they were just filling those little vials w/water. Something is wrong and I definitely want my money back.
2,Worked for one week,"I have two cats that are strictly indoor cats. They obtained fleas perhaps by being tracked into our house so I ordered Frontline from this seller. It worked for about a week and now the fleas are definitely alive and thriving on both of our cats, and for safety we can't apply anything else for 3 more weeks. I wouldn't recommend buying this product to anyone."
1,one star is way TOO MUCH!!!,"This product is totally shit. DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON IT. I applied the product to my cat(never go outside) 2 weeks ago but my cat got even more fleas. So I again applied it one week ago and until today, my cat still has fleas. There is no sign of any dead fleas.I am totally mad now"
4,Battle Ready,"Fight, fight, fight - fleas that is. Frontline Plus has been my armor bearer in this fight for many, many years. Fleas are more resistant than ever, but it still does a really good job if used consistently."
2,Flea Flop,"Promises, promises. This stuff just flat-out doesn't work, despite all the hype. Fleas and ticks continued to infest my cat. I switched to Hartz Pro, and for pennies on the dollar, my cat is now free of the nasty bugs."
1,Did not work.,"DO NOT BUY Frontline Plus. It does not work!!!!!!!I applied the Frontline Plus to all four of my cats, because one of them got out and brought fleas back in and spread them to all the cats. The stuff reduced the number of fleas, but all four cats after a week still have fleas. I combed them all after a week to let it have time to kill everything. I got live fleas off all the cats. Two only had a few each, one had about 12, the other had over 20 living fleas. The first few days, I saw dying fleas coming off the cats, but the ones I combed off were not dying, and weren't even slowed down.Mind you I also vacuumed every day and treated the carpets, bedding, and anything they lay on. It was not just picking up live fleas from the surroundings, the stuff just does not work. This is actually the second month I've tried it, because I thought maybe I didn't apply it right the first month. In the first round, it didn't kill all the fleas either."
2,Didn't work,"Well I have had to buy advantage because Frontline for some reason is not working this season. So I am very disappointed with the product. However, the company did ship it fast and on time. It just seems Frontline has weakened their formula so you have to buy more of it!"
2,A total failure for fleas in NC,"I used this product, as directed, for seven straight months with ZERO flea results. For five cats, that is a significant cost. I read several people's reviews that in NC and SC, perhaps this product does not work - it sure didn't in my case. I switched this month to Advantage, out of total desperation, the fleas were eating my poor cats up, I would comb one and get 8 fleas a day. I spray the house with Precor, great stuff, but every day the cats brought more fleas in.Advantage killed all the fleas on all five cats in one day. Period. I will give Frontline 2 stars for tick control, which it does well. I cannot find a way to contact Merial to tell my story to, which aggravates me, considering the cost, but I will use Advantage and try to find something for ticks next season."
1,notsomuch,"i ordered frontline plus nov 8 after discovering some fleas on my 2 cats...product did not arrive until nov 23...i immediately treated both animals & 2 days later, discovered 1st tick EVER on 1 kitty & fleas still evident on both...i have used frontline successfully in the past & am wondering if i got a bad batch...i'll be contacting merial during business hrs 2 find out my recourse...very disappointed & now still have 2 figure out how to treat problem...this product is expensive & supposed to be the best...wth??"
3,Works fine for 5 out of 6 of my cats,"This product does work like it is supposed to... however, one out of 6 of my cats had a horrible allergic reaction to it. So I not longer can use this product in my home. Over the course of one day it burned her skin and made he fur fall out. Not to mention she constantly is licking, biting, and scratching herself because of it. Since my cat had never had fleas before, my vet said it would be ok to try this, knowing my cat had allergies to other things.... Well, that was the worse thing I could ever possibly do to her. She is in so much agony, and it's been a month and it's finally starting to ware off (thank god) Her fur is just now starting to grow back, and I had to buy a special shampoo to help the wounds heal....I gave this 3 stars because it did work on my other 5 cats... If you cat does not have allergies then this is ok to use on them. Never put this product on a cat with allergies. My poor little thing suffered horribly :("
3,So far Dissappointed,"We bought this item with high hopes it would cure our two mature cats of their fleas. 12 days in fleas still a problem, and so we are wondering how long it will take to work. Hate seeing our ""babies"" so uncomfertable. Hoping for the best!"
1,Counterfeit!,"Pretty sure this was counterfeit. It never worked for us. Our cat battled fleas and ticks all summer - we kept reapplying, it made no difference. Be warned. I am sure this is not the real stuff!"
1,Not happy,Not satisfied with this product. The cats have fleas and ticks after applying Frontline Plus. It does not work for 30 days as advertised.
3,"Effective, but irritated cat's skin","Frontlline Plus works well for what it is intended. No fleas, no ticks, cat stopped scratching and pulling out his fur in his tail. I suspect he may have had skin mites-he is mostly outdoors- and the Frontline seemed to quell this problem.My only complaint is the Frontline caused skin irritation between my cat's shoulder blades. This caused him to itch a lot. A bit of Benedryl cream eased his discomfort and everything healed just fine.I would recommend this product."
4,Frontline Plus for Cats,"This product really works, it got rid of all my Cat's flea's but unfortunately a few have come back after using the first dose. I have had to use the second dose before the time period was up! Also it took 2 weeks to arrive & my pussy cat was fed up & not happy having to wait for his medication."
5,Only product that really works,"My cat is allergic to fleas (as many cats are) and when the flea bites get bad, he gets bumps and red scabs all over. I never knew until the vet told me that many cats are allergic to fleas. Anyway, my fiancee bought a copycat product from the pet store, and I knew it wouldn't work. After nearly a week, his self-inflicted wounds are getting worse. This is the only product that works :)"
3,Is not lasting a whole month,My cats seems to be getting fleas again after a couple of weeks. Not as effective as I would have hoped for
4,Frontline for Cats,Vet suggested flea/tick meds since our pets (2) roam outside during the day. While they stay in yard Vet suggested they are still exposed. We've been very happy with Frontline. It is working as advertised. Will continue to use and buy again.
1,Fake??,"I usually buy this product at the vet, but decided to buy on line to save a few bucks. Well, it worked, for a week or two, but it is supposed to protect for much longer and break the life cycle of the fleas. Within the month, I found myself buying a different brand from a more reputable seller (still on line because I'm a sucker for a ""good deal""). I did a little on line research and apparently it is quite common to end up with imposter frontline when ordering on line -as it's supposed to only be sold by vets. I am now pretty skeptical about whether or not I really used Frontline, or a fancy fake..."
3,Not as expected,"This product claims to kill ""up to"" 100 percent of fleas within the first 24 hrs. I used it on my cats 3 days ago but the fleas are just as there now ad they were 3 days ago"
5,This stuff is awesome,"Easy to apply, and doesn't leave a big greasy spot on your pet after it dries. I have been using this product for years now, and I am very satisfied with the results."
1,"Leaking packets, no refund--Beware this company!","One of the six packets was cracked open and the medicine had leaked out. I wrote the company and asked for a replacement. ""Alex"" wrote me a letter saying I had to call him. I did, and he said their policy required proof of purchase (like the leaky packet I sent to them wasn't proof enough). He refused to replace the defective item unless I could find my receipt. When you order as much as I do from Amazon, that's a lot of receipts to go through over a two-month period. I guess Merial would rather lose a customer for life (my two cat are two-years-old and will need flea protection for MANY years) than do the right thing. This will be my LAST purchase of Frontline. Caveat emptor!"
1,It didn't work this time.,"For the first time-ever- this product did not work on my cats. I administered the liquid to each cat and all 4 cats still have fleas and eggs. I spent about $70 for 6 doses, for nothing! Not happy and really can't understand why it didn't work this time. Now I have to buy a different flea control medicine and this stuff is not cheap. I will not buy again."
3,Works good but could last longer (not a full month as advertised),"But does not last a full month. I had to start putting it on a flea sensitive cat every 3 weeks. This was advised by my vet who said that in NC at least, they were seeing the need to use a flea pill to kill all of the fleas combined with the flea drops."
3,this will not work alone,"our siemese kitten Lilly had fleas when we picked her up from a clist ad. We do not have fleas in our apartment however after using this product as directed she was not cured/rid of fleas. Most died or or ""jumped ship"" and died or lived in an area rug or curtains who knows but one or two remained on her.I recommend using this product in conjunction with flea powder to powder drapes, rugs etc. and/or flea shampoo to give the kitten a final once over after the frontline has cleared out.up to this day lilly is live and well the frontline seems to be good quality no withdrawls or mood changes or diet she is the same ol lilly bear and is happy but still has fleas so our search for her cure contines."
1,disappointment,product i received was not what i ordered. no where did i see that i was going to receive different product--reviews in past from others all say same thing---they should not be able to put a picture of one product up but send you something completely different--this needs to be stopped
3,Okay...,Product is what it is. Definitely a great price but I'm going back to Advantage. Frontline comes with a bad applicator and therefore is difficult to get on the skin of our cats. Advantage seems to work the same if not better and the applicator gives you much more control so you can apply ALL the contents on the skin of the cat.
2,"It works, but PLEASE be careful!","I used this product on my cat for years--since his kittenhood, and he's now eight.I never had a problem until recently. It appears now when I use Frontline that he has an allergic reaction to it; a silver-dollar sized chemical burn appears within hours of application, and within a day he has a bald spot to accompany it.He is now enduring twice-daily hydrocortisone treatments and a sweater vest made from an old sock. (Have you ever tried to put a 16 lb cat in a sock? I caution you; it is an exercise in patience and dexterity.)"
1,Frontline Plus does not work,"Yet another customer here saying Frontline Plus is not killing fleas anymore. I could not find an expiration date on the box. It is very annoying in the midst of criticizing a product when others perk up and say, ""Well it always works for me."" Yes it worked for me as well for a couple of years. Wait until it does not work for you! You have to wait 3 weeks in order to apply something else to your cats. Most likely due to a scorching summer this year, the fleas came on rapidly. Now I have a full blow infestation. After moving cross country one of my cats is evidently allergic to fleas now. He is almost hairless. It is miserable here in my house. Beware of Frontline because it can happen to you TOO! I will NEVER buy Frontline again. BTW it is not a knock off and was purchased in a high end establishment. If someone from Frontline wants to contact me. Do not unless you are going to send someone over to remove every flea from my house. Your product refund is a joke."
1,Burn on my cat from Frontline,My cat lost fur and has such irritated skin that it's bleeding. I'm following the previous advice and using hydrocortizone cream. Never buying this product again.
2,"Didn't work, but Advantage did..","I used Frontline twice to no avail. It killed the fleas on her for a couple days, and then they were back, permanently on her, as powerful as ever. I finally used Advantage and finally there were tons of big, dead fleas everywhere. Eggs can hatch new fleas in your carpets and apolstery for up to a year, which is why you will keep seeing fleas reappear from time to time. What matters is what happens to them after they hatch and jump back on. With Frontline, they stayed, and with Advantage, they kept dying every time a new batch got to her. I also liked the applicator better than Frontline. Frontline seems to work for a lot of people, but many others have had the same situation as me. Who knows. But I'll be sticking to Advantage for now."
2,Save your money,"I used this product exactly as indicated. I see absolutely no indication (and it has been almost a week)that this product works. Looks like I am back to the ""drawing board"". I gave this product two stars. Iwas being generous and nice."
1,Hair Remover!,"This stuff has left a permanent bald spot on my cat's neck! I'm done with man-made pet meds.I understand Diatomaceous dirt will kill fleas ""mechanically"" so they can never adjust to it. I'm going with that. No poisons for my kids to touch, no bald spots, no hard to open packaging."
3,"Seller got item here quickly, but...","The product arrived pretty quickly after I had ordered it, so the seller did a great job from their end. My only problems is with the actual product. My cat has flea dermatitis and even with Frontline we still have to use allergy pills, steroids and occasionally the cone to keep him from licking the skin off his back. I still haven't found something that will keep the fleas off enough that we don't get inflammation."
1,Do not buy Frontline from Amazon!,"I bought this from Amazon a month ago because it was cheaper than from the vet and found out later that Frontline will not stand behind their product unless it is purchased at a vet. Either the product I bought is a knock-off packaged as Frontline, or it just doesn't work. My cats still have fleas after the second monthly treatment and after 2 Capstar treatments. I have also tried to treat my home. It is not worth the money saved if the product doesn't work."
5,The real stuff!,The same Frontline for my cat as I get from my vet - just cheaper. Arrived quickly. Great way to get it.
1,Damaged box,Outer packaging was fine but box that was sent was damaged and one of the vials had leaked... I got one less than what i had paid for as a result.
2,Product did not work,"My cats are suffering from bad case of flea infestation and so I ordered this product after trying several others, however this product did not work and I still find fleas on them. This product cost lot more than most products available in the market and so I was hoping to see better results.Very disappointed in the product but have no complaints about the vendor as it arrived in reasonable time."
1,Is there a recall on this product?,"I have two cats, one female weighing an average of 10 lbs and the other, a male, weighs at about 20 lbs. I used this product on both of them at the same time last month and both of my cats still have fleas even more so than before. This product has failed to work so much so that I have gone back to see if maybe I received an expired product by mistake but have not found an expiration date on the box. Next, I'm contacting the manufacturer to see if maybe there is a recall on the product. As it is, I would not reccommend this product to anyone and, in fact, I am advising fellow pet owners to not use this FrontLine."
1,PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK,"I use to buy the same product at another pet store and it always worked very well in my cat but, at this time i thing something is very wrong. it just doesn't work. perhaps its not an original product. i don't know.will never again buy this product from amazon.com"
1,Don't waste your money,"This product used to work, but this go around was useless on six cats. Even treated the house, and the cats are still scratching away. Not sure what the problem is with this product now. If I'm going to spend money on a flea product, I want it to work, and this stiff is not that cheap. Sometimes you DO get what you pay for. I will be going back to purchasing Revolution at my vets. I would rather spend more money for a better quality product."
1,Counterfeit?,"The product received simply failed to work. I have used Frontline before with great success. This time, it sure seems likes I must have purchased a counterfeit."
1,Terrible Product - Leaked all over box.,"Purchased this for use on my 3 cats. When I opened it, found that it had leaked all over the box, rendering my expensive purchase useless.Here's the kicker Amazon won't accept returns on this product, because it's classified as hazardous material. And Frontline won't refund or replace it, because it wasn't purchased through a Veterinarian.The funny thing is, my wife is a vet. We bought it before a vacation, because her clinic was out of stock. But she told me pets are starting to develop Frontline resistance for fleas anyway, so she'll be recommending competing products (Advantage or Comfortis) to her clients going forward.***Do not buy this.***"
3,Don't seem worth the price,I heard alot of good things about this stuff so i bought some. After reading the instructions and using it as directed cats still had a few flee's on them. I thought it would kill them all but didn't work that way for me. I wasnt seeing adult flee on them but still a few babies even after a week.
4,Happy with Frontline,I am very happy with my purchase of Frontline for Cats. Amazon's pricing is low and they ship fast. I am going to purchase this item again.
1,Fleas wont go away!!!,I have applied two doses of this Frontline to my cats. They still have fleas! Product doesn't work! It's very frustrating because this medicine isn't cheap! And my poor kitties still have fleas. I will not purchase this brand ever again. I will stick with Revolution. I know that it works even if it costs more!!
4,Fun in the snow....,"I like David Cook as an author. This book did a good job of holding my interest. I especially liked the descriptions of gnoll society and the gnome warren. The choice to make Vreesar, an ice para-elemental, the main villain was different. Overall, a good book. I'd recommend it for any fan of the Forgotten Realms."
2,Awe inspiring cover art... little to be found inside.,"I read this book some years ago now and I remember not being overly thrilled with it. I don't think that I was happy with the way the story went. The book was purely medicocre, especially in the character development. its a shame, The cover art was awe inspiring, too bad the story wasn't."
5,A great book!,"This was a favourite book of mine when I was about eleven. I read it a few times I believe. It's the story of a young man, orphaned and left behind with a great destiny. And there were a number of things he had to learn before he could defeat the villain. Ultimately he had to learn how to be a master of himself. When I was young, the character appealed to me very much and I somewhat aspired to be like him. I would like to read it again now, if I can find it one of these days. Enjoy! I strongly reccomend it! :)"
2,not recommended,I ordered this since I was starting a bunco group. The first box came and it did not have a bell in it. I contacted Amazon and explained it was missing a piece. They sent me a replacement box. This time the box was missing all the pencils. I had to contact Amazon AGAIN to make sure they knew I would be returning the one set missing not one but two items. Thankfully Amazon is great to deal with but this Talicor Bunco Time set is not recommended. You might have to order two or three just to get a complete set!
5,Fun for a group,"There had been a lot of interest in Bunco, so I bought the game. It's fun to play with a group of 8, but not so much fun with a few people."
3,Bunco Game Set,"I bought this Bunco Game Set to replace a game that I already had. It is a fairly nice set, but everyone plays Bunco a little different, so the tally sheets and the score sheets won't work for us. The bell is of great quality. We won't use the tiny little pencils or the little black dice, as we have fuzzy dice connected on a string that we wear on our neck. I do like the different colored dice. Those will show up well on the tables. I don't know how well the cardboard box will last though- I kind of wish I would have bought a metal tin. The shipping was superfast though!"
1,No dice included in my set!,"I had read another review that mentioned the person had not received the dice that was supposed to come with the game. I assumed it was a fluke but guess what, no dice included in the Bunco game I received today. Hard to play without this!! I'm very disappointed."
1,Not Satisfied,"I was very excited to get this game, but it was missing the game bell. I bought the game from amazon and tried to contact them. I could not find a contact number or email. I emailed the packaging link review over a week ago and still have not heard anything. This is the first time I have been disappointed with something I have bought on amazon."
5,BUNCO is the new BRIDGE,"I just started a ladies BUNCO group a few months ago and needed a good ""beginner kit"". Besides the corny ""fuzzy dice"" the rest of the set is all we need. I did have someone bring a set of die with each number being a different color, which makes counting the numbers much easier. I would recommend getting a few sets of those."
3,Barbie Cake Baker set,"The cakes & pastries are cute, as are the 2 dolls, but the shop case is very cheap & flimsy. My preschooler got it for Christmas and has only played with it twice. She likes the princess Barbies much better."
4,A great beginning book,This is really a step by step book for quilters who don't know much about printing on fabric. I found that much of it was too elementary for me but I definitely learned some good tips and will be referring to it often. It is very clearly written and the explanatory pictures and illustrations are good. Also lots of good ideas for manipulating images.
5,Was looking for this specific instruction,I wanted this information all in one book. Have picked up ideas from time to time from other sources but nothing had it consolidated.
4,"Big, Big Sparkle!","Deep blue and light pink crystals give lots of glitter in any kind of light.This would be great for lots of thick hair. There is a very large pony tail holder which might cause a problem for fine hair.Super seller, fast delivery."
4,I liked It quite a bit.,"I just have to put my 2 cents in about the movie first. Everybody is dogging it and I can't really see why. I've always considered it as one of my favorite horrer movies of all time, if not my favorite. Also, I found the movie to be very complimenting to the book. Just look at the book for a minute... OK, it is obviously a very good read and very thought provoking. However it just doesn't have the qualities that would make a good movie if the screan play were taken directly from the text... OK now that I have ranted and raved, about the book, It is a very good read and I would suggest it to anyone, however, It is just not on the same vibe as the excorcist... so when you start reading legion don't jump in with any preconcieved notions of what it is about and what you think should hapen.... That is the beauty of legion, - it is very eirie on an intellectual level but not on a steriotypical horror novel level. Peace."
1,I GIVE UP!,"Afraid I have to echo the sentiments of the dissenters here. Praise first: the arrangements are rather nice, as they have been for the rest of MP's albums. But I can't help but agree that MP's vocal stylizations are getting pretty nauseating and he now sounds like a parody of himself. What was so wonderful on the ""Evita"" and ""Sunday in the Park"" cast albums is no longer to be found. This and the ""Bernstein-New York"" album had me running for the eject button. Too bad."
1,Many Millions of Fingernails On Many Millions of Blackboards,"Mandy Patinkin is possessed of the ugliest voice ever to be recorded. He makes the lead singer for AC/DC sound like Sinatra. An album best played as a way to rid your home of roaches, mice, and silverfish."
5,Beautiful Birds every day of the year!,I truly appreciate learning about birds every day from looking at my Audobon 365 Birds Calendar. Thanks for the beauty and the learning!
4,Irreverent and cutting,"This is a collection of newspaper articles, written by the wholly irreverent, very clever and possibly slightly mad columnist, Phillip Adams. Many of the topics would probably not be fully understood by non- Australians, as his reminisences centre around very specific suburban memories. As an example, I had conpletely forgotten about the bottles of coloured soft drinks which lined an upper shelf above the fruit and vegetable bins in greengrocers shops in the 40's, never sold and never dusted. His descriptions of well known people can sound cutting and somewhat cruel but the widow of one of his subjects, comedian Jackie Clancy, assures me that his observations are spot on and that she doesn't feel at all upset by his unflattering, albeit admiring remarks.Mr.Adams is quite clearly a very clever, very sharp-witted man and, although some of his stories made me wince a bit, he is nevertheless an extremely readable author."
5,An example for every Field Guide,"This work is all a bird watcher could wish for. The splendid paintings by Tudor add to the very helpful in-depth descriptions. Completed by nearly 1500 distribution maps there's nothing left to wish, except go out there and see them. I used it when birding in Peru and I could still determine nearly all the birds I saw.It's an example for every bird field guide."
3,A reference work: not really a field guide.,"Although undoubtedly good for its time, this thick and weighty volume is now behind the expected standard for current field guides.Having said that, I enjoy the ""old-style naturalist"" species accounts, which are full and interesting (although they are in a separate section to the plates). Other features are identification tables, and black & white line drawings to augment the text.A portion of the plates are in black and white..which can be frustrating. As you can see from the photos I've uploaded, the colour illustrations are OK, but often a little too small or too few to show variation of sexes or ages within each species. The plates often look crowded. The monocoloured range maps (is it a visitor or resident?) are held in a single index at the back.So ultimately I think it is not great for field use, although it is indispensable as a reference work."
4,"Filter sounds great, but the fittings do not fit",The fittings sent with this do not match my old sink(skinny end) at all. The grooves should be on the inside of the adapters for the part where it connects to the sinkhead. I ended up buying an adapter at Ace for $5. Besides that it is great. See: [...]
1,Do Not Buy Aquasana Products!,My AQ-4000 countertop filter also began leaking around the seam where the cowling meets the base. Letters and e-mails to the company were ignored. Please do not patronize this company. Its merchandise is junk.
2,"Good water, but poor quality housing","I used one of these for about 3 years. Every 6 months the housing cracked and started leaking after I changed the filters. They will replace it for free if you join their ""water for life"" program, but you still have to pay $10 shipping every time and go through the hassle of water spills and waiting for delivery.I got fed up and bought the Multipure. The water is as good or better and the housing quality is much better. The Multipure's flow is also about twice as fast, which is nice."
1,(almost) Complete Crap - 2 broken housings in 1 year,"When it isn't breaking and cracking, it does a great job filtering the water, but I've just gone through my second housing in about 1 year's time. The inferior plastic they use on the housing just gives way under normal pressure.I was very, very disappointed that, first, they don't back up their products better (yes, they should replace it for free!), and, secondly, they should have corrected these defects long ago. When I contacted the company for the first replacement, they seemed so blasé about my concerns.search for an alternative"
2,Yet Another Cracked Housing,"I also have experienced the problem of having one of the filter housings cracking at the bottom and leaking water all over my kitchen before I realized it. Otherwise, the unit filters water nicely (but slowly) but what good is it if it is going to crack after a year or two of use - so much for my trying to save money. I had to throw the unit away. From what I see from reading the other reviews about this product (on this site and others), this is a common problem."
2,Threads Break,"The unit filters water fine. I bought the under the counter kit and have had it there for about 1.5 years. After a year, the threads broke on the part you screw in. Customer service sent me a new one...I paid $10 shipping. A few months later, the threads broke on the unit itself, making it useless. When you change filters the unit tends to leak. This is a poorly designed piece of junk...and overpriced."
3,Amazing water! Awful manufacturing!,"I have been using this filter for less than a year and the water quality is awesome. It takes out more contaminants than most systems and the water tastes great.The problem is that the housing is badly made. Once a houseguest accidentally ran hot water through it and the tubing burst and it was an expensive hassle to get it replaced. Now, for seemingly no reason, the housing for the filters actually cracked. My suspicion is that somebody ran too much pressure through it.Because it is such a good filter I am actually going to buy another one. I hope it isn't a stupid choice and that if I'm really careful to not let anyone put a lot of water pressure through it that the plastic won't break again. Why can't they make it more durable!?"
1,Poor quality,This is a very poor and over priced product in my opinion. When the time came to replace its filters the housing leaked from the top part and when i tried to replace the leaking hose the whole section snapped off beyond repair. Unfortunately i had already wasted a good bit of money on a new set of filters for this which are useless now.The only reason i give this product one star is because that's the lowest rating one can give. Don't waste your money on this filter.
1,"Disappointed ...water ""dripping"" not flowing","This system is easy to install, feel good with the taste of filtered water. However, water started to ""drip"" instead of flow after just 32 days of use. Too much too pay for that short period of time."
2,"Weird, But Interesting","I've had this book for a long time--over 15 years. I never much liked it, although it does have some interesting spreads that beginners might like to add to their repertoire. The interpretations of the cards, though, are wildly different from anything you are likely to find in any other mainstream tarot text. Perhaps I'd have a more generous appreciation for this book if I had the deck that the authors refer to, but as a book for users of more standard decks, this book's interpretations are close to useless."
5,Action packed thriller from first to last page,"African-American bounty hunter C.J. Floyd is frequently without money but never without adventure. His entourage includes Jamican born cowboy Billy De Long, the beautiful,patient, loving girlfriend Mavis; outgoing secretary and soon to be lawyer, Julie; ex-marine, new secretary Flora Jean; and ex-rodeo cowboys Dittier and Morgan.C.J needs these key individuals to maintain his business and actually to sustain his life. He is a bail bondsman and sometimes bounty hunter who performs his work in the new, wild west.This is the third in a series of novels by Mr. Greer and I think it is his best work yet."
3,david wayne/metalchuch+mike howe/ heretic-switched=better metal church and reverend,this is a good cd better than old metal church no not really but this was a realy good band but a classic singer swapping.the best track I thing is the great metal dirge cover of black sabbath's hand of doom but the rest of the cd dosen't suck either is original but never my bag.
4,Gore at his best,"Lincoln is a monumental masterwork in scope and a fine work of of historical fiction that offers combination of civil war knowledge wrapped in modern literary technique. In this story, Vidal, the master of the pen peeks into the minds and motives of the men around Lincoln"
4,Lincoln,"Be sure to read this one.... It is written by Gore Vidal and is an easy read. It is just as if he were there and is written as he saw it. It is factual, but is a Novel. It is factual in that Lincoln did these things, but the Novel part is that the author made up conversations between certain people... It was fascinating and I could not put it down."
4,Enjoyable Lincoln Fiction,"Enjoyable fictional account of Lincoln and his administration during the Civil War. The narrative is a third person almost omniscient in that Mr. Vidal did not quite have the chutzpah to try and speak for the Tycoon, though the device works well for this work. The novel is primarily concerned with the characters and the plot of the war and political situation provides the framework for them to be portrayed. As always with Mr. Vidal's earlier work, the writing and wit is enjoyable."
3,I wish I had read the book rather than listening to the tape,Very sketchy. I like Vidal's writing but the tape must have been edited with a meat cleaver. All that was on the tape seemed to be excerpts. Those were tantizing enough. But I couldn't recommend the tape version.
4,A Little Far Fetched (And Intended To Be).,"This book is very entertaining.Gore Vidal is an excellent author. However, this is not necessarily a good historical novel. It is quite long on conjecture and supposition, too much so. As a result, the history, the central topic that sells this book, is skewed, questionable.But that is quite alright. It is why Mr. Vidal titled it, Lincoln: A Novel. There is no reason not to enjoy this work, it is good. Just understand that Vidal's book is more good, novelist conjecture than solid, factual history. It is an interesting and fun read, one to be enjoyed."
2,This book is thin and unfocused.,"After reading the reviews on this page, I was looking forward to reading this book. However, after getting about four hundred pages into it, I was completely dissappointed and frustrated. The book spends way too much time exploring what I perceive to be completely irrelevant storylines (i.e., the courtship of Kate Chase, daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury), yet deals with such events as the debacle at Fredericksburg with literally one passing line. Maybe I'm missing something, but this book seems to be more written toward being a made-for-TV miniseries than great historical fiction. I believe the only reason I gave this book even two stars is because I have an interest in the subject matter."
5,Introduce yourself to Lincoln again for the first time,"I really enjoyed this book because it gave me a richer experience of this history. I think this is why historical fiction is important to read. This book really brings these historical characters to life. Instead of being abstract historical figures they become human beings with real lives and problems. This is why I love (some) historical fiction because they bring these figures to life and gives readers a much more intimate and realistic portrayal of their lives.Vidal's Lincoln is one of the finest examples of historical fiction I have yet to come across. Vidal's knowledge and his excellent style allow him to breathe new life into this story. I highly recommend this brilliant book. It will give readers a valuable perspective, and it will reintroduce readers to one of the US's most important presidents. Read this book to be entertained, but don't be surprised when you find yourself being educated at the same time."
4,I WANT MORE VIDAL,"This isn't only a novel about the famous President; it's also about his Cabinet (particularly his Secretary of State and his Secretary of the Treasury), his Army generals, his family and his enemies. It is a portrait of a smart man with a lot of trouble in his hands. After 650+ pages, I still wanted to know ""what's gonna happen next"". Highly commendable."
2,"Lincoln, by Gore Vidal","I found the book very hard to get into and I love history. I will try again to read it, maybe this time I'll make it through."
2,Lincoln's faith misrepresented,"Recently in a tv documentary on this beloved president, Gore Vidal was interviewed a few times, and presentedAbe as not being a Christian. At first he wasn't, although Abe kept the faith his mother taught him - that oftrying to follow the old testament laws, which were ""nailed to the cross"" when Christ died, and a new set oflaws (only 2) came into existence. His mother didn't get to tell him this, however, so it took awhile beforehe came to the truth about Jesus. It was through a woman, and it led him to pray on his knees. Thishistorical information was only recently released.... It was in the hands of his church, and will movelisteners to tears.Sorry, Mr. Vidal.... the evidence is now in.[...]"
5,Superlative Historical Fiction,"This is a near-perfect example of how to write historical fiction -- a novel that brings to life Lincoln and his tumultuous times, deeply researched and detailed, with fascinating dialogue, plot development, wrapped in a completely immersive historical experience. You really do feel as if you are there.Gore Vidal's essays are always top-notch, but his fiction in my opinion sometimes suffers from overly cute premises or weak story lines.Not here. This is as good as it gets.I not only learned a lot from this book, I was completely entranced and couldn't put it down."
3,"garage door trouble, etc","Great idea for a toy, great looking too. Unfortunately the garage door to the firestation gets broken easily. It comes off of its track and is difficult to get up and down. We own two of these toys(we have twins) and it is an issue on both. We got ours at Costco and it came with the firemen and the firetruck. The boys (2 and a half) can't get the firemen in and out of the firetruck cab on their own which is frustrating. They definitely play with it some but not as much as I had hoped."
4,Great imagination play manipulative,"As with the other reviewers, our garage door broke on the first day. So no garage door. My two year old son hasn't missed it and has played with this set every day for at least two months. He also has the fire truck which fits in the garage, four firefighter and other accessories (helicopter, dog etc.). It's great to have a place for him to live out his firefighter stories and make up new ones.Overall, I recommend this product. It's not the sturdiest, but does the job."
4,garage door difficulties,"My 3 children love this playset, but we had trouble with the garage door. The wood door was warped so it didn't fit properly. We ended up throwing away the door and just playing without it. The kids didn't notice and still love this set. We've had it for 2 years and it's still a favorite. The accessories that came with it are great too. Lots of fun for all my kids (age 5, 3 and 1). It's a tough toy that can handle the wear and tear! I'd recommend it to others and advise to just throw away the garage door!"
2,"Great music, terrible production","I purchased this CD from a dump bin some years ago. On listening to it, I found the missing channels really annoying, it really distracts from the performance. I attended a lot of Monday Night Jazz sessions at the Four Queens in Las Vegas, the host was Alan Grant, the host on this CD. I mentioned this CD to him, and he obviously was displeased with this recording, as he kind of let out a growl and said how terrible the production was. I haven't played this CD since, but it's time to give it a listen and Ill get back to you."
3,Detail you may or may not want,"Not a page turner, but if you have an existing interest in the subject, worth the effort. Much of the book concerns the peripheral subjects... Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Holland, France, Spain, the Pope. The common people of England are also examined, as they struggled with famine, plague, loss of land, and the shifting tsunamis of the religious world. Thus the motives of the powerful people around the English throne in the 1500s are brightly illuminated. Those ""common knowledge"" high points of history are brought into sharper focus by the detail provided of occurrences between the landmark events."
2,Not perfect,"This one didn't work for me.I found the strips too small for the legs and too big for the other parts. I won't buy a product that says it's for ""everything"" again.You get two towlettes, or you can use witch-hazel. Then you apply talc powder and you're ready.For me this was less effective and more painful then other brands."
5,Amazing,Very intellectual. Outspoken. Love the suspense. A conversation you will never forget. A powerful ending. Just touching with some laughter.
5,A Favorite!,"This is one of the greatest dialog films I've ever seen. These two excellent actors, of whom I never would have guessed would sign up to discuss the existence of God, nailed it! I recommend that every Christian see this film. For the Christian, this film provides a clear understanding of the labor-intensive work of planting the seed of faith. It is not a matter of simply going out in the field and throwing out a few seeds (biblical words or principles), but rather, it is a matter of understanding that just like the farmer, one must prepare the ground to receive before attempting to plant the seed. Samuel L. Jackson's character (Black) underwent quite a test of his own faith and convictions in this film. This is an excellent teaching tool for the Church and for the Church's responsibility of ministry. Bravo!!"
3,Cormac McCarthy!,Got this because there really aren't enough CM novels in movie form IMHO. It is a play. And a good one at that. Somewhat of a downer. But cuts right to the quick of why some want to live and others would rather sit this life out if possible.
3,It missed the boat!,"Just watched this movie and thought it was well done, acting, script, etc. It really makes one think about God and the destiny of each person when he/she dies. Unfortunately, McCarthy's script missed the boat, badly! For all the pontificiating by both characters and dancing around the truth of God's Word, neither of them opened the bible and referred, at minimum, to John 3:16. And that stark absence left one with nothing but despair regarding salvation. It's for certain that one man cannot argue another man into God's kingdom and without the gospel, that is, Jesus Christ and Him crucified, it's totally impossible."
2,Much ado about nothing,"Two very fine actors with a script that is far less than worthy of them. Tedious, too long, too verbal, not interesting enough and the ending a disappointment"
5,Absolutely wonderful,"This is one of the most moving presentations that I have ever seen, and I am three score and seventeen years young. A must see."
4,new to me,"i never seen a movie where it takes place entirely in one room. you would think that it would be boring, but it was actually very interesting. i enjoyed this film because i cared what happens to these characters, and i was hanging on to every word said thoughout. and it really takes some strong convincing actors to pull it off like sam and tommy did. seeing samuel trying to convince and save tommy lee's character that life was worth living was powerful throughout. i recommend this movie to anyone whos looking for a movie thats a little far from the normal movies out there. especially if your a fan of the book."
1,Made from a terrible print,"In my book, Metropolis deserves at least five stars out of five. This is just an incredible movie. However, the print from which this video was made is a sacrilege. In spite of another review to the contrary, this is a bad print. It is either overexposed or underexposed, the intertitles are fuzzy and cut off at the edges, and it is just altogether a disappointment to those of us who love this film. Try to obtain the version from Kino International which seems to be the best one out there in English.The version by Moroder is also worth seeing. It is a crisp print with lots of restored scenes that are not found in other versions. However, it has been color tinted and has a modern rock scoring. Many people hate it. I personally think it's great, but consider it to be a different work of art from Fritz Lang's original.My rating: 1 star out of 5 (because of the print)"
2,"The Barebones edition, only reason to buy is price.","I picked this DVD up at a local store, because I've been meaning to see the movie and it was quite cheap. It's the original 1927 theater cut (I couldn't tell you if the tinting was added later or not), which means it's only a small part of Lang's masterpeice. The plot is, as it was, choppy and hard to follow without reading up on the movie itself. The scenes that were cut seem to have been important, in that you get the general gist of the story with this truncated version, but there are things you won't pick up on unless you watch it repeatedly.It's a poor version of the classic, but the price is right. If you want to see the masterpeice, buy the restored, authorized edition as was recommended above. If you want to watch a mildly entertaining silent film that sounds like the soundtrack was put together by the Residents, this is for you."
5,DON'T LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS,"Amazon messed up on this product as far as reviews are concerned. They are posting reviews on this particular version of Metropolis from a different version of this film, and yes that version was awful, horrible quality.However, this version is as good as silent film restoration can get. This is an amazing film to begin with and with an extensive restoration and lost footage added, this is the definitive version of Metropolis. If you are a silent film enthusiast, or if you even like silent film at all, this is a must own.Like I said don't listen to the bad reviews, they aren't accurate. This version of Metropolis was released in November 2010, and there are reviews posted on this product that date back to 1999. Make sure when you are reading reviews on this product check the date of when it was posted."
3,Which version?,"From the descriptions of the film, this one is a restored version with still storyboards filling in the missing segments. A COMPLETE copy of the film has recently been discovered in Argentina. It has been digitally restored & cleaned up, & will soon be available (may already be available) from Movies Unlimited. (Sorry about mentioning the competition.)"
2,Wrong speed!,"I had a long argument with KINO after this restoration was released in the theaters. I know how difficult it would have been to release it theatrically at anything other than 24 fps. But with the DVD, we finally had a chance to see this film at the correct speed! They refused.The claims of 24 being the ""authentic"" speed all rest on one score that actually has ""28 fps"" hand-written on it. I think that was just somene's error.The simple fact is that if you watch the film, it is clearly shot at silent speed. People are sped-up at 24fps, as they are in all silent films. It's painful to watch.So sad - KINO could've included a version at the correct speed, even with no sound - I would've happily played my own music while I watched this beautiful restoration at the right speed. As it is, we have a gorgeous print with characters who move like the Keystone Cops - what a missed opportunity."
3,See the 2010 version with original score,"The new Kino release of the ""complete"" Metropolis...All but 6-8 minutes anyway is now available with the original Huppertz score. Definitely superior to all previous versions and the score is excellent, really helping to set the film's tone. You'll be pleased to see the Thin Man in action and Freder and Josaphat getting to do some real daring-do in the Workers City."
4,Metro Rest,I found it very interesting and thought provoking - but that would be a normal response. The time of the script to the end of the filming must have a been a masive nerve trip - of course that is the way that it should have been. The WW1. The insight was erie. Like most films today the artwork for the posters would be something that catches the film goers eye regardless of how much time that this scene is captured on film. I do not believe that a picture with sound could have captured as much provication as the silent one has remarkably done.
4,Inspirational film making,"So ahead of it's time and not comparable to anything before or since. Did a lot to show people the power of cinema in it's infancy, and to me it still looks incredible some 90+ years later.The imagination and vision of Lang's skyscraper landscapes and draconion underbelly of poverty as it's hidden foundation speaks just as loudly to today's world as it ever did."
1,Terrible print of a masterpiece,"This dvd is almost unwatchable. The film is actually printed so that a significant portion of the sides of the film runs off the edge of the dvd format. The image quality is poor and the music is unappealing. Get the Georgio Morodo version if you can, all things considered it is by far the best print available."
1,Metropolis,"The DVD of Metropolis is truly bad. How bad? Well in the first 30 seconds the title is out of focus and is cut off at the ""L"" in Metropolis. Do not buy this DVD."
5,GENIOUS Restored! The (Almost) Perfect Metropolis at Last,"Metropolis is a film as fresh and relevant as any of today's cinema, and a lot more interesting than most! This '5' star review isn't to suggest that after 84 years and numerous edits, losses and attempts at restoration, Metropolis is in perfect condition. But much of the long (and believed, forever) lost footage--nearly 20% of Lang's original version--has been found and restored from VERY damaged 16mm stock; and it's inclusion is stunning in its overall effect on the storytelling and visual impact of the film. And on Blu-ray it looks as good as one could ever imagine considering the history it's survived. This is the result of decades of dedicated film 'sleuthery' and the efforts of film preservationists and restorationists from around the world. In short.......METROPOLIS IS A CINEMATIC TREASURE!"
4,Let's be honest,"When looking for a copy of Metropolis, there are many who would tell you one version is better than the other. By and large, they will all have powerful arguments to make about how Helm is not profiled right in this shot or how this particular scene is actually 3 seconds longer in version ""X"" released in 1972.All entitled to an opinion.This particular version may not be the best, but it *does* give the viewer an excellent experience for the money.No, this disc is not loaded with poster art or running commentary, but it does present an excellent cut of the film by nearly any standard.The DVD quality is good, but the print seems to be a bit used.Let's face it, you could do much worse than this edition. If you are a hardcore fan of Fritz Lang, there are better to be had. But for a guy like me who simply enjoys the film, the style, the story, this was an wonderful disc.Turn it on, turn all the lights off, turn down the soundtrack, and enjoy the movie."
5,Great edition!,"There have been many editions of this out there. This is a really good one, of a very poignant subject, that never goes away!"
1,Don't buy the Synergy Ent edition,"Not much to say about a cheap, almost unwatchable transfer. It's not even worth the low price, believe me."
1,Unwatchable,"Don't buy this. I love Metropolis. This edition is terrible. I've seen Metropolis at least 10 times at various times and in various places over the past 25 years, and I've never seen a print this bad."
1,This Sucked!,"This disc was the worst, could not even get through the whole movie! It stopped working about 1 hour and 20 minuets into the awesome movie that Metropolis is. Terrible disc/dvd, great movie!"
2,need better print,"I agree with Jim Gay's review. This is one of the great early films -- the predecessor to Blade Runner in its imagery and its plot, but this DVD falls far short of doing justice to the original. The sound track is an unrelated series of pieces of impressionist classical chamber music, and the picture is almost indecipherable much of the time. When Giorgio Moroder's colorized version came out, purists groaned, but in retrospect it was better than what's currently available."
1,Wait for the Kino DVD,"If you're reading this, you doubtlessly know already that Metropolis is a magnificent classic of the silent era. No definitive version is available yet, they're all incomplete, but this DVD is especially atrocious. The picture quality is an insult to DVD technology. I just saw the theatrical release of Kino International's new restoration, and it's a beautiful, pristine print. The film has been restored to be as close to the original theatrical release as possible, with title cards inserted to describe the missing scenes. This version will be out on DVD in early 2003, and it should be worth the wait."
1,great early classic as a poor DVD,"This is one of the great classics of early German cinema but this DVD version is just awful. You get what you pay for here and what you get is junk. This DVD looks like it was projected off-center on a sheet. Almost unwatchable, a real embarrassment that Amazon even carries it.Movie 5 stars DVD 0 stars"
1,Buy Region 2,This is perhaps one of the worst DVD transfers around. Not only is the print bad but the entire film is out of focus. The region 2 version of the film on DVD does not suffer from these problems. If you want this film on DVD don't by this version.
5,"THE ""Sleeper Hit"" of 1984","All the other reviewers are, of course, 100% correct. Personally, I think the movie itself is ancient existential/socialist bull hockey- BUT, what with the judicious tinting, added sound effects, and a BRILLIANT musical score, all courtesy of Georgio Moroder - it's simply fascinating. I watched this one afternoon with a close friend who is a college instructor, a friend who is 180 degrees different from me politically -and when it was over, we both went ""YEAH."" Folks, trust me: the ""Moroder version"" is THE ONE TO GET. 12/7/12: It IS on DVD now! Even better! Check it out!"
1,This absolute classic deserves better!,When I saw this movie in twice a cinema with live music I was thrilled to the max both times.This DVD version though falls short in musical score and overall picture quality. It's a disgrace to Fritz Langs' masterpiece.But for the reasonable price and no other easy sources available you might decide to live with it...
1,TERRIBLE,Don't even think of buying this awful copy. I couldn't stand to watch more than 10 minutes. I now use mine as a coaster (along with all those MSN and AOL discs I keep getting in the mail)
1,"Do not let this low price tempt you, this dvd is awful!","This should not even rate a star. Either wait until a ""speciality company"" issues a special edition on DVD, or buy the VHS edition issued in late 80's (with new soundtrack). See also Dark City DVD, devotes entire special section with comparisons to Metropolis."
1,A Very Disappointing Transfer,"It's a shame that a significant classic such as Metropolis should be the victim of bad execution to the DVD format. The quality of the print is poor. It is dark and not sharp -- obviously the result of using a print that is several generations removed from the original negative. The opening card is so out of focus, I had to check to see if I still had my glasses on. Worse, whoever did the telecine transfer zoomed into the frame -- the result is that everything is cut-off from the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the screen. Very frustrating with a full-frame movie.I have VHS copies that are heads and shoulders above the quality of this DVD. If you want an example of a bad DVD transfer to show your friends, use this as an example -- otherwise find a good copy on VHS."
2,An Opinion Contrary to Convention,"I kept waiting for the great looking female robot (what really qualifies this as sci-fi), and she has all of a minute of screen time! All that work to design and create her, so why not find a way to use her? As to the poignancy of the narrative, it is basically angry communist propaganda. Time did not prove that philosophy relevant. There is nothing particularly groundbreaking about the story, the cinematography, nor the acting. And the entertainment value is fairly low for a film this deep into the silent era. I really don't think this film is at all entertaining or important. Fire away, but I think this is probably the overrated silent film ever."
2,Impossible to view,"Sadly it was not possible to view this classical masterpiece because the dvd had the wrong regioncode ( NTSC in case of PAL, necessary for Europe). Nor Amazon neither me could know this because the box didn't mention the regioncode but the disc did not mention it either. So I could not enjoy it. I cannot return the dvd because I needed to play it to find out the regioncode problem. Something to know when you're living in Europe and want to view Metropolis."
1,Wait for it.........,a MUCH better version is in the works from the print found in South America. I'm waiting for it. (I already have two other versions.)
5,Best Experiance,"I now that there are still parts lost, but this felt like a complete experience for me as such ect."
1,My 1 star is false...,"This ""restoration"" of ""Metropolis"" doesn't deserve the one star that I gave it! Madacy Entertainment has ruined a classic film because they were careless. ""Metropolis"" deserves better than that because it was the first science fiction film created. Without ""Metropolis"" we wouldn't have ""Bladerunner"" or ""Final Fantasy"" and ""Metropolis 2002"". ..."
1,I like it even less than originally!,"I feel sorry for the more unsuspecting people that work for Madacy Entertainment! This is a company that besmirched its own reputation by releasing the WORST quality prints of classic films, and yet they're still pressing on! BTW, I heard a rumor (let's just say a little birdy told me) that quite possibly (but PLEASE don't quote me) Criterion or some reputable company might release THEIR version of METROPOLIS on DVD. If there's any justice from the movie gods, we could use it now!"
2,METROPOLIS: I could've assembled a better cut AND scored it!,"OK, I bought this disc--I'm hugely disappointed this wasn't the version that was broadcast on WNET, Ch. 13 in NY about 20 yrs. ago with a sinister synthesiser-music score. I DO hope at some point we see either the aforementioned Moroder version on DVD or the one I saw, or at least SOMETHING resembling the original film!"
2,The Movie Is Great...But this release is terrible,"Thank god I saw this before I bought it. I was not impressed with this version at all. The quality was just not there, for picture & music.I'll stick to my 80's version of the classic, it was released though ""Vestron Video"", and its been modified.But this version has some cool groups from the 80's that performed on the soundtrack, such as Bonnie Tylor, Queen, Jon Anderson, Lover Boy, ect, and I do belive it is a classic to be experienced.Now, this is not the fully restored version, but it is very clear and clean."
2,Bad transfer of a brilliant movie,"The music is terrible, and the quality is horrendous! The music just didnt fit the scenes at all. I sure hope Criterion picks this title up and restores it with the ""original soundtrack""."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"This version is an insult to the film, being of horrible quality as well as a version that Lang himself detested. It's not even worth the low price. So what to do? The most accurate version of this film since 1927 has just been completely reconstructed in Berlin after a three-year effort, using the latest restoration technology as well as newly discovered footage that doubles the running time of the SEVERELY edited existing versions. It is being shown in cinemas now, and upon its release on DVD later this year, it will be the only version of this film to own. The version offered above is basically like an 8-track tape from 1975, and the editing and music makes the film look like a bad comedy. (This is not the Moroder/Queen version, which is far better, but still nothing like this latest version.) Do yourself a favour and wait for the restored release. It's incredible."
4,New restoration scheduled for release 12/2010,"A new, more complete print has been discovered in Buenos Aires. In 2008, a safety 16mm negative, struck from the deteriorating 35mm nitrate, was made. It was transferred to Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Stiftung which, despite the damaged and compromised nature of the print, undertook a restoration of the original film. It's expected to be released on DVD around the end of 2010. Many questions will be answered on this page: [...]-- and in an FAQ link from that page. This is quite historical; the edit released in many theatres bordered on incoherency at times, due to large and important bits of the story having been removed. I look forward to seeing Lang's interpretation. My rating is only because one was required; obviously it's premature."
1,Poor screen version--do not get it!,"Well, I was compiling a collection of my 25 favorite films, and this is on it. Prior to my purchase, I read reviews on this, but they seemed positive.Forget that! The version is poor , choppy, and most dissapointing(I've seen this film before) on a 55"" screen, the film is in a box that uses only half the screen andd cuts out subtitles, dialogue, even implortant parts of the pictures. I will get another copy, BUT DO NOT GET THIS ONE! Pay a little more, and get a decent copy"
5,Finally!,"All those years I've been hanging on to my VHS copy of this version, now finally it's coming out in (hopefully) good quality. Many people hate this film, or rather this edition, but I liked it then and still do.Metropolis would probably have sunk into total oblivion, had not Giorgio Moroder generated new interest in this classic by presenting it to a new audience."
3,"Fans, wait just a little longer!","It took a while, but I finally received word from a representative from the Murnau Foundation, who owns distribution and restoration rights to the recently discovered print of ""Metropolis"" in Buenos Aires, that work on a restored (and almost whole!) version will be completed (hopefully) sometime in early 2010. No specific day given as DVD and TV rights have to be finalized as well. This should prove worth the wait. They do other great work in film restoration, and we should all take a minute sometime to thank them for their efforts."
3,"Five star restoration, three star print","Perhaps I'm picking nits here, but I find it regrettable that this print wasn't transfered to DVD before it was exhibited in theaters. The DVD reveals a number of black lines, from emulsion scratches on the source print, which occur now and then, throughout, but are particularly frequent and distracting for about the last reel. I also see dirt in the projection gate for a short time. Couldn't Kino justify striking a fresh print for this DVD edition, from their digitized negative? Nonetheless, I concur with the consensus that the restoration, aside from the warts on this print, looks and sounds beautiful."
4,Very forward-looking for its time,"For what it is and when it was made, this is a forward-looking film that gives a simplistic but appealing message about treating workers fairly and not building empires on the backs and on the blood, tears, and sweat of others. Obviously, many parts of the world are still not that progressive and probably never will be, human nature being what it is.The idea of blending a robot with a human is also fascinating and is explored to some degree here, both literally and metaphorically.The score seems to be pervasive and rather distracting, and the quality isn't all that good. But these elements can be overlooked for the overall purpose."
5,superb on all levels,"Magnificent restoration, and a tremendously atmospheric score - couldn't recommend it any more than I do"
3,Intertitles in English,"While I very much appreciate the overall quality of the restoration, I am appalled by the decision to translate the intertitles into English. What a missed opportunity; what disrespect for the historicity of the work. I venture to say that many of my colleagues in academia will continue to put up with the bad sound and the poor video quality of their old VHS edition."
3,Only for the most diehard of classic film critics,"Understand that this is a silent film made in the 1920's, simple. This version of Metropolis is well over 2 hours in length and unless your really into these types of movies you will need to take a couple breaks just to stomach it. Personally I would not waste the additional few dollars on the Blu-Ray version as the normal DVD is as high of resolution and sound quality as they can get from the various original recording reals. Most of the format is 4:3, some has been slightly enhanced to be more panoramic. This is a movie for adults into early classic film, social science, and recoding history, anyone else will probably be bored out of their mind."
3,Terrible music ruins classic,"This has always been one of my favorites. To have this new cut makes it even more exciting.However, the music kills any tension the film hopes to generate.In the 70's, I saw this film on PBS as part of a series of classic films. It was from the BBC and had an electronic soundtrack composed by William Fitzwater and Hugh Davies.Finally, someone got it right! Turned the film into the horrific masterpiece it is.Contacted Criterian regarding this. Sadly, it is not included."
1,Lies and butchery,Why oh why don't they just settle on one good print with a synchronized soundtrack that matches the futuristic feel of the film and then make it play out for the full 139 minutes! The number of times I've seen 139 mins of the back of the box and then wound up playing 86mins on my VCR to get from start to finish on each version is insane!This movie has been shat on by mindless marketeering and lab people with no taste.
2,Wait,"Not a good copy of this great movie. I'd wait and buy the ""Restored Authorized Edition."" Even though I bought this version, I've ordered the other. That's how much I like Metropolis is general."
2,I had to own this one,"I am a huge film fanatic, not to mention a big sci-fi fan...Horrible DVD transfer. The music soundtrack that was just slaped on is ridiculous, but Metropolis is Film History. Probably the first real science fiction film ever made, if you ever see it as it was ment to (check out local film art houses, and if they have an original Wurlitzer Organ playing along like they do at ""The Tampa Theater"" so much the better), you would see that it is one of the greatest films ever made."
2,Great movie HORRID DVD,This is the problem with movies that fall into the public domain. Anyone can release a copy and BUYER BEWARE! This version is one of the worst DVDs I have ever seen. You know right from the opening titles which don't fit within the frame. The whole thing looks like it a videotape of the film being projected onto a bed sheet. .....
1,"Great Film, Horrid DVD","This film is great, its a masterpiece, a classic, words cannot begin to describe both the importance of this film.This DVD, however, is horrid,, featuring a grainy picture, that at times looks like the film was stored, unprotected, in someones garage for 70 years, and music that seems to have nothing to do with the film.If you can't find any other version and really have to own a copy, then this may just be inexpensive enough for you to overlook the failings. Personally, I recommend the Kino version, which is now unfortunately out-of-print, and would never recommend the tinted 80's version as the soundtrack is just too distracting.One final thing: No matter what anyone else says, this version is NOT tinted. Only one tinted version exists, and this is not it."
4,sci-fi,"the special effects in this ancient movie are genius! any movie buff, especially of the silent era, needs to at least see this movie (if not own it)."
2,terrible quality,"I must add my voice to the chorus of disapproval surrounding the VHS and DVD releases of ""Metropolis"". The Australian release of this title is, I assume, identical to the ""newly restored"" 139 minute version mentioned in other reviews. Warning: this version is as bad as everyone is saying. The picture quality is appalling, the soundtrack complete shlock, and the film speed is crushingly slow; my memories of this great movie were dealt a severe blow. It was also embarassing to invite a bunch of friends who'd never seen the movie to sit through it. Please attempt to preview this transfer before buying, otherwise you may never watch another silent film again."
1,Movie restored again,"Just for all those people waiting for a better version of Metropolis: there's a new restoration! Yes, they've showed it here in Rotterdam (too bad I didn't know, I read it in the papers afterwards) and the reviews are very good. It seems to be a restoration that began in 1998 and was finished in 2000. I'll just wait till that version is on DVD."
1,I'm still waiting to see a good print of this movie!,"When I saw this DVD at a bargain price, I said ""Wow, I've got to get this deal."" I was ... It's not much money, but I could have spent it on a couple of six-packs. I thought DVD was supposed to mean outstanding quality. I've seen 16mm films on Fatty Arbuckle from 1920 that look better than this. Absolutely the worst I've ever seen. The ""soundtrack"" sounds like a bad funeral ... I've never seen this movie all the way through because every print I've ever seen loses my interest after 15 minutes or so. Maybe it's just way past its prime. Maybe it's just a relic.I'm confused. Well, at least I've got a new coaster for the beer."
3,"The movie's five stars, but the transfer...","Yes, the transfer ..., but since the Criterion Collection seems not to want to bother, it's probably the best we've got. The bad reviews are exaggerating; I've seen worse transfers, both of this film and in general.Also, this DVD has a longer cut than most, and anything's better than the butchering Moroder gave it in the 80s. Definitely not a respectful version of this film, but at ... bucks, you know what you're getting into."
1,A BUTCHERING OF BRILLIANCE,"This may be the worst transfer in the albeit short history of DVD, but it might quite possibly qualify as the worst in the entire future of DVD transfer as well. It looks like some company decided to be the first out the gate with Metropolis on DVD and didn't bother to do much more than set a DV camera in front of a TV and taped the screen image of a bad transfer on VHS. I'm not sure which version this is in terms of content (there have been several different edit versions circulating on tape over the past twenty years or so). The reason I don't know is because I couldn't watch more than about ten minutes before I said, ""Screw this!"" and ejected the disc. The only reason I gave it one star is because ""no stars"" wasn't a choice."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This DVD does no justice for this Sci_Fi classic. You would think if someone was to put Metropolis out on DVD, they would at least put out a quality print. Sometimes the images on screen are so bright, you're just looking at a white screen. The soundtrack sucks because for one it doesnt correspond to the screen action, and two, it sounds too ""clean"" for this terrible print. My advice? Save a few bucks and pick up the Giorgio Moroder version at an online auction house. The print quality is much better, it includes a few missing scenes and still shots, and if you dont like the early 80's soundtrack, turn the volume down and play what you feel like. I would have given it one star but it's such a great movie if you get the right version."
1,"Great movie, but geeeez","I know this film is 75+ years old, but did they HAVE to use a master that was so badly scratched,scuffed, distorted and aged? As mentioned previously, the laser disc release was MUCH more pristine. I don't mind the music 'misplaced' with the action, and I'm certainly glad that I didn't shell out ten bucks for Bonnie Tyler yammering away on the late 80's release of Metropolis, but this DVD felt like it skimmed on quality to get it out of the door. Metropolis deserves better than this treatment, especially in a digital format. If we live in a society where Natalie Cole can sing with her dead father(and we do), we can see the negative to Metropolis restored."
1,Disgraceful Product,"Oh, I suppose it won't clog up your player like a crappy tape would do to a VCR.The picture is horrible (transferred from a bad video, not a print) and cropped ridiculously.I haven't seen the Moroder version (although it was always on the rental shelf in my younger days, and now I'm kicking myself for not seeing it).Based on this DVD I would also warn people about which version of Night of the Living Dead they buy (there is a Madacy version out there)."
1,The Worst Quality DVD I Have Seen,"Even at the low price, do not waste your money on this DVD. The picture quality of this DVD is the worst I have ever seen. There are better prints available to remaster it from. I have the laserdisc version and it is much better quality. Wait until another company releases it. I should have known better than to buy a Madacy product, given the poor quality of their other releases."
3,Made from standard workprint.,"I was excited to see Kino finally released Moroder's version of Metropolis. Unfortunately they have mastered the Blu Ray from an old work print they found lying around as opposed to mastering it from the negative.I saw Moroder's version when it was released and it was in better condition than the print they have used for this release. It 's unfortunate because it all comes down to money. Mastering from the negative would have cost Kino more than mastering from an existing print. Thumbs down on that choice.Amazon however, shipped extremely fast, as usual. I'm always happy with their service."
1,DON'T BUY THIS VERSION!!,This is the worst print of Metropolis I have ever seen. A complete waste of your money. It is 6.99$ for a reason folks.Do not buy it.
1,"Extraordinary film, lousy transfer","The film itself doesn't get one star. I'd give it five stars. Unfortunately, you can't give it a breakdown. Five stars film, four stars for music, etc... anyway...I think this film is fantastic. Every serious fan of the medium should watch this work. However, this dvd transfer is very disappointing. I'm not going to go on at length about it because I've read some very creative and, sadly, accurate descriptions of what it looks like. While this DVD is a bargain, it is not worthy of the film. Don't buy it and wait for a nicer version to come along. Now, I know the film is over 80 years old, so I'm not expecting crystal clear quality, but they could do a better job."
1,I threw my copy away.,"I'm writing this so you don't make the same mistake I did. The picture quality of this video was so bad that I literally pitched it into the trash. It's a wonderful movie, but this is by far the worst DVD I have ever seen -- it's unwatchable. The tinted Moroder videotape version and laserdisc formats are much, much better."
1,"Oh, please!","The other reviewers are correct about this, the movie is good, but the Madacy DVD sold here for under $10 is terrible. You can tell it's been transferred from video, because there is a horizontal dropout-discoloration in the first 10 minutes! It's a shame there are no good versions out, as far as I can tell, and although I haven't seen the ""rock n' roll"" version, I would want an edition with original musical score (if possible). Don't buy this disc. Maybe there exists a better VHS version, but the one sold here is apparently pretty bad also."
1,Do not buy- under any circumstances,"If there were a 0-star rating, this would be it...The video is horribly cropped, as if they transferred it by zooming in on a TV playing the movie. The print is grainy and overexposed, even for a 72-year-old movie.The sound is a joke; the score feels like they're playing Muzak over the scenes. There's no connection at all to the action on-screen, and it is almost like it is trying to be something out of Mozart.Truly an awful DVD, the worst I've bought."
1,Utterly disgusting quality,"Who would take such a profound classic and put so little effort in transfering this. It looks as if ""Madacy"" took a DVD camcorder (if there were such a thing) and set it in front of a a TV to record it. It is out of focus, out of contrast and out of frame. I will NEVER buy a Mandacy product again. These reviews are no exageration!"
2,Not as good as hoped,"A bit over the top, and perhaps too long for the subject matter, even allowing for how old it is"
2,Typically Poor Madacy Effort,"Fritz Lang's greatest silent film, ""Metropolis,"" is a masterpiece of the sci-fi genre, with some thought provoking social commentary and an amazing, nightmarish vision of the future. In fact, it ranks among the best movies ever made.But you wouldn't be able to tell it by this shoddy Madacy disc. A muddy, scratchy version is introduced by title cards that go off the screen and a pretty bad musical score. Things get so bad that first time viewers will have trouble even figuring out what's going on. There are also the usual not-very-good Madacy extras (Poster, Biography, Trivia Game, Credits). In fact, the only reason that I haven't given this disgraceful disc one star is because the movie is just so good.A prestigious, fully restored and digitally remastered version with a full plate of extras has been released by Kino. Get it."
4,Why are these other reviews here???,"I have no idea why these other reviews are here...This is not the same movie, kinda...Giorgio Moroder created a very insightful version of this iconic film. The original was severely edited and rebuilt over the years. Moroder took the basic, what survived film and added a [1980s] contemporary soundtrack. He did leave out some references to ""moloch"" and did not r-time the film to move in real time, rather than ""jerky-time."" (For those who still do not know, film in the 20s ran at a slower frames-per-second than they do today...hence the jerkiness of the movie. Moroder did not alter that. What he did do was completely modernize a pre-talkie classic. Definitely worth while to have on your shelf, next to the complete versions."
1,Great movie marred by poor DVD production quality,"I was unable to completely view this DVD, apparently due to a bad pressing. Amazon cross-shipped a new DVD, but it had the same problem (any chapter after about 40 would not play or had multiple tracking and audio errors; none of the specials would play at all). I had to get a refund :-(. So terrific movie, but Keno seems to have continuing production problems..."
1,"A ""classic"" that has NOT aged well.","This, one of the greatest films of all time? NO WAY! Your serious film students may disagree with me, but I thought this one was B-O-R-I-N-G!!! The version I saw had a 1980's sound-track added to jazz it up, but the music was so awful I turned it down completely and watched the rest in silence, hoping it would eventually become interesting. It never happened. In fact, I repeatedly wanted to hit the eject button on my VCR, but curiosity over this film's reputation kept me from doing so. Maybe this was the ""Star Wars"" of the 1920's. If so, maybe ""Star Wars"" will someday bore the people of the year 2070 the way ""Metropolis"" bored the heck out of me!"
3,the pitfalls of restoration,"The rating above applies to the version I own, the Excelsior Collector's Edition from Madacy Entertainment. It's only 115m long, and there are portions of the film that are in bad need of restoration. I looked around at the initial description and some of the reviews, but I can't find any mention of the length of this newly restored version offered for sale here, though it seems to be about 2 1/2 hours (the original was 17 reels, or 182m, and for a long time the longest version available was 12 reels, or 128m). That, and some reviewers' concerns about the projection speed (too fast), omitted shots, and omitted title cards make me hesitant about acquiring this ""upgrade."""
2,Gilbert's Law Summaries on Trusts is not worth a purchase,"This book just did not meet my expectations, I learned nothing from this book that I did not already know"
1,Outdated and incorrect,"I began using this book to prep for my trust and estates final exam, but I immediately found some obvious errors. I'm not sure if the errors are a result of it being outdated or the author incorrectly reading the UPC and state statutes. Regardless I found several errors in the first section alone and immediately stopped using it."
1,Such a terrible Single from a terrible Album!,"I cant see how this pathetic horrid single from Ex Westlifer Brian McFadden is wonderfull, its totally terrible, depressive and with such pathetic lyrics ""Real to me"" that anyone on the street could have written, shocking. I'm real lost for words, totally lsot for words how bad this single is. The other songs on it are also so terrible. I think only Westlife Fans may like it, but for all others please skipp this - There are far better singles than this one from this terrible Singer Brian McFadden."
1,You dont need to listen to this,"No one needs to listen to this song. Its rather pathetic. If you want an ""emo"" song, go listen to emo music, not this. This is a pretender and fake piece of music. Dont waste your money on it."
4,A touching story,This is really a touching story! Helen Keller who is blind and deaf is a brave girl and I admit her very much. I think all of you will love it.
1,soiled pages,Recently I visited my grand daughter and saw the above mentioned book thatI purchased some time ago to help her with a report she was working on.Many of the pages were soiled. This is the first book that I ordered from you that arrived in this condition.
2,Bachelorette karoke,I was a little dissappointed with this DVD. I felt it was a liitle fast with no pause in between.
5,Refreshing!,"Take advantage of this read, because it is rare to find one on the topic of Croatian myths that is so thorough. This is mainly because the world has become so accustomed to previous views proliferated by Serbians. Those who accuse it of being propaganda are simply being defensive, because they cannot handle the truth being revealed. Understandable, because how would you feel if what you took as fact is suddenly not so? However, these people need to realize that, with the help of McAdam's piece, these myths are just not what really happened. It was initially propaganda that embedded lies about Croatia, so how is that a better reality than that presented by McAdams, which is far from being propaganda? I am in no way excusing Croatia from their faults, but as you will find out after reading Myth & Reality, their actions, role, and place in this world is far different that what the average American believes."
4,"Product is strudy, as described in ad","There are many space saving products for cabinets, and I don't notice a lot of difference in the quality of them- as long as you don't go for the Dollar Store variety which seem to break apart at the points they are joined. Please read my review of the supplier on this one. That said, this one works fine. It is sturdy enough to hold heavy pots and pans, and adjusts well once inside a cabinet. I was not able to use it where I originally planned to because I couldn't fit it inside the cabinet even in it's collapsed state. Lesson- measure the opening first before ordering space saving products."
5,Billy Idol Forever!!,"I've owned this CD for years - and I never get sick and tired of it.On the contrare. During home parties, my friends ask me - who's that on the stereo? I say, Billy Idol, man. You like it?And they always say - That rocks!Nuff said."
2,Mediocre Idol Product,"I hated this album when it came out, and almost 15 years later, I know now that my gut feeling was right. A big part of it is the songwriting, which is Billy's weakest yet (as of 1990); but then again, he wasn't helped by the extremely session-like dullness of new guitarist Mark-Younger-Smith, who made you wish Steve Stevens hadn't departed.The 'hits' (""Prodigal Blues"", ""Cradle Of Love"", and their cover of ""L.A. Woman"") are fine, but toothless. After the pure pop decadence of ""Vital Idol"", I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was. Skip this one (and Cyberpunk), and stick to his first three albums."
3,Set the Cruise Control to Idol,"First, let me say I love BI and his band with Steve Stevens, what a great combo and music they could create, studio or live. The album is keeping in form with earlier releases, basically where you have 3-5 tracks on the whole affair worth listening to. But, REALLY worth listening to. The only hit was Rock The Cradle, but hits aren't always it.... I put my chips on Prodigal Blues! Anyway, with RTC amongst the tracks, this was supposedly a comeback album for Billy Idol, and it sold well, unlike the preceding disc from 4 years prior (1986), Whiplash Smile, which was wrongly considered a disappointment, when in fact, IMHO, it is his best work ever!!! Buy it, but buy this disc as well for the few tunes really worth listening to, since, after all, it's available for one cent used."
3,"Let's rock, ha ha.","This album by Billy Idol was released in 1990. The great ""Cradle of Love"" was one of his biggest hits, peaking at #2 on the Hot 100. A pretty good cover version of the Doors ""L.A. Woman"" was also released as a single, peaking at #52. Other than those two songs, the album is pretty forgettable. Not bad, just not especially memorable."
5,Another Good CD from Billy Idol.,"Great CD from Billy Idol. If you are a Billy Idol fan, then this is definitely a title that you will want to add to your collection. This CD has all the heart and snarls of the previous CDs. Great job Billy! Keep on rockin'!"
4,"Billy Idol, welcome to the 90's!","Upon hearing he was touring again, I felt the sudden need to listen to one of his albums, but all I could conjure up was the beaten on copy of ""Charmed Life"". It's a very good mix of ballad and fiercely pumping arm tunes.While listening to this disc, I was flashng back to ""rebel Yell"", and ""whiplash smile"", and the Billy Idol I saw live in concert about five times. Even into the 90's, Billy was still pumping out some great tunes. His cover of ""LA Woman"", paid homage to Jim Morrison, and he added his own flavor to it. ""Cradle of Love"" is the first single, and I remember quite vividly that around the time of this album's original release, Billy Idol had a major accident on his motorcycle and with his broken leg, he made the video for ""Cradle of Love"".I still love his music now, after all these years. ""Charmed Life"" is a slightly more mature Billy Idol, who is still pumping that fist furiously."
3,It's Christmas time.,"This album by Billy Idol was released in 1990. The great ""Cradle of Love"" was one of his biggest hits, peaking at #2 on the Hot 100. A pretty good cover version of the Doors ""L.A. Woman"" was also released as a single, peaking at #52. Other than those two songs, the album is pretty forgettable. Not bad, just not especially memorable."
4,Fun movie,I enjoyed the movie alot. Although it was not as good as the first in my opinion it was a lot of fun.
3,MEN IN BLACK 3,It was an ok movie but not as good as I expected. The actors are very talanted but story could have been better
5,MIB 3 is the best yet!,This movie made me laugh out loud.It was worth the price.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are a great combo.Josh Brolin nailed a young Agent K.Without giving anything away....it was fantastic!
3,sort of funny,some decent parts but for the most part not nearly as good as the other two. a lot of the effects looked a little less convincing for this one also. was he budget lower?
3,The Magic is Gone,"The Law of Diminishing Returns (tm) states that if sequels are made to a great movie, none of them will be as good. This law is immutable, though as with all laws, there are exceptions (""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back,"" and ""Spider-Man 2"" spring immediately to mind); however, MiB3 is not one. MiB3 has the feel of being made up as it goes along -- which, from what I understand about the production, is not far from the truth: filming began before a finished script. Will Smith is game, and Josh Brolin damn near steals the show, but Tommy Lee Jones has basically an extended cameo, to the detriment of the entire movie, and nowhere in sight are the wacky aliens from 1 and 2 (no Jeebs or anyone). MiB3 just is not nearly as much fun as the classic first and the reviled second; it distills J's and K's relationship, tells some interesting back story, but without the zany tone and madcap aliens of the previous ones it feels flat and forced. The magic is gone."
5,Thoroughly Entertaining.,"I refrained from seeing this in the theatres because I simply thought it would stink. I had no choices in Red Box one night so I got it. I put it in and was loving it! The aliens are funny, creepy and disgusting and the plot works for the movie. Tommy Lee looks ancient but his younger self played by Josh Brolin is amazingly done. If you liked the first two, you will love this one as well. Obviously if you get anal about the whole time travel thing, there are errors....but who cares! This is one fun movie!"
4,what you would expect,It doesn't disappoint you but its more of the same..I saw it by streaming on AmazonPrime. That was great and convenient!
4,Long in the tooth,It was the normal MIB gig. There was one exception and that happened towards the end when it was learned that there was a very special relationship between 'J' & 'K'.
4,"Fun movie, except for some moments",I enjoyed the movie but my husband was not into it due to some of the parts being too emotional and not enough action. I do think the first two MIB movies were better but this one still was better than most choices out there these days.
5,Another great MIB,This is just as great as the 1st 2 MIB's. We love it. Plus it finshes our MIB collection. Until they make another.
5,Men in Black 3 (Three Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD...,"5 stars because of what it is.Shipped to me very fast.Packaging was great.love the movie.Came with dvd, blue-ray dvd, and blue-ray 3D(You supply Glasses and HDTV), plus digital copy. very cool.Was a gift, Perfect, Happy receiver.Thank you to seller."
2,Men in Black 3,Not as entertaining as the earlier versions. Sometimes movie producers will just throw anything together and plunk the successfull title on. Figuring earlier viewers will again be entranced.
3,Not as good...,"1 and 2 were much better, I liked the story line but Will failed to deliver. The excitement just wasn't there."
3,Love the men in black,This movie is not as good as the first but still very enjoyable. The story was good and the ending sastisfying.
3,Brolin is excellent,"The best part of this movie is Josh Brolin. He is bang on sounding and acting like Tommy Lee Jones.As a third installment in the MIB franchise, the plotting is getting old. The aliens were great fun in the first movie, but by this one is all a bit oh hum. But still in all, if you want a big of fun escape, this is a decent choice if you like the other MIB movies."
5,great,I was very impressed with how quickly my purchase was shipped. It was still in the original package as specified. I was very happy to receive this movie so quickly. It's a good movie.
4,Men in Black 3(2012),"Men in Black 3(2012) is a good sequel. Agent J(Will Smith) travels back to the year 1969 to stop Boris The Animal from killing Agent K(Tommy Lee Jones). Josh Brolin played a young Agent K for most of the film. The scenes in 1969 feel like a Mad Men episode. There are some plot holes and the theme song by Pitbull is a little bland. The Men in Black movies have a lighter tone than the Men in Black comic books created by Lowell Cunningham. In the comic books, the Men in Black killed innocent people, fought werewolves, and Agent J was a white, Caucasian man! Men in Black 3 is worth watching with some popcorn, candy, and soft drinks."
2,Lacking Pace and Humor of the First Two,"My nephews and I are big fans of the Men In Black films, at least the first two. We were a bit disappointed at this third one. We missed it at the theaters so we were anxious for the DVD release.Besides being thoroughly grossed out a couple of times and tempted to shut it off and switch to something else, we stayed with it to the end. We struggled to stay connected to the film throughout, however. There was a lot more dialog and the witty comebacks between the main characters just seemed to fall short of their mark. The actors were excellent and did their best, but this version was a bit of a disappointment. There was action, but the tempo or pace of the film seemed off. The special effects were incredible, as expected.We'll be adding the DVD to our permanent collection as we already have the other two, but I don't see it getting watched a lot in the future."
3,not as good as precious 1 & 2,"Not written as good as first two. Seems to lag, good special effects, Actors just seemed tired of it all. What happened to Rip Torn?"
4,Very fun movie,"It's better than MIB2, i think. Josh Brlolin plays an excellent young Agent K.It was pretty cool how the film maker connected K's past and J's past."
2,Little Disappointed,Will Smith is always great...but this sequel wasn't a good as the first two...it's okay to watch but not to purchase.
5,good as other 2,I really liked the movie. I bought it for my nephew. It was a Christmas present. he was really happy.
3,Kind of expected more to it,"Its a good watch if you liked the other movies but it's not as good as the others. I was expecting a little more to it, especially with the end and him coming back to the future."
3,so-so,"Definitely better than the second movie, but not as good as the first. Quality was OK streaming, no interruptions at all."
4,Josh brolin,Josh brolin totally made this movie as a young agent k. Story plot okay nothing spectacular. Really just a fun no-brainer.
3,men in black 3,I can honestly say that my favorite was MIB 1. This one was a little bit of the same but not as moving.
3,Entertaining and enjoyable,"A movie for MIB fans, it tries to answer some questions about MIB history, a pretty good movie, good family movie with a pretty good story."
3,Fair to Middlin,"This rendiition of MIB had too much of a soap opera effect. Earlier MIBs were kinky and funny. This one was too serious with too much personal stuff going on. So, I was mildly disappointed. But I remain a fan of MIB out of loyalty."
3,Good alien fun,"Men in Black 3 is a step up over MiB 2 and is a fun ride. It's well worth a watch and an escape for a few hours but don't expect cinematic genus, just good fun alien action - which if you know anything about the MiB series that's all you should be expecting."
2,Pretty lame,"Wow - this was a real disappointment. All gee-whiz special effects, crude violence and rapid-fire but curiously lifeless dialog, lots of uninvolving would-be crisp banter. This film had no emotional core, no compelling plot and nothing really mind-blowing or even mildly thought-provoking, at least nothing to compare to the freshness of the first two MIB flicks. I suspect many scenes looked awesome in 3D -- I saw it on a regular old DVD and thought it was pretty lame. (Axton)"
4,only if its in 3D release...?,Good Fun at the Cinema in 3D.....? If comes out in 3D I will buy it.....? Seems this one at the moment is not in 3D.....?
5,"""It's just Boris.""","I love the Men in Black movies and MIB3 is my favorite so far.Time travel, saving the world, back story...it's all in this one.Josh Brolin does a fab job at playing a young Tommy Lee Jones. Tommy Lee Jones does a great job at playing himself. Will Smith is cool and gorgeous, as always. Jeanine Clement as Boris the Animal is the BEST bad guy so far. And I loved Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin, the all-knowing alien.Wonderful special effects, creepy/slimy/out-of-this-world aliens and just an all-around fun movie."
2,"MIB 1 AND 2 WERE GREAT & FUNNY,THIS NUMBER 3 IS DISAPOINTING...","Poor story line,not funny like the earlier #1 and #2..missing the point..Acting is poor.Poor story line..boring..Where is the pug??It made the show..."
4,Funny!,Will Smith is such a good comic actor! My whole family really enjoyed it. Clever premise involving parellel time realities.
4,I have enjoyed all of these movies.,"The first M.I.B. has got to be one of my all time favorites. This was at least as good as the 2nd, if not better."
1,Men in Black 3,"Never got to preview the movie! Streaming waswhat you could say was less then Desirable! POOR QUALITY! If I could have seen movie, then I could have evaluated it!"
1,froze up could not watch it,After I downloaded it it would not play after one mini.will not download a nother movie again. Ruined my nite.
2,MIB III,"Once again I received a movie from Amazon with the 100% USELESS ultraviolet download. Hopefully one of these days, I will get sick enough of getting this garbage and just stop buying movies."
3,MIB 3,It was ok something to watch once and enjoy but only once. The first was the best and it has been down hill ever since.
5,Men In Black 3,"Men In Black 3 so funny I love them all! Great ""back in time - to show how things began"" type of movie."
4,Good movie,"I heard this movie was not as good as the previous ones, but after watching it, I liked it. My 10 year old thought it was funny. Good choice for movie night."
4,Funny Followup,An adequate sequel. Brolin is an inspired choice to play the younger Agent K. Nice little twist is waiting for anyone who hasn't seen this one.
5,Men in Black 3,Be a fan since the first one. Just had to have it. Are you kidding! Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones the best combination ever!!
2,Pretty bad.,NOBODY liked it ! Bring back ALL the regular cast! EVERYONES' acting was TERRIBLE and YUK! Waste of anyones' money!
2,so-so plot,an example of why most sequels don't live up to the original. the underlying plot seemed a bit forced. Josh Brolin did a good job--not so much for the other two stars.
3,not as good as the others,i was bored quite a few times during the movie. wasnt as exciting and the spectacular effects just were not there
2,BOOOOORING!,"Not much actions. The worst MIB ever! My wife fell asleep and I almost did but since I took a nap in the afternoon, I was able to stay awake and determine not to waste my $3.99 rental fee. The commercials only show the nice part of the movie. I probably watched this movie even if there are many negative reviews since other two MIB were nice. Baite and Switch"
3,MIB 3 3D,This movie is solid entertainment for youngsters from 7/12 years of age.The 3D is good.Am a senior. Found the flick amusing. Bought because of addiction to 3D film making.It was not boring.The disc is well engineered.
3,Another Men in Black,"Just like previous versions. Geared for young people, fell asleep before the ending.Gave it three stars for graphics and special efffects."
3,"not bad, but . . .","It's not that this was a bad film. It was just okay, and not something you tell all your friends about. I did like it, it's just that 1 & 2 were better."
4,Great MIB Movie,Loved the movie and it did the other two justice. Love the actor as the younger K. I have been a fan of all the MIB movies and this one is well made and tied in with the others. I would recommend this movie and especially for those who like MIB. Well done!
4,MIB 3 Fun Sequel,"Really fun plot and characters, good action sequences. Better than average sequel. The computer generated aspect was very well done."
4,a blast from the past,"It was an awesome movie as the others but I didn't think as good as the first. The first one was my favorite, but it is good enough for a second watch."
5,MIB III,"Another hit! Awesome, I had to watch it twice it was so good. It was great all the way through, still laughing."
4,Men in Black Again,I love to watch Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones together in a Movie. They both are good Actores. I would go and pay to see this movie again.
3,men in black 3,It was ok. I think the franchise should quit now unless the story line and scripts improve. I would reccomend it only if there is nothing better to watch.
3,Tired and dated,"The previews were great, but those were the only laughs. Obviously they ran out of stories and this edition is a dreary mess. Josh Brolin gets a few small laughs as a younger Tommy Lee Jones, copying his voice inflections well. Too bad there wasn't a story to hang it on."
2,"MIB3, just not as good as the others","While Josh Brolin does a fantactic job of playing the young agent K, MIB3 is just not nearly as good as the last 2. The story is weaker and does not hold up. I wanted to like it as I think the other 2 movies in the series are great, it was just a let down."
4,Very Good!,MIB 3 was very good. It was better than the second and a good way to end the series. It gave some good background information that helped to understand the story of both Agent J & Agent K. Good stuff!
3,I enjoyed it.,This was like an average between the first and second one; I like the first one a lot and I can't remember the second. It was worth renting from Amazon but I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in the movies.
3,Not as good as the first 2 MIB Movies,Was a little disappointed in this 3rd MIB movie. Maybe they should have just stayed with the first 2 MIB movies
3,"Better than #2, can't touch #1","I'll keep this short and sweet for those who are about to push the ""Buy"" button.I was REALLY excited to watch this movie after I heard that it ""might be better than #1"" and ""redeemed MIB2"". One of those two statements is correct.Pros:It's a great family movie.Ties the MIB trilogy together wonderfullyAdds a nice amount of depth to the characters that was lacking in the previous two movies.Made me feel good when it was over.Cons:The aliens are uninventive and really take a backseat to the rest of the movie.Not impressed by ""villain""The CGI is 7/10A new vehicle is introduced, for about 3 minutes of the movieSeverely lacks the comedy of MIB1.Summary: Fans who adore the first movie will be disappointed if they too have heard claims of it being the best of the MIB series. It's a great addition to the series but it honestly could have been more.Final Verdict: You'll watch it once, but that one time view is worth it for MIB fans."
3,MIB 3,it was ok... not as good as the first and second. and WS is getting old!! lol it gets a three star.
3,Good movie but not much action as expected.,Good movie but not much action as expected. Could have been better with some more action scenes. Found it little slow.
1,Amazon Instant videos sucks,Cant rview because after 3 hours of trying and 2 call to cust service cancelled. Wouldnt download even though i have dowloaded before
1,Ultraviolet Digital Copy crap!,"Dont get me wrong, this is the best MIB yet, but never trusted Ultraviolet, but I took chances when it said digital copy on it. Guess what? it didnt work. Now I have a sony account and a (stupid) Ultraviolet account and i couldnt get digital copy on my ipod!"
1,It takes forever to download to my TiVo!!!,"I went ahead and got it at Red Box - after waiting for 2 hrs! And getting 21 minutes downloaded. After watching the Red Box MIB cubed, it is STILL downloading. I want to cancel my order and get my money back!!!!Larry Curtislccurtis@iname.com"
4,just like the others but still well done,"If you liked the two other MIB movies then this one won't diappoint you. there some exelent performances by some of the actors doing one of the other actors in their earlier years. worth checking out and is a winner for the price you pay through the Amazon link. My cable company charges more and still doesn't get newer movies as fast as Amaozon. So pull up a coach, grab a snack, and enjoy....away from the maddening crowds."
4,Still a good movie.,"Even being MIB III, it's still makes for a good story. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are still good together. Throw in Josh Brolin and it comes up another notch."
4,Nice handling of the long gap,"I approached this with trepidation -- long-delayed movie sequels generally do not have a great track record. That said, I liked it a lot, and particularly appreciated how they accommodated the many-year gap in the story. It does tend to be ""the Will Smith show"" to a greater extent than were the earlier installments, but I found that to work out ok. As with the others, a fun supporting cast, with a fine job by Josh Brolin in a challenging role, and great turns by Michael Stuhlbarg and Bill Hader."
2,No funny,This movie was terrible. I loved the first Men In Black but this one was just not as funny. The humor was forced and not natural.
3,OK,"I was a fan of the other Men in Black movies, but was kind of disappointed with this. Not much of a plot and not all that funny. I hope III was the end of the line for Men In Black."
5,Black to the Future,"Couldn't help myself, I mean, Will Smith goes time traveling.The movie was solid, just like MiB2, but I've never been one for time travel movies since most of the time they have to follow the traditional guidelines of ""WoooooOoOOOo, you could chaaaaaaange the futureeeeeeeee.... if you don't do it right."""
4,I love MIB,"This movie was AS great as the first two MIBs, but I still really enjoy watching these actors work together."
3,Entertaining!,Wasn't expecting much for the third in the sequel which made it more entertaining than what I thought it would be. The end was sweet and made me cry!
5,I dug it.,"I didn't have very high expectations when I rented it, but it was actually really entertaining. 5 star on the entertainment scale."
4,Fun,As usual Will Smith is great. This is a fun movie. If you liked the first in this series you will like this one.
4,Much better than I expected!,Characters ageing but great addition to the cast. We really enjoyed the story and did not want the movie to end.
3,"Funny, but linear","This movie had funny parts and was action packed, but it was lacking in a lot of areas. It seems like Will Smith travels back in time only so that Tommy Lee Jones doesn't have to be in the movie very long. The villain is flat and uninteresting. The plot also follows a very linear path with few twists or turns - for the most part, you know where the movie is going and where it will end."
3,Past it's prime,"It wasn't the worst movie I have seen. I think that the franchise should have been killed off before this movie. Tommy Lee just wasn't into it. The sight gags were getting tiresome, as is Smith's performances. Hopefully, there won't be another installment of MIB."
3,Very average,"This is just a movie that did not have to be made , trying to follow on something that is not there. Pretty poorly made the whole plot just not making any sense."
2,Boring.....,"Repetitive, if you've seen the first two, you've seen this one. Slight changes but mostly the same old shtick from the last two"
3,MIB,This movie nowhere near lives up to the first two movies. My explanation is that this movie is a lot of hokey. Personally would not purchase again.
3,Not one I'll buy,"I found the opening of the movie quite stupid. It did get better throughout the movie. However it's probably not one I'll watch again, unless the world ends and I'm the only one that survived and I found a copy of MIB 3."
3,good but not as good as it could hav/should have been,nice story alot of adult language would recomend for adults so sos so so so so so so oh well
3,MIB 3 Continues the tradition,A pleasant and worthwhile way to spend 90 minutes for MIB fans with an especially ironic twist for Will Smith's character.
3,Very disappointed,When a movie has an outstanding legacy that's a big jump. This movie could have been great but it decided to be poignant instead. Is it worth seeing once? You might even love it. But I'm not interested in seeing again let alone buying it. It's not Marley and Me or anything but if I can't enjoy it with my grandkids than I can't enjoy it at all. Grandmas be warned.
1,Big dissapointment,You would think after ten years you might see something new? But no! It's the same effects same punch lines and same story. Will smith does a great job that's really the only positive thing about it
1,What movie did the rest of you see?,"This movie is straight garbage on a sunny sidewalk in Queens in the summer. I went from uneasy to queasy in less time than Will Arnet spent on screen. Anyone entertained by this ought to swing by my place soon, I got a bran muffin making it's way through shortly. Sure Josh Brolin was a nice addition but totally under utilized. Will Smith looked more bored than the plot to be there. His performance rivaled some of the recently arisen on the Walking Dead. Someone thought, ""sure, let's get the band back together one more time"". While the audience thought, ""sure, how bad can it be?"" Well, ladies and gentlemen, Barry Sonnenfeld has stepped up to that challenge. MIB3 makes SyFy originals look good. I mean, have you Sharktopus?"
2,No digital iTunes copy = NO SALE,I can't believe in this day I can not get a movie to watch on my IPAD. Ultra Violet is good with a quick connection but that's it. I might rent it at red box. But for the price of Blue Rays these days this will not be part of my collection.
5,I can really say?,"I have not received the flim yet!, but it looks like it will be a good one. hurry up with the film!"
1,"MEN IN BLACK THREE RENTAL ON AMAZON.COM ""TELEVISION""",The movie was horrible. In no way does it compare with it's previous movies. Also the picture kept stopping and starting up again at strange intervals. I have no idea what caused it but all my equipment is working for everything else. Overall I am extremely dissapointed in the whole thing.
3,It was good,We enjoyed this movie. I however definitely preferred the original Men in Black. We love Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. They are as always hillarious!
3,"Great effects, but kind of flat","First off the first one , MIB was the best, number two was , compared to this? Just ok.The effects and story were pretty good, but TOMMY LEE... he acted like somebody was holding his family hostage in order to force him to make this movie. Its been awhile since I watched it, but theres not much on TV so, give it a watch.Will doesnt look like ""the kid"" anymore so he might need to adapt to a newer (older) character persona.Just my 2 cents..."
3,Not as good as the others,"This movie has its moments when it is exciting and when it is funny. It isn't as good as the other two movies in the series, though. Still, it's better than a lot of movies out there. If you liked the MIB 1 and 2, watch this one too."
3,MIB3,"Better then the second, worse then the first. Tommy mailed this one in, fortunately he isn't in it for too long. The villain was pretty cool."
4,Saved the franchise,Much better than MIB 2. This movie has similar energy and humor as the first men in black. Saved the reputation of the franchise.
2,Trying to contact Amazon....,"I paid to watch Men in Black 3, but half way through the movie it froze up. I checked my internet and everything was fine. The actual server froze. My problem is that I am a loyal customer and I have never experienced any issue before. I don't know if ""cheated"" is the actual term that I would use for this event, but I did not receive what I paid for and that being the movie that I requested and paid for... I would like to see the movie without having to pay for it again. Right is right,.. Right?!?!/"
4,Fun to watch with the family,It was too squirly in the beginning but got better as it progressed. really enjoyed the last half particularly. My 10-year-old son was initially freaked out a bit but then relaxed and enjoyed it.
2,Not as good as the first two,"This release of MIB attempts to develop some human interaction between the two protagonists. However, it's clumsily done and simply not interesting. The attraction of the first two releases was the strange and funny antics of the various aliens, of which there are very few in this release.Glad I didn't pay for this in a theater."
4,Third one is a great finish to the franchise,"A good night cap that wraps up the MiB series. No Rip Torn -- which is too bad. No ""Frank"" the pug either.. The movie scenes are funny. The franchise should close with this one, however, the shark has been jumped."
3,Not bad for a part 3,"Josh Brolin was great as a young Tommy Lee Jones. But the movie was over done with unnecessary special effects, they should have focused on the storyline a little better."
3,Pretty good,Was a little disappointed in the story line and the character played by Josh Brolin. There was a lot of room for a more complex story as this was pretty predictable.
5,"fun, fun, fun!",I love MIB. All of them. Josh Brolin does a superb job playing young J and the plot unwinds nicely. I have watched it twice and will purchase the trilogie when it is available.
2,worst of the 3,"I loved the original, liked the sequel and pretty much fell asleep during this one - kinda sucked in my opinion"
3,Glad they made it....,"Was happy to see the gang back together...even if they are getting older.Movie is interesting, and we do learn something on agent K. The younger version of K acted by Josh...is very entertaining....good acting...lots of fun.I already have the first 2 and this one completes the collection."
4,Men In Black 3,A young and old K. Jump in and enjoy a good time paradox. The movie goes full circle full of humor.
4,A Terrific Entry in the Men in Black Series,"The high point for me in this film is Josh Brolin's amazing impression of Tommy Lee jones as a young man. The computer generated effect are amazing -- from alien effects to a terrific sequence where New York city goes back in time to prehistoric eras and back to the early 70s -- all in an instant. The effects are capped off by a shuttle launch sequence that that was equal to, and possibly surpassed ""Apollo 13."" The dialog in places gets a little touchy-feely, and seems to go on for a bit too long in spots. Men in Black fans will not be disappointed in this one."
5,Me.,I love MIB movies. I love that fact that I could purchase this for less money than at other retailers.
4,Nice wrap up to the series,Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are great as usual. Josh Brolin is right on as the younger K. Nice twist to the story.
3,A waste of time!,"I was totally surprised when I watched this movie, it was the worst movie of the series of all the MIB movies!"
4,Better than we thought it would be,"Kids liked the first two movies and were divided on this one. 15 yr old loved creepy guy; 6 yr old didn't. But outside of him, we all enjoyed film"
4,"Funny, but too much swearing","This was a great movie, but it could have been a perfect one if they had omitted all the foul words. I wouldn't allow my children to watch it because of that. Otherwise, it was another fabulous installment of the series."
4,One of the better in the MIB series,We enjoyed watching the movie as much as our 7 year old! Mr. Brolin surprised us! It was really enjoyable!
3,Teenage grandson likes it,"Usually, I like these kinds of movies, but this one was a little hard to understand the scheme of it."
2,Snore,"The story had a good idea, but it didn't follow through. I think it has the same problem as Terminator 3,4,5,etc... It is a new movie, but nothing new is really happening...save the world from the evil bad guy. I just thought the characters(good/evil) weren't set up to make you root for or against them."
2,Slow start,The chemistry between actors was good. Slow start to the movie had me wanting to turn it off. Glad I waited.
3,Not as good as the first one.,"This is just Hollywood trying to cash in, on the sequel bandwagon. I would just pass on this one. One."
2,"Dull, dull, dull","A tired franchise, just gets worse and worse. I would not bother seeing this, even when it comes to TV or Netflix."
2,Worst MiB,"This is the worst of the MiB series. But I guess when you get to the third of any series that's probably going to happen. The villain in this one is ridiculous. Just bad. I do love Will Smith but even he can't save this one. I would only watch it again if it was free and I was really high, and there was absolutely nothing else."
3,Men in Black 3,The movie Men in Black 3 was not as good as the previous two. There should have been more special effects.
3,The Ending Was the Best Part,I was really expecting to be wowed with this movie. It didn't exactly wow me... but I liked it anyway.
4,true to form,"As we have to go back in time to retrieve Agent K, before the world the saved ends as we know ends... again the MIB save the day. the main villian was lame with goggles, but heart warming with other charectors to make up for it. I can't say it was the best, but I can say it is worth making a MIB 4 over."
4,it ok,it was great but need more to it i loved it but it needed little more things go on i hope you like it i did
4,Almost as good as first movie,Very entertaining. The actor who played K as a young man was excellent. Did not like the beginning scene with the tongue kiss bit.
4,MIB does it again!,"Another delightful and entertaining yarn from the MIB folks. This is for a quiet evening, grab some popcorn, sit back and enjoy!"
3,Good movie,"Brings the story home, with a suprising twist at the end. This series is just good plain fun. Worth a couple of hours to finish-out the story."
5,.........,"This was a good movie, I enjoyed watching it. I would recommend this movie to friends, family, or other people."
2,3D disk inoperative,"The show is great, but the 3D disk was inoperable twice. Finally returned for credit. The 2D version is fine."
3,Classic MIB,"Nice tie up of storyline in this one. Not spectacular, but solid if you like the MIB series. Enjoy from your couch :)"
5,Just as good as the first MIB!,"The original Men in Black was a brilliant, witty film, with astounding effects, fine acting, and a wonderful sense of humor. The second film in the series came close to the original, but the third might even pass it by. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their performances from the first two films, and Josh Brolin puts in a fantastic performance as a young Agent K- he's got all of Hones' mannerisms and speech patterns down, and he even looks like a young Tommy Lee Jones.All the effects and the imaginative creatures that made the first two movies so much fun are still there, and the plot and dialogue are every bit as good as anything in the first two movies. This time, we're looking into the history of the MIB, the history of the 1960s, the space program, and the history of agents J and K as well. This is a delightful movie that will leave you feeling happy and perhaps longing for an MIB 4."
4,Keywest,Men in black is a Great way to spend an afternoon...good movie...hallarious comedy..great family movie....highly recommended for all age groups.
4,A Fun Popcorn Flick,"A good sequel to the prior movies. If you liked them, you'll probably like this one. If not, you'll be disappointed!"
4,three is charmed,"will smith's body language is an art. josh brolin did not copy, he became. great movie, fantastic dialogue. maybe #4?"
2,Fair,"Not as good as the others,It occupied some free time,Fair at best. Don't think I would recommend to anyone asking."
2,MIB it was not,"Just did not have the story and power of the other movies. The zing was missing, that used to be there."
2,Tech in progress...,It's gets really annoying when you can't watch a whole movie without skipping and hd going in and out. I might as well just buy a scratched DVD...for some reason it happens with every movie I get right at the end when stuff gets serious. Movie is great. The tech that I steamed it with...not so much.
3,devolves toward cartoon,"Occasionally some funny, almost charming - if not quite clever enough - dialogue. For the rest, it's a visual one liner devoid of the surprise that buttressed the precedents of this now tired franchise ."
3,Movie was okay,"Enjoyable movie, didn't think the plot was that much different. Almost through to the end, the climax of the whole plot, the movie cut out, I could hear sound, no picture. Backtracked and my Roku had to reset itself. Then we got picture and no sound. Reset again. Finally finished movie but it was very slow."
3,Not as good as MIB 1&2,"The fun went out of the story without Tommy Lee Jones. Don't get me wrong, Josh Brolin did a fine, fine job, but the tone was way too serious for the Franchise."
4,Best Men in Black of all 3!!,"Was much better than I thought it would be, way better than the first two films. Brolin was very good with Smith."
4,movie,I have all the MIB movies and really do enjoy them. Have to watch this one again so I can see all of it without the interuptions
5,Men in Black 3,"Oh I loved it. Much, much better than the second one.The acting was spot on and the effects were great. My only complaint is I wanted them to ride the cycles more. I loved those!"
4,Better than I expected,"Initially, I thought this was going to be a mediocre movie, but I think they did a pretty good job. I thought it was entertaining from start-to-end. If you enjoyed the previous MIB movies, I would encourage you to check this out."
4,"Better than MIB II, Maybe Better than MIB","I reserve 5-star ratings for movies that not only entertain me, but touch me somewhere besides my funny bone or an academic appreciation for it as a piece of art. 4 star ratings, however, will still get me to buy the Blu-Ray, which I did the day after we streamed it from Amazon Prime.We liked the writing, the chemistry of the characters, and especially Josh Brolin's frighteningly accurate take on a young Tommy Lee Jones. I didn't even miss the worms or the bugs from the earlier films. And the 70s sets were so spot-on I kept thinking things like, ""...they must have raided my mother's basement for that TV set..."" I also liked that the writing didn't beat the 70s theme to death--that era was perfectly capable of beating itself to death with no help at all.Just sit back and enjoy the ride..."
2,The first 2 much better,I also felt there were a lot more inappropriate parts for children in this movie then the first 2. My family found this one boring.
4,Okay movie,"Not as good as the first two, but worth it if you like the series. The younger version of k was funny"
3,Okay but not great,there are moments where it is really good but too much time goes by in between them. the plot was not amazing. the actors save it a bit.
4,black is one of my favorite colors.,"mib 3 bluray is fun to watch, with great audio and video - 4.5 / 5lots of laughs and a good storyline, a lot better than part 2 and on par with the firstone.video quality was sharp and vibrant, as well as the soundstage being very clear and wellplayed throughout my entire home theatre area.good addition to your collection."
2,why was this movie made?,"I loved the zaniness of the original Men in Black. The sequel couldn't match the original, but at least had some funny moments. But I just don't get the decision to even make Men in Black 3. It's not as if the world was screaming for a sequel.Indeed, MIB3 lacks the humor of its predecessors. It tries to be a character story about Agent J and Agent K's origins. However, neither character is particularly interesting or worthy of a movie outside the trademark MIB humor. Agent J is just Will Smith being Will Smith, while Agent K is dour and humorless.MIB as a franchise just isn't about compelling characters - it's about alien gags. And MIB3 had surprisingly few aliens or alien humor, outside a bar fight in a Chinese restaurant and the main villain, Boris the Animal. Even the little cigar-shaped aliens only get a cameo.MIB3 is worth watching for fans of MIB, but it's a somewhat pointless end to the trilogy."
2,A poor sequel,"This is really a clunky film. The only mildly amusing part of it is Brolin's spot-on impression of Tommy Lee Jones. Otherwise, give it a pass."
2,Not the high quality humor of the other ones,Not the high quality humor of the other ones. Possibly took itself too seriously. Bad guys were overtly more violent.
3,best of all MIB,not in 3d like i thought however this is a good movie. The movie could have been much better if they stayed in the present
3,"boring story, no action, incomplete characters...","expected much more, getting worse with every sequel...hard to follow the story, charters does not develop, not funny or adventurous"
4,Almost as good as the first men in black movie,Fun to watch. The actor who played the younger K was great and had me thinking this was the young Tomy Lee.The bad guy of the movie was entertaining and I hope they bring him back somehow in a future movie.
4,Par for the course,"Typical of the other MIB movies, this installment is witty and funny. I wish they kept 'Zed' in the story line, but they made it work."
4,Better than expected,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film. I thought because it was the third in the franchise the makers would get sloppy. They did not.
4,Much like the other two,"Good continuation of the series. Not an Oscar contender and not art film but a few good laughs, good characters and a little wit. Good way to spend a lazy evening,"
3,Love it!,If you liked 1 and 2 you will love 3! Same great action and caractors. We bought it for our kidle so we can watch it on long car rides.
3,"Eh, ok","Its kind of a letdown being its the first movie in almost 10 years. It seems like Will Smith was trying to hard to be funny, and kind of came off a bit grumpy. Tommy Lee Jones has a smaller role here and Josh Brolin does a good job with Agent K, however not really that much chemistry between the two. Could of and should of been funnier."
3,PREDICTABLE,"WHAT PLOT? WE DON'T NEED NO STINKING PLOT? THIS ONE LINE AND PEOPLE STILL TALK ABOUT TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE. OF COURSE, THERE WAS A LOT MORE TO STORY TELLING IN THE MOVIE THAN THAT, WHAT DOES THIS FAST FOOD MOVIE HAVE TO REMEMBER?"
2,Time to dump Will Smith and reboot,"This movie wasn't terrible, but Will Smith is sleepwalking through his roles now and just looks old. There was nothing special about this film at all. Smith looked bored and overpaid. The direction and editing was subpar and rushed. It's a terrible shame, but this could be a great franchise with different actors who care, and an exceptional director. What was promising in the first one, has yielded mediocrity in the sequels. Smith has to be to blame. It's such a shame, he was a very good actor in the 90's."
2,Mainstreamed,"Not to say it was terrible, it had funny parts, a decent story, and good acting for the most part; the thing that kept me from enjoying more of it was the incessant subliminal suggestions that are wrought in everything I've seen out of hollywood as of the past few years (more than before anyway). The the spin-off references to esoteric information.. general corniness and unnatural quality of interactions between people.. you can go on about how I should lighten up and it's only a movie, but I enjoy movies w/ thought-provoking themes & substance with at least some metaphoric resemblance to real life.. this is in suit with more of the watered down, 'appeal-to-everyone,' cliche present in much of the media now. I still thought Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, and the rest delivered great performances, and it was entertaining aside from the aforementionables."
3,Great movie,"I really enjoyed this movie, I bought the Men in Black 3 (Two Disc Combo: Blu-ray / DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy), and has great effects, but Will Smith looks so old, the blu ray technology and full hd isn't good for his wrinkled face.The blu ray comes with a shooting gallery game."
1,50 bucks,$50?!!!???? Does Will Smith come with this Blu ray? This is so outrageous. It feels like a test to see what customer are willing to spend on a movie. Wait till it goes on sell.
1,55.99 dollars? are you kidding me?,"55.99 dollars? are you kidding me? This is pure greed, and since this movie is not made of gold, the rating stands based on trying to gouge us consumers."
4,Liked it better than MIB2,"Good movie! Fun, entertaining, and family friendly. We actually liked it better than MIB2, and would give it a score of 7 out of 10."
3,Same old script,"Some of the concepts in this movie are a step above the other two (unlimited possibilities and the like) however the formula is pretty much the same. Brolin does a great job as the younger Tommy Lee - spot on. will was , well...Will he does that - well. Glad I didn't spend the extra bucks but waited for the rental"
3,Same old thing,I expected more out of Will Smith. Maybe they should've paid him more. It wasn't as many laughs as it should've been.
2,Not impressed,"We were not impressed with the movie at all...no wonder it didn't do well in the movie theatre! Will Smith was great, as usual, but even he couldn't pull this movie through!"
3,MIB 3,"Frankly, I thought it a little boring at times. Save it until there is nothing else that you want to see."
2,Not a great followup,"You know what makes MIB great is it's whimsical approach to the sci-fi genre. It doesn't take itself to seriously, but it still has a great story line and lovable, approachable characters. This film seems to have lost all of those elements in an attempt to churn out another money making film for the franchise. But what else is new? Disappointing."
3,Ok movie,It's an ok movie. Not in the class of the previous movies. Seems like they got a little bored and just rushed it together.
4,Enjoyed it.,"I was leery about this movie, but it turned out to very good with a great ending. That's all I'm going to say because I'm afraid I'll give something away."
3,Not as good as number 1,"MIB 3 was OK, but definately not as good as the first one. It lacked substance and character if you ask me. Enjoyable, but not great!"
2,"Slow starting, cliched, formulaic limps to an end",The bug had more character. I was ready to turn it off at the restaurant. only the fish kept things going. about 30 minutes in one is either inured to how weak the writing is or it gets good enough to watch till the end. in some respects it is typical III of a series. the only thing keeping it going up to the weak end was the almost snappy patter of K and J. why O was even there is a mystery. Unlike I which is rewatchable at intervals or II which is significantly less rewatchable than I. I doubt I'll revisit III a IInd time.
3,MIB 3,"If you enjoyed the first 2 issues of this movie, you might find this version more of the same. The movie holds no surpises until the end when you find out how J and K became partners and why."
3,Should have quit after 2,Like most sequels this one has pretty much hashed and rehashed all there is to do on this subject. Move on.
4,Almost,"Almost as good as the original , i can see another episode coming later.the ending is interesting and kinda sad."
5,Best one in the series!,"Best one in the series! I rented on Amazon, then just bought it because I knew we would be watching it a lot!"
5,mib 3,"well mib 3 was and is a hit tommy lee ,will smith and crew did a great job on mib3 ive watch all 3 3 times now :)"
4,Better than the first two.,"Great movie. It was a lot like the other movies, but we enjoyed it and we are sure that you will too."
5,Full story,"Brings the whole story full circle. Really very touching, lots of action. Lots of fun. You really get more depth."
5,As good as the first,"It's a shame it took them this long to make a MIB as good as the first, but at least they did."
4,Good Entertainment,"If you're looking for some good entertainment for a little while to escape and relax, this is a good movie. It keeps with the whole MIB profile, but does more character development than alien splattering. The wife and I enjoyed it."
2,Silly and Boring,I really wanted to love this movie. The three main actors are so amazing but the story sucks and you can't cover up the stench of a rotten screenplay. Sad.
3,Okay,The movie was okay. I think it could have been better. The villain wasn't that interesting. Predictable ending. Not a favorite Will Smith movie.
4,Nice cohesiveness to the previous two movies!,I really enjoyed the addition of Josh Brolin to this one as he made a perfect young Tommie Lee Jones. Will was great as always!
4,MIB 3-D Did Not Disappoint,Great special effects as usual. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith were great and I enjoyed the addition of Josh Brolin to the storyline. Good entertainment.
4,Different,"This MIB was definetly different than any of the others. It was very unpredictable, sorry to see Zed die, but his replacement was really great!"
2,men in black 3,I was very disappointed in this dvd. I always enjoy Tommy Lee Jones and he was barely even in the movie
4,Good rental,"Really finish's the series well, I like how they relate the past and present to make everything come together to the ending."
5,Good things come in 3's,"Generally speaking sequels get worse with each movie, like riding off the success of the first movie. Not this time. Totally enjoyed each and every MIB movie!"
3,MIB3,Some nice new effects and gadgets. Not of the quality of previous installments. Good to see how J fits into the grand scheme.
3,Not Bad. (not great),"Not as good as Number MIB 1, but better than MIB 2, Tommy lee is looking a bit aged, but as always a flick. A few things that didn't need to be there as kids don't need to see it (alien french kiss). (the director must have wanted to push the envelope, but completely unessisary)"
3,Men in Black 3,It need a little more work. The most important part of the movie was Will Smith character finding out about his father.
2,Third Time's (Not Always) A Charm!,"Some (OK, most!) trilogies are hard-pressed to create a third movie of quality. Heck, sequels are rarely that great. That said, the Men In Black series definitely lost its charm by the third movie. I know that the original should be applauded for it's cheesy humor and weird aliens, but the novelty fades when it's the same ""gimmick"" by the third movie."
2,Going through motions,"This movie was missing the humor and rhythm the first two had. If you loved the first two, maybe watch it, but I would not recommend watching this movie."
3,Entertaining,For some funny Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones this is a good watch for vegging out entertainment with some quirky comics and a good laugh or two.
2,OMG,Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are way to old for this nonsense and look it. Emma Thompson was terrible. Must be her worst movie ever. The plot was sort of interesting. Josh Brolin's imitations of Jones' mannerisms was amusing.
4,Almost as good as the first,The second one was prety bad but this one is almost as good as the first. The characters were excellent but the jokes were not qhite as funny aas the first. Maybe it waas because it is no longer such a unique idea. I would still recommend it aas a weekend rental.
4,A must to add to collection of other 2,"Add this to the triollegy, very funny and intertaining movie. Had to watch it twice to catch some of the stuff i missed from first viewing."
3,Little boring,not as good as MIB 1 & 2 feel asleep half way through movie.would recommend some other SYFy movie. Sorry
4,"A bit ""campy.""","Other reviews, as I recall, indicate this edition stands alone, but unless you have seen at least MIB I, you will not have any background on the development of the relationship between J & K. Being a boomer & growing up on Cocoa Beach during the Apollo days, it brought back a lot of good memories with scenes from Cape Canaveral & 60's rock music, since J has to go back to 1969 to keep a young K from being killed by the alien arch villain Boris the Animal (JUST BORIS!!!) who went back to kill K. I shall say no more tho ... :)"
5,"Wow, who knew...","It's a great conclusion that was a long time coming but worth the wait. Josh Brolin is eerily accurate as a younger TLJ. There were times I actually wondered if it wasn't TLJ doing ADR but no, Josh Brolin's performance is uncanny. It's never distracting and the movie moves forward as it should. It's as good as the other two and, dare I say, has the best ending of them all."
5,Recommend this movie!,I ordered this for a nephew for his Xmas present. He loves this movie. It arrived in perfect condition. Thanks!
5,Best if the series!,"I personally loved Men in Black 3. It was the first one in the entire series that I could relax and just enjoy watching. If you have to see one movie this holiday weekend then see Marvel's The Avengers, If you are going to see two of them then see Men In Black III. It is the best in the series and a solid B+!"
2,Super boring and uninteresting.,JB did a nice job of imitating TLJ but beyond that the movie was flat. My time would have been better spent watching something else.
3,Pretty Good,"I would rate this 3 1/2- almost 4 stars, not sure if it was quite good enough for 4 stars. I think the movie is purposely cheesy, but met my expectations of a MIB movie. Definitely more of a kids movie."
2,Not nearly as good as predecessors,"Very pleased with both MIB 1 and also with MIB 2, I naturally came into this movie with great expectations. Yet after watching it, it turned out to be a bit of a disappointment. Much too much was attempted in the way of special effects, and it felt like the producers were trying to make up for a poor script with overdone scene elements like alien chefs etc. I'm glad I didn't waste good money watching it at a theater."
2,Why I would not recommend movie.,I didn't think it was as good as the first two! Too many unrealistic aliens! I would not and have not recommended this movie to anyone.
3,Entertaining enough,"This was fun, but not spectacular, as the story followed a predictable plot line, and everything moved quickly along to get to the end."
3,Okay film,"Typical of the franchise, but the gags are old and the jokes we have heard already many times.Also, what happened to TL Jones? Did he fight with the makeup crew?"
1,Why bother.,"If you can't make it right, don't do it !!Will Smith has no energy, T.L. Jones's face looks like a rubber mask. Only Josh Brolin shines.Aliens looks so fake and I know they tried to make them look like monsters in 1960's sci-fi movies.But totally backfired in this age of super advanced CG era.. just look ridiculous.Story is boring. Don't bother to watch it."
2,Should have stopped with MIB 2,"Average movie, Tommy Lee Jones looks like he's 90. Josh Brolin and Will Smith were both good. Story was a bit convoluted"
4,Good for a threequel,"Though the storyline was a bit easy to figure out, I liked the connection between J and K. Of course the effects were great as always."
4,Win In Black,"I definitely enjoyed seeing this movie. Now, I have to admit that when I saw this movie in the theater, I had only very recently seen the first movie in the trilogy. I have not yet seen the 2nd one. However, I was still able to legitimately laugh at certain parts of this one. When I go to a movie, I don't usually expect to be blown away by how good or bad a movie is. I didn't really get blown away by this one, but at the same time, I was never anxious to know how much more time was left in the movie. There were a few slightly grotesque things shown, but that's to be expected in a movie like this, considering what happened in the first movie, and the fact that it's a sci-fi movie. The thing that surprised me the most was that there were a few touching scenes sprinkled into it--most notably toward the end of the movie. If you're looking for a somewhat light-hearted, sci-fi comedy, then I highly recommend checking this film out."
4,Will Smith Cool,Good story.. Far better than the last grizzly mess. Will Smith has the ability to reflect the every man and deserves a lot of credit in carrying this off. Brolin was great as usual with his Tommy Lee rendition and Tommy Lee is always cool.
5,Men n Black 3,The movie was funny yet a little suspenseful. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones were terrific. I would like to see it again.
3,Aliens are among us,"In this 3rd installment of this documentary series about aliens and the humans who corral them, we get a glimpse of how it all began."
2,Doesn't live up to the the first two MIBs,I liked the story line but it falls short of the excitment and pace of the first two....Worth a watch but not a keeper...
2,just didn't like it.,the series should have stopped at one! Only rented it because there was nothing else. I might have to find a new form of entertainment if this is what is the future of Hollywood.
4,Just ok.,"Typical Men in Black,. Characters are atrocious. Storyline is unbelievable for those of us not good with our imaginations. Probaby they've made enough Men in Black movies."
3,Basic Entertainment,It was entertaining enough that I didn't feel that I wasted two hours of my life. Not even close to being as good as the first one.
4,Better of all the men and black,I actually enjoyed watching this movie and would watch it again good action and finishes the story very well must see
5,very funny.,i own all these movies and love every one of them. love the sense of humor of these charactors. i like will smith anyway. these movies are a must have. i am gifting this.
4,Men i Black III,"It was good, but not as good as the earlier ones. Maybe a little more like a video game than a movie. I was glad I watched it, though."
4,Better than the reviews,"I liked it and thought it was a nice wrap up to the franchise, if you can call it that. Good spirit to the movie."
4,A surprise to watch,Now out of all the movies that came out this year i was really shocked to see that this one was much better than I thought. I had low expectations for this movie but it turned out to be really good. Will was funny in it actually much better than that lame ass last sequel. Tommy Lee wasn't in this one as much but Josh Brolin really did his thing to play a young Tommy Lee. Him and Will definitely made the movie worth while. I will pick this one up on blu ray upon its release.
4,As good or better than the last movies,"This movie was great. Tommy Lee Jones is in the movie, but he not in there for long as his past character self is now played by Josh Brolin. Brolin does a awesome job and brings a new life to Agent K character. Will Smith is as funny as ever and makes his character's Agent J great. The story is what really makes this movie good. The special effects are there and are used to just helps the story. It answers some questions from the previous movies that people wondered about. I really loved the ending. It was kind of sad, but great at the same time. This movie is well done and worth a buy for some."
2,Not As Good as 1 & 2,Not As Good as 1 & 2 I'm glad I did not see this in the movies and waste my money
5,Men in Black at it's best,"This one was a great surprise. Part one was great, part 2 was good, but part 3 really did a nice job. I sure hope there will be parts 4 and maybe more in the future..."
4,Whole lot better than the last one,"Pretty good. Way better than the last one. I would not buy the DVD, or pay to rent it (I had some free credits from Amazon), but it is worth a couple hours of your life to see it. Had some good chuckles and, as usual, some great special effects. Acting was excellent."
3,Entertaining and enjoyed the story for MIB3,Good movie for amusement. Always little surprises. Love Will &I Tommy Lee. Josh was a believable young K... that is if any of it could be believed.
3,Not as good as the original,"They should have quit while they were ahead.On the other hand, it came with several foreign language soundtracks and subtitles. This, for me, makes it worth watching over and over again.Service from the vendor was excellent. Would order from them again."
4,Men in Black 3,All the Men in Black movies were very enjoyable but I believe this is my favorite. I didn't think it was possible to for a sequel to be as good as the original was this one was geat. I will recommend it to my friends.
4,Better than I though,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was well written, humorous, and the action was above par. It's not a 'Keeper' like the first but well worth 2 hours of your life to watch."
4,I really liked this movie,My boyfriend and I watched this together. We have very different taste in movies and we both enjoyed this movie. I really enjoyed getting to know K's character a little better. Very funny movies as well.
3,"Okay, but nothing special",Dragged a little and not as spontaneous as the other two. Predictable except the ending where J is the son of someone killed by aliens.
2,MIB 3D not good,"The 1st half of this 3D MIB movies was very good but then the 2nd half of the 3D became blurry for all but the maybe last 15 minutes of the movie. Since the 3D blu-ray disc played it is not a disc issue but a quality control issue! If they could get the 1st half right, which they did they they should have gotten the 2nd half right as well but they didn't! I would definitely not recommend this unless you want to take a chance & waste your money!"
3,Lackluster,Like many sequel's this one did not live up to the original. It's only worth watching if you have some spare time and you can rent it cheap.
5,Spectacular,The best Men In Black yet!! Loved it. Purchased the rental for my husbands birthday he loved it. Watched it twice. Will definitely purchase the movie!!
3,Missed the Mark,"This movie was Okay... the Young agent K was pretty good, but the old guys obviously phoned this one in.If I hadn't paid to see it, I would have given it a four!"
4,Liked the movie,Would watch again. I like all the men in black movies. Looking foward to the next movie they will probly make.
2,not the best mib,I have watched every MIB movie. This was a disappointment with the special effects. Not as many aliens as in the others. Its not a complete disappointment... But I would just rent this and not make the mistake I did with a purchase of the cd.
3,Men in Black...I guess,"It was OK, not great. I suppose you can't do too much more than has been done in the other movies. It was worth the rental."
4,A Very Fun Movie!!!,This Is A Very Fun Movie If You Have Enjoyed The Men In Black Series.Fun For All.I Enjoyed Watching This Movie.
5,Awesome,Great movie for men in black fans. Cast was great effects were great. All around awesome movie. We loved it.
4,Good movie,Better than MIB 2. Great story this time. Would watch this movie again with some friends next time. That is all.
5,Another Winner!,"A good adventure with our double secret agents. Tommy Lee Jones got a cameo, as did Emma Thompson. Both were great, and Josh Brolin pulled off the younger version of Tommy Lee. (Sorry, I get their names mixed up, Agent K, Agent J, and Agent O.) Story was a lot different than the previous two films, but played with time travel and other things which would be spoilers here. Worth the price to have a DVD at home. Be sure you get the right version when you order, plain DVD or BluRay, or whatever else. Remember, if it's too cheap, you may be getting something you don't want. Happy viewing."
2,Worst of the 3...,The whole movie just seemed stretched on material for the movie. The villain of the movie is one of the worst villains i have experienced in any movie. I enjoyed the other movies and actually wanted to see this one but was really disappointed. Would not watch again or recommend anyone waste their money on even a rental.
4,"good movie, special effect were GREAT","Good movie. If you have enjoyed the other 2; this one is more a background story. Not as many cool aliens. But LOTS of GREAT special effects. Pop some popcorn, grab your 4-D glasses and hit the couch, it's a fun movie. The ending explains everything."
3,Same old story,"Not thrilled with this movie, seen it all before. I did enjoy Josh Brolin but otherwise it was pretty lame."
4,Great Movie!,"It was a great movie, but I'm a sucker for time travel movies. I'd highly recommend it. Don't have a player to watch the 3D Disk yet, but hoping I'll get one soon."
2,Are you kidding me?!,"This was a disappointment. The only good part is the ending. Acting is just above mediocre, foul language comes around a number of times. Not recommended."
3,MIB 3,OK...the first is always the best...LIked the Brolin playing the younger Jones character.Resolution streaming from Amazon site was definitely not as high definition as I get fromNetflix. Movie was certainly entertaining and had fun watching it.
4,Cute Movie,"I rented this movie via Amazon Prime on a Roku device. I was pleased with the process, with the streaming, and with the movie. I will do more streaming via Amazon Prime. Having the many titles available out there is a neat feature of Amazon Prime membership."
5,I'll watch again someday...,"Great movie! Just as good as the first one. Agent J travels in time to MIB's early years in the 1960s, to stop an alien from assassinating his friend Agent K and changing history."
5,III fills in the blanks,Tommy Lee Jones and the gang how can you go wrong. Good entertainment and brings together some loose ends from I & II.
4,watch it on vizio bluray player,The website had bad connection error with my blueray dvd player unable to watch the movie. but did not know that I had to shut off my firewall on my dsl modem.
3,Disappointed,Tommy Lee Jones is only in the beginning and the end. The movie was too slow. Did not like it.
3,I like Will and Tommy Lee,"I like Will and Tommy Lee, or this would have gotten two stale stars instead of three. But it kept the kids quiet..."
3,fun for the whole family,"This film would work for a family movie night. The kids will love it and if you enjoyed the previous films and were waiting to see if they'd make another... well... maybe it's not the best of the three, but it was fun to see the world of the MIB again."
3,"The first part was great, the second one was so-so. This one needs something more than 3D.","The first part was great, the second one was so-so. This one needs something more than 3D.I've wasted both my time and money on this one."
3,not the best,it is not the best of the three movies but it had its funny moments. I like Will Smith but this seemed slow
3,ok movie,ok acting--not by the bad guy. wish tommy lee jones was in it more. three stars. Wasn't like the first or second.
3,Men in Black 3 is a fun one to see,"I just finished watching Men in Black 3 and for the most part I enjoyed it.Josh Brolin portrayal of a younger K was incredible and right on target.It had some good humor sprinkled through out the action, and this one had more of a human touch to it. I thought the bad alien was not up to par and just nothing to write home about compared to past outings. At times the story slowed down a bit but by the end credits it won me over."
2,Disappointed,"I saw this movie in the theater and won't buy the 3d version. The acting is above average. However, the plot is simple, so there are many unnecessary scenes and dialogue. I had a hard time sitting through the whole movie."
1,Couldn't watch the end,There were so many interruption in the streaming that I was never able to finish the movie. I tried to go on line to contact Amazon about this issue and could not find a user friendly way to correct the problem. I like I paid for nothing.
1,couldn't watch it withou pausing,i can't comment on the movie because amazon.com wasn't able to play it without pausing and having to rebuffer. i had to go rent and watch using the same method on iTunes.
3,"It wasn't bad, just more of the same","...just more of the same. Tommy Lee sure is getting old (thank God for Broslin). Frankly, though, Jones is one of my favorite actors."
4,fun movie,good funny movie.love all men in black movies.too bad im a bad typist i would write a better review.done.wish i never did this now
2,Not funny.. and ADHD..,"Unlike the previous installments, this was too long in the making, and it was obvious..Adderall or Dexidrine will help with finishing..On the plus side, Josh Brolin looked great! ;)"
3,Time to retire this series,"If you haven't seen the other two you won't get some of the references in this one, but for fans of this series they should be okay. Some of the same old tired ideas keep popping up. If you like knowing what going to know how things are going to come out without many twists then this ones for you."
2,Hate to do this to Will,The third attempt puts this one in third place behind just barely 2. There is a twist at the end that almost saves this movie to a 3 star. I think this series has run its course....what do I know?
3,Good but a step down from previous ones,"I enjoyed MIB3, but overall it was down a step from the previous. I can watch the original MIB over and over and still enjoy it. MIB2 I also still enjoy, has several things going for it. MIB3, meh. I bought so will watch again sometime, but it was marginally enjoyable and not overly interesting.A lot of it was somewhat predictable, it wasn't as funny and the new K was kind of boring."
3,Didn't live up to the first two.,I was disappointed as the antagonist was just annoying! He shouted...a lot! I loved 1 and 2 and was hoping for the same in 3. I would suggest you rent it first before purchasing this one. Good luck!
4,Men in Black 3,My husband and I both enjoyed the movie. I thought Josh Brolin was PERFECT as a young Tommy Lee Jones. He had his voice and facial features down pat :) The movie was VERY entertaining and I would recommend it to everyone.
4,good movie,"a bit on the dry side with the humor, could have played it up a little more. Needed more action."
4,Fun Entertainment,"These movies are humorous and worth the money. Although I'm not a Will Smith fan I can tolerate him if the movie is good enough, and some of his one-liners were zingers. The casting and acting of Josh Brolin was brilliant; now him I like. The ending did take me by surprise and improved my overall opinion of the movie."
5,Best one yet.,"Literally, this is one of the best movies in the past year. I was expecting something just sort of fun and easy to watch. But was not prepared for the writers to close the book on the characters in such a way that if you were not moved at least a little, you may not have a brain in your head. Great movie... would recommend."
3,Kinda of disappointed.,"I love the the first two MIB movies, they were great! Full of of lots of action and very good storylines. This, however, wasn't all that good. I thought the storyline was blah! Had some low budget looking monters and was just kinda of boring."
4,One of the better sequels I've seen,Typical MIB story line with a time travel twist. It was much better than other movie sequels that have come out.
3,Okay Movie,"Based on my own opinion, I thought the movie was okay but not as good as the first two. However, I liked the story behind it with a tremendous ending, and one I did like. The Seller sent this movie to me in excellent condition and in a timely manner. Would purchase from this Seller again if the occasion arose."
4,Solid,"MIB 3 does something that man sequels leave out, it actually adds some character development. It's a fun ride and on par with MiB1."
5,Great movie,Good movie...always loved the MIB franchise! Miss the pug and Agent Zed! Great special effects! Good family movie...enjoyed the dude from Flight of the Concords as the badie!
5,Great movie,Seen the commercials and had to see it the comedy lived it to what was expected. This movie made the trilogy !
4,great family movie,"MIB 3 is a little different from the others, it could have been better but I was not totally disappointed."
1,"if you've seen the first and second MIB, then you've already seen MIB III.","this movie was a big yawn. nothing new: fight aliens, chase aliens, catch aliens, save the world. dont even bother."
4,Love MIB,"I love all the MIB movies, and this is no exception. MIB 3 has less action Amsterdam more story than the other two- but a great watch."
3,Not the Original,"This is the third MIB and it has been down hill since the second. I would get 5 stars to the first , 4 stars to the second and this one barely 3. I don't think there will be a 4."
4,Very good,I like they way they start the movie and how they tie the rest. Fun to watch and with great graphics.
4,Along the lines of the fist 2,"About the same masterial as the fist 2 movies with a little bit of time travel twist. Josh Brolin does a great job portraying a younger Tommy Lee Jones, I almost forgot they weren't the same people. :)"
2,Was Disappointed,"I chose to rent before buying; and am I ever glad that I did. I loved MIB; not MIBII, and for me the only saving grace for the third installment was Josh Brolin. No one else could have portrayed a young Tommy Lee Jones with what appeared to be such ease.The story line could have been stronger; and I have to ask why did they cast Emma Thompson?As others have stated, Will Smith certainly could have used more sass; and it seemed to me that even the aliens were old and tired, I can't imagine that these men needed the salaries they were paid; so why did they not insist upon a better production.I may watch it again, as they offer 48 hour rental, but as it stands now I'd have to say, watch the trailer; it containes the best scenes and most laughs."
2,boring,"I loved the first two MIB's, but this one didn't hold a candle to those. It was slow and boring"
2,Too Silly for me,This may not be fair if you like this kind of movie or the previous MIB movings. Simply too silly for me. Will Smith one liners were saving grace.
3,"Too Little, Too Late","Had this sequel to Men In Black 1 & 2 been made about a decade ago I might have found myself more invested. Even with decent acting, a solid script and an overall entertaining feeling, I just couldn't bring myself to care. The time travel stuff was interesting, but frankly I didn't care that much. I hadn't seen the first two movies since they first came out and am not that interested in it. Will Smith is too old to be playing this character anymore and Josh Brolin was the ONLY reason to watch for me."
2,goood,movie was nice but not to be viewed on the big screen. ending is a little bit lame. thoug new k does look like the old k
5,I love it,I bought this movie because I like the first two and was somewhat disappointed by this one. I think they could have put more sass for Will Smith it just made it seem like he was tired of the movie before it got good. It answered alot of questions about the way the charater K is the way he is. I love any movie that has Tommy Lee Jones in it!!
4,Men in Black 3,i saw this in theatres. it was a good movie. a little confusing with the TIME TRAVEL story.but it was still good
5,Awesome,"Great movie!!!! I still like the first one best, but this one was really good. I'd watch again for sure!"
4,New Twist,"I am a fan of Men in Black. I find it is interesting that there could be some truth to the movie contents. I thught the first series was 5 stars. I still enjoy watching the original Men in Black. This one has a suprising twist at the end that took me by complete surprise. I also like the time travel thoroughness. But why I couldn't give it 5 Star because a lot ot it was the same old action and characters. I hope this series continues. If you like the original Men in Black, you will like this one."
4,Entertaining,"enjoyed this movie. it was really fun to watch, I recommend this movie for the whole family.....Awesome effects and a good story line."
4,MIB3,"Great movie that's funny, exciting, suspenseful and heart warming all wrapped up in a sci-fi package... What are you waiting for? Rent it and see for yourself."
2,"Flat. No passion, gusto.","Liked the first as dialogue was sharp, witty, plot moved along and special effects good and film had some life in it, some snap. This one does not have much of anything. Feels like scrips ere read and that is it. Poor excuse for a sequel."
3,Worth seeing,If only for how hilarious Josh Brolin deadpans the younger Tommy Lee Jones. Action is only so-so. Will Smith uninspired. Villain very weak
4,Good but hopefully the last,MIB has hopefully seen it's last chapter in the franchise. I loved the first 2 and I liked this one as well but it felt tired. The same jokes and considerably more exaggerated takes on the characters. Jemaine Clement however saved this movie from 3 stars for me. He was perfect as the bad guy and has that campy feel that makes the MIB movies so good
5,MIB3,This was a very funny movie. I personally think it's the best Men In Black that has been released. I hope they make more of them.
4,Good addition to the legacy,"Good addition to the legacy. I liked it. Good plot, acting, concept. Not my favorite of the bunch but I'd recommend it."
4,Men in Black3,I just love Will Smith and all his movies are great. Enjoyed the MIB series and always want to see more. Hope there is another one soon.
4,Good Movie,It was a good sequel with a good story line and great action. If you saw the first two see this one
5,Want To Buy The Movie But Boycotting Ultraviolet!,"This movie trilogy is one of my favorites! I want to buy this movie, but I hate Ultraviolet digital copy. I do not wish to encourage any more titles with ultraviolet only. I will buy titles that include an iTunes copy. The first reason is that not all places have high speed Internet. There is no way that I can watch a movie on my sorry Verizon 3G. Impossible.Universal,You have no idea how much money you are losing by forcing Ultraviolet digital copy on the consumer. Just thought I would show you one sale that you lost.In conclusion, this movie was one of my favorites this year. It would look amazing on my 3d TV! I will just have to watch The Avengers 3d instead."
5,Men in Black 3,"This is a gift, so I can't rate the movie it self, but did come within a week after release."
3,Previous Sequels better.,"My family and I always enjoy the MIB movies, so we had to watch MIB3 of course.In watching it two times, I got really sleepy on both occasions which is really unusual. I found there to be about 30-45 minutes of material that was just boring and disappointing.If this is a must have on your library list, you might want to rent it first and save some money. I own the first two, but I don't think I will buy this one on disk until it's on sale for $5."
1,stupid,This was a dumb movie. I did not like it at all. I did not even finish watching it. It was a waste of time.
2,MIB-3,It was just alright. Better than TV reruns. Brolin did a great job of being the young agent K. That was the best thing about it.
3,More of the same,"If you want to know about Men In Black 3, just replay Men In Black 1 in your head, tack on a ""touching"" ending - and there you have it."
4,One of the best MIB films,Really enjoyed this. Didn't have high expectations that MIB could pull it off another time but they did a very good job.
4,LOL,"What can I say? This movie is so far out there, it takes your imagination for a ride and brings it back questioning its own sanity by the end. lol I can't wait for more M.I.B. movies if there are going to be more."
1,RCA RP5400,"I first time I used the alarm, it was so loud I flew out of bed. It was not that loud when I set it the night before. So, after many attempts of trying to control the volume for the alarm, the next morning I didn't hear the alarm at all! Never woke up, was late for work. I spent an hour turning the knob up then turning it down and there is not a gradual increase or decrease in sound. So, after two weeks of playing with the volume control, it's going back! I have had enough."
1,Disappointed!,"Purchased this product because we were looking for an inexpensive no bells, no whistles, DUAL alarm clock. Plugged it in when it arrived and it didn't work. Fortunately Amazon makes it almost effortless to return items, so five-star to them for customer service!"
2,Bad radio,"The radio dial was not very sensitive. It was very difficult to tune into a station, and the reception was poor."
4,As Expected,"I bought this clock/radio because it is the model they had in a hotel during my stay. I liked the gradu-wake alarm (the volume comes up slowly). I find that I wake up more natually. My old alarm clock would jar me awake.I also like that it has two alarms that can be used individually or together, and I like the dimming in the display.The radio function does not work. It worked for a few minutes and then it went to maximum volume with a lot of static, so it's useless as a radio but I don't use it for that anyway, so I'm happy with it."
2,Bad Tuner,"I had to get another alarm clock. The tuning drifted terribly (they haven't improved this in the past 20 years?) and was beastly hard to try to re-tune, because the tuning dial is so small. I gave up on it."
3,Functional - but loud,"A fine basic clock radio/alarm. Like the ""any button"" and variable snooze and the display is nicely legible. But the volume control has a snag -- a tiny adjustment downward takes it from ""too loud"" to cutting off the sound altogether. So it's great if you need a loud jolt to wake up in the morning. Otherwise, you are going to be really grateful for those multiple snooze buttons!"
5,Just what we needed,"Has all the functions we needed and wanted, without unnecessary complicating extras. Particularly, we love the dual alarms, nap function, and that the alarm starts out soft and gets louder. Also, we can see the time from across the room now - we couldn't with our old one. It's simple and not too big. Assuming it continues to work (we've had it about a month), I'd highly recommend it! We have tried fancier clocks of different brands and they always end up unreliable after just a few months (alarm never going off, phantom alarms, numbers unreadable, etc.), so I'm all about cheaper with only the features I want so the additional features don't mess up the rest of the clock. One negative - we put a battery in it, the power went out, and it did not reset itself afterward. But none of our other clocks seemed to either, so I'll still stick with this one."
2,"Love the alarm clock & features, but it died after 3 mos. Bought another and it died 5 mos later.","This alarm clock has two features that I love 1) the nap function, which lets you program the clock for naps in increments of 10 minutes, and 2) the gradually rising alarm buzzer that starts out as a very soft tone and eventually goes into full blast after about 15-20 seconds.The problem with this particular unit is that it keeps failing! I bought my first one from one of Amazon's resellers and that broke after 3 months. I then got another one from a local store and the LED's started failing one light at a time. Really weird. The radios continue to work on both units, but the lights keep going out.Poor manufacturing is my guess, and I'm out $50."
5,Good Product!,"Finally! I found an alarm with the features I want, and at a low price. This one is a nice size (not too big, not too small), has a ""Nap"" feature, and an ascending alarm tone - all nice attributes for me. The Nap function can be changed from the 20 minute default to 10, or 30, 40, etc. I love this alarm clock!"
5,Smart Clock Radio,The radio is exactly what I needed. The one I had for over 10 years finally wore out and I was having a hard time replacing a similar one in the stores. Thanks for being so prompt in shipping it.
5,LOOK NO FURTHER,"If you are reading this review, you may have already spent hours looking for a mysteriously elusive product: the decent clock radio. Look no further.I spent months searching for clock radio that would fit my (seemingly simple) needs. I finally found this one, put it to the test and am impressed with the results. The product is so good that I'm writing my first-ever review. I hope you find it helpful.Product pros:- numbers are big enough to read without glasses- soft green doesn't illuminate the whole bedroom- dimmer switch available- grad-u-wake feature: the only buzzer I've experienced that isn't jarring/ugly- small footprint on the nightstand- programmable nap & snooze durations- dual alarms can both be set to radio or buzzer- adequate radio quality- simple, easy, inexpensiveProduct cons:- noneFinally someone got all the features right. See for yourself! Bonsoir."
2,Distinct pros and cons,"Pros: dual alarm either music or buzzerNice nap featureEasy to setAdjustable brightness of digital displayNice sound when it's coming through clearCons: If you choose the buzzer wakeup option, it's too loudThe knobs to adjust volume, lowest level is too loudIt's not easy to get a clear channel and once you do, it doesn't stay that way.This alarm clock has potential with a few tweaks by the manufacturer.It's probably worth $10."
1,Definitely Avoid This Clock,"I've had this alarm clock for less than 3 months. I absolutely loved this alarm clock until today. I came home and discovered it had froze up with some cryptic symbols that don't even resemble the time. You can push every button and nothing happens, even unplugging it does nothing. I have never heard of a clock freezing up before. But after a little research, it seems a lot of different models of RCA alarm clocks are freezing up like this. This will be the last RCA product I will ever purchase, as I had problems with their other products too."
3,History is inaccurate,"While looking for a book for the Linux+ exam, I stumbled across this book... However I set the book down after reading the first paragraphs of the history of Linux.The book describes Linus Torvalds as the creator of Linux.. which is terribly inaccurate. To set the record straight Linus created the kernel.. thats it! Why does everybody insist on writting Richard Stallman and the FSF out of Linux's history?Anyways, if the book can't get the history right, I doubt it can get the exam questions correct either."
3,Not as easy to use as others,I have two of these in my media cabinet. I'm not sure the brand of the other one but the punch downs on the back made much more sense. This has a confusing color scheme and you have to read the instructions to understand what order the wires go in.I made it happen and it's a quality item but if I had to do it over I'd go with another unit.
5,Great Product,I really liked the product. Fast shipping. Good Quality and looks great once it is assembled.
2,"Shackled Continent, Robert Guest",The book is immature and riddled with inaccurate information and frequent exaggerations. Guest is no doubt an able communicator capturing your imagination but the book has more fiction than facts. One example is his reference to a purported myth supposedly rife in Kenya that any HIV AIDS positive sufferer can get cured by having sexual intercourse with a mad person. I have lived in Kenya all my life and have never heard such foolishness! If he cooks stories about Kenya my guess is that he does the same for other countries.
5,Gorgeous!,"This recording makes for wonderful background music, but it is not background music. It is a very inventive musician exploring the music of a great composer and it deserves close listening. Fred Hersch is an impeccable pianist and Billy Strayhorn's often lush compositions are perfect vehicles for him. The string orchestra under the direction of Eric Stern provides accent and accompaniment without ever becoming instrusive or overwhelming. Everything fits together nicely and every cut is worthwhile. If I had to choose a favorite it would be the beautiful ""Lament for an Orchid."""
3,"Intriguing idea, mediocre ending","The idea of an official Roman investigation into the theft of Jesus' body is a stroke of genius, but the filmmakers flubbed their premise with a boring almost-romance between Taurus and Mrs. Pilate, and a silly end act as Taurus goes undercover as a Jew to find Jesus. Heartfelt but flawed film."
4,It made my Ikea bed sleep-able!,"I just got an Ikea foam mattress. Not way comfortable for me. Felt better in the store. Anyway, I knew I needed some quality foam in between. This one is priced right and it makes my bed sleep-able!!! That's all I asked for.....AND IT WORKS!!!"
4,Love this mattress topper!,"Have had this topper for a few nights and so far, I love it. Made a big difference in my comfort level while I'm sleeping. There was a very strong odor the first night I unwrapped the topper but by the second night the odor was gone. I'm very happy with the purchase and highly recommend it."
4,Not too bad for the price,"I was surprised when I got this thing. It was wrapped in saran wrap like a sleeping bag stuffed into the box it was shipped in. I was expecting an air sealed package where I had to unfold the memory foam and wait 24 hours to use. This unfolded immediately and had very little smell. I'm not sure if I got a used one or not?! For the foam layer itself I feel that it does a pretty good job for the price. It doesn't make me overly hot and it relieves the pressure points from when I sleep on my side. Also the package information says it is cut so that it is smaller that the bed. The one I got is bigger than my queen bed. Not way bigger as if it was for a king bed but big enough to make it a tight fit between the head and foot boards. I got mine for 74.99 and the very next day Amazon dropped the price down to 68, go figure haha."
4,Pleased,"Good quality, happy with the mattress topper. I ordered this for my husband who is temporarily in military housing, and the mattress he has is bare bones basics. The topper makes a big difference and fits the full size mattress well. He's had it for a few weeks and loves it. The strange smell faded out in about 24 hours."
4,great pad!,Great pad. Stopped my back aches right away!! My mattress isnt the softest and this is definitely the cure for that.
4,"Luscious, but may not be good for you...","What a fabulous mattress topper! I gave it to my son and daughter-in-law for their very hard futon (a bed of nails, really). They're in heaven! It transforms the worst mattress into a high quality bed, one that cushions your shoulders, hips and any other sensitive spots while offering excellent support at the same time. There's just one downside: they report that it's mighty hard to peel themselves out of bed in the morning, poor souls. I'm going to order another for my horribly uncomfortable guest bed. With Amazon offering such a great price and speedy delivery for Christmas, who could ask for more?Update - two weeks later: my son and daughter-in-law asked to return this because they've felt groggy and queasy every morning since putting this on their bed. Perhaps it's off-gassing? Allowing the topper to air out thoroughly before using it might help."
4,Good Sleep,"First, this item is priced much better here on Amazon than anywhere else I looked. I have been sleeping on it for 6 months now. It greatly improved the comfort of my mattress. I sleep better. No back ache in the morning. Other reviewers were put off by the odor. I did notice some odor when first opened, but this went away completely in just a few hours. Great product. Recommended."
4,Better than buying a new bed!,Wonderful topper! Its like having a brand new bed for 1/10th of the price. Purchased in March and topper is still like new. I didn't have any problems with any smells when it arrived and it rolled out to full shape in just a few hours. It actually has a nice clean smell and hasn't absorbed any other odors since we took it out of the box. I wasn't sure about the ventilated holes but they are actually really nice since I tend to get very hot when sleeping. Only complaint is that the foam is very delicate. Our dog jumped on the bed once when changing out the sheets and his nails created a small rip in the foam. The rip didn't affect the look or feel of the topper but I was surprised how easily it ripped. No problems or rips when we have the sheets or blankets on the bed-just be careful when the topper is not covered.
5,Best bet!,"We purchased one for our queen bed, earlier this year and love it. It was about half the price as the ones in the stores. There is no plastic odor but a faint minty smell. This was the way to go since we did not want to purchase a new mattress. I recently purchased one for my sons bed. We bought his bed off of C-list, didn't want to pay alot for something he jumps on as much as he sleeps on it. You will not regret buying this, you will feel the difference when you sleep. We also got the waterproof mattress covers on Amazon, and they have really worked great protecting the foam pad."
4,great if youre bed is not in very bad shape,i got this topper to help my old bed because it was giving me lower back pains. It did help but it just wasnt enough to help my old spring mattress.
5,New life for an old mattress,"We purchased this foam topper for a spare bedroom that had a mattress that was considered too firm for most older adults. After putting the topper on, my wife and I slept on it for a couple of nights to give it a try. What a difference! I wouldn't hesitate to offer this bed now to any visitor of any age."
5,I have a new mattress.,It completely changed how my bed feels. This is a great alternative to buying a new mattress. I absolutely love it!
3,Arrived as expected,I think I've got what I paid for. After open and letting it sit in a guest room for about 3 days I found no pronounce/disturbing smell and it got to the size as promised. Width and length is a little shorter than actual sizes but I don't sleep on edges either and those things are reported so it's no surprise. It heats up your body a little bit more than I like but one can try a better sheet. Generally speaking it's relatevely cheap topper and for that it meets my expectations. The only question left how long it would retain its properties for me to calculate it real value.
5,Can't live without this topper!!,Has made such a huge difference to the confort of my bed. I can not live without it. I LOVE it!!! Worth the money. Great on your back and you get a greats nights worth of sleep. Must have product!! Only negative thing is that I have a hard time getting out of bed because its just to darn comfortable.
5,Unbelieveable,"I have only written one other product review in all my years using Amazon, but this product deserves attention. I bought one for me and one for my business partner and we actually leave them in storage at the overseas hotel where we frequently stay. Our three star hotel now feels as good as a five star. The old mattress is irrelevant. I don't think I will ever bother to buy an expensive mattress again because with one of these, you sleep like a baby."
4,memory foam is the best so far,I bought the queen size and it fits just right. It is more comfortable than a regular padded matress cover.
5,Great buy!,I bought this as an overlay for my memory foam mattress that was a little too firm for me. I love it! It made such a difference. It arrived fast. Opened up quick. Fit perfectly on my cal king. Didn't have a chemical smell. Instead had a tea tree oil smell that went away in a couple days. It wasnt bad at all. Very happy wih this purchase.
3,Good mattress but something not good about it,"I got my mattress topper yesterday 4/27/12. I was so exciting. It's very comfortable to sleep on, and I using it by the time I got it. Despite the smell, it was not strong as other reviews. However, I did find out that the mattress topper is less that 2 inch, only 1 3/4. Also yellowish color. Overall, the mattress is fine but hope the seller be honor about the product. Trust and reliable is very important for business."
3,Not a read memory foam topper,"I had a temperpudic, which was much denser, and really was memory foam. This seems to be squishy foam. It's good, but if you are really wanting the actual quality of memory foam, go for the temperpudic. It also seems to hold heat."
3,"It's not the softest of pads, but okay","I've been sleeping on this sucker for a couple of months, so I guess I've figured out what I think of this pad. It's okay, but not great. What I expected was the kind of memory foam that I'm more familiar with, a bit less dense and more yielding. I've got a pillow, for example, that I can easily press in with my fingers and it immediately molds around them. This pad isn't hard or anything, but it's not that soft. When you lay on it it takes a minute for your body to sink into it and it to mold to you, and at that point it's a bit more comfortable, but I still feel a little too much pressure on my shoulders when I lay on my side. It's kind of pleasant to lay on, don't get me wrong-- but I do wish it was a little softer before my weight compressed it. Seems durable, at least."
2,too hard,"I did extensive research on different mattress toppers on Amazon and found that this was the highest rated. I seriously wonder if i received a 2"" topper because it felt really thick and was very hard to lie on. It wasnt as soft as i wanted and it felt almost crispy to sleep. I slept on it for a while in hopes of it getting softer but it wouldnt budge. Sold to someone else instead.. what a disappointment.."
2,Mediocre quality,"I've purchased a number of memory foam mattress toppers over the years, and I'd rate this one as the worst. The foam has very little memory to it, to the point where calling it memory foam really seems like a stretch. It compresses quite easily. Also, the topper is three inches shorter and two inches narrower than my standard-size mattress, which looks pretty bad. Granted, the manufacturer states the dimensions on the product page, so it was my fault for not reading carefully enough and assuming the topper would fit the mattress well. The other two toppers I've had fit their mattresses perfectly."
5,Works great on a cheap mattress,"I put this on the relatively cheap mattress that came with my RV and I now love sleeping in that bed more than my Sleep Number bed at my house. Since the foam typically breaks down faster than the rest of the mattress, I think this is the best way to go. From now on, I'm going to buy less expensive mattresses along with a good quality topper like this one, since it's much less expensive and easier to replace this than the whole mattress."
5,Great option for bad back and tight pockets,"I live in a dorm, and the mattress provided is terrible. My back had been hurting for two months and getting this mattress cover greatly helped. I would recommend this to anyone who has been thinking about improving their sleep quality. The foam smell went away shortly after putting it on the bed."
5,Great after a few days of odor. Worth the hassle..,Strong chemical smell when it was unwrapped. We were ready for this with the reviews so left it in a warm room with the ceiling fan going for 3-4 days. Still a slight smell for another few days after we put it on the bed. Worth all the effort. Great combination with our firm mattress and the size fit our king mattress perfectly. Quality product -- very comfortable.
3,"Works well, but toxic smell","I ordered it for my babies who need comfortable mats at night.It works well and I also feel good, but the smell lasted long (~2 weeks) and it's like toxic.Ventilation is needed to place it inside babies room."
2,Too hot and soft.,"I had this topper on my Sleep Innovations 10"" memory foam mattress. this combination is not good. It gets too hot and also becomes too soft.I hope this review helps somebody."
1,Very uncomfortable,"The memory foam is so cheap that any points of contact on your body will sink all the way to the bottom. I could not sleep at all on this given how uncomfortable it was. It certainly was soft (I also did find it slightly cooler than my previous one) but unless you are able to sleep with half of your body 3 inches lower than the other, do not buy. FYI I am 5'11, 165 pounds, and unless you're significantly smaller, I imagine you will have a similar issue. Amazon was great at processing the return, so worst case scenario you always have that option."
2,Hot and Soft,"This did provide some softness to a firm mattress. However, after sleeping on the pad for a while it trapped the heat and became very hot to sleep on. Once it heats up it also loses a lot of its firmness and smushes right down. I would opt for a pad with a higher density than this pad offers."
3,Not bad but not what it used to be!,I purchased the King size topper last year and it was excellent. I recently purchased another this year and at first they both seemed identical but within a few days you can tell the difference. The foam on the second recent purchase does not have the same consistency and support as the one purchased last year. After Almost a year of use last years purchase is firm and returns back to shape but the current year's batch seems to not have the same feel after only 3 days. I started experiencing some back pain so I moved it to the guest bedroom. For the price I can't really complain too much but if they are claiming this is the same product (3-pound density memory foam) quality control has gone down drastically.Update: Too many aches and pains since I got this one. Only 1 Week and it's going back.
2,Not Memory Foam,"This item is not as described by the seller. It is a very soft, non-supportive foam that does not have the true property of ""memory"" foam. In other words, it does not hold an imprint from pressure and rebound slowly like real memory foam does."
3,wrong size but okay,"I work and live in Afghanistan and the mattresses we have on the bases here are horrible. A bunch of guys have ordered various memory foam things and always say how nice they are. I ordered the ""full"" sized 2"" for just under $75. Amazon shipped me a queen. No big deal because you can just cut about 18"" off and now you have a cushion or whatever. This product definitely makes my bed more comfortable but for about the same price you can get a 3"" thick piece that offers a little more support. If you are heavy this one probably isn't the one you want. All and all it is okay, but like I said for the same money you can get a little bit thicker one. both this one and the 3"" will fit underneath your stretchy bed sheet thing-"
3,LEE,"it smell strange, i don't know how to describe the smell. Otherwise it would be perfect I think. Hope the smell is not anything bad for body."
5,AWESOME!,"I'm very very pleased with the product; was expecting it to arrive in 2 weeks, arrived in 6 days."
4,all I wanted and more...,"My only complaint is that I wasn't accurately notified of when it would arrive. Still, considering it arrived several days before I expected it to, that's hardly a complaint. The pad is very comfortable and smells great, and I couldn't believe how small of a box they fit it into. Well done y'all and many thanks!"
5,Great Investment,"I recently purchased a plush pillow top mattress that turned out to be too soft. I did not want to return the bed as I would lose a couple hundred dollars, so I purchased this topper. I love it! It has made my bed feel more firm and comfortable at the same time. I sleep great now. Worth the money!"
5,very comfy,"This mattress topper is better than I expected. Not only is it yummy comfy but I was surprised to find that I don't really notice any uncomfortable lumps when I change position. They're hardly noticable. Also, it doesn't make me hot but then it's wintertime so the real test will be this summer."
5,Makes a cheap mattress a great one!,This memory form is excellent; it is firm when you first lie down but it molds and supports your body. Excellent way to make a not so great mattress into a great one.
4,Excellent Value,"This was my last chance at saving my new, but firm mattress, from having to be returned. I have found the foam to be very comfortable and supportive, and have used it for nearly three months. You can increase the plush factor by adding a down comforter between the mattress and this foam, or on top of the memory foam, beneath the bed sheet. Needless to say, it has made for very nice restful sleep. I would recommend this to anyone trying to make a mattress less firm or to increase support."
5,Verrrrrry comfortable,"This was our first memory foam topper and it's so comfortable! When we bought it we weren't sure if 2in would be enough, but we both sleep alot better and you can't even feel the indents in our mattress. It was definitely a good investment. So much cheaper then a new mattress! :) I would advise airing it out for at least 48 hours, the chemical smell can be a little overwhelming."
5,Impressed,"I was very impressed with this topper. I searched and searched again wanting to find the perfect topper for my daughters dorm bed. This was it! She actually got the best bed in the dorm award! :)If your looking for comfort, durable, and value, Your search is over!I have just bought two more for my boys beds."
5,Visc02 Review,"Great product at a great price and free shipping, couldn't get any better than Amazon."
3,Expectations were too high,"There really wasn't anything wrong with this item. My expectations, however, were too high. After getting a mattress that was WAY horrible and uncomfortable, I had hoped that this mattress topper would help -- it did -- but not enough. I found it to sleep HOT, sweaty hot, even though it was ventilated. I guess I am just not a memory foam fan. It does give a bit of a pillow top feel to a mattress; however, it just wasn't enough for me."
4,A Nice Addition to a Futon Mattress,"This ""Mattress Enhancer"" is a good addition to a futon mattress, or perhaps an older mattress that might not be as comfortable as before. Note that this is definitely not even close to sufficient to act as a mattress in-and-of itself, although, it is not advertised in that manner. I took a star off because I felt that it was relatively expensive for what it actually is, which is simply 2"" of elastic-foam that probably cost $3 to manufacture. Also, when it first arrives, it definitely has a rubbery-chemical odor, although that eventually goes away. All in all, a pretty good buy if you understand what you are getting."
5,Excellent - Fast Delivery,The seller shipped the mattress pad quickly and it was well worth the money. We will be purchasing addition mattress pads for the rest of the beds in the house.
3,air it out a couple of days,"Does not look pretty when it arrives, but open it up and air ot for three days and it is fine. Has really improved my bed comfort."
2,Not real memory foam,"If you're looking for real memory foam, this isn't it, but it's a nice alternative to memory foam. It would be great if the the mattress top came with its own cover."
5,So Soft!,Bought this to top a queen air mattress. It fits the bed perfectly and makes the most comfortable bed ever. And it doesn't feel hot either. You can't go wrong with this.
2,Vico)2 Memory Foam Topper,"This was a total disappointment. The one Wal-Mart has for $35 has better ""Memory"". This was shrink wrapped to the size of a ""rolled small sleeping bag"" and weighed about the same. Was not the product I expected."
3,Does not compare in comfort to my last memory foam pad,"Sleeping on this is like sleeping on a frozen plank as compared to the sleep I get when sleeping on my memory foam pad from Overstock.com. I did pay over $100 for that one and was trying to cut corners this time. However; since I have Fibromyalgia and back problems, I made a big mistake. I would not recommend this at all. I unfortunately believed all of the good reviews written here, but obviously none of them share the same issues I do with pain. I am glad it works great for so many but here is one dissatisfied customer! Unfortunately my hubby unwrapped it, put it on the bed and threw away the wrappings, so it was here to stay. As soon as I'm able to save up a little extra, I'll be back at the other site to buy a true, soft memory foam pad."
4,good value for the price,"I put this 2 inch topper on my mattress, which is pretty firm. Then I put a regular form-fitted mattress pad on top of that. It makes a nice ""soft"" feel for comfort in sleeping. I actually like the fact that it doesn't have the typical feel of most quality grade of memory foam. This one bounces back more quickly than typical memory foam."
3,Soft and Smelly,"This foam topper does the trick - adds a soft cushion to a hard mattress. I am 7 months pregnant and my extra firm mattress is a little too firm for me right now so got this foam topper for the remainder of my pregnancy. I am sleeping better with the extra cush BUT I have to say the foam really smells. Its scented with what the packaging calls a ""green tea"" sent but it smells more like mint chocolate chip ice cream to me. It's a very strong odor that has not gone away after 48 hours of airing the foam outside in the wind and another week of actually using the thing on the bed. The scent is a major bummer - its tolerable - but its always there and you smell it when you go into the bedroom, when you move at night adjusting the covers, and any other time you are around the thing. Upon further reflection I probably should have gone to some place like company store or garnet hill or some other online retailer that was a little nicer - their foam may not have smelled so much."
3,Stinks to high heaven,This matress top is soooo comfortable but it smells so strong. I woke up this morning with my nose hairs missing. I am hoping the smell will air out in a week or so or else I might need to return it. I read another review that said the same thing about the smell and I should have listened to them.
1,Disappointed,"I thought all Full beds were standard, but this came in a box marked Full and fit more like a twin... I don't know if there was a mistake, but we were not happy with the fit. Waste of money, can't use it."
2,Trap heat,"This pad is only suitable for winter. During summer, it is hard to sleep on it. It traps the heat and even though the temperature is 69F, the pads feel like it is 90F.I definitely would not recommend using this pad during the summer. It does not really help your sleep but you will feel neck and back pain after using it for few weeks."
1,too soft for the back support,i bought this pad because my mattress was a bit old and i didn't want to change it. reading the reviews i decided to give it a try( and i was wrong); after a sleepless night and my back hurting next morning i decided to return it. it was absolutely useless for me since i need a good support for my back and nothing but a firm mattress helps. i never experienced the memory foam before but something tells me that this product has a very low quality...
2,not to bad,Not to bad but i wish i would of got the 3 inch one for the money buy the thicker one. But over all not bad for the price
2,Sold it,"I had it on my bed for less than 2 weeks. My girlfriend bought it from me for 50 bucks just yesterday. I was oddly having breathing problems. Never had that feeling before, doctor said to lose it. Had let it air out for a few days time prior to sleeping, but the mint smell is atrocious. It did fade, and it mostly gone now. My friends 10 year old daughter used it last night, and she loves it."
2,I don't like it,I woke up with a lot of body ache due to this product perhaps because it was too soft and also it is not very ventilated as it will make you sweat. I do not recommend this product.
1,Product - Not as Advertise,"I was really looking forward to getting this product. Unfortunately the product I received was quite different than the product advertised. Similiar to other comments left in 2012, the product is not memory foam.... or at least this foam had no memory, the density as measured by the product weight was also not as advertised. The entire shipping weight was 25% less than advertise. I don't have a way to actually measure the density of this foam, but based on the weight, I do not believe it to be the 3# density as listed.I had read the other recent reviews (2012) and there is a consistent message that the product currently shipping is NOT the product advertised on the Amazon listing. I should have heeded their warnings."
2,Good for 3 months... only,"I loved this foam topper at first. Now, I have had it for 6 months and hate it. I have rotated it several times, however the foam is so soft now that we just sink into it. This did not last nearly as long as other foam toppers I have had in the past. I would not recommend."
3,A mixed review,"I'm giving this three stars because it's the average of the one star I give it and the five stars my wife gives. She finds it pleasantly warm and soft. I find it excessively hot and so form-fitting to my body that it's a bit difficult to roll from my left side to my right. I suspect the difference is body size. I'm six-foot-two, 240 pounds. My wife is a foot shorter and 100 pounds lighter. This would probably be fine for lighter people, but big folks like me might want to consider a denser foam. There is a slight odor for the first three days, but it is minty and inoffensive. It is a near-perfect fit for my queen mattress, although I had to round off the 90-degree corners to match the round corners of my mattress. This is easily done with a pair of scissors."
1,absolutely soft-not a memory foam,"The density of the foam is wrong. This mattress has nothing to do with regular memory foam mattresses. Maybe some people like it because is really soft, but that is not what memory foam mattress should be like and that is not what I was looking for.With the heat of human body the foam changes its density to really, really soft (its like u don't even have mattress underneath you) and you just sink into it. There is definitely no hand as shown on the picture :) maybe, when its cold it's seems like memory foam mattress - but with your body heat it changes immediately to jelly.However, there was not bad smell at all. Morelikely it smells a little bit like green tea.. but only for first days and it was not disturbing."
4,Comfortable but warm,"I've never slept on a mattress pad before, but I have slept on many pillow top mattresses. I didn't have any particular problem that was trying to address with the mattress pad except to extend the life of my current mattress. All in all I think this is a good product. They treat the foam with a green tea scent or something like it, so its nice not to have too much of a chemical smell. I did leave it in my basement for a few days to air out though.Pros: no plastic smell, fits my queen mattress pretty well, can't feel my partner's movement and wiggling when we're sleepingCon: makes the bed feel significantly warmer than before (bad in the summer but good in the winter!)"
3,"""Fresh Foam Odor"" is quite strong","I received this product about a week ago and am still airing it out - it has quite a strong odor (like mint chocolate chip ice cream)which has been overwhelming at times. Other reviewers say that this fades over time - I'm hoping so. Other than the smell, the topper is really great. It is quite comfortable and makes our lumpy mattress quite comfortable!"
3,It's ok. Not great.,"I have lower back pain and bought a hard bed. But it turned out to be too hard for me, who is a side sleeper. To compensate I bought this topper after seeing the 5 star reviews. It will do if you haven't used a better memory foam before. It turned out to be very light and less dense than I expected. After I tried it for a week, I had to return it. IMO it's less dense than it ought to be."
5,Bed saver,"Like a lot of people I have found out that the new mattresses they sell are disposable. NONE of them are made to last. My mattress (a Serta) is less than three years old and already dented in the middle. I've had this foam mattress topper for a week now and I LOVE it! When it arrived, it was rolled tightly, but sprang right up to almost full size for me in about 5 minutes. The smell was hardly noticeable. It is thick and heavily weighted; actually falls back with a thud on the floor! It has kept us from having to replace yet another mattress. I would highly recommend this product to anyone!"
3,worth the price,We got this on sale for around 60 and compared to other toppers Ive used before and paid around 150 for....this is just as good for less than half the price. would recommend again to anyone!
5,Love it.,"I'm very impressed with this mattress enhancer. I purchased it for my girlfriend's queen-sized bed and now I want one for the bed at my apartment. We didn't notice any odor after opening the packaging. We did air it out for one day before using it, but I think it would have been okay to use it the first night. The pad has good density and we've noticed much better sleep and far less achy joints in the morning. We're very happy with this purchase."
4,Comfy,We bought this product for a travel trailer and it is very comfortable. The only problem at all is I have a hard time rolling over on it. Everything else is great so far.
5,Keeps my guests comfortable on sofa sleeper,I added this memory foam as an added layer to my guests sofa sleeper. Believe me that there is no sofa sleeper comfortable as a bed but this topper helps make it a close second.
4,Great Value,I like this mattress cover and it is a great value. I let it outgas for two days even though it did not really need it. Sleeps great.
5,Great Purchase!,"I ordered the Twin XL memory foam mattress enhancer for college and I'm so happy that I did. It was first of all a great deal for such a quality item, and it fit perfectly on my bed. It's extremely comfortable and has helped me sleep a lot better than my bed at home ha! I highly recommend it anyone who wants more cushion for their bed."
4,"Very Comfortable, But Not Life Changing (XL Twin)","I bought this pad hoping to extend the life of my ten year-old mattress that has been in the process of slowly destroying my back. It's wicked comfortable - my cat agrees - and seems to be pretty high quality, but my back is still bugging me. Maybe it's me, maybe it's the mattress, or maybe the pad just doesn't work, but regardless, I'd still recommend it on comfort alone. It certainly has improved my sleeping in ability, I'll tell you that.I was a little disappointed in the pad's packaging - it looked and felt like cheap saran wrap - but the pad barely smelled at all, which I know is a problem with a lot of other foam pads. I ordered the XL twin size for my XL bed and the pad is absolutely enormous. I feel like the princess and the pea. I probably would have been fine with a regular twin."
2,Smells funny,Maybe its just the one I got but it smells strongly like mint and I aired it out for a week to finally get it to mellow out. Wouldn't buy again.
4,Great product for the price,For the price of this mattress pad it's very comfortable to sleep on and I would recommend it for purchase
5,Can't sleep without it,We have a king size bed that is drooping in the middle a little bit. I bought this as a christmas gift for my girlfriend and now I don't think we can live without it. Feels like we're floating when we're laying it. Obviously with this much foam it requires a little extra effort to get in and out of bed but it's worth it.
5,Memory Foam Mattress Topper,This mattress topper has made a huge difference in my wife's ability to sleep soundly with less joint pain than she has in years! Very worthy investment!
5,perfect mattress topper,"After reading many reviews for the different brands of memory foam toppers we decided on this one. Our mattress was just starting to get a little firm and my hips and shoulder sometimes hurt at night. I was worried about reviews of the different toppers because of complaints about odors, too soft, too firm etc. This one is perfect- everything that we hoped for. No bad odor from it at all. It gives our bed the perfect comfort. We put our mattress pad on top of it because I was worried that the foam would make us hot, but no problems there. The size is also just right for the king bed- it just comes to the edge of the mattress. The 2 inch seems just fine. We get a comfortable sleep now."
5,Great way to renew your mattress.,THis was a life saver. We just bought a mattress a few months ago and what was comfortable for my husband was not comfortable for me. The mattress was way too hard and I was waking up in pain every morning. Instead of spending hundreds again on a new mattress I decided to try this memory foam topper. It is terrific. Its like a new mattress and much softer. Works way better than the fabric mattress topper we tried. It did take 1 day to expand out of the package back to its original shape and it was a good way to air it out. It does not smell or give off an odor.
4,Great Product for the Price,"We purchased this for our 9-year old's bed. We purchased a cheap mattress for her first ""big girl"" bed when she moved out of her toddler bed, and didn't really want to spend a lot of money purchasing a new mattress now. She loves the new mattress pad."
5,Two weeks,"We have enjoyed better sleep, both of us, and I have had persistent lower back pain for years. That has almost gone away altogether. The memory pad is the difference."
4,Good product,"I placed this mattress topper on top of a hard mattress and it did make a difference. For the price, you can't ask for more."
5,Excellent buy,This was a gift for my elderly mother. She called to tell me that she finally got a good nights rest. She was extremely pleased and comfortable. Thanks.
4,Great product for better sleep. Improved my back!,This product has really helped me sleep better for the couple of months that I've owned it. It definitely takes a few days to get used to it and it back actually hurt in the beginning. Now that back pain I used to have is totally non existent even when I'm not in bed. When the room is a little colder it does get hard but your body temperature will soften up pretty quick. A good buy if you need some extra shape shifting support for your body without making your bed too soft.
5,My first memory foam purchase,"My wife has been wanting a new bed so not only did we get one, but I purchased this topper. The bed was an improvement and the topper is still making a noticeable difference on top of it. I tried the memory foam mattress at the bed store and spending $1,500 less but still having some memory foam comfort (memory foam bed was really nice) is a worthwhile compromise."
5,Great Deal!,"I purchased this Memory foam topper without having tested any in the past. Overall I have been very surprised with it's durability and comfort level. It makes my bed so much more comfortable and conforms to my body. I would highly recommend this product because it is a great price compared to other foam toppers, yet doesn't suffice any quality. It came tightly rolled up, yet I was able to use it by the time I went to bed. Other reviews talk about it having a weird scent, but that quickly disappears."
4,get bigger size pad,"This is a five star pad, but only gets 4 stars because you need to know that you should get the larger size foam, then cut it to fit your mattress (as the mattress foam sizes are all slightly smaller than the size of mat they're made for). I didn't find it smelly, but I did air it out for like an hour. I also didn't find it too hot. It makes a very nice memory foamish cushion. I'd also recommend getting a mattress pad to put over the foam, like:Newpoint International 370-Thread Count Mercerized Cotton Queen Mattress Pad."
5,Sleeping Better Now,I ordered this in a twin size> It was full cut and first quality. It was money well spent and you need not give it a second thought. Order it!!
5,Great purchase!!,"So glad I bought this! My husband and I love it! Very comfortable and breathable. It doesn't make me feel warmer at night; the holes help keep good air circulation. Even my husband, who usually gets very warm at night, finds it to be very comfortable and relaxing. In contrast to reviews I have read by others, I didn't notice a strong chemical smell when it came out of the box and plastic wrapping. It unrolled perfectly and I put it on my bed that day."
5,Worth the money,"We were concerned that the memory foam would ""sleep hot,"" but it is just the most comfortable thing ever. My only complaint is that it is hard to convince myself to get up in the morning! It took about 24 hours for the compressed foam to relax, and the odor was minimal for the first night. My husband has back and neck problems and he says this is like sleeping on a cloud, but with the firm support of our mattress underneath. I would highly recommend this product."
3,Its perfect for home but not for camping,"The mattress is very comfortable and it seems to be good quality. However, I bought it for camping inside our trailer and we were disapointed. I am not sure if it is because of the cold weather during the night but the mattress would be very comfy when we first go to sleep but in the middle of the night until the morning the mattress would be as hard as the floor to the point of giving me body aches. This happened every night we were camping and it would soften up again during the day."
5,Perfect for daughter's dorm room,"I purchased this for my daughter who had complained that her college dorm bed was very firm and uncomfortable. I had it shipped to her college and it arrived in four days via standard shipping. She opened it and after allowing it to expand for a few hours, she placed it on her bed. She informed me that there were no odors (no complaints from roommates either) and therefore no need to air it outside like some other reviewers have described. She reported that it is extremely comfortable and that she now enjoys deep long sleep (when her busy schedule allows!). I should mention that I purchased the Xlong twin to fit her bed. She reported a perfect fit. She particularly likes the fact that this mattress topper has a removable and washable cover. Great product and service."
3,"Great comfort, but totally unusable in a warm bedroom.","Putting one of these on top of a firm mattress with good support is probably the most comfortable bed you can possibly have. However, they do not breathe at all and are rendered completely useless during summer or if your bedroom is warm. You will wake up in a pool of sweat about an hour after you fall asleep if it's too warm in your bedroom."
4,"Worth it for the price, seems to have helped.","I was looking to improve my sleeping in and was also waking up with some lower back pain on the weekends. I had a queen down comforter underneath my sheet before, which was super comfy, but I still was unable to sleep in comfortably. I would wake up dizzy and back pain. I could fall asleep perfectly but sleeping in was the problem. My friend found this online and showed it to me, so I decided to try it. Seems to be helping so far. I've had it about 2 weeks now. The only thing I would complain about is that it smells like chocolate mint. Haven't had it long enough to say whether it's gone away. But it IS comfortable. Worth the buy."
2,Look nothing like the picture,"When i open the package i was really disappointed, my mattress pad is hard, flat and the length is shorter then my mattress. Don't worth it for this price. Very unhappy with this item."
5,you don't know what you missing,"perfect!this pad is just perfect.don't hesitate.comes in a box,rolled in clear plastic wrap.all you do is unroll it and in half an hour you get your 2"" pad.not firm,not soft-perfect in between.smell-light peppermint-which is a big plus to the maker-others have horrible rotten smell that won't go away.but this one...it's like you had back ache from sleeping on previous mattress and applied ""mineral ice"" ointment on your back.but the smell goes away.leave it laying uncovered for a bit....so,buy it!"
2,Cheapened product,"I just received this mattress topper in a twin size and I am very disappointed. A few months ago, I got this same mattress topper in queen size and it was excellent, nice and firm. The twin sized mattress topper that I just received is much, much softer, more like foam rubber than memory foam. I will talk to my daughter about whether it is worth keeping, but you should know, that in my experience, the positive reviews that are posted are for a very different product."
3,5 months - Worn Out,We have had this on our bed for 5 months now and it's already pretty worn out. It has dips where we sleep and the middle is still in the original shape. It is pretty simple and the price is good but we've had two other memory foam mattresses that were better. I'm not sure what the key is to getting a good topper but my guess is more money. The two I had before cost about twice as much.
3,sent wrong size,"I ordered the twin size, got a full size, very difficult to cut down. It's comfortable, but no fitted sheets will now fit, extra two inches makes a huge difference"
1,TOXIC SMELL,"The smell is horrible and it contains chemicals that cause cancer. I aired it out, hung it up outside for over a week and it's still smelling horrible. If I had known it causes cancer I would never have bought it. What a waste of money and a hazard to the public."
2,"Very firm, OK for the price","I did a lot of research and after reading one amazing review after another, I decided to go for it. I've slept on this for over two weeks and can honestly say that I am not fully satisfied. As with almost anything dealing with bedding, this had a factory smell (mint chocolate chip...no kidding). The smell is decimating slowly but surely. I find the mattress to be very firm for ""memory foam"". I expected to almost nest into the topper but it doesn't exactly work like that. I still toss and turn and and notice no difference since I've put this on. I need something softer. I would not recommend it."
2,It IS too hot,"It is TOO HOT. I like a cool room and warm bedding, but this is more than I can stand.The website says, ""Contrasted with many memory foams which seem to trap heat, ViscO2 permits five times as much air flow to keep the body cool and comfortable."" If that's true, memory foam must be like a furnace! I tried this for a week and woke up repeatedly, feeling like I was sleeping on an electric blanket. I switched back to my old wool mattress pad -- slept like a baby. I tried this because the wool pad, after twenty years, has shrunk and gotten matted. But I'm going to fork out the money to replace it.I'm glad most people find this product to be so great, but I was sadly disappointed. It's nice and cushy, but not enough to offset the heat generation. Think twice about buying this if you ""run hot"" because it's damn near impossible to get back in the box and you'll pay more than $13 in S&H; (as of this writing) to return it. Try one from a local store first."
4,Memory Foam Review,"My bed was becoming a little too firm for my liking and I decided to try out a memory foam topper, but the thicker ones in store were so expensive! After reading the reviews on this topper, I decided to try it and I am satisfied. It created more cushion for my back and I don't wake up with a sore back. When I received the topper, it did smell like mint chocolate chips or something like that, but it only lasted about 48 hours. Don't let the ""smell factor"" weigh in your decision, because after those 48 hours, the smell was completely gone. I would recommend this product to someone who is not ready to buy a new mattress, but would like some more cushion for their back."
1,Not memory foam,"We bought one of these toppers in December of 2011 and LOVED it! We just bought another one and it is not the same quality. We took it out of the box, left it for 24 hours and it had no memory foam capability. We are returning and looking for a new memory foam topper, so disappointing. Based on some other reviews of recent, I have to agree that they have reduced the quality of their product and it is not up to par. I do have to say though, Amazon is awesome about their return policy!"
4,Smells Like Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream,"We are moving at the end of the year, so I was looking for a topper that would stretch out our current mattress' shelf life until then...this seems like it will work! Our bed, a Serta with a built-in memory foam top, is so much more comfortable now! Sure, there are little quibbles--once you settle down for the night it is sometimes hard to get out of the cocoon that the foam has created around you--but for the money, this was a steal!My main concern is the smell. It is not a bad smell, or even a very strong smell, but it does smell like mint chocolate chip ice cream. I find this mildly disturbing as I do not particularly like minty things, but I think that I am more bothered by the randomness of a mattress topper smelling like ice cream than the actual smell.It could be worse, but not a whole lot better."
2,Nothing special,"There definitely was an odor. Oddly enough it smells like mint chocolate chip which is really just more annoying than horrible. I let it air out for 36 hours but it still smells up my bed. After sleeping on it, all it did was shift the pressure point I had in my shoulder without the topper to my hip with the topper. It also makes the bed very warm. I enjoy being able to move to a cooler spot and now there are no cool spots. That's nice when you first get into bed on a cold night but not toward the morning as you're trying to cool off"
5,Hallelujah!,"I never thought I could sleep on such comfy foam without the usual hot flashes from accumulated body heat. But this product, so simple in its resolution of the problem, has brought me such comfort for my entire body. I'm thoroughly pleased!"
4,Good topper,Made our air mattress much more bearable. Did not have any back pain the morning. Didn't really notice any odor when it was opened.
