4,Perfect for the college student,"The book was in good condition, and arrived in a timely fashion. There was only a minor discoloration on the back cover and at the bottom of the pages in back. I use the book often while writing research papers for my classes and would in fact purchase this product again."
4,apa format 5th edition,I like the spiral back easy to move through the book. The book is what I expected for helping me with the formatting process.
3,When you need it,"This is a technical manual that would only be woth the purchase if you really need it. Undergraduate students could likely get by with a quick reference chart (BarCharts, Inc. for example) for a small fraction of the cost and without taking up shelf space or killing several trees. However, if you need it you need it and there is no substitute."
3,Writing Help APA Style,"This book is helpful for anyone needing help with APA style writing,but somewhat difficult to use, as it appears their are contraditions in the way some things are citied in different sections of the book."
5,"Get the book, and use it","Those who criticize APA style are those who don't want anyone telling them what to do or how to write. The style is not cumbersome, it is not restrictive, and it doesn't get in the way of good writing any more than footnotes or endnotes get in the way.If you're required to use APA style, this is the book to get. Just make sure you actually open it up and use it!"
3,"As good as any, but that's not saying much","I find all of these text nearly impossible to use and this is no exclusion. Confusing, it gives no overall picture of what citations should be like and simply muddles me up. I know its necessary, and it is, but will someone please write one of these I can understand???"
3,It's serviceable,"The book is a little long and it's not as easy to find the things I need as I would like. However, I am eventually able to get the answers."
1,Badly Organized Manual,"This book jumps all over the place and is very confusing. For example, detailed instructions for how to include various forms of electronic media in the reference section should be RIGHT NEXT TO how they are cited within the text. But instead the instructions for citing within the text are in some completely different universe within the book. This is not so much a manual as a melting pot of random information. Occasionally it appears to be working well, delivering information logically, and then suddenly the next obvious step is missing. Very, very strange for a field that studies what drives people crazy."
3,FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS,COLLEGE TEXT. HARD TO NAVIGATE. NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY. TOO MUCH INFORMATION CRAMED TOGETHER IN A SECTION..... HARD TO FIND EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED...TIME CONSUMING!! NOT RECOMMENDED.
3,5th Edition APA Publication Manual,"Even though there are only a few changes to the 5th edition, I would recommend getting it. It is too confusing to use an older edition especially if you are pressed for time or have never used this type of manual before.Also I recommend marking your book with tabs such as in the ""Reference Citations in Text"" section or the ""Reference List"" chapter. Marking the book with tabs helped me find my way to the information that I needed over and over again. I've tended to use the same type of references throughout my graduate courses."
3,"Small changes, big headaches","As an ABD-PhD candidate who's required to use APA format (and halfway through a dissertation using APA 4th edition), the small changes in this latest edition do little to add clarity and readability to a manuscript, but much to frustrate: Underlining references has been replaced with italics; after utilizing first-line indents in a Reference list (easier for a word processor) we've now gone back to second-line hanging indents; and none of these changes are clearly discussed in a ""Revisions in the 5th Edition"" chapter, you need to find them on your own in each chapter. I appreciate the updated guide for citing electronic resources, but the remainder seems to be aimed at ""buy yet-another version"" rather than major improvements and substantive changes. Maddening! If you're required to use it, you're stuck. Otherwise, keep the old 4th edition."
3,Here we go again!,"Here we go again... more minor changes to APA style! The hanging indent is back, we don't have to type long lists of author names anymore, and we can now use parentheses (woo-hoo!).If you need to prepare manuscripts in APA style and don't have a previous edition of the manual, then you need this book. Though it remains relatively user-unfriendly, it is nonetheless the bible of manuscript preparation.If you already have the fourth edition... determine how many of the changes in the fifth edition apply to your work. If you mostly write ""plain vanilla"" research reports and your reference lists mostly consist of ordinary journal articles, you may be able to get by with some handwritten notes in the margins of your old book."
3,"Very Difficult, But Necessary","Out of all the stylebooks I have had occasion to use as a professional editor, I have found this one to be the most difficult to follow and understand--the most difficult to master.I am not a psychologist, but I am a professional medical editor, and I feel sorry for those who must follow this style when writing theses, articles, book chapters, and other items for publication. In addition, I find some of the APA's requirements (particularly in the references, which have their own unique style quite unlike most others) incomprehensible.That having been said, this book is a must for those who want to be published by the APA, and those who are editing for same. Once it has been read many times, and key passages put to memory, it is not as hard to understand--but it shouldn't be so hard. The section on figures and tables, however, is a truly excellent primer, for any professional writer, not just those in the health care professions.My grade: C plus."
2,it sucks...but you have no choice!,"Yes, this book sucks. The index is terrible, it is impossible to find anything in the index so you are reduced to have 27 tabs sticking out of your APA manual. However, it is your bible when you're writing/editing an APA paper, so you're stuck with it.It is incredibly confusing and frustrating, especially the sections on number rules and citing internet sources. The sample papers could be more detailed.The sections on writing style are actually helpful. I teach an undergraduate writing course where APA style is required and these rules (e.g, conciseness and clarity) are helpful for students.So...in sum: this book sucks, but if you need to use APA style this is the best one you can get. Be prepared to embark on a journey of post-it tabs!"
2,"Not much help for writing journal articles, and yet ...","This book is very difficult to use, even for people experienced in writing journal articles and using style sheets. The index could be much better, the examples clearer."
3,I prefer MLA,"If your professor requires you to use APA, I wouldn't buy this, .. I'd just look up APA guidelines online, you should be okay."
2,Fresno APA,"I really didn't care for this manual. I am a visual person, so I need to see real example with explainations. I thought it was a waste of money. There are some examples, but not many. Prior to buying this book I used the internet for help in citing and composing APA papers and I find the net just as useful if not more. I don't know the exact address for the website, but its something like apaowl. If you search apa and owl it should come up. I did buy the apa software, but I haven't use it yet. My suggestion is to check apa websites first. I am half way through my masters program and I use the net for help much more than the manual."
3,Mixed bag...,"While this was full of information that I desperately needed, and was indeed helpful in my graduate classes, I found that the layout was confusing, and it was rather hard to use.The biggest complaint was that it seemed a little behind the times. It was very weak on citations pulled from the internet. I was confused about which format to use for the different articles. Face it, the internet is a major source for research, and fewer and fewer of us are actually pulling periodicals out of some library basement. A chapter should be dedicated to citing internet sources. Luckily, I don't think my professor knew how to properly cite them any better than I did.This is the fifth edition of the manual that was written in 2001. It is overall useful, but needs updating."
2,For the graduate student,"For those writing research analysis papers or non-publishing papers;My graduate school professors have strongly recommended this book and are adamant that we use APA version 5.This book does not provide the information on formatting in an easy to follow or find manner. (Free) websites like the University of Wisconsin are much better and easy to access, provides other links. U of W totally rocks compared to this book."
2,Confusing,I found this manual to be quite confusing. There were some topics that should have provided and exapmle but did not. The information seemed to be too broken up.
2,Not Very User Friendly,"I have just completed writing a Master's Thesis for a degree program that required that the Thesis be written in APA format. The layout of the manual is very difficult to use and one has to look in several places with the hope that they will find the right way to format something. The index is helpful but not as helpful as it could be. I hope that a future edition of this manual will provide better and more varied examples that are actually applicable to people who have to use the manual to write papers, theses and dissertations."
3,Book Review,"This book isn't the best APA manual out there. They only give one sample of an APA paper. In addition, it is somewhat difficult to navigate. But, this book is ""THE"" APA manual and so it the most accurate book for APA format."
1,TOO much,"I found this textbook to be completely useless. Hard to find the examples I needed. I found more condensed books, like A Writer's Reference by Diana Hacker (ISBN 0-312-45025-7)to be more helpful."
1,Purchased it because I had to.,"Had to purchase it because I needed for graduate studies. This book is obsolete now as the new edition is out. For those of you who have purchased the new APA manual 6th edition, hope you have heard about all of the mistakes in it. Contact APA and the should send you corrections. You can have your copy sent there and they'll send a new one w/o charge."
4,"5th edition,American Psycholgical Association",I was very please with my copy of the book.I plan to order more of my textbooks from this site.
1,Students don't waste your time,"This book is very complicated and hard to follow. Although it was recommended by my college, there are better books out there to help students with APA format. Don't waste your money"
3,Do you really need this text?,"I had to buy this text as part of my Master's program; however, in reading it, I'm questioning why. If you have Office 2007 for Students, the APA/MLA formatting is in the program. There is also a program called Paper Doctor that does your formatting for you. These are both cheaper than buying this textbook, and you're not learning new info from scratch. You only have to go through simple tutorials.The company that sent me the text was very efficient and timely. I'm just wondering if I wasted my money."
1,Buy the spiral bound version,The blue spiral-bound version gives examples and talks you through how to cite in APA format; this one is utterly useless and a waste of a college student's money.
1,Edition Five is Now Out of Date,Edition five is now out of date. Go to the APA website and you will see edition six.
4,A must have,"Every discipline has its arcana to be mastered, and the social sciences are no exception. But if that's where you are, this manual is a must-have. I'm what they call a ""recovering lawyer""--lawyers have their style manual which is just as bad--you just gotta learn it!Having said that, I didn't find this manual all that hard to use. With a little practice and a lot of diligent searching for the right example of a citation, you can learn the basics. I relied heavily on Chapter 4, with its extensive list of 95 examples of everything under the sun.I'd advise spending a little more and investing in the spiral bound version. The pages are large, the print clear, and it lies nice and flat on the desk. Every little bit helps!"
5,"APA style is difficult, but very useful","The APA manual (5th edition in this case) is sometimes difficult to follow. However, the concepts for proper written communication are extremely useful, especially at the doctoral learning level."
3,APA book,"it's useful, but little bit difficult for starters.However, I heard there is no book which is more accurate than this book.After becoming familiar with this book, I'm sure I can take advantage of this book."
3,It is good but could be more simpler.,"Of course, this is my opinion but I just think that the book could be more simple or easier. Although, it does show APA formatting, the last one showed examples and more in depth. Most of us students need that. It is a good book do not get me wrong but like with most things, it could be better."
3,It's really tough but you will need it!,"I tried for a long time to deny using this book, even though I bought it off a course list and had it on my shelf. After being told several times by professors that my documents needed to be in APA style, with no quick description offered, I have been forced to go in and learn the format. It's a bit like learning a foreign language but since I've learned to use it, it's come up again, and again, and again, so I'm glad I finally did it.Check out ""The Emotional Intelligence Quick Book"" as well. It's a fun read, based on sound research, that let me test my EQ online. Boy, did I need my EQ skills while learning APA style!"
2,Get another book!,"The book is very poorly layed out. It was hard to search for topics in the index and find it in the book. This book did not help me one bit in writing APA style papers. I would recommend a different book and an APA computer program, which really helps to guide you through formatting the paper from title page to reference page."
2,Buy the software instead!,"If you have to write papers in APA style I recommend just buying the software instead. For what it is, I am sure it is fabulous, but working full time and taking a masters program I don't have time to look up how to do all the notation, etc. Just buy the software program and it makes it much easier."
1,Oppressive,The APA was the required format throughout my doctoral studies. The manual is NOT user friendly and the format is not particularly helpful. I haven't read the other manuals but I can't imagine that they could be any worse than the APA manual and probably a whole lot better.
1,Ridiculous,I bought this to help with college after being out for 10yrs-almost impossible to install plus it does not allow you to make any adjustments if your professor wants it a certain way. Useless-buy the cheat sheet at barnes and noble.
2,The Plot was pretty slow moving,"I don't know... i just think the plotting of this novel was just pretty slow and not really exciting at all. The villains were just cardboard characters, the hero was kinda blah, and it just didn't build to an exciting resolution. So I can only give it two stars for effort..."
1,APA Manual - The discourse of the discipline.,"APA Manual - The discourse of the disciplinary regime.Simply stated, this book is poorly organized and makes the reader wade through many pages in an attempt to find the `correct answer.' The object? - because I are studying under a disciplinary regime and must conform to what the knowledge experts tell us is real."
4,College Life Saver,"Anyone in college will value this manual! I have papers and reports due every week that must be cited and referenced APA style. This book is a ""must""."
2,Not User Friendly!!!,"This manual was required for a course in report writing. Everything was to be written in APA style, with the aid of the manual. Sorry, the manual was so user unfriendly and time consuming to use, even the instructor gave up hope!"
1,Not worth the money!,"I am required to write several papers in APA format in my nursing classes. This book is NOT ""user-friendly"". I can't find anything I need unless I search throughout the entire book, page by page."
5,Resource Tool,"This a great product for anyone who does a lot of writing, high school and higher level students, etc."
3,A bit hard to understand,"If you are attending graduate school and you are required to read APA this book can be useful. What I liked about the manual was that it covered specific guidelines for writing in APA style( As it sholuld).What I felt could use improvement was how it does not give thorough ""dummy proof"" explanations to writing APA. As nervous as anyone can be writing in APA, I beleive the directions and instructions could have used some work."
5,Excellent resource for reference!,Excellent resource for reference when writing a Doctorate dissertation. I needed to purchase this item for an advanced writing class and I have obtained more information from it than I have located on the Internet. I will continue using this book as an informative resource while writing my dissertation and I highly suggest it as a benefit to anyone writing a Doctorate or PhD dissertation as it provides the correct way to use APA format in that paper format.
2,Horribly formatted! (What irony!),"If this manual has all the answers, there's no way of knowing it because its organization of information--to use the term very loosely--is absolutely awful! How did APA come to be the accepted format and how did this horrible book come to be its ""bible""?!"
5,APA Must,"This is anAPA must, like a Bible for professional papers required for submission. Some parts are so scholarly written and this makes it a little complicated to understand. However, a highligher, sticky notes and make a 3 x 5 card with favorite pages are helpful tips for success. Highly recommend."
5,***** 5 STAR SELLER *****,I just love the book. I needed it for college classPublication Manual of the American Psychological Association
5,Boring but Required,"The ""Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association"" is one those boring but necessary books that eventually will be on your shelf whether you like it or not. It is on mine.Those of us who make a living by combining words into sentences acquiesce to collecting various style manuals. You know the list: MLA, Chicago, APA, and for those with a journalistic or marketing bent, the AP. The social services, many teaching journals (not all), and of course, most psychological journals require using the APA style for white papers, essays and the like.Style formats make life easier on the editors you write for, and the APA does that job precisely.I fully recommend ""Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association,"" not because it will make you smile like a Barbara Cartland novel, but because academic journals editors will smile with a satisfied look while reading your writing.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"
3,Here we go again...,"Only a few minor adjustments from previous editions make a new edition seem almost redundant. However, the hanging indent is back, and the information on referencing electronic media has been updated to reflect greater use of the internet in research. Overall, a useful resource."
1,The trials and tribulations of APA,"Publications Manual for the American Psychological Association. ISBN: 1557988102.This book lies in the category of ironing clothes, shoveling snow and doing taxes: it is necessary but not pleasant.This book is extremely not user friendly. It is organized in such a way that the most relevant information on how to format references is in the middle (pages 232 - 281); one has to jump around to different sections, and try to glean the information necessary to write a footnote, endnote or reference page.However, this is the new standrda for referncign in the social sciences. Mastery of this format, and this book are key. Once you have gained a working knowledge, you can switch to the software, that prompts you as you go, or use the smaller companion booklet."
2,What is your frustration tolerance threshold?,"How do I get through this thing in time to write my paper that's due tomorrow?! This ""manual"" is NOT user-friendly."
2,Absolutely Necessary - UNFORTUNATELY,"After 25 years writing as a business consultant, now back to school, APA style seems like something from the dark ages. I know, this is a review of the book not the style.I found the book poorly organized and hard to use as a reference. If you are required to write in strict APA style you will need this book, but don't expect to garner anything from it quickly. It looks like a manual that has been built up layer upon layer over many versions, instead of planed fresh, start to finish. The guide also often leaves room for varying interpretation. If you are writing for a prof. that is a stickler, be prepared to quiz him or her on interpretation of specific style rules."
1,Must have a decoder ring!,"If you are currently enrolled, plan to enroll, or know someone who is in college, this is a must have, but beware. The 5th ed. was great, easy to follow, and was a great help, but this edition...I hate it. Unfortunately, there are many changes, so this edition is required. It is cumbersome to find anything, and when you do it doesn't make sense, doesn't provide examples, its worthless in my opinion. I bought another APA book, ""APA Made Easy,"" and have been using that instead."
2,Evil But Necessary,"This is one of the most cumbersome and difficult to navigate reference books out there, and it is notorious for being so. I highly suggest getting an APA formatting program for writing your papers using this style. I use APA PERRLA myself, and love it. You will still need to refer to the publication manual for your more rarely used reference types, etc. Unfortunately, it's a necessary evil."
1,Warning!!!,I ordered this book in the middle of April. It is now the last day in May and I have not yet received it. I was to receive it by May 20. I emailed the seller a week and a half ago and have not received a reply. I am warning you not to purchase anything from this seller!!!!
3,APA Style'n,This is very helpful...especially since I have been out of school for a while and now since I am taking advance classes for my Masters in Communication. Great resource to write research papers and also helpful with work grammar!
4,APA spiral bound style book,This product is in perfect condition and is easy to use! the fact that it is spiral bound makes it easier to find and locate the various contents within the book without creasing the cover or other pages.
5,A great writing resource!,"This book is proving to be a valuable resource for outlining the writing ""rules of the road"". I'm in the midst of writing my doctoral dissertation and the APA Manual has proved extremely useful for learning the proper way to cite references from various sources (like telephone conversations), use combinations of unusual punctuation (should the comma go inside or outside this parentheses?), and for presenting statistical output and tables. I can see it continuing to be a useful reference for writing articles in professional journals as well since it offers guidance on writing manuscripts and authorship (which is a topic that can bring collaborators to fisticuffs!) I highly recommend this book!"
3,"Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, fifth edition","The information is in there, it just takes time finding it. If you are not familiar with, or haven't written anything of length recently, you may have difficulty using this book."
4,Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (Spiral Edition),This was a great source for looking up how to do APA style of writing. I would get it if you are at all confused on how to do APA or are a Psyc. major/minor!
1,NOT USER FRIENDLY,"I purchased this book becuase I have never written papers using the APA style. I had hoped that it would give me clear and concise direction on formatting the correct style. I was hoping to see examples of reference pages, etc. and they just aren't there. Trying to find your way around the book is kind of like trying to break an encryption code. You can tell this manual was written by academics and psychologists with no real desire to instruct. I found much better information and references on the internet after purchasing this book. I would suggest doing an internet search for APA style and use the many free references avaialable on the internet. Save your money and don't purchase this book."
1,wrong edition,"I ordered using the ISBN and got the 5th edition, not the 6th. My professor insists that the APA changes fequently and that I need the 6th edition. Fairly easy to read, which surprised me, but if it's out of date, it is no good to me."
4,college student,"Product arrived in good shape, as promised. Shipping took a bit longer than I anticipated. Be sure you buy from this seller early, especially if you live on the east coast."
4,There is a new edition!,"There is a newer 6th edition, which I did not realize when I bought this one. I'm not sure what the differences are, so I'm going to make do with this one"
1,Written by Beelzebub's Shrink!!!,"I don't know how anyone can give this ""manual"" a good rating. It is densely obtuse, does not give one clear example of an APA paper...This is not a manual, it is a paen to obfuscation. It seems fitting that this is the American Psychological Association's idea of a how-to guide. Maybe by the time you rise through the ranks of Academia you can no longer organize or explain things simply and intelligently in an organized way. Get this if you must (I had to), but also get one of those short-cut guides that will actually give examples. And WHATEVER you do, DO NOT buy the APA CD. You have been warned!"
3,Don't waste your money.,"As a graduate student in psychology, I suggest that the best way to learn APA style is to obtain a copy of a manuscript from a TA or your academic advisor. This book is ineptly organized and its own ""style"" is stultifying. The only saving grace is that it includes ""pictures"" of text formated in APA-style. A big complaint is that the Publication Manual pretends that the only kind of article written by psychologists involves presenting the results of an empirical investigation. Another is the unwieldy and illogical system of citation (especially of material found on the Web). Also, I would like for the publishers to at least acknowledge that what is actually published in professional journals often bears no resemblance to the format required for submission. Whatever you do, do not buy the APA Style Helper software."
3,-,Not a very good book. Hard to find info you are looking for. There are better books on the market if you really need this info.
4,I buy all my books here,I love amazon cos I am in milary right now and where am at I don't get much pay plus I have to pay half of my tuition and bye my own books so I can't afford new one. I know I can always trust amazon for the same book for less.
3,If you can wait you should - NEW EDITION COMING SOON,"If you can wait to buy this book you should try. The APA is currently re-writing it, and it will include more on electronic documents.As a text it is average. Nothing amazing, but what is required."
5,On my keeper shelf,"I am a sucker for characterization, and Susan Isaacs hooked me with this one. Not only are her characters extremely well constructed and developed, but she has a particularly deft touch with figurative language and description. Authors writing in first person can slip and incorporate language which, while well done, seems at odds with the character's voice. Isaacs manages to turn phrases which are uniquely suited to Linda's background and way of expressing herself while still being striking and illuminating.I don't generally care to touch on plot, but I will say that for those who have seen the movie, trust me, the book is far, far better. Forget what you know of the movie and come for the real story."
4,War and romance in one,"This is my first S. Isaacs book and I enjoyed it. It started out a bit slow, but definitely picked up in the second half of the book, as Linda (and later, Lina) struggles with an alcoholic mother. She marries her office love, only to find that the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Fighting the stereotypes in the office, she grows and eventually becomes a hero in wartime as she serves as a spy for the US and finds her true love in the end."
1,Worst book ever written makes worst movie ever made,"Just for the record, the film version of ""Shining Through"" starring Michael Douglas and Melanie Griffith, swept the Razzie Awards the year it was released. The Razzies are, of course, the Oscar awards for worst movie of the year. If memory serves, this got worst Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and script. The film follows the novel pretty faithfully except for the creation of a sympathetic German officer played by Liam Neeson who is absent from the book.Which brings us to the problem of the book: it's vile. Linda Voss has zero sympathy for the German people suffering under the Nazi regime. What a heroine -- there's even a paragraph where she feels moderate pity for the suffering of orphaned German kids and old people made homeless by the Allied bombing but shrugs it off saying ""they had it coming.""This book and ""The Unlikely Spy"" probably go hand in hand for most inexplicable bestseller based on one of the worst periods of human history."
1,SUSAN ISAACS: GERMAN ANTI-SEMITISM STILL WORST IN WORLD. AS VICHY FRANCE...,"The absolute worst book of delusion you will ever waste your time reading. This book is full of emptiness. Isaacs cleverly spews her hatred in disguise of a story. American publishing has gone to the dogs - susan isaacs writes to hate not to heal.Do we blame the publisher, susan isaacs? Do not waste time or money with all the hype on this book. Don't support bitter writers like German hating/bashing Isaacs. Come to your senses!Swedish Proverb: ""Empty Barrells Make The Most Noise."" This barraell ist IsaacsVi ses"
5,Great Book,"I have read this novel several times over the years. I was delighted to find it available for my Kindle so had to buy it andreread. Now I can pass the paperback book on to those not fortunate enough to have an ereader. Thanks, Amazon, for providingmore books for Kindle."
3,. Milligrams of anti-antioxidants = 4 tablets not 1,"You feel your getting a decent price, $32 for 120 tablets - until you read the recommended dosage needed - 4 tablets per day required to give you what is stated on the ingredients label."
3,Source Naturals Renewal Antioxidants,"These are probably great pills, but they are much too large for me to swallow."
5,Great Product,"I received the product as expected and in a timely fashion. I was pleased with the Lecithin Granules, I find them very tasty in a smoothie."
2,Lecithin Granules,I do not like the taste of it. Only tried it 2 times. I don't think will try it again.
5,nice buy,This Product arrived timely and is exactly what I was shopping for. I would venture to say I will buy again.
1,Gets only one star because ZERO is not an option,"Its a great printer. But the cartridges are exhorbitantly priced. Refill kits and reloaded carts are available, but they cost as much as buying one from Dell and there's no guarantee that they will work. A new printer can be had for $152, and a 6000 page cartridge is $90. Then there is the drum kit...ah, sorry. Not working for me. I don't like the math."
4,Great Printer,"I bought this printer from Amazon in August for $199. It was easy to set up on the network and prints very well. PC Magazine complained about the printing speed being a bit on the slow side- but I do not agree. For a home office or a small business it works just fine. The toner cartridges and drums are MUCH less expensive than the comparable ones from Brother. My Brother printer before this worked just fine but after 20,000 pages I needed to buy a new drum...for $149 if I didn't want an off-brand product! Instead I just bought the new Dell printer!In regard to the previous review- I TOO bought this under the impression that it came with the 800 sheet tray. I emailed Amazon twice afterwards and in true Amazon style- they told me it was a misprint and simply changed the description/title. It must be nice to advertise one thing and then sell another. But it was still a great deal. I just don't care for the way they handle customer complaints."
2,SLOW REACTION,"This printer is very slow to print, but once it is started it runs great. The size of this thing is rediculous; my HP 4L took up less space and reaction time was quick. However this printer can take a beating and keep on printing. I have dropped several time from over 3 ft and it is still running. Toner cartridges are a bit expensive and only last 3000 pages."
3,"Easy read, but didn't evoke interest in me.","I picked this book up based on a recommendation from a coworker. She said it made her consider her beliefs of god, and that it was haunting. Neither of which I felt. I think the author tries to pose a point about the ignorance of uncompromising belief, but the story didn't ask any questions that I already didn't think of. The only parts that remotely humored me were the inner monologue when the protagonist describes the hate he stores away for his son and his ""boring"" life.The book never asked question I hadn't already thought about. If you don't question God's existence then the book may pose questions for you."
4,"Scared the holy hell out of me, I had everyone read it!!!!!","I read this book in one afternoon and into the evening. At times I huddled in my chair shaking, at other times I actually cried. I have Never read a book that scared me as much as this one. I have had four copies and lent them out and got the same reviews that I gave to you. I suggest you read it during the daylight hours,and then watch a comedy before bed. Don't be alone and please lock your doors!"
5,They Loved It!,Purchased for XMAS stocking stuffer; item was received faster than I expected for the Holidays. If you know a child that enjoys lip gloss and collects key chains this is ideal.
4,"It's a cable--it worked, end of story.","What can one say about a printer cable, either it works or it doesn't. The packaging was annoying and difficult to open, the the quality of the cable seemed more than adequate."
2,Not as good as regular Scrabble Jr,"We have classic Scrabble Jr and this Disney version and frankly, this isn't as good as the original. First, you have to add or remove letters depending on which side of the board you are using, which is a pain. Second, there is no free play side as there is in regular Scrabble Jr, so the game can't really ""grow"" with your children. Third, the words are all disney Proper names, so it really isn't teaching the kids anything. Regular Scrabble Jr is a much better investment.(and I am a serious Disney fan, so I was really disappointed by this game.)"
1,A shameless marketing tool that exploits kids.,"Do your kids really need to learn 'words' such as kaa, nala, zazu or kanga? The original Scrabble Junior is a fantastic game for beginning readers, it is educational and fun to play with your kids. This abomination is a despicable attempt to attract young Disney fans without any regard for the real educational well-being of children. Shame on Disney and shame on Hasbro for concocting this manipulative and exploitative waste of time and money."
3,Regular Scrabble Jr. Would be Better,"This game is okay if your child is already a decent speller, but for a child just learning to spell/read I think the regular version of Scrabble Jr. is better. Scrabble Jr. Disney's words are all Disney based and what child needs to learn how to spell 'Jafar' when they don't know how to spell other more basic and useful words. That said, if your child is wild for Disney, this game might get them interested in spelling and reading."
2,Color substitution,Item arrived in a hideous lime green instead of blue as pictured. Nothing in the description indicates that there would be a color substitution.
1,"After 13 months TV is ""unrepairable""","DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM APEX! I purchased this TV for my husband for Christmas, 12/19/04. The TV is in our bedroom and is watched occasionally-not every day. After 13 months, the picture suddenly went black. I have sound but no picture. We took it to an authorized Apex repair shop and they told us it was unrepairable. They can't get parts from Apex and we would need a new LCD screen. Even if we could get the part, the cost would be quite high. For a TV that is watched 8 hours per week-MAXIMUM-and at a cost of over $1000, this TV should not be unrepairable. We are so upset, and feel we have been ripped off. The warranty is only good for 12 months. I urge everyone to NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM APEX. You will waste your money. The repair shop said they have had a number of these TVs and other Apex products come in but cannot be repaired-parts not available. There should be a law against this type of consumer ripoff."
2,Unimpressive...,"Surely the vaults must have better recording of this relationship then the one we have been served. For example Bohm in Berlin can be purchased at 6 dollars and ninety nine cents US and you will get not only a great orchestra but better recorded sound.Something goes wrong with this performance into the development section..for some really strange reason the balances in the first movement seem very unusual, tonally the reading has no ambient sound and therefore the beautiful ring we come to expect on a professionally engineered record in not there!As to tempi I find very little inspired with the handling of the themes...it is a bit like the orchetra is on beta blockers or maybe even worse sleeping....go to Solti in Vienna or even Herbert K with anyone....Kerstez is still my favorite in this area of Romantic repetoire."
5,Bar Set for Discriminating Tastes,"It is well-made, and the recipient really likes that it comes with its own stand. All the bar tools he wanted were in the set."
3,"Solid purchase, looks great, but that's about it","I received this product in good condition. Overall, it looked very attractive, and seems sturdy. I haven't used it yet, but I was disappointed that the construction of some of the tools doesn't seem to be very high quality. Instead of having the ice scoop in one molded piece, it's the scoop part welded onto the handle. That makes it flimsier than it how it could be. Also, the jigger cups were welded together in this same manner. I can't wait to try it out, though. Not the best of quality, but solid. I was neither blown away, or completely disappointed."
5,These are the only Potty pads to ever buy!!,"I have been using these pads since my dog was a puppy. This is also the most economical site I have ever found them on. Potty training was a breeze. I also use the tray and would recommend it. It can go anywhere with you. I have a disability so she is trained to use the tray with pads in a discreet part of the house. I tried cheaper brands, but this pad dries so quickly you can get multiple uses. A trick for training. Buy a can of Cheese Whiz. Each time your puppy does it's business give it a little cheese to lick off your finger-it really works!! And do not worry you will not be doing this forever. My dog who is my service dog only needed the extra praise for a short amount of time-we never had accidents either."
1,No Trax,"My puppy only wants to play with them and tear them up. She will go right beside them, but no on them."
1,Not designed to make you pass 70-100,"Using this book for the 70-100 exam is like studying a dictionary to write a one page essay. The author's attitude and arrogance is unbelievable at times with comments like ""if you missed that then you obviously were not paying attention"" - how distracting and annoying is that? The answers to the questions in this book are all subject to interpretation and this makes it harder to use as an exam preparatory guide. The book should be taken off the shelves and re-written to cover more case studies - after all, that is the focus of the exam!"
2,Nothing like the exam.,"I don't blame the publisher, I think that they probably wrote the book based on what Microsoft showed them with the beta exam. The final exam is nothing like this.Basically if you are a DBA you'll pass.The book is good for project design principles, but that isn't what is on the exam. The exam is mostly diagramming and SWAGing. And the case studies on the test are no where near as good as the ones in this book.Granted now that I have seen the test I know what to study. Hey maybe I should write a book...."
3,"Don't worry about this Sybex title, they almost newer miss.","Nice to see such an enthusiasm about not yet shipped title but I'm quite shure it will be quite handy book. As for me, I always prefer Sybex but not Microsoft titles for exam preparation."
4,"Good Book but, I want more Case Studies !!!",A very good book over all. But I want more case studies. 3 are to little!
3,Don't rely only on this book to pass 100,"I passed the exam a couple of weeks ago. I bought 3 books in all, and this was the best of them; yet I wouldn't have bought any of them if I knew what I know now about the exam. (I bought 3 because they all seemed to have different ways to cover the information.) The only thing really worth reading is the case studies in the beginning of the book. The best thing is to download the demo exam from MS and take your time answering the questions. Good Luck!"
3,"Covers material, needs to lose the attitude","I used this book as a supplement to the New Riders text that was my primary study tool. Despite the snotty attitude conveyed by the author in the answers to some of the practice questions, I found the material to be relevant, especially the difficulty of the case studies and the chapters on specific Microsoft technologies. The case studies forced you to read very carefully to answer the questions correctly, which I found was one of the biggest challenges on the real exam.I passed the exam on the first try, thanks largely to the Transcender exams pointing out where I needed to pay more attention in my studies. I found that the New Riders book covered the business requirements, database design, logical and physical design with more depth than this text, but this one has the edge in explaining the relevant Microsoft-specific technologies."
1,Arrogant and Irrelevant,"I have seen some poorly-written books in my time. But this one has outdone them all. The title should have been ""MCSD for those who want to feel like dummies."" The atitude of the author is arrogant and degrading to say the least. This might have been tolerable if the material was actually relevant to the exam. But this is not the case. And worse yet, it adds nothing to your knowledge but a cloud of incoherent thoughts and big acronyms (plus the high blood pressure and the urge to assert your IQ of course.)The case studies -- which are the bulk of the 70-100 exam -- are poorly chosen and the solutions are unhelpful. I don't know about you but the phrase ""If you answered so and so, then you weren't paying attention to much of anything"" doesn't constitute a good explaination to me. And I could have sworn that that same phrase came about more than 20 times throughout the book."
1,Worst technical book I have seen in a long time,"This book fails in a bad way. It needs to analyze the requirements of the reader and then present that solution (a new book). The scenarios are full of errors and editorial shortcomings and lack consistency in their approach. Statements like ""this answer is obvious"" help rationalize many answer explanations. The author's whimsical comments are nothing short of irritating and seem only to fill in gaps that could be used to present an erudite exposition of the subject at hand. If you are concerned with learning something besides what might be on the test, books like Instant UML offer a detailed and professional perspective on business analysis and requirements. But any good modeling books will provide the context and basis for analysis through implementation. The only reason this book gets one star is because its glossary is adequate."
2,Transcender - YES - Ezzell - No,"I found this book full of errors, weird unrelated opinions, and pretty much useless for 70-100; Transcender is MUCH closer to the test and points you at the right places to get the right info for your questions."
1,nodda,"Unfortunately, this book does not prepare you for the exam. The book contains a lot of redundant material and leads you into a lot of areas not necessary for writing the exam. The case studies were the only part of the guide that were worth using but his answers were confusing and condescending at times. In addition, the questions the cases present are not fully explained in the book.Definately NOT for the 70-100 exam."
5,The next step for the person who knows sun salutation,"Shiva Rea teaches at Sacred Movement in Santa Monica and does workshops around the country. After attending her workshop I needed a more regular experience of her enthusiasm, presence, and serious wisdom. While this CD is more a reminder of the experience than the experience, you'll still work hard and then find deep peace. The chanting / Om part unexpectedly opened my chest and allowed for my breath to really vibrate deep in my chest while doing asanas. Very cool."
5,Great overview on Vampires,"This A and E presentation on Vampires hits the mark with its expose on the vampire Legend and how this dark character has gone from being a supersticious menace to a fictional phenomenon. The documentary traces the beginningss of the vampire legend, tells of believed accounts of actual vampire attacks, of dug up graves which held in tac none decaying bodies and of vampire hunters and their kits. It then goes on to debunk the beliefs that actual vampires could exist and finally addresses the vampire in the 20th century as depicted in books and films; Anne rice makes an appearance along with footage of old vampire films. Excellent imagery and great narration make this video a great addition to your documentary collection. Highly recommended."
3,Good but not great.,"I love A23, but IMO, this is not the best A23 album in circulation. To be honest it's one of his least imaginative albums yet. There are some good soongs on the album that would please any fan of future pop music, sadley this just isn't up to par with the classic A23 album 'Failure', or his 2007 masterpeice 'Meta'. If your new to A23, i strongly suggest that you start with one of those albums instead."
5,Assemblage 23 - Defiance,"I happened upon this amazing release purely by timing. Having never heard of Assemblage 23, I of course never sought out any releases, that is until a complete stranger mentioned the project in passing. Later that week while searching through a use CD store's racks, I came across Defiance and decided to give it a go. And I am quite glad I did. This is electronic music with a heart and soul. Passionate and moving, this release was filled start to finish with stand-out tracks. This album delivers whether at home or on the dance floor. Tom Shear has immense talent and I have not been disappointed by him yet, Assemblage 23 is easily the most consistantly excellent EBM acts in the market today. I highly recommend this album."
1,EBM = Dance music for the simple minded,"I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend anybody, but to say that the best Artists that EBM has to offer are 2-Dimentional would be giving them too much credit. I thought I saw a wee bit of hope in Assemblage 23's Failure, but then he came out with this garbage. Failure would be a better suited title for this album...If anyone is interested in listening to Intelligent Dance music filled with Depth and Emotion, I highly suggest looking into PsyTrance (often referred to as the next evolutionary step from EBM/Industrial)... The debut album from Eskimo would be a good start."
4,uplifting?,"is it just me or is this quite a step towards positive, as compared to the depressive contempt and failure? i actually like this cd the best out of all 3 albums. he voice seems to have finally lifted and doesnt sound so much like a robot anymore!"
5,Another MASTERPIECE by Tom Shear,"I didn't think that Tom Shear could match what he accomplished with ""Failure"", but he did not ""dissapoint"" me . This album is as good as ""Failure"" if not better.EBM at its finnest.......Tom is the king when it comes to EBM.His powerful, personal and emotional lyrics affect me deeply.There are lots of up tempo club favorates like ""Opened"", ""Document"", ""Light"", ""Drive"", ""Fallen Down"", and ""Maps of Reality"" that are just fantastic.There is not a song in this album that I don't consider a smashing hit. Don't let me forget songs like ""Blindhammer"", ""Cocoon"", ""Horizon"", and Lullaby"" that are more low tempo and just mezmorizing.Once again, Tom Shear delivers another ""MASTERPIECE"""
2,Cheap Clasp,"I bought this necklace to replace my sister's old one that I broke; and she was disappointed when she found out that the clasp did not work. It didn't snap back like it should, and she was surprised because this necklace was a $7.99 one, not a 1 dollar one. The silver tone looks a little too fake, but the heart is very pretty, she says."
3,"Onward, Christian Readers!","I'm not really a ""scholar,"" but I can't help but ""think"" that Feuerbach is being deliberately vague and self-contradictory. My men's group read this for the month of February, and we all disagree with him that ""Love"" is ""God""--if this were (epistomologically) ""true,"" why would we write ""Love"" at the end of letters? Wouldn't we just write ""God""? Guten nacht, Ludwig!"
1,Very Bad Edition,"Do not buy this edition; there is no bibliographic information in the text, no mention of who the translator or publisher of the work is. Throughout there are glaring typographical mistakes, in which 'I' has been replaced with '1', and other issues. These issues make it seem as though this was a scan-to-text that was not carefully edited. I'm not even sure this is a legal printing of the work.Here's a fine, legitimate edition of the book:The Essence of Christianity (Great Books in Philosophy)."
1,"great book, LOUSY edition","This edition does a great disservice to a valuable work of philosophy. The edition lacks any of the normal publication information (translator, publisher, date, etc.), lacks page numbers (!) for the author's Intro, and has typographical errors throughout. It is totally unacceptable as an edition of a scholarly work. There are many better alternatives -- indeed, it would be difficult to find a worse edition."
5,Entertaining for your little ranger!,My five year old loves this video. We own both the Jungle Fury tapes and he watches them all the time. The video is 135 minutes long which is over 2 hours. They are a bundh of episodes back to back that take you through the fights with the Dai Shi.
3,"What, no ending?","I liked the DVD, but it lacks special features. I really hope Disney releases at least one more volume to wrap up the storyline."
2,25 % of the book is not usable,The title of the book promises software to aid in software measurement. Unfortunately the software installation is poorly designed. This makes installation diffucult if not impossible. The software support that is mentioned in the book is nonexistent and unresponsive. I don't recommend the book.
5,No regrets on this purchase,"I bought my PM66 10 years ago and use it often. Only problem was a bad bearing from the factory which I noticed on first start and it was immediately replaced at no charge or effort on my part ( those things happen on occasion even with the best equipment). I made a few minor adjustments and leveled the machine on my uneven shop floor. It runs smooth and very quiet compared to my old Craftsman. I get spot on accuracy even off the gauge on the fence, couldn't do that with my old saw and haven't had to re-align the blade or fence on the 66. I bought my 66 with the 50"" extension and a drop down roller outfeed. I recommend both if you handle large sheets of plywood solo. Now if I can just get the operator to perform as well as the saw."
2,Unfortunate experience,"I had many problems with this saw because of defective parts. The fence rail was bent, the table top was not flat (out 5/32"" from side to side). The material on the side of the fence was cupped. Powermatic service did replace all these parts but this isn't where the problems ended. After set up finally was complete,I powered the saw up and a great deal of vibration occurred. Come to find out when the machine was manufactured the set screw on the drive pulley for the blade was missing.So the pulley was drifting on the shaft. Easy fix but by this time I thinkin' lemon. I could write a 100 pages of adjustments and problems I have had with this thing but I will spare you all the details. Just to let you know a little background on myself is I'm a mechanical engineer and have a great deal of understanding when it comes to equipment. This is not what I had expected from Powermatic"
3,"Good, but missing angled option","This machine cuts straight mortises very well. However, if you are like most woodworkers you will have to cut angled mortises eventually. This machine will not do it.So, now when I have to cut an angled mortise I have to make a Jig for it. A royal pain..I wish I'd spent some more time researching. I probably would have bought a machine that does angled mortises as well."
4,minty fun!,"Bought this for hubby dearest and he loves it. It really wakes you up (it does tend to sting, so be careful when you use it!!!). I would use the soap on hot summer days rather than in the dead of winter like we'd been doing...it can leave you feeling pretty cold after a shower!"
2,Not what I expected,"Was hoping at that price the mint would stay with your skin. It doesn't. Makes your bathroom smell good,that's about it. Can do that cheaper."
5,THIS SOAP IS FABULOUS!!!,"I LOVE IT. EVERYONE I GIVE IT TO LOVES IT. THIS SOAP IS SO REFRESHING. IT'S ALSO VERY ECONOMICAL, THIS IS A HUGE BAR AND LASTS FOREVER. HARD MILLED SOAP."
5,Best lubricant I have found,Searched through many products and I think this is the best on the market. And the spray is very convenient.
4,Casio Watch,"The watch looks good, functions well and arrived ahead of schedule. Easy to use and a size that doesn't catch on things when you are working on projects. My only observation is that the digital screen at the bottom is small and somewhat difficult to read."
1,A Coffee Table Book,"This is a nice coffee table book but short on content if you are looking for any real information on the history of Chrysler and the related marques.You can't cover all that history in a large print book with a few color photos. I was looking for production numbers, VIN codes, engine information. Almost none of that here.If you are buying a gift for a Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth or DeSoto fan, this is not the book. They will already know more than you find here. If you want a few excellent photos and not much content, this is your book."
2,"Eh, not so good fantasy","A rather dull sequel, but a reader if you read the previous book. I don't really like the wolf-boy concept, it's so 80s. Nothing much of a book, slow plot, not so exciting misadventures, not really recommended."
5,Will Shetterly is a story-teller.,"The character of Ron is deeply human, deeply sympathetic, and deeply interesting. Will Shetterly tells a story that is a worthy sequel to ""Elsewhere."" The pacing makes it a page-turner; each of us can recognize ourselves in all of the characters and varieties of characters. ""Never Never"" is just what a young adult book should be. It engages the sympathies of the reader, illuminates the ambiguity of reality, and widens the reader's horizon."
5,Excellent Picture Quality,"I first bought a Canon PowerShot S200 and returned it bucause of the poor picture quality (I have a review for it too). I then bought the Fuji FinePix 2600. The major factors I considered is the ISO 100 rating, the 1600x1200 resolution, and the low price. After taking more than one hundred pictures under different conditions(indoor, outdoor, low light), I am very satisfied with the camera. The pictures are very well focused and very sharp. The colors are very real and vivid. The noise of the picture is very low. It is really hard to find a bad picture. I can hardly believe it that the picture quality can be so good. I was a little reluctant at the beginning to buy this camera because of its little bit bigger size. Now with such good picture quality the size is not a problem at all."
2,"Outdoors OK, Indoors, FORGET IT!","Takes great shots outside. But, If you want to take indoor pictures using the built-in flash, you will need to be less than 10 feet away from the subject.Not usable at all past that.Sure wish someone had told ME before I spent THAT much for it."
5,Best Value for the Money,After a lot of research and trying several other models I decided to buy this camera. I did not find anything in the price range with as many features. Everything you need to get started is included.I use it for a general purpose snapshot camera and have been extremely pleased with the results.
4,Fuji 2600 - A good Buy,"I was shopping for a 3 megapixel camera but after reading the specs on this unit and associated reviews, accepted the 2.1 megapixel in favor of a better lens system (and stay in my price range). Great camera takes excellent pictures, small and rugged. Limited to 2X, would prefer 3X. Lens cover has annoying habit of nudging closed while I am operating. Software is a little overdone. All-in-all a good buy, versital, convenient and good kick around camera for vacation use."
4,Better deal on a good camera.,"As the price has fallen on this camera, Fuji has become a better competitor in this crowded field. The 2600 has some nice features, but virtually none that most every other camera in this range doesn't have. On the down side, the feel is a bit flimsy and the controls are fairly limited (it is pretty much an automatic-only camera). Most annoyingly, especially if you're used to the Olympus clamshell design, this camera can be closed without shutting off the power, making it a bit of a battery-killer. Anyway, it's not a bad camera, it's just not an outstanding one. For the same price, I'd prefer the Nikon 775."
4,Better than fuji 2650,"This camera is better than the Fuji Finepix 2650.It takes better pics, the LCD is bigger and is faster than the other one.I have both and I thought 2650 should be better. I was wrong.Besides, the Fuji Finepix 2650 uses xD cards for storage, more expensive and slower.I like everything in this camera, great pictures. It comes even with rechargable batteries and a charger.My only complaint: in sunny days it's imposible to see the LCD, imposible :-("
2,BEWARE: Flimsy Battery Door [$] to Replace Under Warranty!!!,"After three months of moderate use, the metal component that holds down the batteries in the camera snapped off. Without this in place, the battery door cracked (from the inside out) under the pressure of the batteries. After sending the camera to Fuji for repairs, they sent me a bill for [$]! They said it was an impact crack which is not covered under their marginal warranty.I asked the gentleman at the call center if they would have repaired it free of charge, if I had sent it to them when just the metal component had cracked off. He said probably. Since that component breaking off in the first place was to blame for the cracking I am baffled as to why I had to pay a quarter of the original cost of the camera to have it repaired.It was a great camera, with the exception of this design flaw. AND IT IS A DESIGN FLAW, regardless of what the folks at Fuji say!"
5,Love This Camera!,"I never was one for taking pictures (except of my grandkids) but being a techie, I decided to get a digital camera. After reading all the reviews, I decided on the Fuji 2600. It is great. It takes beautiful pictures, and I love the fact that I can take pictures, view them instantly and then upload them onto the computer and send them out to my friends and family. I did buy a SmartMedia card reader so I am not constantly using the batteries. This makes it very easy to get the pictures on the computer. Pictures are sharp and clear, and actually the batteries seem to last quite a while before recharging. I'm not familiar with all the manual settings yet, but the automatic setting works for me. I couldn't ask for better pictures. I definitely recommend this camera!"
1,Used to love it but now bugs make it unusable!,"This was a great camera when I got it 1 1/2 years ago. I loved the size, the movie mode, and most of all the quality of pictures I could get from it. I always got lots of compliments on the quality of the pictures this took. Sure the indoor pictures on the camera were bad without flash but I could live with that because this camera had everything else...until then lens cover sensor malfunctioned. I did not drop the camera or even handle it rough at all (not even a scratch on it). Now everytime I try to take a shot the camera thinks the lens cover is closed and it retracts the lens. You will spend time setting up a shot, get it perfectly zoomed and then bzzzz there goes the lens! It is so annoying that I am going to get rid of this camera after battling with it for 4 months."
2,Spots,"Like camera, physically.Some of the photos have spots on them.Amazon.com sent a replacement within 2 weeks.Same problem, but not as many.Spoke to Fuji tech.Told me that sometimes they get a bad batch.When photos don't have spots, quality is great.Was able to print out some nice 5 x7'sBut you never know when the spots come up until you download the photos.Had same problem with an old Fuji MX 1200 years ago."
2,Not as Good as...,"I am disappointed. I purchased the 2400 and got the greatest picture quality,indoors and out. Gave it away and purchased the 2600. Photo quality is poor. It accidently turns on, I wish the smart card was placed somewhere else and not with the battery, the battery life is not that long. Only good feature is it's size. Neat and compact. Wish I was able to purchase the 2nd 2400."
4,Good Deal,"Hi, FolksI would like to recommend to purchase the Fuji FinePix 2600 2MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom by Fujifilm product.The price is reasonable for the consumer to choose, also the product is updated to the model and the market.The most important is the good image with the Fujifilm product for the excellent picture to the users.Lastly I highly suggest to the users that the most important thing is take notice of the light when you are taking the pictures. Otherwise is effect is not good for the pictures."
1,WORST camera there ever was! Get a Kodak (Z760 is awesome!) instead!,I used this fuji camera for about 4 or 5 years! I hated it from day one!! It is a pain in the rear.... and you don't get to change very many settings. The picture results most of the time are not even worth putting in the trash! This camera is garbage! Get a Kodak Z760.... you will be much happier!
1,NOT HAPPY,I rate this a 1 because I bought this 2 months ago and I stillcan not get my pictures to load on my PC.peggy
5,cheapest 2M pixel with 3x optical zoom but..,"turns out that it is a very good product. Some digital camera's LCD panel is not real time, you can see the time lag... but not this one.With the 35 dollars rebate, it is the best possible price for a 2M pixel camera with 3x optical zoom. And it is made in Japan, not some other countries in which I don't really trust the workmanship."
4,An excellent camera for the price,"This is an excellent camera, and it's quite versatile: can be used both as a digital camera and a web cam. The only (minor) two complains I have is: the shape of the camera; it's harder to hold than the old Fuji 1400, which is a 1.4MP camera I also have. The lens cover needs an extra push to get it in place to take a picture. Have said that, the camera image is wonderful outdoors, and the LCD is big and beatiful. I think it's very competitve comparing to lots of more expensive cameras for family style photos."
2,good for one year,"After a year of using it, it shuddenly stops retracting the lens, 'focus error'. I still don't know if it can be repaired (I took it to service yesterday), or how much will it cost...My advise is this: the camera is great, good pictures, easy of use. Think of it as a funny one-year toy.I was so happy with this camera that I even would consider buying Fujifilm again! At the same time, I feel very dissapointed because I never think that the camera would last so few time!"
4,Good buy!,"I love this camera. It's easy to use and good price too. It's charger and battery kit and 16MB card makes it better than competitor's 2M pixel offering. My only negative is the Smartmedia card, it should have been flash card since more people use flash cards. anyway, it's great camera."
2,quality/service problems with Fujifilm Finepix 2600,"I purchased the camera in July 2002. Although it basically works OK, I noticed from the beginning a large dark spot on every picture with a blue sky. So I contacted customer service in December 2002, who told me to return the camera. A replacement camera arrived after 1 month waiting. The replacement camera has an even worse problem : now the left corners are both dark on pictures of blue sky, walls etc....Needless to say that I am disappointed in this camera and the QC and service from Fujifilm"
1,Save Your $$$ Check Out OTHER Titles,"This was a complete waste of money. I have just finished making my own movie and Lloyd offered NOTHING much that was really helpful. The user's manual for your camcorder will give you more usable information on how to make a movie. I have been a fan of Toxic Avenger and Lloyd's crappy movies, but this set is not worth the money for what little educational value it offers."
2,A typical Kaufman work,If you can get past the brashness of Lloyd Kaufman it has some very good pointers behind the crude approach.The bottom line is Don't think just do it!I would not like to meet up with any of these people on a dark street either day or night.But all said and done. The Troma approach is tramatic. LOL
4,Entertaining!,"This is a very entertaining set of instructional DVDs. I would say the only downside is there is slightly more comedy than useful information, but that should not hold you back from purchasing. There really is a lot of very good and incredibly useful information in here, especially in the marketing/funding segment and tip for getting the best audio possible on a very low budget.It's just as enjoyable to watch as it is educational! Four out of five stars."
2,Not Quite As Cool as the Box Shows,"The Color Wonder Sprayer is easy to set up and use. However, the colors are very dull and take a long time to develop on the paper. Also, the sprayer sprays very broad strokes of color so it is impossible to create any specific detail on a picture. It works best for painting one page half one color and half another color. A little boring for long term use and not very creative."
4,Really Fun,"I bought this for my 7 year old son, and he really enjoys it. I do however wish that it came with more color for the sprayers and more paper. He ran out of both very quickly."
3,"Works, but no fun for Mom and Dad",My son liked this for a couple of sittings. After that didn't really care about it. It is work hassle for the parents then it's worth. Stick with crayons.
1,Postmaster postschtmaster,"This product is bogus. Nobody that works in the PO really likes their postmaster. The PO system is dominated by ass-kissers, suck ups, whiners, backstabbers, and adolescent adults. If there was a retirement book for the WORKERS who have taken 30 years of BS from their postmasters......hummmm....somebody might buy that!"
3,Jackie deserves better than this,"I can see Doug Carter is a fan. He has all the LPs. The problem is he's not a writer. A small book to begin with, Carter jumps from item to item without the least development, often repeating himself, never clarifying.He doesn't delve into the music at all; he doesn't shed light on anything that has made Jackie such an enchanting mystery to this day. ""Inteviews"" with people who knew Jackie all sound monosyllabically the same.I'm from Detroit, yet I saw Jackie only once. He means an awful lot to me. ""Lonely Teardrops"" is out of print so, despite the title (I find nothing in common between Jackie and Elvis), I thought I'd try Carter's book.Now I've gone back and found ""Teardrops"" has just ""limited availability."" I'm trying to get it now..."
4,The Black Elvis Jackie Wilson,"The Book gave a good insight into the life of a wonderful singer and entertainer. I took the time to read it thoroughly. The only thing I didn't like were the pictures that were so black you could not make out Jackie during the performances at all. They were not good pictures at all.Other than that, the book is well worth reading.I hope some day someone will put on a documentary of his life and music like they did for Sam Cooke and others. To this day we have not seen one singer come along since, with the talent that Jackie Wilson had.Ros"
1,The Black Elvis?,"I have not read this book yet, but it is so demeaning to a icon like Jackie Wilson to be called The Black Elvis. As if Jackie was good enough to be considered in the same league with Elvis Presley. That's not a compliment, that is an insult. I have never heard Elvis Presley being referred to as the White Jackie Wilson. Although Jackie and Elvis have often been compared to each other in their looks and style; Jackie Wilson was in a league all by himself and should never be considered on the back of anyone but himself; Mr. Excitement. Jackie would croon, spin around and do those outward splits and come back up so smooth as if someone had winded him up. I never knew Elvis to do anything close to that except shake his leg and fling his arms."
1,Not suitable for photo printing,"This paper is not suitable for photo printing - it is very thin, and the product description is very confusing, as it states that it is ""photo-quality."" The coating may be photo-quality, but paper weight is definitely not. I printed a test picture on this paper, and it wrinkled. I can only use it for large text printouts."
2,Not quite what I expected...,"I read the reviews but put more weight on the higher star ratings than the lower, I guess, and I was wrong. And at 25-cents a sheet it's not a very good value, either. Nowhere is the weight of the paper given, so I'd just assumed it was at least 20#, but it's much thinner than that. It's also a rather dull paper, not ""white"" which is not a big problem just an observation. I'll use this because it's here, but will probably use standard 24# 11x17 copy paper for most of my printing (posters and such) or buy from a local print shop. This is much too thin to use for handouts, however it will be fine to mount on poster board for school projects."
4,Very good for the price,"I've used this for larger photo prints for posting on the walls, etc. The paper isthin. You must handle it carefully so it does not crack the coated side of the paper.If you do that, you'll get quite decent color photos out of it. I use other Epsonphoto papers as well. They're thicker and produce really nice colors. And theycost over twice the price of this paper.I really like this paper for the almost poster size prints I can get for an inexpensiveprice. However, you've got to handle it carefully. It's thin and the coated sideneeds to be kept intact before printing.I give 4 stars for the price / quality quotient and plan on using this paper for quitesome time."
1,Cheap and Thin,"This paper, although stated as a good quality paper is not good for presentations.The fact that it is VERY think makes it very easy to be damaged.The slightest movement of the paper when placing it in the paper feed slot can easily dentthe photo. If you are looking to print stuff that you do not really care about so much thanthis paper is for you. If you are looking to print photographs that you may want to look goodthan DO NOT USE THIS PAPER. Use a 5 star rated paper. I have about 100 pages now of paper that Ido not want. The box states that this paper is thick, but it is not. And when comparing it to otherpapers the Premium papers are much better and more worth your money to buy."
3,Very Thin But Does The Job,"I thought that this paper would be thick since it is labelled for presentations but it is the weight of regular printer paper. The colors do look nice and vibrant on it though so if you don't need the weight, it is a good product for a good price."
1,Unacceptable,This is not presentation paper.It's no thicker than regular paper and it's not double-sidedHow can you do newsletters and flyers on single-sided paper?
2,Not all that applicable for the real 21st century now,"It would have been a good read if I had bought it in 2000, but not anymore. It still gives good basic information, but several things have changed since the book was written."
4,Everything You Need to Know,"This is a great how-to book for running a small business. For anyone that has started or is thinking about starting their own business, this book can help avoid costly mistakes. By taking the reader from business start-up to operations to formulating an exit strategy, the book should be a valuable reference tool on the desk of any small or inexperienced business owner. The book covers issues that are bound to come up that an owner never considered and it will likely provide sound advice. The author obviously has real-life business experience that he shares throughout the book with anecdotes and analogies.Overall, the writing style is very informal (a little too much so to my taste) that is easy to read. Not everything will apply to your business, but I would not open a new business without reading this again."
4,All Things to Consider in beginning a business,"This is amazing book. It touches on so many aspects of what is involved in getting an business up and running as well as relating those elements to who you are and the decisions you need to make.I found the goal setting process very meaningful.All along the way, it is obvious that the author is speaking from a wealth of personal experience. There are times when one wishes for more details or further information but to cover every aspect in greater depth would make this book two to three times as long and not very practical to the time strapped audience this book is meant to serve. As it is, it does an incredible job of raising all the issues and options that need to be considered as one considers the type of business to go into and how to make it successful."
1,stanley 1/16x6 inch punch,"I had to sand it down to fit in the punch hole, after that it worked fine. A little to much work for the price."
4,Little Troll Prince,I received the video immediately. The company has been very helpful and friendly. I will definitely shop there again.
4,Defensive Driving Reinforced,"Drive to Survive was one of just a few excellent reference sources for my safe driving CD ""Mind the Road -Mind the Road: Waking Hypnosis for a Conscious Commute. The advice and recommendations from this book were a practical inspiration for the suggestions my audio CD gives to drivers as they start their drive to have a safe and focused drive. I would recommend this book with my audio CD to help drivers be prepared for what potentials the road may present to them."
4,American conditions,"Hard to understand this book from the perspective of being a European. Quite a few of the scenarios described involve road rage that I am not exposed to in my area. Also, the comparison between the battle field and the streets is a little strong for me. But it gives me an impression about the conditions in the States.The book is OK for someone unfortunate to be exposed to a road rage infected environment, as well as for the totally unaware.For all of those lucky enough not to be exposed to violence on the streets, the book gives some smart tips of being more aware of your environment and how to detect a possible threat before it hits you."
5,Boo Nitty-Gritty,"Handsome book from the University of New Mexico Press. Trade paperback, 231 pp on heavy stock. 2 pounds.Illustrations throughout, almost all of them full page.With commentaries by Crow Tribal Members Barney Old Coyote Jr., Mardell Hogan Plainfeather, and Dean Curtis Bear Claw.Indexed. 22 pp of bibliographic information: narrative and bibliographic End Notes and a Bibliography.TABLE OF CONTENTSIntroductionIn the Right PlaceAn Indian Who Had No TribeA Citizen IndianA Photographic Legacy"
3,ABChe,"This Title is a funny and cartoon like biography for real fans of Latin American guerrila dreamers. It compiles the life of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara and goes into detail about his life and adventures as a Mercenary Commandant fighting together with revolutionary groups trying to take overthrown non-communist Governments in Latin America and West Africa, with a special emphasis on his most important guerrilla trophy, the Cuban revolution. This is an easy and very Graphical edition specially made for readers that like to see pictures and letters and enjoy the combination of history and Comic-like stories relating to politics and popular propaganda."
3,"Great idea, but Very hard to assemble!","I bought this for my two dachshunds who were Florida dogs all their life, until last year when we moved to Idaho. It is a great idea and so far they have had no problem going in it. My only complaint is that is was VERY hard to assemble. I struggled getting the tent poles into place and also into the velcro closures. I also seem to be missing a loop for one of the tent stakes, but I made due with 3 and so far it seems to be holding. I would recommend this product, but be prepared for some difficult set up."
3,But will he use it?????,"We got the Poop Tent because our Bichon puppy is pretty particular about doing his business when it's wet out. So far, he has no interest in it. We're hoping that changes when the rain comes (and stays). We tried putting a PeePad inside (with some of his pee on it), but all he does is try to shred up the pad. Fingers crossed tho........."
2,Nice Wool but Not Left/Right Fit,"I bought this sock because I wanted a Left/Right specific sock. In the description it claims to be an Anatomical Fit, different for the left and right foot, but it is definitely not. I will go back to my only other Left/Right sock made by Keen Footwear."
3,"Not wild about it, but it is a decent book","I am a high school student and I read La Casa Embrujada as an extra credit assignment. The humor may be a little dry, but all around this is a nice book for high school students to read. In my spanish 3 class we are assigned to read Marianela, and let me tell you this book is sooooo much better (and easier to understand) than Marianela. I have read the preceeding book to La Casa Embrujada, entitled El Secuestrador. I enjoyed reading that book as well. I would reccomend this book to all spanish students that enjoy reading spanish literature."
3,Just got most of it,"I just received most of the saw, the fence rail is missing, it's on the way. I assembled the saw lined everything up, but it vibrates. I don't know how this thing can pass a nickel test. I lined the pulleys up with a 32 inch level so they are pretty dead on. I notice the motor shakes a bit on start up and shut down, does this change if I wire it for 230? Any other helpful hints on getting it to stop shaking will be helpful."
3,An Overrated Brand,"This is a good, relatively inexpensive cast iron table saw. And that is all that it is. The AMZN review by Nancy Gleason is misleading. Left tilt saws are better, but they are ubiquitous. Read the reviews. They are quite accurate and touch on many important aspects.It is curious that many reviewers make significant criticisms while indicating a very high rating. It is not unusual that this saw's top is not level, the splitter is difficult to adjust, the belt guard is infamous (and has been so for years w/o change), bolt holes are misaligned, and the blade is not parallel to the miter slots. If you are new to woodworking, please understand the importance of these elements."
2,It's Not a Delta,"I have been woodworking for many years(25?) and have owned one of these saws. The first thing I found is that I could NOT get the blade parallel with the miter guage slot! This is a critical adjustment! When I confronted the company with this problem, they told me ""the saw is within the tolerances for a saw of this quality."" In other words tough...If I were you, I would buy a Delta. They have made quality saw for years and I have owned several!"
2,Disappointed,"The first clue should have been that I had to elongate the holes to get the wing tables to an acceptable level of being level with the main table. The saw has vibrated badly no matter what I do to it. The scale on the fence has not stayed true. The guard (which is one of the reasons I chose this saw ) tends to pinch the stock as it is pushed through. The motor mount system is flimsy and hard to fine tune. Yes it is worlds better than a Sears 8"" bench saw, but this is a diffent class of saw. I expected a better product. In case you think I am just incomptent in set up. I used to be a tool and die maker and set dies to within .001 of an inch. Maybe I just got a lemmon. Maybe they just need to work on their Quality control."
2,"The other guy is right, Buy a DELTA","Has this saw now for two years, finally getting around to bad- mouthing this pile. Two nice things about it; heavey duty- cast table, accufence is great. Motor I think is weak. The rest is junk. I cant tell you how many times I've has this saw upside-down parts everywhere trying to get my blade adjustments to work smoothly. Maybe the freight co. dropped it but the blade height adjustment fights me the entire way up and down. I finally took the spiral gear apart and filed the teeth down. That seemed to make it better. If I had to do it all over again I'd buy a DELTA."
3,Some annoyances for an expensive saw,"This is generally a fine saw but there are a few annoyances too many for a [price] saw. The extension wings are warped so they cannot be level all the way across the table and the fence catches, the guard leaves black streaks on the cut material, the measuring tape on the fence tube came too far down the scale and I had to break down the whole saw to reconfigure it properly (about a days work), the wood extension wing is cheap particle board and spalled a bit requiring sanding and the belt guard wouldn't mount without rubbing the belt so it remains off today (not safe). It was these small things that get annoying. But the cut is very true and the fence is excellent. The tilt guide needed no adjustment and the instructions were pretty good for assembly. I'll own the saw until it dies, but it was not a great experience for the first month."
3,"price is right, power is needed","the saw assembled fairly easily and looked good when completed. everything seemed to be plumb. the shipping materials don't quite protect part of the trunnion assembly so it's possible for there to be damage there which would cause a misalignment in the set up. the machine did not come with a blade, i bought a freud. cutting was fine, but the saw lugged when i was attempting to cut thick material. all things considered i would probably buy the small 66 and pay the extra money next time."
1,Spoken Albanian,"Maybe this book is not the worst, but it is far from the best, too.A weak point is that the lessons at the end of each unit have no parallel English texts, unlike the phrases at the beginning. Moreover, not all units are recorder on the tapes. And what is most awful, the quality of some tapes is disgusting. I ordered this item, then replaced it, but the second time it was even worse - absolutely nothing was heard from the first tape. That is why I returned the textbook for the second time.Maybe COLLOQUIAL ALBANIAN represents the Kosovo dialect, but it is better, in this case. I also would recommend the short dialogues from 101 Languages of the World. There is also PILMSEUR ALBANIAN, which I do not know, and only hope it is good.Why did Amazon send me this 2 times, without checking the quality of the tapes? I am very disappointed."
3,Fun reading but not technically informative.,"Mr. Crismon's Modern US Military Vehicles is a fun book to browse through. However, its technical information and photographic quality is disappointing. This book does not compare favorably to the 2 previous books in this series, the wonderfully informative- US Military Wheeled Vehicles and US Military Tracked Vehicles."
2,Very disappointed,"If you are into military wheel vehicles, then this book is ok. I'm not into motorcycles, fire engines, dump trucks and cargo vehicles. Even then, the author tries to cover too much for this short book.There are no color photos, no line diagrams. Very little time or space devoted to tanks, or armor vehicles. 17 pages to be exact.I bought this thinking it would have more coverage about the M-8 Armor Gun System. It does have some photos and brief descriptions of some unusual military vehicles, but I cannot recommend this book."
4,Organizing Paper,"The Printer Dock is fabulous for organizing your home printer's paper products. The four sections allow me to separate white paper, colored paper, labels, and photo paper. Construction of the Dock is durable. Size is perfect. Appearance-wise, not very attractive with my home office furniture but serves the purpose. All-in-all, it is a good purchase for someone who likes organization."
1,Disappointed.,"I started using this product in mid-January. After almost 4 months of taking 2 capsules per day I see zero change in my skin, which is the main reason for using the collagen. Also, I notice some reviewers say it has helped with joint pain, but I have experienced no change or improvement whatsoever. Disappointed..."
2,Poor Quality Product,"This product is attractive, but poor quality. Rec'd 2 sets. Set # 1 had a small crack in one of the beveled squares. Set # 2 one of the sconces was secured to mirror crooked. Since these are not going to be in high traffic areas of my home I decided to keep. There are very few modern/contemporary choices in a reasonable price range and they do work well with my decor. Shipping is higher than necessary. Seller still makes a profit when item is returned."
4,Cute earrings,"Citrine stone is nice size, garnet very small. Earrings very small but for price, can't beat them."
5,I was smarter than I thought!,"When I first saw this book, I thought to myself, ""I'm an adult learner. Adult learners don't learn as quickly or as well as children.""I was wrong. This book showed me that I can learn by using the method most suited for me. By a series of questions and readings, a person can find out what learning type he or she is and what kind of system will work best. The system teaches how information is recepted in the best way for each individual, how to organize it, and how it can be retained. It even helps with test anxiety.I recommend this book to all adult learners who, like me, think they are too old to go back to school. Thanks, Ms. Masters."
2,Just OK,"From what I read online I was expecting something spectacular. I was disappointed in this book. It does give some good tips on how to improve your studying but basically nothing more than the online personality or learning style quizzes suggest. Don't waste your money, just do some research online and you will be able to gather the information that this book supplies without throwing money down the drain."
4,I really am smarter than I thought!,"This is a very helpful book. I started using it about a month ago, and it has already made me feel much better about college. My mom, who is a high school English teacher, is also planning on using it to supplement her classes."
5,Throwin my clothes out the window so when the wind blows I see my polos n timbos,"The only thing I didn't like was that the bottom of the boots were sticky, other than that my favorite timbos"
5,Excellent Timberland Men's Windchill Chukka boats,This was the perfect pair of boats I ever purchased for my son. These boats looks Great with anything he wears. I highly reccomend this product for any male who wants to look good at all times.
5,My husband was thrilled!,"My husband was thrilled! As a city bus driver, he's very particular about his in-between seasons boots. He doesn't want them too high, and the soles must be sturdy. The boots must be comfortable, wear well, and look good. So far, so good.When our daughter told him they were the same boots that Tupac made famous, that gave him an extra edge of the coolness factor that a 60-year-old doesn't normally enjoy."
2,"Great to hear some old familiar songs, but songs to short.","Many of the songs listed were amoung my favorites, I was so excited to hear this CD. But when I recieved it. Each song listed only has a verse or two and is part of a 3-4 song blend all crammed into a 4 minute song track. So you really don't get the full enjoyment of the whole song. You only get about a minute of each song. The rendition of danny boy was terrible. The song has a terrible background music you'd find on an electric piano keyboard under cheesey DANCE beat. Seriously a dance beat to Dannyboy? Other than the dannyboy fiasco and the briefness of each song grouped on each track, the music was pretty good, I loved hearing all the songs my grandfather and his brothers would sing, like Moonshiner. But I would prefer to listen to the full version of my favorite pub songs. Not the condensed combinations of one or two versus of several songs crammed into one track on the cd. The songs just didn't flow. I'd recommend a different CD."
5,Real Irish songs,"All of the Sean O'Neill Band albums capture the true ""spirit"" of Irish music. They offer many hours of enjoyment which never gets old. I listen to them all year long."
4,"Good scholarship, well chosen reproductions","If you're looking for a collection of reproductions of Michelangelo's drawings, there are about 200 in this book. The accompanying scholarship provides good insights. I always prefer some illustrations to be side-by-side with text, so as to do less flipping back and forth, but the inconvenience is excusable."
2,Suspending disbelief doesn't begin to describe it,"The premise is certainly interesting, that UFOs are the creation of a brilliant, if ruthless, man and not extra terrestial in nature. Harbinson also keeps the book moving swiftly along.I stuck with the series until mid way through the second book but in the end couldn't stomach it any more. It just got too silly. By the time the severed head (which had lived for 12 years from the early 50s) made ESP contact with an ESP soldier via a psychic and projected his vision onto tv screens I'd had enough.Science fiction I love, science coddswallop I don't"
4,Beautiful Book,"The pictures in this book provide a real sence as to what the romanticized cuba looks like. It dosn't provide much true insight to the everday feeling's and life like it should though. It is still a beautiful book, and I am glad I bought it."
1,It really is annoying!,"I thought I would find myself laughing and having fun, but I got irritated instead. I played this only once and couldn't wait to be finished. It's like UNO, only longer and much less fun."
3,Fun and Silly,"Sorry, Card Revenge Game is fun and silly - it's a good spin on the original Sorry game"
2,Disappointing,"This game has too many rules, is too confusing, and the voice is SO IRRATING. What is with this years' electronics? Where are they finding these annoying voices? I don't understand all the great reviews on this game. Don't buy it."
3,Good high level view but is now - 1999 - dated.,"This book is good enough that it should be updated to include the major enterprise initiatives; e.g., ecommerce, the role of eforms in document management, etc.. In the rapid evolution of document automation technologies, 1995 was a very long time ago."
4,Delicious!!,"Listening Pearls is an indie label with a knack for discovering artists and groups that seem to fit nowhere. Such is Yonderboi. A Hungarian in origin, Yonderboi is a multitalent mixing triphop sounds with jazz and hip hop to deliver a beauty of an album comparable (in reference) with ver little out there..The spacy cover version of Riders on the storm speaks for itself but the album is actually full of trippy gems..Allthough this might not be music for the uninitiated the chances that someone with decent taste in music will not like it are very VERY dim!! Great stuff."
5,This Kid Rocks!,"This IS the best cd I own and I have alot. I downloaded some of these tracks of the internet but this 19 year old kid is so good I felt I had to buy his album, I seriously reccomend this if you like music."
1,Returned For Credit,This item was returned for credit. It seemed poorly constructed. The voltage power switch did not work properly and and seemed quite loose. I was not comfortable taking it on a recent trip to Ireland. As a side note ... every hotel and B&B during the 10 day trip provided a hair dryer in the room.
2,don't like the settings,"I wanted a small hairdryer to fit easily in a drawer. This is a nice compact dryer and is sturdy. There are two speed settings; low and high. High blows harder than low. I prefer to blowdry my hair on a lower velocity setting so I can style as I dry. The problem with this machine is that the low setting doesn't put out any heat. It just blows air. I still want to dry my hair, just not at a high wind velocity. I am disappointed."
5,folding hair dryer,Handy hook to hang hair dryer. Folding allows it to travel easily. Drys hair quickly. I needed a hair dryer to dry my hair quickly in cold weather. This one fits the bill and is very reasonably priced.
3,Not Compact,"This product was listed as compact, but it is definitely too large to be considered a ""Compact Travel Dryer"""
1,The only thing I don't like.,"The only thing I don't like about the Travel Dryer is the plug. I must carry an adapter because it is too big to fit into some sockets. I have been licky though, because the hotel had another I could use.SunBeam SBPC32 1600W Compact Travel Dryer"
5,EASY TO HANDLE,"THIS DRYER IS LIGHTWEIGHT AND EASY TO HANDLE. I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL FOR SURGERY, IT WAS PERFECT. I HAVE ARTHRITIS IN MY HANDS AND IT IS EASY TO HOLD."
2,"Liked it, but did not even last a year","This seemed like a fine little blow dryer until it started shooting sparks a couple of weeks ago. I had no complaints about this dryer, it did its job and was easy to pop into a suitcase or backpack for travel. Would have easily given it four or even five stars. There's really no excuse for a such poor quality appliance, even an inexpensive product should last at least one year. I bought it in April 2010. I won't purchase another Sunbeam hair dryer."
2,Lasted only 2 years and wasnt used everyday,Not a bad hair dryer only complaint was that it did not last 2 years. The high setting blew out and only low setting worked which would take a long time to dry my hair even though I have fine hair.
5,"It's math, it's history, it's a lot of fun","I watched this when it premiered on my local PBS affiliate and I thought it was a lot of fun and full of loads and loads of interesting history.As a world history teacher, I am always on the lookout for something that can tell our story with a twist. This one does it quite nicely.The documentary tells the story of man's use of one (and other numbers, but the focus always returns to the number 1) throughout time with a humorous twist. It explores early uses of math, why mankind had to develop math, why the Roman Numerals were inferior to our current system and continues on to the modern use of binary numbers.As soon as I saw it I knew I wanted it for my history class. It will be great as a different sort of review of the history that we have studied thus far.I give this one a grade of 'A'."
3,Story of 1,"Excellent, enjoyable story of ONE.The only item that disappointed me was that it is not close captioned, which is important to me and is somewhat unfathomable to me why and educational product would not be. So for content I rate it as a 5, but because of not captioning, I rate it as a 3."
4,Why include topless scene?,"This DVD provides an informative and entertaining way of teaching the history of math. I just don't understand why the view of the topless native woman was included. Yes, it is culturally appropirate. Still, this scene could have been eliminated and the story would have been just as complete. As it is, I'm still in the process of trying to get this approved for viewing at my highschool."
5,Very entertaining,"This is a very entertaining story of numbers, from their humble beginnings to how we use them today. It is very informative and I have used it in my classroom (6th-8th grades). It always gets them interested in binary!"
2,Okay,"This dvd was more elementary than I thought it was going to be. Good for maybe elementary or middle school students, but not high school."
2,Great doc with one crippling flaw,"While this documentary has great educational value and could probably hold the attention of a high school class it has one crippling flaw that is a deal breaker. There is a fleeting shot of a topless African native. While this is done tastefully, similarly to a Nat Geo documentary, the political realities of education make this incredibly problematic as some parents are sensitive to the very idea and would label it as a teacher showing ""pornography."""
3,Mixed thoughts,"This Cd is an odd mix of tastes.The songs that are sung by the female member of this group are catchy & well worth the listen, but the ones sung by the deep voiced male are really out of place on this CD. I personally didn't find them interesting or worth a second pass.I would pass on the CD & go straight for the download of the six better songs on this ""Project C_D"""
1,Old Information,"This book was written before the new drugs for MS. The info in it is dated with some advice that could be harmful if using one of the new drugs such as rebif, avonex, etc. You do not want to rev up your immune system. It is already working overtime destroying your myelin. Try one of the newer books like MS - The First Year by Margaret Blackstone. Also, Teri Garrs book and Fall Down Laughing are good."
4,Finally found a Tree Swing!,"It was not easy to find a swing for a tree for a 3-4 year old! It took me a lot of searching to find this swing, so even though it wasn't long enough, we rigged more strong rope to the top and got it to work.It is a nice design and works fine. It was fairly easy to set up to use and it is pretty. Once the swing is attached to the tree, you can adujust the length with the rope that goes througth the lady bugs at the side.We didn't want to get a whole swing set, so it was very hard to find just a wooden swing ( on the net and in stores) so we decided to buy it since making one would have cost about the same and taken a lot more time!I recommend this for ages 3 and up. It's a great way to swing from the tree...stay low or go really high! Nothing beats a swing in the shade! -Suzanne"
1,not a safe product,"I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter, who was very excited to have a swing in the back yard. It soon turned to disappointment. The ropes continually slid down to the longest adjustment and could not be adjusted to the desired height. We spent alot of time fiddling around at the tree limb to get it the right height, but the ropes seemd to stretch no matter what we did. The seat dumped her on the ground one to many times- flat on her back and almost striking her head. It now sits in my shed. She is not an uncoordinated child."
2,How Long Do You Want It For?,"Came swiftly with easy set up. Looks just like the picture.....for 2 1/2 months. This & the ladybug one do not hold up to weather. After 2 months, the pressed wood that makes up the seat began to separate, peel, & break off. Sadly no longer usable. Cute? Yes. A good buy? If you like to purchase outdoor toys like boxes of disposable diapers. Simply buy, use, & toss away...... :/"
1,Difficult to use,This product is cute but that is the only good part. The rope slips when you adjust the length and my child can't stay seated on the slick seat surface.
1,Bigtime Bummer,"My 4-year-old son was so excited helping daddy put up the bolts to hang this swing from a beam in our house. He thought it was beautiful. Then we discovered that no matter what we tried, no adjustments would hold. At it's full length it hung about 2"" off the floor, obviously not a good idea. I was faced with needing to find another swing while he was at school to avoid the heart break of taking his brand new swing away.Unless you want to have a huge project on your hands trying to make this work, don't buy it!"
5,A very good textbook to lear Macroeconomics,"Although this book is an intermediate textbook for macroeconomics, it is more integrated and analytical than other similar textbooks. The book seems a little harder to read than some books, but it can provide you a more solid background and a better understanding for macroeconomics. It has very clear theme underlying the book: first lets you know the models and then tells you how to use the models to analyze the macroeconomic problems. keynesian theory is the focus of the book. Finallly, if the book can include more case study, it would be better."
1,"Classic ""Junk Science""","The author twists scientific data to draw the ludicrous conclusion that simply living within 50-100 miles of a commercial nuclear facility ""may"" cause the following: AIDS, low birthweight babies, low intelligence, blood poisoning, crime, and violent deaths. It is interesting to note the authors repeated use of the word ""may"" instead of ""are"". Irresponsible conclusions based on hyperbolic distortions of data to scare the public into supporting the authors anti-nuclear position, this book is not worth the time to read. Sorry I took the time to read it."
1,Smell that? I think it's radiation.....,"This guy had a conclusion in mind and looked for the ""statistics"" to prove it. Sadly, real science is the other way around.Here's a better idea: watch what you eat, don't smoke, and wear your seatbelt. The stress books like these try to create kills innumerably more than the radiation ever will."
3,In Response to Comments by Others,"A reader should consider the possibility that Marias' introduction to the book is also fictive, including the details about commissions."
2,Climactic Pre-climax,"Javier Marías embraces apparently trivial situations and augments their attention value by emphasizing what goes through people's minds prior to engaging in thoroughly climactic experiences, such as killing one's boss or breaking into the world of pornography. Suspense keeps building up, but then it dissolves. After reading a couple of these stories one gets a hold of the trend and expects no suspense breaking. A few tales later the book becomes obviously boring."
2,Problems with recorded disks,"It plays commercial DVDs properly but it is often incapable of playing or recognizing those it has burned itself. I just tried to record two programs and got ""disk error"" as soon as I pressed the stop button. In other cases, I have gotten ""unknown data"" or ""empty disk"" for freshly-recorded DVDs.Cleaning the disks helps in a minority of the cases. I have probably wasted twenty or more recordable DVDs (and I have no idea of how many finalized ones are actually playable). The directions (page 8) warn against trying to clean the DVD player's lens because the optical unit is more delicate than those in read-only DVDs."
4,Pretty helpful and a great tool,"This book was very good, helpful and useful. I'm keeping it in my study room as a tool to help me with my creative writing on the subject of sexual abuse."
4,Amazing,"This book is juts... AMAZING. I had the oportunity to read this book long time ago. I am trying to buy it again, so I can read it again. I really recomended this book."
4,Awesome,"It's about an hour's worth of music and the songs are kinda short. The CD is freakin' expensive so I would buy it if you find it and get the feeling that you must have it; like I did. Love the music! Not loud on the MP3 or if you're playing a game that supports custom soundtrack sooo use a stereo. The internet ""tube"" has the songs so you can try before you buy..."
1,Lousy quality control,"I bought one of these last year. I loved the small size; I like to carry my phone in my shirt pocket always. One the first one you had to tap the base every morning (sometimes more often) or you couldn't hear the other party (they could hear you though). A loose connection. The battery failed within a year. When the headset socket wore out (really) I wanted to buy another type phone. None were as small so I bought another one of these. I had awful clicking on it all the time. It had to go right back. Quality control at Vtech is nonexistent. I bought a Panasonic 2.4 Ghz DSS and it works great, just too big, although the same weight as the Vtech. A tip for shirt users; wrap a rubber band around the clip so it grabs onto your shirt and doesn't fall off when you bend over."
1,Perhaps better off with another phone,"I purchased this phone as a Christmas gift. I'm disappointed I wasted my time and money with it. The sound clarity was poor- static only a few feet from the base with a clear line of sight to it. It had an echo sound frequently as well. The handset is very small, too small. People with hands just a little larger than normal may not find it comfortable to use. It also doesn't cradle well against the shoulder when trying to talk and use both hands for something else (ie: a 2 year old running around!) Now I must go return it for a refund."
1,Fake deodorant!!!!!!,I got this deodarant while opened by homeland security. I did not know it was coming from overseas. My husband told me not to use it but I decided to use it and got bumps which are very painful. I stop using it and put in trash.
4,Happy with this alarm clock.,Great performance for the price. The FM antenna built into the power cord pulls in stations that are not received on any other FM receiver in our home. The dual alarm function was the selling feature for us and the easy 24 hour reset button is a plus.
5,Philips Am/FM Dual Alarm/Radio is a Classy bedside addition.,"I'm very glad that I purchased this clock/radio, mainly because of it's attractive design. It looks great both in the dark and in the daytime. At night, the digital time is displayed in amber numbers which are just the right size. In the daytime, the time is displayed with the same numbers, but the front surface of the clock is reflective. The controls for the radio and alarm are all around the top and the sides of the clock, and can't be seen at first glance. The clock has an elegance which would compliment most decors."
1,Battery back-up is a lie NO ALARM AT ALL WITH POWER FAILURE,"I'd say the most basic feature in an alarm clock should be that it will still sound an alarm even if the power is out. That battery back-up feature is why I bought this clock. It says it has such a feature on the box, in the Amazon description, and in the customer reviews. HOWEVER - Read the battery door cover, the instructions, and you'll find the battery is for the clock memory only. I tested the unit to be sure. NO ALARM AT ALL WITH POWER FAILURE. Sure the alarm will sound as soon as the power is restored but who knows when that will be. Too me, that renders the clock worthless."
4,"Overall good, stylish -- buttons can be improved","The clock looks cool and the front can serve as a mirror. The dual alarm feature is very useful -- I can set two alarms, one for myself and the other for my wife. You also have choice to set the alarms to either beep or radio.However, the switches on the left side are quite awkward. Whenever I switch them to set alarm or time, my other fingers always accidentally touch the top buttons and active the radio -- sometimes wakes up my wife, not cool :("
2,cost too much,this puzzle cost way too much for the size. it's especially too much once you add on shipping charges. really check the dimensions before you buy.
5,Baby Einstein: On the Farm Book and CD,My 3-year-old grandson has been enjoying his copy since he was one. It is enjoyable on many levels and teaches many skills.
2,less isn't always more,"A teeny little plastic bag of thin little plastic ""winks,"" that's all. I thought I was getting everything in the picture. Oops."
3,Let's lawyers off too easily,"I was really looking forward to ""Brain Storm"" but was disappointed. I agree with previous comments about the style and dialogue, which I found lacked texture and variety. But the worst flaw was that the book was simply not satirical enough. As a confirmed lawyer-hater, I was expecting jokes that were both funnier and more incisive. This is not to condemn the novel, which is a solid, workmanlike product. It simply isn't excellent.Incidentally, Dooling has written a nonfiction book attacking hate-crimes laws and this book casts the issue into fictional form."
2,Poor and long winded effort.,"Boy, did this long-winded book need some editing. If I had to suffer through any more sections on how the main character was just ""some Westlaw geek"" I thought I would choke. Gave up after about sixty pages because only about five pages of plot had occurred. This guy just tries too hard to let you know how up he is on ""contemporary"" stuff.PS I suspect some of the reviews are from the author himself."
1,Just awful!,"This book is silly in the extreme. None of its characters is likable; the plot requires a tortured suspension of disbelief; Dooling misleads the reader with his descriptions of courts and his analysis of legal issues; and, worst of all, is sophomoric in its treatment of sex and sexual issues. To paraphrase George Bernard Shaw's review of a symphony he attended, the best chapter in this book is the last -- by then the reader knows the ordeal will soon be over."
2,Good idea poorly executed,"This could have been a terrific book. The plot is exciting, the characters intriguing. It's a shame it is so poorly written. The author has a difficult time with dialogue. All characters speak in the same wise-crack mode as the protagonist. He also has an unpleasant habit of including long discursive passages, the main purpose of which is to expound on his theories of human behavior rather than to advance the plot or develop the characters. And, ouch!, those sex scenes. Clearly not his long suit. Perhaps his editor suggested that he spice things up, and so he pasted these scenes in at the last minute.Perhaps he needs a new editor."
3,so-so near future lawyer novel never quite makes it,"While some reviews have found Brain Storm to be a witty twist to the standard lawyer novel, I found the humor to be forced. The author seems to be unsure if he is a novelist or humorist. The constant techno-speak, pushed to the max, while cute at first, became tiresome. The charactor to the Federal Judge was a delight."
3,Overrated. Much too simple.,"Don't waste your time. The science is poor. The plot is OK, but there are much better books out there!"
3,great elements but uneven execution,"The parts are greater than the sum in this interesting but disappointing novel. There are many rich strands -- characters, plot, narrative regarding law practice, law firms, lawyers and judges, and background regarding neurochemistry. But too many characters appear as central then disappear and the tone meanders too unevenly between hilarious satire and moderately engaging thriller for this to be an outstanding work. I found the underlying murder plot to be the weakest segment of the book --- I did enjoy this, though, and am looking forward to reading other books by this author."
5,"Hilarious, thoughtful, first rate","Here is a book with everything. A fast-moving legal thriller. A biting satire on the legal system that had me laughing so loudly my wife wondered what was going on. And a thoughtful look at two serious issues: what are hate crimes anyway, and are hate and violent behavior just a little problem with some grey cells out of place. Don't know why this book isn't on the best seller list; it is fresh, original and readable."
4,Just like i liked it,gives me the perfect curve in for my shoulder length bob. I will recommend this to anyone - just because it takes such a short time to blow dry hair
2,"Works, BUT","The product comes as described, HOWEVER what's missing in the description is how heavy, encumbered and loud it is. Have I tried it in a store, I would not have bought it. Still, it does the job."
2,Lasted for a little while...,"I bought it in December, it was awesome at first, but after nine months, not sure what happend, the comb attachment broke first and then there was a loud pop noise, I tried to turn it off but the button was stuck so I unplugged it, thought maybe it over heated, waited an hour and tried it again, it was done, couldn't move the button and wouldn't come on."
1,A noisy loser,"Bought this product April 13. It stopped working June 13. At the High setting, the dryer makes a horrible noise. After about 6 weeks of use, the dryer began to overheat and cut off when at the high setting. Finally, it overheated and would not turn back on for two days. If the manufacturer does not want me to use the high setting, why put it on the hair dryer?For years, the only type of hair dryer that leaves my hair frizz free is this type of brush dryer. This type has become very hard to find. I never tried this brand before. I will not waste my money on it again."
4,Andis 80345 Styler Hair Dryer,I just recieved this blowdryer today. I immediately tried it out and so far so good I am very pleased with this item. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 it's because it's lacking a swirvel cord and I do like to spin around alot just to make sure my hair comes out straight but other then that this product is a keeper.
2,Disappointed!,"No dryer that I have ever owned got my hair as shiny, bouncy, and straight as this dryer. I thought I had found a winner. However, the second time I used it, it made a popping sound and sparked inside the dryer part itself. The dryer still would turn on and not wanting to let go of such a good dryer, I gave it some time before trying again. It worked for awhile but then popped again and sparked. This time I had to give it up. I am too hurt. This dryer worked wonders on my hair but is a safety issue. Anyone know of any dryers with as good results as this one but better electrical makeup?"
1,Faulty electric,"I bought this item and within the first couple times I used it, it made a crackling noise and then shut off. After a few minutes it started again, I was able to finish my hair. That scared me, so I only used the High setting for short periods of time. A couple weeks later, I was drying my hair, it made the crackling noise and started throwing sparks. Not worth the money in my book."
4,"works great, best results i've ever had from a blow dryer","this product is awesome. it works great on my hair. i have really thick hair, and other blowdryers that i've used never blow dried my hair straight. my hair would still be thick and hard to manage. the andis dryer leaves my hair silky and manageable. the reason i gave it a 4 out of 5 is because when you set the dryer on high, it is really loud and also when i attach the fine tooth comb to the dryer, it's hard to slide it back out. however i don't use the fine tooth comb much, i use the wide tooth comb or else i would have a serious problem with the product."
1,Terrible!,"Two words: noisy and dangerous!It is not necessary to explain noisy...Dangerous because the inner part is definitely not well protected.Besides that, it takes too long to dry a hair that should had being completely dried in 5 minutes.I send my back."
5,Andis Dryer,Great dryer!! I just love the soft brush that you can run through your hair while drying. Might even buy another one!!!
1,Definitely Wouldn't Recommend,"I bought this dryer on 5-17-12 and it stopped working on 5-30-12. Only used it twice. It overheats way to quick when using the high setting. The dryer started smoking and then starks start flying everywhere. Not to mention it blew out my bathroom plug. I definitely don't plan on buying this brand again, definitely not worth it."
4,Best Hair Dryer - It did the trick!,"This dryer has a lot of power. It blew my hair extremely straight! I like the older model, but this newer version is just as good. This product is lighter and easier to handle. My only issue is - the shipping was slow."
4,Not as fancy as it works!!,"This thing is amazing...doesn't look at all fancy but does the job superbly! I have thick 4a hair and when I use this dryer, it's as if I'm using a flat iron. The results are straight, smooth light hair with a nice glow. I will def recommend. I give it 4 stars because the teeth broke on one if the comb and I have to buy the replacement comp, luckily they have them."
1,Switch Failure and Sparks,"I bought two of these dryers. The first popped, sparked and flashed out of the box. The second developed the same problem within a week. Frankly, they are dangerous. Steer clear."
1,Don't Buy-- Product should be recalled.,"When I first purchased this product in March of 2009 I loved it. Less than 90 days later the item made a popping sound and now only works on the high setting. There are several similar comments about this product only working for a short period of time, or the product starting to spark. Buyer beware. This item is probably not safe."
1,Poor Quality Control,The switch on the dryer failed within a week. I had to take it in for warranty service and it took almost two weeks to get another one. I haven't been able to pick it up yet but I hope it lasts longer than the first one.
1,It was a good idea to have a back-up dryer...,"Unfortunately, I didn't have the same experience as the prior reviewer(s). About 5 minutes after use, a loud popping noise came from near the outlet and the dryer shut off. I was too apprehensive to make another attempt w/ this product, so instead I returned it."
1,Sadly Disappointed,"I upgraded from a Gold N Hot 1200 for this one as was so excited to try it. Unfortunately, like the rest of the 1 star reviews, the dryer frequently overheats and then POP! it stops working."
4,"Great performance, great price","Works great and fast too! Design is easy to handle and manages my medium length hair without tangling, hair damp to dry in less than 20 mins. Great value."
2,Not my cup of tea,"Anne Tyler spends way too much time telling about the tiniest details. This slows the story down so much, the reader loses the way. I liked the characters, but lost interest among the details."
2,Disappointing,"I really like Anne Tyler's work, but this one was a disappointment. I know she deals in real people living real lives, but Justine and Duncan are not remotely sympathetic characters. The outcome with Caleb was a let-down. Overall, an empty story about mostly empty people."
2,Weak women -- an Anne Tyler speciality,"This is only the second Anne Tyler book I've read and I'm not impressed. The book was depressing. I had hope as the book progressed that the main character would ""triumph"" over her circumstances but instead she subsumed her own dreams for her husband's wants and needs. Anne Tyler implies that this is a noble sacrifice but I thought it was weak. She should have left her loser husband!"
4,Very enjoyable book -- not Herman Wouk's usual style,"""Aurora Dawn"" was Herman Wouk's first book, and while it is an enjoyable read, it is not comparable to his masterpieces like ""The Caine Mutiny"" or ""Marjorie Morningstar."" This tale of a young man in advertising who is determined to rise to the top at all costs is told in a flippant, almost sarcastic style. The author keeps intruding himself into the tale with comments on how the story is going, which can be annoying even though it yields some of the book's most humorous lines. The characters are deftly drawn but not especially sympathetic. This book is a quick and enjoyable read, and has some interesting takes on the advertising business. Just don't expect one of Wouk's masterpieces."
4,Aurora Dawn-Herman Wouk's first novel,"I have read all 13 of Herman Wouk's novels. It is his first novel written mostly while a naval reserve officer serving on a destroyer minesweper in the Pacific during WW2. I enjoyed all 13 of Wouk's novels. Aurora Dawn is amust read but is not i the class of his best work! Hence, the 4 stars!"
3,Auroroa Dawn,"It takes a while to get used to the author's style or writting which is different from any of his other books. Once you get comfortable with it, the writing gets interesting. This is one of his early works where it seems he is trying to act like an author instead of just telling a story."
2,Wouk just did not click with me,I just could not get into this book. Perhaps I did not give it enough of a chance (about 15%)but it just was not working.
2,No comparison,"I like to stay loyal to an author when I've enjoyed reading one of their books and after Marjorie Morningstar, I picked up Aurora Dawn. There is no comparison. If you are at all like me and like to immerse yourself into a good book, don't pick this one up. Wouk's writing style in this is strange, he makes constant asides from the author to the reader. It interrupts the story and makes it impossible to connect with either the plot or the characters."
3,6-alarm watch,"alarms work well BUT: can't read dial unless viewed at 90 and leather band buckle is already useless, must replace band after a month's use."
4,E pill watch,"The watch is easy to set, however, the alarm is not loud enough. The vibrate mode works but is not strong or long enough to wake me during the wee hours of the morning. It is great for during the day as I'm not a clock watcher."
1,did nothing it was supposed to do,"We did our best to make the watch do what it was supposed to do, but all we could get it to do was to tell the time."
3,Great Format--Limited Word Lists,"I was hoping to find more word lists to supplement /r/ therapy. Unfortunately, the book disappointed. Although I can find words for each of the vocalic /r/s, there are just not enough word lists or activities to use. I bought two other books from Linguisystems that provide many more resources and are much more engaging."
4,A Rare Homerun for Littell,"After reading Littell's epic ""The Company"", I found his subsequent books seriously lacking in one respect or another. But ""Legends"" puts him back at the top, as far as I'm concerned. This story, creative yet complex as it is, holds together. Littell doesn't go off on binges of poetry or history (at least not much) as he does in his other books. In this book, Littell makes the reader earn his pleasure, trying to keep the various ""legends"" straight and figuring out just what is going on at any given moment. Littell's characterizations are sharp and fascinating; his geography is spellbinding and tastes real; his descriptions of the machinations inside the CIA seem authentic. All in all, I think this was a good book and a worthy read. Once again, I can say I am looking forward to more Littell books."
2,The first 100 pages...,"reminded me of how disappointed in Robert Littell books. This isn't the first one of his I've read - the fact that I can't remember the title should say how much of an impact it made on me. This one started off great, but seemed to get bogged down in flashbacks that (as far as I got) was only just barely associated with the overall story. I liked the twist on the detective's character flaws, but it got old quick and the plot seemed to wander. After a couple of hundred pages, I didn't care what happened, so that means that this book joins its unnamed brother in the carboard box in my basement marked ""Goodwill."""
4,Very Good!!,"Martin Odum is a private detective in Brooklyn who previously had been a CIA field agent. At different times he had different identities or as might be called different Legends. Did he suffer from a multiple personality disorder? Who were the characters Dante Pippen, Lincoln Dittmann and Jozef Kafkor? The reader is taken on journies that include meeting Osama Bin Laden in South America, a terrorist training camp in the Bekka Valley, an adventure in Beirut, encounters with Chechen's. And, of course, his complex relationship with his former CIA handler Crystal Quest,now Deputy Director of Operations who masterminded the demise of the Soviet Union. This book contains many exciting twists,turns and plots. Definitely a top notch read that will keep your attention."
3,Overall Disappointing,"I loved Littell's The Company, which stands among the best two or three spy novels written. Legends is one of Littell's shorter, less intricate and engrossing pieces. Littell takes the reader on a romp through a seedy post-Cold War underworld, and his descriptions of locations and contexts are vivid. An example is a bizarre island in the Aral Sea where Soviet-era chemical and biological agents are stored. However, the love story plotline is poorly executed and a distraction, the backdrop of CIA/FBI handlers is thin, and the plotline of multiple ""legends"" (personalities) felt gimmicky. Littell compiled some excellent scenes, but didn't quite succeed in weaving them together into a plot of equal measure. Regardless, this is enjoyable reading if you have a few hours to kill over a long weekend or two."
5,Stunning,"I have read pretty much every spy novel ever written. This one needs just a few words - it is one of the masterpieces of the genre, right up there with A Coffin for Demetrios, Dark Star, early Le Carre and a few others. In fact, I found the work so brilliant that I wrote Mr. Littell a letter about it, and got a personal reply! Pretty unexpected in this day of corporate writing and boilerplate fiction. Bravo, Mr. Littell. May you live long and write often."
1,Not good!,Very Very disappointed with them. I recived it and it was not compabitable with APEX TV and Aspire Digital DVD player. So I called the Maxi company to ask for comfirmation number to return it back. No answer and left a message. Few days later nothing. So I called again ..again nothing. So I called Amazon and they took care of it for me. Thumbs up to Amazon. Thumbs down to Maxi. I would be very carefull of buying this product.
3,Coulda been a contender,"I loved this book, but I share Mark Forrester's distress about the absolutely abysmal editing. The reference to Leon Gross as ""Archibald Cox"" is just laughable. There's also a name misspelled in the acknowledgements; something I've never run across before. This in a book published by Harvard University Press, for God's sake.I nevertheless recommend the book with only the one caveat, albeit a rather large one -- don't quote anything you find here as fact without checking it out yourself. It could be something the fact checkers missed..."
3,Fun,"Every St. Patrick's Day is party time at our house and this certainly helps to promote the ""wearin' o' the green"" atmosphere. It only takes a while for friends and family to join in the singing and before you know it they're jigging too... great fun!"
4,Check out da grill,"It was what I was lookin for and it was at a great price and easy installation. the only issue i had is it did appear to have some type of mildew or stain that is hard to remove on 2 of the vertical bars. Ive used purple power and stain remover and still havent gotten it all off, but it is hard to notice now and at that price I cant really complain. It does bring out my truck too. overall happy with it"
5,Crazy-Ass Book!,"Great read, I've re-visited this a couple of times. His other stuff like Deadville also very good. Just a wild, imaginative ride."
1,"Conspiracy theory type stuff. Easy to read, though","I downloaded the pamphlet off the Net for free and read through the author's ideas. Dr. Ben's style is tongue in cheek, easy enough to read, and he makes some interesting points.Still, I see why it's popular in the fiction/conspiracy/afro American themed sites. Apparently, the Masons had a big hand in writing the Bible and ensuring that we only saw their versions. Funny stuff.If you come across this pamphlet, give it a read. Just do some research and you'll see that many of the author's points may need clarification and follow-up. Take it for what it is...."
1,Not worth the bother,"As a serious student of history and Bible study, I thought that the title made this pamphlet seem like it might present a new and challenging perspective. Something to provoke thought. Well, I could not have been more wrong. Even at 24 pages it is almost all padding. At best out of an entire paragraph, one sentence might contain some real content. But that is true only half the time. Most of what little information is given is not new or controvertial. It is for the most part available in any good bible/history study. The only part that is even remotely new or interesting, is that it is written entirely from a Afro-centric point of view. And if you are black, none of that is new, either. In short both a waste of time and money. Even if free, it might not be worth the two minutes of your life it would take to read it."
5,Informative easy read,i received this book sooner than i thought & in excellent condition. the information contained therein is in a simple to read & refer back to format.
2,A waste of time,"I am surprised by the glowing reviews posted because I found the book shallow, incomplete and devoid of any useful detail. Of course the price is very low, but paying anything for something that has no value is no bargain.It was probably worth the $4 I paid for it, but that may be debatable."
3,Clever comparisons but not worth buying,It was a very simplistic book for me and have passed it on at the laundromat. Someone else is enjoying perhaps.
4,Classic,"This soundtrack truely captures the essence of hard rock during the early 80's. It is still great today. The hidden gem just might be the only song by a woman on the soundtrack, Stevie Nicks. Her song ""Blue Lamp"" is awesome and is my personal favorite. Very good rock song and the rest of the soundtrack is great also. Goes really good with the movie."
4,Very good soundtrack for a lousy film,"Perhaps i should bother with reviewing the film itself, i'll just say it here: the movie is awful, whereas its soundtrack rocks."
3,heavy metal,"got this for my husband for an anniversary present and he loved it. I actually have seen it and it's not my cup of tea,but it's a pretty cool movie and the music is good."
2,Beware...this ST doesn't include any of Elmer Bernstein's magnificent symphonic score!,"I've been looking for another recording of Elmer Bernstein's grand music called the ""symphonic score"" from HEAVY METAL that I once had on vinyl but lost in a house-fire. Does anyone know where I could find it perhaps on compact disc?"
2,A strange selection of non-heavy-metal songs,"There are only four good songs on this album:Heavy Metal by Sammy HagarHeavy Metal by Don FelderRadar Rider by RiggsOkay, three songs. I was going to add Blue Oyster Cult's 'Veteran of the Psychic Wars' or Black Sabbath's 'The Mob Rules,' but they just aren't in the same class as the three listed above.And the rest of it? Well, Cheap Trick is always entertaining but never amazing. The songs by lesser-known bands are okay. Journey's 'Open Arms' is completely out of place. So is Stevie Nicks.You have to admire the wide range of songs here, but the top three outshine the rest. (And there's something funny about the fact that the two best songs on the Heavy Metal soundtrack are BOTH called Heavy Metal. Maybe the producers should have given each band or musician that requirement: ""The song has to be called Heavy Metal."")"
5,Great movie. Even better soundtrack.,"Original motion picture soundtracks don't get any better than this, folks. You won't here ME complaining. There are so many great things to be said about this collection. This is classic rock/metal at it's best. Don Felder's 2 songs are better than anything that the Eagles have ever done. Also you'll find one of the best (albeit lesser known) BOC songs - Verteran of the Psychic Wars. And fellow Black Sabbath fans will be interested to know that Tony Iommi does a completely different lead solo on this version of 'Mob Rules.' Believe me, I was surprised, too! Speaking of different versions of songs, Sammy Hagar's 'Heavy Metal' is much stronger, here, than on his own album. And if you haven't heard the song 'Crazy' by Nazareth, then you really are missing out. I'm not a huge Nazareth fan, but this song rocks! But I've said enough. -- Scott S. <sghost1@cool.com>"
4,Heavy Metal Review,"In retrospect the album is much better than the movie. I saw the movie many years ago and recently rented it again. To say the least, I was disapointed. My memory serves me wrong. The movie really wasn't as good as I remembered but the album certainly is. This is a killer album that still stands the test of time. The variety of styles is very good with some truly original scores. Sammy is still the king but has a great supporting cast. I continue to listen to this soundtrack and still have not tired of it."
5,I thought it was a Great Soundtrack and it Still Is,"It has fantastic music from all sorts of great bands. The bands include Sammy Hagar, Blue Oyster Cult, Cheap Trick, Stevie Nicks, Black Sabbath, Nazareth, Journey and more."
5,Timeless classic,"Although it's questionable to show this movie to children, my father showed this older-than-we-are classic to my siblings and I in the 80s; boy am I glad he did! This soundtrack took me back to my younger days and prompted me to pop the DVD in and take a trip down memory lane... do yourself a favor and purchase!"
5,5 stars to the London Symphony Orchestra!!,The music score of the movie is excellent! Why hasn't there been the release of the music score of this film?
4,Can't go wrong,"Classic soundtrack for a classic animated film. I always wanted to have this CD, and finally decided to drop a few bucks for it."
4,Heavy Platinum on the Soundtrack,"The soundtrack to the 1981 animated film is an excellent example of the merging of two pop culture genres that was prevalent during this era. And the wide range of musical styles is an outstanding cross-section of this ""Golden Era"" for FM rock-orientated radio.There are arena tour mainstays like Black Sabbath (The Mob Rules), Blue Oyster Cult (Veteran of the Psychic Wars), Grand Funk Railroad (Queen Bee), Journey (Open Arms) and Nazareth (Crazy {A Suitable Case for Treatment}), along with members of super groups (Donald Fagen, Don Felder, Stevie Nicks) showing some style on their own.Cheap Trick (Reach Out, I Must Be Dreamin') is at the height of its radio playlist power, while Riggs, Trust and the quirky Devo add some spice to the mix. Sammy Hagar provides a solid punch with the title track.The heavy metal on here is platinum, as the performances are as good as it gets from these artists."
4,Samsung HDTV LCD,This is a fine product. Be careful doing returns with Amazon. I have waited since Dec. 20th for credit on the second television sent in their error. They still as of 02/05/2008 have not given me credit.BEWAREVicki Lea Fey
4,Plasma Vs Lcd,I find it good the LCD picture display. But thedvd Play back is much better on Plasma. color combination is lot more richer than LCD with the exception of reflections during day time
5,GREAT TV GREAT SERVICE,I AM VERY STATISFIED BY THIS TV. IT LOOKS GOOD IN MY LIVING ROOM EVEN WHEN IT IS NOT TURNED ON!
2,Don't buy it,"Pros - Good picture qualityCons - Clicking noise for 30 secs when turning on or off the unit (relays) or when the pic dims and sound quality is just ok, but when you connect to your stereo it has an echo. I muted the TV to just use the stereo and the mute icon stayed on the screen the whole time."
5,"Samsung LNT 4661F 46"" 1080p LCD HDTV","This is What a TV is supposed to be. The picture is beyond expectation, especially when watchin Star Wars 1 in Blue Ray: WOW, it is as good as a movie in the theater, but with the creature comforts of home."
4,Great TV for the price,"Just bought thios TV and it is great. Picture is very bright and clear with no problems of blurring. Price dropped 280.00 since I bought it but Amazon refunded me the money, no hassles. The reason I did not give this 5stars is because I have a Sony XBR TV to compare this to. The Sonys picture is definately better but only by a small margin. The price of the Sony is also double the price so the Samsung is a good deal. Only took 4 days from ordering to receiving TV. Great customer service and will continue to shop at Amazon."
5,Excellent TV,I followed the band wagon on this on cause pretty much everyone I know has this TV. Did not dissapoint.
5,LCD TV,TV ARRIVED AS SCHEDULED. SET UP INSTRUCTIONS WERE EASY TO FOLLOW. BEAUTIFUL PICTURE. GOOD INSTRUCTION BOOK.
5,Still happy after three months of use.,"Maybe you're not like me. Maybe you don't hook up a laptop to your big-screen TV. Let's say, though, that you do. What would you expect? Perfect picture resolution? Near HD quality from XViD and DiVX encoded videos? If you said ""yes""... you're absolutely correct.This is a wonderful TV. Inputs for all sorts of video, a USB link, a very useful remote, the list has been enumerated already. I love it, and it impresses everyone who comes by and sees it. And for under 2k shipped to my door, and unpacked in my house? Unbeatable.-C"
5,"Samsung LNT4661F 46""","We are pleased with the purchase of this HDTV for our ""Man Cave"". Great price for a wonderful HDTV!!! It is perfect for our room to watch action videos, sports, etc. We would definitley recomend this to a friend.Our only complaint is that the picture can get skewed if you are sitting in a certain area. This is defined in consumer reports and is normal for this type of HDTV. We were aware of this when we purchased the item"
4,"HDTV picture very good, SD fuzzy","HDTV picture is outstanding for most situations, blurs a little with high action scenes. SD picture is fuzzy but this appears to be the case for all HDTVs and is also depedent upon the signal source."
5,Great TV,We really like the tv. Great images. They came and set it up and made sure it was working before taking off.
2,"Initially great, now very disappointed","TV was great, while it lasted. Out of the box, looked great, picture & sound were very good, and so excited about purcahse. Bought it October of 2007. November 2011, tv started getting darker, and no adjustment to contract/brightness would bring it back. one side of screen looked great, but 1/2 was so dark you could barely see.Not buying a samsumg again....."
3,Great TV - POOR SHIPPING,"I can't say anything that hasn't already been said about the TV - it is fantastic. However, I was very disappointed with the shipping. I was given a five day window and was not contacted when the delivery was being made. I got to my building one day to see a large box sitting in the mail area (just off the lobby and not secure at all). It was in an area where it would have been easy for someone to take it and I would never have known because I wasn't told that it was there. Not what I expected after spending over $2000. Once I got it up to my unit I noticed that the box was damaged and that it had been resealed. Luckily it was okay but I would not have had the means to refuse the package if something had been wrong. I consider myself lucky that everything worked out this time but I will not order any other big ticket items from Amazon because I can't be sure of the shipping quality."
5,Good deal - I would do it again,I was hesitant to make such a large purchase on the internet but everything worked out nicely. I'd recommend it to anyone. Can't beat the price!!
5,Samsung LNT4661,"This LCD TV was purchased through me for my son. It was delivered to me, since my son was working, and it arrived on time and in perfect condition. He loves his Samsung because of the looks of the TV, and performance. He has a ""Blue Ray"" disk player connected to it and tells me that Blue Ray HD movies make you think that you are on the movie set, due to the sharpness of the screen.Samsung LNT4661F 46"" 1080p LCD HDTV"
1,"Screen developed defect after 2 years of use, $1100 repair needed","This TV was great while it lasted. But after about 2 years, the screen developed a shadowy defect on the right side of the panel. Looked like a swoosh running from the top of the screen to the bottom, not uniform. Turns out the screen panel was defective. Being out of warranty, the expected cost to fix was over $1100. I'm very disappointed that this TV only lasted 2 years. With the rate new televisions are developed and released to market, it's impossible to know if what you're getting is going to be quality. I just figured I should share my experience in case it helps someone avoid a purchasing mistake down the road."
5,Great TV,"I had this tv for nearly 3 months and am very satisfied with my purchase. In the beginning the brightness of the tv is a bit overwhelming in a dark room but after a few hours it will adjust to normal. 720p and 1080p video is exceptional and will measure up against any tv in the 10:000 to 1 contrast arena. The only knock I have against this tv is that in dark scenes, it is hard to see the picture clearly. It's a disappointment but this may be common in many LCD tvs. Other than that great tv and great deal from Amazon."
2,lnt466af-,"wow did I have high hopes for this set. I did my research and decided to go for the brand new Samsung LNT-4661F. I compared it to the Sony, Sharp Aquos, and Runco Crystal (too expensive). Well I went with for the Samsung- it has the nicest look and feature set (per dollar) of any of the sets. After spending all weekend wiring my attic and wall mounting the set, I finally power on the set- and WOW what a POS! The image processor couldn't keep up with any motion. I tried HDMI, component and over the air and all produced a red 'dotting' on white areas of motion. Now I have packet it back up and am going to exchange it for another. I hope the next one has the bugs worked out. Samsung, nice job testing your sets before shipping them out."
2,Samsung remote control sucks,"I bought the TV during thanksgiving sale. The TV looks and feels all right. One of the major disappointments is the remote control. I had a few AV device at home, a sony VCR, panasonic DVD player, dishnetwork receiver box. The remote control is claimed able to work with all the device if you follow the instructions in the mannual. However when I actually try it, it does not work with any of them. Finally, I called Samsung customer service, the answer from them is that I am out of luck if it does not work.It is just plain ridiculous. If samsung could not get a $10 remote control to work, they should at least OEM it to people manufacturing universal remote controls. For God's sake, what is the price that the TV is selling at."
5,This Will Be An Amazing TV!!!,"Holy cow! I just ordered this TV about a half hour ago and I already love it!I can just imagine how great the picture quality will be! And the sound? Wow, I've never imagined such great sounding sound! It will sound so crisp and clear!Can't wait for this to arrive because it's awesome! I had a bunch of friends over and they were blown away by me clicking the order button! If just ordering the TV filled me with this much bliss, using it will probably kill me!So order this, you won't be dissapointed by the ordering of it!EDIT:And I was right, the TV is faaaantastic! I've been doing nothing but gaming on it since I set it up and the picture quality is amazing. At first the video seemed a little blurry/laggy, but either it warmed up or I adjusted to it.Either way, I'm very happy with my purchase (and the purchasing of it). So if you're looking for a TV this size, you won't be unhappinated by it!"
5,Great TV at a good price,"The TV is in a very sunny room and it's great because there is no glare. The picture quality is quite good and it's fairly easy to operate. The price, with shipping included, enticed 3 friends to also buy the TV from Amazon."
1,Don't buy this TV,"Had the 15 month issue that others are complaining about. Samsung did nothing, not even a coupon for repair or purchase of another. $1700 down the drain. That works out to $100 per month of use before it goes bad. You can go to Ren-A-Center for less and get it replaced if it goes bad. No more Shamsung! Sony Bravia, yes."
1,Great TV...for the first year,"Had I reviewed this TV within the first year, I would've given it 5 stars. But 21 months after I purchased it, I've started having problems with the picture. When I turn it on, the screen is divided into 4 horizontal segments, with ghost shapes appearing below the images. At first, maybe about a month ago, it would ""warm up"" in a few minutes and the picture would become normal. It's gradually taken longer for this to happen... now, it's about 25 minutes or so. And then this week, a new development: After being on for an hour and adjusting to a normal picture, it then reverted to the horizontal lines/ghost shapes. Since I often only have time to watch TV for 30 or 45 minutes at a time, this has been especially maddening. I would've been better off keeping my older Toshiba, which is still working great for the friend I gave it to."
1,worthless brand,"I purchased a Samsung Lcd Tv in June 2008. It looked great ,the picture quality was great. However a week before Christmas it would not power up . No picture no sound . I called Samsung and they said take it in for service. The diagnosis was bad lcd screen , probably bad circuit board. The cost of repair is more than the cost of a new tv. I paid 699.00 for this set and now it is worthless. There are so many complaints on the same issue with Samsung tvs . I wish there was some remedy for this but the only recourse is to spread the word dont buy Samsung..They will not stand behind their product after one year!"
1,Do NOT buy this TV!!,"This TV started giving us trouble a few months out of warranty. We tried to get it fixed with no luck. It shows 4 horizontal lines on the screen and ghosting of images on the right side. After 30 minutes it warms up and reverts to normal. And I find multiple accounts of this exact problem listed on the web. (in addition to others) What a waste of money, this cost too much month to be trouble free for not even two years. I personally am rethinking Samsungs in general."
1,Do NOT Buy this TV,I bought this TV two years ago for $1500 and it is already having problems. Samsung's response is that it is out of warranty and I am looking at repairs of over $500. I will not be purchasing a Samsung product again.
1,problem without solution,"I bought this set in June 2007. The first day when it was out of the 1-year warranty, the problem occurred -- TV with sound but no picture. Later on I figuured that this is a problem that will show up when it is humid but will go away if it is sunny. Fortunately I had the AmericanExpress. Howevever the repair shops can't really fix it because it is highly intermitent and goes away when the rain stops. I have been struggle with it and talk to different repair shops and American Express. But there seems to be no solution to this problem. I googled and found that this is a common problem to many users and no one had a successful fix. Now I am out of the American Express extended warranty as well. Stay away from this product."
5,"Outstanding! No bands, No Clouds... Just 1080P Glory","This set replaces a cloudy Sony 46V2500 I had and it is outstanding. I ordered directly from Vanns and it was delivered in under a week. If you are in the market for a new TV, this is a great choice. I have no regrets for swapping my Sony for this set."
4,Good Samsung HDTV,"The picture looks great. The sound is great. When we got it it made a ""clicking noise"" when we turned it on and off. So we called Samsung and they sent someone out to look at it. They said it was a bad ""relay switch."" Amazon picked up the old tv and dropped off the new tv at the same time within a week. Great service from Amazon along the whole way!!! However, the new tv does the same thing just not as bad. I don't know if it's just part of the tv or what but it only does it for a few seconds when we turn it on and off so it's not that big of a deal. Definitely recommend Amazon and TV is great but not perfect so only 4 out of 5 stars..."
5,Great LCD TV at a Great Price,"Went shopping online the day after Christmas after researching whether or not to get a Plasma or an LCD TV, 720p vs 1080p. Decided LCD was the best technology for me. Picture is great. Easy to setup and hook up to surround sound, xBox 360, Wii, etc. We love it!!! Price at Amazon was great and shipped in 5 days."
1,Lasted 2 years and 10 months...,Great TV (for 2 years and 10 months...). I purchased this TV from Amazon in December of 2007. I now see a black rectangle that appears on my screen and distorts the image. After following the repair process via Samsung's website I learned that it would cost me $1350 (to repair a TV that I paid $1500 for). Very frustrating!
1,Samsung capacitor problem,"Have had this tv for 2 years, and it worked well until about 2 months ago. Now it takes forever to turn on and if you read the blogs, Samsung has a problem with capacitors and the TVs not turning on, and eventually failing. I would recommend either a maintenance contract or another brand"
1,Shame on Samsung...$1700 and the TV heads for the trash!!!,"Like so many others, I bought this TV after plenty of research on 46"" LCDs. Loved the TV for about 20 months and then lost an 8"" wide vertical section on the left side of the screen. Can't get a response out of Samsung as the warranty was only one-year. Total joke...it was a great deal for about $1700 on Amazon when I bought it, but now it is a useless piece of electronic junk that I can't even use in my basement. Shame on Samsung and I will do whatever I can to never buy their products and tell others to do the same. The real Bummer....Now I have to move my 10 year old 36"" Sony back into the family, but at least it keeps working."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV,"I purchased this TV 18 months ago thru Amazon, it is now broken (picture failed) and out of warranty. This TV got rave reviews from many sites in the beginning but if you do your research you will find hundreds of complaints that this TV fails about 1 year to 18 months in - which is naturally outside of warranty and Samsung refuses to acknowledge the problem! Unless you always pruchase an extended warranty with Samsung I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN as I just threw away $1700.00!!!"
3,Underwhelmed,"We got this TV based on recommendations and good reviews as well as my wife seeing one in the store and thinking that it had a great picture. Although the colors are vivid and still shots beautiful, there is a blurriness when there is motion that drives me crazy. I even connected my old 32"", 10 year CRT up to the s-video of my HD cable box and the Samsung up to the HDMI of the same box to be sure they were getting the same HD feed (even though the CRT couldn't reproduce it as HD is was on the same channel). I then watched an HD hockey game. When players, particularly background players, moved it was difficult to even read the numbers on their jersey on the Samsung, but I could read them easily with my old CRT. I have a DVR so I was able to rewind and compare the same plays repeatedly to verify the difference and it was noticeable. Very disappointing."
2,Good for 3 years and then $$$$,"I bought this TV because of the good reviews. I expected it to perform on a par with other TVs I've owned, particularly in view of the price I paid for it. This was not to be. The backlight failed at 3 1/2 years which, to my mind, should not happen with an $1800 TV. Needless to say, this is my last Samsung."
2,Samsung LNT4661F LCD TV,"The Amazon ""white glove"" delivery was great! The TV worked great for two years then started to fail with the purple dot syndrome many of this model gets. I would hesitate to purchase another Samsung as other reviews from other sources indicate they are not standing by this product since it is ""out of warranty"" These are expensive TV's and I expect something of this magnitude to last a lot lot longer. The picture quality is good once the set is turned off then on again to remove the purple dots. If you are a do it yourself-er, it can be fixed by replacing several capacitors for less than $50.00. Otherwise it could cost up to $200.00. Kind of big to bring into the repair shop."
4,Samsung 4661F,"Awesome Picture. I read a lot a reviews and heard a lot about the glare. I have this TV in a room with 7 windows. I have no problems with glare at all. Easy Setup, needs some tweaking to get the best picture. Overall, I would definately buy this TV again."
1,Sound. No picture,2 years after I purchased this set it broke. I have a black screen and no sound. search google and you'll find this is a common problem. I made a $2000 mistake. Avoid this tv
1,Failed after 16 months. Don't buy!,"We bought this Samsung LCD Television (mode LN-T4661F) on February 15, 2008 from Amazon.com for $1,624.99. Starting in June of 2009 our television has been displaying strange patterns when we turn it on, or part of the screen won't display at all. We called the warranty telephone number and they wouldn't help me because it's past the 1-year warranty. I've emailed customer support, but they won't return my emails.I think it's absolutely unacceptable that a $1,600 television would fail after 16 months. We bought Samsung because we thought it was a good television brand.DON'T BUY THIS TELEVISION!!"
1,"72 hours from clicking ""buy now"" to install complete!","Loved it for 18 months, then the black shadows started showing up.You'll get flickering and horizontal lines that disappear after some warm-up.But, the warm-up time keeps getting longer and longer.Paid $99 to find out that it will cost $1100 to replace the panel.You probably can't find this model anymore, but avoid if you do!"
2,Excellent TV when it worked,"It worked great for 3 years and now when I switch on the TV, it takes a while to boot, then I see the purple and green spots. I have to turn it off and turn it on again, it will come back after a long pause without the dots. Very disappointed with the quality. Spent $2500 when it came out and its not worth it. I am going to call Samsung to see if they will help me fix it."
5,"Super TV, Super service from Amazon, once again","I usually do not submit reviews, but we LOVE this TV and the service from Amazon. I ordered it on Monday, and even though the shipping date estimation was several days later, we received it on Thursday! Incredible! But, you must be flexible to be able to arrange home delivery with this delivery company. Luckily, I was able to work from home that afternoon. Anyway, great TV, great service. Highly recommend."
4,MAD about Madlands!,"Tales of the City meets Moo U. Delightful characters of every stripe send up political correctness in the Capital of PC -- Madison, WI! Too much fun to be missed. And just wait till you read the sequel -- God's Little Isthmus."
4,Overall very fun game,"I find this game to be very fun to play. You use the DK bongo accessories to play from a selection popular and classic songs. Some of these songs have been modified a bit to make them easier to drum to. None of the songs with lyrics are done by the original artists. This is actually an improvement, in my opinion, for some of them like ""Rock Lobster"" by the B52s. There are three difficulty levels, which start out at the relatively easy ""monkey"" and progressively get more difficult with ""chimp"" and finally ""gorilla"", which is incredibly challenging."
4,Good game for kids ages 6 and up!,"Although this game hurts your hands from hitting the bongos and clapping a lot, it's all worth it! You can play some of your favorite songs on this game and you'll go bananas for some of them! I really like this game because up to 4 players can play, even without the bongos. This game will get you off your feet and get you into the groove!"
4,"fun, but needs better selection of songs","I love the gae, because it doesn't have the pressure of trying to ""beat the game"" there is no ""boss"" at the end, infact there is no ""end"" to the game. I wish there was a better selection of songs, Tested and approved as a fun game for parties, with or without extra bongos."
4,fun,I think this game is fun but i thimk there should be music specified for each genre' like a hiphop konga a rock konga a dance kona a pop konga and a kiddie konga and so on then it would get a perfect rateing
3,Konjo Jungle,This game is ok if your into games like DDR but youll find that DDR will be more entertaining since theres more buttons or step panels for you to press unlike donkey konga with only 2 you can hit both for a third buttong but its not really a diffrence.
3,Hmm....Why Nintendo Why..,"Apparently Nintendo doesnt like money..why would you realease this garbage..where is the sequel to the beloved donkey kong 64? o well, maybe this is one of the reasons why nintendo has the worst selling system..and has probably made more money off of gameboys"
1,looks good untill you play it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I went to gamestop and they have the demo of the game and when i was playing it i just go tired of the game it's the same thing happing all the the time!!!!!! Don't waste your money on this junk!!!!!!!!!!!!! note:(i'm an nintendo fan!!!!!!!)
5,Great voice.,I finally received this cd. The cut operator is incredible. And the dance song Can You Feel My Love is great. This woman can sing. And not only sing but feel the song. For a first CD this is good stuff. Easy and fine.
5,Brought the chef out of me!,Wei Chuan's collection of cookbooks are fabulous. All the recipes are as authentic as it gets. Recipes are easy to follow and it actually TASTES good. I am planning to get the whole collection of Wei Chuan's cookbooks.
2,Highly Disappointed!,"We love Chinese foods and spicy foods. I bought this book thinking I'm going to cook up some spicy and delicious meals. However, when the book arrived... I was highly disappointed to discover the recipes - did not appeal to me, not not as impressive as I expected it to be. Not enough recipes for meat... and more like a vegetarian cookbook! I found more delicious and practical recipes from the book ""Chinese Cuisine"" which I also bought along with this book."
1,not for vegetarians!,I had hoped that there would be a fair amount of vegetarian recipes in this book but was very disappointed to find precious few.
4,Wonderful Book!,"Aunt Dimity's Death is a wonderful book! My teacher, Miss O., had our class listen to an audiobook and write an online review. Well, I'm glad I picked this book because it was excellent! Lori, who is a main charactor, helps Aunt Dimity. At first, Lori thought that Aunt Dimity was a lady from childhood stories. Now she finds out that Dimity was a REAL person and Dimity is dead. The book is great. It is a little bit of romance and mystery mixed together. Lori also goes on all these adventures to help Dimity. You are going to have to find out how she helps her on your own! Read the book!!"
5,Aunt Dimity is gone....or is she?,"A stuffed bunny and a self-writing diary don't seem like the most likely helpers to solve a mystery, but Nancy Atherton uses both to great effect. Aunt Dimity is quite a lady, and her (living) helpers aren't bad either. I find myself caring about these people, and can't wait for the next installment."
3,Ok.......,"This book is a captivating read but it has a number of flaws.Firstly,the ghost of Aunt dimity returned and she actually communicated with Lori and Bill!!That part was hard to believe.Also,I found the character,Aunt Dimity,a little unbelievable.She seemed like a character from a fairytale,who created stories to brighten up people's lives.She was a too good to be true.However,I still give it 3 stars as i think it's still an awesome mystery,despite the flaws.It's definitely a great holiday read!"
3,A Little Bit of Everything for Cozy Lovers,"""Aunt Dimity's Death"" seems to have a little bit of everything for die-hard cozy mystery fans. There is certainly mystery (although no murder) which has to do with a mysterious inheritance. There is coziness--English countryside, dashing pilots, daffy old ladies, prim and proper British attorneys, and lots and lots of tea! There is romance (but certainly no overt sex). There is even a ghost (but if you don't like ghost stories, don't worry as this ghost doesn't intrude). Personally, I found the book charming and the characters clearly drawn and delightful. I was absolutely in tears by the end--and happy tears at that. Aunt Dimity was not who (or what) I expected her to be--she was ever so much more.Patricia RockwellAuthor--""Sounds of Murder"""
4,Wonderful Book - So glad I decided to read it!,"I love suspense mystery books. However, I picked this one up one day and read it in about 4 hours! I completed the last few chapters while drinking my favorite cup of tea - which is what each person reading this book should do! The book was very warm, enjoyable, hated to see it end!"
2,"A quick, yet unfulfilling, read......","Despite all the highly-rated reviews, I must agree with the Publisher's Weekly review above. I just couldn't get into this book. Even though the slight ""mystery"" aspect was there, it was a little too cookie-cutter for me. Nonetheless, I do realize we all have different tastes in books. For me, I need a little more suspense."
2,am I the only one......,"who found this book a bit boring? It took me the first 100 pages to finally get into it, then my interest piqued for about 30 more pages, and finally I was bored again. It is a cozy-ish little somewhat mystery book, but I'm not sure I would read the other Dimity books."
2,Too sweet,"I read this first title in the series thinking the ghost would be the crime-solver, and was disappointed to find she was not. The main character is Lori Shepherd, the first person to have dealings with the ghost of Dimity, and the book is largely from her perspective.The author has a very pleasant style, but this is primarily a romance, and I don't like romances. That I finished it is sort of a tribute to the author, but it was soooo sweet, so very very sweet, that I think it left a cavity in my left frontal lobe and I need a reverse lobotomy. I'll have to pass on others in the series."
5,Aunt Dimity's Death,I read aloud to a 98 year old lady. The flow of the words makes reading aloud easy. The suspense at the end of each chapter holds the readers attention.The story will appeal to an ageless group. The humor and characters are timeless.
2,Disapointed with Dimitys' Heir,"I thought the story would be a nice cozy read but I kept getting more and more annoyed with Lori Shepard. She started out as a relatively well drawn character until she meets the executors of Dimitys' will. She then begins whining and complaining when anyone shows her kindness and respect.Although Bill is obviously destined to become more involved with Lori, I never got the impression he wanted a true friendship with her.On the plus side; I really enjoyed Aunt Dimitys' machinations and wished she'd appeared sooner and stayed longer."
4,First book of the aunt dimity series recommended,"I liked the bit of ""paranormal"" in the book with the introduction to aunt Dimity.Book jumps every now and then topics, which had me feeling a bit lost, but overall a nice read."
3,not a mystery,"I was expecting murder - or at least mayhem - so I might have rated it a little higher if it hadn't been in the mystery section. I guess mystery doesn't have to mean murder mystery but it usually does.I did like it well enough to finish it and have gone on to read 3 more Aunt Dimity books, which I like much better now that I am in the groove (or, maybe they are better, not sure).I found this one well written, somewhat predictable, but still enjoyable. Sweet is ok, if you are in the right mood, and I'm thinking this would be the perfect book to read on a cold, rainy day with a pot of tea and a fireplace in front of you and all your pets around you.Helps if you are an Anglophile!"
2,"Theory, NOT Application","This is a book focus on the theory.It concentrate on how to derive equations,rather than how to solve problems.Therefore, it contains very few examples and no MATLAB code.Also, this book assumes that the readers are already familiar with z-Transform.If this is your first exposure to Z-transform, you will have difficulty from Chapter 1.Also, aware that every exercise problems have VERY LONG list of subproblems.Most problems easily have sub-problems from (a) (b) (c) ... to (k).Some of them goes to (a) (b) (c) ... to (p) !!It takes A LOT of time to solve one problem completely.If you make one mistake in the middle, you are screwed.I wouldn't recommend this book as a learning tool.Instead, I would suggest""Digital control of Dynamic System"" by Franklin or""Discrete Time Control System"" by Ogata.Both of them were far easier to read and focus on problem solving."
1,Sample image not actual mat size???,Why does the sample image not show the actual mat size? You can't possibly PARK a normal car on a mat that is 3' X 4'. Are there other sizes available that will actually fit underneath a normal sized vehicle?
1,:-(,"I was very disappointed in the workmanship and quality of this light set. The tiny bulbs gave off very little light, the light covers were too small and they (the light covers) would not stay on. Even though the covers were different colors, the size of the covers and light bulbs made most of them look the same color. I found a different set of patio lights at ...and they are exactly what I wanted, cost less too."
4,CAN SEE WHAT GENESIS SAW IN THIS TALENT,RAY WILSON'S BAND BEFORE HIS SHORT STINT IN GENESIS. THIS CD IS GRUNGE INFLUENCED BUT WILSON'S VOCAL TALENTS SHINE AND MAKE THIS A GOOD LISTEN. WILSON HAS A GREAT RANGE AND IT IS SAD THAT GENESIS COULD NOT CONTINUE WITH HIM. THE ONLY GRUNGY CD I OWN. EVEN I WEAR FLANNEL SOMETIMES. POWERFUL SONGS!
4,Good but not for all surface feeders,Product has a picture of a guppy on the front but too big for guppies to eat. I had to purchase the small fish formula for the guppies. My betta can still eat these so it won't go to waste. It's still a great product though.
3,average beginning algebra text,"I bought this book for a beginning algebra course. It was a useful book. I passed with an ""A""."
3,"Awesome shorts, with threads that run :(","These shorts are awesome as far as aesthetics, comfort, and moisture wicking performance go. They hold your legs snugly, don't ride up, and the chamois is excellent.Unfortunately, two pairs in a row have started to come undone at the seams on the left cheek. The first pair (black) was a few weeks after their first use, and the second pair (the gunmental/black)was immediately after their first use/wash (in the machine on delicates).The first pair of RS's I bought, the white/black pair, are still fine, in all respects. Not sure what's going on here. Sad to say though, as otherwise these shorts are really awesome."
3,Not true to size,These run very very small. Previous reviews suggested ordering 1/2 size bigger. I would suggest ordering 1 whole size bigger. My daughter wears a 9 to 91/2. I ordered size 10 and it is still too small.
3,Amplifies your own voice?!,"I bought this for my 96 year old hard-of-hearing grandmother. She has a hard time understanding how cordless phones work, but she did well with this one. The only problem was I had to turn it way down because it actually amplifies YOUR voice as you talk into it - even more than the incoming voice. There doesn't appear to be a separate way you can turn down the volume of your own voice vs. those of your callers. Now when she talks into the phone she speaks very low and it's hard to hear HER, but she doesn't want to hurt her own ears by talking loudly into it. Strange."
1,Obsolete Unit,"Though not named as such on the product page, the telephone is now obsolete. It is no longer manufactured by CLARITY. I would not have known this unless I had received a defective unit to which the vendor could not offer technical support. Subsequently, I called CLARITY in TN and found out the 435 Model is no longer made. Model 4105 was recommended by CLARITY. We'll see how THAT (current)model functions."
3,would i dare,"no i wouldn't overprice not the way i wanted it, i could have went to kmart and done itno"
4,Great lens,I love this lens.. it is a great all around lens but because of the fstops it is best for outside shooting. Clear pics and it focuses great.
4,Da Bomb,"this game ROCKS. Imagine Halo with the technology of samus. That's how good they made it but the @$%#ing save points are very frustrating. Perfect storyline, enhanced graphics. Want a game like Halo but don't have a XBOX, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU. dA BOBm!!!! (;P.S You extreme halo LOVERS they are making a Halo 3"
4,It's fine,"After playing most of the first metroid prime game, I didn't want to get wrapped up in another, but of coarse i did. This, just like all metroid games, will take a lot of time and thinking, but is extremely fun."
4,"amazing , but ..","the first Metroid was fun and didn't have a 1-4 player mode.The new one is amazingly fun but not the adventure mode.The 1-4 player mode is very fun, for the fact that you can get hacking to people, the light beam , the dark beam, the annililator beam,and the death ball which is a really cheap weapon.But you'll notice that the game is rated:T for violance and animated blood, If your mom or dad are caution freaks there is no blood at all, at all!But if your a good gamer,as to my friend this game is right right for you if you want a challeng for the adventure modde this game is right for you."
4,"Metroids, Look Out!","This game is hot and rolling. It has a good storyline, perfect graphics, and nice new looking weapons! The only two things that I have to say against it are:(1) The glich after the Echo Visor(2) The Scan Visor is too colorful these days!Another thing is that the difficulty of finding everything(I had to ask my cousin for help)was very painful. The idea of Dark Samus is also genius-thinking! She look so awsome at the end when she takes of her so cool visor that reveals her three eyes. The reason why I rated it 4 stars and I'm saying it is so good is because...Well, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not really into Metroid games. What I mean to say is that, I suck at them!!! Anyways, great job to the people who made this game and I can't wait for the next Metroid game that comes out. As I said before, ""Metroids, look out!"""
4,Metroid Prime 2,"I first got this game used at Gamestop for $20.00. I got home, put it in my Gamecube, and started playing. The first thing I noticed: graphics. The graphics are very good. Then I got to the first boss, and I couldn't beat it. That's what really bothers me about this game: difficulty. If you can get to the final boss (really an accomplishment) you should get a medal. After I beat the game, I started a file on hard mode, and got killed within seconds of the first boss fight. Get MP2 if you have a Gamecube and can take a challenge. Definitely not recommended for beginning gamers."
4,"solid game, though i liked the first more","i've written some comments [...]the game is incredible, but the first is better. i wish the story was a little more connected to the first game."
5,This game is gonna raise the roof baby!,"The original was okay, number two better, super metroid kinda satisfied me, fusion is too easy, prime one was too hard, zero mission is too confusing, lets hope this game will be just right!"
2,The game is rated T for a reason!!!,"When I first got this game I looked a the cover and said ""WOW, this looks really cool!"" so I bought it thinking it would be as cool as the cover looked. Well,it was cool, but too hard! The multiplayer was really fun but the single player was really made for a teen and I'm only 10 but I've played loads of T rated games. Overall this game was fun but too hard so I recomend this game to teenagers or if your a younger kid who likes blasting aliens mindlessly with lazers."
3,It should be great.,Metroid Prime 2 Echoes sounds like a great game and hopefully it is if things are improved from the last Metroid Prime game.Dont get me wrong Metroid Prime's graphics were amazing but it had some pretty big flaws.I say that Im more of a fan of 2D Metroid than 3D but Echoes is a great name for a Sci Fi game.Metroid Zero Mission was really good so maybe Nintendo is on a roll with this franchise.
3,"Eh, So-so","Let me put it this way. This is yet another game that does not overcome the original. I would not say it is a waste of money, just not very good. Going between the dark and light sides of Aether becomes annoying, confusing, and difficult. Let's hope the third installment of the Metroid Prime series is better than this one."
4,Entertaining and challenging,"I bought this for my son who has a Wii. After 2 years, he's still playing it (he's 16), so I guess it is challenging and fun enough to hold interest. Personally, I can't figure it out, but that's probably because I'm over 35 ;-)"
5,"Awesome. Metroid Prime 1 & 2 are the best Gamecube games, period.","When I first heard about Metroid Prime, I was so happy that a sequal was finally coming out for a normal console (I don't like tiny, portable screens). Then I heard that a new developer was making it, and I worried a little. Then I heard that it was going to be a FPS (first person shooter), and I panicked being that the old Metroid games were not FPS and I generally hate FPS. When the game finally came out though, I was amazed. It is a fantastic update of the series. The gameplay and graphics are first rate for a modern game, and yet it feels like a Metroid game. It's something that you can't really describe, but if no one told you what game you were playing, you would just know it's Metroid. Metroid Prime 2 is just as good as the first. BUY THIS!"
3,"Sweet voice, stale times","This collection is from the mid to late 80's and suffers from the era. The singing is sweet, but the songs just dont sound too interesting. I would suggest someone new to Cocoa Tea start with the Ras collection or the Exterminator Best of."
3,"A good edition, but the tab will annoy some players","I've had this book for several months and I'm very pleased with it - the print is clear, the fingerings seem reasonable, and I haven't come across any typos. Some of the performances on the accompanying CD are uninspired, but that doesn't mean the CD won't be a useful primer for players who are approaching a piece for the first time.Like others I'm puzzled by the inclusion of tab when the level of difficulty here is pretty high. I don't mean to be a snob about it, and if there are people who find it useful, then so much the better. But here's the thing: the tab is interleaved with the traditional notation, doubling the number of staves on a page. This means, for example, that the Capricho Arabe and the Recuerdos both run to six pages, with two page turns each, which is a nuisance."
1,TAB TAB TAB & CD,"Just wondering why it has sooooooo great feedbacks? If you are not a beginner you should've known the TAB doesn't make sense at all. Only the stupidest player follows the TAB's position. The songs come with the CD, it has the worst recording... or even the player. Anyway if you buy it, throw the CD away and ignore the TAB."
3,Worth Reading,"While the theme is a bit repetative I didn't mind because it's a quick read and I still found the information interesting. Ablow doesn't have some basic facts right but I didn't think it took away from what he was saying....it just wasn't where his focus was. I appreciated getting a better insight into Laci's personality because that's never talked about. She had to have her own issues in order to be attracted to and live with someone like Scott Peterson. I wish Ablow would have explained better how Scott could feel the fear of abandonment from birth on even though he didn't find out about his parent's ability to leave their children until he was grown, but I believe it's still possible. Bottom line: if you're a Scott Peterson junkie it'll work for you."
1,Freud meets Lady Cleo,"I followed this case very closely. In my opinion Ablow seems to have relegated his ""profession"" to that of a tea leaf reader or psychic witch doctor in writing this ""expose"" on the inner thoughts and personality traits of Scott (and Laci) Peterson Two people whom he has never met or interviewed. A work of fiction based on a true story would have been a more appropriate and truthful format. Disappointed."
1,Don't waste your $,"Very dissapointed. Annoying. Very little primary research..doubt the author actually spoke to anyone in this case personally. Melodramatic writing with storm metaphors drowning out clear writing(sorry couldn't resist.) While some of his basic premises seem valid,he does not back them up with examples. Mostly, he uses others' material from other books.You won't learn anything new here. But congratulations to the author and publisher for jumping on the bandwagon and selling a non book with effective marketing. OH WAIT!!! Maybe this is a case of a sociopathic author who imitataes and mimics what a real book should be."
1,Ablow is . . .,"surely just part of his name with the remainder of it being Hard! Ablowhard! Absurd! Phony! Cashing in with meaningless babble! It would be laughable if so many gullible peeps didn't swallow this nonsense hook, line and sinker. One star is way too many,"
1,Fiction,"This book would do a lot better if it was in the fiction section, albeit not so much better as the writing is appaling. It is so full of conjecture and rhetoric that one wonders how much research Ablow really did. This book is so bad I ended up throwing it across the room in disgust."
2,A bit overblown.....,"I was surprised reading Ablow's diagnoses of Scott Peterson's psychological conditions. Some of his ideas were really far fetched in my opinion. And repetative. I think some of his ideas make sense - even ones many do not agree with - such as Scott perhaps finding real love or feelings for the first time with Amber. But the repetative ""birth equals death"" was a bit much.Ablow writes at length about Scott's mother - Jackie - and how her father's murder set the stage for Laci's ultimate demise. And how Jackie gave away two children at birth was part of the ""birth equals death"" theory. Ablow shows Scott's psyche and how his sociopathy is formed as he grows up. But, for example, Scott never knew about his adopted-out siblings until about the time he married Laci - so how could this have been a part of his forming sociopathy?Anyway - there are interesting aspects of this book and some good history and juicy tid-bits about the Peterson family."
5,Enlightening,I found this book to be well-written and captivating. Dr. Ablow has a remarkable gift ------- the ability to allow the reader psychological insight that provokes thought not just while reading this fascinating probe into Scott Peterson's psyche but for long after the book has been read.
1,Disappointing,"I have been a fan of Ablow's throughout the Clevenger series, but Inside the Mind of Scott Peterson (as well as The Architect) are great disappointments. In my opinion, this book is glib and filled with pop psychiatry. I'm in general not particularly interested in the recent books about the Peterson case but I made an exception for this author. I hope he gets the message that he's dropped the ball recently."
2,Don't Bother,"Dr Keith Ablow needs his head examined. Several times, I started to stop reading this drivel because it is so beyond belief; that something that happened to someone four generations ago, could make someone, today, psychotic. The doctor did not give any factual evidence to show what exactly did the family of Scott Peterson do to make him psychotic or sociopathic. I do agree Scott's mother and father are strange, but this does not prove Scott is/was insane. It is all conjecture. Don't waste your money buying. Check it out at the library if you must try to get through this mess."
2,Inside Mind of Keith Ablow,Unfortunately this book had an essay's worth of information so it was fluffed to full book size with the inner dialog of Scott Peterson as imagined by Keith Ablow but presented as fact. It becomes a work of fiction instead of concentrating on Ablow's theory on why Scott Peterson's family history almost guaranteed a personality that would be inclined to murder.
5,a beautiful mind,"Many of us thought Scott Peterson was going to challenge George W. Bush for the presidency in 2004. Scott was so obviously smarter than Bush, and so much less murderous, and he could pronounce ""nuclear"" with the best of them.It all came to naught, but it is still exhilarating to investigate the mind of this once and future Republican Presidential candidate. He is still rather gentle -- doesn't seem to have the blood lust that Frist and Cheney and the others have -- but it seems to me that he may be a powerful leader in the GOP if he ever gets out of jail.TO BE CONTINUED!!! If you dream with me, we can make it happen!"
1,Repetitive.,"Does the author have to repeat himself over and over again?""Psychological storm""""As he was already dead""""birth equals death""and on and on and on. He does not bother to try to get to the facts or get inside the mind of Scotty, instead he hypothysizes over and over again.""a normal person would have said"" then makes up what Scotty could have said.Oh god, I was so bored.Scotty may or may not have been a sociopath, no way to tell from this book. And to think Ablow is the ""number one forensic psychiatrist in america?""No hope for america.And he wants to study sociopaths but didn't bother to study scotty at all in this book, lazy writing.As someone who shares similar character traits with Scotty I was interested in some insight but nothing to see here."
2,More Blank Pages than Substance,"I was extremely disappointed in this book, especially after all the hype on Oprah about Dr. Ablow's searing glances at Anne Bird.There were at least 40 blank pages among short chapters and large text. This book resembled something a child would read.It was monotonous, repetitive and dramatic. It should have been insightful, well researched and substantive.It was a big letdown and I hope Ablow is sufficiently embarrassed."
1,Inside The Mind of Scott Peterson,"Keith Ablow is a Court TV/Oprah Winfrey Show psychiatrist who opens his book by stating that he is indebted to Oprah Winfrey, for whom he has ""profound respect for her daily, breathtaking commitment to disclose the truth..."" He has written a breathless account of how Scott Peterson became a psychopath largely because of his parents' stifling his own personality. Looking for a substantive, scientific account? Keep looking. Ablow's book is written for Oprah's audience: short sentences, shorter chapters. Just right for short attention spans."
1,crock,"the biggest bunch of bs i have ever read. not only is this the most ridiculous book i have read on the subject, the author couldnt even get some of his facts straight"
3,"It was good, but...","This was a good insight into a sick man's mind and behavior, but I didnt like the way the author painted Laci ""as a woman who just wanted to pretty up the world"". For Laci: A mother's story of love, loss, and justice was much better in my opinion. This book did explain a few things about Scott and his horrible crime."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY,"If your looking for insight into Scott Peterson's mind, you will truly need to look elsewhere. This book is a joke.I have to actually question if any indepth research had been done on this book at all. If this is Ablow's professional opinion, I can't help but question his credentials as a forensic psychiatrist.This book was nothing but ridiculous theories, assumptions, fantasy, fluff & insulting innuendos.Key phrases were repeated so often in this book I couldn't help wondering if Ablow's only true intent was to completely brainwash the readers into blindly accepting his so called professional opinions & conclusions as absolute fact.I really have to wonder what Ablow was thinking when writing this book. It hits me as nothing more than a bazaar, fictional story."
2,The OPERATIVE word here is REDUNDANT!,"Ok, now although I did find Keith Ablow's analysis of Scott Peterson interesting, I didn't need to hear it over and over AGAIN throughout the entire book. It almost appeared to me that Dr. Ablow was trying to fill up an entire book with words. This book was definitely not his best work."
2,Makes some logical sense but not rigorous enough,"I felt the book does make sense but wasn't detailed enough to prove that the ""answer"" is exactly on the mark. I was very angry with all the blank pages and very short chapters. Nor is disociation correlated with insanity in psychiatry but with law, anything goes! He says with medical certainty that Peterson was insane but ""insanity"" is not considered a medical term! Moreoverhe knew the difference between right and wrong. The problem is he didn't care about the difference, and that doesn't indicate insanity but obviously indicates sociopathic tendencies. HE KNEW WHAT HE DID WAS WRONG OR OTHERWISE WHY WOULD HE DO HIS ""BEST"" TO COVER IT UP! If he was truely insane (psychotic) there was absolutely no evidence in this book to prove it."
2,"Good, but not the same as the original","The original publication of the Big Orange Drawing Book was printed wider and not so tall. This new aspect ratio makes some of the drawings look a bit weird. Also because it is a paper back and is tall and skinny, it's hard to see some of the drawings towards the inner edges of some of the pages. Probably worth it to find an older copy in hard back, especially as it's hard for the kids to keep the book flattened open while drawing. Or I guess putting a big rock on the book would help. I'll have to mention that to them..."
5,Wonderful Fun!,"Like all Ed Emberley's drawing books, this one is fabulous. Any child that loves drawing will be entranced by the simple step by step drawing cues.This particular book is filled with lots of Halloween themed drawings. We liked it better than the one that was more specifically for Halloween."
5,A perfect ALBUM,"Are you the kind of person who likes full-length ALBUMS, as opposed to today's constant need for a ""single""? If you like to put the CD on and let it play all the way through (like we used to do back in the day with R.E.M.), then you will LOVE this CD. And after reading all the reviews here on Amazon, I can't believe no one has mentioned what a catchy tune ""What am I doing here"" is! I owned this album wayyyyy back in the early 90's when I was a college DJ and have seen these guys play live - they have a definite ""bar band"" sound. Enjoy!"
3,Good First Mystery,"I enjoyed this book. It wasn't the best mystery I have read lately, but not bad for the first in a series. I will probably buy the other books by this author. Not nearly as good as Janet Evanovich, though."
4,Good Read,"The only thing I didn't like about this book was that I thought it was very predictable -- the killer was easy to spot right from the beginning. However, it was a fun read and I look forward to the next book by this author."
1,Not the Bozo I know,"I was all set to Pre-order this until I realized this is the ORIGINAL Bozo. That's all well and good for people who see this as BOZO, but as a kid growing up in Chicago, as the review before me said, Bob Bell is the man. The Bozo show on WGN tv I grew up on with Bozo, Cookie, Wizzo, and Ned Locke, now if THAT Bozo show comes to DVD.. I'd order that before you'd even name the price."
1,Gotta agree with the others on this one.,"Bob Bell is the only Bozo in my world. Thanks for creating the character, Larry, but to those of us who grew up watching WGN, it's Bob or nothing."
3,Feel free to kill it guys,"Although Bozo was never one of my priority items as a kid - as a historical show it's good to see it coming out. For those of you who do not understand the economics of the DVD business, feel free to blast it for not being ""your Bozo"". Once I have a sample for my educational purposes, it makes no difference to me whether other episodes come out or not - but if this one flops, the odds are high you will never get a chance on getting the one(s) you want. And just in case you missed the point, Bozo was national - Chicago is big, but there are bigger - and have any of you surveyed the potential audience to find out how many would pre-purchase whoever his name is editions? Smart money says help kill it and you may just kill it - and , by-the-by, you are putting up nothing but complaint - the rule in sales is ""show them the money"""
4,Bozo minus Miss Valentine!,"Loved the idea of getting these DVDS! Alas, there is always a downside! Where is the lovely and talented Miss Judy Valentine , who was a rregular on the show! Guess she demanded higher royalties! lol Anyway, its delightful to see these old shows! Wish there were more!"
1,I Hope WGN-TV sees this review...,"As much as I appreciate Larry Harmon for creating the character Bozo the Clown, I cant help but echo what others have said here...for those of us that grew up watching Bob Bell in the role, I would NEVER buy anything else but Bob's Bozo on dvd. It is my sincere hope that WGN TV would open its archives and that of the Chicago based Museum of Broadcast Communications (MBC) to release all that they can from Bob Bell's Bozo that ran for years and years on Tribune Broadcasting WGN TV. Between the Bozo Show and its many incarnations and the Ray Rayner & Friends morning show--that was LOCAL kids programming at its best and I think it is sorely missed by me and others. PLEASE release some of the Chicago Based Bozo Shows on DVD sometime soon!"
3,Could be better.,If you buy this manual be aware that it is illustrated - not any actual photographs. Photos would be better. Overall it just confirmed to me that I should get gunsmith to take apart this rifle and not attempt it myself in the garage.
3,Nice read,"It got too technical, but still could understand.Not for novice...such as me...It will increase your knowledge...worth the price"
4,Bargain For This Price,"For this price you can't beat the value. Seven episodes of outdoor adventure, with a likable cast and some very nice scenery. Robert Conradstill looks fit and believable as a search and rescue volunteer. I bought this expecting it to be the pilot, and was very pleased to find seven episodes. It's a shame the show didn't get a chance as you can see the cast grow as you watch the episodes. Each episode was better than the previous one. Good bargain, good entertaining show."
5,Great Series!,This is a great series; too bad it didn't last longer. Unusual characters; good action; well written story lines. Have watched it twice now.
3,High Sierra Search and Rescue,"I remember this show when it was on....it was an okay show, not the greatest acting from the younger actors, but passable entertainment...the best part of the show was the natural scenery. But good, mindless entertainment."
3,Mai-K,"This really is a great album, but most of the songs are cover versions, especially the Mai Kuraki songs ""Love, Day after Tomorrow"", ""This is your life"", ""Happy days"", ""Secret of my heart"", ""Delicious Way"" and ""Stay by my side"" would rather be worth listened in their original version!But I have to admit that Aika's singing skills aren't quite like any other artist's: Just like a mystic chant, it really goes straight to the heart!It's a pity that GIZA USA took most of Mai Kuraki's songs, which already have been released on american territory. They should have rather let Aika participate more on the album, presenting her own songs, especially as they are telling on her official HomePage what a great songstress Aika should be!?And don't let you blend by the publicity of the album, as she is as new to japanese audience, then she is to US audience!Really a pity, that newby Aika Ohno had to hide behind the shadow of her glorious predecessor Mai Kuraki!?"
3,"Wonderful lyrics, but...",I would gladly buy another album by Akia--her voice and songwriting skills shine through the manufactured sound that is present on this disk. Akia's lyrics translate very well to English--but the American pop music plauge seems to have infected the music.What Aika needs is a new producer and a live band to go with it--then she'd be very close to perfecting a sound to match her words. I'd suggest taking a page or two from Chihiro Onitsuka's book would suit her better in the long run.
3,"Capresso 503.05 Stainless Steel Cool Grind Coffee Grinder, Stainless Steel",This looks great but not that great for grinding spices. Good for Coffee grinding only.
2,It Looks Good,However it doesn't work as well as my previous one from Pavoni. The cover on the Capresso fits around the outside of the grinder so when you transfer the ground coffee to another container there is always some cleanup required. It also takes longer to get the beans finely ground.
3,NO CD,"I bought this book new from Amazon Even though it says on the cover ""CD included"" and the text refers to the CD no CD was included."
1,Not what it was supposed to be,This was listed on Amazon Warhouse as being for a PCI board but when the Video card arrived it was for a PCIe board. I resold it to a friend no loss in money but a big lose in my time.
2,Disappointing,"They guarantee 585 mg in every capsule, but they are only guaranteeing how much chopped leaves - not the quality."
2,No Noticeable Benefits,"This seems like a quality product for those who need this ingredient, but did not get any real benefit from it. I am going to try Pygeum and Saw Palmetto this time."
4,Female use,I am a breastfeeding mom who after having my baby started to have hormonal acne along my jaw line. After clearing it with my doctor I have been taking this for about 6 weeks now. Slowly I believe it is helping...I used to take spironolactone but while pregnant and now nursing I can't. I am happy with this as a substitute and do not plan to go back to spirono. I gave it 4 stars vs. 5 because it is slow to work and I am not entirely confident that it will all go away but I do see a drastic enough improvement. I take 2 pills per day and do make sure I take them with food.
3,Good value with a but...,"This seems to be a good value, based on the quality; however, in my case, I wasn't able to conclude that it was effective for treating a urinary based ailment. Bottom line: considering the concentration at this price per capsule count, it won't hurt to try. You've wasted $10 on crappier products for sure!"
2,Seriously talk to your doctor before taking this or any other supplement,"Please talk to your doctor. Or a doctor before taking this. I'm a 22 year old male who began taking this after reading it can re grow your hair. I made the mistake of not asking more questions before taking it. I noticed i would have a shortness of breath when taking it,and my heart would beat oddly sometimes if I stood up quickly. The worst problem was that it gave me mild ED(yes a 22 year old man) and sometimes I leaked urine. I don't have a problem holding it in,but after i'm finished urinating,and I zip up, I will leak urine. I think it's made my you know what weaker. It may sound like a joke, but if you decide you start taking this stuff, You might want to think about it first. Would you trade in having hair for ED? if you already have ed. Then KNOCK YOUR SELF OUT. Taking this stuff was not worth it. I don't think I got any benefits from it."
1,Didn't notice any benefit,"I took this product for 2 months without benefit. After trying Pygeum for a few days, I noticed a benefit."
1,"Quote (p.119), ""Has your zot or someone else's zot been triggered?"". Save me !!!!!","A definition of narcissism : ""extreme admiration for oneself or one's own attributes"".As I dipped into this book, one word jumped out to describe the author - narcissistic. Let him explain.From the book's second last paragraph : ""Cultivate a sense of reverence and awe about your connection to your ... world.""From the book's last paragraph : ""Approach each person as a mirror that may reflect an undiscovered or unrealized aspect of your own identity.""Textbook narcissism. He appears to live in a vacuum of his own importance, where his only connection to reality is through this elaborate zonal analysis he performs on everything and everyone. This is one way to interact with the world, and if it works for you, fine. But there are better ways."
5,A good reason to learn Greek...,"A must for everyone who studies the New Testament. Here are the earliest manuscripts of the New Testament, such as P45, P66, and P75. What is so striking is how different they are from one another; you can see how the editing process worked during the early centuries of the church, with the scribes editing out words (or putting them in!) according to their own theological views. A fabulous tool, and proof that the ""inerrant"" New Testament is a myth..."
3,More of a Primer,"I own the John Ayres ""Tomes"" titles and they aresuperb. That proved to me that John is an excellent author. However,this book falls short of its title of ""Exposed."" It is written very well, explained very well, and the CD is what it should be, but this is not a book for the serious game programmer. It is a good start but other than that, shop the Delphi web pages for code samples and look to C++ code for help. This book is a primer for beginning programmers and NOT for the advanced or intermediate like the back of the book says. END"
4,"Delivers, though probably not for advanced programmers","Unlike some of the reviewers, I had no problems with any of the examples (remember to change the read-only status of the files to archive), nor with the Delphi 4 installation (a great bonus).But this book is probably not for advanced game programmers. For me, the presentation of the basic framework for games was very helpful. Ayres' code was clear, instructive, and always worked. In addition, he does at least introduce the reader to some of the more complex aspects of game programming and shows the reader how to do some of the more interesting and useful special effects."
1,"Beginner book, at the most","One of the problems with the computer publishing boom is that people are becoming authors who don't really write very well, and books are getting into print that shouldn't be. This is one of those books. Its faults are many. Among them:* Poorly written, dry, befuddled prose* Claims to target advanced users, when it is actually beneath most beginners* Does not cover material its Web site claims. There are no voxel or 3D engines in this book. It is about 2D games development only.* Simplistic examples that often don't work. ""Shoot 'em"" does not work on half the machines in my office.The only recommendation I can make regarding this book is not to buy it."
1,What a Piece of,"This is Terrible Book, Why they release this stuff!, I'll go back to C++ and Buy a DirectX Book for it, This is totally a Garbage Delphi and this Book."
1,This book is LAME,"I got this book thinking that I'd learn the secrets of games programming in Delphi from it. Boy, was I let down. The information contained in the book is quite dated -- some of it dating to DirectX 2 (!) Also, the examples given are too basic -- I was expecting hardcore stuff. Worse yet, the lame content is framed within mediocre writing rife with spelling and grammar errors. Definitely a big disappointment."
1,2D games ONLY! Save you money!,"The biggest letdown with this book is that it only shows how to build 2D games. I think most readers would expect it to show *all* types of games -- from vectors to 3D games to those using build engines. Even the book's Web site claims it covers these things, but it doesn't.The second biggest letdown are the examples. They're too simple, and, to add insult to injury, many of them don't work. I've tried them on DirectX 7.0, and many have problems.I recommend you consider Jon Jacobs' book instead. It's a good Delphi-oriented graphics book. Also, Inside DirectX is a far superior and useful work -- get it if you *really* want the secrets of graphics programming exposed."
1,Beneath publication,"This book does not deserve to be in print. It's a horrendous mess. It does not cover what it claims to (2D games only, as other reviewers have pointed out), nor do the examples work consistently. Specifically, many of the examples have problems on DirectX 7. What I suspect happened is that the author wrote these examples for DirectX 2, then assumed they'd work on DirectX 7 without testing them. NEWS FLASH: they don't. Worse yet, the examples are overly simplistic and exhibit code techniques that are error prone and amateurish. On top of that, the writing is quite bad. The guy cannot write. One of the unfortunate side effects of the recent publishing boom is that books are getting into print that really shouldn't. This is one such book. Save your money and get a book with real examples written by someone who can actually write."
2,"Terrible quality, but only lever that fits properly","I have 3 toilets in a commercial building that call for this replacement handle. I honestly couldn't count the number of replacements I've had to make over the years, the number of frustrated patrons when a bathroom is out of order, the aggravation of having to source this and take the time to replace it. The ""guts"" of this product are all plastic and tend to break approximately 1-2x per year. What is a shame is that there is not an ""upgraded"" version of this handle with metal from end to end. Even at 3x the cost it would be a bargain if it lasted! It really reflects very poorly on American Standard in my opinion. Every other part of this toilet is good quality, except this one particular weak link. Needless to say in all our subsequent build outs I specified that we use a different manufacturer, even if the price was slightly higher. All that said, this is 'the' replacement and it functions."
4,It is what it is..,"...not much you can say about a toilet trip lever, but it isn't easy to find a left hand lever that fits this particular American Standard model tank. This one is exactly the one to replace one from a more than 10-year-old home remodel. You just have to know where to look inside the tank to find the correct model number and you can google for info on how to do that."
1,This does not fit tank 4010,It is obvious by the feedback on these parts that Amazon has a inventory problem when filling these orders.This part does not fit on tanks 4010 because the angle is not the right degrees.I would suggest looking around before ordering this from amazon.
2,Made in Taiwan,"I thought I was ordering a chrome toliet flush handle. You know, the chrome metal that is used on cars and bicycles. What I received was a plastic handle painted to look like chrome. Misleading to say the least. Also, very poor quality. I hope this thing lasts more than a few years."
1,"Glory, the wonder horse, has started a snowball effect","Yeah, horses always win their maiden by twenty lengths and set a record. How very believable. I guess it's better than his winning the Breeders' Cup Classic by thirty-one, but come on! I don't care if he IS the grandson of Just Victory! Why are they putting us through this mush. Oh, dear, he had a hard run, but managed to GET AHEAD OUT OF NOWEHRE TO WIN BY AN UNPRECEDENTED MARGIN! I hate this book!"
3,The ending is the downfall of this book,"A horse, I don't care if it's the next Secretariat, doesn't win it's first race of 6 or 7 furlongs by 20 lengths when you get off to a bad start and are far behind the leaders before the first and only turn, it is a short race mind you. They don't even go all the way around the track. This book was great until the end. If the writer could have had Glory win by a realistic margin, say 1 or 2 lengths, I would accept that. And it's true that if you want realistic go to the track, but in my opinion books about racing should be as realistic as the track. This one almost was but fell short in the end."
3,Save Thoroughbred!,"The Cindy and second generation eventing portions of the series were dark days for Thoroughbred. The plots have since switched back to racing and the newest few books have been exceptional. Just as we thought there was hope for the Thoroughbred series to be restored to its former glory Harper Collins has decided to end the series abruptly after #72. With such a dedicated following and online fan base with members from all over the world, this is a classic and beloved series that has inspired many people and provided horse fans with vicarious thrills and adventure. Ashleigh saved Wonder, now it's up to you to help save Thoroughbred. Go to www.whitebrookfarm.com and join the effort."
4,Good,"People,this is NOT a bad book! If you looked up the Thoroughbred Series at the library, you would find it under FICTION. Pay attention to that word. For all you people who are saying this is a horrible book, just because Glory's race was unrealistic,I want you to remember this series is NOT REAL! I also don't agree with all of the people who are saying that Cindy is a spoiled brat. Okay, she can be a little self centered SOMETIMES, but no one is perfect. I bet not one of you could truthfully say that you have NEVER been selfish. This book is awesome compared to some of the new books. And if you are reading this series then I would hope you like racing, and this book is about racing, isn't it? Stop putting it down sooo much! GOSH!"
3,Good Read...,"When I got my copy of this book I thought wow this is really some good stuff here. This poet golden style really puts his heart & soul into every single poem. My favorite poem was ""Sometimes I Cry"" it was so powerful... I'm a 22 year old college student I didn't cry but I felt like it. He has a really awesome website check it out to learn more about him @ www.freewebs.com/goldenstyle/"
4,A Good Book!,I enjoyed this book of poetry the author has a well-defined unique style of writing with enrinching messages. I recommend this book to anyone who likes soulful poetry.
1,"Good, but...","The author has a remarkable talent. He can see the worth of even the littlest things. He takes the everday things and ideas we take for granite and makes them beautiful. However, the book was very, very, VERY clichéd. The poems were predictable and the rhyming techniques were the worst. I wouldn't buy anything else from the author. If you want originality while staying in the urban genre, try The Rose That Grew From Concrete by Tupac Shakur."
1,Garbage,Total garbage. VPN does not work. They still sell this product but you can not get it supported by Linksys / Cisco.
1,FTP ACCESS TIMES OUT - SERIOUS ISSUES!,"Please be sure to check out the linksys community forums before purchasing this router. If you plan on transferring files via FTP, this is not the product for you. Furthermore, by looking at the forums, it looks like Linksys is either ignoring the problem or simply does not care!!!My advice: BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!"
2,FTP an issue,"We have this router in our office and after seeing/reading, and experiencing all the listed issues related to FTP I can understand these users frustration! We've been having nothing but trouble (ftp trouble) with this unit, very slow file transfer and many failed attempts at connecting with our clients. I would recommend passing on this one, CISCO, please pull it, or fix it!"
1,FTP broken,I can confirm that FTP does not work on this router and also add that throughput is VERY slow. When I contacted LinkSys support about this I was told that LinkSys no longer supports this router. I would not purchase this again.
4,Well Done Beverly!!!,"I am glad to report that Beverly has stayed true to her style. She has not lost anything. She is just as energentic as ever. Her background is wonderful and they compliment her strong voice well. Once again, another energy packed CD from Beverly. Enjoy."
5,This Book Could Change Your Life,"This book presents a different perspective on the issue of obesity in America. Our culture has twisted the image of what constitutes a healthy weight into a standard that would be considered anorexic from just about any historical viewpoint. The scientific evidence that obesity is a health risk is largely without merit. Mr. Campos exposes the flawed methodology of the flagship studies on obesity that tout the concept of health that begins at a Body Mass Index below 25. If you've agonized over losing twenty or thirty pounds and if you've fallen for the low carb, low fat, low calorie hype, you may find comfort and perhaps the ability to accept yourself after reading this book."
1,Ha-ha-ha,"I bet the other reviewers are author's fat relatives. This is one of those ""if I don't have what it takes to change it - I will be proud of it"" deals."
3,"Great book, but. . .","This is a great book. So why only 3 stars? Because from the introduction on, Campos comes across as the Fat Person's friend. His pandering to the downtrodden diminishes the very real science behind his points, all of which are excellent ones. If he sounded less angry, then it would be easier to accept everything he says-- which I do, by the way. It's just he gets in the way of himself throughout the book."
5,Great !,"Leno is in great shape and his unique voice is better than ever! I recommed this fabulous collection for those who appreciate the Brazilian 1960,s Rock and romantic ballads in a flawless voice of one of the greatest crooner whose energy and vitality remain untouched."
3,out dated,"I love Hans Holzer, but as an owner of his later, more recent works-particularly ""Ghosts"", much of the info in this book is a repeat for me, but still a good read for the novice paranormal enthusist."
5,learn to connect with spirit,"this tape is really good it will show you how to tap into spirit,also loads tips to protect,very helpful together with another book[the calling of your true self]both these mediums, are so helpful in these books and tapes,both enlightened mediums which will teach you a lot, and also make you think, buy these, and you will, believe me change your outlook"
1,Not for me.,"If you think you're going to become a psychic because of this CD, forget it. John even tells you that you won't. There's a lengthy very strange meditation on it to ""hopefully"" unleash your psychic potential but I found it bizarre. Just meditate and pray your favorite prayers and if you're more psychic than others, you may increase your awareness. At the very least, you'll relax. No need to travel to a place that holds your third eye, and some other things (as in the meditation). Love John. Disliked this CD."
3,Good for the novice but . . .,"if you are a moderately experienced psychic (or more), this set contains no new information. The experienced psychic already knows self-protection as Edward describes it, as well as cleaning buildings/areas. If you are comfortable and used to working with your psychic abilities, the second disc also holds nothing new.That being said, if you are new to using your psychic abilities or to working with psychic powers, this is a good starting place. His instructions for cleaning buildings or areas are right on the money, and his meditations for developing your psychic abilities are well done. Come to think of it, I have encountered metaphysical book stores where they were doing readings and such and not cleaning the area regularly. The result was a psychically charged but very confusing lot of energies from all directions. I walked out of that place because the energies were so confused as to be acutely uncomfortable."
1,It is not a magic show,"If you were like me, expecting to see a magic show, this DVD is not the one. This is a re-created story of two boys, with couple minutes of the las vegas show footage. I should have read the description carefully before purchasing this DVD."
5,Magically inspiring,A DVD to watch over and over again and to share with others. It is inspiring and magical~ the 3D addition enhances it all.
2,Not as nice as I hoped,"This costume is alright. Overall I am not impressed. I found that the polyester has many runs were it was cut. The velcro is not sewn on properly (falling off), it will need some fixing before my child wears it. Also when I was looking at the sizes, the size small recommended that the child be 6-8 to wear. 48 inches tall, 25 inch waist. There is no way this would fit an average 6 to 8 year old. The actual size on the package states size 4-6. It just fits my child. I wish the description said it was size 4-6, I would have bought the medium."
5,Pretty substantial for a child's costume,"My daughter LOVES playing dress up. Scary costumes are her favorite, but I've learned that hard way that not all costumes are created equally. This one fits well and looks to last at least several months."
2,Served it's purpose,"Bought this for my 7 yr old for Halloween. It looks very nice, but is very cheaply made. You can see through the shirt ~ I had him wear a white t-shirt underneath it. The chain on the vest broke immediately and the cape had nothing to secure it to the shirt, no tie or anything like that (I used safety pins). Even still, it looked very nice in pictures and was one of the better looking costumes I found. Don't expect it to last more than one Halloween though."
3,Missing items,"Package arrived on time. Unfortunately, it was missing the shirt. Also, the cape did not have any way or tying it at the top...I guess I'll sew something. Not what was advertised."
2,NOT WORTH THE COST - Don't even buy used!,"This book is not Maxwell's best book and I believe he quotes himself way too much (1/3 of the total quotes are his!). His best books on inspirational / motivational / leadership are Power of Leadership and Power of Attitude (2 separate books that are similar size books and quick reads.) If you are looking for a full-blown book try 2 of his other books, 21 Indispensable Qualities of a Leader or 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership. While I know the book is supposed to be about THINKING BIG I found many quotes from other books. There are better books out there to spend your money on.They key to getting any long-term value out of Maxwell's books is to highlight the quotes you love and integrate them into your daily life. Practice what you read essentially. Hope this helps everyone"
1,The Power of Thinking Big,A joke - don't waste your money as I did. Random quotes - just a compilation to sell another book.
2,There are better books to use,"This book is just okay. There are better books on the market which will help you much more than this one, such as GMAT review v. 12 or something with a little more substance. If you have limited time to study ( 2 month or less) go for a different book."
4,Ace the GMAT,"This book has clear answers and good questions, but there are a helluva lot of typos and mistakes in the text (especially for a 2nd edition) which can make things confusing. In the data sufficiency section tests there are no answer choices, so that makes that entire test section almost worthless. Having said that it does give you a lot of information about how to solve the various problems, but again just disappointing that there are so many errors in the text."
5,magic,"When I play this everyone get's in a party mood!I'm in my 20's and I totally enjoy this old music.Is sophisticated, chic and elegant.The recipes areperfect.I always impress my guests with this totalwinner!!"
4,How Satan Turned America Against God,"Very good book. Alot to comprehend but worth the read.There is alot to try and understand and some of which you have to take with a grain of salt.Still a great read and really moves your mind to think!Would recommend,have to have alot of time to read too."
2,Craper Mario,This game is so over-rated. First of all it takes 45 minutes from the time you turn it on before you actually get to do something besides reading dumb scripts. Then when you finally are able to take control and fight some enemies it gets even worse. NES Super Mario from back in the day kicks this game's ass.
1,Nintendo is not making great games,NOTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS GAME. WHEN YOU BUY THIS GAME YOU'LL SAY WHATS THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE OF THIS GAME BACK IN THE 1980's? nINTENDO IS IN LAST PLACE. THERE GAME TITLES ARE SO MINAMAL. Xbox and PS2 ARE IN THE SAME LEUGE.
1,Not for Everyone!!!!,"All I have to say is this game is not for 'EVERYONE'!! you have to be able to READ to play! Last time I checked not everyone can read. I bought this for my 13 year old son...who has autisum. He can master just about every game I get him but he can't read. So, for him this game was not much fun. I ended up playing more than he did and I didn't even enjoy it."
2,More volience than expected,"When I read the game review, I ordered it for the challenges with searching and logic, but took the game away from the kids in the first 15 minutes, since all they were doing was ""fighting"" the bad guys. I discourage violence."
1,Disappointed,Maybe I just don't get it but this game was completely stupid to me. First of all the premise is so bad and unrelateable to the point of actually coming accross as weird. I think you have to be hard core Mario fan just to swallow this game. It seems like the game is more about the gimmicky features rather than the game itself. I guess it is kind of cool that Mario is paper thin via Parrapa the Rappa style graphics but overall these games just don't seem on par or even as evolved as the stuff Sony is putting out. Don't get me wrong some of my favorite games have been Nintendo games but Paper Mario is just below the bar.
4,its hard!!!!!!!,I like this game its fun and hard you have to use your brain a lot. I think this game is not for everyone only for pepole who like hard games. The last level is the hardest beacuse first you have to find out all the puzzels and then you have to fight the shadow queen who is this huge monster that sort of look like vivian but a lot bigger she has an hp of 150.
4,PAPER MARIO 2 ROCKS!!!!!,"This game is great! It's very complex and challenging,and some challenges such as finding the ghost in the champion's room or defeating Hooktail aren't immediatley doable but still fun. I wouldn't reccomend this game to younger gamers but to veterans? Go for it!"
4,Good game crappy music,"This is a fun game, I just bought it now after all these years of wanting to play it. It was on sale here at Amazon and I figured what the hell. It took about 4 days to finish this game, and while the gameplay was pretty fun, the fighting parts did tend to get kind of repetitive and boring. The music in the game is also horrible, it sounds good the first 5 or 10 minutes you hear it, but after listening to the same tune throughout the entire game you want to destroy the game. The variation in the game is what keeps you playing, as I'm sure if all you did was fight baddies the entire time this game would be incredibly boring. You can play as Princess Peach, and you get to play as Bowser. It keeps things interesting. Anyway, this is a good entry level RPG, it probably doesn't have the depth that seasoned RPG players are looking for, however it is a good one for the kids."
4,The Best Mario Game Yet!,"This game is a ton of fun if you are into platform games.There are loads of partners (7 to be exact) to choose from and each partner is unique! You have to collect 7 crystal stars and a long journey has to be taken for each one!The problem is that when you are talking to someone who is telling you what to do, it takes for ages!You get different abilitys such as Plane, Roll etc. and they are all briliant!I think the best bit is the battles, you have to fight bad guys when you bump into them on the field mode! Each crystal star gives you a star attack and they are all fabulous!If you like platform games and/or fighting games then this is the game for you!"
4,"Similar, but inferior, to Paper Mario for N64","If you have never had the pleasure of playing Paper Mario for the Nintendo 64, you missed out. But this is a suitable replacement. It has an improved battle system, special paper moves, and you get to play as Bowser at some points. However, I thought it was a little too similar to its predecesor. There is a forest, a creepy old town, an ice world... just like in the last game. Many of the characters are similar, too. There also seems to be a lot of talking in this game which you are unable to skip. If you keep dying at a boss, you have to view the scene before it over and over. Perhaps it isn't as bad as I think and its just going through it twice. Either way, I was half tired of this game before I got very far. If you never played Paper Mario, you will like this just fine and you don't need to play both. It is a good game on its own, but if you didn't absolutely love Paper Mario when you played it, you may not enjoy this game so much."
4,Paper Mario Thousand Year Door,"To start, I just want to say that I love Mario. He is the best video game character out there in my opinion. This game is a really great adaptation to Mario. The graphics are amazing and really really cool. The story is also amazing. (Of course you have to rescue Peach) but it does have more than just that which is cool. Overall, I think this game is definitely a must have for everyone."
4,love mario,all the girls have a crush on mario like flurrie vivian mrs.mouze&goombella.and there is only 7 partymembers:koops bomery yoshy(renameable)flurrie goombella vivian and bonus charecter mrs.mouze still good game
4,Hard but you should like the challenge,Paper Mario is an awesome game and is particularly challenging at many parts.I've found that in chapter 4 it helps to go to Yahoo search and type in the name of the game. When you see the hits go to the 4th one and click. You will find a walk through somewhere on the site and it will tell you whatever you need to know.
3,Fun fades away quickly,"Initially after receiving the game I thought it interesting but, after playing for awhile, The fun quickly faded away. Too much time is wasted on explaining each level. I prefer the regular Mario."
3,alright It's OKAY!,"Okay, paper mario is just an OKAY. I would never say it was great. Some of it's boring and some is absolutly fun. The graphics are great beacuase they are easy for nitendo to make, and the music is fine. The story is the best part. But, it's slow, and i'm sure all of you people who gave it 5 stars agree with me it's slow. Not to much happining, and WAY TOO MUCH TALKING! if this game were a 2-D platforn side scroll game like in the 1980's i would love it. yes they could have the talking in it but if it where platform this game would get 2 more stars from me. This game also has no charm. i Do recomend it though:)"
4,It's fun long and exciting,"It is really a great GRP when it comes to Paper Mario. IT's funny, fun, Hard, easy, and just plain good. I would recommend this to anyone who got the first Paper Mario."
3,The Return of Paper Mario!,"First off, this was a really intersting game. The storyline was cool and the graphics were beyond amazing. This is a game that makes Mario look like a master. The origanal Paper Mario was pathetic and annoyingly dull-witted. This one is ten times better than any other Mario and Luigi game Nintendo has ever unleashed."
1,mario's worst,"HAVE NEVER HAD ANYTHING BUT GREAT LOVE FOR MARIO GAMES UNTIL PAPER MARIO 1000 DOORS WAS RELEASED=NOT GOING TO BORE ANYONE WITH ALL THE DETAILS OF MY DISLIKE OF THIS GAME=IF YOU ARE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO PURCHASE IT ( EVEN AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE) YOU WILL SOON SEE WHAT I MEAN=READ ALL THE HYPE AND THOSE GLOWING REMARKS MADE BY SOME AND THAT SOLD ME TO TRY IT=HORRIBLE MISTAKE=PAID 50 DOLLARS FOR THE GAME AND GOT A 20 DOLLAR TRADE IN ON AN OTHER GAME AT SLACKERS=PLAYED THE GAME FOR ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE I HAD TO SHUT IT DOWN AND TAKE IT OUT OF THE CONSOLE= CAN'T BELIEVE THIS GAME BEING THAT BAD AFTER ALL THE GREAT MARIO GAMES OF THE PAST, BUT IT IS!"
1,Is this a book or a video game???,"This was great the first time I read....er..played it...NOT! If you can't get enough of reading the paper, books, newspapers then now you can also READ a video game. That's right. Read instead of play. The graphics are TERRIBLE. If I wanted old school graphics I'd buy an old school game. Oh and if I wanted to read I'd buy a periodical not a game."
1,no.,This game was sooo easy. We beat it the first day we got it. It was a big disapointment. I would rather be playing a different game. Don't buy it. Not worth the $$$$no.
3,Too Much Talking,Though I have played this game alot and understand every thing.. My little brother was sometimes dissapointed because you had to be able to read... and he was a huge mario fan.... But also By my opinion There was Way too much Talking and not enough game play soo it got frustrating like every second i have to talk to some random person... But on the plus side the game did have an ok plot to it and was a pretty fun thing to do on your spare time... But people out there who are looking for a fun mario game I would prolly suggest you Get a Game like Super Mario Sunshine...
4,skinny mario,"did mario go on a diet or what? i still do not get how he becomes so skinny as ""paper"" this game is pretty fun so fun that if i ever play it ill write a good review on SOMETHING instead of making fun of stuff"
4,RPG for all,"Paper Mario the Thousand year door is about a quest for mario, this RPG game is the sequal to the first one for the N64, this game graphics have improved and so has the story. Once Again peach has been kidnapped... Again, But this time it was not Bowser..........someone else. It is really cool you can play as Bowser for parts of the game. This game is ok but not perfect. I actually liked the N64 Version better. I give it 4 Stars with 3 fun stars."
5,Tremendous!!!!!,"This game is a great game. It has it all great graphics, sound, and overall display. But there is just one thing missing the hook, charm, replay. The first one was unbelievible, had to have been the game of that time. Now though this is the game of 2004......well at least till halo 2 comes out in 2 days:) Besides that little factor i would give this 2cnd or 3rd place for game of the year. Just remember if you plan to buy this game be ready for whenever you come back from college, school, or work(maybe) you will want to play. ROCK ON!"
4,Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door,"It is fun to make Mario a paper airplane,paper boat and roll him into a tube or spring. Being a role playing game there are many things to do to get to the next level. Most are easy to figure out what needs done next but some are a little tricky. But you do not need a guide to enjoy this game. There is a lot of fighting involved and if you do not enjoy that then stay away from this game. There is no blood and gore. Some of your opponents are even funny.If you get stuck, there are many places that have walkthroughs and guides on the internet to seek help. It is a fun but sometimes aggrevating game."
4,Reliving my childhood.,"Paper Mario (the first one) was my favorite game as a child. I purchased this game wanting to relive some of my childhood, and it did not disappoint. On the contrary, I enjoyed this sequel far more than I had when I was a kid. The commentary is funny and well thought out, the partners are interesting, the background music sets the mood well, and a lot of other neat things. Over all this game is a good buy, if you're into a story and commentary driven game."
5,LOVE THIS GAME!,This game is my most favorite game and I will consider it to be a classic to me. It features Mario saving Peach as usual but it puts a fun twist on it! I really think they should make a sequal or a remake for the 3DS or Wii. :)
4,"Fun, a good RPG","Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is a good, fun game, very enjoyable and excellent quality. The story is engaging, the partners you get throughout the game are entertaining, and the gameplay is solid. The music seems to fit each stage, and the parts where you get to play as Bowser are awesome. Yeah, I definitely recommend this. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
2,over-rated,"This game is for young gamers. I don't know what the other people are talking about. There's way tooo much dialouge. The battles are boring, not much action. I thought the game was set up like the old Mario Bros. from NIN64. I was wrong!!! Too much dialogue. Check it out for yourself."
2,Too Much Reading,"I may be 26, but at heart I am 6. I love video games. I was sooo excited to play Paper Mario (I rented it on a month long pass from BlockBuster). Well after 30 minutes of reading, I was too bored to continue on. Not to say I hate to read... but come on, it's 2004.... the characters should talk!It reminds me of the disappointment I have for ""Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga"" for GBA. Too much reading... a side kick... a RPG.Sorry to say, I gave up on this game! I only gave the game 2 stars because it has great graphics & has Mario. Keep in mind (which I didn't)... if you hate RPGs, steer clear from this game! If you like to read stories and play RPGs, buy this game!"
2,not for young kids,"I rented this game for 5 days and had to help my 5 year old son play it because of all the reading. Every time you go up to a character (and they are standing around all over the place) a balloon pops up that you have to read. He can't read yet, so I had to stay there the whole time and read everything. (I was hoping to get some housework done, lol.I also have a 7 year old daughter. She can read some of it, but it is so much reading, she gets tired of it. Maybe in a few years we'll try it again. I don't know why the characters don't just ""talk"" instead."
5,"""EMI""","Well I was wondering has anyone faught Bonetail(the dragon at the pit of one hundred trials) and won?Beacuase I've won every thing but that,(if you don't know what im talking about if you win the game and think it's over turn it back on to that level and you will be back in rougeport and i now the dragon is down there because i almost won but i didn't have enough lives,bummer huh!)"
2,"Fun and different, but TOO SHORT","I'm not much into the style of these sorts of games but I found it fun and interesting to begin with. I had a lot of fun in some chapters but the further I got into the game, the more I realized that it wasn't going to take me very long to beat it. You get new side kicks and badges but not a lot of time to really use them. I could easily beat most of the chapters in a few hours making the game too easy and much too short. I was very disapointed spending $50 for a game I could easily beat in a few days. I was expecting something similar in length to Yoshi's Island for N64 with a few episodes per chapter but I was sorely disapointed.Bottom line: game is too short and too easy. Great game for younger players with shorter attention spans. :) I'd seriously consider waiting for the price to drop before spending full price on this game."
3,Paper mario RPG,I do not like RPG games but the only reason i have this is because its mario. I dont know why i dont like RPGs but for some reason i get very bored when i play them. So every time i played it i had a friend with me so i would not get bored and then i got further. So every time i play an RPG game is when i have a friend over. After a while it is a pretty fun game so i play it more now. The graphics r great for paper mario and the sound is awsome. The reason i dont like RPG games is because it takes forever to battle someone. U have to choose what move u want to do to defeat each enemy and it takes forever especially if its a boss. Another reason i dont like RPGs is because thats what pokemon is and i wont even look at pokemon because i hate it so much. Anyway this is fun for an RPG.
4,WOW!,"Paper Mario was great, but from what I've found, the sequal will be increadible! The emphasis on paper is a new trait for video games, being able to fold into a plane, move between bars, and roll up to bounce away. You fight for a crowd, so you can get bonuses for a good show and you can also command a team of small creatures (Possibly like pikmin). Only four party members, though, and some strange parts like an army of fuzzies right at the beginning and another of dry bones near the end. A great buy, but I'd wait for the price to go down a bit."
4,A little hard for kids,I really like this game because there is lots of action. But it there is lots of reading and this game goes at a slow pace. But there are lots of cool grahics in this game. I liked the papaer mario for Nintendo 64 better though.
4,Mario Playing Granny,I am an old lady trying to play a kids' game. I aprreciate the fact that this game explains the moves to me very clearly. I have enjoyed playing it and so have my grandchildren. I am very glad I purchased it.
4,Entertaining & fun,"Liked the game overall - people who didn't like the original Mario RPG game for SNES or Paper Mario for N64 won't like this one either. Lots of talking / fight scenes / and tasks to be performed. Some of it can be repetitive, but it's entertaining and has about 20 hours of gameplay."
5,Great Nintendo Game Cube game,"I like this game better than Paper Mario for N64 and Super Paper Mario for Wii. It's very challenging and I still haven't beaten it. I'm stuck on the Grodus boss but I'm sure I'll get past it soon enough. A little too much talking but that's ok you get used to it actually. I really like chapter 3 because your in this competition, battling against many people but you're also trying to find out where the fighters are disappearing to. Any way great game and you play as Peach and Bowser in some parts. If you like Super Mario, and if you like RPG games this is it."
3,What I have done with birds,Disappointed in the pictures. Was hoping for lovely colored pictures of the birds. These black and white were not even clear.
1,A writer's memoir,"Apparently, this book, which I picked up used, is shelved in book stores with the advice for aspiring writers when it should be in the memoir section. It's the story of a mediocre writer who can't capture character or tone, but who has developed to some extent a talent for self-observation. This is not a book for people who want to be writers, but a book for those who tried and wonder where it all went wrong."
3,Texas Chicano Rap at it's finest,"This compilation best represents what you can get from the Texas Chicano Rap Scene. Most of it I don't like, but I did buy it for a reason. One of the few albums where you can find the song ""Game Untold"" as performed by Goldtoes, Mr. Kee, Grimm and SPM."
5,Universal DC Adapter,"Received it ahead of time, works good, real professional people to deal with, well advertised,discription of product was informative, easy to understand"
1,Dead on Arrival,Looks like a great concept only it didn't work...at all. Overall cheap construction and they obviously don't do any Quality Assurance on their products.
3,High pitched squealing noise when in use,"Not sure if I just got a defective one but I tested it on the camera here: http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Digital-Video-Monitor-Screen/dp/B004VL2VROWhich states 6v, 1000ma, center +I set ""cen"" to + as stated in the instructions to match the polarity and set the slider to 6v. The camera powers on but the power supply makes a very noticeable high pitch squealing noise, as if a cap is about to blow. Moving the cable around caused the squealing noise to change in pitch. The adapter says up to 10w and this load is only 6w. The instructions say the efficiency is 80% so it should still be within the 10w max. Not sure what causes the squealing exactly but I'm not trusting it with the 200$ camera."
5,Working great,"I have now bought two of these adapters. Both are working well to this point. I'm not sure of the longevity of them. I am using these on scales. This is a much cheaper option than an buying OEM power supply. I put a sticker over the red selector to keep people from changing it, hopefully."
3,Plugs only fit okay,"Even with all the plug options, the one that actually fit my scanner did not fit exactly. Wish it was a better fit."
3,Ok product,"Product is ok, it had the voltage that i needed but tips that conecets to unit do not fit. I belive the tips are made wrong."
4,I needed a power supply for my Roland Microcube,"All the other options that I had were at least twice the cost of this universal adapter, sweet buy. I am stoked that I can play my electric guitar again, worry free and without a hole burnt in my pocket."
2,Not so Universal DC Adapter Power Supply,"I wanted to use it to play my Sony Walkman and Disc Player without using batteries, but it didn't work with either. It was a waste since I wasn't able to use it!"
5,Cool for That Tablet,I baught this for the soul purpose of charging a tablet whose main charger is broken. it succeded but i do have to put it in a bit half and half to get a constant current. been about 4 weeks so im gonna call this worth it for the 19 $
2,Worked well until it shorted-out my device,"I loved that there are adapters to charge devices, but this one is a flop. I used the velleman compact to power my wireless headset base. It was working well, but now my headset does not pick up signals from my base due to power loss. This thing needs to be remade."
1,Connector Tips Break Easily,"I did a lot of research before buying this and it fit my needs nicely. It had a selectable voltage and the other reviews were mostly positive. However, after a few uses, it stopped working. I tested it with a voltmeter and determined the connector tip was broken. There are two small prongs on the connector tip that fit inside the power cable. Unfortunately, this is the Achilles' heel of this product. This could have been an exceptional power adapter had it been designed a bit differently."
1,Stopped working after 3.5 months,For some reason it stopped working after only 3.5 months. Never dropped or harmed. Wonder why it doesn't work. I don't recommend to buy it.
1,power cord,"Very difficult & confusing instructions. Did NOT work for the piece of equipment that it was purchased for, although the specs were exactly the same??"
1,"""universal"" adaptor","It will not power my Maxtor drive- the only reason I bought it. I have no idea why it will not work, but it is useless."
4,"Nice size, accurate voltage","I bought two of these to run sensitive electronic boards at 7.5 volts. They both tested accurate on a multimeter. One star off, no fault of the manufacturer's - I'm probably never going to use all the tips. 4.5 stars would be fair perhaps.Tip - A lot of 'wall warts' are way off spec. e.g a 9v that puts out 14v, etc. I almost used that 9v, glad I tested because it would've fried the board."
5,"Finally, a small power supply that delivers","This adapter (PSSMV1) is _exactly_ what I was looking for. This is actually a _regulated_ switching DC power supply which consistently produces the voltage it is set for and runs extremely cool.I recently had a portable voice recorder fried by a Coby ""universal"" AC adapter only to discover that it delivered a much higher voltage than I set it for. For light loads, such unregulated universal adapters will deliver more voltage than desired potentially damaging electronics that don't have (enough) over-voltage protection built-in. Upon checking with a meter, I observed an output of ~10V with the voice recorder attached instead of the 3V I set it for.Even with no load attached, the Velleman compact switching DC adapter produces exactly what it is set for. The next time I have to replace another AC adapter, I will be buying another Velleman compact switching DC power adapter (and will likely even pick up a spare before the need arises ;-)."
2,flimsy product,"We had a portable dvd player that we needed a new cord for. This product worked fine, but the adapter doesn't fit together tightly and came apart from the cord easily. After about the 5th plug in, the prongs on the adapter that we needed came lose and it doesn't work anymore. I am disappointed in the quality."
4,Phish's best album since RIFT...,"Despite a bit of a lag towards the end of the album, TSOTG soars to wonderful heights that the band has no been able to achieve since Rift (which is still IMHO their best album). This is the album they've been trying to make since Hoist. They almost got it right on ""Billy Breathes"".. they have it dead on now. Phish have learned (unlike many of their phans) that a studio and a stage are two different experiences, offering different opportunities. It is important to note that the band HATES the alubums LAWN BOY and JUNTA, viewing them as sloppy, unenthusiastic second-rate versions of good songs (which is exactly what they are). While the new album doesn't have much (if any) of the long floing jams that we all love, that is because they don't really belong in Phish's studio sound"
3,Too Short,"I have been a Big Phish Phan for a while now. I just go this CD on Tuesday, I have had much money lately... When I first heard it I hated it, then listened to it more I loved it. Then some more I realized it really it is only a decent CD. Sure it has it highs the first 5 Songs. It flows from song to song. However, it is too short. I really wish Ghost was atleast 8 minutes. That could have been a great song but its like they chopped it in half. If the songs were longer It would easily be a 5 star CD."
3,Decent - not on same level as Billy Breathes.,"Not nearly as good as Billy Breathes, which flowed seamlessly from one track to the next.this one is inconsistent, at times brilliant but offset by cheeesiness.I believe they have at least one more good studio record in them. but this isn't it."
5,A great album for the experienced phan.,"TSOTG is not one of Phish's phinest. If you have heard a lot of their music, you can easliy see that they tried very hard with TSOTG to be a studio band. A very successful effort, even though they are and always will be a live band. Tracks such as ""Ghost"", ""Meat"", ""Limb By Limb"", ""Roggae"", ""Water In the Sky"", and ""Moma"" are phat tunes, but they do not do Phish their justice. The jams are only a taste of Phish's talent. Lyrics are amazing including ""BOAF"", ""Brian and Robert"", and ""Shafty"". Overall, a very good album to kick back with."
4,Why Settle For Anything Less?,"If you like Phish, you'll love this album. Although it's not thier finest, Phish uses this album to show why thier second rate stuff is better than anyone else's first rate stuff. The Story of the Ghost is a wonderful mix of jazz, funk, and latin sounds, fused with the always spectacular rock jams that only Phish can create. This one contains some classics such as Birds of a Feather, Guyute, Meat, Limb By Limb, and Velvet Sea. The album also contains an element of the band not seen on any other album. Songs like Fikus, Roggae, Water in the Sky, and End of Session contain a slow, laid-back kind of feel. This is a must-have for any Phish Phan."
4,"Different, but still very good.",It's a good changeup for phish. It's probably their best studio album besides junta or picture of nectar. They need to jam a little bit more though. Still an excellent buy. A must for any phan.
5,Mellow Gold,"I own every phish cd and this is the one that ends up in my cd player the most. The cd has a more mellow sound than phish's other works but their distinctive sound is still recognizable. My personal favourite songs are also on this album (limb by limb and rogge).This cd is great to listin to after a hard day or when you just want to relax. Overall, this cd is a must for every phish fan and also a great album for someone just starting to listin."
3,Mature Phish,"This is a good Phish album. We have to respect the fact that the words for the title song were done by TDOL and have a very interesting story. Other than that , the album is really good. 'Guyute' finally makes it on a record which to me is good. I want to see Trey try and do some works like that (in the future). The other songs are also good: Limb by limb, frankie says, brian & Robert.Very reccomended to almost any ear of music. Very mature Phish."
2,this cd was disappointing,"i was greatly disappointed by TSOTG. i don't get how anyone can compare it to junta, a picture of nectar, or a live one. those cds are WAY BETTER than TSOTG. phish's probing solos and awesome jams are almost nonexistent in this cd. yuck!"
2,Where have all the Phish gone?,"I just received the CD from Amazon and gave it a listen and am not impressed. I crave the delicate balance of fluidity and chaos in their melodies of yore. These tunes, for the most part, are boring--lacking grace or appeal. The vocals are hum drum, and the guitar plucks aimlessly. Oh well. I Guess Billy will have to Breathe again as the Ghost is laid to rest"
2,whats going on with Phish?,"Is it just me or do other Phisheads know whats going on with these guys? Big disappointment in this one- I gave it two stars, one for Guyute, and the other for the cover art. I have every Phish studio CD and many live bootlegs. Can anyone honestly say that TSOTG can even compare with Junta, Lawn Boy, Rift, or even A Live One? Junta is the best studio CD ever made, period. Phish's recent stuff is really starting to suck.The band says they are going back to their roots, but the stuff I remember seeing in the small clubs in VT was more like Junta than anything.Phish has really disappointed me.Please, someone write back to this and tell me honestly what you think of this album, instead of just assuming that anything Phish creates is a masterpiece."
4,Can anyone answer my questions?,"Alright I have to admit that i'm just getting into Phish. Hopefully you more accomplished fans can help me out. I've been listening to a lot of the live stuff and love the jams, and i like most of the studio stuff i've heard. I really enjoy this cd but it just seems like it couldve been done better. They start of with ""ghost"" which is up beat and funk-sounding and seems to introduce the album like they're going to be telling ""the story of the ghost."" It ends with a similarly upbeat funky song Moma Dance where they tie in ""the story of the ghost"" in the lyrics. It seems like theyre taking you to another place by way of the upbeat funky catchy stuff and then letting you off the same way. But if this is true than why throw in a country sounding song? It seemed to spoil the mood of the ""other place."" and why not just end with Moma Dance instead of throwing in that last minute of music after the fade out?? Please tell me if there's something i'm not getting."
2,garbage!!!!!!!,"If you people really think this music is great your all really high or just not exposed to anything good. Phish is not Sly and the Family Stone nor are they James Brown or Parliament. This set of white hippie funk shouldn't be recommend. There is nothing exciting about it and it's not innovating at all. It's more or less party music, music that can't be taken seriously, stuff that teenagers listen to. I would put this band on the same level as the Dave Mathews Band--90's---00's crap. I can't believe you people waste your money on this. Get something from the 1960's , the real stuff, our generation just doesn't have it in them to make good rock music and this album proves my statement. The playing rambles on with no purpose, VERY BORING!"
1,"Boring, generic music","This album sounds like every other jam band in the world.Bland, samey songwriting for song after song. No fresh ideas, nothing innovative, just real good musicians playing well. That's fine for cover bands and such, but where is the creativity and vision? It just isn't here. Thats why Phish falls far, far short of bands like the Beatles, Pink Floyd, The Flaming Lips, and Wilco. They just lack any kind of coherent sound or songwriting ability.There's nothing original or interesting here. Big thumbs down."
3,The best of the worst,"This album is ok. I'm a longtime fan, but the last few concerts I've seen have been a real let down. Phish's new live style is at best a strange, mind boggling groove that turns the audience into a bunch of zombies (listen to shafty. They are making fun of their mindless drug addled phans.) and at worst just totally boring. Phish concerts used to be high energy and pure fun.. Now they leave me feeling sucked dry. This album, however is a good example of the new phish -- I must admit parts of it a pretty good."
4,A quality mix of great tunes with a fresh sound!,"I find the new album to be exciting and a great listen. It's a perfect snapshot of the new songs and they do jam many of them out. Guyute is definately an album highlight, doing the song justice and immortalizing it (finally) on a recording. Roggae is a personal favorite, as is the soon to be comercialized Birds of a Feather. All in all, a fantastic contribution to the discography of Phish, the greatest band on the planet!"
2,Sooo Boooooring,"As we all know Phish are an excellent live band, but the the shortcomings of saving all of your best stuff for the live concerts really shows on this album. Most if not all albums are made up of actual songs This one, with 2 or 3 exceptions seems to consist of fragments of tunes that never really seem to gel. Maybe they sound better live, but for the most part on TSOTG they fall to the floor and flop around like, yes, a dying fish."
3,"Different, but not bad","If you are an avid Phish fan, this album will take a little getting used to, as it is an example of what happens when Phish tones down their long jams and often incoherent free flowing jams of previous albums. Die-hard fans will either like the change or hate it."
5,Great listening,"All of the Sean O'Neill Band albums capture the true ""spirit"" of Irish music. They offer many hours of enjoyment which never gets old. I listen to them all year long."
4,"For me, the best of her albums","Some of the lyrics are a little laughable now (very hippie thoughtful, self-dramatic) but the whole light, airy quality of the album makes it the best of her work. I like this album very much, but I can't say I'm a huge fan of hers (in other albums, its evident she takes herself too seriously). The ballads are lovely. Her voice has come apart since the mid 1980s, so if you're going to get something, aim for her earlier work. She does not have the range she used to have."
3,"High On The Charts, But Not In My Heart","While Judy Collins' ""Wildflowers"" album reached number five on the charts, it never really reached me. On the other hand, her renditions of ""Both Side Now"", ""Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye"", and ""Michael From Mountains"" are near and dear to my heart. The other songs just never clicked with me - just a case of my tastes not keeping pace with Ms. Collins' development, I'd say."
5,Memories are Made of this,"To my mind, the best Judy Collins album. This was the first album for which she recorded 3 of her own songs: Albatross, Sky Fell and Since You've Asked. It also gave her her first hit single, a cover of Joni Mitchell's Both Sides Now. She also covers another Joni song taken from Miss Mitchell's debut album Song to a Seagull, as well as 3 songs by Leonard Cohen, one of which is a beautiful version of Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye. If you are a fan of this late 60's brand of introspective folk music, and have never listened to this album, then I suggest you buy it whilst it is still available. I cannot recommend this album highly enough. Albatross (nothing to do with Fleetwood Mac) still sends a tingle along my spine."
3,populaire infact,"A fine book just to let you know what is that which could hold a universal audience griping through Fo is basically a italian artist. the improvisation of Fo's plays, essentially a charcteristic of popular performance is beautifully explicted through the book"
2,"Fast, Easy, and Simple","This is a super book for absolute beginners, people who have never used a ""major"" graphics program before. All the basics are explained, clearly, with examples.Those who have regularly used many, many other graphics programs may find the book a bit simplistic, and be slightly perturbed by the items that are missing. As others have pointed out Jasc's Paintshop Pro is quite different and exciting in that it combines the best of Adobe ""Photoshop"", with the best of Fractal Design's ""Painter"", and the best of ""Ulead"" -- so, if you are already familiar with these programs, you really want a book that's a bit more advanced than this one."
1,Photo Editing? Look Elsewhere,"This book is for you only if you plan to use Paint Sho Pro to draw or design. It is shockingly thin in help for working with photographs. As far as photo editing goes, it covers the red eye fix and cheesy special effects features, not much more. I bought the book because I found the Jasc-supplied manual for Paint Shop hard to use, but I've gone back to it."
5,Super Tutorial for Beginner or Occasional User,"I am an occasional user. I could muddle my way through PSP6 but have been frustrated by the changes in PSP7. This book has step by step screens to put on your PC and get you started quickly if you're a beginner.The occasional user with some experience can just read and apply the examples. The examples are easy to follow and cleared up the problems I was having, that I could not find in PSP7 help. PSPF&E also contains a 10 page Tabel of contents and a 13 page index making topics easy to find. Highly recommended.Diane states in the beginning that she, like me, is not an artist. She is however an excellent teacher. Thanks Diane.(Note: for a more complete guide with color plates see ""The Complete Idiots guide to PSP7"" which is good for intermediate users, but I have found diffcult to use.)"
4,Good value,"This cap is of excellent quality and is available in a large selection of colors. The profile is a little higher than some, so if you want a cap that fits snug down over the top of your head, this one is not for you. The price is comparable to my local walmart, but the quality is much better. I bought several to off-set the shipping costs and it became a real bargain."
2,Superb hardcopy but incomplete Kindle Edition,"Purchased the hardcopy edition 4 years ago and enjoyed reading it over and over. The content is very encyclopaedic and the pictures and illustrations are superb. The only downside is that it weighs a ton that I couldn't take it outside for a read.Fast forward to the iPad age and it's one of the 1st ebook I have considered to re-purchase in electronic form. After being indecisive for a few months, finally had the urge to buy from Amazon's Kindle department. To my utter dismay and annoyance - the lovely photos & illustrations in the hardcopy edition are nowhere to be found - even the cover isn't in color. Why Amazon?! A few more extra time spent scanning those pics would have been so much better!"
2,New Author/Bad book,"Theres a new auther writing trhe Destroyer novels..And he needs to reread the other 133 books..Remo is now Master of Sinanju and hasn't a clue of whay to do withit..The writing is teadious with no real central bad guy..The old magical carping back and forth is forced,Chiun is dimminished as Remo struggles to find clues to the case..Clues??? Remo is the Destroyer not Sherlock Holmes...Hopefully the new guy will get the point and liven things up..This franchise is struggling to get to #150..the Executioner is past #300,hmmmmm."
1,Three strikes and your out,"Having suffered through these three books( and I use that term lightly) it is now time to start rereading from #1( there is an idea, maybe the new writer should read some of the old (good) books to get a clue of the characters and where the story line is going. The series is going to die if this continues."
5,"6"" x 4 pitch propeller",This propeller was bought to replace an included rather flimsy propeller on a Bixler motorized electric powered glider. It is really strong and has good thrust for its size. APC propellers like this one are my standard propellers for this type of model airplane and include bushings for different size propeller shafts.
5,Propeller review,great propeller this propeller had more thrust than other 6x4 propsI would recommend this propeller over any similar sized propellerbecause of how much thrust it has. Buy only APC propellers
1,"Do not order from this company, VLC Distribution !","Your Amazon.com Purchase from VLC Distribution Company, Inc.I ordered this watch as a Christmas present for my son from VLC Distribution Company. The watch arrived and did not work, so I returned it and the company sent me a replacement. The second watch also did not work. Thus, I requested a refund. All this took place over several weeks. VLC Distribution Company just informed me that they do not reimburse after 30 days and I was told to contact the manufacturer, Casio (although they provided no information as to how I would do this). So I'm left with a watch that does work. Do not order from this company as they do not stand behind the product and if it does not work then it will become your problem!"
5,An fascinating and engaging study of the prophesies,"Nostradamus And The Lost Templar Legacy by Rudy Cambier is an fascinating and engaging study of the prophesies popularly attributed to Nostradamus; author Rudy Cambier presents a convincing case that the actual words were composed by a Cistercian monk, Yves de Lessines, over two hundred years before Nostradamus' time - and that the true purpose behind the words was to point the way to the concealed and lost treasure of the Templars. A most fascinating analysis, Nostradamus And The Lost Templar Legacy is a thoughtful and thought-provoking contribution to the growing library of Nostradamus literature. Also very highly recommended as collateral reading from Adventures Unlimited Press is Francine Bernier's The Templars' Legacy In Montreal, The New Jerusalem (1931882142, [$$$])"
4,Comfortable shoe,"I've had really good luck with the fit on Saucony's. Especially when new they give incredible cushoning, though they probably wear out a little fast in terms of cushioning (400 miles or so)."
1,Very skeptical,"If you have an interest in the Chinese market then you have already read the same in the other thousands of books out there. This is just a poor repeat with the author adding in questionable personal experiences that I find hard to believe are accurate. The Doogie Howser of Market Research???? Give me a break.Because I did like the pictures I give it one star, at least they were original."
1,INCOMPLETE PRODUCT!!! CHARGED DOUBLE!!!,"This was a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. It was missing DVDS. It was extremely disappointing when he opened his gift and couldn't watch the series. I had to order a whole other set from another independent seller. I sent the product back RIGHT AWAY. NOW, Amazon is saying they didn't receive it and are trying to charge me again!!! TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! What a waste of money getting charged twice for THEIR MISTAKE! It makes me only want to use independent sellers!"
3,Season 1 pkg is missing DVD #1 & #2.,"This package is sold as all episodes of Season 1 and 2.The Season 2 pkg is nice. It's in a binder type package and it contains all 6 DVD of all 12 episodes.But Season 1 pkg is just 1 DVD which is #3 of 3. There is only one DVD in the clamshell and there is no place for DVD #1 or #2. I advised the vendor of this and they resent the entire order, but it still does not contain DVD #1 or #2 from Season 1.The shows are great and that's why I'm ordering both, but the package is mismarked."
3,Not what I had hoped,"I'm not going to recap the film plot since everyone else has, and most people have seen this film. The special effects get 5 stars, the acting gets 4, and the story gets a 2. The problem with making a new star wars film after 20 years is that the expectations are incredibly high. Also, everyone who enjoyed the original films are now adults. Lucas made this film for kids, probably to hook a new generation of fans to the Star Wars Universe. But to a 36 year old like me, the film was a lot of dazzle and didn't add much to the star wars mythos for me. Jar Jar was overused, and the kid playing Anakin was annoying. The movies however did get better with part 2 and 3."
1,Incomplete and misleading,I concur with other reviews of this book. Not only is it incomplete but also misleading (e.g. ADO Static cursors are NOT read only). Many of the sample questions are ambiguous or have incorrect answers. Not a good use of your money!
1,Terrible,This book starts off with two example questions on the inside of the front cover. Both questions have the wrong page references for their answers. So before even getting to the first page there are mistakes. The answers to chapter three do not correlate to the questions. Some of the review questions that require one or two word answers are so general that there could be ten or more correct answers.This book is supposed to be an exam prep book. The exam is made up of multiple-choice questions. Why then does Michael McKelvy average forty or more true/false and fill-in-the-missing-word questions per chapter and only fifteen multiple-choice questions per chapter?Proof reading the book by somebody at Sybex would have been a nice touch.
1,Not the book for the test.,This book will NOT ready you for the MCSD exam 70-176. It helped me with about two questions on the test. The book does not cover important objectives and issues that you'll face on the actual test. This is a beginner's book.
1,Horrible - Test Questions do not match Answers for test,"The worst VB Study book I have ever purchased. No Quality Assurance for the chapter test (which is the most important thing in the book). Chapter 3 has 2 more answers than questions, and the ones that are there are wrong.Quality Assurance was having a very bad day when they published this book, and should have spent many more hours making sure that the chapter test were useful and more importantly correct.This is egg on the face of Michael McKelvy (Author) and Cybex for publishing such bad material with out checking it first.Would not recommend for anyone seriously studying for the test.I have purchased both books in the set and can only hope that the 2nd one is better than this one."
2,"A lot of logos, few text.","Another of those books with a thousand logos, but few text. A bit like the book Los Logos, this is more centered in european design. If you like logos, but don't care about the story behind them, this book is for you. If you prefer books in which the design process is explained, then you'll better look for other book."
5,it's an extention cable.,not sure what I can say to review... it's an extension cable... it works as it's suppose to. We use them daily.
4,"Nicely packaged, Works Great","The item was nicely packaged in a sealed plastic bag. It works as intended, I would say the female end is on the looser side of the spectrum but it hasn't given me any issues."
4,Works with PS3,All I wanted this for was so that I could extend the reach of my usb cable to my PS3 since I am too far from the PS3 to connect my controller with the usb cable provided. So far I have not had any problems with it and seems to charge and connect fine. I definetly recommend this as I've heard longer cables seem to malfunction when charging PS3 controllers.
4,Gets the job done,"I personally use this item so that I can use my cordless mouse from across the room while my laptop is plugged into the big screen. It works like expected.The only improvement that I would make to this product is to add weight to it so that it can be draped across a room more easily. Of course, I just put a small weight on the wire running across my front table so it stays put."
1,INCREDIBLY CHEAP QUALITY CABLES,"The only thing these cables worked for was my sd card adapter. Ipod will not work, neither will internet adapter, or external hard drive. THEY ALL SHOW UP AS USB DEVICE NOT RECOGNIZED, and there is nothing you can do. Basically, none of the more important devices work. Very cheap quality cables, so I will look towards a belkin cable. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE CABLES."
1,Mine didn't work at all!,"I was really excited to get this extension to be able to charge my iPad while using it, but it never worked! I tried it with different devices and still didn't work."
5,Great Product,"I bought this to run a hard wire from my Xbox 360 to my PC and it worked great. It was really a bargain, considering that if I were to buy this much cable from Staples or somewhere it would have been outrageously expensive. If you need 75 ft. of ethernet cable at a reasonable price, then this should fit the bill nicely. Oh, and the shipping was great. It got to me quickly and as advertised."
3,Fails to catch fire,"A gay pot-smoking private eye wannabe fixated on sex has a one-night stand with a champion ice skater and finds himself enmeshed in murder. A very flimsy ""clue"" and some psychic intuition leads back to an unsolved killing fifteen years earlier. The crux of the story is discerned early and proceeds in cartoon fashion--car chase, kidnap, miraculous escape, shoot-outs, etc. A couple of interesting characters but generally an unflattering look at gay stereotypes. This is the second volume of a series that never materialized. I have now read most of the Herren books (lots of repetition) and think he will be remembered only for the stunning ""Murder in the Rue Chartres"" which I highly recommend."
2,Could have been so much better,"If not for predictable stereotypes, this book would have no characters at all. There are lots of good things in Jackson Square Jazz -- including a likeable protagonist -- but I was unable to get truly into this book because I was always aware of the author's self-consciousness. He is trying very hard to entertain his reader and as a result prevents us from getting into the action. If he allowed the characters more depth and steered clear of stereotypes, this book could have been quite good. The story -- which is apparently based on real events -- is compelling but the lack of depth of the characters is disappointing."
1,Didn't meet expectations at all,Very slow between pictures. Terrible auto focus inside/low light where I take most pictures of my infant and toddler. Software would not load on my computer. I'm returning it and getting another Sony.
5,GALLIAN 75,Great camera. My previous two cameras were Nikon coolpix 995 and Cannon Ixus V3. I found this to be extremely user friendly with a variety of shooting options readily avaialble which are easy to comprehend within a short time. Print results were superb. Buy it and you won't regret. Good value for money.
2,Battery Latch woes,"I agree with the glowing reviews in that the color and ease of use of this camera are great. However, I've had it for 2 months and of course the dreaded orange battery lock door snapped. My wife and I baby this thing and have only charged it about 4 times and already it snapped. This appears to be a big problem. Yes, the larger battery/memory card door appears to hold it in. I say appears because it seems like it shakes around and that can't be good coming and going with the contacts. I have no faith in Kodak but I will try to call them tomorrow. I have little hope because I feel I will be without a camera for 2 weeks to a month minimum, and they may send me a remanufactured unit. $300 I pay for a remanufactured unit. I am very disappointed. My original 5 rating shoots down to a 2 because of shoddy plastic parts."
3,"Really, just average. Soft focus and exposure control issue.","I had a friend with this camera who was happy with it, and read the many good reviews here, so I pulled the trigger and bought a DX7440 after a few weeks of research. I now regret it.Pictures are often over exposed indoors. Also, you have to manually reset the camera's clock and calendar every time you re-charge the battery (not so with my old Canon). I also get lots of soft focused pictures. I do love the camera's quick shutter - there is virtually no shutter lag. This isn't a bad camera, but 2/5 pictures don't turn out because of the exposure/soft focus issues. Also, the color saturation is better with my old Canon - at least to mey eye."
4,Good overall camera.,"I purchased this camera after also considering a Canon. My wife already has the software for Kodak, so this made the decision an easy one. The camera is easy to use and downloading pictures is a breeze. Daytime shots are very clear and the camera is comfortable. On the negative side, though, indoor and nighttime shots are poor. Overall, a good camera for the price that i paid from Amazon."
4,Great Camera,"I love my Kodak. It's easy to use, and the picture quality is outstanding. I took it to the Butterfly Conservatory in Niagara Falls, Canada, and took photots that look like they were clipped out of a magazine. I've only encountered one problem with the camera: The plastic piece that is supposed to hold the battery snuggly in place snapped off. The piece is truly uneccesary, as the battery is sufficently held in place by the battery door, but none-the-less, the piece did break. I still rate this camera at 4 stars, though, because I am thrilled with the quality of the pictures I've taken with it."
2,"Good pictures, camera quality not so good","The Camera does take good pictures, and fast not like the cameras where you click and the subject is gone by the time the picture is taken (people with kids know what i am talking about) The bad things, if you take a picture from to far away ( more than 6 feet) and zoom in you get a grainy photo. Also, I would only recommend this to point and click people that arent interested in the best photos. Within a month the little thing that holds the battery in broke off and after about 8 months the dial is almost impossible to turn, seriously leaves welts embedded in your thumbs even if you succed in turning it on. IT would cost more to repair it then actually buy a new camera. I would never buy another one again. If your looking for a camera to last a long time this probably isnt it."
3,Not That Impressed,"Not a bad camera for $299 but it could use some tuning up.Pros:- 16 situation presets (portrait, party, sports, landscape, close-up ect.)- 7 Camera modes (auto, scene, program, aperture priority, manual and custom)- 2.5 inch screen- Kodak software makes for easy sharing for beginners- 4x optical, 3x digital- You can tag photos as ""Favorite"" so you don't mistakenly delete them- You can place photos in an ""Album"" for sortingCons:- Short battery life, especially when you use the screen as the viewfinder- Bad auto-focusing- Poor automatic compensation (f-stop/shutter speed) when the flash is disabled. This makes for very dark pictures- No manual focusing- No lense cap. It has a thin plastic shutter that automatically covers the lense when the camera is turned off.- 32MB internal memory- Camera menu functions are limited- Optional 2x telephoto lense pack is $70"
4,Kodak EasyShare DX7440,"Great little camera. Takes really nice pictures. Like the way the sets are placed and shape. Very happy with it. I've had a panasonic lumix for years, thats a great camera too. The body is almost equal but this little EasyShare is lighter to handle.The only downfall I felt was upon recieving there was no memorie card to insert into the camera. For a new comer this would be a big dissappointment buying this camera kit. Won't work without a memorie card to hold the pictures. Good thing I had bought one. Most camera kits include at least a 16mm memorie card in it. So do your homework..."
2,smells good but no hold,"If you look at the first ingredient of this hairspray, it's water. I gave it 2 stars because it smells so nice but it didn't hold my hair at all. I was trying to find a cheaper hairspray than my favorite, Big Sex Hairspray but in this case it didn't happen. If you want a lot of hold this is not the hairspray for you."
2,Goes flat,The first can worked fine but the second can went flat while still nearly full and will no longer spray.
2,"Works fine as a hairspray, but I do not like the smell!","My wife bought this product and it appears to work fine as a hairspray. I use her hairspray occasionally and when I used some of this I was immediately turned off by the very strong, perfume smell. This product is heavily scented and it smells more like ""old lady"" than ""cute girl""... despite the name. I am going to advise my wife not to purchase this product again."
3,"Ok for a light hold on hair, did not really give me volume","* Ok for a light hold on hair, did not really give me volume* The volume lasted all but a few seconds, I have med-thick hair* The price is good for the hold"
1,"Should be ""Buildig a Relationship with your Manager""","With a title like ""Manage your Manager"" I expected advice and tactics on how to deal with a manager who doesn't build effective relationships. Perhaps someone untrustworthy, or irrational. I believe that if you had a manager with whom the presented advice would work, you wouldn't be looking for this topic in the first place. I was disappointed."
1,GOODBYE RAPE!,"When asked why the Rape Song ""Abduction"" was removed from modern productions, the authors explained ""Rape had a different meaning back then, and modern audiences might find it offensive"" Okay, at what point did the word Rape get a different meaning? It's meant pretty much the same thing for the past 400 years. Re Censoring a musical classic makes The Fantasticks first act SO saccharine, one easily could get insulin OD. The whole second act is dark and offensive, so why remove one of the more CLEVER songs and connotation of the Rape of the Sabine Women, the same story SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS was taken from. Censorship, Political Correctness and the butchering of a standard is disgusting and, as far as I'm concerned, one of the seven Deadly Sins."
1,never received...never refunded,"i was informed that as it was near christmas, the vendor was too busy to fill my order. it was stated i would be refunded. i have NOT seen the refund yet."
3,Well sung...Poorly staged,"Based on a Victor Hugo play, Donizetti fashioned an opera about Lucrecia Borgia, an alleged real life 15th century serial killer and sex maniac. If you have never seen or heard the opera, I think you will be surprised how many great melodies Donizetti wrote for this very melodramatic opera. The entire cast sing and act with gusto.The problem is the Eurotrash production design.....no sets, bare stage, conference room chairs, a hideous greyish beige wall, modern dress, and vaudville type spotlights:) I kid you not ! Maybe some of you don't mind this look, but it really bothered me. I watched it once and when I play it again it will be enjoyed sans video. The music is fabulous."
5,Belkin Cable,I needed a cable that would go far enough to reach my desk top and not infringe on other items on my desk. This one fit the bill and does the job just fine.
5,Great,Great cables for use with older office printers. Easy to use and no complaints. Shipping was fast and efficient.
1,The below reviewers are not right at all...,"This cd is more of a 2 or 2.5, but not a 5 like the other reviewers are says. I just gave it a one to move the rating to the right position. This album has three or four good tracks and the rest are uninspired songs you might find on a mixtape. I like BG, but this album is pretty bad. He needs to get some songs with actual concepts besides choppers, drug dealing, and sex. I was hoping this cd would be good after hearing ""Make Em Mad"", but sadly, it is not. Wait for Young Bucks album"
5,Easy to follow,Even though this tape has been around for a while the basics are there. Florence offers excellent cueing and the workout allows you to increase the intensity so that you can use it as you progress through your levels of fitness. Its a shame she didn't make more videos. Its inspiring to see an beautiful black woman with such a great body.
5,Yeah,It's fun to be so non-mainstream that you're freinds don't even know you while still being cool. That's what this album does for you. It blew my eyeballs out of my sockets and my skull fell out through my ears. It was really that good. One CD with music for all your moods. They sure look at you strangely when you buy this one at the CD shop.
1,Garbage,"Don't waste your money as I did. Buy yourself a drink instead. If not, you'll need PLENTY of drinks after you order&receive it."
5,wonderful loon book,"This is the best book about loons that I have found thus far...the photos are lovely and not typical and there is so much detailed information about everything you would want to know about loons...the style is clear and concise with photos and information in tandem reinforcing what Mr Strong tells of his travels and experiences with loons and others who study them. Photos are all well and good, but when an author is this knowledgable and organized in thought, it is a pleasure to see as well as learn about these unusual birds. You will NOT be disappointed!"
4,Not very comprehensive,"Beautiful pictures, but it isn't the comprehensive narrative that I was hoping for. It provides basic information about the loon, but overall is really more of a pretty picture book. I was looking for more in-depth information and discussion of loon behaviors."
1,Still Have Not Received this item,"I submitted this order back on November 30th as a christmas gift for my 12 yr old son. The company stated that i should receive the order between Dec 17 - 22. Im like ""great"" just in time for christmas. Well guess what? Today is January 1st and we still havent received it. To make matters worse I have recieved little to no response. Unless you consider a generic computer generated letter about my order with zero info about my package...a response. I would never use this company again...further more...a full refund is in order so I will be submitting a complaint. No more Amazon for this family...we are done."
5,Perfect mysteries for kids (and adults who are at heart)!,"I was introduced to this series when I was in the 4th grade (1974)and it was one of the influences that started my life long passion of reading. Perfectly balanced with great story telling and intelligence that is not insulting to a young person. Jupiter, Ben and Pete get themselves involved in great mysteries with the great Alfred Hitchcok to guide them once in awhile. You cant go wrong with a secret hidden clubhouse underneath a pile in a junkyard and a free personal limo and driver. Great adventures in the series, there is not a lame story to be read! Highly recommended!"
5,great product,This was a gift for my grandson. He is going to be 4 years old but this bag can be used for any age kid to take their things in. Has many compartments and is pretty roomy. My daughter and the grandson like it a lot.
5,PERFECT,My daughter just turned 1 year and this bag is an upgrade from the basic diaper bag. It has more room and is much more organized. It's a Diaper Dude and my Wife uses it more than her Coach!!! THANK YOU DIAPER DUDE!!!
4,Great Shoulder Strap; Small Main Compartment,"The messenger-style strap is very handy when also trying to carry a baby (especially in his car seat). There are three decent-sized compartments on the outside, plus a couple of slots large enough to stick a bottle into. I wish the main compartment were bigger. By the time we get wipes, the changing pad, and a few spare diapers in there it is stuffed. The changing pad that comes with the diaper bag is big enough and folds up; you don't need to buy a separate one."
5,Great weekend bag for daddy!,"This is a great weekend bag when daddy is with us. I have a skip hop studio tote that I use during the week when I'm alone with the baby. On the weekend daddy gets to be in charge of the diaper bag, and it is definitely masculine friendly."
1,The dragonless dragon bag,"The bag arrived, and was exactly like the picture except it was MISSING THE DRAGON.Did my dragon come to life and fly off the bag? It's possible. But when I order a ""dragon bag"", I want there to be some form of dragon on it.Returning it.... too scared to purchase another without a Dragon Guarantee (tm)."
4,love it but,"We bought our bag early last year we have used now for 8 months. I get alot of positive feeddback on our bag. I love it, we both are big hunters and the camo it awesome and I love the pockets and the fit. The only thing is the seams are starting to rip near the zipper on the stress points. So it is kind of a bummer I need to buy a new bag soon and I really didn't want to I wanted a bag that would last. But I really like the product and if they would just make the seams stronger I would buy the product again...."
5,"Useful, light weight, and functional","After four kids, I finally found one I can carry around! This bag is very functional; not a lot of pockets but just enough for three bottles on the outside and ""spare"" stuffs for the inside. ... Oh, yes, this is a Dad :)"
2,Too Small and TIPS OVER!,"I got this diaper bag mainly for my husband so he wouldn't feel silly carrying around a diaper bag, but of course I am the one using it everyday! I am sorry I bought it. It cannot stand up on its own when you set it down, and tips over constantly. The main compartment is way too small and my hand gets stuck pulling stuff out. Definitely not a wise choice if you'll be carrying lots of stuff with you. Also, the black color shows dirt! Think twice!"
3,looks really cool,"i was excited about how cool this looked for myself and my boyfriend to carry around. it was a good hunk of change so we only wanted to have to get the one bag. which meant it would need to be the perfect size. its not. (bummer). so we're sending it back. it has a small pocket in the middle for keeping bottles away from other stuff which is nice but no other separators inside, just an annoying little flap that should of been a separator i think. stoller clips and plenty of small pockets for little things, toys, binkys...just not enough room for the big stuff you'll need to lug with an infant, like loads of diapers, big wipe bin, blankets, clothes and maybe a pump + bottles. no way. a toddler bag for sure. if its good to have two size bags this would be perfect for the small bag, but im not spending $50 when i still have to buy a bigger bag. it looks cool, if you have the money to spend. just not for us and our new baby with lots of stuff."
3,Sent it back,"It is exactly what it is decribed as, a very manly diaper bag, but it is much smaller than I anticipated. And seeing as I am much to lazy to have several diaper bags, one per occasion, we decided to send it back and get a larger bag."
5,Diaper Dude,"This item was well constructed and attractive. The ex-Marine, soon to be dad who received it as a gift was excited."
2,Not well made,"The top seam began opening within the first 8 weeks of using it. Six months later, it's a shredded mess. I'm very disappointed in the quality of this product considering the price."
2,Looked better in pictures than in real life,Quality of materials is sub par. It looks very cheap in person - kind of like freebie ($15 max value). Zippers are hard to move. Didn't feel durable at all -> returned it.
1,Overpriced for what it is...,"If my brother hadn't had his heart set on this, I'd have gone for something less expensive and better quality. I'm not sure why 3 poorly silkscreened skull and crossbones should add $20 to the price from the regular bags and it's annoying that it's made in China, with little cost in fabric and labor."
4,Diaper Dude Camouflage Diaper Bag,My daughter in-law really likes it. It has lots of compartments. I think she would like it more if it were a little bigger. It's great for the dad's. Camo is always cool!!
5,Just what I wanted!,"This diaper bag is perfect for those of you out there that don't want the traditional ""cutesy"" diaper bag, and don't want to feel like you're carrying around a purse. I've been using it now for a few weeks, including traveling across the country. It's a great size with good front pockets for easy access. The ""messenger"" style strap is comfortable, and the stroller clips are handy for hanging it snuggly on the stroller."
4,Dad loves it,"I purchased this diaper bag for my husband to use since he is a stay-at-home dad. He enjoys using it the only con is that we wish it was a little bit larger. It is a tight fit with 6 diapers, wipes, 3 bottles and formula which is what we keep in the main compartment for a the 2 hour commute plus shopping in the closest city (other than shopping at WalMart we have to travel an hour away)."
4,Looks bad a** on the screen...,"Looks better on the screen then in real life. I think looking at it close-up the bag looks a bit on the cheap side. The edges of the piece sign is not sharp, it's a visibly bad screen job. But I am sure dudes don't care about that stuff. Inside it seemed spacious, and hopefully it will hold up. The babe is not born yet, so time will tell."
4,Great man-bag,"My husband didn't like using my diaper bag, so this is a great bag with a lot of pockets to carry all the essentials. Now when he's out by himself with the baby he's got a great looking bag that is also functional."
1,"Fabulous Looking, Seems Functional but sadly, all a gimmick!","This product looks fabulous, has ample pockets, lays flat on the hip, trendy, cool. Upon reciept we were thrilled but upon inspection? The material is a scratchy sorty of vinyl-esque material. We were expecting a softer more supple nylon, similar to the nylon in higher end REI or LL Bean Gear (I mean, for the price we think the expectation was reasonable!) Instead the material is a stiff thin nylon, and the entire bag makes a crinkly sound when you touch it. I'm dating myself here but this bags material reminds me of cheap 80s parachute pants... This is the type of material you get when you get the free cosmetic case from Lancombe...Sadly we returned it and are still looking for another option. Too bad, because it LOOKS great. ~ Signed, wife of D. Butler..."
4,looking good,"Very good looking bag. Seems to be very sturdy. I have gotten many compliments on it. Only complaint is that there is no insulated pocket to hold bottles and that it seems to be a bit small. Good for short day trips. After the baby grows up, i can use it as a regular bag."
5,man bag,"I bought this bag because i don't like the typical fru-fru bags out there for mom's, but my husband also loves this bag! He calls it his man bag. It's the only diaper bag he'll actually wear. It's great looking too. It holds bottles, wipes, diapers, and a change of clothing. If you need to carry more-blankets, etc. you might need a larger bag, but this is good for everyday essentials."
5,very handy,"i love it, the big space the side poket and a good price. it also has a good fabric. love it"
3,Just OK,"I am not a girlie girl so I thought this bag would be a nice fit for me. I know this is made for men and that is apparent for sure when a buxom broad tries to wear it across the chest like it is designed. I like the style, but it is nowhere near large enough, especially if you have two young ones in diapers. If I bottle fed instead of breast feeding, there is no way I would have room for bottles and formula. I give it a 4 for style, but a 2 for functionality so overall, it is only a 3 star at best."
5,An excellent bag,"I've had this for a couple of months, and I prefer it to the backpack style diaper bag. Lots of compartments to keep things separated. I never leave without it. Very comfortable and easy to wear."
3,not as big as it seems,I have twin sons coming in March and I suppose my expectations for this bag were hard to meet. I was looking for a bag that would allow me to pack for an army and this is advertized as such. I do like the multi-bottle compartments and the large shoulder strap but if it's to be flaunted as a massive man diaper bag it has to grow about 25%. If you have one kid it's a great buy....if you have twins look for something bigger
3,Cheap material,"I love the compartments and the colors of the bag! The camo looks super cool. BUT the material is pretty cheap, i thought it looked like canvas, but it is more of a nylon. Thats my only complaint."
2,Disappointed,"Neither my husband nor I are satisfied with this diaper bag. It isn't very spacious despite its bulk. The buckles are large and awkward; I've hurt myself with them twice. I can't get the zippers open with one hand, so nothing is easy to access. I plan to replace this with a different diaper bag."
3,Good looking bag. Good size.,"Purchased this bag last October and still using it. It's made of sturdy material with no tears or even visible signs of it wearing out!Zippers have started to fudge a little recently. Not as smooth as it once was.Cell phone holder should be bigger. That was a decent enough annoyance to drop a star (HTC Sensation was too wide and too long to be securely held). I just kept the phone inside in the zippered section or my pocket, but it would have been nice to be able to use the dedicated compartment."
1,rubbish,"Great diaper bag if you don't want to carry any stuff and only want to use it for a week...The third time we used ours the tab on the main zipper broke. The single row of stitching holding on the three front pockets is unraveling, so they are falling off. The changing pad is inside, which is a pain after you've packed everything else up, picked up baby, then you're left trying to figure out how the hell to get that thing back in the bag without taking everything out again. Also, once the inside is full of stuff the back pockets become completely useless. The bag was really cute :("
3,Just ok,"Looks rather plain and wrinkly (I didn't want a frilly bag, but this one is really plain). It doesn't hold much. It's hard to find anything you put in the main compartment and all the outer pockets are pretty small."
2,not impressed,I wanted to purchase a diaper bag that didn't look like one. But I do wish I had searched around more. The Diaper Dude is bulky. It's hard to find what you are looking for in the larger storage area and it's always in the way. A backpack-style bag would have been a better option.
5,Awesome Bag!,"This bag works perfectly for carrying everything my son needs on his trips to store, out of town, etc. Very cool and trendy."
5,for baby shower gift,"I chose this diaper bag for the function as well as the looks. Dads are more involved now and this bag is not so cutsey that a guy would be embarrased to carry it. Not being a parent, but a handbag fiend, the organization and outside pockets seemed very easy to use. It's a pain to constantly having to open the bag when it's handy to have it in an outside pocket that can be secured it necessary."
5,Diaper Dude Dragon Bag,Product arrived as stated in great condition; haven't used it yet but it looks great.My husband was happy to have a more masculine looking bag.
5,Great Bag,"This is a great everyday diaper bag. Easy to carry and plenty of pockets for things. I love the cell phone holder on the strap. It also comes with clips, so you can hook it onto a stroller. I would like to have just a little more room in it though."
5,Husband loved his stylish bag,"Well made, stylish bag that my husband wasn't embarrassed to carry. Has lots of pockets for storage of random items and plenty of room on the inside for the baby's gear."
5,The best in the market,"This Diaper bag is perfect for us. My husband loves carrying it. It has enough compartments for diaper, bottle, change of clothe for baby, it is well made and very durable. Worth the $$"
1,i use them only for 1 hour........,well the image quality is baddont buy it before you try it...try to avoid the official company becousethe ship my prepaid order after 3 monthsand after a lot of email and internathinal phone
5,FileMaker Pro,It was just what I wanted. Came at a quickly. Very easy to buy and use. Would buy again from store if needed.
1,"Reads skips in outer tracks, even on perfect discs","It's cheap, but it's lousy. I use it with an XP system, and almost without fail, any CD that runs out within about 1/4 of the outer edge of the disc starts skipping, even on perfect, new discs from major labels (including Sony). The discs all play correctly in other drives. Playing or ripping the tracks again produces skips in completely different spots, and it's only the outer 1/4 or so it does it on, so many audio CDs play just fine. Not sure if it has the same problem reading data CDs."
5,Left for Live ROCKS!,"I just got my hands on an advance copy of Left for Live and it is excellent! John and the band's version of Young Man Blues is right up there with the Who's version, and the new songs are great. Excellent playing all around...this album just plain rocks! If you aren't familiar with what this band does, then you owe it to yourself to get your hands on a copy of this right away. Highly recommended."
5,Left For Live is Live At Leeds 2000!,The John Entwistle band ROCKS! Entwistle is the best and his band is right up there with him. I love this CD! Buy it or wish you did! Live R&R at its freshest.
3,Are the high points wortth the rest of the content?,"What's great: The Real me, 905, Shakin' All Over, and Young Man Blues. What's good: Darker Side of Night, Success Story, Under A Raging Moon. The rest is passable. As I find with all of JAE's solo work, the quality of his writing and his song structure is very hit and miss. I love having different variations of common Who live songs like YMB and others. At the end of the day, when I feel like JAE live, I usually choose 'King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents John Entwistle' over this one.The bass playing is excellent by the way.My advice: Buy this CD and make up your own mind."
5,Hard Rock At Its Best,"This album rocks, this is true rock and roll. John Entwisle still knows how to rock after all these years. Take any young musicians should buy this CD and they will really see what rock music is. All the musicians are excellent. I hope rock radio doesn't ignore this CD."
3,Not that great. Get if you're a completist.,"The song choices are pretty good. Too Late the Hero is one of my favorites. Under a Raging Moon, actually a Roger Daltrey solo song, was an interesting choice. Had Enough and 905 are terrific. The new songs are so-so, not too bad but nothing to compare to the older stuff. Problem is, the playing and singing of the other band members is run-of-the-mill, if not bland. The keyboards and guitar sound like they could be anyone, and whoever sings the Daltrey parts, thought he has a good voice, is not Daltrey (obviously) and sounds pretty unexciting. Worst of all, the drummer has HORRIBLE time, even worse than Moon's, and that's certainly saying something! Still, The Ox's playing is tight and fluent, with lots of runs all over the place, and a great, metallic tone. His own vocals, while not sounding pretty, are at least distinctively powerful. This one's only for completists."
3,Nice Halloween Alternative,"I purchased this for my kids to watch Halloween night. They liked it so much they watched it twice. All the characters were witty and the ""spooky"" stories still maintained the spirit of Halloween without giving them nightmares. Great production."
4,Son Cannot Get Enough,He watches this constantly as if it was his homework...Enough spooky thrown in as to make up for its Title but definitely stays within the guidelines of the stories we have come to know.
4,A Good Intro to Indonesian,"Indonesian is among the world's easiest languages to learn, with phonetic pronunciation, no tenses or pluralization, no gender, and a very simple grammar. I found i was able to begin writing ,speaking in Indonesian quickly, thus making u want to learn at a faster rate. This book focuses on vocabulary, grammar structure, i felt it was easy to follow. I only wished it had more games and reading passages.If u decide to buy this book, it is also good to get a modern dictionary, for updated words and phrases."
1,lousy,"I'm amazed that this skimpy and superficial work didn't go out of print years ago, on merit. Oh well, I can say ""The snake is poisonous."" I wish I could say ""The book is worthless."" Then I would have learned something I could use."
3,Not sure yet,"I have been taking this product for about 2-3 weeks due to having a overactive/nervous bladder. My family kept making fun of my hampster bladder. All I wanted to do was walk around walmart and not have to worry about ""suddenly"" having to go so I researched online and found that pumpkin seed is not only supposed to help men with their prostrate but women with their bladder problems. I bought particular product at a relatively inexpensive price because I wasn't sure if it was going to work. I don't normally have an issue of getting up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom just when I am out and about and have to scout for a bathroom just to make a mad dash. I haven't really noticed a difference yet so I am going to give it more time and will update again in several more weeks. If still no results then I will just keep looking for another product to use."
1,Ten Green Bottles,"Feeel completely ripped off by the reviews of this book which led to my purchase of it for $12.99 for my kindle. It was written in the most juvenile style, and the use of the word ""we"" about every 8th word drove me to distraction. I have read many fictionalized novels of the genre, and all have touched and deeply disturbed me; execpt thise one. I found myself leafing through pages (something I never do) just to get to the end."
5,Nice size and great price!,"Cute design, easy to wipe clean, nice large size, but not too big. Cannot ask for much better at less than $3!"
3,The wooden one is cheaper and way better!,"I was in the States and I bought The Body Shop Wooden Foot File and it worked like magic! Then I returned to Egypt and kept using it but I forgot it soaked in water for a long time so the wooden part became dark and I didn't like to keep using it although it was still working well. I tried to find it in Egypt but I couldn't so I bought this one and I didn't like it, the design is not comfortable for me and it doesn't work as perfect as the wooden one. But it is not bad anyway! Now that I came again to the States, the first thing I did is to buy the wooden magical foot file!"
4,Lemmens Organ Works Complete Sonatas & Selected Works / Ben van Oosten,"Lemmens (1823-1881) is surely the most accessible of the organistic repertoire if we compare with the monumental Bach or the French composer Louis Vierne. With a relatively small amount of pieces, the integrale of sonatas as performed here worth the detour. The well known ""Fanfare"" appears in a quiet but not uninteresting version. For the organ amateur, this cd is a must at a fairly good price."
5,tam iucundae quam mirabiles,"This is a delightful collection of twelve well-known fairy tales rendered in impeccable Latin. The familiar content and avoidance of complicated syntax or difficult words make them a fine choice for intermediate students. To see Latin used playfully at a time when they're not ready for Ovid should be a treat after slogging through gerundives and the like. Barocas's translations have the virtue of skillfully employing syntax Latin students should be able to understand and recognize; there's a relative clause of purpose in the very first sentence, for example. Seeing the Latin form of a sentence whose meaning you essentially know is an effective way to learn how the language works. One last note: included as a bonus is a very complete glossary!"
3,Fabulae Mirabiles,"I am studying out of Wheelock's Latin and have completed the first eight chapters. I find that I can understand almost every word within these fairly tales because the stories are already known to me, and I can anticipate the meaning of words that I do not know.My son is a quarter of the way through First Year Latin by Smith and Thompson. Fabulae Mirabiles is a little more difficult for him, so he relies on the humorous pictures in some instances."
5,Perfect for me,"Where do you go with Latin when you have some grip of the mechanics of the language - conjugations, declensions, and common grammatical constructions? This book fills that void; it presents complete readable texts for, in my opinion, the intermediate Latin student. It is funny to read a familiar story in an ancient language. How would you say ""little piggy"", ""not by the hair if my chinny chin chin"", or ""let me in"" in Latin? I notice the application of various points of grammar, and the contemporary vocabulary breathes life into this classic language. I think more reading at this level will improve my competence, and maintain my interest in Latin. Please, reader, suggest other texts of this level of difficulty for me."
4,"Very nice, but...","It's a very nice and readable book that is entertaining to read. I often read stories out to my son and he is happy to listen to them. The only downside are a number of spelling mistakes and sometimes wrong case endings. If you're looking for something a bit easier try ""Puer Zingiberi Panis"". There are loads of colorful pictures that my son loves to look at while I read to him.Puer Zingiberi Panis: et Fabulae Alterae (Latin Edition).If you're up for something a bit harder tryFabulae Divales: Fairy Tales in Latin (Latin Edition). The stories are longer and there are no pictures, but the Latin is great (see translator in Insula Thesauraria)."
4,Just what I needed,"When I decided to tell the story of the Three LIttle Pigs to my Latin students, I searched for a copy already translated into Latin. Very quickly I found Fabulae Mirabiles which fit my needs almost perfectly. Among several other well-known fairy tales, Tres Porcellis was even illustrated. The only thing I wish this compilation included was an exact English translation, which would have saved me the time and effort of translating it on my own, but that was actually time pleasantly spent. I know I will use this resource again. Consider it rated four-and-a-half."
3,"About ""Fairy Tales in Latin""","The only drawback to this book is that the Latin is not translated into English, which would be helpful for the beginning Latin student or even for ordinary parents that just want to begin teaching their children Latin."
2,Hard rock.,Not really note-worthy. If you want hard celtic rock I would recommend Wolfstone instead---much more talent than these boys.
1,Not worth reading,"A waste of time and paper. Let's see, write about despair and how bad America is. How much effort does that take? Sorry trees had to die for this trash."
5,Can we have more sustain on the B3?,"This is a great cd, solid from start to finish. Lots of jams sessions with incredible solo's. This is about as close as it gets to being there live for a performance, especially ""Turn It Out"", the keys are smokin' on this track. If you haven't seen Soulive live then you will now be able to understand what you are missing. For all the Soulive veterans out there, you will want to check out the new tunes on this cd. Neal Evans tears it up on the clavinet. He has added a new toy to his arsenal of sounds. Check this one out, you won't be disappointed."
1,Don't buy this!,The organ playing on this cd sounds like something a 2 year old would do while vomiting up lunch! A waste of money.
1,DERIVATIVE,This is not a good organ trio by traditional standards or by modern standards. Check out Pat martino or Paul bollenback to realize the truth about the organ trio. P.S. the guitarist's Jazz clown suit is just plain not cool.
4,"Not their greatest hits, but still great!","I don't know what the previous reviewer was thinking when he said he hated the selections. The selections here make this collection a great one! You get a great slice of The Dubliner's art: bawdy, political, romantic, poetic, rollicking, everything. I dare you to not weep at least one tear to Raglan Road or Dublin in the Rare Auld Times. The songs are even more moving now with the still saddening loss of our beloved Luke Kelly. My only complaint, although minor, is that the balance of the sound in some tracks is off. Some tracks are WAY louder than the others and it's no fun adjusting the volume time and time again. But with a few Guinnesses or some Powers or Tyrconnell in your belly, who cares? This is a great collection. Touching, fun, heroic. And Irish. Get it."
2,The Selections,"Helo. I love Dubliners, but I hete selections. If you buy just selections by an artist then you will know twenty songs whitch taken the money for the presenter. I think the not-so-popular songs are the best, many many times"
3,I hope you like to iron your sheets,"These sheets seemed like they might be quality when they were first purchased. However, after one washing they became very wrinkled and did not lay flat well. Also the top seam of the flat sheet was very crinkled (my wife found that very annoying) and would not lay flat. I can't vouch for their durability since I have not had them long. I have never had sheets that really needed ironing after washing, but it looks like I have some now."
2,Does Not Fit My Pillowtop,"True, these sheets do get rather wrinkled in the wash, however, that isn't my concern.......The description states that these sheets will fit a mattress up to 14 inches thick. My pillowtop mattress is about 11 inches thick and these sheets don't fit! I washed them in cold water and used the lowest dryer setting. What a pain."
4,These really aren't that bad,"My husband and I bought these sheets (in the color Sage) from a department store when we moved into our new house and have had no problems with them. True, they are sort of wrinkly after washing, but I find that as long as you put them on the bed directly after they are done drying they are not nearly as wrinkly and they would be if you let them set in the dryer a bit.And secondly, if you are really that picky about your sheets, maybe you shouldn't be spending $20.00-$30.00 on sheets, but rather $50.00-$150.00."
1,A Nightmare You Should Strive to Miss,"I was so disappointed with this book. I am a white woman who also grew up in Atlanta, and I don't identify with her experiences or feelings of horrible oppression at all. I found the book to be very tedious, filled with self-pity and lots of blame on others. The salacious title of the novel promises racy, exciting plot lines, but if that tempts you to buy this book, save your time and rent Sex and the City instead."
1,Pathetic drivel; minus 5 stars,"At first I thought this thing was a parody...it is just the most pathetic piece of writing I have read in abut 5 years and should sweep any ""worst book""contest amazon.com ever runs. The author blames her mother, men, the South, the 20th century...you name it, everyone and everything but herself for her troubles. They aren't very interesting and don't make for significant reading. I found myself laughing out loud, but not where the author wanted me to.If you are a radical hard-core lesbian socialist feminist you might enjoy this grim memoir; otherwise, please save your money."
5,love this cd,If you love the blues this cd is for you blues lover. love every song on this cd. Catherine Reed Delight Ar.
2,Didn't have much value for me,"If you have some basic web skills, no formal training in design or development, and are looking for one small book to take you a little further in all aspects of web development, this book might be worth reading. However, I found it to be too basic to be of any use for me, but I have training both in design and development. It is also already feels a little dated. I would recommend a good book on CSS/DOM for DHTML, a good book on web usability, and as for design, well, that's a little harder..."
1,don't bother.,"This system is almost worthless. The batteries fir poorly and though the indicator says charged, once in the cams, the charge reading was 25%. Third time tried, it didn't work at all. Don't scrimp. Get your chargers from the company that produced your cam."
1,Doesn't work with DSC-T5 battery,"I tried to recharge my battery when it had just a little bit of juice left, the charger actually drained the battery completely. I used my sisters charger which is a Sony charger and it charged the battery fine again. Tried to use this charger one more time and again it drained the battery completely."
5,A fun book for kids!,"Henry Green eats nothing but chocolate, and this delightful story follows Henry on a wonderful adventure as he breaks out in a ""chocolate fever""!When spots start popping out all over his arms during class, his teacher whisks him off for a visit with the crazy Dr. Fargo. When Henry loses confidence in the wacky doc, he takes off and is chased through the streets by half the hospital staff! What happens next will surprise you.My first-grader (who is in his school's Gifted and Talented program) got somewhat bogged down in this, his first ""chapter book"" so I think the rating of ages 4-8 is a bit off. The school librarian rates it at a third through fifth grade level and I'm inclined to agree. We read it as a family and my fifth grader LOVED it!"
5,Chocolate Kid,"Hi, the book I am reviewing is Chocolate Fever written by Robert Kimmel Smith. I think this book deserves five stars because it was exciting and funny. Also it was terrific. This book is about a kid who eats chocolate everyday for breakfast, lunch and dinner. When Henry went to school he had brown spots all over him and they looked like chocolate dots. Henry got mad and ran away.The problem in this story was that he had chocolate spots all over him and he looked very weird. I would recommend this book because it was exciting and my friends want to read it because they think it will be real super.Emerson,NJ fifth grade student"
4,Gotta Pick This Book Up,"If you want to read a good book you should read Chocolate Fever by Robert Kimmel Smith. This book is as good as a piece of chocolate. This book is the story of a boy named Henry Green loves chocolate so much that he has it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Henry is addicted to chocolate.This is a must read! As a result of eating all the chocolate Henry gets spots all over his body. These spots cause him much trouble. Read this humorous story and you'll want to keep turning the pages.Robert Kimmel at the age of eight thought of becoming a writer. He is a great writer. Be sure to pick up other books by this fine author."
4,Choclate Fever Sounds Good,My opion on Choclate Fever is very hilarious. I like the book because it's all about chocolate. Henry eats chocolate constantly with every thing. My favorite part is when Henry gets chocolate fever.
3,Chocolate Fever,"Henry loved chocolate . He ate in the morningin school in his room , in his cereal everywere.He was in love with chocolate . He thought he wasborn in a chocolate factory an his dreams were aboutchocolate . He started to notice some bumps all overhis body and his family took him with his doctor andhis doctor said henry had chocolate fever . What Iliked about this book is that is kind of real and"
4,Children's classic,I bought this book to add to my classroom library. I remembered it from my days in elementary school and thought my students would really enjoy it!
3,Stephen O's review of Chocolate Fever,I liked reading the book. I think other kids would enjoy reading it too. I don't think the characters are believable because they are too moody. My favorite part of the book was the hijacking. I liked the way the story ended because the kid with chocolate fever now thought he had cinnamon fever.
5,Chocolate Fever Rules,I think you should read Chocolate Fever. It is a cool story. I like the part when he gets the fever. I love the book Chocolate Fever. Read it or DIE!!!!!
3,Chocolate Fever,"Have you ever heard of the book called Chocolate Fever by Robert Kimmel Smith? It's a great book. I have read it three times because I couldn't put it down.I chose this book because I love chocolate. Maybe that is why I picked this book to do a book review on.In the story there is a boy named Henry Green and he LOVES CHOCOLATE! For breakfast lunch and dinner, guess what he had? If you said chocolate, you're right! Later on in the story Henry Green gets a Chocolate Fever.Will he ever get better? If you want to find out, then go to your local bookstore or library."
1,Our reading group hated this book!!!,"Chocolate Fever is horrible because we don't know enough about the main character to like him and the book. Robert Kimmel Smith skipped a lot of big transitions. For example, the author didn't tell how Henry met Mac! Also, the story kept droning on and on. It should have stopped before the burglars arrived in the bookThe characters and the setting did not always fit the story. The story has too many problems. It sets a bad example for children, such as running away and taking rides from strangers. The author tried to write a funny story in a serious tone. That is our theory of why Chocolate Fever is so bad.Sincerely, The Picky Pickle reading group"
5,Book reviewT,The book came quick just as desribed. No problems at all. Couldnt ask for anything better. I would buy from here again.
4,Chocolate Fever,"Henry loved chocolate . He ate in the morningin school in his room , in his milk in his cerealeverywere . He was in loved with chocolate . Hethought he was born in a chocolate factory and hisdrems were about chocolate . He starded to noticesome bumps all over his body and his family took himwith his doctor and his doctor said henry had achocolate fever . what I liked about this book isthat is kind of real and fake but I think the personwho wrote this book was thinking about chocolateor mabye he loved chocolate to ."
5,Hernan Romero rules/Viscardo can't play!,"I think Romero is one off the most incredible guitarist and composers in the contemporary guitar world. I am not avery big fan off blues,Viscardo should not be part off this great group with real players like Romero,Badrena and Mario Rodriguez! Great cd! Joelle is a poor song,Litle Dreamer sounds like Viscardo can't keep up with this style off music. Romero I can wait to hear your new work,I hope with out Viscardo!"
4,Beautiful. Creative. Influential.,"A young couple rediscovers their love for one another. Plus: infidelity, betrayal, murder plots, storm tossed waters, sinking, drowning, salvation. Also: beautiful and creative filmmaking."
5,Sunrise - An Excellent Movie,"Fans of Janet Gaynor and George O'Brien will love this fabulous, multi-faceted film from near the end of the Silent Era. The relationship between husband and wife O'Brien and Gaynor must be seen to be believed. This movie, about forgiveness and redemption, is enhanced by the direction of F.W. Murnau, who blends a sombre German expressionism, as well as comedy, into this unique, American film. There is also a fine performance by Margaret Livingston, who plays the other woman in the story. This is a beautifully photographed, and well-preserved, motion picture that many viewers will want to see more than once."
3,Sunrise (1927),"A very beautiful and poetic film. Murnau makes impressive use of several cinematographic techniques, particularly double exposure. My favorite scenes include that in which the city is superimposed over the man and his mistress as she tries to convince him to go there with her. In this scene, Murnau attains a frenzied, feverish energy by using rapid cuts, lots of moving figures and by simply moving the camera in a circular motion. The scene comes together perfectly as the temptress suddenly stands up and begins gyrating her hips in unison with the images. Very powerful effect. Another great scene is when the man is struggling with the idea of killing his wife and the ghostly image of his mistress appears and begins kissing him, beautifully illustrating how he has fallen under her spell."
4,It's time to leave the castle...,"I have to admit that I am not only a relatively new preacher but I am also a young preacher. I often find myself alone in my study trying to figure out how to make a particular text relevant to those who gather on Sunday mornings. Prepare a Road! has challenged me. It has challenged me to leave the safety of my study and get my hands dirty. Do I really know the people that I am preaching to? Do I really know their struggles, fears, successes and failures? Now, I know that I have a lot more work to do. Or at least I have more shape for the work that I am already doing. I appreciate all of the down to earth examples that the author uses throughout the book. Growing up in Northern Wisconsin, I recognized many of the places that she talked about. And I now recognize how important it is for me to know these common places in this community. Prepare a Road! is Pastor Kim's title. In this community, I have to figure out how to prepare a field!"
4,Peters is in tune with the times,"As the writings of Tom Peters have moved away from the structured management style of ""In Search of Excellence"" to the disorienting postmod style of ""Liberation Management"" and ""The Pursuit of WOW!"", many of the conventional business book reviewers are baffled. Some have even hinted that Tom Peters has gone crazy. Quite the contrary, I find the more recent work -- particularly Liberation Management -- exhilarating reading, very much in tune with the fragmented, hyperreal conditions of today. In particular, I have found the various case studies and examples in Liberation Management very useful in may work as a strategy consultant, researcher, and professor"
3,Verne,"Guess it was ok, but not what expected from this author. Would recommend it for perhaps youth viewing. Would not care to watch it again."
1,P.O.S.,"we supposedly order this one ""new"" which was suppose to work for both meat grinder and sausage stuffer. When we got it, it came opened and used, the parts and equipment were broken, and it doesn't work as a sausage stuffer. We used to have a manual one, which required less strength to grind the meat than this one. Save yourself money and don't buy this one...PLUS the policy on this company if you returned it you have to pay for shipping both times to get it and if you want to return it pay for that shipping too."
3,Great pictures,"This book is a coffee-table photo album of prehistoric art from around the world. The largest chapter is organized geographically, with examples from Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia, the Americas, and Oceania. Another chapter is organized according to where the art is found, including caverns, rock shelters, and open-air art. The remaining chapters discuss other features such as possible interpretations for the art. The images are delightful and quite representative. Each image includes an extensive informative caption that describes where it is from and why it is of interest. The main text, on the other hand, is not as satisfying, as it jumps around or mentions irrelevant details or speculations. Buy this book for its images, and don't bother reading the text."
3,Being in Control: Natural Techniques for Increasing Your Potential and Creativity for Success in School,"A VERY short book (maybe so people with attention deficit can read the whole thing?). But, some good (although brief) techniques and explainations for ADD/ADHD kids and their parents on focusing. Nice to find some alternative advice on treatment other than drugs."
1,Don't be foolled!,"This trickery is nothing more than a mood ring with a slide show. You could get better results from a Yoga and Transcendental Meditation deminstration. If you do have the money to spare, make sure you get the gaurantee."
4,Handwriting Helper,After reading this book it has helped me with my handwriting by giving me the tools to relax and boost my confidence in myself. It has very easy techniques to follow and has helped me a great deal.
5,A relyable diaper for night time use!,This diaper is very good and holds it all when you are sleeping so that way you will have less bed sheets to wash and such. I highly recommend this diaper to any who has the same kinds of problems that I am currently experiencing.
2,Fair performance,"Much better is The La Salle on the DG 8 cd set. La Salle gets at the essence of the music. Wish I could say more on the Leipzig performance, I sold the cd last yr after being disappointed. Can't recall specific, but knew was not very well performaed. The La Salle takes one on a wonderful journey into Berg's intreguing sound world."
2,Don't believe the description or the photo.,"This product is the EQ4 but it has the description of the EQ1. It's not amazon's fault. It's Evans fault. Their website, as of 2/25/2013, has the EQ1 description where the EQ4 description should be. [...]The photo is not accurate either. The EQ4 Frosted is much more opaque and the overtone control ring is larger. Again, this is Evan's fault."
3,Beaver broke within week of light use...,"Contrary to the other reviews, my cairn terrier is no freak, but still managed to tear off the beaver's tail and paws within a week of light use. Frankly, I believe that the companies have little incentive to make a durable product, because it would decrease their sales. His best toys can be found at the dollar store; plastic bottles, tennis balls, and white puff balls last longer than official dog toys."
3,Spacetraveller - Great for Product Demos,"I've been using 3d motion controllers for around a decade and I feel confident that the craftsmanship and function of the spacetraveller are superb. Unfortunately, the footprint, while convenient, is fairly impractical for extensive design work since it lacks the mass and balance of the SpaceMouse, SpaceBall and SpacePilot."
5,Things we should always remember,"I had purchased the book for myself when it was first published. The 2 I bought were for 2 quilting friends who were not aware of it. I found the book to be thought provoking, evoking much sadness, yet it brought me a great deal of admiration for those people who were able to express their thoughts with such clarity and beauty. Many must have worked on their art pieces feverishly to turn them out in such a short period of time."
5,The title says it all,"I have wanted this book ever since I saw a segment of the full exhibit, I don't remember where. Diane Herbort's quilt on page 37 is especially affecting in person. Any American who has blood running in his/her veins felt it turn cold, then hot, on the morning of September 11, 2001. I have attempted to be a better citizen ever since, giving special support to those in the military services and the first-responders, people who are willing to give their all that we may resist the insanity of that day. This book with its artist statements, is a fabulous history of the early days following September 11. Kudos!"
3,Disappointed,"I've been a past customer of the Bosch Icon series wiper and decided to give these a try. Followed all instructions to apply the silicone to the windshield, and the driver's side wiper already streaks. Very disappointed, and will definitely move back to the Bosch."
2,Save your hard earned money.......,"I will admit that this book is filled with information and reviews. However, this book really doesn't provide any further insight than what you could find elsewhere for free. Serves more as an advertisement to future PS2 owners rather than a guide for current owners. You might want to pick this up is you like to have something that sums up many games in one book, and it is certainly organized in a professional manner. But it's true value ends there."
4,GGGGGGRRRRRRREEEEEEEAAAAATTTTT!!!,"This is a great magazine, and awesome for people who want info on PS2. Great games are reviewed, such as Madden NFL 2001, and Metal Gear Solid 2 . If I were you, I would get this right away. It even is at a great price!I rate it 4 stars, because it is plain awesome!"
3,Disappointed in plant.,I ordered this as a gift. Was very disappointed. The plant was soaked in water. Part of the plant I had to cut off. Will never order a live plant from internet again.
5,son's plant,hard to find a jade plant in new hampshire in the winter--but needed a plant for my son for the holidays--could not believe i found it--came in just a few days and was even better than pictured--extremly please with product=would highly reccommend this company==
5,Over-looked Celtic Rock,"Every-one has heard of The Clancy's & Tommy Makem, The Furey's, The Wolftones and The Pogues, Sinead O'Connor, The Cranberries. What about the band that, in my opinion, first melded they celtic taditions and popular music, well here they are, somewhat forgotten but with powerful music that could almost be mistaken for ""Tull"". Give Horslips a space inyour collection, you won't regret it!!!"
2,Whiny Merton,"If this selection is representative of a private side of Merton, he is not the Merton of his published books.IMO it is a whiny, complainy Merton with very little certainty in his heart.And it is, most annoyingly, read in a whiny tone, every word of it.Maybe a short work about Merton's searching and uncertainty would be a valuable study. But not so many discs.If you are feeling uncertain you may find a soulmate in this Merton. And he may guide you through to some better moments.I got part way through the second disk and quit.I long for an audio book of some of the classics, New Seeds of Contemplation, for example, or Life and Holiness."
2,Merton's Journals Should Have Remained Personal,"This collection of Thomas Merton's journal entries make one thing entirely clear: Merton was unsettled in his life and his writings are not only ego-centric but lack a deep developed spirituality. I am not saying that Merton's writings do not have value for pseudo-spiritual religious seekers, but his journal entries lack depth and poetry. He is a man who has not found himself but is constantly searching for himself: he loves the monastery/he hates the monastery; he loves a woman/he does not love the woman; he wants to move/ he wants to stay. The fact that this man has had so many books published and so many of his personal journals turned into published books makes one thing perfectly clear about the mainstream puiblihsing industry---they want to squeeze the last drop of milk out of dry cows."
3,Get 18g instead,"I ordered this item as well as Single Stainless Steel Continuous Ring: 18g, 7/16"". The 20g item was for a cartilage piercing and the 18g for my ear. Because the 20g item is so thin it is very difficult to bend the 2 ends back to the original position. The 20g item took a pair of pliers and about 10 minutes of work while the 18g item just took my fingers and was in in less than a min.Also, the picture is a little deceptive. There is a tiny gap between the two ends. The gap is not that big and the jewelery will not fall out. I had lost a bead in one of my earnings was looking for something without a bead. I think that the 18g item will work out nicely and I may order more."
4,"Very Good, but...","The cable seems to work well so far. The only drawback is the thickness and inflexibility of the cable itself, which makes it somewhat clunky to use."
5,High-quality cable,"I just received this and have only a day of use under my belt, but no issues at all with this.It is visibly high-quality construction, as I would expect from a Belkin product, with a clear outer insulator showing the braided shielding within. They are showing off the sturdiness of the product and it works for me - I'm sold. The connectors are similarly sturdy and large enough to grasp easily with being unwieldy."
5,Great cable for the money,"I've seen simmalar cables selling for much more money, the Belkin cable does a fine job at a fair price. It works with all of my firewire devices on both Mac and PC."
5,Works as designed.,"I wanted to connect my JVC GR-D250u to my laptop that has both USB and Firewire and I didn't want to spend the money on the JVC cable. I looked the Belkin one up, found it at a fair price and received it 3 days later.It works just as it should.I am now transferring digital video to my laptop so i can edit it and share it with my family and friends."
5,Works great for a Canon HV20 HD video camera,Bought the cable to patch form video camera to PC. Works great. Quality of the cable is very good. Can't see a thing wrong with it. The signal was perfect and was able to record a blu ray format with the video that I shot using the HV20 camera. The results speak for themselves. The price was right and I am very pleased with this cable.
4,Great deal!,"This is Great deal!! why someone would spend $39 for same product somewhere else, if you can get the same product here at amazon for way less price. I would sure recommend this product."
1,Not for canon or JVC,"The angled picture of the ends of this cable make it hard to tell, but the connectors do not have the trapezoidal shape required for any of the digital cameras I own (JVC Everio,Canon Powershot, Olympus). The cable appears to be well made but is useless unless you're connecting to Sony."
1,"It costs too much, and wears out too fast!","I thought Belkin was a good name, so I payed $20 for a cable that I could have gotten for $5. After a year of heavy use it developed a short, so I purchased a cable for a quarter of the price, and it's working fine, and I bet it will last as long as the Belkin cable did. I have had trouble with several Belkin cables: my Belkin Firewire shorted, my Belkin ethernet shorted, and my Belkin VideoBus shorted. It's not the plugs, it is an intermitant short somewhere in the wire, maby it is interferance caused cheap wire."
1,I got the wrong cable not Belkin brand,"I asked for a Belkin cable but they sent me the junk cable (not a Belkin brand cable). Please don't trust this site, I ordered the cable because it says I will get the Belking brand cable for $7 but the cable they had sent me was not a Belkin brand, it is a junk cable, I hope it cost not more than 50cents.Before you place an order make sure you are getting the right product......Bad experience."
4,Monster storage,I have has this now for 4 months... I haven't had any problems...I use it for more than backup...
5,perfect paper,"The cover makes a salior feel at home with the picture of a chart, but also makes a person remember the love of griffen and sabine. having the spiral makes it easier to right, no matter which hand is the strongest. the paper is heavy making it easy for either pictures, words, paintings, or any of the above. it is very reasonable in price for the quality of journal you will receive. i highly recommend capolan."
4,Useful clinical book of protocols for hand therapy,This book has been helpful in following a hand/UE protocol when you have not received one from the doctor. It also helps if your a new therapist and are not sure where to start with your patient.
4,Another book I push at my friends!,"A young anthropologist is confronted with a quagmire ethical and moral ambiguity as ideals and unconscious assumptions meet the reality of living within a human community. Witch trials and a smallpox epidemic provide a dramatic context for problems familiar to anyone living among strangers, whether in the next town or the next continent. Along the way, Return to Laughter also serves as an engaging, impressionistic, ethnography. In fact, I'm amazed at how many different layers of book Smith Bowen has squeezed into such a quick read."
5,The perfect rainy day book,I first read this book as part of an anthropology course in 1969. Since then I have read it at least once each year. Its insights into human nature and the commonalities found in all cultures are exceptional. It is easy to read and a joy to come back to again and again.
3,Good general knowledge,"I bought this with the hope of new information but was a bit disappointed. Although this book has plenty of useful information, for those of us who have been involved with RLS for many years, this did not provide any new insight to the cause or treatment. For someone newly diagnosed or for uninformed physicians, this book is great."
4,Good reading,I found out things about restless legs that I didn't know. This was helpful in learning about the problem I have.
5,Excellent collection,"There's not much I can add to what has already been written about this guitarist, but I can tell you the titles of the albums included in the collection (which I wasn't able to find before buying it):1961 - Apresentando Baden Powell e seu violao1961 - Um Violao na Madrugada1963 - Baden Powell swings with Jimmy Pratt1963 - Baden Powell a vontade1966 - Os Afro-Sambas de Baden e Vinicius1966 - Tempo feliz1966 - Ao vivo no teatro Santa Rosa1968 - O som de Baden Powell1968 - Os Originais Do Samba (Show/Recital) - Baden e Marcia1969 - 27 Horas de Estudio1970 - As Musicas de Baden Powell e Paulo Cesar Pinheiro, Os Cantores da Lapinha1971 - Estudos1972 - E de leiThe set is nicely packaged, with what I believe to be the original front and back cover art with liner notes reprinted, though not translated."
1,a loser at any price,"I purchased this item and found when it arrived that it did absolutely nothing. It did not buzz nor did the eyes light up as advertised. I notified the customer service department and received an e-mail stating that the person would have to check on my order. Two months later, nothing has happened. I have a worthless piece of junk and have been brushed off by the so called ""customer service"". I will not be doing business with this company again despite the fact that I was satisfied with the other items that I received in the same shipment."
3,Inconsistent,"The Borodin's recording of the Shostakovich quartets is the historical benchmark performance. This recording of Tchaikovsky's is sadly not as well prepared. The quartet is out of tune at several points throughout the set, and at some points the energy and intensity lag. Other spots are incredibly exciting and come off very effectively, though in my opinion you'd be better off finding a more contemporary recording."
2,not happy,"Don't waste your money; for the price, they do not hold heat; won;t stay closed. Other brands give you liners to go with the botties. Susan."
2,Won't Stay On,These need either a draw string or elastic; they are too large for a size 8 woman's foot! They fall off.
2,booties arn't necessary,"I found these booties too big and with no way to adjust them, so they just fall off. I don't use them now. I just use the plastic liners."
3,Not inspiring,"These are not the original hit recordings. If the songs on this CD had been released in place of the originals, they would not have been hits. They're not bad, but they don't have energy of the originals, nor even a similar sound."
4,Celtic Perfection,"Some of the most beautiful celtic songs sung by a woman with a truly amazing voice, and set to music by a truly talented band. Definitally a keeper."
1,DO NOT ORDER!,Do not order from this seller! She had a month to ship by book order and it never came! She did not respond to any of my emails either.
2,The seller did not include the CD and refused to answer emails.,"There are errors in the text of this book. The seller marked up the book and did not send the CD from the book. Contact with the seller was attempted several times, with no reply. I would not use this book as and instructor nor would I buy from this seller again."
4,An excellent read if you like action.,"Great book! Not quite up to the first book, ""Working on the Edge"", but great. The author spares the reader all the scientific, high-tech bs of the ""Perfect Storm"", and gets down and dirty."
4,This book will make you shiver!,"I enjoyed this book alot. All the stories deal with survival at sea in the waters off Alaska. The stories are kind of repetitive but if you like the first one you'll like the rest. The thought of finding one's self in the frigid Alaskan waters will make you pull an extra blanket on while you read. My only real complaint is that I would have liked more details on the fishermen involved (background, etc) so it wouldn't just have been names floating out there in the ocean. Overall, highly recommended adventure reading."
5,Hard to put down!,I have heard that King Crab fishing was dangerous. Spike Walker lets you know exactly what it is really like. I have a whole new respect for those who bring in our King Crab! This book brought many a tear.
3,"Easy, Interesting and Informative",I found Spike Walker's accounts of breath-taking rescues in the frigid coastal waters of Alaska to be easy and interesting reading. The heroic actions of coastguard aviators and fishermen to come to the aid of their tragedy-stricken fellows is compelling. I would recommend this book to all who enjoy adventure on the high seas.
4,Amazing survival stories,"Excellent book. Spike Walker is a good story teller. His other book ""Coming Back Alive is excellent as well."
4,"L'chai-im, l'chai-im, to Cannonball!","Fiddler On the Roof has always been my most favorite musical. I've watched it trillion times and I just adore everything about it. In addition to this I'm a true jazz fan, I adore the sound of the sax and I like Cannonball very much. So it's a ""can't get any better"" kind of CD to me. Cannonball's true genious takes you to another world.. The songs are great.. What's not to like?! Well, for one thing he didn't play ""If I Were a Rich Man"". That could have made the recording perfect. After all isn't that the most famous song of the musical?But it includes my favorite, ""To Life"" and Cannonball plays it totally wonderful.If you like jazz and/or the musical itself You have to own this CD."
3,"Great playing, poor mix","I have fond recollections of this LP from many years ago, but I am dissappointed in the CD. Sure the playing is great but the mix is absolutely terrible...flute too loud, flute too soft, drums too loud, drums too soft, leaky embouchure front and center on the ballads. The LP had a smoother sound, and the group sounded like they meshed. This sounds like 6 guys playing in different rooms. I am sure the original tapes were not of the highest quality, but they should have been left alone."
5,Excellent Character Study,"Tom Noonan and Shawn Wallace, of My Dinner with Andre fame, give exemplary performances as a new age 'authentic' therapist and a new age wreck respectively. When Wallace's character shows up unexpectedly, with his wife, at the therapists home the results are startling and sweet but not unexpected. This movie unfolds with a subtle brilliance and pace that is not often seen in American productions.The Wife is well worth the rental but it is unlikely that the chain video stores will have it as a part of their collections. You might have to borrow it from a friend or buy it. Sadly the DVD is very sparse and has few extras but that shouldn't deter you from seeing it.It is a great accompaniment to a winter's dinner of penne in a light clam sauce with a bottle of merlot slightly chilled. For dessert a rice pudding would be appropriate."
3,rainy afternoon entertainment,"The acting is actually good, it's just a slow play. I had to watch it for an assignment which was not based on the content, rather on the situation. Reminded me of a Woody Allen play."
5,Classic,"This is a classic! This is one of the best books ever written about chess and the author doesn't actually teach you anything about chess. At work we implemented this program with the kids and the results were absolutely amazing; however, it does take an enormous amount of time and effort, but if you want to make progress, it is worth it.The advice in this book is not for everyone, but if you want to get better quickly, this is the way to accomplish that goal. We applied this concept to the endgame, and again it resulted in some results that we never imagined.So if you are a serious chess player and want to make progress this is the book to buy. Now having said that here is the whole book in a few words - study thousands of combinations!"
4,Great book.,I think Michael de la Maza wrote a very useful book on chess. I have read it and apply his recommendations and they work.
2,This book isn't for everybody,"The book explains how the author went from Class E to Expert in two years in a three-phase program. The first phase is a series of drills, such as putting the knight in the center of the board and finding the least number of moves to get to each square of the board, to be repeated over and over. Many people might feel a little dopey, not to mention bored, following through on this. And the drills are not really explained in detail, nor are any answers given. The second phase is to buy the software CT-ART (purchased separately) and go through its 1000 problems 7 times. The book suggests a particular schedule for doing this, with each pass twice as fast as the preceding. The third phase is some simplistic strategic guidelines (since the author's own experience was that he actually couldn't quite make it all the way to Expert just with tactical training). The book strikes me as more on the lines of a motivational, self-help kind of work; there's not much chess in it."
1,Very Poorly Written Book,"As a chess coach for those rated between 0 and 1750 USCF, I consistently search for books to help my students. Of course I've noticed this book while browsing and decided to rent it from a library.Here is my conclusion regarding this book:1) The author of this book understands LESS chess than the A-class player or expert.2) The author does not understand how to evaluate positions.3) The author suggests a computer-analysis type of approach to chess which in reality is not right.4) This book is considered a terrible work...5) I agree - this in reality is one of the worst chess books I've come across - it is filled with incorrect content!Instead go buy a Jeremy Silman or Yasser Seirawan book..."
2,Read the articles on the web and save $$$,"I have nothing against the content of the book, except that it's just a slight expansion of the articles you can find on the web. The chess vision exercises are okay, but if you search for Dan Heisman's articles you'll find better. I wonder about a chess program that takes 1500 hours to jump to 2 grades. Perhaps a bit more insight and less drilling might cut this in half. If your looking for insight skip this book the author has none. So if you want the book in a nut shell practice simple chess positions lots and lots of times. His training method does work, I make fewer dumb mistakes against Fritz 8.0, but why pay for it.The author recomends CT_ART 3.0 instead of chess book problems. For my money Polgar's 5334 Problems is far better than program."
2,A disappointment,"To be fair I must begin saying the ""chess vision"" exercises were helpful and interesting, but the book as a whole is more of an infomercial for other books and resources. Definitely not a good resource for one's chess library. You can get the same information from various online sources."
1,It won't necessarily work for everyone,"The author proposes and interesting way of improving one's rating: tactics, and only tactics.He recommends you spend up to 8 hours a day solving tactical chess postions. You're not supposed to take a break even if you are on vacation or sick.Now, this may have worked for the author, but not necessarily for everyone else (he went from a D player to an Expert in the period of October 1999 until October 2001. He hasn't played since [this review is being written February 2003]).Had he taken a large number of students who followed his method and stated that a certain percentage increased so many points would be acceptable: but he's taken himself as the only example for his method's success: quite a small statistical sample.I'd say that anybody who spends as much time studying chess as the author proposes would improve following a different improvement method (like Silman's ""How to reassess your chess"") that would be more balanced."
3,Software Plug,"Many of Michael de la Maza's suggestions sound worthwhile and I intend to try them. The author's recommendations that class players devote a great deal of time to tactical study jibes with advice from Dan Heisman and other fine chess instructors. My reservation here is that a large portion of the book seems to be shilling for a specific brand of chess software. (The software is only available for PC, so that automatically leaves us MAC users out of the game.) Then, the author goes on to say that doing his program from tactical-exercise books is ""far inferior"" to using the software. This leaves one with the impression that unless you do the ""Seven Circles"" program with the software, you will be doing it only ""half-strength."" The author also devotes too much space to customer ""testimonials."" However, I applaud de la Maza's tenacity and success in boosting his rating so many points in relatively litttle time."
1,Cheating,"I don't think there is any absolute true either in chess or in life. Consequently, the method that the author suggests can work for some people and can't for somebody else. Personally, I think some ideas like the tactical drill are useful and they can actually help a beginner to improve. Basically I think the ideas in the book should deserve something like three starts. So, why I gave to the book only one star? The fact is that the ideas deserve three stars but the book itself it is an attempt to cheat the reader/buyer. De la Maza wrote in 2000 an article in two parts published on line `400 Points in 400 Days' The book, which was published a year later, give the same information of the articles. It's just inflated with big pictures a couple of exercises/examples and some bla-bla-bla but if you have read the articles, you won't learn anything new from it.So, my advice is: go to chesscafe.com, download the two parts of the article and save your money for something else."
3,Chess Should be Fun,"I read the book, and although I haven't myself practiced the method described in it, I would like to make my statement on the subject.First of all, De La Maza might have gotten it right, and it certainly seems he has a point. That's why I'm giving it 3 stars.However, the reasons for my disapproval of the book are:1. The person who wants to benefit from the Author's method should have nothing else to do in life except for this program. He shouldn't work, get married or raise children. He can hardly eat and sleep. Which makes this program impractical for the vast majority of the people.2. Last but not least, it's no fun !! Really. It's not fun at all doing all those Chess Vision Drills. It's exhausting, boring and irksome. And hey, Chess should first of all be fun. That's above all. And De La Maza's program is definitely not fun."
4,Australian SF Reader,"Cyberpunk with a bit more of a post-apocalyptic flavour. Parish Pleiss is either a gun moll with a muscle function, or muscle with a gun moll function, as she is decent enough looking to attract a local crime lord's attention. She does what she has to do to get by.Set in the 'Tert', a regional part of Australia that has suffered a lot of degradation, and the people there are kept out of Viva City, which is presumably probably Sydney of some sort, because they do not have any money.Parrish gets caught up in a plot involving genetics, information, possible alien parasites, among other things. She ends up breaking out of her situation and involved in something with much higher stakes."
3,The mystery behind the man,"This is a fascinating in-depth look 'behind the scenes' into the life of Sherlock Holmes' creator.Whether your interest lies in the Sherlock Holmes stories, or just you crave more information on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, this movie is sure to satisfy. As one of the latter group, The Madness of Sherlock Holmes revealed much more about the man than I'd ever have imagined."
1,"Terrible, Terrible,,A waste of Time","This is my first review on Amazon, for any item, never mind a video. I rented this through Amazon Instant Video. I adore Sherlock Holmes, the character, and adore Jeremy Brett's interpretation of Sherlock. I wanted to learn how the deductive reasoning came about. This narrator fellow fills 70 minutes with an odd music and bizarre video show with repetitious boring dialog. I ended up closing my eyes and waiting hear something new. Somehow he decides that Doyle was conflicted by religion, mysticism and reason. I am sure there are written biographies that are worth the time to read. Never mind the cost of renting the video, just a waste of time. I rate ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" higher."
3,Fascinating Documentary about Sherlock Holmes!,A cold chilling look into the theory & and logic of the occult realm. It will show you how truth is sometimes stranger than fiction. The Worlds most famous detective superstore.
2,Bad copy of DVD,"This seemed more like a music video and pictography than a documentary. I have long been a Sherlock Holmes fan but this falls short of giving any real information about ACD. There is not much here that a long-time fan would not already know. My DVD copy was fine for the first 30 minutes, then it became jumpy and scratchy, and started skipping in some places. If you are really curious about this one, rent it first. You'll have wasted less money if you find you don't like it."
3,Arthur Conan Doyle was more than Sherlock Holmes,"How did theosophy, Catholicism, and the paranormal influence the life and livelihood of Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle? What do Holmes and James Bond have in common? Who was Dr. Watson? This documentary combines contemporary videography and classic photo and film images to illuminate the life of the father of one of the world's most famous detectives."
4,"Sheryl, an African American, discovers her true identity","Sheryl is a young black girl, living in New York City, with dreams of being a fly girl in high school. Her chance comes when she visits her moms' parents in North Carolina, the south. The freedom to explore her new identity is bound by the harsh reality of racism she now faces. This new education in life connects Sheryl with her Uncle Pete, a freedom rider. Yet, his untimely death, in search of freedom, causes her to question her direction in life and the impact of Uncle Pete on her life. This questioning leads to a new lease on life and a solid resolve to make a difference. This book is an excellent lead in for Black history month. The author presents sensitive issues with a touch of grace."
3,Freedom Songs,"This book is about a 14-year-old girl, Sheryl, whose family decides to go ""down South"" for Easter. She learns two very important lessons. She learns that the smallest things in life are sometimes the most important and that you can defend yourself against discrimination without using violence.I liked this book because it shows you the struggles an African-American had to go through in the 1960's."
1,Save Your Money,"This book unfortunately is an inferior reproduction of a genuinely valuable book by Cheiro. It appears to have been xeroxed then mass printed. The reproduction is so bad that the photographed palm prints given as crucial examples at the end of the book cannot be read because they came out black rendering the lines of the palm invisible. The information Cheiro has to give is truly important. He was THE premiere palmist of the late 19th and early 20th century and what he has to say is extremely important to anyone interested in palmistry. This book however, because of its poor reproduction, is worthless. Try to find a better reproduction or investigate auction sites for an original copy."
3,Good but ...too much paper for little text,"Yes, there are 296 pages including the blank ones. though the book brings valuable information about hand reading, the price is too high for a xeroxed copy. But if you don't mind that and you are seriously involved in learning hand reading it is OK.I am happy anyway, the information here will let you know accurately the past, present and future, health state and much more.Good Luck"
4,Fun read,Mr. Brewster weaves a great tale of a man whose life completely falls apart. Its written very well and moves along nicely. I finished the book in a matter of hours.
4,Incredible,"That this game came with a Save feature was a wonderful bonus, as well as being able to play as Sonic, Tails, or both (Tail's levitation abilities with his tail come in rather handy sometimes) and the graphics for this one are just beautiful. The variety of bonus levels (3 different ones) are enjoyable, and the Chaos Emerald bonus levels are uniquely challenging. The save makes it nice, since you can go back and try at more chances for Chaos Emeralds if you beat the game without getting all 7)I would have given it 5 stars, but at only 6 levels, this game doesn't feel complete. Only with the addition of the Sonic and Knuckles cartridge does the game then feel complete (with a total of 12 levels, and a new set of Emerald bonus levels to try to win Super Emeralds) With the S and K addition, the game then merits 5 stars."
5,Sonic the Hedgehog 3,"Hold on to your pants game players you don't want to miss Sonic pass by. In this adventure we meet Knuckles an Enchidna who beliefs your after his Chaos Emeralds.To defeat you he teams up with the evil Dr.Eggman(Dr.Robotnik).In this game the levels are much longer and need skill to be passed.Collect rings and get special ""enviorment bubbles"" to help you on your way.Grab onto your control pads this game is like a Twister.MEMO MenaOXNARD,California12-21-04"
5,A really good game,"I think sonic 3 is a really good game. Really, even better if you plug it into sonic and knuckles. I like using tails best because he can fly. This enables you to nab a few more extra lives that are too high for sonic to reach. Knuckles is cool, but I've noticed that he cant jump as high as sonic. Super sonic is the best, as he can travel extremely fast and is invunerable to enemies. My friends told me I was lying when I said you could get super knuckles, but get 50 rings and 7 chaos emeralds with knuckles and you will be suprised. Super knuckles makes the screen shake when he flies into walls! This destroys all enemies on the screen (except bosses.)Tip:Get all the rings on the special stage for a massive point bonus!"
3,NOT AS GOOD AS OTHER SONIC TITLES,"Sonic The Hedgehog 3 is an average game. First off this game does keep the same winning formula fans of Sonic love,cool level design,a sense of speed,and tons of secrets. I have to say my favorite Sonic game is Sonic CD a Sega CD exclusive and Sonic The Hedgehog 2 is my second favorite. Sonic 3 isn't bad its just not as good as the Sonic titles I mentioned above."
3,"Alright, it was great the first time, but...","Why did the people at sega have to copy Sonic 2 to make money? I was really hoping for a great game when I played this right after finishing Sonic 2, but, to my dismay, I found almost no difference between it and Sonic 3.The mini games are okay, but insanely difficult and pointless and the regular game play makes it seem to be just an expansion on to Sonic 2. While it featured some new power ups, these were not enough to make Sonic 3 a great game over it's predicessor, which I found to be one of the best 2D platform games ever.I found this game to be a complete waste of my time, since, after all, I'd already just finished it's twin, Sonic 2."
3,not that great of a game,"its an okay of a game ,great if you are a collector,i like sonic 2 better though"
4,"A good game, a little short though.","This game has great graphics, for a genisis game that is. You should play as tails first to get through the game, then play as sonic for the extra challenge. Although the levels are fun, there aren't enough of them, so I suggest buying Sonic3 and Knuckles, if you can. Either way, it's a great game."
5,I love it!,"The only time I have ever played NES or SNES,was when I was at a friends house. And I was playing Mario games. So how do I know about STH 3? Sonic Mega Collection and Computer. This is my most favourite Sonic game and it still is is. You can play as Sonic and Tails (I wound not reccomend),Sonic (definate no no) or Tails (definate yes yes) This game is flooded with action and the graphics are great. My favourite thing about this game is that the backround is sooooooooo cool. I'd reccomend it"
5,The 3rd in the series...,"but 1st in the ranking! I love this game! I play it all the time!Anyway, about the game...I like the storyline a lot, but it's still very similar to the previous games. Get the Chaos Emeralds, stop Robotnik from wreaking havoc on the world. This game has very detailed backgrounds and challenging bosses, unique music and 3 new shields, and much, much more!Another thing I like is that even though it's on the 16-bit Sega Genesis, it still has that 3D look to it that is pretty darn cool! Plus my favorite character debuts in it: Knuckles the Echidna. He's so cool! If you ever get Sonic and Knuckles, put them together and something even cooler will happen! (especially if you beat the game of Sonic 3 with the Sonic and Knuckles cartrige!)My recommendation: buy this game! You won't regret it!~Amy Rose~"
4,"1,2,3 all r great.","The first 2 are 5 star. This one would be. With cool levels and lots of bosses to fight... not enough levels and the final boss really isn't to hard. Other than that... I recomened it to any sonic-fan or, Pac-man fan. (No really.)"
5,"The Game is just like Super Mario World, and MegaMan X","Greatest Music and Character is other, in 1994 Sonic the Hedeghog 3 was in Store, but anything is just like MegaMan X and the Super Mario World. get 2 Game in your Super Nintendo is greatest cool Sereis and music, and more, but it not good as Super Mario World and MegaMan X, they are cool and Big game in the World of Video game, you will play it just liek Super Mario World and MegaMan X is Better you play it easy?"
2,Sonic the Hedgehog 3,"What happened? This game is horrible. Sega really dropped the ball on this one. Get Sonic 1, 2, Spinball, or heck, even Sonic 3d Blast. Just avoid this one. Oh, & yes, I do know my Sonic stuff. I have both Adventure Dreamcast games & have played pretty much all the Sonic games."
5,Perfect,"I bought this along with the front set by National. I am very pleased with the fit and ease of installation of the fender tips, not to mention the beautiful chrome finish. These are the real deal! Heavy cast metal instead of cheap plastic! Highly recommend."
1,Can't review something I never received.,"After waiting weeks and weeks, I finally cancelled this order. The purpose for which I intended to use it (background music at an Egyptian museum exhibit) no longer existed."
5,Excellent laptop.,"Excellent laptop. Sony support has been tops. Very solid computer. Worked perfectly in heavy use for over a year. Got 2 more. Highly recommended. Much better hardware reliability and better support in my experience with Compaq, Toshiba, Dell, etc."
4,early days review,"Bought this 3 months ago at Ace hardware for $70. Easy install. So far it works great. Smooth operating.Spout height is 9.5 in from deck to aerator. The aerator swivels right or left. So you don't have to even move the spout from the center of the sink if you don't want to. No more jockeying around with big/awkward pans etc. I love it!So far. Time will tell.It replaced a disaster of a single handle Delta 440 that snapped from the deck, leaked from the handle etc.The Delta was a looser from the get with it's overly complicated installation. The handle & spout were never smooth operating and wore out in two years. Plus the aerator never properly aerated.My parents bought a delta for their bathroom and in under a years time the chrome finish has turning blotchy white.My Moen is 30 yrs old and shiny as new. Never buy delta.Will it remain leak free and smooth operating? Will the finish remain untarnished?If I run into any troubles hopefully I'll remember to update my review."
5,drum primer,"excellant review of strengthening practices for finger, hand and wrist. Nothing new, older book, but man what a value for an aspiring percussionist!"
3,Well... it is information you may be able to use...,"... but it is presented in less than ""standard"" form, so is not so simple to follow. It would have been nice to have it updated, graphically, to more contemporary notation form.The information here is contained elsewhere in more accessible form. And regardless of the author's credentials, any instructional material that is difficult to deal with fails in its purpose.While this doesn't completely fail, because it is unconventional - not updated, as mentioned above, it does not succeed to the degree it once may have in the time it was originally presented."
2,Hand-written notation hard to read,"I'm not commenting on the content, but this is hand-written musical notation that looks like it has been through a few generations or recopying. It looks sloppy, and when you are taxing your brain trying to learn exercises, you shouldn't have to worry about reading muddy and blurry print the publisher was too lazy to spend a couple hundred bucks to transcribe into sharp, readable text. My ""62nd printing"" looks like it has been through a photocopier about that many times."
3,OSTER QUESADILLA MAKER,"I LIKE THIS MAKER, SATISFIED WITH THE PROCE/ HOWEVER, MY FOOD HASN'T STOPPED STICKING IN IT YET. I HOPE IT STOPS STICKING VERY SOON."
2,Quesadilla maker too small,"Before I purchased this item, I compared it to the Salton Santa Fe quesadilla maker and decided on this one, but now I'm not sure I made the correct decision. According to the reviews I read on the Salton Santa Fe model, the plastic lid is flimsy and breaks easily when applying pressure on the lid to close it with a full quesadilla. The case on the Oster is sturdy, but it only measures 6.5"" across. The Salton is 12"" across. Almost twice as big and the Salton is also less expensive. We've decided that instead of making one quesadilla and sharing it, we'll make one for each person dining. Still, this could have been larger."
2,+1 for Too Small,"I've always had quesadillas made from fairly large tortillas. This does not hold anything larger than 6-7 inches. We also prefer to use the frozen, uncooked tortillas you can get at Costco - they are fantastic. They don't fit. Not sure why it had to be so small."
4,Great little gadget,"I've used it to make quesadillas (used the flour tortillas and brushed them with butter), omelets and to reheat cold pizza (the pizza tasted almost as good as fresh again) and it worked great. The only drawback is, it makes some weird burnt smell I use it (I've only used it a few times since I just bought it recently) and I could taste it a little bit on the food. The smell reminds me of burnt rubber or some sort but I did notice that it didn't smell as strong the last time I used it, so hopefully it'll go away overtime. Other than that, I still really like it."
4,Easy to use,"Bought this for my kids to make snacks and it's so easy for them to use! Sounds silly, but it didn't include instructions on how to make the quesadillas! We used common sense and they turned out wonderful, but some ideas would have been even better. Still, we highly recommend this maker!"
4,Nice Book,"This book would nicely compliment an introductory meteorology course, but could be used as a tutorial for the weather hobbyist. Very good explainations for Skew-T Log(p) charts and soundings."
5,severe weather flying,"This is a must read book for any pilot who does serious weather flying. Dennis takes the mumbo jumbo and puts it in terms that are very easy to understand. With thirty two years of flying under my belt, this is the only book that makes practical sense of very technical issues."
5,Great book.,"If you're going to do any serious weather flying, then Dennis Newton's book will provide a lot of great insights for you, and in a very easy-to-read manner. Coupled with the legendary ""Weather Flying"" book by Buck, these 2 books are the core of my weather flying philosophy and help me to optimize flight performance and safety."
4,Talks about nasty weather in a simple way.,"This book is for the weather novice who doesn't want to get a PhD in meteorology, but still wants to stay out of trouble. While most of the information about thunderstorms is available elsewhere, his section on icing was particularly valuable. I would recommend this to any pilot who seems lost about weather reports or charts. If you know your way around surface analysis charts and lifted index charts then this book might be too simple for you."
5,i think it is great onhow he expresses the ways of life.,"He really understands the world, unlike a few people i know. i gave him 5 stars because it is a great song and a love it very much. I am trying to purchase this cd somewhere, but i have been out of luck most of the time"
5,Excellent!,"This and its companion volume are my favorite versions of these symphonies. Great performances, historical instruments, fantastic recorded sound. A shame Hickox died so young. He was one of the great English conductors of this generation, and was proving to be a fabulous Haydn conductor as well."
4,THIS IS A GREAT COLLECTABLE,"l like the concept, as a collectable, that it looks cool, to display, not really an ""action"" figure l'd give a child to play with."
2,Underwhelming,"Toys were much smaller than expected for high price. Fairly good detail, not very sturdy - putting the pieces together puts a significant amount of strain on some parts, and I'm not confident that the toys will last very long. If I had to do it again, there's no way I would buy this - terrible value for the money."
5,Even Enjoyed By Metallica Fans!,"The book wasn't a literary masterpiece, but it did more then it had to to make an enjoyable book. I'm a huge Metallica fan and one of my friends really likes DMB. I figured I'd give the book a try (and hate it), but I thought the book was a great overview of DMB. I would defenitely recommend it!"
4,An informative look into DMB,"I'm usually hesitant to read books about bands, as there are many and they are often not very good. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Mr. Martell had taken the time to research the band well and to communicate with the fans. The images in the book only highlight the story that Martell careful outlined for the reader. I look forward to more from this author."
3,Great for the new DMB Groupie,"This book is a great book for the fan that has recently become enchanted with the unique and exquisite sound of the Dave Matthews Band. It includes biographies on the entire band, including the story of how they all came together. Find out how Dave, a native of S. America, moved to the U.S. permenately after being served papers to join the S. African army. The back of the book is the most useful, listing every album, every gig, and also micellaneous covers that the band has played throughout the years. The only down-side to this book is its redundancy. Throughout the chapters, every song is listed with it's length in time. Basically, every chapter reads like the last. On the positive, the book gives the stories behind nearly ever song. A must have for the TRUE DMB fan."
1,"Informative, yet poorly written","I found this book on the most part, informative, but the writing sytles of Nevin Martell caused the book's information to be scatter and poorly organized. Thus making the book extremely less worthwhile than it could of been. The best part of the book was the setlists, complete cover song list, and the favorite bootlegs of the author. These reasons alone are not enough to purchase the book, as the setlists can be found on the DMB webpage, and bootleg favorites are best left up to the individual, and their personal taste."
1,Smack the author of this book upside the head,"_I_ could have done a better job. This book had several mistakes (One particularly obvious one, if you trouble to glance at a picture of Dave. Blue eyes? Brown hair? Please.), the style wasn't altogether engaging and how many people actually care about the cover band? The lead singer of which, by the way, does NOT resemble Dave Matthews. I cannot believe he put a picture of them in there. Speaking of which, at least the pictures could have been of better quality. Plus, the layout wasn't exactly balanced. It's so maddening to see this kind of thing! Such simple little stuff in presentation and obvious errors in description. Songs that were mentioned in the book left off of the lists in the back to boot. Come on. Ever hear of proof-reading? Honestly, I do think I should try my luck at this. God knows it could not be any worse."
3,A look into the life of the DMB,"An exciting look into the DMB, this book seems to be almost a Cliffs Notes version of another recently released book, ""Dave Matthews Band: Step Into The Light"". While having a few unique facts here and there that make the book a keeper, the majority of it is a look at where the band came from, very in-depth looks at their albums, and has a nice set of DMB pictures."
1,No new information here,This book is simply a rehash of every interview Dave Matthews has ever done. No new quotes or information. The author simply visited the plethora of DMB web sites and condenses the information. Boo.
2,Trying to make a quick buck or just poorly researched?,"While I am a huge fan of DMB and most everything that has to do with one of the most talented bands in the world today, this book was not a typical DMB experience. There were many mistakes in the book and it offered very little new material from the well written ""Step Into The Light"" by Morgan Delancey. I hope this author was not after a quick buck from the extremely succesful DMB"
2,Shotty Job!,"The book presents false information...like the Kronos Quartet playing on ""Spoon"" no (just one of many). It seemingly borrows from ""Step into the Light"" without conscious and then even fails to give credit to the author. ""Step into the Light"" offers a careful thorough history of the band and the major players without rushing through like ""Music for the People"" does. The pace is rushed and glosses over most of the other band members other than Dave and those that were there in the beginning (Peter Greisar). For those info hungry fanatics the book will leave a lot to be desired with a handful of NEW tidbits...unfortunately that information is undermined by the misinformation in the book and the reader is left wondering if it is actually correct at all. Chances are you will find something of interest here but ""Step into the Light"" is for the not-so-casual fan. Casual is just what Martell seems to be."
2,To many mistakes,"There are to many mistakes in this book. If a person does not know alot about the band they will be mislead. Although these look to be editing mistakes. I don't know how they can miss the wrong song that the band won a grammy for. I also think that the book fails to go into things as much as it should. I am also compareing it to my only other option, ""Step Into The Light"" by Morgan Delancy, But the book does give a good history. I would not recommend it. I would however recommend the Delancy book if You want a good solid history."
4,Explicit Information!,"I am writing this review from Boston, MA. My Boyfriend is a true fan to say the least of the DMB! He is the same age as Dave and they have alot of the same background. When I stummbled upon Nevin Martell's book ""Music For The People""I wanted to read it before passing it along to my boyfriend to see how it was. It was fabulous. It had explicit information in it from where you could purchase boot leg CD's (which my boyfriend was thrilled about, e-mail address's, fantastic pictures, jokes, stories about each of the band members, and so on. It was filled with such excitement and enthusiasm, it made my boyfriend feel more in tune with the DMB! Thank you Nevin Martell for a FAB BOOK! Keep writing.... If any one out there is reading this and you have interesting information on the DMB (like were he is playing next and his latest music, etc. I would love a response...."
5,Great Band Biography for DMB Fans,"This is an extremely informative book on the bands history and their evolution from their beginnings in Charlottesville to about 2004.... It's the most up-to-date book out there right now on DMB. It's full of facts and references to song lyrics. It gives some pretty good insights into the minds of Dave and the rest of the band members. I found myself skipping from section to section rather than reading it straight through. All in all for any serious fans who like the history behind the band and the music, I would say this is a must have!!!"
4,"Dave Matthews Band ""Music for the People"" - A Great Book about a Great Band!!!!","This is a very good book, that covers the history and story of the Dave Matthews band. It covers how the members got together to form the band. It covers their music, up through the album cd ""Busted Stuff"" and the ""Central Park Concert"". It contains a discography up through the Cd ""Busted Stuff"", and ""The Central Park"" concert. It covers solo projects, and the Dave Matthews & Tim Reynolds projects. Plus, it has a Gigography, that covers all their shows up through the ""Central Park"" concert project, and also a few gigs in 2004. This is a very good book,that covers a lot of details about the band that you'd never find elsewhere."
1,Horrible Book,"Being a fan of The Dave Matthews Band, I purchased this book hoping to find out more insight to the backgound about the band. I was surprised to find many inaccuracies. One would think that they would check the facts before pulishing it. If you want accurate information of the Dave Matthews Band than I would suggest you read ""Step Into the Light""."
1,WOW is this book BAD,"From front to back this book just plain isn't good. If you were hooked in by the blurb on the front that says ""with interviews and never-before-published photos of the band's legendary live performances"" then I have much empathy for you. Nevin Martell could have taken a lot more time in writing this book. It appears that he just looked up things on the internet or looked at some old magazine interviews to fill the book. Martel was very repatitioius in his writing and every now and then he throws in a big word to try and look like he know's somthing. If he does know anything it isnt about The Dave Matthews Band. Look elsewere for a good book on this extraordinary band."
1,thin.,"The only thing one must know before reading this book: The author was a ""journalist"" for High Times. Research? Who needs it! Just separate the stems and seeds and get to typing!!"
1,Don't do it!!,"I know whenever i see something about DMB i get all giddy at my new found opportunity to learn more about the band. But let me tell you, i would be much better off if I'd skipped this ""opportunity."" ""Music for the People"" is a weak combination of recycled information and average writing skills. It's only redeeming factor is the gigography, listing all of DMB's shows, in the back section of the book. Save your money for the next time DMB tours... don't waste it on this book. If you're dead set on reading something regarding DMB, I'd go with ""Step Into the Light"" by Morgan Delancey."
3,Painful to listen to if you like Mahavishnu like me,"Painfully long renditions of the originals that used to be crisp and exciting, but this recording is over the top with drawn out preludes and redundant solos. This recording is a fine tribute, but leaves me wanting to listen to the original band."
3,Just skip 'Eternity's Breath'!,"I am surprised by the rave reviews here. While the instrumental performances are excellent, and the band the delivers what other reviewers have described, the off-key vocals on the opening track, 'Eternity's Breath', are excruciatingly bad. Intolerable, and unforgivable. You'll be happier with your purchase of this recording if you simply skip track one."
4,Great Heel For the Money,"I was able to dance and walk around in these shoes for hours. No heel is 100% comfortable, but this was one of most comfortable I have ever worn. Only gave it 4 stars because I did have to slip them off in the car on the ride home!"
2,What is the use of logic anyway?,"On the back of his book, Mr. Comfort promises to absolutely, scientifically, and without reference to faith or the Bible prove that God exists. He then goes on to extensively quote the Bible, while referring to faith and failing to employ science in his arguments. I guess the saying; ""You can't judge a book by its cover"" pertains to the back cover as well.Recently, I had a conversation with a college student who was upset because he was required to take so many ""useless"" general education courses, such as History and Introducttion to Logic and Formal Reasoning.At the time, I hadn't yet read this book. If I had, I could have used it and the quasi-arguments Mr. Comfort uses as examples of the type of rhetoric that a general education is designed to protect us from.Although this book is not a convincing argument in support of atheism, it is clearly an embarrassment to fundamentalism (which is no small task)."
1,An insult to my intelligence (which is low).,"This book is a poorly written jumble of anecdotes and simplistic arguments. The author regulary makes a claim and then does not put forward any supporting evidence. I gave up reading the book after documenting the numerous errors, blinkered thinking, fallacious arguments etc. He will have to try a LOT harder in order to convince me that his particuar god exists.This book is a valuable tool for those who wish to find out how NOT to put forward a cogent argument.Alan Liefting"
1,It's so bad that it's funny,"I'm not going to rag on his beliefs. He's entitled to believe what he wants. i am going to laugh at his terrible writing that is so bad it's good. It's a textbook example of logical fallacies combined with some of the most hilarious strawman arguments ever created. The scary thing for me is that there are people too stupid to see how bad his arguments are. I have had people repeat principles from this book and completely unable to comprehend the holes no matter how simple you break down the flaws. Oddly, at best he makes a compelling argument for agnosticism. by his argument, I have to believe there is a Santa Clause because i have never been in the basement of the taj mahal to confirm him and his elves are not hiding there."
1,Ray doesn't believe in Logic,"The God debate has always interested me, and I stumbled upon Ray's poor performance on Youtube debating the Rational Response Squad. I found this book equally sad and morbidly fascinating. The author seems to simply pull ""science facts"" off creationist websites, and I don't think he's studied any science for 40 years or so. He seems oblivious of modern fossils such as Tiktalik and Acanthostega.His circular reasoning makes my eyes burn."
5,This is awesome!!!,"This book is so awesome!!! I recomend this to everyone, Christians and atheist alike. This book will change the heart of an atheist or make a Christian's heart stronger. It has a lot of great facts and Mr. Comfort presents all of it in a simple way and sometimes he is very humorous when stating his logic. This was a book that I could not put down, I read the entire thing in one sitting."
4,Atheists are emotional (not a shock) at this book and about everything.,"David David David, don't be so bittern.Maybe one day you will understand that to prove God doesn't exist you would have to know everything. Quit being emotional David ! Use your common sense.Oh wait, so you think faith in God is ""emotional""? Well my friend, it is exactly the other way around.Let's put it like this.-If I am wrong and the atheist emotional thinking will be proven right when I die, nothing happens and I cease to exist.-If you are wrong and the logical thinking will be proven right when I die, I will be able to be with Christ again and you will be judged accordingly.Only you can lose on your emotional religion (atheism is a religion, you believe that you don't believe, but that's belief in itself already. Note the glaring contradiction) so I advise you to wake up and quit ""monkeying"" around :P.Evolved from monkeys my ass :D"
3,3 simple questions!,"Hello to everybody! Independently of the book, I have 3 simple questions you could ask yourselves. How was life created, what is it and where does it come from? I am an MD and as as very few people, I have the privilege of understanding how our body works and how unbelievable it's machinery is. I can't find 1 thing in the whole world created by a human that works one tenth as good as your body and mind do. The life in your body struggles everyday to perform all the functions you don't even think about and to actually keep you alive. So my answer to the questions is: Life could have only been created by a superior being, God. It is part of himself and comes from him. I thnik we are just microscopic parts of God that are supposed to eventually reunite with this bigger source of Life in the end. Maybe the whole process is meant just to bring back the good tiny parts and get rid of the contaminating ones..? I hope you got a little perspective of what I think."
1,God Does Believe in the Easter Bunny,"This was well written considering the majority audience's education level. I didn't read the whole thing just fingered through it at Borders. I couldn't help myself after reading the title. Any Atheist would say ""I agree"" ""jehovah/yahweh"", Santa, the Easter Bunny, Zeus, Sun gods, or any other figment of simple minded sheep need for understanding don't believe in Atheists, seeing as they DON'T EXIST."
1,"In summary, it's [not good].","Throughout the entirety of this book, the author uses forms of fallacy: the slippery slope, the straw man, circular logic; as if that weren't bad enough, he always speaks of the ""proof of the Creator"" that he gave or will give, when, in reality, that ""proof"" is just as faulty and intangible as everything else.He claims on the book cover that he doesn't use the Bible or his religion to prove anything, but this is clearly a lie; he constanttly uses the same cliche's any Bible-Belted person has ever heard...."
2,Beautiful but poor craftsmanship,"This case is beautiful, but the back of my case started to crumble almost immediately. It started cracking, and then little pieces fell off. I had to take the case off because it became ugly."
2,A little small,This case is a little small for my phone. But it is sturdy and the attractive. I wish it was a little more flexible.
5,A Definite Classic,"George Shearing never disappoints you and on this album he added the fabulous Dakota Staton to give us one classic jazz recording. Shearing and his quintet supply top notch jazz standards such as 'Pawn Ticket' and 'Bags Groove' to name just two. Then intermingled with this already fabulous music are the lovely vocals of Dakota singing such tunes as 'In The Night', 'The Late, Late Show' and 'I'd Love To Make Love To You' again to name a few. This is a not to be missed classic for ANY collection of jazz lover."
3,Solid but not ground-breaking,This book is a solid text that provides a good range of the basics about managing a CI effort. The authors know their material well and present it in painstaking detail (too much?) in places. The book doesn't read easily and actually flows more like an elaborate outline than a well-written story.This will benefit those new to managing CI units and might even be of some help to those with a few more years in the field. I doubt it will break new ground for experienced CI managers. It is likely to be of at least some value to most readers interested in the field.
4,Bad man? Pretty Good!,"They had grown up together -- the gunslinger and the banker's wife. Now they were at a crossroads. An innocent man was going to hang for something that had happened long ago in a dusty barn on the edge of the prairie. Al Cobb never claimed to be an honorable man, but he chose to go to the gallows keeping a secret that could have saved his life, all to protect a woman he couldn't have. The law had done its duty, so why would the most influential man on the frontier want to rush Cobb's execution?"
3,Plate stand,Arrived as expected. Stand doesn't work well with plates that have a curved edge. Not too sturdy.
5,Evans slippers,Item delivered promptly. Have worn this style of Evans slipper for many years. Product was new and as described.
2,do over,"One of the pair turned out to be a lemon, i.e. unsatisfactory. Part of the sole substance does not stay where it belongs & moves towards the toe, which provides for an uncomfortable feeling. With effort it can be shifted back, but soon will return to its unfavorable position. My previous pair were identical in style, but purchased from a different company [unfortunately going out of business] & they were wonderful slippers."
3,"pretty good, but a quality control problem","These are good slippers but for a quality control problem. On one of the two slippers the bottom pulls up when I take it off. Not completely out of the slipper, but it's a pain."
3,Quality OK,"As all the other reviewers chief complaint is the liner lifting up, that is only problem with these comfy slippers that my hubby loves. Hard to find 3E size. He powders them when he takes them off to try to keep liner in place. Too bad LB Evans cannot improve liner for the price of slippers."
4,LB Evans Opera Slippers,"I had a pair of these ""Opera Slippers"" that I bought locally. I have very narrow feet, so when the first pair wore out, I looked on line, to see if I could find them in my size. The good news, is that Amazon had them. The less than good news, was that they were a little snug in the toes(something I have RARELY had a problem with, wearing a 12AA shoe). Being slippers, it didn't take long for them to ""break in"", and now I where them all the time. I've worn them outside a few times, but I wouldn't recommend it, as they have a real soft sole, which is how I wore out the last pair I had. Overall, I will buy this item again, and recommend it to others, as well."
2,HAVE HAD BETTER FROM EVANS,TWO MONTHS OLD TOPS ARE COMING OFF.DIDN/T SAVE THE RECEIPT !!!!!TRYING TO CONTACT EVANS ON EMAILBUT NO LUCK THERE.
3,SIGN OF THE TIMES,"""Leave him, you'll be better off. Find yourself, kid.""""I don't know where to look."""
3,Summer Sisters was Better,"Read Wifey in one sitting...I agree it was easy to read and flowing, but what did the guy on the motorcycle have to do with it all? It is a catchy beginning, but the motorcycle guy and the phone caller never tied in with the rest of the story.Judy Blume has a great writing ability because I hated the husband by the end of the book. Buy it used!"
2,Disappointed,"When I first started this book, I was anxious to see what happened next; but it eventually got to be monotonous and somewhat repetitive as far as the plot goes. It was an easy read. I am disappointed that I paid $12.99 for such a short, easy to read, disappointing book. All in all, I feel like this book really didn't go anywhere... In my opinion, the ending was fairly abrupt and left you wondering what was going to happen. In fact, I checked more than once to make sure I really was on the last page."
3,Desperate Housewife,"My reaction while reading:If you want to learn more about the 60s/70s from the perspective of a priviledged white female, this is the book for you! I could barely finish it because the characters & situations were annoying and unbelievable.However, after I finished the book I started thinking about why this book was so unsatisfying/irritating. I concluded that perhaps the book was *too* realistic. It showed how frustrating life can be and that it doesn't wrap up nicely in the end, we just keep moving on. It's easy to say that this book is ""dated"" since it was published in the 70s, but quiet desperation is still a reality for many people, male or female."
2,Twinkies for the brain! 90210 in print!! Lots of sex!,"I bought this after reading Summer Sisters (highly recommend Summer Sisters as one of my favorite books -- a surprise as I'm a top seller fiction reader -- grisham, koontz, patterson) -- this book was a 4 hour read through will little to no character development -- lots of sex, but even that was a bit dull as it was meaningless -- I would equate this to watching 902 or a sunday night movie -- a quick way to pass the time but not too engrossing -- i'm just glad i bought it in softcover --"
5,Absolutely Fabulous!,"This book is funny, sad, thought-provoking and relentlessly readable. The way everything comes together in the end is amazing."
2,depressing!!,"I loved Judy Blume's adult novel 'Summer Sisters' so I was excited to read 'Wifey'. I was so disappointed, the book left me feeling completely depressed and unsatisfied! The husband is a complete jerk and the wife is such a pushover. I wanted to hear about her triumph over her dominating husband, but instead it was a story of female submission and never-ending heartache.Would not recommend if you're looking for a light, enjoyable read!"
1,Not worth the time,"There are so many other great books out there. As a woman, I did not identify with this repressed, depressing character at all. The dialogue drags on pointlessly sometimes and the writing is unpoetic. If you are in the mood for a brainless read for a plane ride, this would be it."
3,"Interesting, Never Dull Moments","I enjoyed this book. A lot of the situations that arise in this characters life leave me a bit angered towards her and some of the people around her, but I could not put the book down till it was done.The ending left me with my mouth hanging down to the ground."
2,Anti-Climatic,"This is kind of a boring book, maybe it was scandalous for its time, but its not now. The main character is a push-over and I felt that the sex scenes were almost disturbing because of her attitude :/ While reading I thought that it would be just boring at first, setting the scene and giving background info about the character but the whole book was like that pretty much. The ending is pretty bad too, in the way that when I got to the ending, I had NO idea I was at the ending! I would say check this out at the library if you are curious like I was and want to give it a try, or get the paperback so you can sell it back, because this book was not worth the $12.99 for the kindle in my opinion and I wish I could get my money back."
1,just awful,"this was the most frustrating and annoying book i have ever read. the main character was such a sap it was painful to read about her exploits. the back of the book made it seem like she went out on sexual adventures when in actuality she either fell into the situation or didn't have enough of a backbone to get out of it. It was just agitating to read about a woman who couldn't think for herself and was walked all over by her husband. the only reason i can think you might want to buy this book is to skim it and only read the dirty parts otherwise, forget it."
3,Different,I surprised myself at how disappointed I was in this book. This book I found the dialogue somewhat stale and beyond. I think the books Judy Blume writes for children through the teen years well written and easy to follow. Wifey I found to be trashy.
2,Pass on this one,"Judy Blume needs to stick to her teenage books. I grew up reading her books and loved them! Therefore, I thought since I was now an adult I would start reading her books again and this time her adult stories. I'm very disappointed. There is nothing exciting about this story...at all! The ending is blah...when I finished I realized I just wasted my time reading it. Definately pass on this one!"
1,Can I Give No Stars?,"I wrote a review of this book before but it never showed up. Probably because I used so many four letter words the editors blew it up. I will try to accomplish the same thing this time with proper language.This book is an insult to women. I didn't find it funny, amusing or entertaining. I am a police officer who has fought for the right of women to live in a violence free environment for over 15 years. Wifey sets us back 20. How can an author like Blume who I read to my kids and still laugh about write such a meaningless degrading volume?Send me an E-mail and I'll send you my copy post paid. Oh, I forgot, don't bother I threw it out."
1,trash it,"Got it for a penny, read the first chapter, then threw it away. Sorry I can't give a review on the whole thing, but it wasn't worth my valuable time."
3,An okay Blume read.,"I was a bit disappointed in this story. It had all the Blume characteristics, lots of sex, interesting characters, but for some reason, this book did not grab me as others have in the past(like Summer Sisters).Sandy is frustrated in her marriage to Norman, who is very rigid and has sex once a week and never deviates from their ""routine"". Sandy feels there must be more to life and marriage than cooking meals, raising the kids and making Norman happy. Sandy begins to come alive as she is in several sexual situations with several different men (I won't tell you who...that would give it away!)Perhaps I have outgrown the Blume story mould and was looking for a more enriching read. Overall, those who like Blume, will probably like this book."
1,Shallow,"I read ""Summer Sisters"" first and found it to be very enjoyable. I thought ""Wifey"" would be just as good. I was wrong. The characters were underdeveloped and superficial; the plot predictable and anti-climatic."
1,Reviewers Let Me Down!,"I'm baffled as to how people can give this book a 5 stars. I bought this book last week based on the positive reviews on this site. You guys let me down.I was hoping for another Summer Sisters when I purchased this book, but when I finished it occured to me that perhaps Summer Sisters was written by a ghost writer.The main character in ""Wifey"" wasn't likeable in the least. She was angry, repressed, boring, and completely irritating. As another reviewer stated, this book was filled with stereotypes and I noticed a score of political undertones.The characters lacked developement, there weren't any scenes I looked forward to, and it seemed Blume tried so hard with the sex scenes that she missed sexy and went right for slutty. I felt like I was reading about a washed-up hippie commune without the love or drugs."
3,Book review for Wifey (book club book),Wifey by Judy Blume. This book was a book club selection. Several of the women had read the book in their younger years and were disappointed with the writing and plot development by such a good writer. I found it interesting and certainly worth a read.
3,Wifey Review,"This book, at first, seems too dull and boring. You have to motivate yourself to read it. However, onece you start reading it, it keeps involving you more and more unitl finally you can't help but not put it down. Good book, not the best though. Not really one you'd want to buy. Then again, I am really not that big of a Judy Blume fan."
1,Cheap writing and almost a dull porn!,"This book was a huge dissapointment. I read ""Summer Sisters"" (also by Blume - an adult novel, too), before picking up ""Wifey"", and loved that novel. BUT, ""Wifey"" lacks substance and has these wierd side stories and dumb sex scenes. A huge let down from Blume."
5,Such an easy read!,"This is the first adult novel that I have read by Judy Blume. I was hooked from the first page; not really because of the story itself, but how it was written. Reading this book was like reading a letter from a friend; there wasn't a single paragraph that I found boring. Honestly, I felt like I was reading about myself. I laughed a lot at things that were so true to marriage. Of course, I think Judy could write about composte and make it enjoyable to read! This is a must for women that love books about women; a much better read than any romance novel."
2,"did not satisfy!!! Seattle, WA","I was excited to get this book because I like most of Judy's word. This book was a quick read, but the ending was very disapointing and I found very little depth to it. A good, quick read, but if you are looking for something to really dive into, I recommand her new book, Summer Sisters much higher than this!"
2,disappointing,"Even for casual ""guilty-pleasure"" sort of reading, this was very disappointing. I enjoyed Summer Sisters, and of course, Judy Blume bks. I read growing up. This was very depressing and I found it somewhat disgusting. I gave it 2 stars, only because I have to be honest and say it was entertaining, but in a Jerry Springer sort of way. I don't know if I should even try Smart Women....but according to someone elses review, it was better, so I'll give it shot!"
3,Glad I bought it in the Bargain bin,"The book is well-written; you develop empathy for the main character and the story moves along at a good pace, but the ending was a huge disappointment. Although I can see why the book was groundbreaking when it was published, it seems dated now. The sex scenes were rather gratitous and pathetic (yes-I realize this is the point) and a little too graphic for my taste. I have always enjoyed Blume's children's books. I'll stick with them from now on."
2,"Eh, it was okay","Okay so I was really looking forward to reading this book, considering all the wonderful reviews I had read. However, I was a little disappointed. It was an okay story, but I found it hard to follow in the beginning. It jumps back and forth from different time perionds in the main character's life. The ending, I thought, was unresolved and left you hanging. It's not a book I would go running out to buy. But if you've got nothing else to read and just want a good ""filler"" book between novels, it's a quick and easy read."
3,Read this BEFORE Summer Sisters,"I am ecstatic when it comes to Judy Blume's books! But I read Summer Sisters first, knowing that Wifey was her first adult fiction. I should have listened to my instinct. Summer Sisters was amazing, I felt that Wifey was little dry and not as good as expected from Judy Blume. OK reading, just read it before Summer Sisters."
1,"Good jam, price is rediculous","This jam is really good, but serioulsy, the price is just not right. This jam cost much, MUCH, less at Trader Joe's, I think I paid $4 for it, and the cost for shipping is really disturbing."
2,disappointing...,"This book starts out pretty good, with interesting illustrations to the concepts and ideas put forth (the milestone concept is very good), but pretty soon it becomes no more than a directed Bible study with Scriptural quotations trying to relate friendship with the church and how we all should be united. Very VERY disappointing. I was looking for some analysis of the importance of masculine friendship through an educated Christian perspective, and while some stories he uses are great, all I got was another glorified Bible study. Big let down..."
5,EXCELLENT VALUE,"My wife is an amateur bird watcher. She loves nature and has developed an interest in becoming more knowledegable about the wildlife in our area. She had a Bird Watching book but it was older and lacked pictures of the birds. I bought this book based on providing the pictures that she sought.She has had the book for a month now and uses it frequently. She is very happy with the picture quality and coverage. We live in the Chicago area. For the price, this was an EXCELLENT Value and I would recommend it to anyone."
5,If you buy one birding book - this is the one!,"I own lots of bird books, and the ones you're ""supposed"" to own - National Geographic (3rd edition), Peterson Guide to Western Birds, Sibley, Golden, and a few others. This one's my favorite, and the most practical in the field. One reviewer wrote that they prefer illustrations - I disagree. As amazing as the illustrators for other guides are, photographs just go somewhere where a drawing can't. And I do love National Geographic and Sibley, but the editions I own, by the time you've looked up the bird you're looking for, it's probably flown away. This is my favorite. That's not to say I don't think any birder should go without National Geographic or Sibley; but those two books are better for doing your homework; Kaufman beats them in the field."
5,excellent book for the birder with a little experience,"I really enjoyed the way Kaufman grouped birds together according to type. If you know your birds a little then you can just go to the type and pick which one it looks most like. Also,there were photos of the bird in it's different plumages...male, female, juvenile, winter, summer, etc. and he showed pictures of different subspecies variations. The maps and graphs were thorough and easy to understand. Kenn took much of the confusion out of birding!"
5,Beautiful pictures,I ordered two of these guides. One for me and one for a birthday gift for a friend. I like it very much.
1,Birds of North America A New Focus on the Field Kaufman,"This is not a book for beginners. You must know the type of bird you are seeing, from Cuckoos to the common sparrow, before you can identify through the differant sections. It is definately not a book for children. I am returning mine for something simpler for my grandson. Mary Anne Sutphin"
4,Did you see that bird?,"What I love about this Kaufman Field Guide to Birds of No. America is that you can quickly ""fan"" through the photos of the birds to quickly identify the one that just flew by! The photos are beautifully sized and grouped for easy identification. Great for a beginner."
5,Among the best,"This was one of the best graphic novels I have read. Watchmen beats it out but not by much. The story line goes as follows:A detective who is too dedicated to his job has his wife leave him. At a crime scene these ghastly things rip his soul from his body. Upon waking he finds himself in the in-between, where people and things that are forgotten are left. He then proceeds to follow a woman from LA to New York to reclaim his soul back. Upon this journey he encounters things that make both of them realize who they are.I am not going to ruin the ending because it is so well written and so poetic that you will have to read it for yourself to understand the full meaning of this book. The art is top notch thanks to penciler Gary Frank and the writing of J. Michael Straczynski perfect. I could see this movie being made into a movie without many modifications."
5,Greatest Comic Book Of All Time.,"Although I do not own the graphic novel, I do own all 13 (1/2 + 1-12) issues of the series and just re-read this weekend. This is more of a supernatural, thought-provoking series that has no equal in this medium. The story is very mature and focuses heavily on themes of hope, despair, morality, society, heaven, and hell. The art is very gritty but clean and easy to look at. The story is very well paced and will have you turning pages as fast as you can. The climax and ending are both suprising and well thought out; you can guess but you'll probably be wrong. And the story actually ends with sort of an epilogue. Too many stories these days, especially in comics, end with the climax and never ""really"" end the story; that is not the case with Midnight Nation.Overall, from beginning to end, Midnight Nation is the most satisfing, entertaining graphic novel/comic series ever published. I can't recommend it enough."
4,Good Irish music,"Musical tastes vary enough that I can't say ""you'll love it!"" to everyone. If you like folk music, tin whistles, low whistles, uillean pipes, nice harmonies, and Irish accents then this is a good CD for you. I bought it because I wanted a copy of the anti-war song ""Green Fields of France."" I liked the rest of the songs well enough once I'd got it that I bought copies for my parents and grandparents as well."
1,"Great book, if you already know everything there is to know","This book is probably worthwhile, if you already understand everything there is to know about shotguns. As a relatively novice shooter, I found several sections incomprehensible and several recommendations ridiculous (building my own ""gun room"" or my own ""guns only workbench"" are just going to have to wait until I win the lottery). The illustrations are small, there are no schematics of the procedures recommended, and the writing is disorganized. There has got to be something better out there."
4,useful book to keep with you,"Orvis have a reputation for fine products, and this small book is definitely one. I am no gunsmith, but do like to be able to do a quick fix on a gun in the field. Morrow manages to get across enough useful knowledge to make me feel comfortable with simple tasks, and reinforces the need to use a gunsmith for more difficult tasks."
3,Greatest Sports Rock & Jams,I'm love these old favorites and see younger generations enjoying them as well shows that good things never really go out of style and Rock & Roll is STILL here to stay!Mike
3,Interesting nuances of life in Kashmir,"A good read for second generation Kashmiri Americans. The details were of interest, since of course its a world that Kashmiri-Americans of second generation will not get a chance to see. It's the kind of book I'd like to read with a Kashmiri close at hand to find out if the details are authentic (and not catered to the audience), and the experience universal. A unique find, though, since it's unclear how many books can tackle life in Himalayan valleys from the inside. Validates that Kashmiri pandits deserve and need to contribute to their own body of literature, write their own histories rather than relinquish that right to historians."
4,Haunting and beautiful memoir,"A lovely and bittersweet memoir of Koul's life in paradise, the Kashmir region of India. It's a tale of a lost way of life in a region that has been sundered by strife, conflict, and ultimately war between India and Pakistan, Hindus and Muslims.Of especial interest is the reverence in which women of the region were held - in a country in which women are often no more than chattel. The Tiger Ladies is a book rich in sensual detail, a book people can enjoy on many levels: as travel literature, as a cultural study, for the descriptions of the food - and most of all as a loving and haunting memoir of a time and place that no longer exist."
5,A wonderful story,"Patrizia's story of finding her father and discovering herself in the process is wonderful. I finished this book in a few short hours, although I wish it was longer. The writing itself is lovely and worth the reading. A good love story, a good parental relationship story, and an enchanting portrait of Italy, I reccommend this novel very highly to readers of all tastes."
5,It's paper! Nice and bright!,No problems with this PAPER. It's just what I expected. Just about as good as any other paper I've used.
1,"Not, repeat, NOT photo paper.","Very disappointed in this order. Amazon's sale page for this item clearly states that this is ""photo"" paper. I have Matte Photo Paper in other sizes and it has a coating on the paper to absorb the ink and reduce the glare. This is just PLAIN PAPER in the large size. The photo of the item on the sale page is not a photo of what you get and the title of what you get clearly states that this is Presentation Paper NOT Photo Paper. ""Presentation"" refers to the large size, not the nature or quality of the paper.What a waste of my money and extra shipping costs to overnight this product. I want a refund!!!"
1,Warning!!!,Be careful...this is NOT photo quality glossy film as described. It is very thin paper w/ a matte finish.
1,Wimpy paper,"I guess I was expecting something that wouldn't buckle with ink. Very disappointed. As a cover sheet with no printing, sure, it's fine, but for printing on, forget it."
5,Good Paper,The item works as expected and was new and in great shape. high quallity and dependable. Would purchase this again
1,"Lousy Epson ""Photo"" Paper","NOT even close to being good inkjet paperAdvertised by Epson as ""Coated Photo"" NOTPrinting results not worthy of a low level proof :(A waste of money for photo printing,however;we did find an appropriate use for the rest of the paper;nailed to the outhouse wall..."
2,"Great size, poor weight...","This is a good, cheap matte paper - but beware, strong ink coverage cause it to buckle due to it's weight. I can't really recommend this paper for proofing, due to it's size...make sure you review the paper's weight before you purchase."
5,Gets the Job Done,"I needed photo paper to print 12x12 scrapbook pages using Creative Memories, and I can cut this paper down to work. I also used the paper to do posters for my children's school spring drama; again it worked very well. It did not bleed through to the back, but I was careful to select the right paper on my printer settings so as to avoid wasting ink and bleeding through. The finish is matte and not glossy, but if that doesn't matter to you, then this is the answer! Great, great price for such a large sized paper. Cheapest I could find!"
5,awesome,I used this product to print my college thesis which was a 140 page book. I was worried the color would not match my original artwork but luckily everything came out clean and accurate. It was a bit expensive but worth it for such high quality print outs. :)
3,NOT THE BEST SWITCH COMEDIES BUT STILL ENTERTAINING,"This premise has been used so many times it's a wonder any of these films could be worth watching. Like all of these switch comedies, they work mostly because of the stars doing what they can with the weak material. It is a funny movie, but it has been done better. Vice Versa may have come out after this,but I think it is much funnier. Girls who have a crush on ""Kirk"" probably think this is the best switch comedy,but for the rest of us, it's just OK. ;-b"
1,Worst Quality DVD ever!,"I purchased the dvd hoping to gain some knowledge about using a bokken. What I got was a lesson in bad dvd authoring. The dvd is 50 minutes long and for the first 12-15 minutes the dvd plays fine, so you get the gripping and 8 basic stances. However, at this point the dvd begins to have pixelation problems, so the 8 cuts and transitioning are barely watchable, because the dvd begins to lag and stutter and freeze up for several seconds at a time. But the worst part was at 29 minutes the dvd starts over by itself, never covering the 8 basic forms and formalities at all! I was very disappointed with the quality of the product. From what I was able to see, Mr. Abbott presented good information, but after failing to play in three different dvd players, it was a total waste of my time"
4,An interesting departure.,"I wasn't prepared for the soulful, jazz and blues-laced vocals on this album. After several listenings, though, I am enjoying the piano dominated sessions. After years of quiet, thoughtful folk, this lively departure seems forced at times. I am eager to see them on tour, and wonder what flavor will dominate."
5,Great album as always,"This CD is probably my favorite behind ""Drunkard's Prayer"". It's a fantastic mix of styles from their usual introspective and heartache ""I don't want to waste your time"" to the upbeat and fun ""I'm on a roll"" to the downright strange in ""Don't wait for Tom"" -- this is a must-have for your Over the Rhine collection."
2,SHEER DISAPPOINTMENT,WHAT HAVE THEY DONE. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE ALL THEIR OTHER CD'S. NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED HERE.I CAN ONLY HOPE THEY GO BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE. THIS IS NOT A CD I WILL LISTEN TO MUCH. WHAT A BUMMER.
1,not worth the paper it's printed on !,I bought the book because of the positive reviews (written by friends of the author ?) but found the book very boring and repetitive. I stopped reading when the author quoted a former science fiction writer turned cult leader. The back of the camel finally broke !
4,TFF Hits & Rare Tracks,"I give it 4 stars because it contains more ""B"" sides then hits, I would recommend the ""Gold"" album first & this one second. For some odd reason they left off ""Pale shelter"". They might have been wise to put that one on either in its original 7"" format (which is far different then any album version) or deleted a few ""B"" sides & added a few more great album tracks. Nevertheless, it is a nice package & could have used a third disc & liner notes with more information on ALL the tracks. Search ""Judemac Forever"" on msn."
3,Definitely dated,"This book is very dated. It covers the basics pretty well: ResourceBundles, DateFormatter, Locales, etc. However, there are several things I find disappointing about this book:1) All the examples are mostly client side Java. Even the topic of internationalizing websites spends more time on Java applets. While this is Ok, I'm guessing most i18n work in Java these days is done for web applications.2) There are better libraries/frameworks for dealing with Internationalization than the ones that come with Java: ICU4J and JodaTime to name a few. Since this book was written in 2001, these are not covered.3) This book does not cover anything related to Java 1.5."
3,"Good overview, but wished for more depth","This book does a good job of handling localization issues with respect to java applications through the use of resource bundles, and native language UIs.In my current project we are doing some very intensive XML processing with web content. Web content can be in any number of encodings and character sets, and we've had a decent number of problems when converting content from one encoding to another or from one character set to another.I was hoping that this book would give very practical hints about how to handle/avoid/rectify character set conversion issues in java. However, the only mention of converting encodings/character sets claims that if you use the proper java.io class with the proper constructor arguments, java will wave it's magic wand and all is right with the world. I can tell you for a fact this isn't true. This was a big disappointment of this book."
3,"If you are developing an internationalized site, good read","There is very limited material on Java Internationalization. If you are new to internationalization then some chapters are a good read. There is a lot of digression on different languages, how they are written, how they are different, which is good read but does not really help you write better software. I would have expected more examples."
3,"Pretty, small and dainty","I wanted something small to match a black beaded necklace. This is nothing fancy about these earrings, but small enough from a distance they look quite elegant."
1,"Quality, fit diminished","Champion has changed these sox. A couple years ago, they were marketed as ""Performance"" and they had good cushioning and fit, and an ankle collar nearly 2 inches high. Now they're ""High Performance"" and they're thinner, shorter, and the ankle collar is around a half inch. Don't expect these ""High Performance"" sox will replace the earlier, better product. Search for versions of the model CH1963, see the difference. Or just buy and wear these for what they are."
4,A classic travel adventure for young girls,"With the fabulous success of his Wizard of Oz books, L. Frank Baum finally found himself financially well off. He and his wife Maud used their new wealth to take a trip overseas. On 7 April 1906 they were witnesses to a major eruption of Vesuvius. This experience becomes the background for Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad which takes the characters to this same event and makes the novel interesting reading. Baum portrays the three young girls and their Uncle John as nationalistic Americans, extremely proud of their culture and values, who are always making comparisons with how much worse Europeans are in all they say and do. This adds humor to the story which is basically an adventure tale that centers around the mysterious men they meet in their travels. Filled with detail from Baum's own travels, the book ends up being a cautionary tale for Americans traveling abroad."
5,Cold Blood Box Set? Incomplete!,"I've always loved the band Cold Blood. I was happy when they started releasing their music on and now this Box Set, HOWEVER, I just discovered yesterday there is one more Cold Blood Recording that should be included in this Box Set. Their final recording (which made it to LP) was recorded in 1976.My buddy informed me about it and shared the files with me. It's good enough to be included and should be regardless. That's the only thing that saddens me about this Box set. bambamdrummer is my youtube name if anybody wants to discuss this further. Perhaps we can get Wounded Bird Records to release it."
5,Acappela Rock-n-Roll with Wit and Charm to Boot!,"AC Rock scores again with some beautiful acappela renditions of some current and classic rock-n-roll. Following their debut album, ""UR What UR"", this one betters the first. It's masterfully edited and wonderfully balanced with some witty performances (""Come Go With Me"" is recorded in the echoing men's room at a local restaurant) and vituoso singing. This male quartet from the northern suburbs of Chicago blends talent (their version of The Beatles ""Because"" is reason alone to get the album) and humor (check out ""Witch Doctor"") to go with some outright fun. The voices are well-balanced and it really sounds like they are enjoying themselves. If you enjoy acappela singing, add this one to your collection."
4,No Remote control !!,"These cameras have no remote control!! Body (plastic) is not durable - all doors falling off. But 350MB memory - fantastic. Very nice ""360 view"" and ""movie(15sec)"" options. Easy to operate."
1,"poor or no explanations of planes, levers, biomechanics","The title is deceiving. There are no explanations of levers, planes, moments of inertia, etc. In a nutshell, all throws are based on the principle of the moment of a couple, that is, initiating rotation about some point by applying equal and opposite forces; there is no science behind the writing in this book. There are excellent judo books which show sound principles of throws and sweeps, such as ""Street Stoppers"" and ""effective combat throws""!"
1,Do not buy - Incredibly poor physics,"This book simply adds to the confusion most people have when trying to understand physics. It is riddled with errors and perpetuates long-standing misconceptions.Possibly the worst example is the discussion of ""conservation of energy"". It is not possible to apply mechanical principles to **any** form of striking (from hitting a ball to punching someone) without taking this most important principle of physics into account. Yet the author's explanation is that this is about not getting tired in a fight.Sir Isaac Newton should come back and haunt this author. I cannot believe that anyone actually proof-read it.A very, very poor book. Actually worth zero stars"
2,"Good topic, not so good writing or organization","The topic idea is excellent and the content is fairly good. However, like many MA books, the quality of writing, editing and organization is only so-so. In a few places, it is even worse than so-so. In fact, since the book markets itself as being written by an educator and trainer, I was rather disappointed. The book could really use a lot of editorial help from somebody who has some training in technical writing for adult education.Nonetheless, it is hard to find this topic covered in the MA field, so I'd recommend it for people who want to study for a year or more in any MA field, just don't put it top on the list of books to get and wait to get it used or discount."
4,Cool Book,"Here's the deal - I've been involved in martial arts for years. I'm not the best in the world, but I'm no slouch. I practice hard, learn well, and apply what I know in class and competition.Still, I've wondered why a techniques sometimes rings like a bell but other times doesn't seem to work at all.After reading this book I've been able to fine-tune my technique to a much greater extent. I kick harder, strike more forcefully, and am much better at absorbing blows. My peers have noticed - it's not just my imagination.Plus, I've applied the concepts to improve my teaching. I can explain how and why something works in a clearer fashion. My students get better right along with me.So, why not 5 stars? Because nothing's ever perfect!"
5,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.,"This is "" Huxley's Essays on Hume and Berkeley,"" spoken about by Aleister Crowley in "" Liber OS ABYSMI vel DAATH "" -- a short paper which talks of a method to end the reason for the purpose of its replacement by higher, ultimately higher, faculties. This is an excellent treatise reviewing Hume and Berkeley in an exceedingly subtle manner. Huxley's literary style is utterly fantastic. A rare classic to come by."
1,Is this stuff dangerous??!?!?!?,"I really like the product but as the expensive material evaporates, the scent becomes less pronounce. Flipping the reeds is messy and leaves the hand covered in scent.However, this is my biggest concern: When the bottle got near the end (it lasted months), I decided to put the remaining liquid in a styrofoam cup to allow for more scent. What a mistake! When I got back to my office the next day, the cup was completely disintegrated. What a nasty mess!!!!! What the heck is in this liquid anyway!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Not that I have an allegiance to anyone, but the scents at Pier1 are much cheaper although not quite as strong (even though their product stained my furniture which the company made good on.)"
5,Way better than Abreva,"Amazon needs to bring this back; not the gel, this exact liquid. It stops cold sores dead in their tracks. As soon as you feel that little tingle, start applying this and you will never see a cold sore. If you already have one, this will heal it 5x faster than anything else on the market.Gel's only make cold sores messy and gross. This liquid dries them out and heals them quickly.AMAZON...please bring this product back!!!!"
5,Excellent Product,"I ordered the small size perch directly from the company based in Petaluma, California, as I have a smaller size cat. Having recently moved to a rented apartment I was a little worried about installation, as I did not want to create any permanent damage to the walls or sills. The design of this perch is amazingly, elegantly simple. Two tabs fit into the sill of the window and a wing nut tightens the support bar(s) against the wall. It is so easy to install and remove that I take it down every night to close the hideous vertical blinds that are standard equipment in this apartment complex, then reinstall it every morning so kitty can enjoy the morning sun. The construction is top-notch, sturdy wood covered with thick carpet. It is so much better than I expected, and even more than I had hoped for. Oh, and the cat loves it. She complains every morning until I get up and re-install it for her to enjoy."
4,Excellent Product,"My cat loves this large sized, sturdy window perch made of solid wood and nicely carpeted. Only issue was that the installation was a bit frustrating. My husband and I had to do a creative work-a-around but once we secured it, we were very pleased."
5,Great Book!,Just finished this book and found it interesting. The call by call layout of the book made it flow. A must read for any law enforcement enthusiasts.
3,Not as good as the novels,"I've read all the Reynolds novels and love them. I got this as a Christmas present and I was curious to see if someone who is very gifted at writing 700 page novels (which are really sub-parts of a 2000+ page saga) could pull off a 130 page short story. He can't. These stories read like the cliff notes version of the first 500 pages of a 700 page story...with a quick ending that doesn't resolve anything.They are entertaining to read and you won't have to waste much time, so I can't completely pan the book. But it doesn't really add any depth to the Revelation Space universe."
4,Diamond Dogs,"The short story ""Diamond Dogs"" was very captivating. I would have bought the book just for that."
2,Surprisingly disappointing,"With regards to Diamond Dogs only: Reynolds here seems to be revisiting territory that was more memorably depicted by A.J. Budrys in Rogue Moon. In a sense, Diamond Dogs represents everything wrong with science fiction, to the degree it trivializes serious and potentially very gripping issues, such as cloning, cybernetic modification of life and how it affects people (what it ultimately means to be human), for the sole convenience and purpose of serving a tiresome, shopworn alien puzzle plot. Reynolds could have gotten a longer and more gripping book just out of the dramatic issue of cybernetics: the slow 'robotification' of humans.(I can't help feeling this is why science fiction remains a genre that is dismissed as ultimately trivial.)"
4,Great product,"I've used this product for many years and it is the only one that is very effective at giving to relief to the pain of canker sores. I suggest to start using it when you first recognize that you are getting the canker sore. It will prevent the sore from getting huge and will shorten the recovery time as well. Read the instuctions well and follow them, you'll be happy with the product."
3,not good as sample,"my dentist gave me few sample sachets of zilactin-B when he saw my mouth sores. i was impressed the way it helped me to cure those mouth sores. so i ordered one .025 oz tube. but i am bit disappointed now, as it seems to be bit different than what was in sample. unlike the sample this one is not so good adhesive and also the tube is not designed so user friendly."
5,Great Windshield Wiper!,"I'm not experienced at installing windshield wipers; however, I figured it out and am very pleased with the performance. The wind resistance feature holds the blade in place nicely."
1,Will not work as described.,"Will not drain hot oil in reservoir, bought it for safety so we don't have to handle boiling oil again and the risk of accidents,We have no use for it, should have returned it.This product shoul be recalled for safety reasons."
1,Temp is never consistant,This fryer does not hold a consistant temp. Thermometer shows it does not reach temp above 280 degrees. Leaves food soggy and grease laden. Not a good investment
4,T Fal Deep Fryer,"I love the fact that it call comes apart to put in the dishwasher. I love the separate storage area for the oil. However, I am not enthused about the elements being in the oil. I find that fish tends to catch under the elements before it floats to the top. It is a little large for what I want to do but that only makes it a storage issue and one that should be taken into account. It does a great job despite my observations."
1,Oil not deep enough,"My first input ever on anything. However, this ""deep "" fryer is anything but a Deep Fryer. Oil measures about 1 1/2 inches into the basket.(at the oil max line)This depth is insufficient for deep frying chicken pieces.Frying chicken in this fryer would be like pan frying.You would have to turn the chicken over after one side/portion is cooked.The fryer might work for french fries or onion rings and other small items but not for deep frying of thick meat/fish portions.Suggest T-Fall return to drawing board on this one and get help from a food prep expert.Will return this fryer without hesitation."
2,Does not heat to 374 degrees.,"Read other reviews and like the design concept of this deep fryer. The heating element does not heat to the max of 374 degrees. Heating element lettering rubbed off at first cleaning. Product vendor has not responded to my request for a return. Concept good, operation bad. NOT recommended."
5,awesome oil drain system,"The way you can flip a switch and automatically drain & filter the oil works great. I thought it may be a gimmick, but it is totally legit. As for the frying part, it works as expected...Get's plenty of hot and recovers pretty quick... The basket cooking capicity is not huge, but is plenty large enough for my family."
4,Good Fryer,"Great product for the most part. The only bad thing is the position of the power light, which is hard to see, and the temperature settings that are painted on rubbed off in about a month. Product stays hot and cooks well."
5,"Really a 4-1/2 star, for one tiny issue.","I had seen a presentation of this fryer with a famous tv-chef's name attached to it, and thought it looked like just what I wanted (but I didn't care about the name or the ""Bam!""). So, I jumped online and found this one for $50 less than the one the chef was hawking, and I put it on my Christmas wish list. It does everything just as promised, is easy to clean, doesn't spatter, filters the frying odors, and produced excellent wings and sweet potato fries. The oil heats quickly, and returns to temp quickly after adding the food. The draining of the cooled oil is automatic and very clean (and kind of magical!). I'm impressed, and only wish the ""ready"" light was on the front of the control instead of above the dial: I have to stand on tip-toe or off to the side to see it when it's on my counter top, and I'm 5'5"" (average height for a woman, in other words). Other than that tiny issue, this fryer is top-notch."
4,Works well,"Am satified and with this fryer. I like the oil filter and cleanup is fairly easy. Fries well and adjustments are handy.The only negative is that the electrical cord connects very loosely and is easy to dislodge.Other than that, it's a great little fryer."
4,"Heat not fantastic, easy cleanup","Can't fry a lot at once with this - oil doesn't exceed 350 degrees and cools rapidly when a handful of room-temp food is introduced. Consumers who complain of oil leaking should observe the max oil level inside the fryer - if allowed to drain automatically (great feature BTW) and you exceed the max oil level, of course it's going to make a mess. EASY cleanup. The filter feature is silly - use either outside or under a range hood. For those who commented about overflowing oil, don't forget to turn on the range fan to remove the smell of oil."
5,Great Household Fryer,"Our In-Laws have the Emeril edition of this fryer, and it performs very well. However, this unit performs just as well fo far less money. We love it!! If there was anything negative it would be the size which makes storage a little tricky. We use for fish and chips and always frys quick with little clean-up. You won't be disappointed."
5,EZ Clean SS Pro Fryer,"I purchased this fryer for my daughter and her family. I have another brand and is of the type everything is in the stainless bucket and it does a good job of frying but cleaning it is a pain. This one is a five star unit. When you are finished frying you turn the knob and the oil drains through a strainer and the oil goes into a container under the unit. Everything else breads down and goes into the dishwasher except the element/controls. Where this is really a good thing, my daughter going to buy another container to have one for chicken and the other for seafood. As all of you know, when you fry chicken it will leave the oil with somewhat of poultry oder which is not desireble for seafood. Great unit and will be the next one I purchase, my daughter sold me on it."
4,Easy to clean just like it says.,"I love this deep fryer, after having a Deep Daddy Fryer for 20 years. This fryer does all that it advertises. The food is very flavorful, not greasy unlike my old fryer. I really enjoy the taste,texture and flavors of the food. The only negitive about this machine is the oders it puts into the room. Therefore I rated this machine at a 4 star rate."
1,It does leak for some...,"I bought this fryer, used it once, and it leaked. Luckily I had read other reviews and had placed a cookie sheet under it before I started. If you've ever used a common deep fryer you'll know that clean up is easier with one of those than with a fryer that spills copious amounts of oil onto your counter top. My other issue with this unit is that the oil level from the bottom of the basket to the infamous ""max level"" mark is less than the width of a corn dog. That's pretty shallow for a ""deep"" fryer."
2,"Long on concept, short on execution","Don't overfill and the filter part works fine. Sadly, mine has never been able to heat the oil past 320 degrees F. The 55 degree shortfall makes this more suitably referred to as a ""Deep Soaker"" rather than a ""Deep Fryer."" There is a reset button on the back that does not do anything but raise your hopes (The primary function of all reset buttons)."
2,temerature inadequate,"Bought this as a present for my girlfriend. The first time we used it I used a digital thermometer to check the accuracy of the unit. After setting it a 375 and waiting for the light to turn off, I checked to find that the temperature of the oil was only 338 and dropping. I let the unit turn back on again but it still never topped 338. It was precise but precisely wrong. I used it anyway, deep frying tempura oysters but they came out (after more than 3 minutes) pale and heavy with oil. Tried again with smelts but overcooked them before the batter would brown.Am I doing something wrong? Is there a peculiarity that I'm not picking up on? Is this only good for french fries? Is my heating unit faulty? Who knows? Either way, its unacceptable for such an expensive unit."
2,don't buy it,the thing leaks all over when you drain the oil what a mess.also it only heats to 325 when its set on 375 that means more grease in your food.only used 15 times.
1,Oil leaks,Cooks Ok tried to filter the oil and in ran everywhere what a mess!!!!!! Im probably going to return it!
5,Fry babee Fry!,"I bought this deep fryer to replace another, and I am ecstatic! The best part is it comes apart and goes in the dishwasher and it filters the oil after every fry. For those that had leakage problems, I would agree to not overfill past the MAX line even a little! The basket is large enough to fry a lot at once so you shouldn't need to overfill the box.The only improvement I would make is the location of the light. I am pretty short, so I can't readily see the light that tells the oil is ready. A minor inconvenience on an otherwise great fryer!"
4,EZPZ,Works just as advertised. Simple to filter oil and store for next use. Cleans up easily. Set it up under a stove hood and leave the hood fan running while oil cools and you won't get any smells in the house. I have to agree with other reviewers that the temperature sensor light could be in a better location. Perfect for small batches. Don't waste extra money on Emeril branded product. Everyone has their own kitchen timers!
5,Great!,"This fryer has worked great. Only dislike is that the window is virtually useless to check when food is ready since it gets ""clouded"" or condensation builds, I suppose depending on what you are preparing. Such easy clean-up! Well worth the extra $$ for us.Also, although I should have realized it :-( --we don't keep the fryer in the same place, so when following instructions in the manual on how to store the oil, it leaked as the fryer was moved. I would let eveyone know ahead of time, REMOVE the container (following instructions), move the fryer, and then REPLACE the oil container, again following manual."
5,All-round Great Deep Fryer,"After years of using a Fry Daddy and putting up with the odor, splatter and messy clean-up, I finally bit the bullet and upgraded. I am so glad I did. I got turned on to this particular model because Emeril uses and endorses a T-fal deep fryer. Now, I love Emeril, but buying the model with his name on it was a bit pretentious, even for me. So, I researched T-fal and discovered that this model is essentially the same (minus the digital timer, which experts recommend you don't use anyway to tell if your food is done, and the Emeril name, of course) $20 cheaper, too. It's an awesome deep fryer. I love the oil drainage/filtering feature, and it's a piece of cake to dismantle, wash and reassemble. The only thing I would recommend is to stick with the liquid oils (like canola). I purchased a cookbook for deep frying that recommended solid vegetable oils for the ""best"" fried chicken. Chicken was really good, but you can't drain and filter solid oil."
4,Extremely pleased,"T-Fal FR7008002 Ultimate EZ Clean Pro-Fryer Stainless-Steel 2-2/3-Pound Deep FryerI have really enjoyed using this fryer. The mess is virtually non-existant and clean-up is a breeze. The price was reasonable for the product, and the food cooks well. I would recommend it for anyone."
3,""" What Happened?""","We received this after doing research, and have been quite pleased with it,however it's stopped working! We have maintained it and clean it quite often, as my husband likes to share his Puerto Rican specialties such as empanadas, and tostones with friends & family. But last week for some reason, it stopped coming on. My husband, who is a mechanical engineer, has looked at it several times & he thinks this just stinks!! WE paid a good price, and we've had it less than a year and now its dead! I'mgetting in touch with Tfal to see if they offer a solution,if this is a common problem or what. I will keep this updated, so you'll know the results."
3,Almost 4 stars,I was pleased with how fast the fryer heats up and the end result of the food. My one big complaint is the draining system. I'm glad I read previous reviews and put a baking sheet under the fryer before draining because it leaked and was pretty messy. Otherwise I would have given it four plus stars.
1,Electrical failed,I purchased this unit and the electrical unit failed. I tried the reset button and it did nothing. I had to mail it back and they did send me a new unit in two weeks. Well I've used the new unit about 15 times over the course of the last year and the electrical unit has failed again. I have tried the reset button again--not sure what it is good for because it never reset anything. I feel this could definitely be a manufacturing defect.
