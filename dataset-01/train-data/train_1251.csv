1,tedious drivel,"Only one answer is crystal clear...the author Scott Smith needed the money...why else would he waste time on this tedious, repetitious piece of uninspiring drivel....How King can even mention this book in a semi-positive light...is beyond me...Unlike Smith, King doesn't need the money.. And people wonder why the novel is fast becoming extinct...Look no further!"
3,Good concept....kind of creepy.....KIND of,"The ruins was a good read, but not fantastic. The idea was creepy, but the characters in the story were just too damn annoying (Pablo) and stupid (Amy, Stacy, and Eric). This book should have been titled ""Spring Break Losers meet their fate on a mound of dirt"".I can easily see this book being made into a movie. It may not be half bad if they change a few things."
3,Ugh -- An Ordeal Just to Get Through!,"I had high hopes for this book and LOVED ""A Simple Plan."" Started this tale with much anticipation, but it fizzled. I got to the point where I felt I was suffering just to follow the narrative of the characters' suffering. For no point at all. Horrific escapism but not enteratainment, at least for me. Your mileage may vary."
2,After the Hype,"The buzz generated more than deserving word-of-mouth ... and, yes, the expectations ranked high. But after all the hoopla ... Smith's novel took off with an interesting start ... until it dwindled into the level of predictable and even incorrigible. When the reader ends up breezing through the pages, discerning the suspenseful from the all-too-fantastic, the interest must have been lost somewhere."
1,See Spot Run,"This book was unreadable, let alone disappointing. After the first 70 pages or so of, Jeff did this, Eric did that, Stacey made out with him...I couldn't finish this book. The writing style was as simplistic as the character development and I wasn't waiting aoround to see if either improved."
2,Big disappointment,"I bought this based on Entertainment Weekly and Stephen King's rave reviews but was very disappointed. I thought it was creepy until the characters actually arrive at the ruins and the reader discovers the ""horror"" there. First off, the characters are underdeveloped so when terrible things begin to happen I really didn't care about any of them. Secondly, once they're stuck the strange things that happen become repetitive and instead of spooky you know the outcome quickly. A lot of gore, no sense of real horror...I rarely skim books but I wound up skimming the last 100 pages because I just wanted it to end. If you enjoy horror skip this one."
1,Terrible Disappointment,"I loved ""A Simple Plan,"" and I really liked about the first 50-75 pages of this book . . . but it fell apart.I don't want to give away the plot, so I won't go into specifics.But the first part did a spectacular job of ratcheting up the tension . . . so much so that I found myself really eager to get back to the book to FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS.And I kept reading, and I began to become bored -- despite the truly godawful plight of these people -- and ready for it to be over. By at least a hundred pages before the book ended it was inexcapably obvious what was going to happen to them, so all you had to do was plod along to get through the gory (reall, really gory) details.And since I don't want to give away the plot I can't go into specifics about the adversary who does all this to them. I agree with the review I read in the NY Times, though -- it becomes so over-the-top the whole affair starts to be ludicrous.Very, very, very disappointing."
2,Lacking,"The beginning was good, actually almost all the way thru was good, although not original. Another plant gone bad. But was written well enough that you still read on .... until the end....what happened there...nothing! Let down."
1,Worst Book I have ever Read,"The whole story is just laughable, when it is supose to be ""Scary"". A plant with a brain! give me a break! The first time I have bought a book and have felt totaly ripped off. The worst author I have ever read. I feel sorry for who ever bought the film rights, they should stop production of the film and save there money. Use the script as a door stop! Scott Smith must be laughing all the way to the bank. I feel like a sucker to have listened to the hype of this book. I guess anyone can call themselves an Author. I would sell my copy to a used book store, but I don't want to promote this book in any way. I will use my copy, to start my barbaque next summer."
1,No climax No release No explations.,"I can't believe I finished this book. From about page 5 I stoped caring about the characters. I however wanted to know what was at the ruins. Each time the story got good - the point was chaged with no real explanation as to what really happened or why. I felt there was no reason for everyone's death. I am very surprised to see such high reviews from Stephen King. I really like King's books and thought since King liked it I would - wrong wrong and double wrong. I think I finished it just hoping there would be a surprise in the end and everything would be explaned. Wrong again. So no climax, no release, and no explations."
1,Tedious waste of time,"For the life of me I can't see how anyone could find this book 'intense', much less scary. The plot twists are minor league and telegraphed twenty pages in advance. You can see the ending coming almost from the moment they arrive at the ruins, and the only reason I kept reading was the belief that such a highly praised writer would never stoop to such an obvious cliche.The characters all spend a lot of time thinking back on previous times of their lives, the kind of stuff that is interesting to yourself but no one else. One character spends the biggest part of the book breathing in ""rasping, phlegmy"" gasps. The vine is really kind of goofy when you get right down to it, as well as inconsistent -- it might as well be yelling ""Feed me!"". There are a couple of gruesome scenes that feel shoe-horned in to an otherwise mundane story. I don't mind that there isn't a final explanation for it all, but there is so much left unsaid and unexplored that it feels more like lazy storytelling."
2,"Great start, Downhill after","I was very excited about this book. From the title, I had hoped it was a historical horror/thriller. But I was wrong, this is a book about the survival of six young people in a Mexican rainforest. Besides the heat, the lack of shelter and food, they have to survive against a ""monster"". This ""monster"" follows and listens to them everywhere they go. The kids can't escape and they have to manage to survive.I thought the book started off very well, intense and scary, but once you find out about the monster. It was a total disappointment. There is nothing about the history of the Mayans or the ruins or even the ""monster"". The ""monster"" just got stupider and faker as the book goes on. I would call it almost ""cheesy"". Anyway, I am very disappointed."
1,Couldn't finish it...truly disappointed...,I heard so many good things about this...waited on the paperback and bought it the day it came out...turned out to be a bore and I struggled to barely get 150 pages in. It just didn't hold my interest at all. Uninteresting and bland characters. Blah.
1,What a downer!,"I always know that if someone tells me a book or movie is ""brilliant"" that I will hate it. I want a good story that will entertain me and this most certainly didn't. No adventure here - just sickening frustration and hopelessness. It was overlong and endlessly depressing. After making a valiant effort I gave up, just read the end and threw it away. Next time someone tells me a book is ""brilliant"" I will know not to buy it!"
1,Horribly disappointing!,"This book sounding suspenseful and intriguing but was probably my most disappointing read of '06. The writing was fine, as was the character development, but I kept waiting for something to happen. After all, it is billed as a thriller. Hated it, hated it, hated it. Get ""Thirteenth Tale"" instead."
1,The Ruins - Scott Smith,Extremely slow moving book that deals with with too much narrative about students stuck in a well being attached by Mayan Indians. I found it boring and offensive to the Maya.
2,waited for something to happen,"W T F ????i remember being riveted to 'a simple plan' and 'the ruins' got such great writeups i was expecting to be up all night reading it.well it's such a nothing book....i kept waiting for something BIG to happen...when the 'villian' was finally revealed, let's just say, i was not impressed..it seemed totally cinematic...no real story...the scary 'thing' was laughable...what a shame! i was looking forward to a wild ride..."
2,"""Ruined"" expectations..","Wow. All the hype..a Stephen King recomendation..how could you go wrong? But I have to say that I was really disappointed with this book. I won't give away any of the story other than..can you say ""Little Shop of Horrors""? Just plain silly."
1,Disappointed,"I bought the book based upon Stephen King's review that it would do for vacations what Jaws did for beaches and I have to say I was seriously disapointed. The reason I read is to learn or to be entertained and I was neither.However, I was left frustrated that the existence of the vine and its' connection with the Mayans (did they worship it, were they enslaved by it) was not explained.This was nothing more than a very long, poorly written comic book."
3,A yawner from start to finish,"For a plot with so much potential, this was a boring read. With a protagonist that should have been truly horrific, the characters never really showed any fear. They were slow to realize the nature of their adversary, and once they did, never really seemed afraid. When they realized the power of the adversary, they seemed to merely resign themselves to their fate. While giving up may indeed by the normal human reaction in such circumstances, it makes for a boring book."
4,Good but distracting,"This was a decent little book marred by a few unfortunate choices by the author.The author has chosen to write a book about personal relationships in a confined and futile space, which works well enough if you only read it as that. However thats not whats it sold as, not what you expect reading it and not how the book itself sets it up.It creates an environment that cries out for more of a story and leaves you scratching your head: with plot holes, character issues, inconsistenties and crying why?Why? When the setting could just as easily have been something mundane like Fell down a Well or Trapped in a Mine, in which case you wouldnt spend the book going ""Hmmm why didnt they try that or do this or explore that?????"" and with the vague feeling that there should have been more ploting and something more should have happened."
3,Expectinig More,"As we followed the group throughout the story, I stared to care less and less for them. The book seemed to drag on and on. I was excited at first and really got into the story. The middle lost me somewhere. At the end I was listening to hear what happened, only to be disappointed in the end. The book had such possibility, but just fell short. All in all, an okay book, but I wouldn't bother reading it unless you have some time to kill."
3,Carniverous Flower??,"Well, I had really expected to according to the title to read about ""ruins"", which I didn't, but I did enjoy the book to a point, but I kept expecting something more than the story delivered. It was a creepy scenario and definitely gory, but an interesting concept. Sort of like the ""Kudzu that ate the South"". But it is ""fiction"" and I thought the story would make a good ""survival"" segment. Twilight Zone anyone."
2,"Some good parts, but way too long.","Comparisons to ""A Simple Plan"" aren't really fair since this is a completely different genre.However, the book is definitely 100 pages too long. It's really a very thin story that is all build-up with no ending.There are some really exciting sections that will make your hair stand-up (worthy of early Stephen King) but they are separated by long, plotless sections that really weigh the story down.Not as bad as some of the one-star reviews suggest, but those looking for originality at the end will be very disappointed."
1,Is that really it....vines that eat people?? C'mon,This is perhaps one of the most boring books I've ever read. It is NOT terrifying or even remotely scary. The first real page turning section (going down in the mine) becomes tedious and long-winded. This pace unfortunately continues throughout the book. There is just enough tension to make the book readable. I kept hoping for something more to the story and was disappointed when that didn't happen. Stephen King should be ashamed of himself for writing a glowing review of such a boring book.
1,Scott Smith Has Lost It,"Scott Smith's 1st novel, ""A Simple Plan"" was one of my all-time favorites, and I was anxious to read his latest book. What a disappointment! I quit reading when i had finished less than half of the book, and feel I should have quit long before that.The story, and the characters are disgusting and boring. I do have to say, however, that Mr. Smith has not lost his ability to write great prose, I just wish he had put that ability to better use than this."
2,Maybe I'm out of step here...,"but this book underwhelmed me. The amount of suspended disbelief that it takes to make it through all 319 pages is immeasurable. I was never drawn in, never felt empathy for the characters, never felt as it this was ""Jaws"" in the jungle. Wait for the library, or the paperback."
1,Please do not bother,"I, like many people, was a big fan of Scott Smith's book, A Simple Plan. What set it apart from others in the genre was a well thought out plot with twists and turns you did not see coming. Unfortunately the same is not true of The Ruins. As engrossing as A Simple Plan's plot was, this one is just as flat out boring. I saw the end coming a third into the book but kept kidding myself that because it was Scott Smith something big would happen. Needless to say - it never did. I would rank this as mediocre in the cheap horror genre at best. I have not been this disappointed in a novel in several years. I hope Smith's next novel is better than this but am not sure I would read it to find out."
3,Not what I expected but still good...,"The Ruins managed to keep my attention till the end, however I found it irritating at times then at the end downright shocking (<-- this is a compliment). I won't ruin what the ""creature"" is if you have not read this one already however what I will say is that I was dissappointed. Having read the likes of ""The Terror"" by Dan Simmons or ""Graveyard Shift"" by Stephen King I was really hoping for the best in terms of scary but alas it was not to be. The characters are fantastic though and you can really relate to them and their experience, however if you in the mood for a great read try ""The Terror"" instead. On another note though, if you in a foreign land and a local tells you not to go somewhere because it is a ""bad place"" just don't go."
2,Not What I Expected . . .,"Scott Smith gathered a great deal of attention with his genius thriller ""A Simple Plan,"" which is still one of my favorite books ever, but seems to fall short with this one. Maybe it was because I was expecting something similar to his first book, but I really think he took a wrong turn somewhere with this novel. This book has all the qualities of a low budget, B-Rated horror flick and wasted a lot of paper putting them shamefully into action. Besides the lack of character depth, and rambling pages of the characters trying to treat their rotting cuts and broken limbs, the ""evil"" monster stalking the young men and women does nothing but bring cartoonish images in my head of ""The Little Shop of Horrors."" Don't waste your time with this one!"
4,The Ruins,"This is not the type of novel that I normally read but I enjoyed ""A Simple Plan"" so much that I decided to read this one. I can tell you it's a genuine page turner. You keep waiting for something good to happen to the group but.... Wups, I'm about to spoil the book for you.Suffice it to say I'm not going to Coba' to see the Mayan ruins on my next cruise to Cozumel."
2,King mislead me!,"I had just finished reading King's Lisey's Story and thought it was great, couldn't put it down. So when I noticed he had wrote a review about the Ruins I thought great this will be a good one too. King said ""the Ruins is going to be America's literary shock-show this summer, doing for vacations in Mexico what Jaws..."" Oh Paleeze!"" It reminded me of a teenage horror movie. The kind where it's so dumb you just have to keep watching just to mock it. I didn't expect an intellectual story, I'm used to the fantasy and suspense that King offers so I don't mind if a story is ""unrealistic"" but it wasn't even scary. Believe me I won't think twice about watering my Creeping Charlie. Don't waste your money. If you feel compelled to read it just out of curiosity, like a train wreck, check it out at the library. I did and thank goodness!"
1,big disappointment,"I enjoyed the spare trajectory of his first book, A SIMPLE PLAN, and hoped for more in this one. Instead we get a very busy, rambling, noisy story full of long, tedious memories from the protagonists, and an utterly improbable story about acid-filled vines that apparently have consciousness. The story line is cluttered with unnecessary sex scenes and a seeming fascination by the author for bodily functions, for we have to know when anyone has to ""go"" and be treated to details of its passing. Happily, one can skip entire pages of reverie to return to the story line, if you get hooked and have to know how it ends. Boring and contrived."
1,Let's be honest....pretty bad,"Maybe I am missing some subtlety, and I will admit I am not a big reader of the horror genre, but this was just pretty bad on a variety of levels. I would hate for horor fans to hold this up as a masterpiece of the genre as that would just be sad.This is horribly repetitive stuff.The repetition of some events designed to build suspense I would think in a failed attempt to make this exciting somehow. There are a few moments where the reader can see that the author was building to a big 'reveal' that just wasn't interesting or scary. It is a mishmash of borrowed plots (borrowed from pretty silly sources sadly) told in an indifferent narrative style that overshadowed by the plots ridiculousness.As it is essentially a B grade monster horror movie story (a la The Blob, or Tremors (remember that one?)) this will probably make a passable short (please God make it short) popcorn movie....I just pity the actor who has to try and make a character out of what's on the page here."
2,I really wanted to like this book...,"I was hooked by the title and the premise - Spooky ancient ruins in the Yucatan penninsula, but then I read the book...there aren't even any ruins to speak of, just the IDEA of ruins...the book was reasonable, building some tension, but once you figure out what is going on, it's like, huh? Are you serious? At that point you kind of have to finish the book, just out of curiosity, hoping that maybe, just maybe, some new twist or nemesis is going to enter the picture, but alas, it just keep going, and going, and then it ends. Sorry Scott Smith, you are no Stephen King."
1,WORST.BOOK.EVER.,"Even though I looked up the book on here before I bought it, I should have given it a second thought. It had nothing but positive reviews, 4 and 5 stars. But this had to be the single most appallingly unpleasant book I've read in a long time.The story starts bleakly enough but it only gets worse. A little warning that it's the most violent and disgustingly graphic would have been nice as well. And the ending?! Can we even call it that? At least American Psycho left me with something to ponder about after I slaved through all that depravity."
1,"Contrived, repetitive, ridiculous","I wanted to really enjoy this book. Stephen King's review fooled me. I usually savor books and read them slowly and thoroughly. But this was so repetitive, I found myself skipping over entire pages and not missing a thing. Extremely contrived. Why didn't they all die in the first 5 minutes. What a flat ending. I'm not talented, but I could have come up with any number of better endings. I was disappointed."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK..even for those who DON'T read much,"This is one book(if you are into horror,that is)that you seriuosly WON'T want to put down once you get into it!..I know I couldn't.I usually don't read fiction,BUT this is a great book.Period.This makes me actually excited for the movie..which I'm sure won't be as good...sadly..For those of you wanting an eerie experience in a book..pick this one up. I just started another Scott Smith book ""A simple plan""..so far so good..I have a feeling he'll be a favorite author of mine in no timeUPDATE;A SImple Plan WAS a great book(a little slow to get going,but good)NOW -IF THIS AUTHOR WOULD WRITE ANOTHER DAMN BOOK! JEEEEEZ!!!"
2,A Bit Disappointing,"Very slow moving until about 2/3rds of the way through. I only finished it because I wanted to know what happened at the end. For those of you that read it, I thought the end was a missed opportunity. When the Greeks were coming toward the hill calling their names, 'they' should have answered from the top of the hill."
2,Gruesome but predictable,"You cannot spend half the book trying to kill someone, to finally do it with no surprises."
2,"Dismal, Drear, Disappointing","Being all set for a great Stephen K. type thriller, I jumped into this book with great expectations,(afterall, the KING said it was great). Wow, was I disappointed. It went on and on with no redeeming qualities, and no believeable horror. I read it to the end just to see how this mess would play out and was further disappointed. I don't think it would have even made a good short story. Usually when I'm in the middle of a book I find myself looking forward to getting back to it. This one waited like a pile of dirty dishes. Don't bother."
2,Prone to Depression?,"There can be little doubt that Smith is a fine writer. The introspective digressions of the various principal characters in Ruins, coupled with the author's intelligently spaced revelations of their pasts provide a very literary underpinning of this tale of horror and suspense. But, for a reader who slips easily into depression my recommendation is to put this one back on the shelves and look for something a bit more traditional in the science fiction genre. I had to drink Starbucks three days in a row after finishing this book, to reestablish my faith in the possibility of a happy future. I suppose, in a way, this is a compliment to the author!"
4,Highly recommended,"The Ruins by Scott Smith is an exceptional book. It tells the story of six young people, forced to cope with the situation which starts as horrifying, and then keeps getting worse with a speed of a roller coaster. It's a fascinating study of human nature under unbelievably overwhelming trauma. Be warn however, that reading (or listening to) this book is not a pleasant experience. The book is disturbing both because of events it describes and because the author does not spare any details, no matter how ugly or inappropriate. In this regard The Ruins resemble naturalistic poems of Charles Baudelaire. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is willing to appreciate serious literature. This is not a book for those who prefer simple novels with fast paced action."
3,Something Eerie,"If you like horror stories The Ruins is for you. Compelling plotting. Irritating wordiness. Unnecessary back-stories. Amiss editing. Privileged slackers character's. Thank you, Scott B. Smith. This was storying telling at its worst and best."
2,This book ruined my vacation!,"I picked this book to read for the times in my vacation when I am relaxing by the beach and pool coz it was recommended by Stephen King as the horror book for the new century. Well, I loved my vacation except for one thing and that is...this book! I've been reading horror novels since I was 12 and now I'm let's just say past 35. It felt like the author is trying to write a book hoping it'll be made into an awful 2-star movie in the sci-fi channel. Too simple. Too predictable. Too boring. Waste of time."
2,"Horrifying, grotesque, morbid, and depressing","Not so much scary as horrifying, grotesque, morbid, and depressing. If your idea of a good read is ""watching"" people trapped in a horrifying situation that they can't escape from suffer, you'll love this book."
4,A Great Read,Completely engrossing and far-fetched horror story. A simple plot so probably wouldn't make a good book report but the implausibilities are smoothed over by expert storytelling about the unexpected. Perfect summer read.
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this book in spite of Stephen King's praise, which I NEVER trust.The book does keep you reading and that's why I gave it 3 stars.I can't get past the thought that the ""horror"" in this book is justAudrey from The Little Shop of Horrors gone native.I mean, really, who makes the ""big bad"" in a horror novel bea plant? That being said, I didn't hate the book, but I wouldn'tcall in great either. Like I said, it DOES keep you reading alongat a brisk pace."
3,Great idea - could have been better executed,"This book was indeed the page-turner most reviewers indicate in their reviews - initially. But for this reader, the book began to drag and became less of a page-turner and more a chore to read by the last forty pages or so. It is almost as if the author, Scott Smith, ran out of ideas on how to finish the story, and the spellbinding (and vine-binding) promise at the beginning begins to dissipate into boredom, the inevitable, and the utterly predictable - which is exactly how it ends. What started out as a great read turned into an okay one. Too bad."
1,Don't waste your time,"This is one of the lamest books I have read in years. It was a waste of money and my time. The story is not scary, but laughable. The ending was predictiable. With so many other books out there - do yourself a favor and don't waste your time reading this one."
1,TERRIBLE!,"Very disappointed, cannot believe I wasted money on this book. I love to read, and enjoy just about everything. I have no idea why anyone would say this is an enjoyable novel. It did not have any plot to speak of, and the ending of this book left you feeling let down. Would not recommend at all!"
2,Very Little Happens,Interesting premise but ultimately a boring story. It's just one damn thing after another for the gringo tourists and then no real payoff at the end.
2,Not a Thriller,"Scott Smith's first book, A Simple Plan, was excellent and kept the reader guessing about what would happen next. It used human nature and temptations to great effect to make the reader believe and relate to how people's actions can lead to such catastrophic consequences.In The Ruins, all of that is missing. The action does not involve the reader. I was actually bored through much of it. The story was absolutely unbelievable and made no sense, and seemed only an effort to shock the reader with gory details."
2,The Ruins,"Didn't thrill me...I was able to read, then skip chapters, and I could still figure out what happened in between. Needless to say..""foliage"" didn't seem too horrifying for me. The story was centered around a group of college kids and I felt like I was reading something like ""I know what you did last summer"""
1,Very disappointed....,"I think I need to go back and look at Stephen King's comments on this book, his tag line which is used to promote this book leaves me wondering what the heck he was thinking. BTW, I am a huge King fan.The story was far more repulsive than chill inducing. To me this title of this book should have been ""My Life as a Plant"" by Michael Myers.I would have given it another star if they would have at least did a back story on the plant and its origins. The pychological drama that unfolds between the college kids seemed thin to me. As young adults most of do and say idiotic things, wow, what a surprise.Keep browsing, there are better reads out there."
1,I was rooting for the vines!,This is the worst book I experienced in 2006. I listened to the audio book and stuck with it in hopes for a good ending. Nope.The mixed reviews I have seen on this book are the only interesting thing to come out of it; now I have one less thing in common with Steven King.
1,A total waste of time,"Well,there's a few hours of my life that I'll never get back.I'm stubborn, so I read it to the end. A total waste of time.A Perfect Plan followed by another disappointment, The Ruins. I've had enough, I'll not bother to read anything else by Scott Smith."
1,somebody shoot me for bothering to pick up this book.,"THIS BOOK IS MUCH LONGER THAN IT SHOULD BE. I HAVE TO AGREE WITH THE LATER REVIEWS ON THIS BOOK. LAME.LONG.DULL.GLAD IT WAS A LIBRARY BOOK AND NOT PURCHASED, WOULD HAVE BEEN A WASTE OF HARD EARNED CASH. WANT SOMETHING GOOD TO READ, GET THE NEW BOOK BY PRESTON AND CHILD Book of the Dead."
4,Plan to be up all night with this book,"I have read this book several times, and each time the story just carries me away. I love the way Smith holds the reader's attention from the cheerful beginning to the bitter end. Some parts really had me squirming, thinking there's no way I would ever do something like that, no matter how bad circumstances got. But who knows what horrors the human mind is capable of in the right setting?"
1,1/2 star at best,"It sounded like a good book but don't be deceived. Imagine me waving my hands trying to dissuade you from getting this book, few will listen and will pay the price....The writing doesn't really draw you in. It is like the difference between a radio verses stereo. You read and understand but it doesn't really get you to the place where you are experiencing the horror.The characters were unbelievably shallow and in no way likable. Certainly no one I would like to spend several days or even hours with (neither was this book)."
1,Horrible,"This was just a silly book. I can't believe that some people actually liked it. The premise is dumb and the characters don't behave realistically in my opinion (e.g. why didn't they try to cut/burn/rip-out the vines?). There is so little action in the story that the descriptions of every single task the characters do (e.g. collecting rain water) seem to go on forever. This smacks of a book written just to be turned into a screenplay. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to learn this was a screenplay turned into a book. Hard to believe Smith, who seems to be able to write well, would sacrifice his reputation by allowing this to be released."
1,What a waste of my time,If you like dialogue don't bother. There really wasn't any until the end when they were all getting killed. HOnestly this book seemed like it was written to be made into a horror movie. I kept reading (my fault) hoping it would get better. It didn't. The end was such a huge disapointment. Really awful book. I can't imagine anyone liking this book.
3,"Horror aficionados may love it, but it wasn't for me","I can understand why readers are so divided on this book. It's a very compelling premise, and the story unfolds in such a way that it's almost impossible not to get sucked in... but the experience is not pleasant. Reading the whole novel is a lot like driving past a horrific accident on the freeway, very slowly, with your head stuck in a Clockwork Orange contraption so you literally can't look away.Personally, I made it to page 222 and gave up. I read the (very thorough) plot summary on Wikipedia, and am glad that I stopped when I did. Keep in mind that I'm a huge fan of Stephen King, Dean Koontz, Neil Gaiman and Robert McCammon. I'm not a total wimp. However, I'm not tough enough for this stuff. I need some ray of light in the darkness of human misery."
2,Long and silly,"Scott Smith's A Simple Plan was and is one of my favorite books-fantastic. I wondered whether he ever wrote another. When I saw this I had to buy it and start it right away. For the first 100 pages I thought Smith had done it again, unfortunately the hundreds of pages after were slow, drawn out, and frankly, just silly. I know in horror you must sometimes suspend judgment and reality, but this was too much, and not at all scary."
2,A terrible letdown,"I don't understand what the fuss is about this book or the author. I found it ham-fisted, with crayon-drawn characters whom I could not muster a whiff of care about. The ""villian"" in this story is also crudely and ineptly executed, and the plot itself has too many holes that trucks could be driven through.I was bored halfway through, never in the least bit terrified."
3,More sci-fi than thriller,"I did make my way to the end of this book. I had enjoyed A Simple Plan very much, although I am not usually a fan of thrillers. Smith is a very good story-teller, his prose moves and is clear, but in Ruins I felt his characters weren't interesting enough to hold sway for 300 pp. Also, I was hoping to get a little travelogue into the Mayan Ruins, but to my mind, there was very little in this regard. I continued to plod through this book b/c I wanted to glimpse some sweet moment of redemption at the end, some reprieve from the heaviness and despair, but Smith is a fatalist. This is a character study of how 4 young men and women face the snuffing out of their lives against an implacable foe, but to my mind, there weren't enough twists and dimension to the characters to make this a captivating read. Chilling, depressing, yes, captivating, no. I won't be so pre-disposed to pick up Smith's next book."
2,The impossible to kill kudzu in my back yard is scarier,"I will not beat a dead horse, since I agree with the other negative reviews.Any book where you hope all the characters die because they are so whiny and unappealing is not worth more than 2 stars. I now have a rule of thumb. I will not buy any book for which Stephen King writes a positive blurb. King is (or was til his last couple of books) one of my favorite writers, but this is the umpteenth time I've read a book he has positively blurbed. These books have been at best mediocre, and mostly have stunk. This one stunk."
2,Absurdity Trumps Horror,"The biggest mystery about The Ruins is why Stephen King waxed on about it being a great summer beach read. There is little mystery here and the absurd premise spawns incredulity rather than horror.Wow! Plants that can imitate cell phones, people's voices, all while plotting the demise of anyone who wanders on to their killing hill.The Mayans, living nearby, have solved the problme of the plants invading further territory by salting the ground around the hill. So, a plant endowed with supernatural powers is defeated by a ring of Morton's.The faceless Mayans remain ushers in the this theatre of the absurd, making sure that no one leaves the hill where the plants mimic, invade and eventually conquer the hapless characters in this long awaited, but vastly disappointing second novel."
1,Should have been a short story...,"Sorry, but I have to weigh in on the side of the disappointed. There was nothing ""horrifying"" about this novel, other than its length. Paragraph after paragraph of mind-numbing narrative, when simplicity would have had much greater impact. So disappointing because Mr. Smith's ""A Simple Plan"" was exactly that--a great story, plainly told. ""The Ruins"" should have been edited by about 95% and published as a short story."
2,Not At All What I Was Expecting,"I was so disappointed with this after loving 'A Simple Plan' so much. I guess the bottom line is that this just wasn't what I expected. I think Scott Smith is a great writer, and there were parts of this I couldn't move my eyes fast enough to find out what was going to happen. I just think people expecting a disturbing out of control scenario like ""Plan' could be in for a surprise. This feels like what Stephen King would do if he had written the hit tv show 'Lost'. Yes the book is plenty suspenseful,and to me, it's strengths lie in the horror of how people react to a certain situation, not necessarily because of the event or object itself. However, I felt by the end it was becoming a tad silly ala 'Little Shop of Horrors', and I found myself rolling my eyes a bit."
1,Horrible!,"Stupid plot, stupid dialogue. Is this a high school creative writing project? A total waste of time and paper!"
2,"Entertaining read, but...","I agree with some of the previous reviewers - it's a real page-turner, but definitely a bit anticlimactic. I was annoyed with how the story wrapped up. No explanation or satisfaction at all related to the absurdity of the situation..."
2,A Simple Book,"Early on, I knew where all the plot trails had to end up. Along the way, equally predictable horror and gore; still, Smith's characters were interesting and complex, and therefore enough to keep me reading till the end.My $.02: a fine writer harnessed to a lame premise. Smith is a brilliant observer of humans in extremis, but horror is not his genre; the peril his characters face should be real, and of their own making -- not Audrey II.I'm sure a decent scary movie is on the boards right now; in fact, this story should have gone right to script."
2,Ten years for this?,"I read The Ruins with great anticipation following Stephen King's recommendation and all I can say is what a letdown.The journey of innocents into the heart of darkness echoes Blair Witch meeting Lost with a soupcon of Little Shop of Horrors, with a hill substituting for the shop.I wanted to reach into the text and throttle the characters for being so stupid, which I guess is a necessary precondition for horror. The source of the horror is so silly that it snaps any willing suspension of disbelief.If you want to read a good book about a steady downward spiral, then read Six Bad Things by Charlie Huston,a far better book."
1,Pointless and cheap scare tactics...,"This is the first review I have ever posted on Amazon, and I am compelled to do so because of the rot this novel is. It is basically one cheap and disgusting act after another - the author trying to one-up himself over and over and over again. Talk about being hit in the head repeatedly with the proverbial frying pan!!! There is no back story and no context to the events that occur in ""The Ruins"". I felt totally manipulated by each event - each more disgusting and unpalatable than the event before it. After a particularly detailed and pointless surgical procedure on one of the characters, Pablo, I began to skip ahead - and finally determined that I would not waste one more second of time on this book. I cannot believe Stephen King, an author whom I adore, recommended this book. There is no subtlety or nuance to the book. It is totally pointless, unless the point is to see if the author can out-gross himself. I would give this book ZERO stars if I could."
1,You'll Find This Book Hard To Read!!,"This book is very hard to read because your eyes will have rolled up so far into your head you won't be able to see anyomre.I'm certainly willing to admit that it is a page turner and I found the early scenes in the mine to be rather chilling, but once you find out what the actual menace is, and what it is able to do, you'll want to kill yourself for getting that far. It's really no wonder that Stephen King enjoyed this book, since it's basically his ""The Raft"" stretched out to a ridiculous length. Don't believe the hype."
1,Tedious book,This was the most tedious and predictable book I have EVER read. Bought it because Stephen King said it was good. It was not.
3,Engrossing--but gross,"The beginning of this novel is a lot like the show ""Lost."" Four young Americans and a Greek and a German friend are taking a little hike into the Mexican jungle. They are looking for the German's brother, who ran off chasing after a hot archeologist chick. As soon as they enter the jungle, weird stuff starts to happen.But then, somewhere in the 100-page vicinity, you start to figure out what is really going on. And from then on out, this book is pure horror. Stephen King territory. And it was psychologically freakin' harrowing. I had a hard time finishing the book. It's difficult to imagine something so implausible could be so scary, but this book scared the hell out of me. At times it made my physically nauseous. Does that make it a good book? I have no idea. Read at your own risk - not for the faint of heart."
3,Horror,"It's an ok fiction book. Not super well written but well enough that it's a quick read. I have not yet finished the book, I started yesterday & got about 200 pages or so in. It's interesting what Smith is trying to do with horror. It's not someone ripping apart the characters or psychologically terrorizing them, it's a totally natural predator which makes it pretty interesting. I'm a little disappointed with the character development, the women are ""simpering fools"" as I told my husband. He read it before me so he's asking where I am & what I think. I am very attracted to strong female characters & when someone writes a female I now almost expect to see her strong & willing to fight instead of flee.Overall this book is good, it grasps your attention & doesn't let it go. I had a hard time trying to put it down to go to bed :)"
2,WHERE ARE THE EDITORS?,"A compelling premise when combined with stereotypical, static characters results in a 319-page interminable read. Sadly, I find almost every book lately is an overblown short story. If memory serves Stephen King already did a similar tale with his usual panache, perhaps explaining his favorable review. See if you don't agree this book should have been trimmed by half, thereby ramping up the tension and reader enjoyment, as well as freeing time better spent on more deserving books."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing story. Two dimensional characters that I really didn't care about. Descriptions of what the ""creature"" does to the hapless adventurers is creepy, edge-of-your-seat squirming fun but I felt there was no substance to the story. This becomes just another teenagers at the lake being picked-off one-by-one cliche.This could have been an excellent sci-fi or paranormal story but instead, I'm disappointed that I bought this book."
1,Little Shop of Horrors,"This book is just plain worthless. No intelligence at all when a plant outsmarts the human race.I have seen the vine eats human trick in ""Little Shop of Horrors"", funny, musical. This book is the same thing, but the author has no sense of humor;; maybe. The serious parts are actually quite amusing. I could see Tarantino directing this film as an over the top horror spoof in hombrage to the genre."
3,Why make it gross?,Loved the book at first... Then the blood and guts started to happen. What started as a good story - turned into something I'm not sure I'm too interested in finishing. If they make this book a movie - I'll pass.Or maybe I should just stop reading this book right before I go to bed.I stayed with the book till the very end. And it never got any better... At all.
2,Reluctant Read,"This book was promising at first, then became tedious in the middle, and slowly deteriorated at the end. I am not a big fan of science-fiction and when I found what course this story was taking, I still had to see it through to the bitter end."
1,I want a refund,"I cannot get the time back that was wasted trying to read this drawn out go nowhere book, but I should be able to get my money back. I would feel guilty trying to sell it for a quater at a garage sale."
1,Boring,"If you find this story tedious and boring in the beginning, don't waste additional time reading on. It doesn't get any better."
1,Such a huge disappointment!,"This novel was hyped up soo much in the press and I was really anxious to read it but I was shocked at how little fright I got from it.Maybe I'm a hardened horror fan, but I found this to be neither thrilling nor horrifying. When I started the book, I had no idea what the ""horror"" or monster in question was. When I found out, I really tried to work with it, conceptually, but eventually, I was just bored and skipped to the end - which gave me a little satisfaction. But, I wouldn't recommend this book at all to anyone who is interested in a good horror book. You will be bored, not frightened."
2,A Simple Disappointment!,"I absolutely loved ""A Simple Plan"". It kept you quessing the whole time. The Ruins was not even close. It was far-fetched with very little character development; and in fact I really didn't care what happened to them. I just wanted to put them out of their misery, and for the book to be over! Scott took 12 years off, so I think he could have come up with a more plausable novel. This just dragged on and on with ridiculous situation after ridiculous situation. Save your money on this one. Re-read ""A Simple Plan"" or read Koontz,'s ""Velocity"" for more enjoyment."
2,Skilful writing - unoriginal story,"WARNING: Possible spoiler (but it might save you $$)What you have here is your basic dead teenager formula: start with five beautiful 20-somethings, trap them in a secluded location, sprinkle in man-eating vines, then start slowly killing them off. When they're all dead you've reached the end of the book. No wonder Stephen King liked it - he's followed this template in a dozen short stories.As far as the title goes, forget it. There are no ruins. My guess is that the published knew they wouldn't sell as many books if they called it ""Killer Sentient Mexican Vines,"" which would have been more appropriate.The two stars are for the author's craft in telling the story: Good pacing and suspense."
3,Just OK (kind of a spoilerso if you haven't read the book don't read my review),"I wish I could get as enthusiastic about this book as the people who gave it 5 stars....it started so DAMN slow, I almost put it down. I will say that once they got trapped on the hill, it was hard not to finish the book. I appreciate the characters, although those girls were...just irritating. I kept putting myself in the situation and I could see just wanting to slap the both of them. Writing a book about ""killer"" vines takes a lot imagination and I give Scott Smith credit for creating a story where there are so many things going on, so many language barriers....but I don't think the book deserved 5 stars. The ending is what really got me....here come the Greeks, three days later now that everyone has met their fate....."
1,Very disappointed,"I placed three orders for the photo frame coasters in a wood stand ( Total of 35 ). The packaging they came in was dirty as if they were left on a shelf for months. After opening them, the sides of most of the coasters were loose. I could have glued them back together, but when you are purchasing something you shouldn't have to fix them yourself. I was very disappointed not only with the product, but also with the response from Amazon. The replacement sets that I received were just as bad. I questioned about quality control and the response was that sometimes things are good and sometimes bad. Not a kind of response from such a large company that you would expect."
2,Poor quality,"Not very good quality...1. They are painted unevenly, so the ""rectangle"" in the center is anything but. These centers are crooked and lopsided on pratically every coaster in my set of 8.2. The slot for the photos is very large, allowing them to shift around and even fall out of the coaster.3. The pieces glued to the underside fall off after a couple of months of use.Something to watch out for in all glass coasters - we didn't anticipate this problem:4. Place a cool glass on one of these coasters, and the condensation forms a seal with the smooth glass, which causes the coaster to stick to the glass when lifted, and increases the odds that the coaster will fall and break."
2,don't bother,"I purchased these coasters and a similar set. I don't care for these at all. They are cheaply made- the pics slide into a metal piece on the back. Mine arrived chipped and scratched. And the ""mat"" around the picture isn't a mat at all, it's just painted glass- which easily comes off. The space for the photo is small, as well."
4,A gift that went very well-,I got this for a freind as a gift and she loved it- I loaded it up with some pictures of friends and got a great response.
2,Poor quality,"I purchased a similar set of photo coasters from Crate and Barrel. They make a terrific gift. But, this particular set from Amazon is sure to disappoint. When the Amazon product arrived, one of the glass coasters was chipped and the wooden stand was broken. Based on the reviews below, it sounds like this is a systematic problem with this product. Save yourself the headache of battling Amazon's return department and purchase something of quality in the first place."
4,Gift idea,"Bought them for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day. She really liked them, and if you like to display pictures and use coasters in rooms that are casual, these are great for you."
1,poor quality unlike previous orders,I ordred again from the same supplier. Some were good some were mis-shapen but Amazon made that right.However now I re-order and thin cheap coasters arrive. No warning of this.Very poor from a seller I will not deal with again
2,Diminishing quality,"I purchased an inexpensive set like this (~8) years ago and it has held up to abuse. This set appears exactly the same from the photos but significant details are missing. The glass is 1/2 as thick as the original; therefore, I doubt these will last nearly as long as the previous set. More importantly the metal picture keeps (the base that holds the picture in place) have been discontinued for a heavy card stock and the water resistant picture covers are no longer included. I suspect this will be a obvious design flaw if you foresee condensation in your future.Admittedly pessimistic, I will likely pursue the slightly more expensive options on this site in the event these coasters fail."
2,Great coasters but cheap stand,"I bought 2 sets of these coasters for mother's day, one for my mother and one for my mother in law. The coasters themselves are very nice. Thick heavy and of good quality. But the wood stands that are included are a piece of crap! When I opened up the package, the two sides of the stand were completely disconnected from the bottom piece on one set and on the other set one of the sides had come off. Next time I will buy in the store..."
2,cheaply made,these coasters seemed nice until i started looking at them closely. there's fingerprints underneath the glass on 3 out of 4. super disappointed
3,Good but some of the wood frame was chipped,"The frame/coasters are as they look in the picture. I purchased 5 to make gifts for friends and some of them had marks on the wood (holder) part. Overall, they looked very nice and the girls loved them but I wish the holders were a bit more high quality."
2,Terrible design and quality,"5 seconds after removing these from the box I have already decided they're never going on my coffee table. First, the ""wood"" holder is badly chipped and there are bits of black paint all over the coasters. But worse, the coasters themselves (which are tools meant to protect the finish of a table, if I'm not mistaken) have a metal backing with a fairly sharp edge underneath where the photo goes. It doesn't take a genius to recognize that within a few days of regular use that metal edge would cause all sorts of damage to a table much worse than a ring of moisture ever would, despite the tiny rubber feet on the bottom. As a test I found that I was easily able to shave the finish off a corner of an old table with no effort at all. Glad I only paid $10 since I'm sure I'll never get my money back."
3,Fine but not what pictured,"When I got them everything was to be expected except the backing part that held the photos. In the photos provided the backing was metal, what I received was glass coasters with a paper thin plastic backing held on with thick double-sided tape. I ordered two sets at different times and both arrived with the same kind of backing. I wish I knew before I ordered the first set, I needed 8 coasters for my project so I felt I had little choice if I wanted all 8 to match. So far it holds together but I fear for the long-run."
2,Wasn't impressed,"My sister-in-law had bought something similar to this as gifts for Christmas. I thought they were really cute and wanted to get some for my step-brother. These, however, were disappointing. The picture size is very small, and the translucent paint was chipped on some of the coasters. They seem to be very cheaply made. My advice - look elsewhere!"
3,Coasters,I liked this product except a couple of the coasters were scratched when I got them. They ended up turing out nice when I got the right size picture to fit.
3,"Lovely book, wonderful atmosphere and mystery...","A real page-turner, a character so deep he belongs in those mines, and just beautiful writing. I enjoyed the book, but was so disappointed that I'd figured out the big surprise at the end that that sort of ruined it for me. But I really would recommend the book very highly. The characters were so beautifully developed, the scenery so vivid, I was ""there"". I hated Bill Jaxon and that character went nowhere - that's my only criticism. None of the miners' characters went anywhere, they were sort of superfluous."
5,A wounded hero and an enigmatic heroine in Victorian England,"The book Rose most reminded me of is John Fowles' The French Lieutenant's Woman. Both have troubled heroes and enigmatic heroines, both are set in Victorian England, although Rose's coal-mining town is horrific, and the southern England seacoast settings in FLW are near-idyllic. Smith is a master of clever plotting; he plants red herrings everywhere to lead the reader astray. What IS really going on here! You won't know until the very end, but, along the way, you'll get a quick education in British imperialist/industrialist history and a rare love story. Highly recommended. You know the phrase, ""I couldn't put this down""? You will understand it better after you start reading this little gem of good writing."
2,This is a so-so book,"Since there is no half, I would rate this 2-1/2. The only thing I like about this book is suspense and Blair's character as a smart aleck and his perservance. What I don't like about this book is that it is a slow page-turner especially from the beginning to halfway thru probably because I'm ignorant about the mine stuff. In a small way, I felt like I was reading a literature (I have nothing against literature) or stuff I couldn't comprehend or what's it all about. Four Arkady Renko novels (Gorky Park to Havana Bay) that I have read are a lot better read than this book. I was disappointed this one was not as interested as I thought."
2,Arkady Redux,"Good writing can't hide the fact this is another Arkady Renko novel hidden among the coal mines of England. Same political intrigue, same twists and interpersonal relationships between protagonist and Higher Society. Really, nothing new here at all. But the writing is good, as good as MCS ever is, and the worldbuilding takes you into a little-explored facet of English life ""back in the day.""But it's obvious that the protagonist Blair is just Arkady Renko cloned for a new era.Overall, a good novel if you like Smith. But if you're looking for something new or different from the Arkady plots of old...I'm afraid you will be disappointed."
4,Smith has created engaging characters in an intruiging story,"This was my first Smith novel and what a pleasure it was. I found the characters fascinating and both appealing and appaling. The historical background of its mining town setting was quite interesting. I found ""Rose"" to be both an enjoyable and engaging page-turner."
4,A great read,"I was loath to pick this book up when it came out. ""Rose""?! Please. Stuck with the flu, I had no choice but to pick it up - and I loved it. I've given it another try - and could hardly put it down. Evocative writing and excellent dialog really pull this book along. Is it ""Renko in 1872""? There is perhaps something to that. But, I didn't care. This is a great murder mystery, with fascinating historical background"
5,At Least Two Characters Worth Noting,"I have read this book several times and I still can not figure out who the central character is - the engineer(narrator)or Rose. That is not a fault; it is a plus. The details of description are wonderful. I can feel the grit beneath my feet and the grit on my face. I can almost smell the town of Wigan. And Rose has ""grit!""While it has a ""happy"" ending, it is not a ""happy"" story.""Was England build-ed here; Among these dark, Satanic mills?"""
3,"Another Place, Another Time","I always enjoy a book that takes me to another place and another time, somewhere I've never been or can never go. Smith's Rose is like that, taking us to Victorian Wales--but not the warm fuzzy Wales of Dylan Thomas. This land is every bit as gritty as London's Whitechapel. In this morass of dirty coal fields and hard luck lives Smith's hero, Jonathan Blair, finds a flower in the form of a female coalworker/prostitute who is named Rose. She is enigmatic, and Blair keeps getting sidetracked from his mission to find a missing cleric. Blair, like Smith's other heroes is just short of being truly competent, having to rely on such crusts of information and make- shift deductions as he can, while suffering slanders to his abilities and the inevitable blows to the head. Smith's work always manage to transcend whatever genre in which he is writing, and Rose is no exception. Let a fine storyteller take you to Victorian Wigan, but be sure to duck. It's a dangerous place."
2,This Rose is Blighted...,"I won't reiterate others' comments about the plot-weaknesses (a man who can't recognize his lover when she's cleaned up? Oh, yeah, she ""pinched"" her face up!). I'll just mention the title character...she's appalling, in my opinion. Her self-indulgent masquerade set off a chain of events that resulted in the death of over 70 miners, yet she expresses no remorse or misgivings. She does nothing until the end to stop a miner from stalking and trying to kill Blair. I could go on, but I'll just say ""Rose's"" amorality & selfishness disgusted me. I wish Blair had told her, ""Beat it, sister! I'm tired of being used by you and your dad!"" The book gets 2 stars only because of the historical setting. Oh, and Leveret was a nice character (about the only one)."
3,Plot falls apart on a defective hinge,"Despite the top-notch thriller writing and the Caleb Carr-esque detailed setting, ""Rose"" falls apart on two essential things: one, the solution to the mystery is obvious almost from the moment Blair arrives in town, and two, the plot hinges on an identity question almost as ridiculous as Clark Kent and Superman, that puts Blair in the Lois Lane role. The plot moves quickly and there's plenty of action, but seasoned mystery readers will be way ahead of the author."
3,Certainly not his best,"Although the author did a lot (and I mean that, the detail is excellent) of research for this book, the story is poor and quite frankly boring in places.Unless you really want to read all his books, skip this one and read Polar Star or a later one (which I haven't yet!)"
2,Rose,"All the readers of the book listed who have reviewed are not from England.I am a fan of Martin Cruz Smith's Arkady - 'Russian detective' books, but did not like 'Rose' at all. It was very disappointing. Whilst a lot of research had obviously been done on the workings of the British Coal Industry in the 19th centrury, Martin Cruz Smith's book gave a highly fantistical description of coal mining, and the story line was weak with unconvincing characters, poorly drawn, and unconvincing dialogue as well.I think Martin Cruz Smith should stick to writing detective stories based on the 20th Century, and ideally based in Russia."
5,All the 10's are Right,"There are a lot of 10 reviews on this page and I must agree with them all. For a book to make the top of my list it must have a plot that is intriguing and credible, a cast of characters that are rich and in whom you can not help but invest emotions, a special hook or two to keep you turning pages, historical or scientific information that is new and interesting, and a sorrow when the last page is turned. Rose had them all. A sequel in Africa, please, Martin"
2,Disappointing,"I picked up ""Rose"" after it was highly recommended by a friend. While the details of life in an 1870s English coal-mining town are exceptionally well done, I felt the overall story was flat. In fact, it seems more like Smith wanted to write a story about coal-mining and then had to contrive a plot rather than coming up with a plot and then filling in the details. The disappearance of the town's curate is only a cover for the deeper mystery of Rose herself - but that mystery isn't all that hard to figure out and makes other plot lines seem ridiculous in retrospect. While there's enough of a story here to hold one's interest through to the end, it might be better not to start it in the first place."
3,Contains Spoiler!,"I enjoyed the book's depiction of 19th century life in English mining country, but, as someone else mentioned, Maypole's reason for going down in the mine was totally unconvincing. And I can't buy for a minute that Blair could sleep with a woman so many times and not figure out her identity. Does malaria make one that oblivious?!"
3,"Wonderfully written, but disappointing","Rose is a richly written book with fabulous detail and interesting characters. Unfortunately, the ending was completely unbelievable and very, very disappointing."
5,I Read a Story with Clog Dancing and Mining and Loved It!,"I never thought I'd utter those words, but it's true! Drawn to this novel by Cruz Smith's reputation alone I was instantly (and typically) drawn into another fantastic world I had no idea existed. This world exists in a Welsh mining town in the mid nineteenth century. The details of the people, their work, their addictions, calluses, etc is remarkable. I can actually forgive Mr Smith for his low output because he is obviously doing ungodly amounts of research."
2,Book Club Required Reading,"Had this not been a ""required reading"" for a book club that I belong to, I probably would not have finished it. I remembered trying three times to read ""Gorky Park"" and having difficulty sorting through Mr. Cruz' many characters. I found this book, although not as confusing, overwhelmingly peppered with trivial details, and a plot line so weak that I kept putting it down until the night before our book club met. Can anyone really say that they didn't have this ""surprise ending"" figured out by the time they were half way through reading this novel? Surprising to me was the fact that several members of our group LOVED IT. I don't think they've read enough GREAT books."
4,"Interesting, but it could have been better.","I agree that the writer could have researched a little better. Facts were a bit muddled, but the story was interesting and kept the readers attention. I would read it again, and am glad I bought the book."
5,"Wonderful, mysterious & true events of dead Evita","I was lucky to read this novel while traveling in Argentina. I like strange & mysterious stuff, so I found the events surrounding the corpse of Evita Peron to be magnetic. Truth is stranger than fiction! A great book that everybody should read whether or not they care a fig about Evita - just to open up minds to the wonders of reality. And, yes, Martinez does drag on at times."
4,An informative book,"A very informative and useful book especially for an advanced social psychology or research methodology class. Several videos, easily found online, may be selected for classroom use to compliment this book."
2,very disappointed,"I thought this book is written by Thomas Blass. Actually he only collected miscellaneous writings by some other people. The writings are aimlessly collected without logical connection or lines of reasoning between them.I cannot find a main idea or main ideas from these collected writings, as I usually find from all other books. So I feel confused about why Thomas Blass published this book.Obedience to Authority: Current Perspectives on the Milgram Paradigm"
1,One-sided,"Unfortunately, this is another lop-sided Christian book on loving Israel, or else. Too bad because there is some good stuff in here. But the overall tone is one of fear towards Muslims and blind love towards a state called Israel (NOT the chosen people, those would be ""in Christ"" as Paul clearly states in Romans and Galatians). Tom I love your heart, but not your eschatology.cm"
5,Good Bood,As we were going to go to Israel several months ago this book really was enjoyable. I recommend it to all.A great read.
5,"Compelling, Authoratative and Compassionate","Mr. Doyle has provided a fact-filled book that satisfies those who are politically, socially and/or religiously interested in the situation between Israel and its neighbors. The book is written in such a way that someone with very little knowledge of the history of that part of the world can ""get-up-to-speed"" quickly, but isn't written so simply that a quasi-expert would be non-plussed. There's something for everyone without riding both sides of the fence. He has managed to firmly and skillfully make his case with not only heart and conviction, but with historical and biblical truth on his side. Highly recommend!"
3,Photographic history,"The book is only 4 pages of text. The text is a very quick and very rough history of KG100. The balance of the book is filled with excellent photographs with very good captions.If youre looking for a decent history of pathfinder bomber operations or their equipment, you will not find it with this book. The text is just a short, unsatisfying effort placed at the head of an excellent and seemingly well-captioned collection of photographs."
4,Essential live gig,"This is where Chris Farlowe excels, a small venue with the Norman Beaker Band. This band are still playing with him, when he has spare time from Collossium, in bars and clubs all over Uk and Europe. Tough on me, Tough on you is probably the standout track but no real misses on here. Out of Time is a grittier, stripped down version of his greatest hit."
2,Buy the Jasmine Release,"Full disclosure: I co-produced the Jasmine CD of June Valli.Although many of the same songs appear on both the Flare and Jasmine 2-disc CD sets, the sound quality of the vinyl restoration by Jasmine is far superior. The Flare exhibits bothersome vinyl noise on almost half the tracks. Further, the Jasmine release is less expensive, and includes a 3,000 word liner note interview with James Merchant, June Valli's husband, for a wonderful personal look at the sweet-hearted entertainer."
3,Megastructures Collection contents,"Hi, I'm looking for Dubais's Dream Palace...is it in this collection?? I'd like to buy this product but first, I want to know whats insideThanks"
5,Good Job!,"Interesting, educative, well-produced doco of historically known engineering stuff worldwide.Highly recommended!"
5,great book,Wonderful book. Enplanes Buddhism in easy to understandable terms. There is a great chapter on the subject death which really helped my understanding.
4,A well-written introductory book to modern Buddhism.,"This book is a well-written introduction to Nichiren Buddhism. The book highlights modern Buddhist teachings and principles that hold that you, and only you, are responsible for happiness in your life. The goals of the teachings are personal happiness and world peace through an understanding of self and honest and open dialogue with others. The idea is to find the Buddha nature in yourself (in your mirror) as well as in others. I would encourage all people with an honest and open mind who seek an understanding of what modern Buddhism can be to read this book."
5,An excellent introduction Buddhism,This is one of the most accessible yet comprehensive introduction to Buddhism. It is a great way to help a curious mind actually try for themselves this practice and experience the power of their own Buddha nature.
5,AWESOME!! Nam-myoho-renge-kyo ROCKS!!,"The practice of Nichiren Buddhism as a member of the Soka Gakkai International - USA (SGI-USA)has transformed my life in ways I never thought imaginable!! I am a 33 year-old ex-Catholic and a gay man, practicing what I believe to be the single GREATEST religious experience in the world open to one and all!! NO PRAYER GOES UN-ANSWERED!! Television actor and SGI member, Ron Glass, said it best when he said, ""The SGI is an organization of people who don't like organized religion.""Nam-myoho-renge-kyo ROCKS!! SGI President, Daisaku Ikeda ROCKS!!This is an incredible introduction!!"
4,A Must Read for Musical Theatre & Mystery Enthusiasts Alike,"I must say that, as one who is not normally a reader of mystery, I was wary that this book might not be for me...I am happy to say that I was wrong. So intrigued was I by the 1960's Broadway background that I was easily swept into the story--one that kept and held my attention not only through a series of interesting plot twists and narrator turns, but also stuck with me in such a way that I was still contemplating the story days after I finished. That, I believe, is the sign of a good read. Well done, Mr. Kimmel. The Kritzer books are next on my list!"
5,Mirror,"This was a very good book like all of the other R.L. Stine's. The plot keeps you guessing and is suspensioful. It kept me on my toes and I never wanted to put it down. I have read it about 5 times since it was so good! The chacters are orginal and the events are fantasic. No wonder the series is in the Guiness world records. I strongly suggest this book to anyone and everone, this is a great book to read andhelped me on my way to reading better. Hopefully by now you know that this is a great book and you should at least rent it from your local libary!"
4,Indian Warfare & Army Apache Scouts,"One of the better books to cover the Indian wars (1870's to late1880's) and the Apache in particular. Covers the early history and background as well detailed chapter on Geronimo. It goes in to great detail of the daily living conditions and activates of the period from weapons employment, to cavalry tactics and pack train techniques using period reference material and military manuals. Has a superb chapter on the Apache and their employment by the Army, as guides, scouts and trackers and debunks some of myths of their capabilities. The book has extensive end matter (general and periodical bibliography, index as well one appendix). The appendix on uniforms is extensively plated with diagrams and templates of specifications and standards of uniform fabrication, ideal information for reenactors and historians of the period. Over all I recommend this title to all military readers."
3,O.K. but not great,"This second album by Voodoo Hill is a bit of a disappointment after the great first effort. Its not that the musicianship isn't good; it is... but the band seem to be re-using riffs from the first album. Take ""My Eyes Don't See it"" for example and play it next to ""Sensitive"" from the Voodoo Hill cd; sound familiar? There are a few other riffs that are identical or very close. Glenn Hughes maintains his usual high standard in the vocal department with the exception of ""Soul Protector"" where I thought that he was about to sing the melody line to ""Mellow Yellow"" by Donovan!! complete with Cockney-style accent; not a good thing.I would have loved to have been able to rave about this cd but it is disappointing. Its not a total disaster and becomes better after a few listens but it just isn't memorable. Buy their first effort by all means."
4,If Beethoven was an Animator,"This collection is fun, ugraphically violent, but brutal enough that animators for todays kid's cartoons wouldn't dare attempt ventures such as these. Not only because these toons are too UN-PC for this watered down, wimp generation, but also because this vintage animation required hard work and long hours that have since been delegated to a mouse and a computer program. Hey, America, if you want to create something awesome, get some dirt on your shoes and pain in your hands. (and order this DVD on your trusy computer in the comfort of your own dysfunctional home, he he hah."
2,Wasn't what i thought it would be,I was expecting so much more. It only had two cartoons from Heckle & Jeckle or mighty mouse. Treasure Island was terrible. Throughly disappointed with this purchase!!
3,Maria Movie Star,"Maria finally has her chance to break back into Hollywood,but she has lost her self-confidence."
5,The best anime (in my opinion) !,This show has been my favorite show for such a very long time !& this dvd is my favorite volume !i recommend this show to everyone....you'll enjoy it no matter what.it has a little something for everyone
3,Please Do not list as Young Adult,"I ordered this book for my son only because it was listed in the young adults section. I was not happy when I received the book and it was full of f this, mf this and, s this. Please put in the appropriate category."
4,Buy it for the ACME catalogue alone,"There seem to be numerous visual guides around by these publishers for all kinds of movies and television shows some of which are rather average, but Looney Tunes is a must have. Inside is a substantial amount of information on the major cartoon characters such as Bugs, Daffy, Taz, Sylvester, Yosemite, Wile E as well as minor less known stars such as Torpid Toad, Pete Puma, Cecil Tortoise and Gossamer. Learn that Daffy and Sylvester have the same voice, just that Daffy's is sped up and other interesting facts. The ACME catalogue is a must for any roadrunner chaser and modern movies with the cartoon characters is another interesting section. A must buy for anyone who has ever been a kid and owned a TV."
3,good book,just what I was looking for very glad I got this but too much bs for this review needs less word
5,Happy,This book was better than expected in size and topic. The condition of the book was what was expected for a used book. It was for someone else and they were very pleased with it. Thank you.
2,not for me,"This hat was well made, just not the stle I was looking for. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars"
1,Disappointment of the World's Greatest Sporting Event!,"First, why not make a documentry of the best from ALL of the past Triple Crown's, instead of just one, OK winter?! Also, I can't watch this again because Sunny Garcia makes me ill. He's the most unpleasant person in the entire history of surfing!"
3,"movie is just 'OK""","This movie is mildly entertaining, a few pieces of footage are pretty good, but the majority seems like amateur photography---NOTHING like the Billabong Odyssey, which was jaw dropping incredible. This one is ok if you've already seen the others like Step into Liquid and Billabong--otherwise-- go for Billabong! You won't be disappointed at all, like I was with this Triple Crown of Surfing movie."
2,Don't spend the money,This was a cute book with really great pictures. If you looking for real sales information don't spend the money on this book. You might want to check out How to become a Rainmaker by Jeffrey J. Fox. This is a great book with real information--and no pictures.
1,Sales Dogs Weakest of the series,"Words cannot convey my disappointment with this book. I can appreciate the effort the Rich Dad books put into simplifying the complex subject of becoming rich. Mr. Kiyosaki does a great job of teaching the subject in his books as do the other Rich Dad advisors. I've read all the books and this one is the most disappointing. I feel the author gets carried away with the dog analogy even though I know he's trying to simplify the subject of good selling. He admits to not even owning a dog until he wrote this book. I would have liked to see this book tie in, or reference information in the Rich Dad books. Instead it seems this book was written quickly without thinking it through. I especially didn't like the cheesy illustrations. If you took those out this book would be half the size. Buy it used or check it out from the library. Not worth full price!"
2,Sorry Robert,"I truly enjoyed all of the other Rich Dad Poor Dad books, but this one is awful. I have recommended all of the books to a number of my close friends and family. I will have to warn them all of this book. You know, you can knock them all out of the park though. I still will recommend that everyone should read Rich Dad Poor Dad at the very least."
2,Sales Dogs is for Puppies,Sales Dogs is the most common information on the personality types a sales team will have. The book is geared more toward management of a sales team. Blair Singer took basic sales management and tried to make it interesting by talking about dogs. This would be a good book for a first-year college course on sales management (same material from a first-year sales management textbook). For someone brand new to sales this would be a good start.
2,"A headache to read, nothing but dog analogies","Pages and pages of him never letting up with vague dog analogies, it was incredibly obnoxious and distracted from the point...which when he finally comes around to he explains with more freakin dog analogies. Really terrible writing."
2,Not Good Enough,"It may bring you a little peace of mind knowing that you don't have to be a pushy obnoxiousness sales person to be successful, but it really teaches little abotu being a good sales person. Look into the Gitomer Sales Bible for starters. I have years of sales experience... trust me."
2,Ehh... I could do without,"I could have done without reading this book. It simply stated the obvious again and again, and provided nothing substantial that I will take away and use. Here let me save you some $$$ and tell you what I got from the book: People are different and have different ways of selling according to their personalities. Groundbreaking huh!"
2,If you must read it - borrow it.,"I am a fan of Robert Kiyosaki's books and follow his Rich Dad's Advisors series. However, I believe that ""Sales Dogs"" is not up to quality with the rest of his books. It is slightly amusing as is, using dog breeds to describe different types of sales approaches, but has very little advice on how to actually develop salesmanship qualities - something that Robert Kiyosaki highly advises in all of his books.I read to Chapter 7 and just could not justify wasting anymore time on something that seemed to rehash the sales dog breed qualities over and over. I skimmed through the rest. If everything of importance in this book were severely edited down it would probably take up no more than a chapter.Zig Ziglar is much more informative and gives more bang for the buck in any one chapter in any one of his books compared to the whole of Sales Dogs when it comes to giving practical sales advice."
2,Good book,I wasn't as impressed with this book as I was with others in the series. It had way too many cartoons and not enough good advice.
2,Not What I Was Hoping For!,"I have enjoyed (and benefited from) the Rich Dad, Poor Dad series of books, as well as the advisory series... this book, however, did not cut it. The Dog analogy goes so far over the top it loses its value; the repetition of basic points gives no depth (and therefore reduced value) to the topic of sales and generally speaking it is a boring read and does not leave you with a toolkit to be used upon completion of the book.Overall, a very big disappointment. My suggestion, look elsewhere for information on Sales!"
1,Worst,Disappointed again. Surely he sells books - lots of them. But he probably ran out of stories. Not worth the money.
2,Disappointing,"I enjoyed reading Rich Dad Poor Dad, Cashflow Quadrant, and the Guide to Investing, but this book does not measure up. The book repeats itself quite a bit, and although the Dog analogy is somewhat appropriate, it really gets carried away to the point of being distracting. I agree that Sales is very important to the success of a businessperson, but I don't see this book enhancing a person's sales knowledge or ability."
2,DO NOT BUY,"Did you read that heading? It is a waste of money considering that there are SO MANY more worthwhile books on sales. I have loved the Robert Kiyosaki books, but so far, I have found the Advisor series seriously lacking. This book MAY be for nobody; too simple and gimmicky for people experienced in sales, and too jargony and managerial for those just beginning."
3,Not titanium,Just received the watch and it looks great;however it has no titanium as advertised. I am replaceing a Seiko Titanium watch that I own and this watch is much heavier. The back of the watch indicates 5 Bar Stainless Steel construction. Nothing in the package indicates titanium. I will return it for a lighter titanium one.
5,Great Watch,This is very attractive watch at a great price. I get many compliments on it every day.I I I
5,Nice Seiko!,This is my 3rd Seiko watch and it's a beauty! The black finish is shinier than in the picture and the face is well detailed and easy to read. I use this watch for dress or casual wear and have had several compliments on it.
5,Decent Watch,This is a decent watch and looks very nice on my wrist. It is not titanium (as noted in other review) but still very good watch. I found it on amazon for $120 and is definitely recommendable for that price. You really cant get decent Seiko for that price.
3,Short on words.,"This is one of very few books that covers cord progressions and typical rythms found in music. However, the book is almost completely free of explanations. It is just a collection of short scores that demonstrate a principle in each chapter. The principle that is being demonstrated is not explained. It is possible but difficult to work out the point of each chapter for yourself. The book is not really appropriate for self-study."
4,Good Book,"The reviews above are clearly inadequate. Judging by the fifth edition, this is an excellent and comprehensive book. Though it is best designed for teachers, it can be used by someone with a talent for persistent self-study."
3,not all there!,"the book arrived on time, but when i received it i realize the back was ripped off. its not a huge deal, but kind of frustrating for the money i spent on it."
4,Ultraman Rocks!!,"I just remember as a little boy, running home and turning on Ultraman. This video allows me to re-live those ""Good 'ole days"". This video is now a classic, and rare since all the episodes will not be seen in reruns, because they were all shipped back to Japan. A must own for all Ultraman collectors!"
1,H--- Verbosity!,"200+ pages of inner thoughts and people mumbling to themselves (a tiresome affectation after a while) and rambling paragraphs meaningless to the crime or even to setting the scene (interesting in itself, giving a hint as to what Melbourne was like in the 18--'s) -- it also uses the tiresome habit of using dashes for dates and some ""swear words"" like ""why in G--'s name"" and ""D--- it, sir!"". This might reflect the sensitivities of the reading public of the day, but is boring now. The big secret on which the plot hinges might have been realistic in the 18--'s, but wouldn't even cause a blink of the eye on today's soap operas. The book is way too long and I skimmed a lot of it after realizing it wasn't going anywhere for many pages. It's okay for those interested in writings of the time, but not for those looking for a well written and plotted mystery to read for entertainment."
4,Works great,"Sizes may run a little small , but is great. Not as much moisture wicking as expected, but is fine at it all the same."
3,sizes are alittle wonky,"Well i already knew the materials were cheap so wasent shocked by that but i bought this shirt for a friend and shes very slight i thought a adult medium would be good for her but its way too big its even alittle big and way long for me and i wear an XL and im 5 inches taller than her (im 5,8) so its for the most part what i expected but if your a smallish person you should probably buy a youth size."
2,pooooor quality,"this looks good on the ad but once i got it , the fabric cant be thinner and not well sewed"
5,Exactly what we were looking for,My daughter had gotten these shirts through her school years ago and always wanted more of them. Our order came promptly and the shirts are exactly as expected.
2,Not as pictured,"The baseball jersey I received has a different collar than the one pictured. It's much bigger & looks like it was designed for overweight players, though the rest of it fits like a standard medium. The collar pictured is way better looking. Smaller neckbands are better because they always get stretched out of shape anyway, & the bigger collar will soon get too loose & look weird. The fabric is very thin, but it would be good on hot days. Also, the grey is considerably darker than pictured. I couldn't recommend it since the collar looks sort of dorky & besides, I really don't like it when you don't receive what was pictured."
3,Didnt fit good . Not comfortable at all.,I didnt like the tops at all. Size wasnt good. I ordered 3 of the .tops and I returned all 3 of them .The tops are very light materials.Im still looking for blank baseball tops.
3,Meh,The collar is uncomfortably tight around the neck and shirt material is really thin and breezy. If I had known it was gonna choke me...
4,Euro cheese at it's best,"A definite buy for all Eurovision fanatics though not really for newcomers to the genre.Includes some of the cheesiest tunes from across Europe. My current favourite being ""Eres tu"" by Mocedades, a song I had never heard until playing this CD.Enjoy!!"
1,What a crock,These Ram's Pants are from the 8 or 9 years ago and have the tag Los angels Rams on the back. and they had a small light stain on them. Very embarassing as they were a gift
1,Poor Shipping Practice,"I received the Allen Key set in a reasonable time, but it was shipped in a USPS envelope and not protected. The key set case was taped shut and when I opened the envelope, the tape was the only thing keeping it together. The case was broken and one of the hinged was broken off. I received a call from the shipper asking me to take down the negative review and they would send me another case. It's been 2 weeks and no case. Don't trust these people. When a company tells you they will do something and doesn't what does that say about the company?http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X3K0U/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
2,Won't help with your business plan,"Lets start with the good. Its broad and thorough, covering a range of topics.If you are looking for a way to understand the basic (I underscore BASIC) economics of EC then this could be for you.If you are in the business already, and looking to get some depth to your fundemental understanding of how to make money in EC, lets say for a business plan.. You should look somewhere else.The book covers very elementary topics, and is not appropriate unless you are an undergraduate (e.g. what is a digital certificate, what are the economies of scale in software).My feedback to the authors would be to take some real business models and include them as case studies. Of course since there are so few companies in the black, perhaps that would just scare off all the folks that read it from starting a business :-)"
4,Good overview of the business economics of e-commerce,"The book provides some new insights and useful models for both the student and the business person. A little superficial in some of the most exciting areas like virtual processes (process re-engineering based on electronic tools and enablers). Nonetheless, some good solid basics are to be found."
5,FINALLY dj BOTS becomes a dragon ash member.LET'S ROCK!!!!!!,"What a song!one of d.a's biggest songs in Japan.the first d.a single to have dj bot's as an offical d.a member.It's a VERY relaxed hip hop song that you won't of heard anything like it before.if you ever see the video you'll see the coolest person ever! KENJI/KJ (d.a's head).The b-sides are ace too.one thing you'll find out is that their b-sides are AWESOME.let yourself go,let myself go & humaity are both from viva la revolution (humanity is a very different version & let yourself go,let my self go has a different intro.....believe me it will matter when you become obsessed).M is a super peaceful track that will have you day dreaming in no time."
5,Rock and rap in perfect harmony,"Like one of the previous reviewers, I became an instant Dragon Ash fan after hearing the beginning of this song. This song is cool beyond words. I think Kenji's rap style and voice is really mellow and soothing on this track, and on 'M.' There is also the original version of humanity and a short rock instrumental. In short, this is a classic CD. Get it!"
2,April Flowers is the only reason to endure this mess.,"There are two hot girls in this movie. Both get naked. One in an o.k. shower scene that kept getting interrupted by pointless non-shower scenes of people running around in the woods with their clothes on. She also has her hair up; I didn't care for that too much.April Flowers, by far the hotter of the two hot chicks gets naked in a much better sex scene that is also rudely interrupted by scenes of people standing around in the dark fully clothed.If you do insist on watching this steamer then check out the deleted scene cause it's a nude one featuring Julie K. Smith, of all people, in a bathtub with two other naked females. Not really hot cause they talk a lot, but it's always nice seeing Julie.Nikki Fritz also has a small non-nude scene.D: Jim Wynorski (CHOPPING MALL, DEATHSTALKER II)April Flowers (THE MUMMY'S KISS, EMBRACE THE DARKNESS II)Julie K. Smith (THE DALLAS CONNECTION, DAY OF THE WARRIOR)Nikki Fritz (BIKINI DRIVE-IN, DINOSAUR ISLAND)"
4,bring on the hot cheerleaders,"i have to admit i'm a big fan of the low budget massacre movies, slumber party massacre, sorority house masscare, and now cheerleader massacre. talk about hot babes, wish our cheerleader squad looked like that in school, little to good to be true. anyways plenty of nudity and plenty of victims. great low budget movie to watch with friends, had some pretty funny scenes as well. all in all a great low budget movie."
2,not bad for a slasher movie,"The plot is ok, there are nudity but not many though. The way the victims died wasnt horrifying at all. I guess my expectation was a little higher.The lovemaking scenes was not erotic though. If u r thinking of buying this movie is best that u might want to skip this one."
5,HOTTIES!,"This is well worth buying for the nudity alone! Who cares how cheaply made this movie was! If you want naked babes this should be on the top of your ""buy"" list. Just don't forget about the deleted scene in the special features."
5,Standing next to him,"As a real fan the choice of songs for this live album didn't make me jump for joy. Most songs are really well known and therefore most interesting to me were the French version of ""If I were a richman"" (Ah, si j'étais riche) and the black spiritual song ""Nobody knows the trouble I've seen"", which I had never found on any CD before. But after listening more carefully to the album, I knew it was really good. Not only is the music often quite different than on album versions, but I love the words he speaks before he starts a song. It makes you feel more close to the warmth of the person called Ivan Rebroff and you realise that singing on stage in front of his audience means the world to him. We love to hear him, he loves to be heard."
4,WELL-WRITTEN AND BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED,"This well-written and beautifully illustrated textbook was designed for medical students. It is comprehensive: with each chapter sectioned into technical, anatomical and pathological sub-headings.""Clinical Radiology: The Essentials"" embraced all aspects of diagnostic and interventional imaging techniques currently in use. It is a general mini-reference text whose aim is to provide students with all the tutorials that they may need during revision.Still, experienced radiologists would appreciate its concise outlook, which makes it an ideal memory-refreshing tool."
3,read a while and say goodnight,"Radiology is enriched by this summarizing book in a more or less satisfying manner. In my opinion, the author has found an average compromise between textbook and atlas of radiological pathology. Although you will find many good figures of typical laesions, it may happen that you have to search for them for a little while, because this book is lacking a conceice content of figures. If one was a bloody beginner in radiology, a more detailed description of normal findings would have been helpful. Nevertheless, if you are interested in reading and looking a couple of time when nothing else is to do that night, you can never be wrong with that book. Moreover, the price is fair in comparison to similar books even appeared at LWW."
5,"another range of music that only ""IVAN THE GOOD""can handle","It took a few plays and i am not alone to say that it is one of the best.Maybe it is because we are so use to russian melodia,or opera from this great singer,i do not know for sure but this music works for him.At first play my opinion was different but now i have to say this is a great ""LITTLE""album.Hopefully a part 2 will emerge."
4,Correcting information,"The CD album title is actually ""You Can Be Anyone This Time Around"" (not ""Anything"").Also, the tracklist here doesn't display the right order of tracks, here's the right info:1. Live and Let Live (13:56)(Timothy Leary: rap; Stephen Stills: guitar; John Sebastian: guitar; Jimi Hendrix: bass; Buddy Miles: drums)2. You Can Be Anyone This Time Around (9:03)3. What Do You Turn On When You Turn On (6:03)"
5,Live and let live,"One of the greatest Albums around---- its a trip man, be ready to be blown away for a real good time. Remember the name of the game is to feel real good."
1,Simply awful,"I suppose some might consider this album interesting from a historical perspective. If you're heavily stoned, it might be entertaining. Otherwise it's just awful. The music sounds like a porn soundtrack. Even at that, it's ruined by Leary's nonsensical blattering in the background."
4,This is a good cd,"THIS CD LETS YOU INTO THE MIND OF A MAN WHO CAHGED THE 60's AND LET ME TELL YOU THIS WAS A VERY SMART MAN, AND WHEN YOU HEAR THIS IT IS GOING TO MAKE YOU THINK ALOT CAUSE THAT WHAT IT DID TO ME. CAUSE HE KNEW HOW TO USE WORDS IN A WAY THAT YOU HAD TO LISTEN AND JUST TO HEAR IS VOICE SHOWS YOU HOW MUCH OF A GOOD SPOKES MEN HE WAS AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TELL WHY SO MANY PEOPLE TRUSTED HIM, AND THE MUSIC IS SO GOOD THE WAY IT ALL JUST FITS TOGETHER TO MAKE A GREAT SOUND. SO GET THIS CD AND YOU WILL LOVE THAT YOU DID."
5,Graet product,"Item is as described, fast freight and easy to to deal with. This seiko watch is just what I wanted and ordered, highly recommmended"
2,had to fix,"When I ordered this product it was listed on Amazon as ""in stock""-it took three weeks to arrive. The first time I used the brush the barrel was loose and I could not figure out why-until it completely came off!!! Instead of going through the hassle of returning it and waiting who knows how long for a replacement, I used Gorilla Glue to put the barrel back on the handle-and now it works fine. So...I like the brush but it took a little effort!"
5,"Practical, good tools for investing",Frank Yao and team have done a good job giving individual investors clear simple tools to make better investment decisions. The authors demonstrate a strong grasp of financial theory and practical experience investing. I thought the book was user-friendly without oversimplifying what investors should know to make better investment decisions about their entire portfolio. A timely and well-written book.
5,A must read for today's investor,This is an excellent intro to the concepts of modern portfolio management. It is vital for today's investor to understand that he needs to take a portfolio view when making investment decisions and understand how the portfolio's assets are inter-related to each other. He must also realize that understanding how much you can lose is as important as understanding how much you can gain. This book clearly and effectively illustrates these and many more fundamental concepts that every successful investor should know. It's a great read.
4,an awesome manga,"This is a really good manga. Its pretty much a shojo thing, but its really cute, I loved it. But the only problem was the fact that they changed the gender of some of the characters. Like Kohaku, an angel, who was originally a guy was changed into a girl, cause he falls in love with another guy. I like to think it as, angels have no gender, so it doesn't matter, so yeah. But anyways this is a really good anime!! So if you don't mind the gender switching, buy it!!"
4,Didn't interest me at first,"Wish is a story about a man, Suichiro, who one night saves an angel from a tree. The angel, who is called Kohaku, insists on repaying him with one wish. Suichiro insists that he dosen't have anything to wish for. So Kohaku decides to stay with him intil he decides what he will wish for.When I first heard about Wish, I liked the plot and wanted to read it. So I bought volume 1. When I finished volume one soon after, I didn't want to continue the series because it didn't keep me hooked enough. Some parts in the volume were kind of boring. But then, later, I re-read it, and got back into it. Probably because I wanted to know what Suichiro's wish was going to be (for he didn't make a wish yet in volume 1).Wish is a very cute and touching series. I recommend it to shojo and CLAMP fans. It's only 4 volumes long, so you won't be busting your wallet to get the books. I hope this review helped you and that you try reading Wish!"
5,What would you think if you found an angel?,"Shuichiro Kudo is walking along, minding his own business, when he ends up saving a tiny angel, a tiny angel stuck in a tree being attacked by a crow. Is she real? How can something that small have SUCH a huge head? Anyway, after saving her she offers to give him a wish. The problem is that he does not WANT one. His life is OK, his work is going well, he has no money problems and he believes in fulfilling his own dreams!What can an angel do? Well, Kohaku (that's the angel's name) decides that the best thing to do is hang around and help him till he DOES think of a wish she can grant.Can some wishes be fulfilled alone or do you sometimes need help?If you didn't need help...why bother to fall in love?"
1,"Bleck, sorry clamp","In genaral I absolutely adore Clamp, I've read Rayearth, chobits, cardcaptor, angelic layer, clover, and a couple more so when I heard that clamp had a new realease i was all a twitter so i went out and bought it, and what a waste of money it was. First off the chatracters are horribly drawn expessically for clamp secodn off the plot sort of plods along and gets absolutely no where. The characters arn't loveable like Chi from chobits, in fact there isn't a single character i like in the whole book! So if your're loooking for interersting manga I would try chobits of angelic layer, these two are good and tightly ploted."
3,kind of boring...,"Okay, okay, I admit it...it is undeniably cute. But I just didn't really adore this manga. CLAMP is one of the best manga teams out there, but this story just didn't grab me like some of the others did. it's really kind of boring...with some plot twists and many Awwwwwwwwwww...moments. The ending of the first volume was like...whoa."
4,Alas! a bishonnen becomes a bishoujo!,"A lovely story, with lovely CLAMPerific art. Americans no Baka desu! it is a great manga but before you buy it you should know that the translators changed Kohaku's gender to avoid a shounnen-ai (Guy on Guy) relationship that was the story's soul. as long as you change all of the shes to hes you'll love it!"
1,YEAH! Wish I never read it!,"The artwork is lacking emotion, feeling and talent. It was just shabby. The plot is terrible. No real thought was put into it. It looks as if they tried too hard, way too hard to make the lead character seem and act sugary cute. I could not related to any of the characters. I didn't find any of the main characters at all interesting.I love Chobits, and X. I am very fond of Clamp. But this series, I can do without. It was just an empty shell of a story. It had so many wonderful possiblies. It was very disappointing."
1,This book is awful.,"I bought this book for my intermediate stats class and in summary, it was close to useless. The writers of this book make the information in this book so difficult to understand that it is nearly impossible to learn from. The technical language in this book is in no way made for students and barely even for statisticians. Refrain from buying this book unless its truly necessary."
2,Poorly organized and poorly printed,"Parts of this book read like first drafts. Ideas are confusingly organized and the topics themselves are mixed up and difficult to find again when reviewing. Perhaps the worst feature if the awful typeface and printing which makes it often difficult to tell what a word is or whether a subscript is a '1', an 'i' or a 'j'. (This was not only true for my copy.) The binding is terrible and the spine disintegrated after a few weeks of use."
2,Ugh...,"Not so good. As a mathematician, I found the lack of rigor in the book to be disappointing. I mean, sure, it was written for psychology students who probably have never taken a course above algebra, but come on, you can't introduce things as ""AMAZING facts"" and then not show where they come from. Would it kill you to write maybe a little calculus? I had Professor Glenberg for this class and I asked him a question about how one of the formulae was derived and he said he didn't know (remember, he wrote the book). It took him 2 days to figure out that all you had to do was take the derivative of a previous formula. Wow. Sorry, but it was just a bad experience."
4,Very informative on all aspects of Pennsylvania,"Sine I bought the atlas some years ago, I found it very useful in finding info on aspects of Pennsylvania such as geography, history, population, and economic data.A must have for anyone doing research on Pennsylvania whether for school or personal use."
1,This is terrible,"I was so disappointed. Horrible. Not even what I would consider music and these people are not musicians. I have listened to it over and over hoping I am missing something, but I am not. It sucks. It sounds like some friends got together and decided to make an album and did so in one night. I wish I could get my money back. The other reveiws that were written were very misleading. I bought this piece of crap because of all the five-star rave reveiws. I will not be so gulible next time.By the way, I love groups The Shins, Arctic Monkeys, Decemberists, Beck, etc. if this helps anyone."
5,movie music compilation,as always Erich Kunzel captures the heart of the music. A must for those who enjoy the late composer.
4,Yankee Speak Reviewed by a Yankee,"After reading this book, I was left a little confused. I am from Massachusetts, and have traveled extensively through New England, but some of these things I have never heard! Even so, I've found myself using many of these terms and pronunciations. Overall, it's a great book with a great deal of history. Off to pawk my caw in the Hawvawd Yawd next to a bucket, and eat t'other grinder..."
4,Don't read it alone in bed on a stormy night,"Into the Forest is a disturbing look into the tortured soul of a man haunted by his past. He, is drawn into deeper evils that suck him ever deeper and deeper, not releasing him - or we readers - till the very last page. Based on a true-life triple homicide in Ireland in 1994, O'Brien's tale takes us into the hunted and haunted mind of O'Kane, the murderer. This story deals with acts of naked violence and is not for the faint of heart. No sunny conclusion, either."
1,This thing sucks,I made the mistake in buying this POS! It will break and co2 will come flying out and the coil will flail around. Do not buy mirco anything. Get the thick big remote coil that can handle the PSI. This thing is a safety hazard. Do not buy it. I was playing paintball and they thing snapped because it was so thin. Co2 was coming out of my tank. It sucks. Spend $40 on a good one.
2,Waste of money,"THis product is garbage. The second time I played, the remote coil started to leek. To sum it all up, the coil is simply garbage."
4,Must read for any Baan library.,"I have had the pleasure of assisting the implementations of Baan products at several companies in he United States. My background with Baan starts with a very old version 2.0. startup at a Mining and Manufacturing company, to a recent ERP install. All the versions in between. This user manual takes a solid walk through the basics, through tools, and implementation guidance. I recommend this Baan bible for anyone having responsibility to install, parallel, and migrate to ERP Solutions in their business."
2,Left me feeling empty,"I enjoyed the characters in this book and there were even some interesting plot developments, but about half way through it stopped going anywhere. I have NOT read the Biggie books so don't have a good comparison, but I have to admit that this book sure didn't make me want to read more by this author. I found the end very unsatisfactory - it was almost like about half way through the book she lost interest and just finished it up as quickly as possible, without much thought."
2,Not enough instructions,A very short c/d does not give me enough information or instructions as to how different cutting tools perform etc.I guess I'm just to old to be dealing with this at my age I will be sending it back asap
1,VERY Short Battery Life,Guess you get what you pay for... These batteries have such a very short usage life span. Will not ever purchase again!
1,Useless piece of junk,Dont get this. It is a piece of junk which will not last you even a few days of light use.
3,This product is Universal!,"This product is. A source of power, placed upon cardboard and sealed by plastic packaging. The cardboard has letters on it that adequately describe the function of the product. The picture of a globe on the packaging truly reinforces the idea that the product is ""universal"", as indicated by this word printed on the cardboard. If you are looking for a product such as this, then you've found what you're looking for. AAA - Highly recommended."
1,DOA,"The batteries were bought as a filler to get free shipping.They arrived,as the title says, DOA. Would you replace them with working batteries?Thank youMark M. Feinstein"
4,Some really good craft ideas,"This book contains some great craft ideas that do not need many items to create. It would be suitable for teenagers to do buy themselves, and 10+ with some help.The book contains some cards, picture frames, present wrapping ideas as well as some paper Mache projects. The origami section is okay, it contains some good models in the advanced section (Seal on a Rock, Electra modular star & Chinese vase), but the diagrams are not very clear."
1,a waste of my time,"I ordered via Amazon. Upon its arrival, I could not get the DVD to work. I tried it on 2 different DVD players. I set it back for a replacement which also did not work. I'm not sure if this DVD is Blu Ray as it didn't indicate if it is. I'll now be sending the 2nd one back. What a waste of my valuable time. I will simply purchase something else."
1,Re-enactment home movie,What a waste of time. The four videos consist of war re-enactments with a tiny amount of voice-over explanation of the battle. We see endless shots of re-enactors firing their weapons. Over and over.I rate this five stars for the handful of re-enactors who are featured; they get a well-made home movie. One star for the rest of us who want to learn something about American Revolutionary War battles.A total waste of time and money.
3,"neither live, nor the groundhogs","this is a solo album by tony. he recorded it in his basement, with him also playing bass (pete chymon annagram for tony mcphee)and a drum machine. the live crowd noise was over dubbed. this information is from the liner notes of ""high on the hog"" cd. still a good cd though."
4,Overall a good album,"I agree with 'Jo' from Melbourne, this album ""takes some listening to get used to"".I generally like rock music but it took a while for me to warm up to this CD, even though I'd heard music by Grignani before.I kept the album because the songs have depth (meaning), and I remembered Jo's review. So, although I found some songs not to my taste, with constant playing eventually my ears accepted Grignani's style. I've decided it's a gem.I'd describe this cd's musical style as 'acoustic rock', it's laid back, yet intense and introspective. Overall it's a very good album. I recommend it."
5,Ottima! Sei propio carino Gianluca.,Se sara possibile di conoscerti sara sicuramente il mio giorno perfetto
2,Many mistakes and a lot fo material missing,"After taking the practice test and going through the book, I found a lot of material to be missing. And the material that is goes through, it provides over complicated explanation that you will never need to know. Not to mention so many mistakes and typos that it almost offends me and I got this book for free.If you are looking to study for Chem GRE, find another resource. If this book is one of many others then its ok."
1,GRE Chemistry Study Book,"This product was descent for a study manual, but when it arrived it looked as though it had been in someone's car trunck for years."
3,"Good place to start, but shouldn't be your only resource","While I have been impressed with the Princeton Review materials before, their chemistry review book is a bit lacking. This would be a good book to go through maybe a month or two before the exam, but for GRE studying, the most helpful resources are always practice exams, and the one with this book is definitely much easier than the real thing."
2,Was not very useful in 2008 and appears to be even much less so today,"This test-prep text provided a reasonable overview of organic chemistry but was useless for all other topics of chemistry. I'd achieved a high percentile on the chemistry gre exam in the fall of 2008, but I can give no due credit to this print. Do not waste your time here.."
2,OK,"This book is an okay start. It has less mistakes in it than the older edition, but there are still some. It is definitely not enough preparation though."
1,"Absolutely aweful, shameful ripoff","Many people have complained, but I just needed to add my name to the list.[..]. Errors on nearly every page, not joking, not exaggerating. I have been out of school for years, so I really needed a good refresher, and this book couldn't have made the studying a more aggravating experience.[..]DO NOT USE THE STUDY SECTIONS! You will likely want to murder yourself if you do. If you value your time, and want to do well, only use this test for the couple pages that are worth anything; do the practice test ONLY. [..]Also, try to find it used, I hate to think that this company is making money. A sin. It goes to show that there is money to be made in writing another book like this, no matter what you will make money off of it, even if the pages were written [..]"
1,The bar is pretty low for review books to begin with,"Yes, I used it, and yes, it was nice to have a review. But it was full of typos. Important ones-- like the ones that totally change the equations they want you to memorize. Furthermore, it contains information that is just wrong (a reaction is NOT spontaneous, despite negative change in free energy, because of a high activation energy?). Low, low quality like this is unacceptable."
2,Buy the Mankiw if you can!,"This book has been a struggle to understand since the beginning. The explainations and definitions are described as if the author doesn't want you to comprehend the full meaning of the concepts. The examples are also terrible, it's like he's not trying to help us. Compared to the N. Gregory Mankiw book, this textbook is a bore."
2,"I want to love this, but beauty's not all I need!","Simply put, yes, they are beautiful... but no, they aren't good for drinking in general. I have tried 8 varieties... and they were all very bland and musty tasting...If ALL you want is an expensive but still natural decoration, while I'd personally buy a flower... this is intriguing, sure... but ultimately, who wants to pay a small fortune for weak, bleak tea?!?"
4,Nearly a brilliant album,"This album shows off Hiro's range from upbeat pop tunes such as Bright Daylight to the R&B sound of As Time Goes By to mellow songs such as Treasure. Though the album does tends to lean more towards an R&B sound that is heavily influenced by western music. I really liked this album even though I don't understand a word of the catchy lyrics. But I'm sure that understanding the lyrics can create an even a greater sense of appreciation of Hiro's work. If you're a fan of SPEED, I highly recommend this album."
3,Brilliant - Hiro,Great first album for ex-Speed member Hiro. Songs featured are of easy listening and pop. Sounds more like a teenage girl telling her story about her first love.
5,Shave,"I can't find this product locally, and I can't use a razor. I have been shaving with this product for over40 years,"
3,The good part is it's the book of Acts word for word with many parts acted out.,Some parts could have been more meaningful had they been acted out rather than just narrated such as when Stephen was stoned his face shone when he could look up and see Jesus. Also when Peter had the vision of the unclean animals being lowerd on a sheet to prove what God makes is clean. Signaling That the Good News is for the Jew and the Gentiles. But most parts were acted out. It is a good teaching video
5,A Superb Rant!!!,"Is there a bigger literary crime than the fact that so few read William Gaddis? Before his death in December '98, he may have been the best living American Author. Think of a slghtly more serious, but equally wicked Thomas Pynchon. Carpenter's Gothic is a tense, dense, explosive, beautiful, hilarious, acerbic and taut work of genius. Gaddis' ear for dialogue is frightening. He has few equals. His prose is Faulkner, Hawthorne, Joyce, Beckett - and nasty. Great satire here, targets being American everything, especially fundamentalist religion, foreign policy, and the media... This is easily his most accessible novel. WARNING: not for sensitive Christians!"
3,Worth a look,"I read it a long time ago, and some of the dialogue has stuck with me, but overall there's an emptiness of vision underlying this work. Whether or not the book satirizes Christianity or fundamentalism is hard to say; if it does, it doesn't try very hard. One character rants against the language of evangelization, but that character turns out to be a venal, self-obsessed murderer. What does that say about his opinions? In fact, one irony is the work may implicate readers who agree with the anti-Christian diatribes ... but I'm not sure. At least the book's short and some of it is memorable."
3,Like a Creative Writing Student Aping the Real Gaddis,"After having read A Frolic of His Own, this one came as a real disappointment. Sure he skewers American culture but doesn't he take his potshots at some easy targets? The typical Gaddis dialogue is used to very little purpose here and I don't think the characters are at all as well developed as in Frolic. Maybe this book isn't long enough. Frolic, JR and Recognitions are all epics. It seems like he tossed this one of in a week or so to fulfill a contract. It's a good book but Gaddis can do this in his sleep.Read A Frolic of His Own instead. There he turns the legal profession inside out rather than scoring easy points against obvious targets like Southern preachers and big corporations."
3,Not his best work,"It says nothing he didn't say better in JR, which though somewhat less accessible, is a richer, funnier and satisfying novel. The writing is dazzling, though it becomes somewhat monotonous at points in this book. (Get your own ice, Paul.) The problem is the content. At its core, this book is pretty empty. Carpenter's Gothic and, to a lesser extent, JR are like some Wynton Marsalis solos. The artist may be able to hit notes and play riffs no one else can and his tone may be gorgeous, but the music doesn't say anything. Still, worth three stars for the brilliance of the technique."
2,Poor Durability,"I got one of these Belkin Sports Armbands for my Samsung K3, and I'm sorry to report that the seam on the side split after just a few months of use. In addition, the velcro stuff used here is unusually grabby, making it difficult to unfasten the band quickly. K3 fans would do better with the silicone case amazon also offers with a detachable armband. In that unit, the case stays on the K3, so I reckon it will prove more durable than the Belkin, and the velcro on its armband fastener is more accommodating than on the Belkin."
5,Great,"Arrived in one piece, which is a task all in itself seeing as it had to travel all the way to Alaska! Looks just as pictured."
5,Happy Daughter-in-law!!,I purchased this item as a gift for my mother-in-law for Christmas. I was very excited for it to arrive and it arrived very promptly! I was very happy with the product and it was very well made! The glass is thick enough to keep from breaking easily and the bulbs inside are beautiful! Thank you for a wonderful product!
5,Great for exposure to sign language and colors!!!!!,My daughter loves them! She chooses them over Baby Einstein!! I am so glad there is something for toddlers that teaches them the Bible along with learning their world!!
5,mock turtleneck,I was unable to locate this sweater in any of my area malls. Amazon came through once again and at a GREAT price.
4,Nice turtleneck,"It is a little brighter of a yellow than what shows on the screen. I can make due but I expected a buttery mello yellow than bright yellow. I can make due because it is a nice turtleneck. Sizes run a little big. I usually get a large in most shirts but after I read the reviews, I bought a medium. I am glad I did. I would have been swimming in a large. These turtlenecks are not too loose and not too long. I can still tuck it in easily."
2,Neck Doesn't Look Right,"This turtleneck would have been given 5 stars except that the mock turtleneck look does not maintain its shape when pulled over the head, and looks awkward and disheveled, and there seems no way to correct it. To make matters worse, washing the shirt does not return the neck to its original shape. Other than this (which I consider crucial to the look of the shirt), the material is soft and the rest of the shirt maintains its shape. The color is just as it appears in the ad. The sizing is accurate, and it is a very comfortable shirt. I just wish someone would create a mock turtleneck that retained its shape when pulled over the head. It's really a shame."
1,not as durable as indicated,"this push button was warrantied for 90 days.after about 100 days, it broke with very light use.too much plastic and cheap metal contacts make this push button switch extremely extremely light duty."
1,I paid 20 dollars for this?,"I was disgusted when I installed this product. I paid 20 dollars for something so cheap?I have gone through two of them in a 2 years in a car that has gone 400 miles at best!You have to push the button so hard to get it to work, and in doing so are obviously damaging the weak internal parts. Also its so cheap looking(not that many things arent these days) but definitely dont buy this to use with a car with a nice interior. I rebuilt the switch inside mine and textured the exterior and it looks much better.If your gonna spend this much on a switch dont buy this one."
3,not as good as some,"I normally love anything by Tomie dePaola. I felt that as usual, the illustrations were great. The story, however, was a little confusing to the children as I read it to them. Was the boy naughty? Was he making okay choices? Why was he so happy at the end after he had had to apologise for stealing the show? It made the students think that maybe it was okay to be a ham and steal someone else's thunder. Woops!"
1,Very poor salestrick,"Monkey Punch Girls Trading Figures Collection SetUsing a picture with 6 figures and only selling 5 of them is not fair. Before ordering i went through a few different sites that would acuatilly sell theese figures. But only tisinc had all 6 figures! (at least on the picture) But only 5 figures shoved up at delevery. I wrote them an email, explaining the problem. More than one month later i still havent heard from them.Very bad salesmansship"
4,Non-Stop Boisterous Cacophany,I chose this Rating because it was a Good Mix of all Elements leading to an enjoyable movie for Mature Audiences.The only Thing Missing was a Continuous Storyline. All in all a Good See !!
3,"Luscious Cristina, Gorgeous Gabriel","Don't pay attention to references about Cristina Ricci's lush curves. She looks healthy. But the only reason to watch this movie whatsoever, unless you like Ricci, Timothy Olyphant or Lolita Davidovitch, is to drink in the stunning beauty of Gabriel Mann. He doesn't come anywhere close to his brilliant performance in Parallel Sons, but the camera loves this boy's face and that's enough for me. I think it's clear the actors had minimal direction and guidance from the director, and pretty much hammed it up. And that's always a fun thing to watch, when a disciplined, methodical actor basically directs him or herself. Their perfomances are usually pretty unlimited. Anyway, there's at least one extreme close-up of Gabriel Mann that made me hit the pause button. A couple times.I'm rating it 1 star for plot and direction, 5 stars for whenever Gabriel Mann is onscreen.Parallel Sons"
4,Young Oscar Flying,"These recordings date from 1945 and 1946 and were recorded in Montreal with various different musicians including Bert Brown on Bass and either Franck Gariepy or Roland Verdon on Drums.Whilst Oscar wasn't quite the finished article when these recordings were made, listen to the opening track and you can already hear a great musician. Perhaps most noteable on these early recordings is Oscar's phenomenal boogie woogie playing, which the more mature Oscar would later reserve mostly for encores. But here ""I Got Rhythm"", ""My Blue Heaven"", The Sheik of Araby and many others are given a through boogie work-out!Its not all boogie by any means and theres a nice version of ""East of the Sun"" which shows off Oscar's developing ballad playing skills.These recordings are great fun. Naturally the recording quality isn't as good as Oscar's later recordings, but its well worth getting to hear Oscar aged about 20 and having great fun. You will too if you buy this."
1,TOMMY ALDRIDGE IN SPACE!,"This movie was undoubtedly to cash-in on the popularity of Star Wars. But, let 's face it......Roger Corman 's movies are mostly (if not all) about cheap entertainment and low-budget interest. I can 't really remember much about it because I was constantly looking at the lead as Tommy Aldridge (former drummer of OZZY OSBOURNE from the 1st, 2nd and live album days).The costumes are ridiculous, acting sux, action is stupid and overall a waste of time. But, if you are a fan of these types of movies (like myself)?............YOU 'LL LOVE IT!MIG OUT."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"Although I like this movie a lot, this DVD version (not Blu-ray) is no better than the VHS. I watched the film for approximately 15 minutes before I began to get irritated by the extremely unsteady picture. Virtually every time a scene changes there is a nasty vertical jump, and during the scenes the picture constantly jerks from side to side. I prefer to watch my VHS version with the steady picture or the copy I made of the movie on ""Cinema Insomnia"" which is very amusing."
1,I know why I never saw this movie when it first came out...,"It's bad, really, really, really bad. No amount of John Barry's musical score, or Caroline Munro in a bathing suit can save this poor man's wannabe Star Wars. Cheesy, cheap special effects that are a throwback past the silent era, are peppered gingerly throughout this movie and are over used again and again and again. Generic looking sets, pleather costumes with skull caps, some of the most underwhelming stop motion animation ever and stiff as cardboard overacting with some of the most forgettable characters can't help this stinker. Even the extras are poor...a cult classic indeed for a cult that has no taste.....I gave it one star for the beauty that is Munro.You would have more fun watching a mockbuster instead...."
5,Great service,"Hard-to-find item, as Fisher-Price has discontinued the Ocean Wonders line. Arrived in perfect condition and in record time -- our daughter was thrilled at her baby shower that we found it!"
2,Poor Quality,"My 2-month-old baby loved it, while it lasted, which was around 5 weeks. Then it stopped turning. Now is a bulky low-light lamp with so-so music. Don't buy it."
3,Disappointed,"My daughter is six weeks old and enjoys watching the light show and the fish spin around. I also had trouble with the globe stopping and I had to give it a little nudge or lift up on it to make it start again. At first I thought it was just the batteries, but then after putting in new ones the problem got worse. It would stop and then make a loud clicking noise when restarting. I called Fisher Price and they ARE going to replace it after I send them back the base. I have to pay the shipping, but when the batteries are out of it it doesn't weigh very much. I figured paying for the shipping was better than buying a whole new mobile. So if you have the same problem give them a call and get it replaced!!!"
1,This is junk,I got this mobile at my shower. It worked for about 2 months and then the top started lifting up and making a clicking noise that woke my babies up. I had to replace the 4 D batteries at least once a week. The fish move so slow that it was ridiculous. Don't waste your money on this mobile!
1,Doesn't Fit,Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Mobile with Remote ControlThe handle does not adjust on the crib attachment. Our crib rail is not that wide but ssurprisingly it doesn't fit on our crib. We were so dissapointed. I can't belive fisher-price didn't have an adjustable crib mount.
1,Oh so disappointed!!,"I bought this for my son to use in his crib. First, the bottom ""fish"" I was under the impression it lit up, or if the child hit it, it might turn on the mobile. NOPE! Second, after having this only a week or so, I have gone thru 12 D batteries! And, to top it off, the music and lights only stay on for about 5 min or so. Not enough to keep a 5 month old occupied long enough to fall asleep. I took it back and will NOT be purchasing another one!! So sad because I LOVE Fisher Price toys! Oh, and the remote, you have to position the remote JUST perfectly to get it to work. Not worth the money I paid!!"
3,Hard to put together,"This was very hard to put together, esp screwing the top onto the red line. I have not used it yet, hopefully it works good seeing how much time it has took me to get this thing together."
3,Timer too short!,"This is adorable and my baby loved it, but it would shut off in less than 5 minutes. Then she'd howl! Not many babies that will doze off in just 5 minutes.The remote is handy, but who wants to stand outside the door and hit the remote every few minutes?"
2,So disappointed!!!!,"I was so excited to find this mobile. We have the crib aquarium and this would have been the perfect partner for it. But as I was taking it out of the box, I noticed some wet spots on the cardboard. Once I pulled out the main part of the unit, I found it was leaking gel! There are no punctures so it's in the seal somewhere. Needless to say, it's going back. This is the part of the mobile that the child has in the crib and can poke and play with the ""floating"" fish. The gel stinks too...no way would I put this in the crib with our daughter and I won't even get a new one. I'm afraid that a new one would develop this problem down the road. I'm very disappointed. It really would have been perfect in our daughter's crib. But I'm completely turned off from the product now."
2,Disappointment,"It's great when it's working. It only plays music for a short while so if you're baby doesn't fall asleep quick you've got to turn it back on multiple times. The remote only works if you're within 15ft of the mobile. It eats up batteries, and to change the batteries you need to remove 7 screws. I would recomend buying a different mobile."
4,Love the Mobile,I really love the mobile it helps get my baby to sleep. The only thing that I dont like about it is that you have to hit the button on the remot every 10 mins to keep it going I wish there was a timer or a way to just keep it on longer. If shes not asleep when it truns off she starts crying and then it takes that much longer to get her to go to sleep unless we turn it back on right away.
1,ocean wonders mobile stops spinning,"the fish stop spinning, I have owned two now and both have done the same thing. Fisher price has done nothing to help."
1,What were they thinking?,"I spent the better part of two afternoons putting this together for my grandson. Lo and behold, when I was finally done, it would not attach to the top crib rail, which is about two and a half inches wide. We have had two other mobiles which fit perfectly. I was also amazed that the battery box is behind a screwed on plate which means you have to disassemble the whole thing to change the batteries! Annoyed at the total waste of my time, I called FP customer service. They were not helpful at all. They suggested that my crib is a new type and that's why this doesn't fit. I told her that we have two other mobiles that are adjustable and fit perfectly. Needless to say, I got no satisfaction. We haven't decided if it's worth keeping for later when it can be used sitting on a dresser(w/o mobile) w/light show on the ceiling."
1,broke immediately,"I got this for my daughter. She tells me that this mobile was either broken when it arrived or broke within a day or two or being put on the crib. She says it started making terrible noises - the motor appeared to have broken. My daughter contacted Fisher-Price directly and they promised her a ""refund"" - only $25, much less than the actual cost. She has received nothing thus far. Very disappointing. She has now purchased a Tiny Love mobile that she finds much higher quality."
1,Doesn't fit our crib,"Now, I'm no professional, but it would seem to me that when you make a crib-mounted mobile, your first priorities would be to a) make it have stuff that spins around, and b) make it actually mountable on a crib. I guess they blew all their development money on the first requirement..."
4,"Fantastic, but...","This is another wonderful and sweet mommy saver from Fisher Price but I do wish I could change just a couple things. First, you cannot make the mobile stay on longer...if you could set it to stay on for however long you decided it would be far more convenient. Typing about convenience brings me to the second problem I have, once it has not been on for a while you can't just click the remote to activate. You have to get up, hit the button on the mobile then the remote works again. Not fun. But on the plus side, my daughter loves it...daddy loves it...I love it...my six year old loves it. The fishies and bubbles are just too cool floating around the room. Even knowing the flaws I would definately buy it again."
3,mobile,"This mobile is pretty cool. I thought it would go longer but my daughter seems to like it enough. It does move a little slower than her old mobile, so she seems to lose interest in it a lot sooner."
5,A Wild Favorite!,"We have listened to this album every Christmas season since first released and find it to be a delightful expression of the season. Cheerful, uplifting and the joyful kind of music that makes us glad to be alive and surrounded by livestock, pets and abundant wildlife (no matter the number of people on this planet, we are still outnumbered by the animals). This album grows on you; each year we play it more than the year before, each year friends and family request it more than the year before. It is noisy, busy, catchy and uniquely musical in the Christmas tradition. Our thanks to Phil and Bernie for gathering these wild and enduring sounds into the tunes on this album. This is a wild collection, highly creative, and a family favorite!"
3,Eh...,"BEAT has some decent stuff on it. I used to own it but its been a while since I heard it. Why? Because I sold it. And that is the crux of the issue. It was decent, but never really held my interest. Try LUSH LIFE instead."
4,A nifty game!,"I'm always on the lookout for a good game, and the Dark Horizons offerings certainly fit the bill. If you're into minis, Escape comes with those; if you're into a VERY clever means of map-making, look no further; rules that model close-combat quickly and clearly? Dark Horizons: Escape nails 'em all. A great find and fun to play!"
4,In the Face of Disaster,"By emphasising varied characters, the authors of this imaginative novel render abstract issues concrete. For instance, readers learn that the notion of global warming has a different impact when waves are lapping at your door, just as we learn that a government comfortably ensconced inland will only reluctantly admit that. The image of a distant, disconnected government is haunting...because all too real.In the end, the spirit of individual humans prevails, and the humanity of the characters most distingiushes ""The Rising."" Pollock and Seybold have created a fascinating cast just as they have skillfully woven a complex plot.This is a novel worth reading."
5,One of the future classics!,"If you are a fan of Spinal Tap, you will LOVE this movie. It's not like anything else - very unique in its humor. It's very,very dark and very smart. You'll pee yourself laughing. TONS of amazing extras and one of the best director's commentaries I've ever heard. Well worth the cost."
1,WTF,Terrible. Is this a movie or a guy that produce a video after randomly shooting stuff?! save yourself $6 and don't get this
2,A good idea that just isn't,"GOOD IDEA: A keychain that will beep when you whistle to help you locate it...Isn't such a good idea because: Many other sounds will also set it off continually, including TV, radios, screaming 14-month-olds, clanking pots, etc., etc., etc.You will ALWAYS know where your keys are with this keychain."
1,Key Finder,"The Whistle Key Finder goes off every time there is any high pitched or loud noise such as a woman's voice, cough, or barking dog. Very inconvenient in quiet situations such as the college classroom."
1,DONT DO It,"The only reason why I got this was because my boyfriend wanted it. What a mistake. This is the worst key finder. It goes off at any given moment, if you laugh, it goes off, if the t.v. is on, it goes off. The only enjoyment I got from this was throwing it against the wall."
1,Whistle key finder works only when you don't want it to,"This key finder beeps when there are high-pitched tones on TV, when the phone rings, and when my toy poodle barks, but not when I whistle. I can even do the really loud whistle with two fingers but it doesn't respond. It's also a very unattractive, clattery, bulky hunk of plastic on the key ring. I thought maybe it was a defective one but I had purchased two of them and gave one to a friend as a joke because she is always losing her keys. She thought it was great and got a good laugh out of it, but then it annoyed her so much, she threw it away within a week. I would say it makes a good prank gift but that's about it. Maybe if Totes made a more slender metal one that actually worked... maybe to a clap? or has that been done?"
3,Sir beeps-a-lot,"I got this as a sort of ""gag gift"" for Christmas for one of my roommates who was alway losing his keys. As soon as he opened it, hilarity and annoyingness ensued from my other roommates, who did everything in their power to get it to go off. It seems that if he takes this to class with him that there could be problems if someone speaks loud with the right frequency, so I wouldn't recommend that. I don't even think he really uses it, but I was mainly looking for a gag gift and as such, it delivers."
1,A Loser Product,"Someone gave this to me for Christmas and my experience with it forces me to label it a loser. Half the time, it doesn't respond to the whistle;other times you have to be right on top of it for it to respond and you can just bend over and pick up your set of keys;other times, it goes off in your pocket when your other keys make a jangling noise. I will admit that the light works fine. Bottom line - it's a loser."
1,very bad product :whistle keys,I need the adress so I can return the boxes. Please tell tem to include an adress when a customer wants to return an item. Thank YouA
4,LOVE IT,I REALLY LOVE THE WAY IT LOOKS. IT IS SO EASY TO FIND MY CELL. ATTACHED TO MY PURSE. THE QUALITY IS VERY GOOD. I BOUGHT ONE FOR ME AND MY DAUGHTER.... GREAT PURCHASE....
2,AWFUL MAGNETS! DO NOT BUY!,"Sure, a huge bucket full of letters and numbers is educational, but this particular bucket is a bad buy. The magnets are not very strong at all. And to make it worse, no one really thought of balance when designing this set of letters and numbers. Even with magnets, gravity still works. When you try to place a letter correctly, the low grade magnets and the weight of the plastic turn the letter on it's side. if you're very lucky, the magnet will stay there and just hang wrong. However, most of the letters just slide down to the floor. Maybe I just got a bad set; i don't know. what I do know is that less than half of the letters in the bucket would attract to the surface. and less than half of those would actually stay in place and upright. Most of them just end up on the floor. Buyer beware. keep your receipt."
3,Its ok the magnets are not good quality and the letter sizes are kinf of small,"Some of the letters were missing magnets and the magnets were NOT that strong (Slightest touch makes the letters slide down). The letter sizes were kind of small, we were not looking for jumbo sizes but these were on the smaller side.Bottom Line: For the price they charged, the letters & numbers could have been a bit larger and stronger magnets."
4,A promising start.,"Summary: an asassin for hire Mirielle Bouquet recieves an email from a sullen japanese girl with amnesia. The girls pasts are tied together and so they form an alliance to unravell the mysteries of their pasts. The animation is gorgeous, the japanese voice acting is great, the amercan dubbing isn't so great. Overall a slow but interesting begining. EP"
5,"Those ""repeated"" scenes...","I brought Noir volume one today, and to answer the first reviewer's comments on the same scene popping up over and over again: this is how the series is drawing the viewer in--first you only see a small glimpse of what happened to Marebelle's family (don't ask, just watch it already), and you learn a new clue each time.Now, back to my review--I've heard alot of good buzz about Noir, and if volume one is any indicator, this si yet another instant classic. no giggly nonsense here, the girls are all business and take no prisoners. and the music just sets each scene erfectly. IN fact, this series has the feel an a live life action series, with so many dark secrets to learn. There's ALOT of killing here, from the shoot ups to bombings, so this is NOT for the kids."
5,An abnormal anime (in a good way!),"Noir, a wonderful anime brought to the US by ADV Films. This anime is different. It is set in France and has a European feel to it. It is about two assasains trying to find-or avenge- their pasts. I recomment this for anime fans and non-anime fans alike. It is rated 15+ from it's violence(with no blood) and it's ""mature themes""(their assasains, that is a muture theme I guess...)-Lord Kronos Phoenix"
2,Buy the Soundtrack Instead,"Absolutely BEAUTIFUL music from Yuki Kajiura, who also did music for Hack Sign.Noir is all style and some substance. The concept is cool, but it goes downhill quickly after the first episode. It is unbelievable that they can gun down hordes of men and not get scathed. The action itself is stylish and unique, but again unbelievable. And why are the main characters only women? There are enough over-sexualized women power fantasies for boys to watch.If you want to see a cool and stylish action anime, buy Read or Die instead of 26 episodes of Noir at $20 a DVD."
4,Not a great ending,"No Story Line Reveled.I have watched the entire series and like most TV series some episodes are better then others.I think the character and plot development throughout the series is great. We learn a little bit more about the characters as time progresses and the plot keeps you guessing up until the end. Which brings me to my one complaint about the series, the ending. I will not tell you how it ends but I was disappointed."
4,A story with real Alaskan flavor,"I really enjoyed reading this novel, the details of Alaskan life were very authentic. The characters were believable and felt true to life. The plot line was well-developed and suspenseful. I would recommend this book to anyone who has or wants to visit Alaska, as a matter of fact I sent it to my grandmother for Christmas! I look forward to more novels from Doug Letch and can't wait to find out what other sorts of situations the main character, Hayden White, can get himself into."
5,A stunningly clever book,"As an Alaskan it is always interesting to read a book by a local author. This is even more the case when the book is as enjoyable and well written as ""Bitter Cold"" by Doug Letch. Mr. Letch uses humor and his insight into the Alaskan political system to craft a compelling and witty story that makes for a quick and enjoyable read. I am sure readers will appreciate the book not only for the fact that it's setting and characters are realistic and entertaining but also for the fact that it's a damn good book."
1,Read John Lilly's contribution (chapters 1-3) skip the rest.,"John Lilly invented the floatation tank. In chapters 1-3 he explains the how, why and possibilities. Useful. Unfortunately, E.J. Gold contributed chapters 4-8. Gold tells everyone at a floatation tank workshop ""do not wee-wee in the tank"". Right.Gold also contributed ink drawings throughout the book that are just plain weird, hard to take and disturbed. Skip this book and find floatation tank information elsewhere"
5,imaginative,enlightening words about remarkable experiences that most can only imagine. Treated with respect and near reverence by an editor that takes the time to know her subject and her material.Very impressive!
5,Love this watch!,"This is a very handsome watch, with a great shade of blue on the face. I bought it as an engagement gift, and my fiancee was very excited about it and shows it off to everyone."
4,can't find these locally,"My under counter kitchen light fixtures take this bulb. I can actually find them locally, but either at a horrendous price or a horrendous quality. These are reasonably priced and based on the one bulb I replaced, give the light quality I expected (the local cheapo had a dim bluish cast after a few weeks'use, then blew out entirely)and seems to be long-lasting. Not much more to say about a light bulb"
4,Dan loves that slide,Lanois Has consistently put out good work. His solo outings are all must haves.(especially Acadie and For the Beauty of Winona)You got to wonder what U2 would have done with out him.This release is all instrumental and the slide guitar work is ethereal.
5,Lost In Pedal Steel,"Daniel Lanois has come up with a collection of intrumental stylings, ranging from ambient (along the lines of his friend, Brian Eno) to reggae, that cooly move you through a variety of landscapes. Several are reminiscent of his album, ""Acadie"". Others seem to suggest lyrics, though there are no vocals. The connection across songs on this album is the pedal steel. It's been said that guitar players should avoid even touching pedal steel as they'll never come back. With sounds like Daniel got on this album, that wouldn't be such a bad thing. The only negative is that his singing voice is not present, because he has obviously gotten lost in pedal steel."
3,A not-as-cohesive effort by the legendary Canadian producer,"After albums such as his ""Shine"" and the soundtrack to Billy Bob Thornton's ""Slind Blade"", Daniel Lanois' ""Belladonna"" sounds like a less-than-optimal effort. As an ambient work, it misses the mark, lagging behind the efforts of his colleagues Brian Eno and Harold Budd. As an instrumental guitar work, it results limited. Overall, it can be enjoyable, but it lacks the cohesiveness of previous works and even has some tracks I can only fast-forward through. As excited as I was when I found out that he'd released a new album, I can't get myself to play it endlessly as I was able to with most of his previous works, including those where he'd be sitting in the producer's chair and/or playing guitar for the likes of Gabriel, Dylan or U2."
3,"Subtle yes, but","Daniel Lanois has created an ambient, instrumental work. I just wish it had been more tuneful."
3,Think Music for Westerns,If Brian Eno followed his ambient classic Music for Airports with Music for Westerns it would probably sound like this.On this album there is no singing by Daniel Lanois just a nice collection of beautiful western tinged ambient music.Very blissful and atmospheric.My only complaint is that it is also very short at under 40 minutes and I wish that it went on longer.If you're a fan of Brian Eno's non vocal work or of Harold Budd you will enjoy this dreamy album.
5,Another gem from Daniel Lanois,"In this album Mr. Daniel Lanois further explores the styles he established in his previous record ""Shine"". Mr. Lanois plays pedal steel guitar throughout the album to create different moods. The musical pieces are different in style yet united in their dreamy and eloquent expressiveness. While listening, you feel like you are floating and smiling at the same time. The cd is a musical feast. I have to admit that I was saddened not to have at least one track in which Mr. Lanois sings, because I enjoy his voice and his lyrics, but the pleasure of listening to these eloquent instrumental pieces is more than enough. A must have if you are a fan of Mr. Lanois' work, and definitely worth listening if you know nothing about the guy. Personal recommendation: listen to two other cd's of Mr. Lanois - ""Acadie"" and ""For the Beauty of Wynona"", both masterpieces."
2,Boring!!!!,"You've got to really like to listen to cops talk to enjoy this book. It's as if the author taped these conversations and transcribed them verbatim along with all the little verbar quirks we're all prone to make. One thing I will say though, it opens you eyes as to the way crimes are really solved. If you like mysteries, you'll be very disappointed in the reality"
5,Mr. Fantastic!,"This little cutie needs to be enjoyed by everyone! If this isn't the most darling doggie in the world, I don't know what is. Do yourself a favor and count down 2001 with this cantankerous tiny tramp. (I especially reccommened the groovy sixties throwback picture.) Mother and grandma endorse the sleeping bumble bee."
3,Not Quite Essential,"As a lifelong Stevie Wonder Fan if you want his early greatest hits 1963-1971 and a few sirprises,then Do Yourself A Favor and buy this! However,If you want a better collection with no filler(songs put on to take up space)then search for a collection called ""Looking Back"" and educate your mind. By the way a great collection his later material(72-75?)is Musicquarium Volume 1. there hasn't been a vol.2 yet."
5,Incredible,This is a Great Set.His Vocals are Great.The Words&Music are Fantastic.His Work is Timeless.What A Great Genius.
4,GOOD OLD READING,MY DAUGHTER IS STARTING TO COLLECT THESE BOOKS. I WISH I HAD KEPT MINE FROM YEARS AGO. BOOK 21 DOES NOT MATCH THE FIRST 20 NOT SURE IF IT CHANGED THEN OR WHAT. BUT STILL GOOD
5,Review by a Golden Oldie,"I bought this as a surprise for Kenny Welch, who actualy worked for BOCwhen this was recorded and is listed in the credits.We both really enjoyed seeing the bonus DVD.It brought back lots of memories for two OLDIES! Great music! I had forgotten how much fun our younger days were!"
5,No Columbus Ga. here....,"Regards,I have been a devout fan of BOC since the early 70s...and so it is always great to have any footage of the band....However, the two tracts from the album, ETI and Astronomy, performed in Columbus, Ga, are NOT the same as performed on the DVD, and I was really, really dismayed at this. The info. on the CD/DVD is correct...there is NO footage from Cols. Ga...which is the sole reason I bought the DVD (I live in Columbus, Ga...)...oh well...was a nice thought anyway..."
1,Really Bad Audio,Audio is what this all about. I did buy it for the DVD but the cd audio is bad too. These guys were great musicians but this should not have been released.
2,Some enchanted evening...,"Even the new Legacy Edition of Some Enchanted Evening [includes a DVD] can't make Some Enchanted Evening compelling.After not hearing it for 20+ years, my take hasn't changed: the only thing that _still_ moves is ""Astronomy."" Part H.P. Lovecraft, part Robert E. Howard, part Heavy Metal (the magazine) and part Heavy Metal (the music), it's eight and a half minutes of Humboldt Select, drawn out bliss. The ""2.0 version"" of Astronomy on the Imaginos LP is pretty interesting (actually, that LP is way underrated), and the Metallica cover on ""Garage, Inc."" is worth a spin.The DVD's very sub-par picture quality is not really a problem. However, the audio quality is. It sounds like they used a couple a mics flown in front of the stage. For completists only."
3,"""MORE COWBELL!"" (No, really.)","""More cowbell!"" It's true.While this is a solid live album overall, and the band has ""what appears to be a dynamite sound,"" the version of ""(Don't Fear) the Reaper"" included here features not a whisper of cowbell!Where have you gone, Gene Frenkle?"
5,"b.o.c.,s some enchanted evening amazing remaster!!!!","i still love this album 31 years later.this new remaster is even better than the original release!!this album was recorded on b.o.c,s spectres tour of 1977-1978,b.o.c. was using lazer lights on this tour!!if you are a blue oyster cult fan grab this album,it is a great document of how b.o.c. sounded live circa 77-78.i hope legacy remasters mirrors,extraterrestrial live and more of the rest of b.o.c,s catalog soon!!"
1,Just not reliable enough for ongoing remote use,"I've had the system installed for a little over a year now and have given up - it's just too flaky.Probably OK if you are at home and can unplug it every once in a while to force a reboot and re-association with the Z-wave devices, but just not robust enough if you are away for more than a week or two. What happens after a while is either a) the gateway doesn't respond or b) it no longer sees the devices. It would probably help if one could reboot it remotely via the browser, but that isn't possible.When it works it works fine, but the web browser interface is too limiting and at any one time there is probably a 40-50% probability that remote control over the web will work."
1,No work-No support,I purchased the gateway and three lamp modules-setup is easy and quick. From there on this is a piece of junk. Tech support from these people is non existant. The only way to get it back running is to reset the gateway and detect the modules-a little hard to do from a remote location. They need to change the name from home remote pro to remote control from your computor when you are home. Dont buy it.
5,"Great for us big kids, too!","I have allergies and a lot of flowery-scented shampoos make me sneeze or break out in hives. So I decided that if you can get this stuff in your EYES and it won't hurt you, then it's probably gentle enough for me. I was right.Extra bonus is the fantastic cherry scent. Can't tell you how many compliments I get on how my hair smells. I don't tell them it's a kids' shampoo that I use!!! LOL!"
5,BEAUTIFUL,"And fits awesome, feels great and appears to be very well made. My first arcetyx product but def not the last. I will be picking them up whenever the need arises. Awesome."
2,Wheels of churning,"My first delivery was not working on the first try. I was provided a replacement that my daughter loves to play on. However, after a couple weeks now most of the racing games are no longer working any more. Most of the vertical racing games must use the same scrolling module as the screen doesn't move up or down. Therefore these games are rendered useless.Though she still likes the others on the system. The ease of use is very attractive as we don't own game systems in the house."
3,arcade game,"We purchase this game for Christmas in 2006 was easy to set up and get started. For the price it has poor graffics,some of the games wont work, No instructions on how to play each game, you have to figure it out as you go along. With in 30 days my daughter was tired of playing it, just collects dust now."
4,good thick rug,"good thick rug - very dense, very soft. This is a WHITE rug - very white. Even so, it resists stains very well. Sheds like the dickens, but was told that all very good quality wool rugs shed for a few months. Have had mine for 3 months and it still sheds so much it drives me crazy.Other than the constant shedding, love this rug, very beautiful, good quality."
5,Amuro Namie..great artist,"Everyone must here at lest one of her CDs 181920 is the one I would recomend to most first time listeners. Even if you do not understand the Japanese, well you can still follow with her inserted English words. Amuro Namie is an Amazing artist with great ablitys, not to mention the instrumentals to all of her music is fantastic. Her CDs are truely a Must for everyone."
3,Another pathetic example of mis-marketing,"Please, Namie Amuro is a great dancer, and very good looking, but don't make her out to be more than she is. She was a flash in the pan. Like her old stuff, and let it pass. The beauty of many (not all) Japanese singers/groups is the grooming that goes into a perfomance. Namie had more than the norm, but not enough to make it in a foreign market. Am I shallow? Am I ignorant of the culture? Am I just racist? More likely I have just seen more Japanes acts than you have. Trust me, heard more than say....five recent bands and you have probably heard the mainstream of Japan."
1,this girl can't sing,her voice is not that good.her music is not that good.this is not even asian best.
4,was an instant hit worldwide...,"Another absolutely incredible import track picked up by Twisted for domestic US release, this melody (or loop or whatever you call it) gets in your head and under your skin and makes you dance! I love it."
3,Great for Fans not for beginners,"If you're a Paul Gilbert Fan you will love this video. He's got a great personality and he shows you all of the cool riffs from his new album of the same name. My only complaint is that he dosen't include any tab either in printed form or ""pop up"" screens during the video. The video moves fast so be prepared to use the pause and slow functions to try and keep up.If he were to publish some tablature on his website that went along with the video it would help make this video a 5 star product"
2,Shaking of Children???,"This book was cute with the pictures but the content is about the angry parent a lot. Mr. Squirrel stops often to shake the children because they were so naughty. I found this to be pretty horrible to read to a child. This book is promoting in a way child abuse, what is this? I packed this back up and off it goes. I dont need to read to my child about these things.Too bad as the book is cute in size and pictures but needs to be fully re written.The 2 stars are for the book size and pictures only."
2,dancing carl,"This book was alright, I found it to be very confusing. Everytime there was a new chapter it seemed like the book had just forgot about all theother chapters and started on another subject. If you are one who likes books like that and are able to keep up with changing subjects then this is a great bok for you. Anyway this book is about two best friends, who meet this guy that takescare of the ice skating rinks in their town. He is Carl. Every now and then Carl will come on to the rinks and dance, his dance makes everyone stop and look . The two boys look far into Carl, I mean they search for the reason he does this. They find there answer after one of the boys brings a model of and B-17 war plane to the rinks. Please read the book. It was ok but confusing at times."
1,This is a terrible book,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. I had to read it for school, and don't get me wrong, I like reading, but this book was terrible. The plot is sketchy, the charecters are weak and the setting is over used. Any teacher who sees this, please do not make your class read this because I garentee it is a waste of time."
2,Unique genius sometimes seems odd,"I'm not from Cuba, so maybe I missed something. This CD by Mr G seems very inconsistent. Some of the tunes groove along, but others just sound awkward and don't go anywhere. Three of the eleven numbers are entirely instrumental. I appreciate lots of ""out there"" kinds of music, from Sun Ra and Archie Shepp and selected works of Herbie Hancock, but some of Mr G's rants/scat/vout/jazz vocals just fall short of greatness for me. Fortuneately, he has left most of the ""vouting"" behind.I did enjoy listening to him reminisce about people and times of old, but I don't think I would have purchased this item just for that."
5,"""Siboney"" Is A Slim Gaillard Masterpiece!",".""Siboney"" is a truly wonderful album by Slim Gaillard. This is musical genius that is unique and just can't be compared. I had a great time getting to know this album. It grows on you quickly!** Havana! - Lecumi - Midnight Congas - La Comparsa - Nanjingo - Cocinero. **There are some genuine classics here.This album belongs in every music lover's catalog. It has a Cuban flair but also has a sweeping dramatic movie soundtrack feel to it at times. Fantastic instrumentals and great vocals by Mr. Gaillard.""I want to go to Havana!"" And you will too! - Alan Dyer"
4,Not bad,"This was my first Danielle Girard book and it will not be my last. The story moves along at a good pace, the main character is very likable, and I did not guess who the ""bad guy"" was."
5,amazing,I don't read much but when I picked up this book I couldn't put it down. Danielle Girard keeps you turning the pages.
2,Too short!,"This game took me about 2 hours to finish! It was wayyyyy too short! Also, it should have been more challenging! Waste of money."
1,Spend your money elsewhere,"I played this game for a total of 45 minutes, then returned it to the store for a refund. The flow of the game is very klunky -- the narrator keeps repeating the same instructions over and over again. There is no ability to move around in the environments. Then, to top it all off, it crashed my PC.Very poor quality. I can't believe a software manufacturer would have allowed this junk to go out the door.Buy something else -- ANYTHING else. I guarantee you'll have more fun."
3,Frustrating bugs - wait to buy!!,"Oh my gosh - I too am someone who was eagerly anticipating the arrival of this new game and eagerly did a full installation yesterday (the day it arrived on my doorstep). But I am only a bit into the first case (for the second time because the first time I thought I must be doing somethign wrong) and the bugs are frequent and bothersome. I have two click twice on questions almost all the time before they get asked. And after awhile things start disappearing (the pictures of items I've collected, text on my tool box, etc).What I've seen and done so far is exciting which is why I'm being optimistic and giving three stars - I suspect that with the bugs fixed it will be a five star product but not now!Definitely watch the UBI website and wait for corrections or upgrades or, if you buy it, steel yourself for likely disappointment."
1,Aren't games supposed to be fun?,"I didn't have nearly as much trouble with bugs as some people, but Dark Motives is still a waste of money. There's no point to it, really, since there's nothing to figure out or decide for yourself. You just go where the game tells you to go and click on what you're supposed to click on and ask the questions you're supposed to ask. What's the point of that?Short, boring, pointless. No more CSI for me, thanks. After playing both this and Sherlock Holmes: Silver Earring, I'm not sure I'll waste any more money on Ubisoft games."
3,Brain Power or NO,"To really test your investigative skills, you need to play this game on the most difficult level. Anything less than that makes this game a click through to some degree, meaning that all you have to do is click on the highlighted items and it will take you to the next step.Other than that, the game is interesting. The cases are interesting. But sometimes they can be a bit frustrating trying to find out what piece of evidence will crack the case for you.Another frustrating thing is the fact that you cannot do anything while the characters are speaking. But I've discovered that right-clicking or hitting the spacebar cancels the current speech. However, when you are required to answer questions at the end, some of the questions are based on what was said.Try it and see for yourself. Have fun."
2,Not happy,"I was very excited with this game at first. I am a huge Sims lover and I wanted something different for a while. I liked the game at first but soon realized the game was a big disappointment.1.I had to keep restarting the game because of bugs (I know its the game and not my computer).2. It was so repetitive, the same thing over and over3. Maybe a 5 or 6 dollar game but not worth anything more than that. A somewhat smart person could finish this game in about 2 hours maybe less. So no I would not suggest buying it unless you find it here very cheap."
3,not my cup of tea,Something may have been lost in translation of this unfunny comedy. (Perhaps the Hebrew version is a hoot). I'm giving it 3 stars because it is of some cultural interest about the Georgian community.
1,not that great.,"Its ok, but not that great. You people should not require me to use a certain number of words, it just doesnt make sense. I only wanted to say it is good."
2,Disappointing,"I had this on my ""wish list"" for quite awhile and finally had the time to watch it. I spend a fair amount of time in Israel and enjoy Israeli and other foreign films. I was very disappointed in this and had a hard time finishing it. The acting and story line were good, but the film moved very slowly. Perhaps if my understanding of Hebrew was better it would have had more depth, but as it was it was dull and could have been so much more interesting."
1,Depressing & should have been X rated.,"This is a story of people adrift from any real uplifting, mutually blessing, moral values. I certainly hope that is not a standard picture of Israeli parents & relatives. The way they staked out the girl friend's apartment, rifled it with many humiliating remarks, & threatened her - with total indifference to her little girl's presence - was a great depiction of cruel, cold self righteous indignation.I found it concerning that the boyfriend liked to lie on the floor and extend his arms up in the air for the little girl to try to balance herself on his hands - all with her wearing a short skirt. Even more concerning was the bizarre scence in the bathroom with his father where the man is on his knees pressing his face into his father's crotch & making pretty strange remarks. Perhaps the movie was giving us a hint of at least one source for the tie that binds, or chokes.Altogether a very sad story for everyone involved."
4,Much Better Than Expected,"A real surprise of a film, very watchable and interesting. The lead actors are attractive and competent. Even the dog ""Mouki"" can steal a scene!"
1,Hypocrites and a Mama' Boy,"Apparently, the other reviewers saw a different film, because the one I watched was awful. The only remotely likeable character in the whole movie was the little girl. I've never been to Israel, so I can't comment on what life is like there, but I really don't believe that the losers in this film portray the typical Israeli. Basically, the film is about hypocritical old men, stupid women, and the biggest Mama's Boy of all time."
2,Bummer of a Movie,"The first sentence on the back of the DVD case says, ""In the tradition of such recent comedic hits as My Big Fat Greek Wedding and Monsoon Wedding, comes this"", etc.WRONG! That opener is the reason I chose ""Late Marriage"", but boy is that ever misleading; who writes those little synopses, anyway? Is there no accountability?Instead, this movie ""treats"" us to an unbelievably demanding and overbearing family, and the 31 year old son who tolerates their abuse. This family's behavior just stretched the limits of credulity WAY beyond acceptable boundaries. Yeah, I know it's just a movie, and one has to take these things with a grain of salt, but this one requires about ten oceans worth.Oh, and that's not to mention the abrupt and inexplicable ending. A total letdown.Let's see, I would recommend this movie to, hmmm; no one, sorry."
3,Hurt by removal of editting,"The description says ""since more than 150,000 words had been cut from the original manuscript."". It would have been good if they had kept it out. A slow paced story was made glacial."
2,After All These Years,After hearing this title on the radio a short while ago it literally captured my sentimental heart. I immediately went on line and purchased it. If you have a spouse you love and want to share the joy of the lyrics with him/her don't pass this one by.!!
5,!,"This is an incredibly well-researched, well-written, and interesting book on an obscure topic. The photographs included are amusing and helpful."
2,Good wall socket for jazz,"This is a good wall socket for jazz. Unfortunately my listening is mostly Tuvan throat-singing, hence the two stars. If you are looking for a decent entry-level wall socket, and you do not particularly care about a clear throat gurgle, go right ahead. I am still looking.Note: Although this is marketed as a duplex wall socket, it is equally suited to single-family dwellings."
4,Almost five stars,"Pros: Listening to music is now a whole new experience. Everything I play sounds like the music of the spheres. The socket also clearly has some advanced AI built into it, because if try to play bad music--music that no amount of cryogenic gold plating can help, like Britney Spears or John Mayer--it'll immediately trip the circuit breaker and prevent you from being subjected to it.Cons: The T-shape on the wider plug (for you electrician nerds, for 5-20p rather than 5-15p plugs) means that unless you have any Wattgate Electron Pacifier Plugs installed to cap that up, precious electrons will leak out the side, diminishing your audio experience. They're only $29.95 per plug, and are made of the finished cryogenically treated plastic available.Because they don't include these plugs, I had to remove one star. Otherwise, great device! It also works with my CD rewinder, too; it's not just for audio equipment. CDs rewind 20% faster."
4,An unexpected benefit,"I was very satisfied with this outlet behind my entertainment center with myPanamax M5300-PM 11-Outlet Home Theater Power Conditionerplugged in to it. Sound has never been better. Emboldened by the success, I thought to put one of these outlets in the garage where I plug in myBlack & Decker CMM1200 19-Inch 24-Volt Cordless Electric Mulching Lawn Mower(which I like very much, thank you). It took a couple of charges to get to full effectiveness, but yes, the cut has become more even. Yes, there used to be small ruts where the wheels went and minor ridges next to them, and the odd weed sticking up, but no more! Now I go out with mylaser leveland check the grass after each cut, and it's perfect! The bagging feature works better, too. I haven't had to get out the broom or blower in a month!I did have to deduct one star because when I tried the outlet with a hair dryer, it singed my hair. (But the outlet was cold to the touch immediately afterward!)"
5,W O W......T H E Y ' V E......C O M E.....B A C K..!,"AM I THE ONLY ONE TO SEE ""The Bobsy Twins' Ghosts"" in this product? Girl on top, boy underneath. And BOY -- do they look miserable! PLEASE don't buy this product -- or if you do, make sure you either have an excorcist on hand, and/or a trained mechanic, (preferably licensed), to help out if and when the ""B. Twins"" decide to come OUT of the socket and haunt you for real. Because they CAN't do anything whilst you've got them sitting in your home. It's only afterwards, and/or if they, like ""The Bobbsy Twins"" now find themilk instead. But -- it's TUSCAN MILK --!Well, I'm gettimng a little sleepy rght now. So will end here.(p.S.: Don't get this twin-socket wet!)"
1,"You Clowns Must Be Kidding, Right?","Anyone stupid enough to waste money on this is the most gullible person in the world. This does in NO way improve SOUND. What it does is improve the bank account of the company. What's next? Audio cables made of platinum? Why not, when there are dupes by the thousands! Oy, Veh!"
1,0.0 Lbs,"I don't generally get discouraged by negative reviews.So inspite of one customer feedback that his scale didn't workright out of the box. I bought it. Guess what? mine also didn't work initially ,when it did . It shows ""ERR"".Attempt to contact tanita has been futile inspite of being on hold for more than 45 mins. I am returning this to Amazon."
5,excellent all around,"I got my scale today and it got here in fine shape. Amazon must have read the other reviews because it was packed in a box inside of a box and it worked fine right off. I have hard wood floors and the beauty of the wood shows thru the glass making the scale almost a piece of comtemporary sculpture. Multiple steppings on produce almost identical results-- a rare difference in tenths only. One thing of note, the instructions say to tap the lower right corner with the foot to wake it up. I needed almost a stomp. So a little experimentation and I found the tapping spot is the upper right corner not lower right. I just got it today so if it keeps working this good it'll be around for a long long time. I'm not trying to lose weight-- Actually I'm trying to gain weight--I know-Oh poor me. But, the scale reads a about 1.5 pounds lighter than my old scale so you might lose a little just opening the box."
5,A Weighty Matter,"If you are looking for an attractive bathroom scale, with only basic features, this is an excellent choice. The design is simple and fits in very well in limited space. The operation is also simple and reliable. You can't beat the price for a scale of this beauty and reliability."
1,Weight shown is incorrect !!!,"The first time I weigh myself, I am 10 lb lighter than normal, it made me super happy. But when I try again later, it says I am only 99lb, which is far off. And I try several times, I got 89lb, 55lb, 103lb, all of them are obviously wrong.Also, it is so hard to reset the scale. I have to tap on it for at least 10 times before I can step on it, and the weight it shown is incorrect ! Will never purchase digital scale again."
1,not accurate,The scale is hard to turn on and doesn't give an accurate read. I tried it 3 times in a row and each time it read a drastically different weight.
2,"Works, but simply not accurate enough","I am pleased with the appearance of this scale, but with little else. The weight readings just don't make sense. For example: weight when walking in the door: 168.2, weight after a small salad: 169.4, weight after a medium size meal: 171.2. Come on. I'm not a dietician, but these don't make any sense! Similar illogical up and down fluctuations continued over the next few days. The scale seems accurate within a pound or so, but this is not nearly as accurate as I would like."
5,caught by surprise,"As a musician and jazz fan, i was really impressed with the writing and arrangements these guys put together.Mike Stern as guest on guitar was a nice surprise and Kim Stone from the Rippingtons with G.G.Greg Gonaway from Mariah Carey's band, lay down a solid rhythm section.The ""Phat"" arrangement of Monk's""Well you needn't"" really slammed and the group's ""Hendrix meets Steely Dan"" tune called the ""Raptor"" is one of the best jams out there.Guitarist,James Mac and keyboardist Bob Mocarsky,are not only excellent composers but formidible soloists to boot.Top this off with Composer/Sax-master Scott Kreitzer you get one great CD.Highly Recommended!"
5,Brian Ayers,"One of the best live albums from the best musicians in popular music today. The songs with the orchestra are really exceptional, as the orchestra really brings out the best in the music. The live version of ""Six Degrees"" is overwhelming, and ends in majestic fashion, really one of the most memorable 42 minutes you will hear in music. I was not thrilled with the songs selection, but after listening to it all the way through, it's perfect. Don't buy this without buying the DVD also, which I feel is the best produced of their DVDs yet. I have been to numerous DT concerts, and this DVD captures the feeling of being there to a T."
5,Best concert I've seen,"This concert represents all that is DT from the Majesty Days up thru Octavarium. Not only were they so on this night (both the band and James) but we got to see Raise the Knife which is a highlight for me. I went to the show alone as my friends don't share my musical passion and I recall during Raise the Knife tapping the dude next to me because I could not contain my joy watching Mike Portnoy play during this tune. It was awesome. God I hope Mangini can come close to matching MP's musicality.Anyway I bought the DVD the day it came out, but now feel the need for the CD as well. By they way if you have not seen the DVD do it (Netflix)What a show, orchestra was so cool. Don't let the set list prevent you from getting this."
5,It is better than anything I have heard from them,"Old stuff, new stuff - this is an excellent CD. The music will blow your minds.The only compliant is on the song ""Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence"". Unlike original recording, there are no separate tracks for each of the movements of this song. So if you are like me, and like to advance to particular movements, you'll have to get used to using the FF button on your CD player."
2,Same problem,"After all these years, DT lacks what they've always lacked; (and is what is at the heart of prog music) and that's a sense of counterpoint and harmonic development. It's all chord changes with banal melodies and fast licks. Oh sure, the chops are there. Astounding. But there's no statement. The classic bands (Yes, ELP, Gentle GIant, et al) had chops too (though not to the speed of DT) but they had something more ...SONGS. The intricacies where within the composition. This stuff sonds like one dimensional jams with fancy riffs thrown in along the way. It's barely above DraginForce -- who are a joke, but they too have blistering speed. DT never developed into what I hoped they would. They just do what they've always done, only faster."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,3 DISC SET..1 DECENT CD..2 CRAPPY CD'S..THEY COULD HAVE @ SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALOT BETTER !!!!!!!!!!!!
2,"Great Songs, Poor Quality","The EQ/Mastering for this disc is very poor. The songs, although well performed lack bite and sound dull, lifeless and flat. Listening to the opening song (Root Of All Evil) I found the drums to be less than thunderous yet the air horn/alarm noise is up front and louder than the rest of the band. When the entire band kicks in it becomes a flat EQ/compressed mess of sound. This continutes for the entire 3 disc set. Also, I am not impressed with the orchestra. Out of tune and did not mesh well with the band. Too bad beacuse I have seen the DVD of this show and it was very impressive (first set). I also did not like how they cut out LaBrie's in between song comments."
1,Useless book,"Better to read daily articles in indian news websites . They do better job in criticizing Hindus in India. This book tries to do the same but failed in convincing arguments. In anycase, IF you are pseudo secular or anti hindu , you will get some arguments for your discussion. If you have some sense , you will laugh at this book and throw it out (Or resale it )"
2,Wished I purchased Something Else,"When taking this out of the box I was pretty happy with my purchase. After opening it and seeing the quality of the case, I was not impressed. There is not alot of padding on this case. It is very thin and I feel that the CD's or DVD's could be damaged in this case. Also, the zipper when opened ends up behind the binder. I had to dig my fingers up and behind the binder to find the zipper. so, now I have to make sure that I don't open the zipper all of the way or else I won't be able to close the case. For 15 dollars I think the case should be more padded and the zipper should not be falling behind the binder."
3,Disappointed,"The product is not an original. The original was probably scanned and reprinted as this product. Although normally that is not a problem, it is when you can get an original for the same price. The pressing issues are that the cover is red, not green like the original, the pictures are too dark to be discernible, and the sometimes blurry print irritates the musician's eyes. Also, the back cover was bent when i received it.The product itself as the other reviewers have stated is amazing. It lends the musician a new perspective on interpretation and technique for the double bass. However, if one can get a better copy of the product at the same price somewhere else, it makes no sense to buy it here. I'm sorry, but that's how i feel.Good job though on getting it to the costumer on time(and even quicker than the time predicted it would take, i believe)."
5,Had to have it,"I love Joe Cocker and needed to have some the standards I was raised on. This album is excellent and I suspect he is an acquired taste, but I am enjoying this album."
4,Joe Cocker at his best,"I bought this album for ""Feeling Alright"" and was happy with the rest of the selections. After all, Joe Cocker is Joe Cocker - he's a legend."
4,Past Memories Revived,"Wow!You are going to want to experience this music again! Not only does it sound wonderful, it plays better than it did originally. It will take you back and clear away the cobwebs to memories you may have forgotten.Thank you Joe!! Keep rockin'."
3,Disappointing,"I'm a Cocker fan from way back and was looking for the hard rocker version. This CD is overly orchestrated and the duet is almost embarrassing. I feel like the kid on ""Hook"" that squeezes Robin William's face (as Peter Pan) and sorta sees Peter. Every now and then I hear the old rocker but more often than not it just sounds like a Tony Bennett cover of songs with a raspy voice. Where has Joe gone?"
3,Hit&Miss Compilation,there are better overall Hits Packages on Joe cocker.this one misses because it doesn't include all of His Hits.but this collection is a Pretty Good start for a Newbie to His Music.His Voice still has that whiskey feel to it.
3,Mention the good with the bad.,"The author makes some very valid and helpful points to be aware of when purchasing an RV, new or used, and in deciding if you should use it for the occasional trip or go full-time. He does, however, seem to focus entirely on the negative aspects of rving. He mentions that he and his wife enjoyed their rv trips at the beginning of the book, so I think it would only have been fair to have shared some of his enjoyable experiences with rvs as well as the unpleasant ones. Still, overall, it was not a bad book; I found it quite easy to read, and again, it does bring up some very important Buyer Beware warnings. Perhaps he would consider writing a less one-sided sequel?"
1,"Very little info about actual rv'ing, full or part time...","I awaited this book to help us decide on what type/make of rv to purchase, as we are not very knowledgable on the subject. I was dissapointed to receive a book with only about 50 pages, several of which were copies of other pages, and about 20 of the 50 were about an rv that is no longer on the market. I was hoping to learn some of the differences, the plus/minus between the different types of rv's, ie 5th wheels, trailers, motor homes, truck campers, etc. I think I've learned much more reading the advertising brocures of the different manufacturers and talking to salespeople about their product. I do not recommend this book. So as not to sound like sour grapes, I have purchased many how to and information type books and have never felt compelled to give a review such as this. I've wasted my money, don't waste yours."
4,Aquaintance to the world of telecommunication,"It is idle time for understanding a management will allow you to accustom to a developing area of telecommunications quickly. Written by skilled experts of company Hill Associates - the leading company on preparation of technical experts in the field of telecommunications, this book contains the technical information necessary for understanding and application of key technologies."
4,Does a very nice job for mid-level systems.,"I've been using this sub with other Klipsch speakers in a 5.1 system for the past 5 years or so.While low frequency response tends to be omnidirectional, I've found that corner placement of this unit smoothes out the reponse quite a bit and eliminates a lot of the ""boominess"" that some complain of.So much depends on the acoustics of the specific room that it's difficult to know what this or any other sub will sound like prior to installation and some experimentation.It might not compare to some more expensive and more powerful subs, but it works nicely for my situation. Considering that my situation is a New York City apartment, anything much more powerful than this would likely get me evicted."
5,Great for a smaller room or your first subwoofer.,"Sound is great for the budget minded and a small area. If you have a large room, you should consider the 12 inch or checkout the higher powered subwoofers."
2,"Worked ""ok"" for 2.5yrs... Now it's near death","I should've dug a little deeper before this purchase. Apparently more of these issues are creeping up. Amp was never really impressive. It did the job, and sounded pretty good, but would overdo some of the dramatic lows, and then be barely audible the remainder of the time. I put in at least 5-6hrs playing with adjustments when I first set it up until I finally called it good enough. Didn't think much about it until a couple months ago when the dramatic lows would simply shake the house and cause our cats to nearly hit the roof! This would occur at the most inopportune times such as during a commercial while watching regular TV. We do not watch TV or movies, nor listen to music at loud levels (not even remotely!) I have now turned the amp off as it became embarassing when company was over this past weekend. Bottom line... for it's size, it was fairly decent, not great. 2.5 years of ""OK"" use though is simply unacceptable. Will NOT buy Klipsch again."
1,Google Klispch Subwoofer not working,"Sounded awesome but amp WILL fail. Google ""Klispch subwoofer not working"" I would have given it 5 stars had I wrote a review before the amp failed. Googled the sub and was in shock because everyone describing same type of failure. They use poor quality components!"
5,LOVE the deep base!,"Klipsch has enjoyed am excellant reputation over the years and I must say that even though this is one of their least expensive subs, it lives up to my expectations. I'd recommend it without hesitation."
1,Former Klipsch sub-owner,I would still own the Klipsch sub...but the amp blew on it...it wasnt even used that much. I'm very disappointed with Klipsch. The sub truly sounded great when it worked...but once it blew and i was researching it online..realized that Klipsch doesn't provide reliable powered subwoofers. I am in the market for a new sub now...and am ready to spend well more than i did for the KSW10...but it sure wont be on Klipsch.
4,Autun and the big black bear,"Autun and the bear is a good little book if you like vikings. I think you will like this story. It can be read by 4th or 5th graders, there aren't many hard words. This review was written by my son.)"
3,BS is Back!,Print was acceptable with 20 min. additional footage missing from previus versions. I've seen far worse prints. Give it a chance!
3,ONLY 81 MN,OK I DON'T THE OTHERS DVD OF THIS MOVIE IT SEEMS THEY ARE 3 BUT THIS ONE IS NOT THE INTEGRAL VERSION ONLY 81 MN AND NOT 101 MN AS INDICATED SO I DON T KNOW WHAT IS THE GOOD DVD IF SOMONE COULD TELL ME THANK YOU VERY MUCH
5,a double helping of Steele,"Another Spaghetti horror that helped propel the stunning Barbara Steele to the top as Queen of Horror films. Basically, a trite and routine Italian horror romp, that largely benefits from Steele powerful presence. She has a duo role as a wife cheating on her scientist husband and her cousin. Does she not know it's dangerous to cheat on mad scientist hubbies? He is working with electrical impulses in human blood that cause murder victims to rise up from the grave to seek vengeance. Well, anyone worth their popcorn can see where this one will go....Directed and written by Mario Cairano.Face it, at this price it is a steal for Steele groupies!"
2,DREADFUL TRANSFER !,"I adore Barbara Steele, but this transfer is truly one of the worst DVD transferd ever. It looks to have been mastered from a videotape without any type of effort to clean it up whatsoever. It has a constant fluttering throughout most of the film which gives the picture a quality that is NOT in anyway seamless.The box art is [bad] and this is definateley a sub par release.In comparison with SYNAPSE'S beautiful job on CASTLE OF BLOOD starring BARBARA STEELE this disc is an atrocity.THE ONLY REASON to buy this DVD is if you are such a fanatic for BARBARA STEELE that you cannot wait for someone else to put out a better copy. Surely, and hopefully, someone will. Cuz RETROMEDIA'S release would not even be competition if someone came out with an even slightly better version.I mean they should pay people to watch this disc rather than charge them."
2,"Entertaining, but not character building","These cartoons are marketed for little kids. The images, music and story lines are cleverly thought out. Of the product I would say that it is all in all well done.The behaviour that they are showing as acceptable, put me off. If you want to reinforce Christian values in your child rather getVeggie Tales: Tomato Sawyer and Huckleberry Larry's Big River RescueorAngel Wars - Guardian Force. Those are also well done.This is in essence a spreading of the message of popular pop culture and all the boundaries that goes with it."
3,Works Just Fine,"I bought this as a Christmas present for a nephew. It works fine.Overall, it feels slapped together. This is being treated as a product for undiscerning children. The packaging is cheap. The menus are unimpressive. But, its fine. There isn't anything wrong with it. Buy it with confidence."
4,An old fav when I were a kid,My little one loves it. I would get more soon. I used to watch this show when I was a bit young.
4,"And with this cartoon-y, we invade your DVD!","I'll be honest. I didn't grow up with the Tiny Toons like everyone else here. I never saw then when they originally aired, and I never saw them when they were syndicated. In fact, I only first heard about them a couple of months ago (before then, I only knew of their successor, Animaniacs). And now, I wish I had seen them when I had the chance on TV (not that it was totally possible, considering I was born in '96, and they ended in '95). For some reason, I can't get enough of their looney installments. The gags, the characters, and the animation--which is so fluid and colorful, it's just terrific--makes this show so great. I'm really hoping that Warner Bros. releases the final two seasons on DVD. I'll be waiting!(The reason I gave this four out of five stars was because the last episode of disc 4B (""A Ditch in Time""), wouldn't play when I selected it. I was only able to see it through the 'play all' feature)"
4,tiny toon adventures,I was satisfied with my order. THis was ordered as a present for my sister and she loves it.
1,Tiny Toons Is a Great Show. DVD is an abomination,"I love Tiny Toon Adventures. It's a great cartoon show, but this DVD set is an insult to any fan of the show.I am not talking about the lack of special features or the rather generic packaging. Those things can be overlooked.Rather, I refer to the fact that this set contains EDITED versions of the show!In the Tiny Toons Music Television episode the 555-Acme telephone number has been edited out! This is an insult! I paid good money for a DVD of a favorite show. How DARE they cut out portions of the program, for ANY reason. Warner Bros. should be ashamed of themselves for this offensive cut, and those responsible should be fired.If I sound angry, I am. This is a totally unacceptable action. I'm tempted to return the DVD and demand a refund.How do we get WB to replace the censored discs with correct ones?"
4,Great Memories,I used to love the Tiny Toon Adventures as a kid and apparently I still love them as an adult. I bought this DVD set for my girlfriends 5 year old and she loves it. She picks this DVD every time they have movie night. I knew what I was getting and it was the same as I remembered it as a kid.
5,Tiny Toons Adventure - Classic!,I loved this video when it was on television and now its on DVD. This is truly a classic. I wish the series lasted longer! The DVD is great and everyone will love it!
5,I love Tiny Toons!,"Tiny Toon Adventures are just as good as I remember seeing them as a child in the 90's. I'm so happy to have them on DVD at last! The picture quality is great, the Toons are loads of fun, and I just can't stop laughing!"
4,tiny toon adventures-season 1. vol. 1,"since the tiny toon adventures aired in the 90's , i have been in love with this cartoon . babs, buster, plucky, hamton and rest of the toonsters are truly wacky, crazy and funny there isn't a character i don't like . truly the tiny toons were the next generation of looney tunes."
3,Scary,"This book scared the crap out of me as a child. The images, the story are dark and nightmarish. The pictures are incredibly striking - I haven't picked up the book in years but I still remember many elements - fire licking from the sky, greyish tangling trees and flowers, the ghostly quality of the little girl. I wouldn't recommend this book for children. I don't think I've encountered anything in children's *or* adult literature since that has so disturbed me."
5,"For my daughter, Mili","I got this because I Googled ""Mili"" to see if there were any products associated with my daughter's name. This is a Grimm story that is very old. Not for everyone, but we love it! This will be an heirloom."
3,MSB Keyboardist Goes Solo,"Kevin Raleigh has a great singing voice. That was proved over and over with the Michael Stanley Band. The writer of ""He Can't Love You"" strikes out on his own here. The voice is certainly there and the songs are ok. (Includes the hit ""Moonlight On Water"") The only thing missing is the magic of the MSB guys playing with him. Not a bad effort. This is for a true MSB fan. Glad I have it in my collection."
4,Just Get Up and Do Something,"Bill motivates us to take advantage of the opportunity the Holy Spirit provides us in evangelism. But the emphasis is developing relationships with those who we are attempting to reach. You may want to check out ""Celtic Evangelism"" as well for examples of reaching out to the ""lost"". You may like the video series as well."
5,An Awesome Evangelism tool,This is great book. It really gives good strategies on evangelism and you don't feel pushy and too intrusive while still being effective.
5,inspiring,"Our church chose Bill Hybels ""Just Walk Across the Room"" for a book study and has been very well received. The book and study guide and video inspires you to be a witness and bring others to Christ."
5,Highly recommend!,"Bill Hybels shows us through example that evangelism isn't only for evangelists; that evangelism isn't especially talking on a megaphone on a street corner; but that it is living your life, listening to God's promptings; and gently taking advantage of these life encounters to share your faith in Christ. This can be done at different levels; having faith that God will provide another to complete the growth in the seeds that you have planted. I am an introvert, and I discovered that God can use me powerfully to show others that following Christ is the Way! Great reading,(& listening with the audiobook)! He leads by example. It is a blessing to see how dynamic Bill Hybels is, by allowing God to work through him."
4,A great book to encourage personal evangelism,This is an easy read with practical applications for anyone who wants to communicate a personal witness to others with sensitivity. Directions for how to write your God story is simple and easy. The church I attend is reading it for summer reading and I think applying it will make a big impact on being God's messengers in our community.
5,Excellent read,"This is a great book, easy to read, engaging, not ""preachy"". You will find yourself nodding in agreement at times, challenged at times, and motivated by Hybels' message."
3,obvious reminder,"Though it's what we ""know"", it's not what we do. Nice reminder. easy enough read. stories get a little tiring, imo. I don't need 100 examples of the same thing, personally.For a ladies Bible study group."
4,good book,This book is a great book to study a sunday school class from. I ordered 10 books and we did that. Just give yourself a couple of weeks to get it unless you want to pay more for shipping.
1,"Skip this one instead read ""The Way of the Master"" By Ray Comfort","I believe the danger of Hybels work is that it will produce false converts. Like some other reviews have stated Hybel only shares half the Gospel. The Law is a tutor that brings us to Christ (galations 3:24). Psalm 19:7 ""The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul:"" This book shows none of that. Save you time and money. If you want to learn true Biblical evangelism, the way Jesus did it, buyThe Way of the Master"
4,A practical way to reach the people around you,"Most believers are embarrassed, and non-believers are offended by the stereotype of a Christian who beats them over the head with the Bible.This book shows a different approach, in a way that respects people as individuals. Learn how to take the opportunity to reach out and befriend people, and eventually the opportunities to witness come naturally."
5,couldn't have asked for better,"The book came in very good condition, on time and was not expencive. I would use these guys again."
2,Tiny and not worth the money,"This is way smaller than it looks. And really not worth buying. One of my son's still hasn't even taken it out of the package, and he got it 6 months ago. That's how unimpressive it is."
2,Mediocre small voice changer toy.,I'm not sure who is rating this but my expectations were high for this toy based on all these raters giving this gadget 5 stars. I'm sorry to say that I don't think so. You cannot use it as a voice changer without having to record something each time. There are other voice changers that allow you to add voice effects as you speak. Not this one. That reduces the fun effect. The microphone doesn't capture the voice that well and the speakers are weak. I had to play it near someone's ear for them to hear it or tell all to stay silent. Reducing the fun even more. Some one here said that you can even clip it somewhere? No clips found. Nevertheless you can still get giggles (1st star) plus it includes batteries to play out of the box (2nd star).
2,Broken on arrival,"This was one of my son's Christmas presents. It wouldn't work when we opened it, but would repeat our words in a garbled tone. I thought it was the batteries, so we went out and purchased three more. The new batteries didn't fix it. Since I didn't think it was worth sending back, I opened it up and discovered that the wires going from the battery to the circuit board were damaged. I soldered new wires on, and it works now.It does change your voice, but isn't a great toy. He, nor his two brothers, used it very much. I tried playing around with it to get them interested in it, but to no avail. It does work, however, after replacing the defective wires."
2,A waist of money!,"Other than the few giggles from hearing your voice changed, it was just crappy! Be careful this product has expensive delivery by default! I payed (for not being careful) more than twice as much the cost of the product for its delivery!..A real waist of money! It is hardly audible and the kids get bored of it REALLY quickly!"
5,Totally fun!,"My son has several different kinds of voice changers, but this is his favorite because it is so compact and simple to use. He can carry it in his pocket easily & the batteries last forever."
2,Ehhh.,For very small children! All it does is change your pitch. It either makes your voice high or low. If your over the age of 8 or 9.... I wouldn't suggest it.
1,boring toy,NOT QUALITY. reallly boring i gave it away to some little kid i hated it it only records like 10 seconds
1,Cost got me.,Kid played with it all of 10 mins total since Christmas. Volume very low. Could have been fun if it worked a little better.
2,"Batteries were already dead. Cheap toy,","Thought this would be a fun toy for my nephew who wants to be a spy, L0,Lb.uWtas glad it included the tiny 357 batteries, but they were dead and the kid had to wait for me to get new batteries |before he could play With it. Also,they can only record about a 15 second message,"
3,Not very good,"It was alright, but all it does it record your voice and play it back very static-y and hard to understand"
3,Interested but not a voice scrambler,"We thought this would actually scramble the message, kind of like morse code. It mainly takes the original recording, speeds it up or slows it down, makes the pitch higher or lower. After we got over that, it was kind of fun."
5,Rancid~,"Love this! Hellcat Records is awesome. Found a new Fave band as well, HorrorPops.Miss you Joe Strummer. Great Job~"
4,Good price,"It's hard to find this item in stores, or from Hellcat Records merchandise. This is the cheapest I've found the DVD, well worth it."
1,huh?,"how many kits are ms. virtue going to have?! she should have said all of this in the ""Connecting with your angels kit""! even if she is gifted with angels, i think she is not giving us all the info. like she wants to give a little info for each kit and then bring out another kit. it's like drip-drip. you know that kind of ploy? i think ms. virtue wants to make tons of quick $."
5,How to give an Angel Card Reading,"I loved the Card Kit when I saw it. The cards are great to meditate with and to pray with. You can learn which Archangel to pray to for specific things that you may want. For example, abundance, love, prosperity, the possibilities are endless. And the Archangels are there to help you with anything you want. They and God want us to be happy, and they know that we will do great things for others in return."
1,Against saying this book used by homeschoolers as text.,I have homeschooled and would never choose this book as a textbook. I do not teach hate and most homeschoolers feel the same way. This is an irresponsible remark that was quoted on MSNBC who was also irresponsible in not doing better research.
5,This is the most informative and interesting book I've read.,This is an excellent book. I love history and this book has alot of history in it. It is told in a way that people can understand. It is also made very interesting. I recommend that everyone read this book. You won't be able to put it down.
5,Now I understand economics!,Excellent book. Easily understood. Have loaned it out to friends and given it as a gift. Always well received. Friends & relations have agreed that War Cycles / Peace Cycles should be required reading for all ages.
5,Required reading for all businessmen and patriots.,"Mr. Hoskins is a genius. His descriptions of usury, banking, taxes, money, economics, inflation and war are classic. You won't find this book at your library. It's not PC. University professors and the clergy are unable to refute Mr. Hoskins conclusions without lying. Liberals shouldn't read this book. It will only raise their blood pressure. If you want to preserve your own wealth, this book is for you."
3,Not for Adult Beginners,"Way, Way too hard for beginners. I'll keep it for when I am more advanced, because the song selection is interesting."
4,Good for intermediate players,"This book was perfect for me. I believe none of the pieces in the book were of the simplified versions, but nevertheless easy enough for me to play without any practicing. However the title is deceiving. Definitely not for the beginner. Must have at least 3-5 years of serious traditional piano training before one can even begin to play the pieces in this book. If you can play the original Beethoven's Fur Elise from beginning to end, then this book might be just right or somewhat challenging for you. Make sure you browse in person before you buy any printed music. That is the easiest way to tell if it is your level before plunking down the cash."
5,Why buy this...?,"I just recently picked up this DVD from my local public library, and for once I was glad I did. If you purchase one of these, you'll be stuck with this banal, generic ad that plays at the beginning. (""Ever feel like you're in a Jim Jarmusch picture?"") Also, I noticed that this version uses fewer subtitles than the European DVD, and some of Shakespeare's best lines are thrown out. But the film itself cannot be faulted for anything. It puts similar attempts at adaptation by Branagh, Zeffirelli, Olivier, and even Welles to shame. This is the only Shakespeare film I've seen where I can point to any scene and say, ""THAT's the way it happens in the play""--especially the disinterment of Yorick's skull. See it if you haven't, but be sure you've read the play first, because for all its strengths. this is no substitute for the text of Old Bill."
4,Mobled Prince,"For those who know the play, and will not be repulsed by an inartful narrative abridgement, this a Super film--more a kind of ""Impressions"", or ""Fragments"" of Hamlet, than a straightforward presentment. As if put together by a consortium of all the great black-and-white practitioners, there are stagings of great imagination and inventiveness; Wellesian, Bergmanesque, Eisensteinian camera work, and with an obvious debt to the purely visual aspect of Olivier's 1948 effort; a score by Shostakovitch of affecting operatic heft and atmospheric enhancement. Not enough close-ups, not enough reaction shots, perhaps, and the meat-axe approach to condensation can be maddening. But viewed as a 2 1/2 hour preview of a film that possibly just got hacked to death by post-production running time considerations, it's an exciting, exhilarating, experience."
4,To be or not to be?,I have viewed this DVD twice & feel that I need to view it again to evaluate it fairly. The B&W photography is excellent. The Shostakovich score compliments the screen action but draws too much attention to itself at times so that one finds oneself listening to the music more than concentrating on the play. This is probably due to my having to follow the subtitles. The experience would be undoubtedly greatly enhanced if I could understand Russian. Can one really translate Shakespeare into Russian?
4,"Edgy, Riveting, Truly Independent","This was a fully improvised feature film and the magnetic atmosphere of the moment pulls the audience in as if they are there. Intricate character plots, real life emotion & edgy, handheld camera work make this one an original. A model for the spirit of a true independent film. Worth seeing."
5,my dreams come true,"Boy this eve Locke is sure tuned into mature sexualraunchiness which I live for I'm a lesbian and Ilive this style with my girlfriend, we love the book so much we bought two so we didn't have to share."
5,This is the best turn on of all the sexy stories i've read,"It is by far my kind of language and it's very racy and graphic descriptions of every detail mesmerizes my own obscene mind. And when I open the book nothing else matters (...), i'm in a different world thanks to Eve Locke. (...)But the third lifestyle that she introduces almost drove me crazy with desires, i'm going to try it too, it seems perfect, read it and you'll be addicted like I am. Hooray for Eve Locke, I love her she's my kind of author.Sandy"
3,Brief descriptions,The stories alternate between the hooker and the nun. A page or two for one and then a page or two for the other and continuing...I'm reading just the hooker's story first. I'm halfway through. The story is very good but the sexual encounters so far are very brief... about one to one and a half pages long. I would rather have a book with longer descriptions of the intimacies.
5,"This could be true, it sure reads goods","I'm a catholic girl who at one time was in a convent and when I read this rendition of convent life I almost died of shock, not from the very wonderful sexual content but because of how close the Hooker and the Nun was to my convent life, and I love her style of describing every lewd detail, thank you Eve locke, SAINT EVE LOCKE.Theresa, an ex nun, a horny ex nun"
1,it doesn't even deserve a star,"This book was terrible! Masturbating with a state of the virgin Mary?? The constant references to the ""honey pot"" and what's with the old lady in the hospital??I am so annoyed I wasted money buying both of these books. Also, was this printed in a garage? Many type-o's throughout the book."
5,"outrageously sensual and graphicly described, lewd and racy","This is the book i've been waiting for for my entire life, (41)and now i'm so pleased for having someone (Eve Locke)as my newest love and mentor. She's the best author for my style of sexual fantasies and I hope the world appriciates her talent. I've just bought her second book The lesbian, her virgin and Ocracoke Island and it's just as good. I can now live my wildest obscenities without feeling degraded she's my kind of girl.Her descriptions are exactually what I needed for a 100% better sexlife, never mind having to have a man anymore.Grace"
5,A GOOD PRODUCT!,THE SPICY ONION WAS THE ONE I LIKED THE BEST. MAKES A GREAT LUNCH ON CRACKERS OR BREAD.
1,horrible tuna and unreturnable,"I purchased this tuna online to take with me to India. It is not good, and I would not recommend it for anyone. It is a nasty color, greasy and just bad. And it cannot be returned. Think a long time before buying this."
5,Great collection of movies.,"Always a fan of westerns, I took a chance and loved them all. Still looking for more ""Goodnight For Justice."""
3,Durability in question,"The set came as advertised, in an easy carry case and with enough markings to allow an 8 player game with no confusion. The weight is good and they roll true.. my issue is with the durability of the finish... My bocce court is putting green astroturf with appropriate levels of sand and after a single use, the bocce balls were scared and damaged. The scratches are deep and not coming out.. I can't imagine what type of surface they are designed to be used on, unless it is grass and they assume no contact with other Bocce Balls. They still work for playing the game, but at this price I expected more durability"
2,Best left forgotten,"You know you're in for it when one of the flicks (""Radar Secret Service"") was mercilessy riffed in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. This collection is (for the most part) sludge of the variety usually found in thoseMystery Classics 100 Movie Pack. At the price, it's no bargain. Most are less than an hour, so if you're looking for something to fall asleep to or want to get the gang over for a riff session, it'll do."
4,A fine read,"After reading the other two reviews of this book, I had to chime in. This book is, I think, a fantastic piece of work. It is exactly what the title says it is. Edmundson pits the theorists up against the literature they theorize about, and asks, ""Which one leaves us with a better understanding of the world and more hope for a better future?"" The answer, as you might imagine, is literature.If you have a prejudice against the notion that creative writers might know what they're talking about, and that the creative work can be read ""as theory"" itself, then this book probably won't convince you otherwise (as the other reviews make clear). But if you're intrigued by the idea that the poets might not be as bad as Plato made out, then I think you'll find the book to be nothing less than a treat."
1,More soft-core junk.,"I guess the producers think this is art because of the very limited FFN: not so. It's not art and it's not decent porn either. I wonder why the creators such crap even bother, for what it is they could've filled the entire film with money shots."
4,Funny and curiousity !,"I'm a dog lover but a lot of behaviors he/she does confuses me sometimes. The author Tom Davis wrote this book explaining in details for unbelievable 42 manners of dogs. He artfully described in funny way but I also found that some realistic explaination hidden on it. The book gives relaxation to me as I think it is for the general dog lover and interest book reader, not for reference. The author can raise up even detailed l behavior to tell us such as 'why do wet dogs always shake on you?' or some frequent question from children such as 'why do dogs come in so many sizes, shapes, and colors? !! In summary, this book reflects broader views for dog lover in relaxing method and fitted words. Frankly to say, I love my dog and understand him/her much more after reading this book."
3,Interesting Book,I really enjoyed reading this book. It had things in it about Dogs I never knew and I've been raised with Dogs all my life! I have even loaned it out and referred back to it several times! Thanks for writing it. C T
4,kupper super k,"none as a producer-remixer eric kupper give us a superb album of classical deep-house-garage type with songs like :latin blues,Atlantis,bring it back..."
3,Ladders for Dummies - NOT,"I'm a CPA, JD and member of Mensa...and a total idiot when it comes to things mechanical. (Seriously, if I were a cave person, we'd still be using sleds instead of wheels). So YMMV but this has been a bit of a disappointment for me. Yes, it's very versatile, but I haven't yet been able to get the work platform attached, despite assiduous study of the instructions. I extended it to paint near the ceiling - which was the reason I purchased this in the first place - but it felt so unsteady I couldn't bring myself to climb more than halfway up. Which left me at about the same height as my traditional 6 foot stepladder. I didn't find the written instructions very helpful but again, I'm not good at this. The LG has great reviews from people more mechanically inclined and is probably a really great ladder system; but for me, it's just reinforced the decision to search Craigslist for cheap painters."
5,Grandsons favorite.,This product has provided hours of fun for a toddler. He can use the sound buttons provided or make his own sounds while using foot power to travel around the house. It is fully assembled.
1,Worst ride-on ever!,"My son received this toy for Christmas, just before his second birthday. It is absolutely useless! It doesn't turn, so it is very difficult to ""drive"" in anything but a straight line. The wheels are so big, my son can't ride it without running over his own feet; he can only move it by taking tiny little steps. This toy might be better for a younger child, but if you have an older child that really wants to RIDE on a toy, skip this one. I'd HIGHLY recommend the Chicco Toys Play 'N Ride Train -- my son has had this for a year; he plays with it every day and it has an excellent steering mechanism so he can ride it all over the house very easily."
3,not perfect,"My son is a little over a year old, and can get on and off the toy but hasn't figured out how to move on it yet. I can sort of push him while he is on it, although I have to be really careful about holding up his feet. There isn't a lot of room between the wheels for dangling feet or for big steps.The vroom-vroom noise is fun, and so is the honking. I could do without the super-cheery singing voice button and I'd pry it off with a screwdriver if my son didn't like it so much. He likes to sit on the four wheeler and push the buttons with a big grin on his face.It doesn't ""do"" tight corners, although it can make wide turns just fine. It travels straight just fine as well, and since we use it back and forth on the sidewalk, this isn't an issue.It is pretty cool looking for a little boy, and it doesn't take up much room at all."
2,Dead puppies aren't much fun,"I first started listening to Soerba when I heard 'I am Happy' on the radio in Naples in '98; their English is so bad that it sounded like they were saying ""I am very happy because the puppy's dead"". In general the album has a fun vibe but they have no musical talent. If you want to listen to a lot of cacaphonous synth music, buy it, otherwise... Max Gazze' is fun but a lot more talented."
2,Not very good,"My opinion?A modern day American 'feminist influenced' and 'politically correct' version of Roman history.Not very good.Those professors interviewed are overpaid and under-qualified, in my opinion."
1,A waste of money,"This must be the worst viedo documentry of Roman history ever produced. Sigournery Weaver was the worst possible choice for narrator. Just read the comments below. The emperors are all villified. I can't believe the producres included a comment by one historian who compared Augustus' conquest of Egypt to Hitler's conquest of France! There is no attempt to understand Roman culture other than a superficial glance. The Romans are continually compared to fascists, and that is completely anachronistic. The video may get some praise for including the wily Ovid, the writer of satirical sexual escapades. But then Sigourney Weaver accuses Augustus of suppressing free speech, as if Augustus was a bloodthirsty tyrant.Purchase the Greeks instead, a series also produced by PBS but far superior. The cinematography is magnificant, the music is superb, and history is explored with more objectivity. It is also voiced over by Liam Neeson of Schindler's list fame and Star Wars:1."
3,"S1: Epi 1 Imaginative license, weak explanation of Christian origins, but overall a good show","Review based on Roman Empire in 1st century episode - Really base and shoddy exposition about the message of Christ and Christian origins, lots of storytelling license viz. interweaving of poets/poetry into historical tale. But an interesting tale nevertheless."
3,Misleading information may lead to bad choice here,This is a documentory that does not have the greatest re-inactments and can tend to significant dryness. This is sometimes harder to handle than what's his name in the dry-eyes commericals.
4,It really is OK,"Wow -- what a bipolar set of reviews! People seem to either love it or hate it. From my point of view, something that creates such a range of opinion must have some redeeming value. My wife and I thought that the program was fine. No single video program can cover an entire topic. Even Gibbon's massive Decline and Fall (and yes, I have read most of it) did not fully cover the events that were Rome in the first century. If one is an expert in this period you will be disappointed. For those interested in a nice introduction to this period, this program is fine. I found it reasonably balanced. It put forth some of the strengths and weaknesses of the Roman Empire -- particularly the problem of political succession, which, in my opinion, was a major factor in the fall of Rome."
4,Fun Book to use with a math lesson,"I bought this book because I found a lesson plan that used this book to teach about function rules. The lesson plan was for middle school, but with a little editing I made it Algebra I level. I kept the book as part of the lesson. The students liked the book and put the Magic Pot Function Machine to work as they studied for the test. I also read the book to my 4 year old niece and she thinks it is very funny that the old lady fell into the pot. Over all a good purchase and I will continue to read it to my high school Algebra I classes as an introduction to the lesson."
5,Another enjoyable read from Satyam Nadeen,"I remember reading this book a few years ago and just feeling really good afterwards. It is light mind freeing material.Both this and his first book 'From Onions to Pearls' are fun reads with a nice free feeling of spirtual depth.Not for everyone, but I liked and would recommend them both."
4,Almost great,"I enjoyed this book. The characters were excellent, the writing was competent and the story was great. This is the first Vance novel I've read and I went out and picked up another one the next day (not as good).The relationships with the women were weird and juvenile. He seems to be hung up on women that are inaccessible and in at least one case, underage. Creepy..? A little. Fortunately its not a deal breaker for the book.The author's intelligence carries the day and he's able to muscle through the writing. He's able to maintain a sound narrative despite the uninspiring dialogue but what the hell.. its SciFi"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The Demon Princes series is a very serious revenge story, or serieseven. Think Red Sonja, or The Executioner, or The Punisher. Each ofthese is basically novella length.A boy's family gets killed by some very, very bad men. Hisgrandfather trains him to be a killer to gain revenge. His grandfatherdies, off he goes to kill some people that aren't that easy to kill."
5,"Amazing societies, outstanding characters and plot","Vance's trademark of delightful style, bizarre yet somehow logically consistent future planetary societies, and imaginative plotting reaches a peak in the ""demon princes"" series. Some of these tales I have not read since they first came out decades ago, yet many of the characters and events stick in my mind almost as if I'd lived it myself (well, not quite... if I had gone through all that I'd be a wreck from flashbacks). Jokes, tortures, detective work, deep insights into twisted human personalities and social structure: Vance has poured everything into this. Classic and classy"
4,Just can't put it down,"I can't really put my finger on exactly how he does it, but Vance really knows how to capture your attention and keep it. The characters are vivid, the scope is sweeping, and the plots are incredibly intriguing. Perhaps most fascinating is Vance's versatility. Each chapter begins with excerpts from books, reports, and other works set in the same time. These provide an excellent means of detailing this fictional universe from outside the perspective of the main character. All in all, I found this one of the more compelling reads. I strongly recommend this book to any science fiction fan."
2,Disappointing,"Jack Vance is a great storyteller but not here. The only problem with the five novels that comprise The Demon Princes is Vance tells the same story five times. Read one - you've read them all. Same plots - same bad guys - same hero who doesn't grow. If you make it through more than a thousand pages to the ending of the fifth novel, congratulations - you'll be disappointed. I've read big sci-fi epics before - Dune, Foundation, Titan, etc. - The Demon Princes is not in their league."
2,book was ok,"This book has a lot of details about his Martial Art experiences, but very little about true Ninjutsu or the training he received and yes Shinobijutsu and martial arts are two different things, it would be like the CIA practicing Karate for most of there training it would be a waist of time. Many of the stories resemble those of other martial art masters, good book but it has a lot of fiction in it."
3,"Rogan could use an editor, but he is informative","I just finished this book, and while I found it to contain a wealth of information, I thought there was maybe too many words dedicated to the family history of Morrissey. Actually, there was more text about the aforementioned subject than there was about the actual breakup of the Smiths.Rogan would often use Smiths lyrics in what I perceive to be some sort of clever irony when discussing subject matter. I know this was done vecause Morrissey was called in the book an 'ironic plagiarist', and Rogan is just playing his little game. However, it came off as amateurish.It's pretty obvious that Rogan never talked with Andy Rourke, which is a shame, because he is an unsung hero in the band, and should have felt more slighted for not getting songwriting credits. His basslines were often what carried the tune in those songs, and he should have been treated better by M&M;."
1,Dense and hard to read,This book is not an easy read. Rogan includes way too many meaningless details. I couldn't get through it. It's worth the cost though for the pics.
5,"dont listen to ""philmarlowe39"" 's review.","Continental Op ""philmarlowe39 obviously doesn't know what it means to be a true fan of music. he claims you outgrow the smiths. you dont outgrow great music. its timeless. sure the smiths are great to listen to as a teen, but if you love and understand great song writing and melody then its always great. i get tired of hearing these older folks saying ""oh i've outgrow this band and that band"" when they mention someone like the smiths. i can understand that if your speaking of mc hammer or madonna but not a group which was as amazing as the smiths. oh and this book was great also. thanks"
4,Need Time to Study Material,"The book is excellent and adding the simulation software is an extra boost. Unfortunately I ordered the product to late and didn't pass the test on the first try, but know that I can definitely pass it when I retest."
1,Not useful with the new exam,"I prepared using this software and appeared for the exam and cleared the exam. But this software was not at all helpful with the new exam which has brand new set of questions. Also with the previous version Fastrack 4.3, we can sell it after passing the exam. But with this new version, RMC made restrictions that you can install the software only twice once in your home PC and office PC. So USD 299 is a big investment for which you dont get any return.. Total Useless software.. I am putting this comment so that no one else waste their 299 dollars."
3,"Licence of the software is hard to get, Hector Olvera, PMP","I had the fast track CD and the pmp prep book as well. I passed the PMP test and I am certified now.You need both to do well in the exam. But as someone said, they really limit the numbers of installations in your PC. They are scare and question you a lot when you have a crash in your machine.For my point of view. It is ARCAIC. Now that Rita Passed Away (sorry), I hope the change this low quality customer service.Hector Olvera, PMP[...]"
2,BUYER BEWARE,"You would think that when you spend this much money on software that you own your copy, right?? Wrong!! The software if used right away is good and provides a good simulation of the real exam. Problem is, that after 1 year your license expires and you can no longer use the CD you purchased. So in reality you are not purchasing the software you are leasing it for a year. This is something that should be VERY clearly stated for all users to know."
3,Not What I Expected!,"This product is based on the PMBOK 3rd edition, while the exam is based on the 4th edition. Apparently RMC Project will not provide you with the 4th edition questions unless you buy their new overpriced CD.Since many questions are similar (not a huge difference between 3 and 4), I felt the questions and answers are not bad. Thefefore, I don't regret buying it.Long story short, if you are interested in this product please ensure that you buy the latest version."
5,PMP Fastrack 5.2.0 led to good results.,"I used the 5.2.0 version to write the PMBOK exam for the Fourth edition. The PMP Fastrack was excellent preparation and definetly worth the money. The package arrived from the shipper on schedule and in good condition. I would recommend this software to anyone preparing for the exam and wanting to understand the format of the exam, range of questions, track their own progress on answering accurately by knowledge area, process group, etc. The fact that the answers were provided made it a great study guide as well."
3,PM FastTrack Review,"PMPFastTrack is a good tool in a sense that it will benefit you in terms of preparing oneself for the types of questions (....more of the look & feel) & other thing is that just due to the volume of question & answering process, one tend to learn in the process.PMP exam are lot harder than & objective answers are lot closer to being ambigous than the one PMFastTrack offers. Fortunately, I was just able to pass the test but not with flying colors. I was a little dissappointed with the investment of $188. Price for the questionaire should be far more affordable by at least 35% to 40%."
1,Rather outdated.,"I passed the exam by taking my friends advice of not continuing using this CD. The new PMP exam is more tough, the questions are more direct.Rita's questions are more easy but answers are very different with some irrational explanation and page # reference. The Mulcahy questions were regressive in the sense that over the period of time I started answering mulcahy way of answering which was wrong so instead of building my knowledge I was getting more confused as to what was wrong or right. At time I thought it may be a deliberate attempt to make you buy more mulcahy books or courses.Many new topics from PMBOK are not covered even though I bought the cd in April 2007. My advice would be read PMBOK, then take some online free sample test."
1,Great for spending time trying to activate the software,"I received this through a PMP exam prep class and activated it on my work laptop. Trying to upgrade to the new version that was supposed to solve all my problems was unsuccessful, so I uninstalled and reinstalled. When I tried to install on my home computer (allowed by the very restrictive terms of use), I was told I exceeded the allowed registrations.Tech support is available Monday-Friday 9-5 CST, so I wasted a planned day of studying because I cannot access the questions.Bottom line, they are more concerned about protecting their revenue stream than helping their customers get what they need."
1,Horrible Activaion process,"Horrible activation process, you cant activate this more than 2 times although it is the same person and same laptop who is doing so. I wasted my money on this and wouldn't recom'd this to anyone."
3,It's ok...,"This software was alright. I didn't pass my test using this software and the material presented by Rita. I am not sure if maybe she wasn't direct enough. She has many hidden agendas in the questions themselves that do make you think, but that overthinking didn't help on a test that was already nervewrecking. Also if you are in the beginning stages of the studying process or you are a very busy PM, this may not be the product for you. There is a time constraint on this software, it runs out after a year after you install it. (Not even Microsoft has that). So be careful. I would not recommend this software, if I had known up front that I only had access for one year."
5,The BEST tool for passing the PMP Exam -,"This was the key element that helped me pass the exam. Books, courses, study groups,...etc are all good material to cover the understand the concepts. But going through the practice tests on this CD was the single most important factor!I highly recommend this software to all who are studying for the PMP exam. There are a good number of questions on the CD. It will prepare you for the real thing! Good Luck!"
2,Great help but challanging software support,"I brought this software because I really got a lot out of Rita Mulcahy's book `PMP Exam Prep, Fifth Edition: Rita's Course in a Book for Passing the PMP Exam' which I think is excellent.This software contains a range of exam simulations which are also very helpful in preparing for PMP exams.I gave the product only two stars because the software is time bombed (it expires and cannot be reused beyond one three month extension) and can only be installed twice (designed to support two machines). I had a hard disk crash and needed to reinstall but they (the software developer) would not allow me to do this without eating my second install which I had planned to use for my desktop (as I travel and wanted the software on both). This is, in my opinion, archaic customer service and an unacceptable license limitation for a software product in this price range."
1,Software Activation Support Horrible,"This software requires activation and can only be installed on 2 computers. My company purchased this software for me, and my first attempt to activate it failed. I then gave the CD to another person in our company and asked them to try to get it activated, and it also failed. When we contacted the tech support number, they told me that because two different people tried to activate the software, we violated their EULA agreement, and would not assist further getting our software activated. We are completely fustrated by the whole process, I would recommend seeking other (less restrictive) alternatives for exam simualation software."
1,caterpillars died!,My 8 year old daughter bought this with her own birthday money and was very excited at the idea of watching caterpillars grow into butterflies! After waiting over a month to recieve the caterpillars by mail we followed the instructions carefully (don't touch the caterpillars or open the container unitl they form cocoon) all of the caterpillars died! My daughter was very sad!
5,Revealing and insightful,"This book is the first documentary that I've read that I could not put down. It offers great insight into the life of inner city school kids who struggle with so much more than the average high school student. As a student at an elite university and an LA native, I am shocked at how different the paths that lead to college are for people who might be sitting right next to each other in class. It is a must read for anybody who thinks affirmative action is unfair and who believes that everybody has equal rights in the USA. The playing field has to be leveled and this book shows you why."
5,Great Book,"This is an extremely good book. I had to purchase it for one of my social work classes, and I am very glad I read it. The students and teachers are all inspiring."
4,This is not Bowser's Sha Na Na!!,"With cuts like the almost-hit ""Only One Song"" and ""Canadian Money"", Sha Na Na stepped away from the oldies rock & novelty gig and brought out a real album. It's actually quite good. ""Canadian Money"" stems from the band's experiences on theFestival Express, an ill-fated cross-Canada rock tour."
5,You are traveling through another dimension!!!!,"These are some of the most beloved classics you can buy. The prices are a little high, but worth it! I watched for these shows to be released on dvd for years & now I own all 5 collections (156 shows). I couldn't be happier. Rod Serling was a master of his time. There are a few gliches but, that is due to the age of the film. These shows are remastered beautfully! If you have never seen the Twilight Zone I suggest you buy these classics. Don't buy them one at a time because that can run into a lot of money. Buy them in sets, (If you want the whole collection that is). I started buying them one at a time until I found out you could get them all & it cost a lot of $$$$$. I'm very happy with my collection & I watch them all the time. They will never get old!!!!!"
2,Real stinker,"Magda Konopka is a scarred and old hag who gets her hands on a drug that turns her young and booootiful. The drugs wears off and she constantly needs to seek more leaving death and deceit in her wake. I was totally unprepared to how horrible this movie is. Don't get me wrong - i expected a cheesy and campy film, but trust me when I say it isn't. In one or two scenes we get a glimpse of what this could have been (the strip scene), but on the overall this is nothing but a really bad movie and the little campy stuff there is does not make up for it. If you want a euro-criminal movie with the kind of comic and overdone elements this sort of outing needs go for Danger: Diabolik instead. Now, that is a good movie!"
1,"Actually, zero stars","This is a horrible book. It is definitely worth it to spend a few extra bucks on the Kaplan or Princeton Review GRE CAT workbooks. The practice CAT tests are a joke--they are not timed, the format is lousy, and they actually use some of the same questions over on each of the ""3"" tests. And, the program doesn't give you an opportunity to go over the questions that were missed. This is a waste of money."
3,Interesting early effort,"Disch is amazing, and no one thinks like he does. While this, his fourth novel hints at greatness under the aegis of a sci-fi pulp romance. And its really fun. A matter-transfer device splits Captain Nathan Hansard into a ghost-like being that can walk through solid matter. Told from the ""ghost"" perspective (while Hansard does not know he is ghost), he encounters others who have fallen to the same fate as they conspire to save the world from atomic destruction. While the book borrows slightly from Budrys' Rogue Moon with elements of Stranger in Strange Land, the themes within seem far from tired. Great and interesting piece in the Disch chronology."
1,JIm Bowie,"The Jim Bowie dvd is very disappointing. It is hardly visable. This item is not copied well. It is shadowed in darkness to the point that you can barely see the actors at all and forget about knowing what's happening. You truly must use your imagination. It seems that it is a good idea to rethink any purchase of the older movies if you do not have time and/or energy to get into a buy and return cycle (as I do not). In general, I have a shelf full of poor quality dvds that I waited too late to return because of my busy schedule. The question is, do you have that kind of time?"
3,A humorous read...,"The bonds of friendship might be stretched taut by Mindy's request, nonetheless, Alyssa finds herself going undercover as a stripper named Bambi at Mindy's groom's bachleor party. Her job is to keep an eye on the lucky guy and make sure he does not cheat during his waning hours of freedom. While playing Bambi, Alyssa finds herself having a fling with the best man.After one night of passion, she vanishes, never expecting to see Cooper again. Then he turns up at the wedding, and after as he watches the maid of honor dance, Coop knows he has found his Cinderella. Before he can claim her, he will have to win her. This will mean breaking through the thorny wall of pain around an abused heart, and dropping several grand on ""pets"".*** In an interesting and humorous take on old fairy tales, Ms. Minger shows how far love can go. For the auction scenes alone, this book is a good way to spend an afternoon. ***"
1,Easy read,"I was really looking forward to this story, but was disappointed. The characters are rich, but really good people, uh huh. The characters are of course beautiful/handsome. The cynical workaholic meets the woman of his dreams, chases after her, she has issues. Alyssa and Cooper's character traits changed so much, it made the storyline unbelievable and boring. The parrot was kind of fun."
4,Not your typical J-pop female musician,"I've been in Tokyo for a bit more than a year, and in general find J-pop to be overly produced, overly cute; Shiina Ringo, however, was a nice suprise. Her songs are catchy even though I don't understand the lyrics.I find the intros to most of her songs lacking, but they almost always pick up steam. Her voice has a tendency to be slightly shrill, and that needs to be avoided, but doesn't take away from this her first album.On the B-side of one of her single-cds were some nice jazz covers which I really enjoyed, too. She has talent. I definitely recommend this album."
3,My favorite Japanese female artist I've found so far,"She wrote all her songs(sounded combination of punk, pop and folk with unique lyrics - mostly Japanese with some broken English). Her voice is hauntingly charming (somewhere between Sneaker Pimps and Alanis Morissette) though the producer could've done better. It sounded somehow incomplete or indies like."
3,A Basic introduction but not complete,"This book was rated so highly that I bought it thinking that I would learn a score of information about ancient Egyptian warfare. However, this was not the case. This book only conglomerates notions of warfare that anyone could have picked up from reading at least three texts in Pharonic Egyptian history. The topic is dealt with only at a medicore level and unfortunately, does not go into enough detail about the conquests of Ahmose (the Hyksos expeller) and Thutmose III (who expanded the empire to its greatest extent). Instead I got the same old stuff: a description of the battle of Kadesh, Megido, and the invasion by the Sea-Peoples. Although, I sound harsh in this review, it is still a good book, just don't think it will answer all of your questions unless you do further research."
4,Don't buy a black one if you are in the sun a lot,It is exactly what it looks like. It is kind of smallish on my fat head but it may be because they didn't make a bigger size.Don't get a fat head. And unless you are in the jungle or whatever there is no way to wear the chin strap without looking like a 10 year old cowboy.On occasion I am told I look like a paleontologist because I have mutton chops. So maybe do grow a fat head and mutton chops and the power of both make you look smarter.Or at least someone who is always looking for grants so I can dig.
5,Sophie Scholl: The Final Days,"Based on newly unearthed transcripts detailing the real-life trial of Scholl and other figures in Germany's White Rose resistance movement, Rothemund's faithful recreation has the nail-biting intensity of great courtroom drama combined with the oppressively sad weight of actual history. Jentsch is a marvel as the committed young woman whose bravery and refusal to cower before Nazi authority seems almost miraculous. Andre Hennicke is also memorable as a vituperative judge determined to silence Scholl--forever. Nominated for a Best Foreign Language FIlm Oscar, ""Sophie Scholl"" is a chilling look at totalitarian justice and state power."
3,Good film. Heavy-handed.,"This was watchable, not a classic or unmissable. The acting was good. The story and the history behind it was absorbing.In the end, the narrative went a little heavy-handed on the righteous martyr angle. That becomes a little uncomfortable. I can see how it's satisfying to a German audience, but a non-Germans may experience a slight anxiety, depending. Thinking about the emotional responses to the film is as interesting as the film itself."
5,THIS is What Courage Is!,"I am quite familiar with the story of ""the White Rose"" group in Munich during WW2. This movie is quite haunting and yet inspirational in its simple way of laying out the story. Starting with the printing of the 6th leaflet, to their arrest, interrogation, trial and subsequent excution she emerges as a German Joan of Arc. Most of the material in the story are from archives from the former East Germany and the writer and director let the story unfold without pressure or over dramatic sentiment.During her interrogation you see the shift of power from the interrogator, Herr Mohr to her.The courtroom scenes really capture the infamous Nazi judge, Roland Freisler. Some have criticized this actor's over the top performance. No, the real Freisler was as bad if not worse the the film.I too drew some similarities between comments made about resistance in the 40's to today.This film should be shown in every school to show whatreal courage is."
5,A must see film,"I found this movie to be a truly great film. I have watched it several times and found it fascinating every time. One of the more interesting things to me was that the dialog was not made up. The Germans kept meticulous records of everything they did, like counting the buttons on the clothes of people going to the gas chambers. They also recorded every word spoken by her, her interragator and her trial which brings a realism to the film that you don't find in many others. This is not an action film or a film with blood and gore. It is very disturbing, riveting film about what it was like living in Nazi Germany. There is actual film footage of her trial in the extras. I'm not sure I could do what this young woman did. A true story of quiet courage from a young woman who dared stand up to the horrors of a brutal, unrelenting tyranny. A must see!"
5,Subdued Horror,"This is a brilliant film, which should be shown regularly.Julia Jentsch gives a subdued and controlled performance in a understated film. The director deepens the horror of Sophie Scholl's predicament through a methodical presentation of her examination and trial.The overall emotion of all the players is fear and the director conveyed that fear convincingly in his almost zen-like approach to the banality of the police and judicial system, which leads the viewer and Sophie to the singular mechanical horror of the guillotine."
5,Excellent Movie - true story,This is a very moving story of young Germans fighting the Nazis by spreading the truth of the situation. I recommend this highly.
5,EXCELLENT!!,"A truly brilliant movie! For an excellent, truly gripping and straight to the point-look at this important part of history (especially for those whom don't know much about it yet), I'd truly recommend viewing this, followed immediately by ""Downfall""."
2,I'M NOT SURE,WHAT I EXPECTED BUT THIS WAS NOT THE COMPELLING STORY I WAS EXPECTING. I WILL ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION OF NAZI DVDs.
2,Unrealistic and childish,This movie is like a high school play. Everything seems too simple and unrealistic. Case in point: Gestapo interrogators did not offer cigarettes and coffee to their suspects.
4,Other better movies,"While the acting was good and the movie generally interesting, it was not gripping. Better movies of the same type are ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,"" or even ""Bonhoeffer: Agent of Grace"" and ""In Tranzit"""
5,Very informative,We are Living near Munich right now and have been to the memorial. It was helpful to see story. Thank you!
5,WOW...,"This is an unforgettable story. Powerful, well acted, well done all the way through. The fact that it's in German and subtitled doesn't detract from the movie at all; it just gives it a more authentic feel."
1,Boring,"After one hour I couldn't take any more, so maybe I missed some excitement. This woman is sitting in a Gestapo office, under arrest, drinking coffee and chit-chatting endlessly - endlessly - with a Gestapo agent about German political issues of the 1940s. I imagine some creative genius pitching this script by saying, ""It's like My Dinner with Andre, but Andre is a Gestapo agent and it's an interrogation conducted over coffee."""
5,The White Rose,"I do wish the earlier film (1982), ""The White Rose"" were available on DVD. I have a somewhat washed-out VCR copy. It traces the group over a longer period of time than does the ""Last Days"" film, and is a marvelous treatment of this amazing group's activities."
4,Great little starter set,"My 11 year old son is pretty fickle, so when he told us he wanted a drum kit, we hesitated. This one is small, but built well. The seat is too small for my 1 year old, so he uses a different seat. My husband and I put it together fairly easily. For the price, I think its a great kit to see if its something our son will want to stick with. A friend of ours who is a drummer said the sizes are just fine too."
1,IF IT SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE...,"DON'T BE FOOLED. It's a $20 laser level, and it works like a $20 laser level. Don't waste your money, it's just not even remotley accurate"
3,Music Wonderland,"Land of hope and dreams interested me because of previous cds and tapes I,ve bought in the past of Mike RowlandWas a little disappointed I expected a fantasy of special effects with spirit and elves,the photos with the music backing was ok expected a little moreIf Mike does another one of these dvds take us on a journey with the special effects with the music of Fairy Queen,Silver Wings and the magicial Elfin Im sure it would then be the biggest hit of 2008"
2,Stiff,Bought them for work but they were not comfortable...like walking on cement. Other skechers shoes are much much better. I wear skechers work shoes now.
4,Okay,"I purchased this directly from Amazon in 2007. It cost $45 back then, and came within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping (which is basically standard shipping).It looks exactly like the picture. The size fit correctly. Nothing was damaged during shipping, and it was all new material. I only gave it four stars because the sneaker is a bit stiff, and also it feels a bit too heavy for running or walking extended miles, or playing sports. I bought these because I am a walker, but they wouldn't make good walking shoes (I think the inch of platform on the sole makes it a bit heavy). They are durable though, had them for a long while and still wear-able."
3,"a ""groovy"" mix of cross-cultural sounds...","hey,dig!i just heard this disc and i think it's a cool mix of world-ethnic and mellow dance beats. my favorite being ""PEACHES"" and the seque into ""MALAWAY"". Hope to hear more from this group in future!!"
2,Some fun moments but alot is forgettable,"Dario G is a British Dj that got some attention in 98, with especially ""Synchyme"" and Carneval de Paris"" the song for the football world cup, a very good song with a nice melody and a mix of diffrent instuments, drums, and a changing tempo. It was a perfect choise for the world cup with so many countries in, the song could be identified with many nations. Many of those songs have been used before ""Sunchyme"" was based on ""Life in a Northern Town' from the Dream Academy's and ""Carneval de Paris"" the song from world cup 1998 was also using samples from another song i think. The title track ""Sunmachine"" was a decent, dancable club song too, but there the fun ends. Most of the other songs are forgettable and not that good either. ""peaches"" sounds like a typical club song. ""Malaway"" is slightly better with a voice saying something i don't get. I haven't heard much of Dario G since but i still hear ""Carneval de Paris"" in diffrent occasions."
3,Has its charm and its smarm,"I'll agree that there are two good tracks here: Sunchyme andCarnaval de Paris. But the fact that the latter includes both anaccordion AND bagpipes deserves two stars by its own merit. Very nice. The others are harmless, simple, and by no means unpleasant. The melodies have the simplicity of trance without forcing it on the listener (good or bad depending on taste). The title track is absolutely inane.... This is decent, but no classic. END"
4,"While not brilliant, a good escape","Interesting mix here, folks. I love most of this album, and that is why I can only give it four stars.Sunchyme is an eye-opening tune, one that will have you putting ""repeat"" on it over and over. Carnaval de Paris is a good eclectic mix of sound. Voices is a trancendental piece, you could sleep to it.The rest sort of leaves stuff to be desired. A good effort, and I love the concept of trying something new, but Dario G has sort of missed the mark... if you like this, try Way out West, a better mix of eclectic tunes, some that leave you dancing and some that leave you wondering..."
4,New Narnia...same Truth,"Jonathan Rogers obviously loves C.S. Lewis' world of Narnia (see ""The World According to Narnia""), and decided to create another fantasy world where kids and adults alike can see many ""heart issues"" of life portrayed in a creative way. The Secret of the Swamp King (Book 2 of the Wilderking Trilogy) is a great read for kids as they can imagine themselves in the shoes of Aiden Errolson. Aiden is the main character whose life is followed on his many adventures and challenges through his life in The Realms of Corenwald. Though he lives in a world totally foreign to the reader, it is very easy to relate to his troubles and joys during his journeys.The book is a great link for the trilogy, leading to the more impressive climax in the 3rd book, ""The Way of the Wilderking"".Well worth the time, especially to read with/give to kids."
2,subtitles?,"This is such an impressive story with beautiful cinematography. I also saw this movie with subtitles many years ago and I have never forgot it. I was so excited to receive the dvd as a Christmas gift, then soooo disappointed when there weren't any subtitles."
5,Faithful to the book,"A beautiful film and very true to the masterpiece by Alain-Fournier. This is a great love story but, unusually, written from a male perspective: a young man finds ""the ideal woman"", loses all trace of her, then finds her again after many adventures and misunderstandings. Brigitte Fossey is perfect in the role of Yvonne de Galais.The scenes where the hero, Augustin Meaulnes, gets lost in the mist and stumbles upon the wedding festival at the lost domain perfectly recapture the magic and mystery of the novel.Time to do a new release with subtitles to make this production available to a wider audience."
5,Possibly the greatest album of all time,"If you are an SY fan you already have this album and love it. If you have heard some of the critical aclaim over this band and are curious - buy this album first. Listen to it and absorb it. When I listen to this album, the sound reaches deep inside to a place no other music has been. When I was first introduced to this band in 1987 by this album, I was awakened from musical ambivalence. This album speaks as though directly written for me. I know many other fans share the same opinion. This album has been creditted with inspiring much of the alternative scene of the early nineties, yet it stands the test of time on its own. It is as fresh today as it was back in '87."
2,"DON""T BELIEVE THE HYPE!","If you've already heard Daydream Nation don't waste yr time on this. First let me say that I AM a Sonic Youth fan. Daydream Nation is my favorite rock album and EVOL is damn close. The problem with this record is a.) none of the melodies can compete with ""Starpower""(the best song on Evol) or anything on DN. Problem b.) is that the production is the worst I Have EVER HEARD. I like lo fi recordings-Velvet Underground's White heat Light has the coolest sound ever-but Sister's production covers all the jangling guitas and harmonics with a boring warm sound. The band's playing also sucks-""Hotwire my Heart"" is one of the crappiest songs I've ever heard. The record isn't a throw away though because ""Schizophrenia"" and ""Kotton Krown"" are gorgeous despite the production. But 2 songs for $15-it ain't worth it. Stick with Daydream and EVOL."
1,one star too many.,"I find this record to be so bad, that I actually listen to it from time to time, to figure out if I'm wrong. This record is so bad its unreal. It should be used for some functional purpose, like killing rats, or as punishment for burglars or something. There are no tunes. There is no production, the band have no idea what they're doing. Get 'Dirty' or 'Washing Machine' instead."
5,Sonic maelstrom,"If you are new to Sonic Youth, get this and EVOL first, then go onto Daydream Nation. Sister finds the band completely in sync with each other and creating catchy, punk-infused songs with a lot of room still allowed for textural experimentation. Steve Shelley's drums also have a unique sound courtesy of the production, and Lee Ranaldo's obligatory addition (the oddly titled Pipeline/Kill Time) totally rips. Just get it."
3,Sonics still youthful,"3 1/2Although I certainly prefer my Sonic Youth a little further down the line, this could be considered good quality early work, when the band had begun to master sculpting their signature eruptions of guitar distortions into greater beings then themselves. The playing and recording is appropriately sloppy, though more often then not genuine power still shines through."
5,The Best SY Album,"The guy from ""Sad Young Man On a Train,"" an incredible band, worked at Olsson's Records in Alexandria (VA) when this came out, and recommended it to me wholeheartedly. Probably the best recommendation I ever had, an absolutely incredible, unique album (and I got the huge ""human size +"" Sister poster too!).I went back to Olsson's a year later and asked the guy about ""Daydream Nation,"" and he said, shaking his head, ""They've sold out.""!! I don't agree with that, but to me Daydream Nation is a little more ""mainstream,"" and the following LPs ""Goo,"" ""Dirty"" and etc. are worth listening to, but I don't feel the need to hold on to them. ""Sister"" to me was Sonic Youth's peak."
2,Not legit,"Benzoyl Peroxide is benzoyl peroxide, you can get it at walmart for about $3.50. The pills do not work/ It's a bunch of herbs that have no impact on acne."
2,One part acne cure,"I'm in my twenties so I was using this to get rid of minor breakouts. The pill/vitamin portion of this is bologna and the cream is just your average benzoyl peroxide you can buy in any drugstore for less, if you get the store brand. Its all the same stuff, don't fall for this marketing ploy. I gave it Two stars because its not worthless just BS markup"
2,10 bucks for cheap markup Benzoyl Peroxide,"I purchased this because of all the 5 star reviews but now I feel like a fool for falling for this deal. This is just your average vanishing cream plus sugar pills. I read some of the reviews on other sites and they have some of the same exact people posting the same reviews for this product as on amazon. What I want to know is how much these people are being paid to give positive reviews for a mediocre product. If you feel like paying 10 dollars for something you could get for $4 at a drug store, this product is for you."
1,Didn't work for me.,"So many positive reviews on Amazon so I had high hopes for this product. I've been using it for the last three weeks and I've had no improvement. My acne and skin is exactly the same since I've started using it. Perhaps it's my skin type but for me, this product was ineffective. The cream does a good job of drying out your skin. In fact, I think the cream is more effective then the pills were. Hopefully others have better luck with this product."
4,Helps Clear Up Acne,This product worked pretty well for my boyfriend who I purchased it for. He doesn't really have a bad acne problem so I'm not sure how well it would work for someone who really has it bad. But it's good for someone who just has sporadic breakouts.
5,Amazing Product!,"I can't believe how well this works! My son has suffered with acne for a couple of years. We have tried a lot of products, of course the most popular ones and none of them worked. I started to research various products online. I came across Nature's Cure and decided it was worth a try. I mean if it didn't work I was only out $11 and I would continue my search for a product that would clear up his acne with out horriable side effects. So far he has only taken the medicine for a week and the results are truely amazing!! His acne is clearing up very quickly and he has no new outbreaks. Not only has it made a difference in his skin but he smiles a lot more! I can't believe this product isn't advertised more because I wish we would of found it sooner! I would recommend it to everyone!!"
5,cant say enough good,"my son has acne. im sorry, my son HAD acne!!! 3 days and EVERY SINGLE PIMPLE IS GOOONE!!!! will buy this product forever!!!!"
4,Well worth it,"I bought this product because i had severe acne. i had tried multiple products before but none made a difference.after taking this product, i noticed a difference. not only physcally but mentally. Now I didnt feel stressed about the medication because it is not complicated at all to take. Just take the pill and you dont have to worry about cleansers, toners, etc. I would really reccommend this product and the best part is that it is not as expensive as other products."
5,THANKS!!!!,"It works for me. I combine it with ""Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash"" and I saw incredible results in only one week! I am super happy!!! I will keep on using this product since this is the only one that has worked for me!!! Of course keep in mind that what works for me might not work for you. But even though it is a good product to try."
1,Garbage,"Product did not work, waste of money! based on reviews i gave it a try and i was completely disappointed!"
5,Best Worst Movie,Fight scenes = awesomedialogue = ridiculousplot = unresolvedAny movie that ends with 40 minutes fight scene during which you forget the plot of the movie deserves a 5 star rating in my book.
3,Excellent Book,This book covers just about everything from organizing your desk to creating and implementing your business. The only downfall I saw that it did not cover bookkeeping of your business. It talked about finding capital and payment options but no accounting.
3,wrong link to download for this item,"Please beware. the download link on this item is incorrect and points to a different set of Tchaikovsky Symphony performances from the ones shown for the Testament CDs. The actual Testament CDs are great, from a generally relatively under-appreciated conductor."
5,OH PLEEZE,"Too many YA writers copy each other and then copy their own selves, but not Sallie Lowenstein. Who writes like her? NOBODY, becuz she is about 90 degrees twisted and executes her own artwork and is so fearless about it all, not caring if she's inside or oustside of the approved box---HUH! What can you say about a guy who has to adopt a whole house full of dolls and action figures who are really alive? That's not the ending of the plot, only the middle. If I ever find a guy like this I'll marry him."
3,A good read if you have been to St Andrews,"George Peper is no Herbert Warren Wind, but his book is an enjoyable read for those who have spent time in St Andrews."
5,"Great, interesting, funny : you live un st. andrews","Thanks George Peper!!!!:For one of the best golf books. Its as if I was actually there.I can`t wait to go to the ""OLD COURSE"" and expirience the magic you narrated in your book.The srtucture of the story (expirience)is wonderfull and adictive.You read the first page and want to keep on reading till you can barely keep your eyes open.If you love reading and golf this book is a must read."
2,A trifle,"I found it enjoyable to imagine myself in the author's shoes (I'm green with envy), but this book is little more than George Peper's holiday missive to friends and family (with lots of name-dropping). Other than the chapter describing 20 ways to get onto the Old Course (which was nothing more than filler for an issue of GOLF Magazine), it provides no insight into golf or life or anything else. It's a trifle, really."
3,Shallow and disappointing,"I purchased this book on a recommendation while ordering ""Tommy's Honor"" through Amazon. If ""Tommy's Honor"" was a stroll around the Old Course, ""Two Years"" was a heavy laden trudge thru a muddy field.My daughter spent four years studying at St Andrews and that provided a good excuse to visit. Beyond the golf, I enjoyed late night walks aroud the town, visits to the pubs and swimming in the rich local history. My daughter graduated in 2005 and we spent most of the summer in the flat she had shared with her roommates. Its very probable that I passed the author on the street.This book includes tedious packing lists and innocous names but outside his own flat, the R & A, and the Old Course disappointing little about the town itself or surrounding Fife. The author peppered his writing with often sophomoric remarks that were meant to humor but I found entirely flat.I very much wanted to enjoy this book but was greatly disappointed."
3,Simply a nice CD,"I've had this CD for quite some years now and I don't play it that much, but every time I do I am remembered of what a nice CD this actually is. You could describe it as ""soft-rock"" with a bit of country. Good compositions, well played and sung (although I'm not too thrilled about the drums, they are a bit too pronounced for my taste). And what I first noticed when I bought it were the awesome guest-musicians (Steve Lukather, Neil Young, Danny Kortchmar, Mandy Meyer, Mike Porcaro, Leland Sklar and Waddy Wachtel to name a few) and thought that this couldn't be a bad CD. It's worth to give it a try. And I myself should play it a bit more often I guess..."
4,Classical Economies Did Not Exhibit Modern Economic Behavior,"Finley in ""The Ancient Economy,"" presents an informed argument against the notion that ancient civilizations exhibited ""modern"" market behavior in the style described by Erich Roll as ""an enormous conglomeration of interdependent markets."" M. Rostovtzeff's notion that trade of manufactured goods was active and important in classical economies is successfully challenged, and the reader is given an interesting peek into the process by which free, landed peoples gradually replaced slave labor in the hinterlands laying the foundation for medieval serfdom. This is an excellent (and concise!!!) introduction to the economic structure of the classical world both describing the various class structures and how each class in general viewed the economic notions of land, capital, trade, and accumulation. I definitely recommend this book to any student of economic history."
2,Not much of an economist,"Finley may be a great classical scholar, but his application of economic theory is flawed. Somebody should have taught him about money supply and velocity. Finley's major thesis is just wrong."
2,Not happy!,"One of quite a few cd's I've purchased over the last few months from Amazon (who, apart from an ordered book that arrived with the last however many pages missing! are usually pretty good), this one failed to please. Not the actual music, mind you, but the quality of the cd, the fact that some of the pieces end very abruptly (smacking of a bad home recording)and the jacket was a mere card wrap-around rather than a proper, protective case. Disappointing!"
3,A full year before 911,"Guess what: A movie about a terrorist crashing planes into buildings. Moreover, the NSA blames a muslim terrorist group for this unprovoked attack! How does it sounds? If you said that this is a movie about 911, you would be very wrong! This movie was completed before (yes, before) September 11, 2001. And they say that reality does not mimic art (I use the term loosely)!Although it is hard to imagine such a film in a US theather anytime soon, you can get the DVD here at Amazon. The whole thing is not so good, but it deserves recognition. It is a sort of ""Airport"" for the new milenium. Anyway, who cares? Just the fact that it was completed before 911 is worth the buy.Get it before it is banned!"
2,"great intensity,but the horrible CGI riuns it (1.5/5)","normally,i would say i loved this movie.not for acting,although thatwas OK.not for the script,which was so-so.the reason i would havenormally loved this movie is for the intense action,which starts fromthe get go and doesn't end until the final credits roll.but,the problemwith this movie,and i felt it was a big problem,was the horrible CGI.itlooks like they ran out of money and couldn't complete the the effectsshots. a lot of the effects look lime they are in their very roughestform.since it is obvious they didn't have enough money to finish themovie,they should not have released it.i actual found the effectsinsulting.it seems obvious they didn't care about making a decent endproduct for the consumer.if it weren't for that,i would give this moviea much higher rating.my vote for Air Panic is a 1.5/5"
5,I love this book!,"Lisa Jones perfectly captures what it feels like to be a young adult searching --for love, friendship, and your own real life. Not the life your parents thought you would have, not even the life that you expected to have, but the whole messy, confusing, heartbreaking, yet thrilling reality. The best part is that she captures this feeling in such a light, funny way (with great dialogue!) that you don't even realize what amazing wisdom is packed into 120 pages. So read it once for the fun and a second time for the message, then tell all your friends!"
5,Loved IT! Where's the follow-up novel?,"This was a fun, quick-read. Without having much in common with the main character (thankfully), I could certainly relate to her! I laughed out loud! I'm looking forward to Ms. Jones' next novel!"
4,A crisp blend of lyricism and white man's blues,"Between Us is a departure from Murray's lush productions, Say It Ain't So and Voices. Working with super-producer Rupert Hine, he's pulled out the unexpectedly edgy, ""Rubbernecker,"" and ""Sorry I Love You."" ""It's So Hard Singing The Blues"" doesn't have the gut punch required of blues, but its spare production is a nice counterpoint to the few lyrical songs on the album, ""Good Old Days,"" and ""Lady I Could Serve You Well,"" among them. Gavin Wright's string arrangements add grace to ""Lady,"" and ""Countryman."" But the strings also screech and cascade in the unnerving, cathedral-echo of ""Sorry I Love You."" This song is one of the few times when Murray soars to the tortured heights he reached as Judas. The album finishes with the partying ""Bye, Bye, Bye."" If you are familiar with either Anthony Head or Rupert Hine's speaking voice, you can try to pick them out at the end."
3,A GREAT TOY...At least in theory,"I had such great spectations when I ordered this for my 4 year old girl, it sounded like the best toy of all times...at least that's what all the reviewers tell you.Indeed, it is a very nice toy, very clever, and heck, if it has anything to do with reading, well, what more could you ask for?When I gave this to my daughter, she was absolutely crazy about it...for like a couple of hours, AND THEN, she said those feared words: ""I'm bored"". I gave her another book & cartridge, and the ammusement this time lasted only for about 20 minutes.I do believe this is a nice toy (I sure would have loved to have something like this as a kid), BUT, do not believe all the hype that surrounds it. Sooner than later, your child will also get bored of it."
4,Reader is great; wish the books were as durable,"I've had the pink Learning System for a couple of years now and it's great. My kids were playing with it a few hours ago. It's been dropped, banged around, moved, you name it and it still works great.Be aware though that the spiral bound Leap Pad books are not nearly as durable. All of our books have ripped; I believe each one is missing at least one page.So if you're planning to invest in a Leap Pad system and the books, you should know that you'll be replacing books fairly often but you won't need to replace this system."
2,Mediocre,"In a book designed to discuss the mythology surrounding [Robert] Johnson, it seems odd to begin with an information-dump polemicizing against the revisionist practices of the post office."
4,"Experimental film and ""avant garde"" at its best.","If you're into experimental filmmaking either making them, or watching them- this is a great compilation. By one of the best of our time-- Broughton is considered by many to be the father of West coast experimental filmmaking. This disc set offers the gamete of what Broughton has to offer-- full of surprises and things you would never expect. He was truly a master at ""following his own weird"" as he used to advise!"
4,"Maybe the best Series ever, but product not the best","What holds this set back from a full five stars are the audio glitches. Along with the Game 1 ten-second delay, there is another game where the audio is a little off from the video. Speaking of video, the video quality of the games are generally good, however there are some exceptions. I'm glad that MLB is releasing these classic World Series games on DVD. This one is very good, without the audio mistakes this is an easy five stars."
1,recorded in SLP :((,"An entertaining 'in your guts' movie, but recorded at the slowest possible VCR speed, thus resulting in a poor quality tape. Shame on the production facility [...] for not mentioning the fact in their product description."
5,Great book!,"This is a wonderful book! It would be a wonderful gift to anyone interested in preserving family stories!The questions are written as a child interviewing a grandparent. Question examples include: ""What was one of your greatest adventures when you were small? Tell me about it"", ""How did you and grandmother/father meet?"", ""What's one of the most mischievous things my parent ever did?"" and ""How do you think times have changed between your childhood and mine?"" There are hundreds of questions from just about every topic you could imagine. My book also came with a pull-out family tree where I can record my own family line.Every family should own this book!"
1,Poor quality and design,"The ""arms"" of this towel holder are for too weak to accomplish their designed task. The first holder broke within 2 days. The towel roll tends to jump out of the ""cradle"" created by the arms: a serious pain to have to keep mounting and remounting the roll."
4,Love This!,I started using this product 3 almost 4 years ago and my face was clearer than it has ever been! The walmart store I do my shopping at though stopped selling it so I went a long time with out it until now. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and my face hasn't cleared up right away like other people have claimed but after a month or so it starts working very well at least from when I first used it. Like everyone else has said the cream is very harsh but I use it when my face still feels oily or greasy after washing it or on pimples I still have. It drys them up fast and stops them from getting worse. This product is a few dollars cheaper at walmart than here and I'm glad to say they finally brought it back recently. It's nice to know I can still get it here though if they're out of stock at the store.
5,Daughter Loves This Item,My daughter loves this acne treatment. She uses it faithfully. It is an excellent price compared to others on the market. She has been using it for 2 years.
4,teenage acne,I bought this product for my teenage daughter who is having quite a problem with acne. The first couple of weeks she did not notice a difference but then things kicked in and it has been helping considerably.
2,no luck,"It's nice to see that others have had success with Nature's Cure tablets. I took the pills each day...morning and night...and it was if I had never taken it. I had zero improvement. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the product is fairly priced, it didn't make my acne worse, and when you have acne it is worth it to try out. I have had total success since with both Proactiv and University Medical's product Acne Free. Good luck!"
2,Wish it would've worked,"I've seen plenty of favorable reviews on this product, but it just did not do anything for me. Neither the pills or the benzoyl peroxide improved my acne at all. I used this for a total of 3 months, I made sure I gave myself enough time to really allow the medication to get into my system. In the end it turned out to be like any other OTC acne treatment for me. I suppose it's worth a try though."
5,Finally!,"Do not waste your money any longer trying one thing after the other. I have been using this for two months now and it absolutely works! I have had bad scarring acne since I was a teen, even going to the dermatologist could not clear it up. After 13 years I can finally say bye bye to embarrassing acne and look forward to not getting anymore scars thanks to this product."
3,Helped but didn't completely clear; try body spray instead!,"This product reduced my acne by about 75% after two full months of use, but it never completely cleared it even after 4+ months. However, this company's other main product, the BODY SPRAY, did clear me up totally when used on my face (and body), after only about 2 weeks of use, and has kept me clear for over 2 months!"
2,Didn't work for me,I tried this product for 2 months and i have to say it didnt do anything for my acne. I am the type that breaks out when my period is about to start and using this pill didn't change a thing. I broke out just as i normally would and this last month even while using the pill was nearly the worst i've had. I'm sure must just be a coincidence. I am not saying this is not a good product as we have to keep in mind one thing can't and won't work for everyone as we all have different skin types. This just isn't for me and i have discontinued using this product and cannot really recommend it.
1,Did not work at all for me,"Do not waste your money, if you have acne, go to see a Doctor. I ordered this product because I did not want to go to see a Doctor, I used the cream and the pills. My acne did not go away at all."
3,It's Norm!,"Norm MacDonald is an acquired taste in comedy.Watching one show after another can get tiresome, but spread out viewing can be fun."
4,Finally! DVD for my Norm fixation!,I'm a huge fan of Norm Macdonald. I've been wondering for years why hasn't this series been out. Glad to see this finally going to happen. Gigohead from [...]
1,"Absolutely beautiful, but clasp is a disaster!","I love Burberry and wanted this watch for a while. I finally bought it and was thrilled to see how nice it looked on ... One problem: It wouldn't come off! The clasp was out of line and it took almost 5 minutes to get it off. The second time I wore it, all was fine. The third: It was stuck so badly, and it took so much effort to try to get it off, my wrist and hand actually began to swell. I ended up needing a pair of pliers to get it off. Overall, its possible I just got a bad one, but at least one other reviewer mentioned problems with the clasp (although not as severe as mine). I ended up returning it and went for something else."
2,looked like another cologne from Chanel,"My daughter-in-law chose this on her list for a Christmas gift but when she received it, it was not the one she was wanting to get.It looked like the one she wanted but was not the same. Then the company was no longer with Amazon so we got stuck with the wrong cologne because I bought it early before Christmas so it had been too many months past for Amazon to do anything about it."
1,"actually, only $6",The list price is not even close to correct. It's $60 on the chanel website so really you are only saving $6. Kinda shady if you ask me...
2,Here we go again......,...yes ladies and gentlemen....another punk compilation. No. I dont own this one. I just wanted to comment on the USUAL punk comp. thing....mostly english bands and Im happy to see the UK SUBS here (YEAA!) but c'mon people....WTF is BOW WOW WOW doin on a PUNK CD??!! ...this is TV punk.....garbage for 13 year olds.....in 1982.BUT...the Buzzcocks are on this one AND the New York Dolls... So....yea a few goodies....just seems ....zzzzzzzzz...
5,The best of the Froggy Books,"My kids loved the froggy books, and now my grandchildren do. It takes a reader who can fill in the words, and, most important, be silly while doing so."
4,Much cheaper,Glad I bought this book. It's cheaper than buying all four books. Plus you don't have to wait for another book.
5,Ornate Pictorial Calligraphy,Beautiful examples of flourishing done by old masters. It also has 12 pages of basic instructions on flourishing. Definitely a book worth having in your collection
1,horrible book,no calligraphy in it at all very disappointed in this buy.... just a bunch a lil birds.... .. .. .
4,Every show must end...,"sometimes in victory and sometimes in sadness. Chrono Crusade falls into the latter and that what the animators wanted I guess. The actually Manga had a somewhat happier ending of sorts, but this show decided for the harder type.A rather tough one to watch too often. Was it worth it in the end? I still can't quite figure that one out just yet."
5,Finally! What has been waited for!,"It finally came to be that the viewer was told what was truly happening and the action came right at the same time. This dvd gives what I personally was waiting for in this series. There are a few surprises here and there as well. Overall, i say this is the best other than the first of the six so far, much better than the last few. Can't wait for the last."
1,Annoying,"While the sound is natural, it contains a terrible echo. Reminds me of a slow waterfall inside a cave. The track loops about every 8 minutes with a fade out, then it comes back full force. Too many flaws to be relaxing."
2,"New age music spoils this one, but it's still relaxing","I was looking for environmental storm sounds to help me fall asleep. This would be great for a massage, though."
3,What the ...,"This product is really weird because, this is not season 1, it is just the first 8 episodes of season 1 on one disc. At first I thought that season 1 only had 8 episodes, but not true. Season 1 has 22 episodes. The show is great, that gets 5 stars. I just don't understand why this product is sold this way. Why not include the whole season 1. It get 3 stars because I felt short changed.There is another version of this product which is the complete series, and includes 4 disc."
4,Great value product,"Price pfister products, in my opinion are as good as a lot higher priced products. This preticular valve is no different. I have installed over 100 of this same rough in valve and have only had 1 call back for problems in 5 years (not even the fault of the valve). The trim on this sets easy to install, looks nice, and stays looking nice and clean. I have this in my own house and am ordering 2 more for my next house now. I believe this to be a great product for the money and would recommend it to anyone ready for trouble free use."
2,Price Pfister Shower/Tub Faucet,"Disappointed in the apparent quality. It looks nice on the internet; however, the tub faucet is plastic. Unsure yet how this will hold up."
1,Not Recommended,"I bought this steering damper for my '02 F350 Powerstroke. This was the recommended replacement for my truck according to Amazon and the manufacturer website; however, it did not fit properly. The included hardware was not correct and the cylinder wouldn't fit properly. I would NOT recommend this product. I bought the Moog sway bar links as well and they worked perfectly...the steering damper was a different story."
3,it was okay,"The product arrived very quickly, but only one of the actual plants grew. I followed every single direction perfectly. But I did contact Dunecraft and they promptly sent me new seeds :)"
2,The life as a depressing thing,"I think that Mr. Leigh is a truly good director. His work is honest, not common in cinema show.But, ""All or Nothing"" is really depress movie. From the begginning to the end. All is full of problems. It's like a clichè: poor people, weak people, unsmart people, unhappy people, unsane people, violent people, fat people, ugly people.C'mon Mr. Leigh: life's not too good, but on the other hand, it's not too bad. Please put your great gift in the other side of life and you give us a smile¡ You can do this¡"
4,depressing but good,"Like many films from Leigh, you probably don't want to watch if you're feeling down. It's not a light film or an uplifting one. But, I thought it was very well done and acted and believable. Is it an accurage reflection of working-class life in the UK? I don't know. But, it's worth watching as a well-done film."
5,Mike Leigh,"Sharply acted and finely tunes, ""All or Nothing"" is another of British director Mike Leigh's look at the lives of the British working class. Plotting here more or less takes a bit of a back seat to character development and a s bleak as some of the goings on can be it is breathtaking and unforgettable when redemption finally kicks in.The film is not always an easy one to watch, and if you are new to Leigh you might want to start with ""Secrets and Lies,"" ""Career Girls,"" or, if you can find a copy, ""High Hopes."" If, however, you are already a Leigh fan, this one is for you."
5,Stunning!,"I chose a 5-star rating because this headband is exactly what I was expecting, very comfortable and so beautiful! I would highly recommend this headband as a gift or for yourself and if you're a fan of silver it's a must have!"
4,Sonic Youth: Amazing from the Start!,"This is essentially the first Sonic Youth album, but it sounds so much like some of their later work you would be hard pressed to notice. It's a lot more dissonant and full of noise, but if yo ulose yourself in it, you can find a lot of melody and texture underneath. Not the best SY album to start with, but a great one to check out after you've got 3 or 4 of their albums under your belt."
5,The deconstruction of music.,"Sonic Youth don't make rock music, they rip it apart, set it on fire, and rearrange the pieces as they see fit. This record is dirty. This record is gritty. This record is urban decay in musical form. Was it recorded with the state of the art equpiment? Far from it, and all the better. With all the feedback, dissonance (sp?), pounding, screaming, and beautiful noise, the poor production quality becomes an instrument in itself, adding to the atmosphere of the album.Listen with an open mind, and you will quickly see your conceptions of music fall apart, and not one person I know has regretted this.Tracks to look out for:Freezer Burn, World Looks Red, Confusion is Next, Kill Yr Idols,and the allmighty Inhuman.Listen at volume: 10."
4,Sonic Youth at their rawest,"This album is absolutely full of classic, excellent songs that reflect an early period in the band's evolution. Personally I enjoy early Sonic Youth the most anyway, and the songs are all irresistable in that Sonic Youth kind of way. This is really only recommended for serious fans however, because the appeal is really limited musically. Not for top 40 types, not really for just casual fans of the band either(Daydream Nation should be enough). Serious fans and open-minded music fans will not be dissapointed."
1,I truly hate this record,"Confusion Is Sex/Kill Yr. Idols is by far Sonic Youth's most awful record, followed by the nearly-as-awful Badmoon Rising. This record is one big heap of moody, sometimes almost scary guitar-clanging and yelling, lacking any kind of structure. Ánd if there finally is a song that comes close to being interesting, it is ruined by the ridiculous sound-""quality"": it really sounds as if the band is rehearsing in a mouldy basement and someone has left his dictaphone there. The lyrics are the only good thing here, with it's wide variety of -often heavy- subjects, but the music ruins it all. I bought this when I was 16 and desperately in search of something different and experimental. God knows I was glad the day I sold this unlistenable junk and turned myself to their later records; because Sonic Youth is really not a bad band; they just used to be."
1,This is a truely awful record,"Here's a riddle for all those reading: if you knew how to write truely excellent and involving melodies, why would you sit around making noise? The answer: you wouldn't. Hence, the Sonic Youth and this album. Simply put, this record is a terrible waste. None of the songs have anything even vaguely resembling what I'd call a structure or riff. Instead, they rely on one vast dissonant wave of feedback after another while the band shouts and screams various nonsensical hipster lyrics like ""Sonic Tooth, Sonic Tooth"" as loudly as possible. Most of the ""songs"" go on for way too long, and overall the record sounds like it was recorded on a shaky handheld tape recorder. In other words: pure elitist garbage. It would be years before the youth would be able to put together a good coherent song without making all kinds of gratuitous ""experimental"" indulgences and their first album was no exception. Avoid it like the plague."
2,Not as pictured,"This product is ok if you are looking for something like a ""life vest"". I just wanted a simple vest for hunting with pockets and didn't realize this would be thick like a life jacket."
2,...Thrall rulz though,"Thrall rulz but, strangely, this album sucks and I can't explain why I feel that way...except for one song- track #2 Night Fell -I love that song!Their other two albums TOTALLY rule though -check them out instead!!!"
5,One of the Very Best!,"In a long-running, consistently good series, this one stands out as being even better. Poignant and beautifully written, this book has an ending you'll never forget. Any Fargo fans who haven't read this one yet should remedy that right away!"
5,THIS AMERICAN IS AMAZED!,"EVEN THOUGH I SPEAK FRENCH & UNDERSTAND 'MOST' OF THE LYRICS, CE STAR QUEBECOIS HAS AN INCREDIBLE VOICE! YOU CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE IT! eVEN IF YOU DON'T SPEAK FRENCH, THIS ALBUM IS WORHT BUYING JUST TO HEAR THAT VOICE! HIS LYRICS ARE AMAZING, ALSO. MY BUDDIES FROM THE NORTH ALWAYS COMPARE HIM TO A BACKSTREET BOY, BUT NO WAY....THIS GUY HAS SERIOUS TALENT!"
3,Almost as comfortable as my first 2 pairs but something's different,"I bought 2 pair two years ago in different shades of brown because I found them so extraordinarily comfortable and did not want to take the chance of wearing one out and not being able to find an exact replacement.With this same thought in mind I recently acquired a third pair. While almost as comfortable, the straps are slightly less comfortable the and shoe bed feels a bit smaller. I also acquired blisters on the center of the balls of both feet after only walking about a mile or so. This did not happen with my other 2 pair -- I can only surmise that this resulted from the slight change in sizing."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I purchased the sandals believing they were the same shoe I purchased several years but regretfully another company could not let an excellent product alone and changed it for the worse. The tread, the leather, and most importantly the sizing was very different from ""the original recipe."" They look and feel cheaper, I'm sure they do work for some people but I am not one of them. I ended up having to pay S&H for a product I don't own. Customer Service folks were very nice but didn't really help. The original sandal cannot be found in any warehouse stores. Teva does make many other great products but dropped the ball on this one."
2,They run small,"I have a pair of leather TEVA already. I love them and had worn them out. I would normally never order shoes on line, but I got what I thought was an exact replacement and they are really too small. I'd say at least a size smaller than my old ones. Be careful."
1,"Yes, they DO dig in and hurt!","The poster who complained about parts of the shoe digging in and hurting is correct. With me, it is the part where the T-strap hooks into the ankle strap that digs into my inner ankle quite painfully. Loosening the strap does not work. I cannot even stand having these shoes on my feet for very long, let alone do any kind of extended walking in them. I am sorry that I ever bought these overpriced and very uncomfortable sandals. I feel that I was completely misled by the looks of the shoe and the stellar reviews that I read. MAJOR disappointment."
5,"excellent, versatile sandals.","I just love my Teva Pretty Rugged Leather sandals in Black. I already have them in Brown and I can walk all day in them without a problem. They are great for street walking, beach walking, wading throught water and then with a little polish on them they are ready to wear out for a casual dinner. I only need one paid of sandals when I travel in Europe during summer and these fit the bill.Dianne HudsonAustralia"
4,Comfortable support,"I shopped around quite a bit before finally purchasing these Teva sandals and am not a bit disappointed. I have joint problems in hip and knee and also some osteo arthritis in my feet, so good support and fit are important to me. These sandals provide both. I especially like the bubbly type tread of the sandal. After walking on a hard surface for an hour or so in theTevas, I am still comfortable, but with another brand of sandals I feel sore after that period of time on the hard surface (sidewalk, etc). Also I like the soft lining under the straps so that the leather and plastic triangles don't cut into my skin. The sandals are easy to put on and adjust with the two velcro fastened straps. It seems that this summer these sandals are all I want to wear. They are styled to look good with skirts or with shorts. I found these sandals for less than at retail stores on Amazon.com. The shipping was prompt even though I have a hard-to-find half size. I would buy these again."
2,disappointed repeat customer,"This is my 4th pair of Teva Pretty Rugged leather sandals, and I am disappointed in the changes. Everything seems less rugged, and inferior -down to my toes being stained rust from the leather dye. It will be my last pair of ""Pretty Ruggeds"""
2,straps are too short!,"I bought this because I needed a bag that could carry all my things, plus my 6 year old's toys. The size is perfect, but the straps were way too short to carry on my shoulder comfortably. I am 5'7"" and average size. I guess my search for my perfect bag continues!"
1,Cash Grab,"This is wack. Stick with the original albums. If I wanted punk bands to re-record their hits I'd listen to TSOL and Agent Orange. Act like you know.Oh, and the original albums slay face."
2,Can you pay me now?,"As the monopolistic cell phone providers go, Cingular is heads and shoulders above the biggest bully in the sandlot - Verizon. I get - and keep - signals in rural areas where my friends' Verizon phones would be useful only as hockey pucks. But like all these ""service providers,"" Cingular charges for stuff you don't use. Also, the ""rollover"" is falsely advertised. They never show that you have any ""rollover"" minutes left at the end of the month. I use less than half the ""free"" 550 minutes each month on my 3-line account. But nowhere is this reflected as additional minutes available or as a credit. As far as the phone goes, it works well enough. But it doesn't have all the gee-whiz features that they hype it up as having. It would be a good package for about half the price they gouge you for."
3,"Gorgeous Artwork, Mixed Histories...","I received this deck as a gift, and it is full of beautiful artwork. The deck has a heavy Catholic and Christian influence as well. which threw me when I tried to use it. If that is appealing to you, then I highly recommend this deck, with a few points of note. THe cards are relatively large, almost too large for the average person's hand, and the cards are quite slick until they have been used quite a bit. I ultimately decided to purchase another deck, mostly because of the size, Catholic influence, and relatively pale colors. That is not to say this deck is a bad one, just not the deck I work best with."
2,Poor/confused symbolism makes this a difficult deck to read.,"I recently purchased this deck because one of my students was trying to learn Tarot with it. I opened it with great expectations, but found a dud of a deck inside. Some cards bear symbols not associated with their key, and others hold very little symbolism at all. The Emperor has very little to offer, and the High Priestess shows a bundle of WHEAT and flowers that belong on the Empress. This deck gives difficult, confusing readings as a result. I would not recommend it!"
5,"Can't wait to see what happens in book #5 ... soon, I hope!","I agree with the majority of the listed comments so I won't go on about it. I would like to mention that I have not read the books, I listened to them (all four so far) on unabridged recordings while I worked. It's so enjoyable to be able to visualize her tales while completing work which would normally keep me from enjoying a great work of fiction. If you can't find or afford the ""Books-on-tape"", try your local libraries. If they don't have it, they sometimes have an exchange program. Listen and enjoy!"
1,The Clan of the Cave Bear series,I read the first book many years ago. I searched for the rest of the series and devoured them over Christmas break. I am anxiously awaiting the final book. I am heartbroken to hear that Ms. Auel is suffering from cancer. My prayers and thoughts are with her. God Bless and Keep her.
5,"Great, Spellbounding and on fire!!!","when I first read the Clan of the Cave Bear I wasn't into reading much. The book was recommended to me by a friends mother. As I started to read I noted that it was hard for me to put the book down - a first. I had discovered that I did enjoy reading, but only certain topics. I have finished reading all 4 books in this series and have even read many more of similar topic. I eagerly await her continuation of the series!"
5,a most powerful and unforgettable read..one to pass on.,"I read the series many years ago and have never forgotten the experience..the author painted a very clear picture that I can still see in my minds eye. Ayla demonstrated such strength and courage and was discriminated against because she was different. As long as I live I will never forget the experience of the ""CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR"". The books that followed in the series were all outstanding but nothing can compare to the first one. When Ayla gave birth to her son She experienced a love that was never given to her and the story is simply amazing..Please DO NOT pass up this wonderful book/series."
3,Does not fit my bowl,"The lid is too large for my bowl. The description was ""fits all Kitchen Aid Stand mixers,"". When it arrived, the package said not for KSM models. This was not in the description and now I have to pay to ship it back. Not happy that it is not clear in the item description which models it does fit."
2,Not airtight fit!,"Received these items and disappointed as they are not airtight as someone else eluded to with their review. This will not work ""instead of saran wrap."" The bag they are packaged in clearly states only a loose cover to specifically allow dough to rise while getting oxygen...and yes, I verified my mixer is one of the models listed in the item description for fit. If they weren't this inexpensive, I would have returned them."
3,careful of size!,Make sure you really want the larger lids! I have the smaller bowl and was sad to find out once I opened the package that these are too large for my bowl.
2,Not my size either! How about offering all sizes?,"So, along with a few other reviewers, I too, now own two lids that don't fit as they are too big for my 4 & 1/2 quart size bowl. I do leave them laying on top of the bowl, however, when not in use because although it doesn't seal, it does cover the bowl and then some. If nothing else it keeps the dust and other flying objects my husband may send airborne when he's ""cooking,""Here's an idea, sell all the sizes, we can pick our bowl size and the manufacture can send us the right one. You have seen it on other items I'm sure where you click on one of the boxes, usually several lines under the price info, and then click ""Add to Cart."" Now that would be offering a customer service and they would probably sell the heck out of them because consumers would be assured that they were buying the correct item!"
2,"Good Idea, Poor Design","I had thought that these would snap on to the top of my mixer bowl, creating a tight seal, but instead they rest loosely on top. I have a standard sized Kitchen-Aid mixer, and the lid seems to rest on the inner circle around the perimeter of the lid. It serves the purpose I intended it for- rising bread dough- but it is not really what I wanted at all. If you have the larger mixer bowl, this will probably create a tight seal, but don't expect it to if you just have a standard bowl.Other than that, they are made of a high quality flexible plastic, and I am sure that they will last forever. Kitchen-Aid seems to have a pretty high standard for their products."
3,"To ""comlicated"" to use","I have the set of two. I have barely using them within a one year period, even though I am baking bread on a regular basis.I have cut one lid to hopefully use it as a splashing shield. The ones delieverd with the KitchenAid have to much open space. But cutting it into size did not really work well.Usually I am finishing my projects, so that I do not feel the need to store the mixing bowl with lid in my fridge.In the end a ""not needed purchase""."
5,Great Product,I have used the lid everyday to cover the mixing bowl just to keep dust out of there! Glad I bought it!
2,"One size feet all, not ideal !","The idea of one size feet all is nice! How ever it offers a sit on top lid that does not hold much, therefore not very efficient!"
2,No examination papers...,I think the product details are misleading... there are only two cds enclosed...no book or examination papers...
1,Misleading Material,"In the description it clearly states much more material than what is presented. 2 Cds. In fact, this set is ineffective without the questionaires. It is just audio cds presenting scenarios. What good is this book if you cannot challenge yourself against the questions. I am more than disappointed."
1,Wrong Choice,Please save your money and NOT buy this crap reviewer. It doesn't even deserve a single star. I wasted money from this. Buy the book WITH CD instead.
1,Great idea....horrible execution,My second clock recently died. They have a great idea but the quality of the product is horrible. I bought my first clock and it started making this loud ticking noise 3 months after the warranty expired. The company generously offered to sell me a refurbished unti for a little less than a new one. I got the refurb thinking that my first clock was a one off. The replacement clock failed even sooner than the first. This time it wouldn't chime. I opened up the unit and the quality of construction is poor at best. They have a great idea and I loved waking up to the chime but I have issues with paying a premium price for something some poorly executed.
2,No Repair Options,I bought a Zen clock about 3 years ago. I agree with some of the reviews that it is cheaply made -- however -- I liked the sound of waking up to the singing bowl. My striker on my clock appears to now be jammed -- so I cannot use it as an alarm clock. I contacted the clock company and they said they have no repair options but I could buy another one for half price. I can't bring myself to spend more money on this clock. I am very disappointed. Buyer beware.
2,"Great idea, poor execution....","I've been a meditator for many years now and I have always struggle to find a good timer that not only performed the function, but also had the pleasing sonic aesthetics that would not disturb my carefully cultivated mind states when signaling me.The Zen Clocks were that product. Not only pretty to look at, but pleasing to hear as well. It's a great idea, and the initial excitement of using the product would've made this review a 5 star if I had written it earlier.Unfortunately, they are overpriced and poor quality. I have owned two now, and both have stopped working, one within 8 months of purchase. If you are going to spend 100$ on a clock, you might consider how long you'd like them to last. If ""less than a year"" is good for you, then your set. All and all, I am disappointed.Granted, I use them quite heavily, and there are always bound to be bad ones in a batch, but two in a row is just sad."
2,Just not reliable,"MUST use duracell (only product that I've ever had that was this picky on battery brand) and it has a .99 cent clock inside it which naturally is unreliable... great concept poorly executed, I would rather have paid twice as much for a good set of guts, it's a cheap Chinese plastic 2"" clock mechanism inside. What a shame it's a nice chime to wake up to. Don't get this unless you can afford to be late whenever you want."
4,Nice way to start the day,"I purchased the millennium addition new at a 'discount' in 2001 and have woke to it every day since. No problems yet. Depending on what sleep cycle I am in, I may wake to the first chime or not until it is repeating every 4 seconds. It is wonderful not to be assaulted by a conventional alarm. Battery only model. Very simple to operate, 2 knobs to set the actual and alarm time. 1 slide switch to set the chime to on or off."
1,"Zen Clock from Now and Zen Boulder, Co,",I received a defective product and returned it to the company for replacement. They have had the product for two week and still have not done anything to replace the clock. After many call I ask for a refund of the purchase price and was told it would take a week to process my refund.The customer service at best is terrible. I checked with the BBB and found the have an F rating because they have failed to respond to the BBB requests to resolve other complaints.Buyer beware! If you have a problem do not expect to have their customer service respond in a timely manner. I would never buy from them again.
1,Very very cheap clock,"I just received this clock as a present, and it is a piece of garbage. It LOOKS nice, but the quality of the clock is poor. It's just glued-together wood. The clock itself is crap: the face is made out of paper, the hands are made of cheap plastic, and they used a pin to hold the hands to the knobs for setting the time. It stopped working almost immediately, for no reason."
2,Not well made,"I had this clock several years ago. It worked a little over a month, then didn't chime. I tried to take it back, but since the 30 day period was over, I was told to mail it to the manufacturer which was not cheap. Since I wasn't really very happy with the tinny chime, I didn't bother. The clock portion worked several more months, but then stopped as well. I'll never buy another although it did look nice."
2,Worked for awhile & then stopped,"I bought this clock 3 years ago & it was working very well, but now the LCD screen won't turn on. I'm very disappointed. There doesn't seem to be a way to fix it either. I should have bought a cheaper clock instead of this one."
2,Good and Bad - Sending it back,"I ordered the Zen Alarm clock direct from the manufacturer. I was hesitant because of the mixed reviews, quality issues, numerous reports of poor customer service and an F rating w/ the Better Business Bureau. But, I decided to take a chance because it seemed like the best made chime alarm clock out there. Well, it arrived today. They shipped it in its original box, not packed inside of a shipping box. The outside of the box was pretty beat up and it looks like it's an old box that's been re-used. Used or New? Can't tell, didn't even open it. Given the way they shipped it, there is no way I am keeping this. Sending it back to them tomorrow. Sad too, because I was thinking of buying a couple of them for gifts for special friends if the clock was as nice as I had hoped. Even though it is expensive, I was going to splurge if it was a really nice product. Sadly, the company lost not only my current sale but also potential future sales."
2,Great - When it Works,"I'm currently on my third Now & Zen clock in less than three years -- not one of them have lasted a year without breaking down. Luckily, I've been within my year's warranty each time, but the hassle is beyond frustrating. The most recent replacement clock they sent me is clearly used and has been refurbished. There's a nick in the wooden lid, it came with the batteries installed and battery cover loose, etc. It seems they're getting tired of replacing my clock...but not as tired as I am of dealing with them. Each time I get a new Now & Zen clock, I set it gently on my nightstand, and there it sits for about seven months, obediently ringing each morning, until the one morning it decides not to wake me for work. Battery replacement, turning it off and on, plugging it in, etc. -- nothing works. The darn things just seem to die of natural causes and there's no resuscitation possible...."
1,Could only have sold in a world before customer reviews,"We had our first Now & Zen digital alarm clock for less than a year when the LCD digits started failing. Now & Zen replaced it under warranty. Now, 18 months after that replacement unit no longer chimes. The best offer Now & Zen will make is to allow us to purchase a replacement for 50% off. You have got to be kidding me. N&Z, we paid $140 for what is likely $30 worth of parts. You know your stuff has quality problems. And the best you can do is to charge $70 for a replacement clock worth likely $30 in materials and labor? Sorry folks. Do you really care about the quality of your products? From the evidence this is a faulty item sold under the guise of consciousness aware products."
5,Never Gets Old,"I have listened to this CD over and over for the past eight years, and I never get sick of it. I have a very eclectic musical taste, from Bach to Led Zeppelin to Neil Young to Madonna (yeah you get the picture) and this is one of the few CD's that I keep coming back to again and again. There are so many amazing aspects to this album--the lyrics, the harmonies, the rhythms...I think what really does it for me though is Adam Duritz's voice. His voice is so strong and sad and sweet and emotionally charged. Listening to him is cathartic. I can't say how much I love this album. Buy it!"
5,AMAZING,"This is definately the best album of the 90's. Every song is great, especially anna begins for those of you who havent listened to it very much. Also the track 'august and everything after' is great, thats what the lyrics on the cover are for. If people dont like this album either they havent listened to it, or they dont know beautiful music when they hear it."
5,I LOVE THIS CD!,"This is the best of the Counting Crows. I especially love Sullivan Street and Rain King. My boyfriend and I put this in our car stereo and sing at the top of our lungs! Their lyrics are so relatable, and their music is beautiful. They are true artists!"
4,i am mr. jones,i am obsessed with this cd. mr. jones is my name. i like to eat cow liver. this cd was...
2,Quasi alternapop,"This album seemed a lot cooler when it came out than it really was. Fluffy balladry with an oddball vocalist that stands up for a few songs, but overall this is uninteresting self-indulgent tripe."
5,Great stuff!,"I bought this CD because I really liked ""Round Here"". But I got the surprise of my life since I loved all the songs ... most especially ""Sullivan Street"" and ""A Murder of One"". This is a great quencher for people who thirst for intelligent, contemporary music. The lyric beauty of the songs cannot be understated, this compilation deserves my utmost respect."
5,August and Everthing After Deluxe,Outstanding CD. The live show in Paris gives a little insight into what the way Counting Crows reinvents songs. Fans of Counting Crows love the alternate lyrics that they weave into familiar songs. As usual -- Counting Crows surpasses expectations.
5,Among my favorite albums of all time,"Every song on this album is great. I can listen to it from start to finish in one go. I particularly like ""Anna Begins"". If you like this album, you might also enjoy Matchbox 20Yourself or Someone Like You."
5,the one cd you should leave this earth with!!,"Top 5 best cds on earth, that's all there is to it. I've owned it since 94, and still listen to it everyday, yes, everyday, while in the shower. It has never left the cd player, unless it was time for a new cd player and I had to take it out to put it in the new one."
5,One of the best c.d.s ever,"This has to be one of the best C.D.'s ever. I usually listen to Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock, but this C.D. has to be the only one i can honetly say i love. so BUY IT"
5,will get steady play for years to come,what can I say... saw them live in the early ninties while living in SF. great songs & music live or on CD.
5,my favorite c.d,"This tape/cd is awesome. you dont have to skip through songs because there is none to skip through, they are all great except the very last one and even that one isnt all that bad. i would have to say round here, omaha, and mr.jones are the best ones. Even though it was made in 1993 it beats out any other album ive heard, and is a whole lot better than todays alleged rockers like limp bizkit and korn who just scream. counting crows are one of the best rock bands ever and you should definitly buy this one."
5,PERFECT!,"For everyone who likes to feel what they're listening to, August and Everything After is perfection. The kind of feelings of desperation, loneliness, love, acceptance, and fear that you, for some reason, enjoy feeling (Cafe moods). You will love it more each time you listen to it."
5,Easily one of the greatest pop recordings of all time,"This album is just about as close to perfect in ""pop music"" culture. Talk to almost anyone who has listened to this CD and they will all tell you the same thing, there is nothing quite like it. Counting Crows is a band known for their live performances. If you haven't seen a show yet and you are a fan, then make it a priority. Some bands that are great live [are bad] in the recording studio. The Counting Crows do not fit into that stereotype. Just do youreself a favor and buy this Cd if you don't already have it. I swear you will listen to it for years to come"
3,What's all the fuss about?,"It's funny to me how fans latch onto a particular band or artist and no matter what they come out with, it's ""awesome"". To me, this album is just average. It's sound is predictable, the songwriting is nothing special. And every track pretty much sounds the same.Go ahead and send the hate mail, I can handle it. But I picked up the album because it was recommended by Amazon customers. I love you all, and I have used your recommendations many times. This will remain in my collection, and maybe after time, it will grow on me, but not now."
5,A most honest and unpretentious look at human vulnerability,"If the mythical black-winged bird asks me to pick just one CD to the void, this would be it. No other compilation would match this album's imagery, poetry, humanity, depth and sincerity. Every time I hear the songs I felt like ... crying ... not just because of the bittersweet emotions evoked by the songs, but because of the inescapable truths so subtly enmeshed in the words. Read the book ""The Rain King"" and see what I mean."
5,soul warming,"This album warms my soul. I have heard every song the Counting Crows have published and this album, I think, is their best collection so far. I can't wait for their next creation."
5,awesome,"The original was good but the extra songs included as well as the live tracks really put it over the top. If you're a true Counting Crows fan, you don't want to miss this."
2,Nishiyama fails to deliver,"I bought this book as part of my MA dissertation work into the influence of langauge and accent in Japan. I was disappointed with what I found. Since this book was published relatively recently, I was hoping for a modern interpretation of Japanese culture--something that was missing from my literature review. Unfortunatley, I discovered Nishiyama failed to take into account modern-day Japan, but instead seems to reflect upon the Japan of 30 years ago. As a resident of Japan, I was interested in how Japanese business people would view some of Nishiyama's main points regarding Japanese culture, so I shared some of his observations of Japanese culture with students of mine during a business English class. They also tended to think that the protrait Nishiyama paints of Japan is outdated. If you're looking for a book that gives both an accurate and modern picture of Japan, then I would recommend you look elsewhere."
2,"If the price is too good to be true, it probably is!","Just got this and took it out of the bag and immediately noticed the horrible stitching, the cheap underlining, the shoddy batting used (thicker in some spots, virtually none in others), and the coarseness of the top fabric. For the price, this would only be good for decorating an unused spare bedroom or worse.If you plan on actively using this comforter on your bed, I highly recommend looking elsewhere."
2,Comforter set not a 'comforter' set,"The colors are much darker than the picture and the 'comforter' is not a comforter, it's more like a spread."
3,My son used these for a mild case ...,"My son used these for a mild case of eczema. They did seem to keep him from scratching, but we found that they didn't stay securely stuck in place long enough. Might use them again ... I'd definitely use them if the adhesive lasted a little longer."
5,How I Beat Cancer in Less Than 42 Days,This book is great. It is a must in every house where anyone suffers from cancer. I had cancer of the ovaries and got rid of it using the methods recommeded in this book. It is a must for anyone who is sick with cancer.
4,Must read,"When talking about technical advances, this book was outdated before it went to press. But Jim knew this when he wrote it. This is one of my favorite books on the topic of cruising and is a must read for all.I got my kitty started, now to find and refit a good boat.Thanks Jim"
2,Save your money,"This book starts with a couple of very good chapters, but then goes downhill fast. Mr Trfethen is an ad man who jumps from point to point giving the reader the ""sound bites"" of his profession and then quickly moving on with little solid information. He's stuck with double ended, full keel boats who days of glory are properly gone.There are lots of well written text out there on crusing, but this is not one of them."
2,Highly opinionated and not highly accurate...,"The book does have some good points if you can wade through the fluff. His obvious scorn for all ""plastic"" boats and the manufacturers that build them is quite obvious. He makes no bones about the fact if you buy anything other than a wooden boat for less than $50,000 you're a fool. I still would have given the book three stars until I got to his section on batteries. In two wiring diagrams he showed a direct short across the battery terminals that would cook the batteries if it didn't burn the boat up first! Fortunately he admits he is no electrical expert!"
4,Written for Americans,"This is a book written for Americans by an American. As a non-American some advice was irrelevant to me. Apart from this, I found it very useful; valuable insights as to what to expect from a cruising lifestyle, motivation to take the plunge and above all a humorous writing style. I found it compelling. Definitely a good book to read before you buy your yacht, and reread many times before you leave."
1,self indulgent &very opinionated,"This book is so full of waffle and technical innacuracies, dangerous ones at that, see the chapter on wiring a battery. You either agree with his attitude or yours doesn't count. You must do this, you must do that. My way is best, no other way counts runs all through this book. He is uncompromising and dictatorial and I'd hate to crew for him. I also wonder if his family life is as described in the book as it sounds so soap opera stereo typical, incidents pulled right from a tv show. It is not much help if you don't have money as he writes from a position of starting off with a healthy amount. All in all there are many more interesting and accurate and helpful books on this subject"
1,"Date, Opinionated, Lots of fluff, no real substance","The writer presents a great many generalizations, filled with opinions not backed up by any substance. A great deal of fluff but no real information is presented. Questionable guidance such as when rewiring the old boat you just bought remove your shore power connections because you're going to want to be like ""real cruisers"" anchoring out with them instead of docking at a marina. Financial advice is also along the same lines - save for 5 years, sell your house, you'll need about $3,000 - $5,000 per person per year - no mention of health insurance, etc. Fix up your boat as you go along - just shove off as soon as its sea worthy. The book is quite dated - with chapters on electronics amusing at best. Advice: Find a book that was written in the last year or so."
5,A Lot Of Fun,"Couldn't resist picking this up...The original vinyl spun many a spin on the old B&O turntable.Especially the 17:39 side long ""Tuesday Morning"" jam.So when this deluxe edition came out at triple the time of the original vinyl , I had to hear the working versions of what became the final version. Funny thing is , is the two aren't that dissimilar. Just a great , rockin' jam session. Everybody prepared their instruments , set the tape a-rollin' , and took off. Gotta admire the powers that be that released this. The market can't be all that huge for it. But if you looked up Paul Kossoff in the search , then you are probably already familiar with his huge talent , so put it in your basket now!"
1,Bad News Waste Of Money!!,"Are you people deaf? I've heard better sound quality on a dictating machine! If you really want to hear Dinah when she was at her best ""live"", get ""Dinah Jams"" from her Emarcy years and throw out this piece of trash."
5,Boyfriend Loved it,I gave this book to my boyfriend as a gift. He is a huge fan of the GSXR and still has his 1980...something bike. He opened the book and could barley put it down when it was time to go to bed.
3,Good Look,And interesting purview (from a Frenchman) of early America (Early 1800's) - In a novel form. Discusses much on women and slavery.
2,Yawn...When is this movie over?,"This DVD was def an impulse buy, I thought the premise of it taking place in the seventies was interesting, & the cover models/actors looked fine, but I honestly couldn't get through it without hitting the ""FF"" on the remote. Boring, contrived, not too well acted, and no attention to the era/genre detail make this a DVD I'll shelve for a long time before I let it resurface & be replayed."
3,Odd little flick,Interesting tour of the lives of these folks and the music which was their lives....and the drugs...and the sex.A weird trip to say the least.Lots of hot eye candy.
5,Awesome !`,"An awesome movie. Bryce acting is superb, he is very easy on the eyes, no, strike that, he is gorgeous and absolutely sexy.Dale is just perfect as a lead singer on drugs. Saw other movies of Everett Lewis, but this one is hands down his best, so far.I would recommend this movie to anyone, open minded, and who wants some eye candy sprinkled allover the screen...."
1,A more appropriate name for this book might be Dog Cruelty.,"This book employs some of the most primitive antics you can imagine. Can you imagine kneeing a dog in the chest if it tries to jump up in your lap. This author does. Most dogs would be psychologically scarred if you used these recommendations. Dog training should be accomplished with love and discipline, not fear. Don't waste you money on this book."
3,decent wrist rest,"The padding isn't all that soft, but I like that it is permanently mounted to the tray"
4,Watched FRONTLINE and then read the book,"The first part of this book was excellent and there are parts of the rest which I really liked. In places I found his style rambling and he sometimes ""wore a topic out"". All in all, it made me look at what an undertaker does in a new way!"
5,insightful,Gave me rare insight into the minds of people who deal with death - and all it's ramifications. I would recommend this book - well written - thoughtful. I bought it because I sell cremation urns through my store UrnConcern - and wanted to understand more about the 'industry' and how to help my customers.
1,Waste of time,"There are some funny and insightful parts to this book, but overall it is depressing and not worth my time to read it. Lynch never tells too much about himself or his family, but can tell you all about the locals. He goes on and on and on until he returns to his main themes, so you never quite get to know his true self. He is very senstive and caring toward the people he must deal with and it makes one wonder if all funeral directors are as compassionate. You can definately pick up in any chapter and not have missed a thing."
5,An ispired and thoughtful account of 'the dismal trade',"Thomas Lynch has produced an eloquent and thoughtful book of reflections on what he terms 'the dismal trade' of undertaking. This text is well-written ,insightfull and graced with touches of wry (though sometimes mordant) humour. While this might not be a 'beach book' it is easy to read; no doubt attributble to Lynch's skill with language garnered from his experience as a poet. I would highly recommend this slim tome.--Dr. M. A. Bailey"
4,No Secrets,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading a book that touches on the innermost fears all of us have about death and burial. In a setting in Michigan with which I am most familiar, having grown up nearby, I was taken back to times I had forgotten about, and thoughts of what lies ahead for all of us. A must read for those who need a good cry and a good laugh. I guarantee this book will evoke alot of memories!"
4,curiously appealing,"The writting was so lovely that the topic was almost irrelevant. For someone like myself raised in the Irish Catholic tradition, Mr. Lynch captured just the right hint of the macarbe that has been with us since childhood.More importantly, it gave me an understanding and even an appreciation of why wakes are sometimes very important and of the human need for ritual at a time of loss."
2,Well written but disappointing,"A very well written book that is also very disappointing. The books begins well and goes downhill from there, gradually becoming a 'yawner.' Gave my copy to a young mortuary arts student."
2,"I'm sure this is a good book for some, but not me.","I enjoy reading about the perspectives of mortuary science professionals. This book got way off topic on more than one occasion. Part of the reason the profession appeals to me is their unique perspective on death, so this really seemed like a bullseye for me. But I was left feeling very disappointed."
2,The Undertaking: Life Studies from a Dismal Trade,I was friends with a mortician in a small town and listened to some appropriate stories. He could have written a better book.
5,A masterful survey of a master photographer,"""I think William Eggleston invented color photography,"" said John Szarkowski, the authoritative curator of photography at New York's Museum of Modern Art, around the time of the wildly influential show in 1976 that MoMA staged of this ground-breaking artist.Now, twenty years later, Eggleston has won the Hasselblad Award and this resultant book is a handsome and solid survey of the photography that changed how photographers looked at the world."
5,A Magnificent Journey,"Looking through this book is a magnificent journey through the beauty of California's magnificent Central Coast. Photographer Douglas Steakley has captured this beauty in an amazing way. I would strongly encourage locals, visitors, and those unable to visit this area to buy this book. This is not an ordinary photo book that you flip through in a few minutes! Although I am fortunate enough to live in this wonderful area I spent quite a bit of time looking at each page absorbing the fantastic photography Mr. Steakley has to offer. The poetry by Ric Masten and foreword by Jane Smiley were also delightful to read and are an important part of this beautiful book."
1,Rip off,I am so disappointed that I already bought the turbo twist math for my 6 year old. I Think that he would really love to play with it but I can't believe that when I went to order the spelling one I saw the mind station and read about it. How unfair it is to charge a monthly fee for an already expensive toy. Kids need to learn exactly these things but I can't afford to pay a monthly service. So I guess I will be returning the turbo twist math. Bummer!!!!!!!!
1,YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW THIS,"This product is educational and everything, but just at what it says under features...""Requires additional fee for this service"".I suggest you pay attention to this because you probably weren't suspecting that..."
3,mind station with Turbo Twist- Spelling,The mind station was very easy to use with the Turbo Twist -Spelling. Each week I logged on to the computer site and typed in my grandson's spelling words. These were downloaded into the cartridge and once placed into theTurbo Twist he had his own spelling tutor that said his words out loud to him and provided him with an opportunity to spell each word and told him if he was correct.
5,I never thought I'd hear that!,I never thought I'd hear my 6th grader say he likes spelling. This morning after studying his spelling list from the Turbo Twist Spelling he said he never thought he'd being saying it until now. We have had it for only a few weeks and it has made a tremendous difference in his attitude toward his spelling. This product works just as I would like it to. The only problem is I have not been able to find any other Mindstation cartridges. We also have a LeapPad that I would like to download things for. This is definitely worth the money.
1,Not Supported by LeapFrog,This product is no longer supported by the company. Which means there are no downloads available anymore...I don't know why it's still for sale.
2,Mixed feelings about this gadget.,"The Mind Station is helpful if you use all of the other toys. I liked it because I could put my children's weekly spelling list on it for the Turbo Spelling for them to practice each week. One of the downsides is that I had to buy an additional memory cartridge for my second child. Another disadvantage is that you have to buy a subscription in order to keep using it after the initial free 6 month period after purchase. So, I haven't seen my kids really using it that much since the inital month or two after it was first given to them. We have the Turbo Spelling and the Leap Pad, but only use the Mind Station with the Turbo Spelling."
4,Very Pleased,"My five and six year old children love the LeapPad and Turbo Twist Spelling. It does take a little while to download the information onto the cartridge, but it's worth it to me. Both of my children have learned a lot from these products and the Spelling ""toy"" has helped my first grader with his weekly tests. I have not been able to find extra cartridges in the stores yet... I definitely recommend these items if you don't mind spending the money. :o)"
5,parts not included and info not given!,i bought this thing and had to return it! we found out online it is supposed to come in both usb and serial bus! but it is only stocked in serial port version! our computer is less than a year old and does not have one. and the company says they cannot get one that will work for us! there is only one cartridge in it. and i paid an extra [money] for more to find out i can't use it! and it comes with no ac adapter you have to buy that yourself! i was very dissapointed! the company has no idea when they will make more universal that can work on any computer! And the company is alot less than helpful! the tech tried to get rid of me because i was asking question! so i honestly hope you don't ever have to call the company!
1,Mindstation is a let down!,"I have 3 kids of different ages who use the mindstation. There was only one cartridge with the unit they received for Christmas and I've searched the stores but cannot find other cartridges. In order for one child to use the cartridge, I have to erase information on there for another child. The other complaint is that the pages it prints out don't stay in place on the Leap Pad. Therefore, you touch the pen to the word or picture and it will tell you the wrong thing. You have to hold the paper perfectly still....one slip and you lose it! It's totally aggravating and had we not received it as a gift I would never had bought one."
2,You have to pay a yearly subscription fee,"To enter in your child's own weekly spelling lists on the Leapfrog Turbo Twist Spell you have to have a Mind Station and pay for a subscription to Leapfrog's online service. Phooey on that! Also, it's would be nice to know that you have to pay a subscription fee for each toy. I'm sending mine back."
1,It's out of date and unusable!,"I purchased the Mind Station about 12 months ago. The connector did not fit the new computer, so I bought a $20+ attachment with the advice of Leapster tech support. Now I'm hooked to the computer and trying to connect to Leapster web site, but they no longer service the Mind Station! They wont even answer my tech support questions. DON'T BUY MIND STATION AT ANY PRICE!"
4,Mind Station Will work on a Macintosh,Mac user may still be able to load data with a mind station. You will need to use Virtual PC. A serial port Mac will only need a cheap Palm PDA adapter cable. A USB port Mac will need a USB to serial port adapter like the one from Keyspan. I used the above today to make a turbo twist vocabulator 2 Mb data cartridge.A BELKIN USB to serial port adapter might also work or a Socket Comm PCMCIA (PC card) to serial adapter if you have a PowerBook laptop computer.-------------------What I used:MAC OS 9.2.2VPC 5.1 (WINDOWS-98)Keyspan dual serial port adapter (USB to Mac serial)PALM to MAC cable adapter (Mac round din to PC DB-9)------------
4,"A ""toy"" my kid uses!","My sixth grade son is actually using his I-quest! It took me a little while to figure out how to set up the Mindstation. You have to properly enable your serial ports. Then, the Leap-Frog on-line directions are very clear. The questions he could download were very helpful in studying."
1,Great Idea on paper....,"The entire line of Mindstation products left my entire family disappointed. The Leap Pad works find but downloading and printing new content is at best a challenge and the monthly magazine that requires audio content downloads is full of glitches. In addition to the Leap Pad we have four of the twist units (Math, Spelling, Vocabulary and Fact Blaster) and all of the promises of progress reports and new content are completely misinformed. The customer service was terrible, I would get a different solution (that didn't work) to the same problem from each person I spoke with unless they tried to convince me that it was my computer's problem which happened frequently. If I thought it wouldn't be a complete waste of time I would pack up all of the items and send them back to LeapFrog. I doubt they would even take notice. At least I have a child young enough to still get some use out of these things before his knowledge passes them."
4,Personalize your Leap Frog toys.,"The Mind Station is the ""go-between"" from your computer to your leap frog toys. I add my son's weekly spelling test on the computer (internet access a must) and download it from the computer to a 2MB cartridge (sold separtely) to put in the Turbo Twist spelling game. He got a B instead of a D on this week's spelling test! He studied the words because it was a game. When we get the iquest & the 4MB cartridge, I'll be able to download his history and science test questions."
4,"Nice toy, but need more to really get value","I got this for my daughter for Christmas and have just figured out I need the Mindstation to use the different books. After reading the reviews I'm unsure if I should get it or not, apparently the extra cartridges are hard to find. I worry that I do all this and the thing might break.She seems to love it. I wish it came with more colors, but we all have those anyway. She has carried it with her and seems entertained playing with it. The train template is not that entertaining for her, but she is four. Maybe that template is meant for younger kids. I'm going to wait to get the Mindstation and see if she really wants it."
1,"Nothing but headaches from this ""toy""","First, even though the instructions show both serial and USB connections, there was only serial on our model making a [$$$]adapter necessary for us to use with our one-month old computer.Second, each time I attempt to download a new activity from the leapfrog website, the cartridge will successfully erase (step 1) but never manages to finish downloading the activity. On both computers in our home, we get errors telling us that the transfer was interrupted, check the cable connection from the Mind Station to the computer and make sure the cartridge is inserted fully into the Mind Station...both are OK.The Leapfrog help site states that this is caused by insufficient battery power but these batteries are BRAND NEW! I'm sending this gift back even though I had HIGH HOPES that it would improve my daughter Leaptop toyl"
1,Disappointing,"My child,... was recently given an imagination desk for his 3rd birthday. I thought it would be nice to be able to download new activities from home, so I bought him the mind station. I was, however, disappointed when I discovered that the choices of new activities include a total sum of two coloring books - both of which were too basic for him. If my kid can already count to a hundred, he does not need a toy that teaches him to count to three. Do not buy this toy for the imagination desk unless your child is starting from the very beginning."
1,What a disappointment!,"As I had heard there was a compatibility issue with this product and only those items manufactured after August 2002 would be USB compatible, I called ahead to customer service to ensure this item was USB compatible. I was assured by customer service that this was the latest version and, therefore, decided to purchase. This is not the USB compatible version of the product. What a disappointment! It has since been returned and will have to purchase at a brick and mortar store so I can actually read the packaging. Ughhh!!!"
1,Poor design,"While I think the idea is great, the execution is terrible. The Mind Station only comes with a serial port connection (old technology) and not a USB port connection (standard technology) and since my serial port connection is already occupied I was unable to connect the Mind Station to the computer. Note, I was able to find a serial to USB adapter (as suggested by the people at Leapfrog), but the adapter costs more than the product."
2,No longer supported,Leapfrog informed me today when I went to their website to upload new spelling words for my daughter that they no longer support this product - so my turbotwist is also worthless. I spent $60 on this and the turbotwist and the 2 mb cartridge about a year ago only to find out it is no longer supported. WASTE of MONEY.

2,This is not the 4 Tops you Remember!!!!,"I purchased this CD not too long ago (in the last month), and was very disappointed! I have a collection of moldy oldies and the only song missing from my collection is a song done by the 4 Tops - ""Are You Man Enough"". So I had ordered this CD and was very disappointed, the songs must be from studio outtakes and the 4 Tops sound is not what any of my generation has listened to. Do Not Buy this CD - It is not what is represented!!"
1,four tops,"I ordered this NEW!!! It came with a note inside saying Disc 1 cracked. I am NOT happy. What can I do NOW? Its been paid for.50th Anniversary Anthology (Dig)Unless this is resolved, I will strongly consider never buying from you again!!!"
3,old sutff,mostly the old stuff and therefore a bit outmoded. recoomend the 'essentials album' instead !
3,1st cd was great,The 1st cd was great to listen to. Brought back memories. The 2nd cd had songs on it that I never heard and was probably a waste. Would not recommend purchasing.
2,Four Tops,The music played low..... The tone was off a bit. I opened it and would like to return this product for another.
5,cd,"Great CD, brings back memories and missed their great songs, My favorite on the cd is Just ask the lonely"
3,PCI compatible?,"OK, I have a Texas Instruments PCMCIA (PCI) port that is supposed to be compatible with Type I, II, and III PCI cards. This card fit OK in my laptop's PCI slot, but not the TI, and it's because of the row of raised dots on the card. I have a PCI disk drive that fits into both slots, and the only difference between the two cards is that row of dots. Otherwise, I suppose this is a fine product, but I don't get the compatilbilty issue."
4,Sounds Great,"We now get the full surround sound effect. It is complicated to set up and we are still figuring it out, but we do get better sound effects than we were getting with our older Yamaha receiver"
2,Looks only,The information on this product was sparse and when I received it I discovered it was not a bulb that produces light that plants need. Rather it filters out blue light and doing so makes the plant look good. Disappointed.
2,NOT A GROW LIGHT,This was pretty falsely advertised This light merely adds a nice atmosphere but does not really help the plant to grow.
1,NOT a true GROW light!,"The first one blew out in 2 minutes. I returned it and got a replacement and it has burned out. It is a snowy day and my seedlings need light. Now I look at the package and read, and research and find out this is called a plant light and sold next to seed starting products BUT it is not a GROW light. Even the package says: it makes plant look greener with its blue tint. GREAT. I want healty growing plants not articificical green appearance for 14.99 plus tax. Save your money and get something that says: provides FULL SPECTRUM OF DAYLIGHT if you are trying to grow anything."
3,ge 20996 65 watt r 30 plant light,"they work very well and all are still working after several months,wife used them to help start her veg plants and then moved them to her in door trees,"
2,Mash Up Mayhem,"Well it looks like MOS have found another excuse to dredge up some vintage tunes and cash in on them. Some of these are absolutely hideous! In terms of Mash up style, there is something seriously lacking about any compilation that mixes Drop the pressure under two different track and calls them separate tunes. There are some decent tracks on this but frankly if id bought it i would have taken it back and complained."
5,Super Set!,"If you want to encapsulate the recent dynasty, this set is for you and non fans alike. Fun, entertaining, informative and thoughtful. Go, enjoy the dynasty again with the New York Yankees!!"
3,Where's the Clinching games,"I'm happy about the 96 WS 6m5 & 01 yankee stadium gm's but they should have 96, 98, 99, 00 Clinching games, because those are the games really matter."
5,EXCELLENT,This is another typical exemple of French literature. The breath-taking story is framed by the perfect language. This is excellent reading.
5,The red and the black,"as if though led by destiny, I started to read this book accidentally but then found myself with tears at the end of this book. Julien Sorel... the ultimate character ever produced by literature, is a young amibitous man with a middle class background, and later on in the book he becomes more and more complex. This book draws much emotion to the reader, it is very, very touching and thoughtful. Stendhal shows so much emotion here it is almost given that he had felt love in this way too, and it is true, he had pursued love blindly in his lifetime. You'll find this book a great one with lots of strong feelings to it."
3,"great colaboration, not as great music","With Jeff Beck, Slash, Gilby CLarke, Lenny Kravitz, Sebastian Bach, Snake plus others, you'd find it hard to believe that this is a bad album, which it really isn't. It's not gn'r, of course, but it's deffinitly good. Its in my normal rotation of cd's i would listen to."
3,believe in this album,"After avoiding this album for twelve odd years due to the negative things I had heard about it, curiosity got the better of me and I chased up a used copy. What a surprise! There is some really good stuff on here, 10 Years and Lonely Tonite are forgotten gems. Duff tries his hand at styles as diverse as rock, rap, punk and slows it down on a couple of tracks to mellow in the vain of So Fine, his major contibution to the Illusion set. Sometimes it doesn't work, most times it does. In fact, some of these tracks would not have been out of place on the Illusion albums, and could have taken the place of some of the filler including: Get in the Ring, the unnecessary second version of Don't Cry, and the two covers: Live and Let Die(Wings), and the awful Knocking on Heaven's Door(Dylan)."
3,"Decent, but I expected more","Undoubtedly most people know Duff Mckagan from playing bass in Guns 'n Roses. However, during GNR's downtime Duff decided to release a solo record for Geffen Records. While the record isn't terrible, I wouldn't put it in the essential catorgory either.The main issue I have with this album is, that it's all over the musical spectrum. One time you have punk rock, the next you have an all-out metal song, then just to mix it up Duff puts in a rap song. I guess that works for some guys, but not Duff freaking Mckagan! Another issue is the song writing, some songs aren't written too bad, however some sound pretty awful. All the bad stuff aside, there are some pretty decent songs on here as well. I really liked ""Believe In Me"", ""Trouble"" and ""The Majority"".I guess if your're a GNR' completist you'll wanna have this disc as well. For other fans of the genre, just tone down your expectations or you'll be disappointed."
2,A disappointing album,"Recognizing that fans need to allow musicians to grow and evolve with the times, ""Back into Blue"" is a suprisingly poor follow-up to Quarterflash's first two albums. ""Quarterflash"" and ""Take Another Picture"" exude both emotion and musical honesty through a jazzy/soft-rock medium. The band apparently left their instruments at home when they recorded ""Back into Blue"". The album is filled with poppish studio synthesizer which strikes this listener as both shallow and hollow. The musianship evident on the first two albums is hidden by the sequencers of the third. I would advise all but the Quarterflash fanatical to invest their entertainment dollars elsewhere."
3,A disapointment from the previous edition,"This edition is considerably watered down from the previous edition. Dialogues are much shorter and less realistic, grammar points are glossed over, and substance seems to have been replaced by nice graphics."
3,Disappointed--not as good as the previous edition,"I was disappointed with this new version. I taught myself conversatonal German for three months, using the previous version ""Teach Yourself German: A Complete Course for Beginners"" also by Paul Coggle, which I thoroughly enjoyed. This version's conversation examples are shorter and tentative. I completed the previous version, but short-lived with this version because I found this version not as good or as fun as the previous version."
4,sprechen Sie Deutsches?,"The book is helpful. I have learned things, and the order in which the lessons are presented works nicely. Nevertheless, the book lacks some more depth. For instance, there is not a strong section on phonetics or on structuring sentences.Overall, the book does the job."
3,not bad,"Ok, I bought this thinking I could simply listen to the CD in the car and bring back/learn some of the basic German I learned many years ago in high school. Not true. This CD/book combo needs to be studied together - primarily by studying the book first and then by listening to the CD to support the things learned in the book. The CD doesn't actually ""teach"" it just goes over the things taught in the book. If I had more time to read the book then it would probably be a great buy."
3,a good last minute cramp language guide before launching yourself into a world of mostly german language only location.,"bought this as an attempt to feel less like a lost donkey in germany. would like something with more games as assessment due to my short attention span. only managed to cramped 10 chapters in a week, before i totally lost the drive and interest.overall i think it is fairly good as a stepping stone to learning the language."
2,dissapointed,"i picked this book up in preparation for my stay in germany with a friend, whose mother does not speak english. maybe it was because i have some prior knowledge of basic german, but the first several chapters of this book were almost useless. when i showed my german friend the book and cds, he said 'no one talks like this. if you speak like this people will just laugh at you'. i decided to purchase this from my experience with teach yourself norwegian and swedish, which so far has been very pleasant and helpful."
2,Poor Quality,The quality of the print was so poor that it appeared blurry. The paper was also poor quality. I do not recommend the book based on the physical appearance.
5,Being Camus for a second,"Camus shows through this book why he is a great writer, one could only wish to look at life through Camus' eyes and mind, even if it was for a second. Fortunately this book allows us that pleasure. Camus shows us a man who is patient when confronting his destiny. One of Camus' best."
5,"Unfinished Means Unfinished, Right?","It then mystifies me how some people here have chosen to review this Unfinished Work -- Poorly Edited, Redundant in Parts, etc -- exposing how silly and superficial their criticisms are of this Unfinished Work. I have yet to read this book, but plan to add it to my library very soon. And, my expectations differ from those of most I have seen expressed here -- with the exception of a few individuals, who have the maturity to accept it for what it is -- an Unfinished Work."
3,Camus takes one giant leap backwards.,Camus leads us directly where his cliche geomental abstractions have taken us before. Its time for Camus to discharge this obsession with estivation and learn to love the summer solstice. Hibernation is not all that anyway.
1,Albert Camus' The First Man - we have no right to read this,"I was going to read this book. I bought it for a graduate class I'm taking in the English department at the university where I am attaining my Master's. Then I looked into the history a bit and decided that to read this book would be to engage in ideological rape. Albert Camus did not give his CONSENT to publish this book in this version. Period. Posthumous publishing of a dead author's UNCOMPLETED work or works is immoral and unethical. I don't need to quench my voyeuristic thirst by reading something the author never intended me to read. Some might argue otherwise, but I just don't see how peeking at your sibling's diary is EVER justified. It is someone else's private property, we don't have a right to read it without their permission.Sincerely,Sean Hooks"
4,"An important, thrilling grounding in Camus and our values.","If you like Camus, Algeria, existentialism, the Mediterranean, history, the Sahel, motherhood or any of the above--or even Proust--you'll be moved by THE FIRST MAN. So many questions about the origins of Arab-Western conflict, about life in North Africa, or about why we and Camus came to our world view, are richly answered here. Camus' earlier works set in Algeria, such as THE PLAGUE and THE STRANGER, are enhanced by this fragmentary revelation of his childhood reverence for ""the sweet security of poverty,"" of simple sensual pleasures, of serving without question, and of groping, always restlessly, for one's own values"
5,This book is a masterpiece!,I read this book from beginning to end in a few days. The language is exquisitely conversational and full of dark nuances and mystery. I'd recommend this book (along with The Plague) to anyone interested in understanding why Camus won the Nobel Prize for literature.
1,Everything in Spanish!,"I thought this would be perfect for my grand-daughter's 8th birthday since she is very interested in places of the world. I was so disappointed that the graphics are all in Spanish(Oceano Atlantico, etc.) Nowhere in the product discription was this stated. I was under the impression that she would have the option of English or Spanish for the spoken words, which would have been fine, but she, nor I, read Spanish. Now I am told that I must pay to return this product, which is of no use to my grand-daughter."
4,Globe Hopping,"Although this was rated for 8 and up, I purchased this globe for my 4-year-old granddaughter. Her mommy recently began travelling globally for work and it really helps her to be able to see where Mommy is that day. She has traveled some herself so we use the distance to find out how long it will take Mommy to get home. She also likes learning about the music. She already can identify several countries and states on her own. We adults in the family have played the games and find them very educational. [...]."
1,Fun but broke after a few months,"Defintely a great concept but the touch pen quit working after about half a year. Now its just a plain globe. Ratings are based on function level after it quit working, since I found many similar sotries on the web. Sad the quality is so LOW. It would be all 5s otherwise"
5,Love It,"We bought this for my daughter, but my husband and I fight over who can play with it! It's a great way to learn geography!"
5,leapfrog smart globe,"This is my second leapfrog globe, the first for my grandson, and this one for me. I like to keep a globe about, and figured I could use the extra info, the elevations and populations and etc. It's fun."
3,Good Learning Expierience,The Explorer Globe is a great learning expierience for kids and adults. It includes games were you have to find a contry or state. There is also music from different country's and oceans that you and your family can listen to. this is a great product and is worth $108 plus tax.
5,Great!,"I love it! You can touch every country. My dad loves it too. We like to play Eureka in the evnings. Eureka is where the globe tells you a country and you have to find it. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't tell the government the countries. I got it for Christmas, and haven't had any trouble with it breaking or anything. If it gets left on, it turns itsself off. Ricky, age 9 1/2"
3,Did not hold attention like I thought,"I have a 6 year old who loves to learn, who is a great reader, and who can sit still for hours, but I have to say this didn't hold his attention like I hoped. He had even asked for a globe, and we have so many great leapfrog products I figured this would be a hit. My take is that if it had some kind of screen like a video game attached to it, he would have loved it, but that is hindsight. Still, I think it is pretty awesome, and hope that over time so will my son."
3,Nice toy but way overpriced!,I can't rate how long it will last as it was recently purchased. Also received in white not as pictured in blue. I paid full price of $[...]. which I find way overpriced for what it is. I must say I was very dissapointed in the item for the price. The kids enjoyed it and I hope they will be able to use it for many years.
2,"great concept, poor quality and execution","We bought this brand new for our 4 year old, who is fascinated with maps. It's great for continents, larger countries and states. . .but just try to pinpoint Rhode Island with that pen and you will be told "" Two states have been chosen. If you want Rhode Island, choose the red arrow, if you want Connecticut, choose the blue arrow"" or some similar message. Well, to a child trying to learn the names of the states and countries, that is not terribly helpful - if he knew what he wanted, he wouldn't be asking the state's name to begin with. Oh, and good luck in Eastern Europe!If I were the only one with such problems, I would return it for another and give it another try, but since this there are so many problems. . .I think I'll return it before my 90 days is up in favor of something more reliable."
5,What a great product!,I love this globe! My father and I have contests and can't put it down. He got it as a gift for my daughter so three generations enjoy it. So much information packed into one toy. Thanks!
5,learn something new,"What a up date from the globe they had when I was a kid. I bought this globe at christmas time for my eight year old who just finish studing continents. My husband and I had this globe on our list to buy a year sooner, the price make us wait and I wished I had bought it sooner. It is a great globe! We all have learned a lot of facts and it's been fun to play as a family (you can play 4 players at a time)I am sure going to get a lot of good use out of this with three boys."
3,fun and educational for adults too!,My kids love learning with this globe but I have to agree with the comment about the pen. Ours continues to malfunction even with new batterys. For some reason the pen will pick up points of the globe that werent even touched. Its a little frustrating but when it works its terrific.
5,wonderful educational toy,"this is educational even for adults!! my 5 year old and 7 year old play with it for hours, they can quickly identify states and countries on other maps. this is well worth the money!!"
1,Poor quality for the price,"My 8 year old son received this as a gift last year for Christmas. By February (if that) the pen no longer interacted with the globe, and yes, we tried replacing the batteries. Every Leap Frog product we have bought for our kids has mal-functioned and I think for the prices you pay, they should last a lot longer than they do."
5,We ALL enjoy this toy!,"My daughter recieved this toy last Febuary for her birthday. She had the flu at the time, and we all took turns ""beating"" each other finding the countries. (Her grandparents played the most!) We first purchased one in the store, and then returned it and ordered from the website, as it was the last one on the shelf after Christmas, and ahd a short in it- I'm sure it had been played with a lot!! It is actually a little over my six year old's head, and would probably be best suited for a 8 yr. old for the price, but she has played with it some since the first month. She doesn't think about it herself, but if I suggest it, she will play it for about an hour at a time. My 3 year old is too rough with the wand to play with it un-monitored"
4,Educational Toys,"I brought this for my 4 year old grandson, I think his Mother & Father are having a lot of fun with it. My daughter thinks it is a great as she is teaching him all about her home, "" Australia."""
5,LeapFrog Globe,"I believe this item is a great educational tool for children. Not only does it help them learn the globe, but it also makes it fun to learn by having various interactive games for them to play."
3,It's a great thought...,"I bought this globe for my son this past Christmas. My son is Autistic and is VERY facinated with anything that has to do with geography. We bought him a regular globe and he loved it so much I thought this one would be perfect. The pen is very tempormental. sometimes when playing the game it doesn't recagnize the correct answer when touching it. Also sometimes it just either dosesn't recognize the pen touching anything or goes haywire. I am also dissapointed that the batteries don't last very long. We put new batteries in it Christmas Eve and come mid Christmas afternoon it said to replace the batteries. I love the concept and my sone likes it, but since it's so hard to use and doesn't hold power too long, I wouldn't buy it. It is now on the Top shelf of his closet and he is back to the old plain globe we bought at the office store for 10 bucks!"
1,Didn't Work,I bought this for my daughter when we home schooled. We loved it but after a couple of months of use the pen stopped working. You point the pen at the country/state etc. and the computer tells you facts about that area. So its critical to have the pen working! We looked the item up online and they said to mail the pen into them and we did so without ever hearing back from them. It has been months now. I read someone else's review with a different problem and they mailed the item back and haven't heard from the company. That is VERY disappointing as this item is fairly pricey and once it doesn't work its just a regular globe. Good luck!
2,Educationally great. Quality not so great,"We bought this globe two years ago for my daughter and she loved it! We too enjoyed learning about the countries, capitals and all the other wonderful information it provides. After GENTLY using this product for two years, I have had to replace the pen twice at $5 each including the hassle of getting one and then out of the blue, every country is being incorrectly identified. Sensors have shifted like other users have reported, HOWEVER, because the globe is more than 90 days old, the company now will offer only a replacement globe at half price ($50) plus shipping and handling ($5) AND I have to ship the old one back at my own expense. All of that translates this globe into close to $200, a lot of time and trouble, a disappointed child, and in my opinion poor product quality and service. Buyer beware."
3,"Great toy, but not worth $245!!!","This is a great toy, but I cannot believe they are trying to sell it for $245!!! It would have to do a lot more than it does and give you a lot more information about each continent, country, etc for it to be worth even half that much! I say it is worth about $50, maybe up to $75 at the most!! The main value of it is in helping kids and adults be able to quickly identify and know off the top of their heads where countries and capitals are. I like it, but would not recommend it at the price they are selling it for."
2,LeapFrog Explorer Needs Help!,"This toy is poorly constructed. A flimsy tape, approximately 1/4"" in width completely encircles and connects both halves of the globe. The tape wasn't even properly inserted. In fact the first one we received was damaged and had to be returned. We spent the better part of Christmas eve repairing the replacement globe, and quite frankly we did a better job than the manufacturer. I wouldn't buy this toy again."
1,Sad - We owned 4 of them,The 4 new globes came defective and all needed replacement batteries. One globe worked for almost 30 days... when we went to return it to Amazon we were charged a 20% restocking fee. These globes are very good if they work! Leap Frog has stopped making them and I wonder why?I would look at the Oregon Scientific model even for a child... This globe is a waist of $ based on quality.
1,VERY disappointed in the quality!,"I would not recommend this product to anyone. My 7 year old daughter just received this globe for Christmas, and was very excited, said it was her favorite gift. Unfortunately, after playing with it for only a day, the tip of the stylus/pen is breaking off, and thus it no longer is interacting correctly with the globe. She was not rough with the pen, used it appropriately, and is now very disappointed that the globe is not working, and that we will be returning it for a refund. I had read many reviews before buying that said the stylus often broke early on, so shame on me for not listening. I expected more from a Leap Frog product, and will avoid buying their products in the future."
2,Problem Stylus?!!,"Got it as a birthday gift for our daughter - great product to teach kids about ""the world around"" and she adores it.The product lacks precision and accuracy. At the beginning the problems started with identification of smaller state/country and later ended up in total chaos. Manufacturer suggested replacing the stylus (FYI - Leap Frog identifies this as a generic complaint and will replace 2 styluses free of cost), but the problem continues to exist. Leap Frog once again suggesting the stylus replacement!?Just wondering if I could get a total replacement and the product remain worry free for a while!"
2,Never got to try it,"the globe, which was purchased due to reviews, arrived in-half I believe due to poor packaging. because of the price and this was a christmas present, we decided to return the product and purchased another globe of similar type locally."
5,well worth the money,i can say this toy is worth all the money in the world there is so much you can do this item will be countless hours of fun .
1,not a durable toy even after 5 MINUTES,"My daughter just got this as a gift for her 5th b.day. As soon as we opened the box from amazon, the globe was broke in half. I exchanged it at Toys R Us and we just got it home and it's not working properly. In the middle of the game it starts the game all over and within 5 minutes of using it, it no longer accepts touch with the stylus.I am not sure if we should bother another exchange or not. It took 4 exchanges of leapster before my child got one that worked longer than 3 months. Very disappointing."
1,Cheap!!,The cost of this toy is very cheap but you can tell when you get it! It was the worst toy and the cheapest toy my child has gotten and I can tell why it was only the price it doesn't work well at all!
3,Pen problems,"We also noticed pen problems. It works about 2/3 of the time. It's quite annoying. Otherwise the toy is great fun for a child, and LOTS of fun for an adult as well."
4,Out of my expectation,Pretty cool globe and contains multiple functions. My 1.5 year old daughter loves to play it with the music from all the countries.
5,Great Educational Value,"I love this Leapfrog explorer Globe. The price has really come down over the years, so I finally caved in and bought one. My friends and I (all around 25 years old) have actually had competitions that really help us to learn a great deal about the earths geography. It's a little embarrassing how little we know about the locations of countries, but this globe makes the learning fun and VERY quick!"
4,"Not quite shoegazer, not quite pop","Blind is a fine follow-up to the debut ""Reading Writing & Arithmetic"" but doesn't disappoint as some ""sophomore"" offerings do. Whereas RW&A was more upbeat and energetic, Blind is somewhat darker and moodier, and my preferred of the two. It is a beautiful and melodic album, with a some edgy guitars still present.Harriet Wheeler's lovely, songbird voice has a bell-like quality enhanced by fine vocal phrasing. I once tried to sing along with her but couldn't follow her phrasing. Alas, I could phrase like this only in my dreams.One disturbing note: one night when watching the telly I see slo-mo footage of the famous Budweiser's clydesdales galloping with Harriet's voiceover singing, ""wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away..."" Geez--I could see Chimay Grand Reserve, but Budweiser?! Sometime later I felt further nauseated when my all-time favorite Smith's song ""How Soon Is Now?"" showed up in a commercial hawking cars.Ah, commerce."
5,Sundays' Best,"This is The Sundays at their best, the full realization of their sound. ""Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic"" is essential with it's ""The Smiths with female vocals"" sound, but ""Blind"" is pure Sundays. The consistently haunting atmosphere of this record makes ""Blind"" my personal favorite. ""Blood On My Hands"" says it all.The Sundays albums in descending order (according to me):1. ""Blind""2. ""Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic"" (very close second)3. ""Static & Silence"" (as much as I love this album, it's not as consistent or ""magical"" as the first two.)I highly recommend all three."
4,Blind,I currently listen to this CD a lot. Harriet Wheeler's voice and David Gavurin's acoustic guitar are wonderful. The 'Wild Horses' cover in itself makes this compilation a value.
5,The Best The Art The Everything,"Most bands fail in the #2. This was the Sundays Perfection. No Doubt. I saw them support ""Blind"" in Austin back in 95 and the whole UT student union was transfixed by the sounds. Simply Atmospheric LOVE."
4,"""Blind"" makes me glad I'm not deaf.","After listening to their debut ""Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic"", I couldn't imagine that album being topped. But after many spins of this, I see that it was done. It's a very simple formula: strummy alt-pop guitars, happy catchy melodies, and the beautiful and hypnotic voice of Harriet Wheeler. To me, ""The Sundays"" lay somewhere between ""The Ocean Blue"", and ""The Cocteau Twins"". I'm not a big fan of the art, but you know what they say, you can't judge a cd by it's cover."
5,so amazing...,"Blood on your hands, Love, I feel...this album is brilliant..it puts me in such a melancholic mood, i drift away between the voice and the dreamy guitars...I wish more albums made me feel this way...Buy this album, you wont regret it..."
4,Wild Horses...absolutely breathtaking,"I initially bought the cd for the song Wild Horses, after I fell in love with it on the movie Fear.I think most of the songs were a little repetitive... until Wild Horses. It is a breathtaking song that I have never gotten sick of. Sometimes it makes me cry."
4,Fullfills the expectations created by their impressive debut,"One thing for which the Sundays deserve extra credit for is the fact that they have chosen to be melodic and abstract rather than catchy or easy . Their pop reveals it's secrets slowly , with repeated listenings . Second album "" Blind "" shares the same elements which made debut "" Reading , Writing ... "" such a stand out release some years earlier . Harriet Wheeler sings like an angel while her husband's sweet guitar compositions keep getting more and more fascinating as seconds go by . Highlight "" Goodbye "" is just perfect yet pay special attention to "" Love "" on which Wheeler shouts the magic four-letter-word on the refrain in the most heartfelt way possible ."
3,Beautiful music. Singing should've been better and clearer.,"This album has some very pretty music in it. However, the singing by Harriet Wheeler is a bit cheesy and sometimes unclear. I can't understand what she's saying in some of the songs on this CD. ""Wild Horses"" is a very moving song and is sung quite well. ""Goodbye"" is also cool. A few of the songs sound terrible. If you like feel-good music, then you'll probably like this album. What else can I say? Try it for yourself and see what you think."
2,"""Bland"" would be a more accurate title","Disclaimer: Big time fans of The Sundays should not read this review since they obviously will not like it. This review is for casual listeners to give them an unbiased account of the music on the album. Thank you.For the rest of us, The Sundays sophomore album is largely a snoozefest of interchangeable songs. If you've heard the band's one big original hit, ""Here is Where the Story Ends"" from their debut album, you know the drill; mid tempo accoustic rock augmented by Harriet Wheeler's little girl voice. The problem is that the band rarely comes up with a good hook to give its songs vitality. It is no accident that by far the best performance here is the rousing cover version of The Stones' ""Wild Horses."" The sharpness of Jagger-Richards's songwriting makes the rest of the material pale even more in comparison.Overall, a bland period piece with one cover track to at least partially redeem it."
5,Of the three Sundays albums I keep with this,"So beautifull, so dark, so poetic, so sensual, so melancholic, what else can we say? how can we better express our sorrow for love lost? how can we be more nostalgic about somebody or self death as in ""goodbye""? how can we express our sexual desire for someone as in ""more""? or love ourselves as in ""love""? like this songs theres a whole bunch of ways to express that kind of human feelings, this album is full of beautifull emotions and that make it so special , every human being with blood on their veins should have it if at least once in the lifetime has feel love, depression, melancholy, hope and sadnessHM"
5,Good falling in love music!,"I was 16 when this album came out. When I first heard the song ""Love"" I had to own ""Blind"". I thought it was a beautiful song (especially for the early grunge-soaked 90's). I was afraid the rest of the album wouldn't resemble the tone of the song I went nuts over. But by the end of the night when I bought the album, I had listened to it several times in a row. Very rich and emotional but never soft easy listening (the lyrics forbid it to be). Now I'm going on 23 and I look at ""Blind"" as really good falling in love music. Mostly because of memories I guess. It's personal to me, and I recommend it to you. One last thing; the final track, ""Wild Horses"", it's what butterflies in your stomach might sound like. God that's bad!"
3,"Old ""Horses""","One thing that should be mentioned is that the track that most people here are raving about, ""Wild Horses,"" is not a Sundays original but instead an old Rolling Stones song. The Sundays rework it to great effect, though.This CD is pretty good, but I find a lot of the songs (even the alt-hit ""Love"") to be too repetitive. Static & Silence is now far and away my favorite Sundays CD."
3,It's OK,"I like the voice of the lead singer, but the band is sub par, and there are only a few tracks that I can listen to."
5,Very nice product,"I have the replacement battery for Sony DVR 285 for more than a year now, and it still work very well it gave me more than 500 min. after full charge. I highly recommend this product.If you like recording for long time like me you will like it even I used about 3 tape of 8mm each about 120min and still my Sony camcorder works perfectly... very nice product of course."
5,FANNY DVD,This is a lovely film from 1960. It's beautifully made and worth seeing for the performances of the entire cast.
1,Mess From a Masterpiece,"This is surely the worst movie ever re-made from an original masterpiece. The characters act like human embodiments of cartoon figures. Even the famous ""hat scene"" turned from a superb, amusing set piece into a bad clown act.The Marseilles scenery is magnificent, yet the whole is horribly stage-bound. Scores of super-close pictures of Horst Buccholz's face (in unmatching sizes) but not much of Leslie Caron's gracefulness and beauty. Maurice Chevalier is restrained and touching, but everybody else is in a high school farce. YOU MUST WATCH THE ORIGINAL: The Marseilles trilogy from the early 30s--better, funnier, more touching, a work of art."
5,I love Piggers!,This is a beautiful calendar and all the pigs are awesome! I miss my pigger named Gizmo I lost in Dec. of last year. Either way if your a guinea pig lover you will delight in this calendar and I highly recommend it! Enjoy!
1,Beware! minus one star.,"The Answer- The Bible that leads you away from God-by the words of man scattered throughout this book.Beware of the snare of man.The Bible plus man-The Bible plus the world religons-What do Hindus? Buddhists? Muslums? New Age? believe?A little leven levens the whole lump. Gal. 5: 9 1 Cor 5: 6Mix truth and error and get what? The devils bible? The devil just wants a little piece- a foothold.The 3 to one Bible, for every 3 pages of bible one article is added - topics very from worry to sexual pleasure. I have never read a Bible with the words of man in it before. I was shocked.As a publisher if I had to add a devotional- I'd put it in a seperate book- but if I had to add a devotional- I would put it in the back not mix it in the text of God's holy word.Rev. 22: 18- 19 Dont add to or take away from the words of this book.Why read the Bible if you dont follow it or believe it?I was shocked.I did not buy a Bible to get Max Lucado."
5,INSPIRING,"This book is a God sent! I have been blessed by it tremendrously. It is inspiring and I cannot part with it, ever? It is money well spent and have no regrets at all. I will recommend it to all readers, this bible is fantastic and a must have! It has got my full backing 100%. It is a five star!"
1,Nirvana - The most overrated band ever?,"Nirvana is one of those bands that every ""wanna be"" depressed angsty tween scribbles the name furiously on their backpacks. First lets start off with a couple of rumors that everyone seems to cut themselves by. No I DO NOT think that Nirvana by it's simple guitar riffs and mubly singer have in any way pioneered new rock. People forget that bands that were playing then (Tool, Nine Inch Nails) also had a lot to do with the way coontemporary rock is played. The only reason that Kurt Cobain even became popular is simply because he was too much of a wuss to deal with his life and stuck needles in his arms to blow his face away. Yes, Nevermaind has some good songs, but not freaking revolutionary stuff here! People, don't fall into this game that everyone feels they are a part of. It's not real, look away, you'll survive your teen years..."
1,"Loudness War Garbage, Original Sounds Better","Don't waste your money on this version. The remastering is terrible, highly compressed, and the original recording sounds superior in every way. You don't even need a high end stereo system to tell the difference."
1,I loved it till it quit working,"It quit working after about 2 months. It receives but won't transmit. I haven't gotten around to returning it yet.edit: Wow, I just saw what they are selling it for now. Amazing. I think I paid about $80 for it."
2,"Good songs, bad quality","There is nothing wrong with the performance of Ike and Tina on this double Cd. It's the sound quality that is disappointing. There are much better quality Ike and Tina compilations for sale so stay away from this one. Go for ""back in the days"" , ""Dues Paid vol.1"" or ""Proud Mary- the best of Ike and Tina""."
3,"Like the first one, this game is ahead of its time.","Seriously, You should wait for some of next years hardware to play this on. I was on a 2.4 Ghz machine with 1 GB of RAM and a Nvidia 5600 with 256 MB of Video RAM and could not get a resolution above 800x600 without it getting choppy.The gameplay itself was great. The game had all the intrige of the first one. It has a great story and the changes to the biomod system where easy to get used to.But the big black mark against it, is that it requires heavy hardware before it looks as good as it should. The 1.1 patch helped a lot with the game play aspects that where console oreintated, but didn't help much with the engine. I should note, that there are tools to help with the technical shortcomings of the game, but one should not have to do this to play a game that is well above the minimal specs on a game."
1,What a Waste,"Too bad Eidos wasted all this time on a rush job... it's a pity they didn't take the time to debug and do it right; instead they rushed it resulting in many bugs and tied it to specific video cards. The first Deus Ex was great, albeit buggy too, but this thing is worthless. Don't buy Eidos games until they get their act together and return this if you bought it, make the retailers pressure them to fix stuff."
2,not as great as I was hoping for,this is the second game in the series and it does not hold up to the awesome nature of the first game unfortunately. I guess they ran out of ideas because this one is not as open ended and you are able to do a whole lot less in this game than in the first.
2,A poor sequel,"I loved the first but this game went backward in every direction creating poor gameplay, less RPG, horrible shooter stance and only a marginal storyline. The storyline was the only thing that kept me playing. I finished it but was deeply dissapointed. I would suggest not playing this and just taking another run through Deus Ex instead."
3,Close but no cigar,"Basically I was dissapointed by this game, after being a huge fan of the original there was a great deal of anticipation, sadly however the game did not live up to my expectations. I blame this on its joint Xbox/PC origins and the fact the game had been over simplified. This dumbing down was my main cause of irritation. However I suggest for all those who bought Deus Ex 2 they should go to www.dx2rebirth.off2picproduction.com to get the high quality skins.To be fair to the developers its hard to perfect perfection, and the original Deus Ex will always remain a genre defining masterpiece. In short only buy this game if you have finished Deus Ex and still want more from the same universe."
3,A sequal thats far from equal,"The first Deus Ex was an extremely fun game to play. I had high hopes for the sequal but while some of the new physics (ragdoll effects) were a nice change, the interface changes were a turn for the worse. It felt like a console game and for me thats a big negative. I don't really care to see the inventory screen on top of everything and I don't see why they had to dumb down the handling of ammunition and lockpicks. It was obviously designed with a minimum of controls in mind but is that neccessarily an improvement. I don't think so. What happened to the days when a game was redesigned to be ported to console?Even all the conspiracies in the plot seemed somewhat less interesting in this game. Overall though it was entertaining and while maybe not worth the full price at its release, if you can find it cheap it's a worthwhile buy. If you have to choose though and you don't own the original, buy that one instead."
4,Not Quite as Good As the 1st Game,"This was a fun game, all though it wasn't as good as the first game. ( which by the way if you haven't played it you are missing out on one of the GREATEST GAMES EVER !!!) Ion Storm did make the game a little easier...for example one ammo fits all...but I was put off by some of the blurry settings..nanite swell 11????? made it difficult to really explore those areas. All in all considering the price...less than $5.00...a very nice game to play & re-play."
3,Stripped,"This game has been stripped down from its predecessor, and made more basic.One annoying thing about the game is when you switch screens on the console you can't go from bio-mod to inventory without first returning to the game. This game is average at best."
4,Deus Ex: Invisible Wars is a classic.,"Just as one can point to certain books or films that we call ""classics"" due to their influence within the medium, so Deus Ex:Invisible Wars is such in the world of videogames. IT was one of the pioneers of games where the moral decisions made by the player greatly influences the ending. I highly recommend it."
2,"Looked great, but came in wanting........","I waited in eager anticipation for the release of DE:IW, but must admit to being sorely disappointed when I played it. Whilst the graphics are a noticible upgrade to the original the game play, characters, weapons, upgrades and biomods were nothing on the first Deus Ex.After forking out a couple of hundred bucks for a new graphics card (that included a pixel shader!!!) this game became a very expensive lesson. A glossy package and a brillant original do not guarantee a good sequal."
3,"So Far, So Good","I was apprehensive from the ads that this was targeted to a much younger audience than the first game, but upon playing the demo, it looks like they might have kept the dark atmosphere that was the core of the first game. At least it wasn't annoying like Unreal 2. As for how much gear you need, I was able to play the(very short)demo on a PIII 700 with an old ATI 8500 card. My advice would be to download the demo before you buy it."
1,Horrible Decisions,Whoever decided to choose a graphics engine that will not run on sub-$200 graphics cards should be fired.
3,"Not bad, Not great either","You need a hefty computer to handle the graphics. I had turn the graphics to lowest and was still laggy. This games storyline requires you to play Deus Ex in order to understand it. Basically, get Deus Ex and forget about invisible war until you beat Deus Ex."
4,"Great, but. . .","Deus Ex 2 of the best games I've played. The graphics are awesome. The physics are better than any other game I have ever played. Sound, CHECK! Story, very deep. Action packed. Multiple story paths are very awesome. You can really do many different styles of play from stealthy to KILL ALL!But. . .This game could have been more than what it is. I would say that almost all of the levels were way too small! DX1 had huge levels. The graphics are sweet, but c'mon, all the levels are in darkness. I'm sick of games doing this ""darkness"" thing, I spent practically the whole game in nightvision mode. The time you'll get out of this is alright, but I only got about 15 hours, DX1 took me over a day of game time to finish. I'm not a huge fan of cinema scenes, but DX2 doesn't even have one! Not even at the end. I beat the game, it did a short little voice-over, and then BOOM, the main menu!?!? Not even any credits!Is this game great? Yes. But it could have been so much better."
2,Should still play on GeForce 4's...,"I havn't played the actual game, only the demo.. game looks fantastic... but I get unplayable frame rates with a 2.4ghz p4, 512corsair xmx 3200 and a 4600.. unacceptable.. all my friends who have gf4's have same problem.. guess it's time to upgrade to a dx9 card :/"
4,I'm sure a great game but I'm too old,I'm an old fella with too much time on my hands. I really didn't understand what this game was when I ordered it but I sure found out when it came. I am absolutely certain that this is a fabulous game for someone 45 or 50 years younger than myself. It has great graphics and all of the gore a person could want. I highly recommend it for the young'uns.
1,Take this bio-mod to the trash bin,"This game is terrible in every way possible. The graphics actually take a step backward from the first Deus Ex. The RPG element that was so great in the first game was hacked into pieces for this game, making it nearly unplayable. The plot is perhaps one of the worst I have ever encountered. The maps are small, which means very little exploring.Overall, this game is not worth the box it comes in. I am very disappointed that Eidos would slap together a game like this and unleash it on the public. Shame on you Eidos. We know you are capable of so much more!Deus Ex Invisible War = Terrible = Buy Deus Ex Game of the Year Edition."
1,DEUS NOOS,"WHAT A DISAPPOINTING MESS.UNLIKE THE ORIGINAL, THIS GAME IS SO FRAGMENTED AND DISJOINTED STORY LINE AND INTERACTIONS SUCK !!!I AM TEMPTED TO JUST CALMY WRAP IT UP AND PUT IT OUT TO PASTURE.EXCEPT FOR THE $50.00 I SPENTGAME JUST PLAIN STINKS, I CAN'T BELIEVE THE HYPE. I HAD SUCH GREAT HOPES, THEY HAVE BEEN CORRUPTED. TOO BAD , GAME AND TITLE HAD SO MUCH PROMISESTICK TO THE ORIGINAL, IT WAS A ""GREAT GAME"""
2,Here's the real conspiracy,I've played the demo and it was poor. Other reviewers have played the entire game and thought it was poor. Even the American messages boards are saying its poor.Yet the games magazines still give it a score of 90+ precent!!So here's my conspiracy theory: who's paying them to score it so high?I'd spend time pondering that instead of playing this game - it would be time better spent.
2,"The name ""Deus Ex"" should not be part of its title","When viewed apart from the would-be Deus Ex franchise, this is an OK game. Not one I'm really glad I bought, but not overly horrible to play either. It feels like a console game that's been ported to PC.But, since they did tout this as a sequel to the first DX, I think all and any comparative criticisms are valid. Basically, this game lacks so much of the depth, intelligence, and COMPLEXITY of the first game, I can't bring myself to keep playing it. It's like they didn't have any clue why the first one was so endearing to most of its fan base.I'll be sticking to the occasional nostalgic return to playing the first title once in a while. Playing this one just makes me sad."
1,Pale Imitaion,"This game was made for the console only, all the great things about the first one have been taken out, from the skill sets, ammo, reloading, the inventory. Everything has been super simplified so now its a FPS not an action rpg. ALso your looking about around 15 hours of gameplay. The most revolutionary thing they did in this game was put in the console market nowing it it is going to sell well becuase it has a great name. FOrgot to mention a very weak AI and no head shots or body specific damage like the first one. They should of named it DIET Deus Ex"
1,DON'T BUY THIS OR ANY EIDOS MERCHANDISE!!!,"I would highly reccommend going to a store and looking at the system requirements before you buy this game from Amazon. They dont show them to you on the website, and Eidos has decided to randomly not support some of the best graphics cards on the market, including the NVIDIA GeForce4 MX card, which i have on my computer. Despite this, they have decided to allow other NVIDIA cards to work with the game, although they are worse than the card that they don't allow. I'm going to start a holdout on Eidos merchandise because of their idiocy with system requirements and bugs in the games, and i would reccommend you do too. This game cost me 50 bucks, and if i were you be sure you check every square inch of the game before you buy it."
2,What happened?,"I had so much anticipation for this game, and like most everyone who played Deus Ex 1 could not wait for this. But what happened? Well I don't know but this just isn't the sequel to Deus Ex that I was hoping for.First off Alex Brandon's soundtrack to DX 1 was the best of any game I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. It was perfect for the game but it is just a let down here. They also did the unthinkable by taking away the points system. The levels are too small as well, and where in DX 1 there were so many ways of advancing in a level, IW is pretty straight forward comparitively speaking. This game was a total let down for me and as much as I wanted to love it, after beating it several times I just couldn't. And Gameplay? What gameplay? If you are thinking about buying it and really loved Deus Ex 1 you might want to skip it."
2,Crashing Disappointment,"One of the best PC games ever (Deus Ex) has been ruined in a lame-ass console port sequel. The maps are tiny because they were simultaneously developed for XBox, which only has 64 Meg of Ram. Similarly, the outdoor environments are claustrophobic, and there's never many characters onscreen at any one time. The text is HUGE (again, lame-ass console port) and the gameplay has been dumbed down. The story is interesting, but so many off-topic journeys are possible that you completely lose track of the through-line. Buy CHROME instead, the awesome and exciting sci-fi PC shooter which is the game INVISIBLE WAR should have been."
3,I was disappointed...,"Yeah, this really suffers form Consolitus... Meaning while developped along side a console version alot of the game and it game play stem from optimization for a Consol rather then a PC. Pick one or teh other then port over guys..."
3,Eh...It's Ok; Not Great,"I am an avid science/math reader and when I discovered that my friend had this book, I borrowed it from him.The book discusses a whole range of things about phosphorus including its discovery, how it was first manufactured from urine and feces, how its chemical yield was later significantly improved by manufacturing it from bone instead, its influence in bombings during WWII, its use in pesticides/herbicides, anecdotes of people using it to poison others, its possible influence in spontaneous combustion, etc.What most disappointed me about the book I think is that it just seemed like a random catalog of anecdote after anecdote. The content did not flow in a way that I cared for. That's not to say there isn't some interesting information covered in it, but I've read better books. This one's maybe worth checking out at the library and reading once if you're into science/science history, but that's about it."
3,Mugler Deodorant Stick,"Product wasn't in original box, nor was it sealed. Other than that, not sure if it was a recent product or one that sat on the shelf for a few years."
5,A must have!,"This is essential for any true Nirvana fan. The songs range from pop-punk (Been a Son, Sliver), to hard rock (Dive, Anyeurysm), to all out grunge (Hair-Spray Queen, Big Long Now). It's definately the most diverse Nirvana album. This is a truly great album and anyone who doesn't like it (but sems to like Nevermind) is a poser!"
5,Overlooked album,"This albm was inexplicably ignored by radio when it came out. I don't recall hearing Dive or Aneurysm nearly as much Smells Like Teen Spirit or All Apologies. Yet the album, I feel, is as good as Nevermind and better than In Utero. The songs are raw and unpolished, which would make most bands sound horrible, but not Nirvana. They are much too talented for that. There are some cover tunes as well, which are probably better than the originals, given the talent Kurt Cobain had with voice and guitar. Some of the track titles are humorous too, such as Aero-Zepplin, which pokes fun at 1970s era rock 'n roll. Buy this album whether you like Nirvan a lot or a little. It is a totally overlooked recording."
5,THIS IS WHAT NIRVANA IS ALL ABOUT,"THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST NIRVANA CD THERE IS AND EVER WAS. THIS CD IS AWESOME, ITS NIRVANA AT THEIR BEST AND THEM HAVING FUN, DOING WHAT THEY DID BEFORE THEY WERE FAMOUS SUCH AS COVERS AND MORE PUNK ROCK SOUNDING SONGS, THIS IS A MUST HAVE CD FOR ANY NIRVANA FAN, EVEN FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ONLY BOUGHT NEVERMIND CUZ IT WAS THE COOL THING TO DO, ITS JUST AWESOME, U GOTTA LISTEN TO IT TO KNOW WHAT IM REALLY TRYING TO SAY SO JUST BUY IT!!"
5,Rarities and Out-takes make up a Classic Album!,"For a compilation album, Incesticide still gives the feel of a proper LP. Each song is experienced in its roughest form, giving it a certain appeal of its own. The album's first three tracks are by far the best - starting wityh the classic 'Dive', a mixture of pounding bass riff and heavy guitar harmony. This is probably my favourite track from the album. The most complex song has to be 'Big Long Now'. It is incredible - Kurt's weary vocals are supported by the crude guitar line, whilst the bass line mainly keeps the song together. It is a superior track from the band, taking a closer look into the more indie aspect of their music. A great album, well worth the buy!"
5,my nirvana collection,"this is an album full with rarities and good songs, i enjoy it to much, and i need it to replace the old one that i lost with this"
3,Still ATough One to Pass Up,"If Nirvana has Punk in their musical style, than this one is even more so. The good thing is the price for the album, even if you only come away with a few songs from this, it still gives you more Nirvana. The songs aren't off beat as their other albums, just Punk style with Punk beats just about straight through. The last three songs on this are more Grunge and off beat and what I would've expected. Now with Insecticide(Demos and outtakes and BBC sessions) does show the band's variety with their music as a whole. Their three studio albums don't really sound alike. So this just adds to the mix. Though not my cup of tea, I did pick up a few songs from this album. Again, I think for the affordable price, it's worth picking up. It is a tough one to pass up if you're left wanting more Nirvana."
4,album 2.5,"This was released during the peak of Nirvana's popularity (after Nevermind but before In Utero) to give the fans something to get them thru until the new album.I'm guessing some of these are ones that didn't make the cut for Nevermind.Good songs, all of them, some are real good."
2,Some ok songs...,"INCESTICIDE got some decent Nirvana songs like DIVE, ANEURYSM and Sliver...but is by far the worst album by nirvana...Nevermind and In Utero are good albuns, but this one and their debut BLEACH are really not so good...Well, the nirvana mania is totally unexplicable...i think if someone deserve to be a Grunge legend, it got to be Alice in Chains, 100 times better than nirvana..."
5,MY Nirvana experience...,"This was MY Nirvana album I was listenening to in Jr. High... Nevermind was great, but that was the polished up multi-platinum monster that made them famous, everone heard ""Come as you are"" or ""Teen Spirit""... but these were the gems to me ""Dive"", ""Sliver"" ""Mexican Seafood""... those songs are the ones that take me back... to the good ol' days."
3,punk/grange compilation,"this cd isnt the best nirvana work ever but its far from the worst cd out there its raw nirvana thats y i liek it but it has alot of stuff on it i wouldnt recomend this to anyone who is just starting with nirvanaStand out songs: silver, stain, aneurysm, been a son"
5,"Buy this album, & read this!","I just bought a new copy of this disc and noticed the awesome linear notes had been removed from the booklet, its now just a four panel with the pictures/song info in the inner two pages. Im guessing that all recent pressing of Incesticide are like this. Just wanted to let you folks know. If you want to read those notes I bet there somewhere on the net, or you could always find a used copy as well. None the less... Buy this album, its one of the greatest!"
4,"""MEXICAN SEAFOOD"" IS DISGUSTING!","the song ""mexican seafood"" is the most disgusting ever heard.i'd rather not hear about his strange sicknesses.(but the rest of the album is pretty good)"
3,not their best,nirvana is the best group ever but in this cd they tried to make themselves look bad so that they could at least try to have a normal life this cd is good but not their best
3,Good collection of stuff,"I quite liked this, especially the first seven or so songs, very catchy. As for the guy commenting on Appetite ofr Destruction, well, let's just just say I'm not into homophobic, sexist, no brainer singers like Axl Rose. Yeah, he was a good front man butit stops right there. Kurt Cobain had integrity and a writing craft to rival many..."
3,I agree with the other guy,"yah seriously don't get this unless you've heard all the other Nirvana albums. I was quite disapointed and understand why it's a b-side album...First of all it sounds too much like light punk for my taste, when i listen to Nirvana i want to hear some true blooded grunge. The only songs that i really love are Anuerysm(best on the album) and Aero Zeppelin...Anuerysm espeacilly because to be honest it's one of my favorite songs from Nirvana.Anyways, yes please get In Utero, Nevermind, and Bleach before this. Overall i don't think this is worth 3 stars but since it's Nirvana it get's some extra points ;-)"
5,Raw Nirvana,"This album contains various b-sides and rare stuff...this is Raw nirvana, full of Punk anger and not polished by producers (maybe except ""Dive"" that sounds like all songs from nevemind)..teh rawness of production makes it so special and great - it gives a full view how nirvana was playing in earlier days when they were not famous and so popular (""Beeswax"")...simple but magnificent wall of sound...a bit avatgarde and madness are hiding beneath it...It is Grunge straight from the angry heart (Of Kurt,Chris and Dave)..."
1,Very poor !,"Nothing else to say, the only good cd from this band is MTV unplugged.The music of Nirvana is far superior in acoustic version in my opinion."
4,Not up to Nirvana's standards,"Well, it's Nirvana, so of course it's good. But I guess I've just been spoiled by the band's other stuff. Some of the tracks were good, granted, but Incesticide does NOT live up to Nirvana's best. But despite all that, it's fair...I'd still recommend the CD, but don't expect something like In Utero, or even Bleach."
4,Alright Album --,"Unlike all the other Nirvana albums, I can't sit through this one. The songs are alright, but on the other Nirvana albums, EVERY-SONG is a #1 hit. They had huge expectation, and I guess they got too nervous. Good album never the less, but unless you're a die-hard Nirvana fan, you're not going to like this album. Go for In Utero."
4,Kurt Lives,Kurt is probably the only one who could describe the essence of life besides Frank Black -- Kurts inspiration of course is THE MAN himself ... the best ... album out there right now - Insecticide speaks miles in the face of rock and roll - peace out!
5,One of the best compilations out there.,"There are very few compilation CD's that are actually good. This is one of them. Nirvana's Incesticide is packed with 15 songs guaranteed to rock you no matter what. ""Dive"", ""Sliver"", ""Son of a gun"", ""Hairspray Queen"", ""Aero Zeppelin"", and ""Aneurysm"" are my favorite songs on here. This is essential for any Nirvana fan's collection.My only complaints are: why is ""Downer"" on here? You can already find that on the Bleach album. Also, I didn't like ""Big Long Now"" because it seemed to drag a little, but those are just minor complaints .NOTE: Pick up Kurt Cobain's Journals to find the lyrics to some of these songs."
1,Buyer beware,"The book arrived with yellowed pages. The ""included"" CD was not in the book. This is the first book from Amazon were I've been disappointed with the shipment."
3,This is a good book...,"This is a good introduction about IT Project Management, but it does not prepare for the Project+ test.Regardless, I think this book should be readed because It is very interesting and well-written."
4,Hide,"At first I didn't think I was going to like this film but it drew me in and I really liked it. It's odd, a little disturbing and the ending is not exactly clear to me but overall I thought it was good. Rachel Miner was not very good in it, her accent was awful! However, Christian Kane was unbelievably good and was able to make up where she was lacking. If you don't mind the violence and appreciate something a little different then this is a must see."
1,Disappointing attempt at noir,"Main problem is that the plot doesn't make much sense, and the couple at the center of the action are not very engaging, or even interesting. The strongest part of the movie is the 'ghost town' setting in the second half, but a lot of this potential is squandered by meaningless 'twists'. The ending is unconvincing and unsatisfying, as well as leaving an unpleasant taste behind."
4,One Major Flaw,"Christian Kane was excellent in this film!I wasn't impressed with Rachel Miner's depiction...it was kind of over the top, and her accent was horrible! Still, I liked all the twists and turns of the plot, and enjoyed that it was mostly just the two main characters, and their relationship, that was the focus of the film.I would have given this film 5 stars, but as a hearing-impaired person, I was very upset that the only closed-captioning was in Spanish!"
1,All Talk and No Action,"I was expecting some great Bonnie & Clyde action scenes...all I got was talk...no action. Two wannabe actors/actresses make this film a total flop. There's much more hype here than what you can truly expect. I should have known better. If you want a REAL Bonnie & Clyde flick, don't miss ""Natural Born Killers""...the best of the best. ""Hide"" from this film. And once you ""Hide""...don't seek!"
3,Kossoff shines without Free,"Contrary to what the above profile says , this album dates from 1973 , not 1977. After Free crashed and burned the first time , Paul Rodgers went on to a trio called 'Peace' and Andy Fraser went on to a power trio called 'Toby'. Neither of these conglomerations released any product so this is the only recorded project after Free's first break-up(actually Peace released one song on the 'Free Story'). This is not all that bad either , the production is weak and Rabbits arrangements are lifeless, but all parties did thier best to let the spotlight shine on Kossoff. He plays some excellent lead on ""Just for the box"" , ""Yellow House"" & ""Sammy's Alright"". Simon Kirke gets to debut his future Bad Company chestnut ""Anna"". Considering Kossoff only released four non-Free LP's , we have to make do with what we have. Not his Best , but far from his worst. I enjoy this LP often , and wish there was more."
3,Subpar songs,"While it's always exciting to hear Paul Kossoff play guitar, this album doesn't do much in the way of adding anything substantial to his legacy. Yes, his tone is tasteful and his solos are satisfying, but unlike Free's output, the songs on KKTR are marginal at best. ""Sammy's Alright"" and ""Blue Grass"" are okay, but don't come close to ""Fire and Water"" or ""Oh I Wept."" I typically love side-project albums, but this one is mediocre at best. If you own Free's entire catalogue, go with ""Back Street Crawler,"" Kossoff's first solo album."
2,Jerzee T-Shirt,OK quality. Sized 1 1 1/2 sizes too small before washing. Not near size recommendation. My wife has a new sleep shirt.
1,Quality is poor. Head for Hanes or Fruit of the Loom,"I bought the white undershirts. Very poor quality compared to others I have bought. like Jockey, Kirkwood, Hanes."
1,Insipid,"I couldn't get past 30 pages of this vapid book. In the first chapter, the main character Robert falls madly in love with a German Count and soon the two are planning their wedding, after only having met a few days before! They have brunch at an exclusive, hard-to-get-into restaurant, but somehow Robert's friend gets a table to spy on them?? The plot only gets more ludicrous, and unfortunately none of the characters are even likeable (let alone more than caricatures), so I just tossed this book."
3,About as good as the first,"Second book in a gay murder/mystery/comedy. Robert Willsop is swept off his feet by a rich German count. His ridiculously hot best friend Michael (handsome, rich and dumb) is outraged. His lesbian friend Monette is happy for him. Robert and the count fly off to Germany to stay in the count's house. Also immediately the count is stabbed to death. Robert is horrified but Michael and Monette come to his rescue.The first was good if stereotyped. The second I found easier to take. The stereotypes are there but Robert comes off as not being such a whiner and Michael is a little more bearable this time around. It moves quickly, is lots of fun to read and is a quick, easy mindless read. Perfect for the beach."
2,Disappointing,"I was extremely disappointed by this book. One of the worst things one can say about a comedy or a ""humorous"" book, is that it lacks humor. The ""humor"" in the book is not funny; coming across as a strained attempt to be funny but failing. ..."
1,Counterfeit CD,"The CD sent to me is an illegal pirated counterfeit. Amazon should ban this supplier immediately. Even the cover is a poorly copied digital copy of the original.Hawaii artists struggle to make any money from their unique music, Amazon should not be a party to cheating these musicians out of their royalties."
3,"Good, semi-clean, quirky fun","I bought this album, stereotypically, for ""Buddy Holly"", but when I listened to the whole thing, I liked all of it. My favorite is ""The Sweater Song"", a.k.a., ""Undone"". I love pointlessness. ;) This album is a good one, and I'd advise anyone to go ahead and check it out."
4,Good Cd,This is a really good cd. Weezer is a really good band. Their music is on the mellow side so if you like stuff like that I recomend it.
5,It Rocks Because It Rocks!,This album has everything going for it including but not limited to Rocking! and Rocking! and Rocking! In conclusion this albums Rocks!
5,Classic album,"Even though I'm not a die hard Weezer fan, this album is just too good to deny. Weezer is truly original and their ability for such melodic and catchy songs is what makes them so great. And its hard to believe how clever the lyrics are. (Come on- ""If you want to destroy my sweater/hold this thread as I walk away""!? So great...)'Say it ain't So', 'Buddy Holly, and 'Only in Dreams' really stand out for me. I remember hearing these songs way back in '94/'95 and they've really stayed with me because when I picked it back up I found I remembered every word and every chord of the guitars. I love it when albums are like that. I think its a true sign of greatness."
5,AWESOME Album!!!,"I am a HUGE fan of Weezer, have been for years. If for some ODD reason you've never heard of them, do yourself a favor and pick up this there very FIRST Album. I've found myself listening to it over and over and over again. There ain't one bad song on this album."
5,One of the Top 5 albums of the 90's,"This album to me is the best alternative rock cd ever. Every song on here is amazing, there is not one weak song in the album, this album is an essential, I recommend this cd to everyone, no matter what the price, it is worth it."
5,5+ stars!,"I'm pretty sure if you don't own this album after reading all these positive reviews...you will. ""Only in Dreams"" (track 10) is my favorite song of all time. So, of course, this CD is one of my favorites as well. EVERY single song on here will get you singing and you'll know all the words in no time. I'm not really into a whole lot of what most people consider ""classic"" albums...but to me, this will be one of them in the future. The lyrics, the music, the solos, the harmonization.....alllll great!"
5,This one of my best CD's and I think they are great.,Weezer aren't very well known in Scotland but some of my friends have this album as well and they think it is great too.PS buy all the Stereophonics CDs you can as they are brilliant.
5,You must own this CD,"I got this CD last Christmas from my brother, and it was one of those gifts I didn't touch until March when it was time to put it away somewhere-- you know, at the bottom of my closet or some such wasteland area of my room. But before I put it away, I decided to listen to it, and it's been my favorite CD ever since. I think ""no one else"" is the coolest. It's the kind of CD you can listen to all the way through all day, and at least I never get tired of it. And that's my glowing recommendation! Buy it!"
5,WEEZER! Need I say more...?!,"This is obviously Weezer's first album, containing the hits Buddy Holly, Undone (the Sweater Song), My Name Is Jonas, Say It Ain't So, In The Garage...Oh wait, I'm listing all of them... well, they're all hits to me!This CD is an excellent way to get started on Weezer. See where they came from, what they sounded like when the began, and then follow their progression as they continued. Their sound never REALLY changed, it just got more refined. This CD is a great mix of that classic garage-punk (grunge) sound without going too heavy. Cuomo sounds great as he belts out his emotions through the microphone, and the music behind every song fits so well, you'll be thinking to yourself, ""Wow! What took me so long to buy this CD?!""So, in case you haven't gathered by now, I would definitely suggest buying this CD. It's that grunge sound without getting overly heavy or just outright stupid, which means ten tracks of great music."
5,Love Love Love it!,"I love every song on this album, it is one of my favoriets. I have seen Weezer live a few times...and it was just amazing.This is a great album, with songs about many different things.A great cd for someone just exprimenting with alternative/rock music.A cd you will never get tired of."
5,possibly my favorite album of all time,"this is one of the best albums ever created. my name is jonas has to be one of the top 10 best songs in modern rock, maybe ever."
1,weak,"This band is beyond laughable, they are a tragedy. Their gimmick is their cheeziness. At least Primus were great musicians. Weezer are weak, weak, weak, weak, weak. But how would you all know? Go ahead, make my day- give me a negative 'was this review helpful' vote. ... Too bad you're the ones who have to listen to this awful music."
5,The Best Weezer!,"I have been a weezer fan from the start(so like when i was 4)! Personally I think Blue Album is the best because it has great guitar parts and lyrics. I think this is a great cd for about anybody(especially if you like alt. and emo). It is great for road trips or just hanging out. If you get this cd you will love it! tracks 1,5,7,8, and the last are the best. The last track starts off quite and kinda quites down and then takes off and really starts rocking! Any weezer cd is good and you will absolutely love it all!"
4,"Great CD, but sound is kinda lame.","This Cd is definitely a good buy, but the first track is extremely boring, as well as the last track. If you like weezer, this is a must buy."
5,"Rivers Cuomo, one of the best songwriters ever","The Blue Album, Weezer's debut, is a spectacular, simple, tuneful record that will get you hooked on this band from the very first notes. Rivers Cuomo's songwriting is so great here that nobody else even compares, not even John Lennon. ""Only In Dreams"" has to be one of the greatest songs ever written. Anyway, the songs bounce with a hummable, tuneful joy rarely heard these days with all the rap-metal, nu-metal clones. From the childhood memories of ""My Name Is Jonas"" to the high school hop of ""Buddy Holly,"" every song could well be part of the soundtrack to your life. ""In The Garage"" pokes fun at geek culture, which the band revels in themselves, and ""Surf Wax America,"" with its classic Beach Boys-esque imagery is pure gold."
5,A modern classic.,"I have been listening to this CD since I was a kid, and since I was a kid, I have loved every track. From ""My Name is Jonas"" to ""Only in Dreams,"" this 10-track CD is a rollercoaster ride through relationships, surfing and the life of a nerd. Rivers' lyrics are hilarious but yet come from real-lfie experiences, which is what makes this CD so genuine. Every song has a life of itself, and of course, this CD wouldn't be what it is without the classic ""In the Garage."" ""Say It Ain't So"" is one of my current favorites, along with ""Holiday"" and ""No One Else."" Hell, if ""Surf Wax America"" doesn't get your toe tapping, you must be dead!"
5,Pop & More,"I recall ""Buddy Holly"" as the first Weezer song I heard. I was unsure as to whether I like it or not. It was too catchy and poppy. But then I realized it was fun and I found myself humming it. As I heard the other songs on the radio I decided I actually like Weezer and bought the recond.The album is pop ear candy with catchy melodies and music - the chorus of the then overplayed Buddy Holly is a good example. But this makes the record one that is just a great one to put on. But there is more to the record than just pop and the lyrics are very good and are not pure pop candy and delves into stories.The record an interesting mix and is just not another pop album or Buddy Holly."
5,i will never forget this album,"This is the first ""rock"" album i ever owned and it is still one of my favorites ever. I could listen to this cd all day and never get tired of it. There is no song on the cd that i even think about skipping. With songs like ""Say it aint so"" and ""Only in Dreams"" you never want the cd to be over. I think this cd is a perfect blend of different kinds of music. I dont think anyone can say they dont like at least one song on this album. A job well done weezer."
5,Alternative Bliss,"There really is nothing more to say than what others have said about this album already. It IS one of the albums that defined the 90's, up there with Nirvana's ""Nevermind"" and ""In Utero"" and The Smashing Pumpkin's ""Siamese Dream"", and others. But it is truly amazing, and they haven't done something as amazing as this since ""Maladroit"", but it is full of the early 90's nostalgia.-:)"
5,really good...,"this album is really good. i really loved it. it was one of the first few albums that i bought when i first started listening to rock, and this was always in my cd player. now that my cd collection has expanded to nearly 300....weezer is still almost always in my CD player. It is an amazing CD, every song is good, and i never skip over any of them. Each song has good lyrics, and is so full that it is crazy. The guys really know how to do their thang...and their thang is definetly music. The CD is so good with lyrics and music, and the fact that all of the songs are amazing! A must have!!"
5,=w= =w= =w= =w= =w= =w= =w= =w= =w= =w=,"This is an AWESOME Cd. I have about 100 Cds and this is my favorite. I got this Cd mainly for Say It Ain't So. Then I heard the rest of the Cd. **It was AWESOME**. I liked this Cd so much that WEEZER became my favorite band. My other favorite bands are Smashing Pumpkins, Toadies, PanterA, and Metallica. If you like any of these bands then you will love WEEZER. When I heard this Cd I went and bought the other WEEZER Cd, Pinkerton. And guess what, that's an AWESOME Cd too. Another good Cd is Rubberneck by the Toadies. That's an AWSOME Cd too."
5,Wow de wow,"A few years ago, I bought this album after seeing Weezer live. To date, it's the best CD I own! It's diverse as to style--you have hyped up and jammin' (""My Name is Jonas,"" ""Surf Wax America""), mellow and slow (""Undone-The Sweater Song,"" ""The World Has Turned and Left Me Here""), just plain fun (""Buddy Holly,""), angst (""Say It Ain't So""), and sadness (""Only in Dreams""). My personal favorites are ""Say It Ain't So"" and ""Only in Dreams,"" but only the first four minutes of the latter. (""Only in Dreams"" is 8 minutes and turns to instrumental after 4; I like it but it gets repetitive.) If you want to have a CD that can keep you flying when you're happy, get this. If you want a CD that can help you when you're angry or sad or emotional, get this. The guitars are fun, at times punk-like, and Rivers Cuomo's voice could put feeling into a State of the Union address. A must have for fans of quirky, AWESOME music."
3,Overated band makes decent album,"Well first off Weezer arent half-bad. They are about average. Their s/t debut is the only album I own. Anyway the music is definitely derivative of the infinitely superior Pixies (who by the way influenced Nirvana, Radiohead and PJ Harvey among others) The album isnt a masterpiece. It wont leave you emotionally drained. It wont impact you on a variety of different levels. It wont change your world view or expectations of what music should be. But it is an enjoyable listen. My favorite songs off of it are:1-The world has turned and left me here2-In the garage (any song that mentions Shadowcat cant be that bad)And if you like this check out these superior albums:Pixies-BossanovaPJ Harvey- 4-track demosRadiohead- The BendsUltimately its a fun little album, that doesnt require much thinking and after too many listens will leave you hungry for something with more substance."
3,Whassamattauu,"Think how great this album would have been if someone had bothered to produce it.With the exception of ""Undone"" and ""Buddy Holly,"" most of these fine songs sound like they were recorded with a single microphone. It's just a dull roar, with the vocals completely lost in the mix and the drums barely audible.That said, ""Buddy Holly"" is an amazing song, an homage to nerdiness which--I can't believe I'm saying this--resulted in a great video. Ralph and Pottsy's reaction to the guitar break is classic."
5,The Inspiration for Many of Musicians,"About a year ago I was really into the rock scene. I was listening to anything from punk to hard rock and anything in between. I was listening to some cover songs from The Deftones and I stumbled upon a cover of a Weezer song entitled ""Say it Ain't So"". I was amazed by how it could stick in my head so! I decided that I would hunt this.......Weezer band down and find out what my friends didn't. I bought this CD and I was amazed..........it was non-fabricated alternative at its finest. I later found out that Weezer was the inspiration for many punk, alternative, and hard rock bands alike. This CD is a no brainer, and should be owned by people of all ages. Check out this CD if you like:Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Deftones, Stone Temple Pilots, and about any other band that was in the ""grunge scene"". Good luck shopping/browsing!"
5,why the blue album rocks my world,"who doesn't love weezer? when they came out they were like the alternative to alternative. the anti- rock stars. but mostly, they're just a bunch of cute geeky guys playing great music. the songs on this album are both heartbreakingly tender and insanely catchy, but it is also legimate rockandroll. weezer unknowingly made being uncool cool."
4,What's Not To love?,"What's Not to love? Weezer has got a great beat that has been working since 1994, even if this was there first and currently as of 1999, their latest CD. Say It Ain't So's melody has a lot of feeling in it, that I can relate to. Undone is a song you can sing over and over, and what to say about Buddy Holly? It speaks for itself.If you like Weezer, Try some Starflyer 59, and some Sunny Day Real Estate. Got To love Them all!~The trouble with life is there's no background music, so make your own soundtrack to life.~ Krissy K.~"
3,Decent,"This is the third Weezer album I bought after ""Maladriot"" and ""Make Believe."" The ""Blue Album"" isn't a great album, but it's better than ""Make Believe."" I don't think it's as good as ""Maladriot."" Some of the songs on the album aren't good, such as ""Surf Wax America,"" ""No One Else,"" and ""Only in Dreams."" I bought it used."
2,Ridiculous!,"Tell me what is so good about Weezer? They come out with a cd with only 10 tracks on it and there's nothing special about it. There was so much hype about ""Weezer"" and this huge album they were putting out. How did so many people get to like this band? Oh I know because they're a bunch of nerds that put out one decent song (Buddy Holly). First of all people treat this album like it's god. It's ridiculous. After hearing the first couple of songs it's like there was no energy. Yes Buddy Holly was excellent. All of the tracks sound the same,[...]Trust me this cd isn't anything special. The Green Album that people say[...]because they're crying about how it's different is Weezers best! It actually has tracks that don't run together."
2,more boring than pet fish,"This cd has 3 good songs: Undone, Say it aint so, and Buddy holly+My name is Jonas= one good song. Weezer's alright...i guess....but they have this huge following and are revered so highly that it takes away from any liking i might have of this band. download the songs or burn the cd....don't waste your money"
2,New Weezer fans should not dig this one up,"After listening to 2001 one a few times, I now listen to it five times a week, can't live without it. So I buy the blue album, yeah I remember these hits, I remember how much they suck, no wonder they broke up and took six years off, This is alternative rock at it's worst, of course you might like it if you wanna relive the music of the early nineties, Many of the old fans don't like the new Weezer, I know understand, Weezer is no longer alternative just a great straight at ya rock n roll band."
2,Overrated,The best songs on this album were the ones I've heard on the radio a million times. Don't waste your money on this CD. Just flip on your local rock station or rip it off the net.
2,Pretty Average,"Weezer is one of those bands that is good for making hit singles. Every song that Weezer has ever released as a single has been pretty good or at least decent. I know Im gonna get told off for this one but Weezer is the like 90's version of CCR. Rivers is a pretty decent guitar player, well when he tries anyways.This album has three songs that I like. I got this because of the song 'Buddy Holly' I love that song, and its a really good song, not a searous song by any means but a pretty good song. 'The Sweater song' is alright and 'Say It Aint So' is the best song on the album because it is the one with the most supstance to it.All the songs on the album have pretty good guitar work like I said but its nothing to listen to repeatedly or anything but its worth getting for 'Buddy Holly' and 'Say It Aint So' wait never mind I still wouldnt recomend getting this album I would just say wait for Weezer to come out with a greatest hits or a best of."
2,weezer ain't that good,"yeah whatever. This album is not a classic by any means, and people are saying it's the group's best ever, so i don't think the group's that great either. Best song BY FAR: Say it ain't so. All the others are either sub-par or just bad. By the way, you should listen to Nirvana if you want real grunge."
1,A rather crappy C.D.,"It would seem that Weezer's recent track ""Beverly Hills"" is one of few I like from the group, for this album didn't really appeal to me at all. In many cases, especially for track #9 (Holiday), the lyrics are hugely lame, sometimes trying to fit the word ""anyway"" into one syllable, or choosing the topic of destroying sweaters. Despite this, I was able to mildly enjoy two tracks on this C.D., one of them being ""Buddy Holly"". This tune is a blend of hard guitars and a melody somewhat similar to Waltzing Matilda. Once again the lyrics are pretty uninteresting, but the progressions and all are fairly good. This song and many of the other tracks are actually very similar to The Ramones, for the chord progressions used are often simple, and when combined with the vocals have a very comparable feel. I would definitely not recommend Weezer's blue album, for what this band is doing on it isn't all that exciting.Recommended tunes:Buddy HollyUndone- the Sweater Song"
4,Favorite Weezer album,The title of the review says it all! Undone is one of my favorites of all time. Favorite Weezer album!
5,buy it right now,"This is an amazing album that is well worth the money. It is arguably one of the top albums of the 90's. The blue album set the standard for most of the geek rock/emo bands out today. This is one of those rare albums that you can listen to from start to finish without wanting to pause or skip a track. You can easily listen to this over and over. It has great opening with My Name is Jonas and ends softly with Only in dreams. Only in dreams is one of those songs you just need to play loud, sit back, listen and enjoy. Other standout tracks include in the garage, holiday, undone, hell the entire album."
5,Wow! This is great!,"If you are a Weezer fan and/or a Blue Album fan, than this is a must have. The first disc is classic but it's the second disc that makes this worthwhile. The second disc is awesome. The music is right in line with the rest of the style of the first disc and rocks."
5,There is nothing like it,This is by far the greatest album I have ever owned. This is the album that defined high school for me. The sund is still fresh and really never has been topped by Weezer. The two greatest tracks on the CD were Only in Dreams and Surf Wax America. Only in Dreams is a tour de force with the greatest climax and ending of any song I have ever heard. Surf Wax America is just awesome. Everything else is awesome too.
5,The Best of the Weeze's work,"Sure, the blue album was only Weezer's first album, but who says the first album cannot be the best? It was my first Weezer album and it opened my eyes to just how much I was missing. I realize that I may sound a bit obssesive, but i already know this about myself. Getting back to the album, it is full of gems, from its hits like Buddy Holly to songs that are just plain classic such as Surf Wax America. I cannot explain to you the total greatnes of this album, so all I have left to say is buy it to see for yourself."
4,The Beach Boys on Drugs.....,"Weezer have a sound that matches no other. They bring together an irresistable blend of power pop, metal, and good-time rock and roll. While the punk rock of ""No one Else"" rouses the senses, the jolly melody of ""Holiday"", takes us all back to the days of beer and babes. A comedic album from the Happy Days stable.....thoroughly enjoyable"
2,disappointing - it couldn't grip me,"A big fan of thrillers I reread this book that I owned when I was young. It couldn't hold my attention. The language is vague, the characters unclear. The plot is in itself interesting but I found the book overall fragmented. My conclusion surprises me but hey, it is what it is ....."
2,"Unlikely main character, too slow and frankly boring","Disapointing story from Ludlum, the main character is unsimpathetic and totally out of place for the task. could not finish this story, and would prefer to give it 1 star but after all it is Ludlum (or is it?)."
2,A Lesson in American Finance,"This book would have been more suitable as a graduate level business course text book rather than as a ""suspence"" novel. It was boring. Although Ludlum is a favorite author, this boring attempt at suspence took him down in my estimation."
3,"good, but out of date","Mr. Ludlum, in his preface to this edition, says that he re-issued this book after Iran-Contra because he felt that it ""mirrored"" in a way, Watergate, but that he didn't want to update the book. I think that it could have done with some updating. The book is a good read--a fast read. I found the lapses in time a little confusing, but I liked Andy & Phyllis. I didn't really know what to do about Madison & Bonner, though. It seemed to be a case of the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing, all throughout the book--which makes it suspenseful, i guess, but rather confusing. I tended to forget who was on which bad-guy team. The ending of the book is pretty predictible once you get to the last few sections--but there are some twists thrown in. A good read if you don't mind low-tech technothrillers."
1,A waste of time,"This book was slow to start, boring in the middle...and I just couldn't get enough interest in it to finish it. The premises are dated and the constant politically-incorrect comments on race and gender were jarring. There really isn't enough story, good writing or interesting characters here - yes, a waste of time. There are so many good books out there - this just isn't one of them."
2,too boring.. too lengthy,"Got frustrated reading this book. No pace. Not for Alistair McLean kind of readers. You can easily quit reading this book even if you are in the middle. I only completed it for the heck of it.. wonder why I started reading it at all. I should have read Detective(Arthur Hailey) instead. Would have insured I finish it in the same night, rather than spread it out over almost 2 weeks, as Trevayne did. However, Trevayne and Bonner did make a good combo. Both had a great character. The only interesting points in the novel are when these two are in conversation or Trevayne is with Sam. Nothing else."
3,"Nice, but, not...........","Content is wonderful. Video is acceptable. Audio is poor, at times incomprehensible. Not recommended. Sorry."
2,UGH,"Terrible. I LOVE alternative music, but this trash is hardly worth listening to.I understand this is ""experimental"" and ""innovational"" but it is a loose can of worms. None of the music is melodic. Some of the riffs are pretty neat with interesting rhythems and intruiging sounds but when Thurston Moore or Kim Gordon (who was 39 when this was recorded. Waaaay past her prime if you ask me) tries to sing, it all falls apart.The guitarists are very, very talented and deserve recognition. But, honestly, I can't see how they can't be like the Pixies and be talented but produce GOOD and LISTENABLE music at the same time. I gave it 2 stars because ""Drunken Butterfly"" Is an awesome song and actually worth listening to all the way through."
1,I Don't Get It,"Clearly I'm far too closed minded for this album. If I wanted to listen to people screaming and crashing and banging completely out of sync I'd open my window at 5am while the neighbors are screaming at each other again and the early-bird construction crew is cutting concrete outside my apartment while the garbage truck is slamming the dumpster onto the pavement repeatedly. Absolutely no musicality, no message, NO TALENT.If I wanted to hear this I could go down to the local foundary yard and listen to them cutting steel.. FOR FREE.I could go into a blow-by-blow for each track on why it's musical murder but that would be a grand waste of my time. Horrible.This is one band that the indie snobs made it ""uncool"" to dislike, so everyone looks around like ""wow this is flippin genious"" while in their heads they can't believe that everyone else likes them and they don't. GET OVER IT. You want arty music, go listen to Sigur Ros or Godspeed you Black Emperor."
5,noise made beautiful,"this is my favorite sonic youth album.'91-'92 were great years for me in music,in that so many great albums came out during this period,most of which i have or will rate eventually.""100%"",""swimsuit issue"",""drunken butterfly"",""shoot"",""sugar kane"",""nic fit"",and ""on the strip"" are my personal favs.if you like noise done right and haven't checked out this band yet than i would start here.if you like this than you are bound to like others like ""goo"" and ""daydream nation"".many have taken gordon and moores cues and used them as if they were their own.never forget where it came from."
5,One of the best alternative albums of the 90's,"This is a great starting point when delving into Sonic Youth's massive catalog of albums. All great songs, and plenty of weirdness and noise, but not too much to turn off a new listener. And the cover is a classic!"
5,A Very Strong CD from one of the best bands of all time,"now first off if your are new to sonic youth or you want to check them out i actually say get this over ""daydream nation"" or ""sister"" this is a great album and u can hear the major difference of what being signed to a major label does. this is the easiest sonic youth album to find by far. now to the real purpose i wrote this review this cd is great dont get me wrong, but i much rather prefer the stoner-noise-confusion-riot-mayhem sound of ""bad moon rising"" or ""confusion is sex/kill yr idols"" to this if you have heard sonic youth before and you love the sons were they go into the weird noises and odd guitar work and tunings than totally go buy those two cds listed previously. sonic youth is one of the best bands ever, and dont put them out till you give them a chance they rule!"
5,pure energy,"This album was an amazing listen. every song was full of energy. this album redeemed sonic youth for me after buying ""a thousand leaves"" which had a lot of slower instrumental type of stuff. This album however had nothing but upbeat listenable material. they did a great cover of ""nic fit"" by the untouchables who are one of the least known dischord records bands of the early years. In my opinion it's even better than ""daydream nation"" which most people say is the best. This is a perfect album for someone wanting to check out sonic youth."
4,The building of a man.,I like the flow of the book. This book show what life is really like. A young man put in a position that had to other posibility but to make him a HERO.
3,Redliners,"Good read nicely pace novel ,with a twist that I enjoyed.The price was great too.The story let us look at combat terrible and and possible solutions."
2,Goes Nowhere,"Maybe this book gets better towards the end, but I could only slog through the first half before giving up. I feel like there is a story in there somewhere, but it gets lost in the half-statements. I almost feel like you have to read this book twice - once to have everything explained, then again to understand all the cryptic statements made before things are explained.The characters are largely interchangeable. I put the book down for a few days, and when I came back, I couldn't tell who was who.I probably would have liked this book if I could figure out what was going on. Since I couldn't, I decided it wasn't worth the frustration to keep going."
3,Not bad,"It started a little weird , but after about the quarter, it started to live up to Drakes standards. Really liked the ending."
3,Fun read,I enjoyed this book from start finish sometimes a little choppy but overall i would recommend this book to anyone who wants a book thats more for fun than ceribial thinking.
3,Salvage,Not the best of David drake but a good solid plot and well developed if you get passed the start. It's the kind of book that is better for me the second time.
2,David Drake left out a plot,"I have read only a few of this author's work, this one was disappointing. In the chapter entitled Into the Fire the redlined troops finally capture a live Kalendru, and they interrogate the alien. We, the readers, learn how .any aliens landed on the planet, how their aircrafts also exploded, how the plant life killed the aliens and other drival. In the next chapter we learn the humans are looking for a ""door"" to an underground chamber that holds the key to ""turning off"" the flora trying to kill everyone. Supposedly the humans got this info during the interrogation. HUH????? This was not in the interrogation!! I am supposing the author slipped up. Then in the last chapter before the epilogue we find many children of the Kalendru are with the humans. Again HUH?? Then then book ends and we have now idea what happened to the colonists. Again HUH?? How are we to rate a book with no apparent ending?"
3,Redliners,All the action you can handle. The plot is a little heady it takes a lot sorting out to get to the purpose and leaves so much unfinished. But it is entertaining and worth the price.
2,Boring,"Very few books do I give up on and quit reading them but Redliners was one of the few. I read approx. 1/3 of it and it seemed like it was stuck in a black hole going no where. I tried, really I tried but just couldn't seem to stand the boredom and finally gave up. Maybe if I had continued to read it might have gained some speed but decided that there are too many good books to read to continue to waste time with this one. Would not even recommend it to the most dedicated sy-fy reader."
4,Redliners,A very entertaining and good book to read a lot of action very likable people. The environment is very creative and twisted.
5,Looking a little deeper.,"I've read and re-read ""Redliners"" so often that the foil on the cover is coming off. Drake makes us take a long hard look at what the men and women in our armed forces sometimes give up to protect us. While being very similar to ""The Jungle"", Drake uses the nightmare trek through the Bezant jungle to show the colonists exactly who and what protects them. A very entertaining read."
3,Repetitive,"It is a decent book. Unfortunately the action is endlessly repetitive. The first few times action is encountered, it is pretty cool and imaginative. Unfortunately it is an absolute slog-fest of the exact same type of action over and - and over - again. The overarching story is weak, which is okay, since the story really is about the journey. But its not okay because the journey is - sorry for saying it again - repetitive (pun intended).I would recommend this book to die hard Drake fans - people who like his Hammer's Slammers might like it - but people looking to start reading military sci-fi should probably look to Dave Weber instead."
4,Active duty PSD,"Excellent tale. Jungle fighting with a twist. The jungle almost wins. Sometimes a little too wordy. Some not too well disguised political overtones. Read some better, some worse. Drake one of the better sci-fi military writers."
4,Vegatables made easy!,"I own a copy of this book which is absolutely in tatters because I use it so much. I would like to order a couple for friends and a new copy for myself because it is a favorite. It is grouped by season, by vegatable and every recipe I've tried ( and I don't think there's but 2 in the book I haven't tried!) is a winner. I have a large garden and often turn to this book when I have a glut of a particular fruit or vegatable. The receipes are for real people faced with the what to cook quick and easy question we face every night. Where else could I find a recipe for everything from spaghetti squash to pesto? I own a ton of cook books but this one has the most down to earth, easy to follow and realistic recipes I've found in a long time. There are very few recipes with odd ball ingredients that you would have to purchase specific for that one dish. Try it! You'll like it!"
2,Hard to unplug,"the items are very hard to get back out of the socket, not that much light is produced. easily breaks."
1,Doesn't even work,I only needed 2 small lights to navigate through our kitchen to our bathroom and thought these would be perfect. I was wrong. One of them was dead! It didn't even turn on for a split second. Don't waste your money.
2,Did I miss something?,"These are pretty weak. They guide you in about the same way the little orange LEDs at the exit to a theater guides you. If you plugged about 50 of these in, you might have enough light to walk around. Otherwise, good luck, you'll just be stubbing your toe while staring at an orange hemisphere. I also don't recommend plugging in 50 for aesthetic reasons."
3,Could Be Little Brighter,"These lights are just bright enough to work well as safety markers after your eyes are fully accustomed to the dark. But if you turn off the normal lighting in the room and immediately try to get around, they will seem hopelessly dim."
2,"Check it out of library, but don't buy it","Though I have read and thoroughly enjoyed other Agatha Raisin mysteries, The Terrible Tourist is really a terrible book. Lots of sad drinking and sad sex, combined with very little plot make this book both boring and discouraging. (You may have murderous thoughts about Agatha before you finish!). If you must read it, check it out from the library. You won't want this one on your shelves."
1,Give it a miss,"Although I've read all the Agatha Raisin books, I'm not a fan. This one is easily the worst of the series. If you want to try M. C. Beaton, read the infinitely superior Hamish Macbeth books."
3,Not As Good as Some of the Others,"I don't think that this book is terrible, but it surely was not nearly as good as some of the others I've read in the series. It is rather disjointed, and even the murders (there are two) seem contrived. The denouement didn't make much sense either. But the biggest disappointment is Agatha's fascination with the odious James. I wish Ms. Beaton would take him out of the storyline actually. I quite enjoyed Sir Charles Firth, and I think he would be a better romantic interest for her than cold and hard James. The setting in Cyprus was interesting. I will continue to read the series, and hopefully we get back to the funny Agatha again. I also want the quaint citizens from her English village in the story."
3,A Rocky Raisin Road Still Delivers,"I tend to agree with those critical of this book, yet for some curious reason (the author's skill, must be) I ended up enjoying it; I wanted to see Agatha hook up with sly Charles. I got hooked on the Raisins from Quiche, and am reading them in order forward, and this was my latest. I love the settings in the Cotswolds,, the author's great humor (including her sly digs at English cuisine, such as it precariously is), Agatha's struggle with middle age and romance, what little there is for her. But here, she comes off as pitiful -- the plotting incredibly unbelievable, chasing after James, the jerk, in so groveling a manner. And that marks the worst bump in the Raisin road for me so far. But, by the end, I found the book quite satisfying, so I read on. I do wonder if I will make it to the end of the series; so far, on balance, M.C. Beaton's prose is deliciously delightful, and something keeps me coming back to her intriguing, warm and humorous world."
4,A Tour of Murder!,"In this 6th book in the Agatha Raisin series, Agatha decides to take a trip to Cyprus to track down one-time fianc', James Lacey, who took off after their disastrous almost marriage. Instead of enjoying a romantic reunion with James, they witness a murder of a fellow tourist. Staying in their rented ""honeymoon"" cottage, Agatha and James work together to solve the murder, but not before the killer strikes again.This book was harder to get into than several of the other in the series. Overall, this series is one of my favorites in the cozy genre, and I was a bit disappointed in this offering. Agatha is portrayed as desperate for James' affections, and although I like her vulnerability, I could easily see why James becomes annoyed with her. With that said, I would still highly recommend this book as a part of the series since it has a decent mystery and an interesting setting.The first book in the series is ""Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death"". Enjoy!"
2,Agatha Raisin and The Terrible Writer(s),"I have read every book by the author ""M.C.Beaton"" and I must say that since rereading ""Agatha Raisin and the Terrible Tourist"" I am more than convinced that M.C.Beaton must be a pseudonym for Multiple Contributors Beat 'em. The writing style of this book is not the same as other Agatha books. This one reads like a travelogue. It also is from a male point of view. The plot is boring,the characters are shallow to the point of stupidity and even the reasoning doesn't fit our Agatha. I've done some research on this author and still feel that the Agatha novels are written either by several contributors or ""the author"" has a split personality! This novel is not even related to the good Agatha stories. If any of you fans out there can clear this up for me, please do."
2,Disappointed,I was hoping that with a change of scene that the relationship between Agatha and James would change. It didn't and now we have Charles who is in and out of the picture. I would hope that Agatha at some point in her relationships would settle for spinsterhood (which she dreads) or throw herself at someone and have more interesting plots.
3,"Amusing, light murder mystery and travelog--worth the money.","I am a male. Nevertheless, I was not annoyed by the relentlessly feminine perspective of the author, who (I presume) resembles her heroine, an English woman pushing fifty. Mrs. Raisin is much less wrinkled and dried up than her name suggests. Unlike a male, she checks out her feelings every minute, and the story is full of ""happily, impatiently, defensively, triumphantly,"" etc. which is (to a male) a bit exasperating at times. In compensation, there are acute observations and amusing characters. There is an extensive travelog component describing touristic experiences in northern Cyprus; I liked this but many would not. Like P. D. James, the author obviously hates men. Bilal, a minor character, is OK, but I suspect that he actually exists and the author concealed her true feelings! (Note the dedication.) Most of the male characters are jerks. The author is probably unmarried."
2,Was disappointed!!!!,"The story line is well explained above so will just commit on my thoughts. I did not enjoy this book as well as the others. Agatha and James move on to Cyprus and leave the friendly place of Carsely. I have come to like the local characters in Carsely and missed them being in the book. The conflict between Agatha and James is beginning to remind me of a ""Soap"" on TV and I don't like that. I also can do without Charles, he is a pain, in my openion. Hopefully Ms. Beaton will move the next book back to Carsely and the people I have come to like."
1,Should I Read It?,"I can't review this book yet as I have not read this one.I read the reviews because I am up to the 6th book and feel I must read it to fnd out what is going to happen with James and Agatha. I left Agatha at the airport, leaving for Cypress.I love the series, however, after reading all the reviews, I am not so keen on reading ""Agatha and the Terrible Tourist"" but I don't want to miss out on any thing so read it I will.I am getting tired of Agatha's obssession with James. I really wish she would get over him already. I find it very painful to read and, at times, annoying.I like Agatha, but do hav a problem with her drinking and her nastiness. I like that she is outspoken, but sometimes she is just plain rude.I love the village, love the characters who live in the village, and I love Agatha's cottage, would love to visit Cotswold.I'll come back after I have read the book, with my opinion."
4,A truly unique find,"Imagine my surprise when I opened the package and found that the left arm is actually a right arm put on backwards! It makes it a truly unique collectible. As far as I am concerned, Richard Harris will always be the only true Dumbledore."
2,"If you like verbal abuse, this is your book!","Pros: The book was short so the assualt on your senses were minimal. The sex scenes were good, if you're into that.Cons: Even though he never physically hit her, the verbal abuse was bad enough. He actually called her a B@#$% more than once! How the hell is that romantic? He treated her like she was someone off the streets but referred to her as his wife in the same breath. He actually called her a ""slut."" They bickered and fought throughout the entire book. At the end, I was left with the feeling that maybe it was better if they stayed apart. His family didn't like her, she didn't like his family and I wonder if they felt anything other than an erotic lust! He was aggressive and high handed, yet the reader is to believe that she just succumbed everytime he touched her? Oh puh-leeze!"
3,Did Amazons Exist?,"That's what this program attempts to discover, although the answer isn't clear. Some tantalizing clues are unearthed, like a 2000-year-old massive burial mound that was used for what seems to be a female warrior/ruler. And amazingly, a DNA link between these remains and a girl now living on the Asian steppes is found. But these are only clues, and not proof, of a band of women warriors. For now, the legend of these warriors remains in the realm of myth, awaiting more discoveries..."
5,Warrior Women,"This movie is a documentary. It stars archaeologist Jeannine Davis-Kimball, who connects ancient remains found in the steppes of Russia to the infamous Amazon tribe. This documentary is actually a companion piece to her book, Warrior Women: An Archaeologist's Search for History's Hidden Heroines. I was so fascinated by the movie that I went to the library to get the book and read it in a day. I learned so much about ancient women and their ability to kick some serious butt. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to learn more about women's history."
4,Outstanding,"I remember this well, this was when MMA was still being called the term NHB(No-Holds-Barred) and examines fights around the world. You see glimpses of true Vale Tudo in Brazil, where headbutts, knees and elbows really don't have the rulings and restrictions held in UFC and Pride, and is closest to a street fight as there are no gloves. This is the highlight if you can't seem to find fights from Brazil.Fights around the world here in bare knuckle MMA, showed the interviews of each fighters mentality in the ring/cage, and their backgrounds.You'll see originators here, Frank Shamrock, Enson Inoue, Randy Couture, Kevin Randleman.It's a look into early MMA, the views before UFC blew up onto basic cable reruns, and is violent in examining the growing pains. You can tell these were the early years as today most professional fighters are very well balanced in all aspects."
4,A fun book.,"I read this book years ago and am still waiting for the next two! This is a really cute book, I like the characters, it moves along well and the heroine isn't an idiot. She seems like a normal teenager. Many teen books are too sickly sweet but this one is not. It is fun to read and I hope there are more to come in this series."
5,2 1GB sticks,"I upgraded from 1GB to 2GB using this 2-pack of ddr2 RAM. this is what my mother board required. now windows vista with a dual core processor (~2GHz ea) boots up in 30 seconds, & shuts down in about 15 seconds. very happy customer."
4,Great Deal,This is not the fastest RAM on the market by any means. Although it's inexpensive and it's Corsair so it is good quality.
2,Corsair PC2-42oo 533MHz Memory,"I purchased this item for my Dell Dimension desktop. The specs said the memory were compatible with this computer, but upon installing, the computer would not turn on. After several tries, I gave up and returned the product to Amazon.com. Throughout the transactions, I received good and fast service: Amazon.com even refunded my money before they received my returned goods. In this respect, the experience is still a good one."
3,In stock - NOT,"Been waiting for this to ship for over a month even though it says ""IN STOCK"". Price has changed twice, which is fine by me, but I've had to approve the order twice because of delays in shipment."
3,Didn't fit older dell,These did not work in the Dell they were ordered for but I had another model that needed memory and they worked fine.
1,defective RAM module,"Delivery was quick and installation was a snap. I increased my work computer's memory from 1 GB to 3 GB and saw a great increase in speed and multitasking ability. But a week later I started to get random crashes - most often when using Firefox, and next most often when using an accounting program. A week later the crashes, errors and random reboots became intolerable. A system diagnostic identified the problem as the RAM. One of the modules is defective (can't tell which one because they have to be installed in pairs).Hopefully I can return them - I no longer have the original blister pack they came in. ..."
4,Good overall,"Upon initial order of memory, it was the wrong memory even though it said 533MHz PC2 4200 on the labeling - it just did not fit. I had to call NEMIX and explain the problem. I had to send them back the memory at my cost :-( They did end up correcting the problem and sent the correct size. It fits and my desktop is running faster now."
4,It works,"It works the way it's supposed too. The packaging was a little torn up, but the items were in quality condition."
1,waste of money break_n_mend,"I have used tools all my life in farming,carn truck repair and oilfeild worst tool I have ever bought yet to break one chain succesfullly with it"
2,Unthreatening but pandering,"It's easy to understand Moody's appeal. His short fiction offers facile experimentalism with a commercial gloss. His idea of innovation is to go a little crazy with italics in unexpected places. Readers feel flattered, unthreatened. Moody is a ""safe"" writer--he'll never take you any place that might unsettle you. The occasional comparisons to Cheever and Updike are especially troubling, because as a stylist Moody has few discernible gifts other than the colloquial crispness one associates with overexcited magazine features. Moody is not a major writer. That he is mistaken for one, and promoted as one, and accepted as one, says a lot about the decline of literary fiction in this country."
3,Mixed bag,"Overall, I enjoyed Demonology much less than Ice Storm and Purple America. There is a prevailing sense that Mr. Moody is trying too hard to be clever -- word choice, annoyingly excessive use of italics, even the structure of some of the stories -- seem too deliberate. There is also some seemingly graitious ""shock"" content, the stuff that's better left to the likes of Bret Easton Ellis, who does it much better. That being said, there are a couple of real gems in here, and it's worth sticking it out as Moody saves the best for last...the title story is a wonderful example of what exceptional short stories should be."
2,Another overextended talent,"This book is depressingly mechanical in its technique and effects. It's not as bad as some of the other customers here have noted. It's not as if the guy has no talent. It's just that there's nothing remarkable about the talent. There's nothing original, nothing striking. He's earnest, sure, and that should count for something. But he's also trivial. This is a book of trifles. It's a book you can read fast--even skim--with full assurance that you're not missing anything. We have already had enough such books."
4,An incredibly beautiful story collection...,"I must admit that I'm not a fan of Rick Moody's novels (Ice Storm, Purple America, and Garden State all nearly put me to sleep), but when it comes to short stories, man, there's no one better (aside from Lydia Davis and Ray Carver, mind you). He's constantly creative, his stories are filled with an innovative simplicity that's quite remarkable. Most notable is the story ""Boys,"" which, in seven short pages, follows two brothers from childhood to adulthood. This is great stuff..."
1,A Disappointment,"These pieces tend to be stunts rather than stories. If you're a reader looking for more than cleverness, you're probably better off passing on this collection. Moody has never been strong on craftsmanship and tunefulness, but some of the lapses and bum notes this time out are pretty startling."
4,why the gimmickry ? O/W recommended.,"A strong collection that shows what readers of Moody's novel The Ice Storm already know : This guy can write. His ability to get inside his character's minds is to be admired.One reason for 4 - not 5 stars though. I found the ... of Moody to italize in the middle of a thought to be distracting. Why does an otherwise gifted writer feel the need to be bigger than the form he uses ? Did not using such a gimmick limit any of the great writers ? With that one small critque in mind, I still highly urge you to explore this book."
4,Overall a good read,"I really enjoyed The Chicken Mask. I think it was the strongest of the collection. I think this was a good, diverse collection and I would recommend to many of my friends."
1,Save Your Money,I've never been a fan of Rick Moody. I find his work pretentious and without emotion and this collection of short stories was no different. Definitely over-rated.
2,enough with those italics,"Despite a cool title and gorgeous cover, this book falls short once you open it up. The italics for one. They're the literary equivalent of someone whispering in your ear when you're trying to watch on a movie, they jolt you from your absorption and leave you unsure of what is going on.Second, this collection is very uneven. A few stories are very good, several are passable, and many are downright infuriating to try and grasp the point of. I don't believe ""literary fiction"" has to wear its incomprehensibility and pretentiousness like a badge of honor, in order to garner admiration.Thirdly, the characters have little to no depth, with the exception of a few narrators. We get their physical descriptions, what music they like, and where they shop, yet nothing about what they believe in, what they enjoy doing in their spare time, their political stands, etc. Brand names do not a multi-dimensional character make.My recommendation: Skip it."
3,Don't believe the hype ...,"I'm not saying Rick Moody is a bad writer. He can shift between social classes and write them all well. He has all the stylistic and linguistic pyrotechnics. He is intelligent, and is trying to deal with more than just ideas.But this collection lacks true emotional depth. Loss never transcends into grief, insecurity does not go to neurosis, love is never passion. It's small emotions that define this book, and I feel that the more experimental and language-intensive the work is, the more emotional substance needs to be there to support the structure. It's as if he has the same candy coating as Eggers and Wallace, but without the chewy center of hard-to-handle truth.I liked enough of the style to keep an eye out for future work, but can't recommend this collection as anything outstanding."
