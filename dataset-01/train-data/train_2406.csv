5,Watering the seeds of peace and loving-kindness,A wonderful meditation tape for those practitioners familiar with Thich Nhat Hanh's teachings. The guided meditations are an ideal support for daily meditation practice that grow more fruitful each time you return to them. Highly Recommended.
5,"So many of these CDs disappoint, but not this one.","It's hard to buy these online, because one's responses to these CDs are so personal. I strongly dislike most of the ones I've purchased.Not this one. The beautifully simple sound of the gong, slowly, very slowly, repeated, is just ideal for meditating for those of us who need a little audio help.Wonderful!"
1,Leg broke within seconds,This is the second Hawk Man of this style and typewe have purchased. The legs fell off both of them immdiately after opening the package.
4,"Very good, but a bit scattered","An excellent introduction to periodized training, with some good examples. I have to think there was supposed to be some sort of greater organization to the content than there seems to be, but it is still a pretty good read and reference for those who want to take their bike-specific training to the next level."
5,Something for Every Cyclist,"""The Ultimate Ride"" provides not only cycling and fitness information for the elite rider, but also for the weekend enthusiast who wants to make the most of his skill. I found the book exceptionally well organized and clearly useful. It is unfortunate that ""reviews"" are posted which seek to discredit the author by someone who most likely has not read the book nor can spell the author's name correctly. I would hope anyone who wants an honest review will rely on accurate sources."
3,"Plenty of useful info, but....","....you need to be willing to extract the info and build a program on your own, one that fits YOU.I think Chris has been working with pros for so long he's forgotten what it's like to be a fat, slow old guy. This book is not aimed at mere mortals.When he was talking about setting up for a sprint, he said something about ""getting up to 30mph before going into the sprint"". I put the book down and thought ""3O? 30 BEFORE you start to sprint? I can't do 30, downhill, with an anvil strapped to my ass!""BUT, I've used the workouts as templates for routines that fit ME. If you're willing to do that, there is some good info in this book."
4,"Better than ""Lance Armstrong Performance Program""","Chris Carmichael did a better job in this book than ""Lance Armstrong Performance Program"". I think that ""The Ultimate Ride"" has more details, and does not use the ""maximum heart rate"" padron of training, but ""lactate threshold"", as found in Joe Friel's ""The Cyclist Training Bible"".However, its much easier to create an anual program with ""The Cyclist Training Bible"", since the ""The Ultimate Ride"" is a little bit haphazard in this issue.The best book of bike training still is ""The Cyclist Training Bible""; ""The Ultimate Ride"" is the second best."
5,If you ride and you're serious - buy it,"Excellent book for the serious rider, even after you stop being a serious rider. Good training advice, food advice, dietary recommendations, menus for exceptional meals. Carmichael is the guru when it comes to training serious cyclists and this is obvious as you read the book. I've referred to it numerous times even after i stopped competing and training at a serious level and I think I'll pull a menu out for a meal during the coming week."
4,"Part Infomercial, Part Genius","About 40% of this book presents the best written summary that I have seen on bicycling-related nutrition, physiology, tactics, and training. The other 60% is an infomercial for the Carmichael Training System (CTS). The book presents its information in a very redundant fashion, frequently repeating the same points over and over. For season veterans of bicycling who read a lot, you won't find too many new revelations to justify purchasing the book, however, the few that you do find may make it worth it. For those who are newer to the sport and who want to improve, I'd recommend this book. The best parts of this book are easy to read and have invaluable information. Skim the other 60% unless you want to pay for CTS coaching and need to understand more about it."
3,Good but Friel is MUCH better,"I wish that I had read D. Snell's review before buying. After reading The Ultimate Ride, I learned about the The Cyclist's Training Bible by Joe Friel from my local bike club. I agree wholeheartedly with D. Snell's comments. The Ultimate Ride is good, but it is Friel-Lite and lacks a lot of details found in Friel that are helpful in putting together your own periodization training plan."
2,"should have been called ""The History of Forensic Entomology""","The title of this book was misleading. Over 130 pages of entomology! Very dry and boring, and I am studying forensic toxicology. Not sure why she wrote this as it is not a text book and is not a fun read."
4,Interesting Overview of Specific Forensic Practices,"Often expectations make or break an experience. In the case of Corpse, I had expected a more general discussion of forensic methodologies and the usual case-study method (similar to those books by well-known pathologists). This book, however, focuses its attention mostly on ""Bugs,"" and to a significantly smaller extent anthropology and botany. The history of the development of each specialty was interesting and the ""no-holds-barred"" approach to the results of decay was well-handled. While the book was not as ""light"" as I had originally expected, it was an informative and entertaining read."
5,"Life After Death, A Detective's Tool","Whether you enjoy a good murder mystery on occaision, or prefer watching a nature program on the Discovery Channel, you might well enjoy Corpse, as I did. The author places the new discipline of forensic ecology in a 2,000+ year historical perspective around the struggle to determine time of death. It aroused my interests in everything from history, evolution and nature to creative deductive reasoning. The sensational aspects of the discipline's application only add to its appeal, while the author's light touch makes for a fast read and humorous--but respectful--treatment of the subject matter."
2,THIS IS A COVER BAND - NOT THE ORIGINAL ARTIST VERSIONS,"This is a band called Award Winning Country who does cover versions of the songs listed. Not the original artists performing. Funny how neither Amazon.com or the artist bothers to mention that on the listing. They do a good job, but it's not the origional version."
1,"Bootleg, don't buy","It's a Chinese bootleg that used TV-cap as the video source. You can see the SBS broadcast logo in the right-hand corner, and there is Korean news text scrolling at the bottom. The English subtitles aren't good either. Avoid..."
2,"Educational, but watch out...","If you want to learn more about Japan, this video series can be a good way to start. There's lots of scenic footage that gives you a glimpse into the country and its rich history, arts, traditions, and customs.That being said, this series has several drawbacks:1) While the publishing date says 1991, it seems that much of the footage is from the mid-80s, and seems dated at times.2) There is a two-minute scene with female nudity when they are explaining bathhouses. This and the shots of violent and sexually-explicit comic book pages make viewing at times inappropriate for children or students.3) There is a definite Western slant in the dialogue that seems to reinforce - not cut through - the stereotypes about Japan and its people. I have lived in Japan for three years, and while generalizations can at times be helpful, there comes a time when you must look beyond stereotypes or you risk offending someone."
4,This book gave me HOPE!!,"I was fairly new to Environmental Illness and living in constant fear when I discovered this book. It was a ray of hope to me in a desperate time! I was familiar with the idea of the mind-body connection, but this was the first book I read that applied it to E.I.It was so refreshing for me to read the story of an ordinary woman who overcame her demons (and admitted to doing so imperfectly) instead of being preached to by some mind-body guru who never actually experienced the illness. The author is just an average person sharing her experience. I related to just about all of the fears and emotional issues she described, and my copy of this book quickly became marked up with underlines and asteriks! I felt as though the book were written just for me."
2,Slow response from seller,"I use Amazon alot and never have a problem. However, this time I was contacted by them that they had no response from the seller and provided an email address for him. I emailed him with no response on the first try. I emailed him again and he provided me with his phone number. I called him and finally got through to him what he needed to do to complete this purchase. I received this item a week later than it should have taken."
5,Excellent behind-the-scenes look into the BEST of Ice Shows,"This book was not very expensive in my opinion. Around $20.00, and WELL worth it. The photos are fabulous! Hienz Kluetmeir is a genius with the camera, and many of his famous shots are in the book. It is a VERY good behind-the-scenes look at how this incredible show got started, how it is put together, how difficult the training, and organization is, and how close all of the skaters and crew are. It really IS a big family. There is a WHOLE entire chapter devoted to Gordeeva and Grinkov, and many photos of them, as well as Katia solo, and some of Dasha too. There also is a whole chapter on Scott...the ""Father"" of the show. Great content. Great photos. Great read. On a skating scale I give it a 9.9 !!! (.01 deduction for not having a photo of G&G on the front or back covers.) :o) LOL!!"
3,"did not reach potential, but not bad either","First, as in nearly all figure skating books these days, the photography is excellent. The photographs will make the reader rush out and buy tickets to Stars on Ice. The chapter about the tragic death of Sergei Grinkov is as moving as one would expect. However, the family feeling of Stars on Ice did not shine through out the entire book. In most chapters it was a shallow, superficial coverage of this unique tour. It could have been so much more."
5,great children's music,I loaded the songs into my iPod and am playing it often via a bluetooth speaker. My baby seems to enjoy them quite a bit.
3,I did not receive the product,"I did not receive the products I ordered. The products were delivered during Christmas time. I was not at the business at the time. I don't know whom it delivered to. i was going to ask you about this. I could not find your phone number. Please help me look into this.Thanks,Taiyong Cao"
5,Lighten up and have fun!!!,"This show is adventerous and fun, it's new and fresh. And first and foremost it's a cartoon show for cryin' out loud. The previous reviews are harsh and insultful. I find this show very funny and I, for one, adore their music. The above reviewers sound as if they are the same ones that would like cartoons like Tom & Jerry removed form the air for being 'too violent'. Hey everyone, it's great that opinions can be shared and expressed, and my opinion is this show rocks! I also love the girls' 'indie rock' sound. This show is a keeper, right up there with the likes of Billy & Mandy and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends."
1,"Comments To Jessie ""304""","FINALLY! I'm not the only one here against this absolutely dreadful TV series. It shows only how much of jerks people can be. I mean, Taz never changes being the rude and greedy idiot while the two ""stars"" either need to insult someone, hurt someone, or play crap that they call music."
4,Great album,I really like this album. Full of catchy songs that you can listen to over and over again.
5,and here there go again....,"Here they go again with a 5-star cd, in my opinion!!There are a mixture of songs on here... more popish ones and of course some ballads!Go get this CD!!!!!!"
3,A little disappointed,Only about 2 songs I really enjoyed. I am relatively new in the Country Western scene. Got tired of rock. Most of Rascals songs reminded me of rock.
4,Crossed Over,"I've lived in Texas for 30 years, but have retained my taste for Rock n Roll. After seeing Rascal Flats on Letterman I decided to check out the CD only to find it already #1 on the crossover charts.I agree. It's a good step in the CW direction. And a Damn Good CD."
2,Lyric quality not up to par,"I'm a die-hard Rascal Flatts fan--only group I've ever bought every CD and waited for months for new ones to come out. I really only LOVED two or three songs on this one. Their vocals are great but IMHO many of the songs are really lacking in quality of lyrics--pretty hokey. I'm somewhat disappointed with this CD compared to previous ones. No real standout songs, although a few enjoyable ones. I agree with the reviewer who said ""She Goes all the Way"" is a bit too racey. Beautiful song, but sends the wrong message to the younger crowd."
2,Just OK,"I have always been a fan of RF, and I think this is certainly their worst CD. It has a couple of enjoyable tunes (Secret Smile, Take Me There is OK), but mostly the lyrics and music are unoriginal and boring. I found nothing ""poignant"" about any of the lyrics as I've heard others say. Bob That Head particularly irritates me as one of the stupidest songs I've ever heard. Looking back, I wish I would have saved my money and just bought Secret Smile on iTunes."
3,Good C.D. - BAD SELLER,"I did not mind a ""like new"" C.D. that skipped on 2 songs, but when I e-mailed the seller and it has been over 2 weeks and no response, that pretty much dictates I will avoid this seller in the future and would suggest the same to anyone thinking about it."
5,A great CD!!,"I love this CD. It really shows a different side. I got to meet them in person, and they are the nicest trio I have ever met."
4,Pretty good CD,I don't feel like this Rascal Flatts CD is as good as some of their past CD's but it is still VERY GOOD! If you are a Rascal Flatts fan you will love it and if you are not it just might make you a fan!
2,Very Poorly Written,"This book is very poorly written. There are a number of flash backs that if my teacher hadn't pointed out, no one would have that it was a flash back. The ending is also terrible. Only read this book if you have to much time on your hands."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","This book was okay. It was a first draft, and therefore it wasn't edited. I thought that it was historically accurate, and I liked the book up until the ending for its detail, imagery, and language. There was no correlation between the ending and the story, however. You can't skip about 4 - 8 years, and show a guy completely pro-Mexican and anti-gringo suddenly change into a man that lives with those he once hated, and scorns that which he once loved so much. That may be how the story in real life would have ended, but I personally don't like the idea of filling in all the details. I would have preferred to read an extra 100 - 200 pages to find out how Gualinto became who he became. Although I was disappointed in the last 20 pages, I was impressed by the 280 preceding it, so I gave the book 3 stars."
4,George Washington Gomez by Americo Paredes,"Americo Pardes is a wonderful author. He also writes poems.George Washington Gomez is a depressing book. It's depressing because Gumersindo Gomez died, at the beginning. It shows great leadership towards, fighting for what is right it also gives you confidences for standing up for your goals.The Texans Mexicans showed that everyone struggles, and that everyone isn't easy.One struggle was crossing the Rio Grande Valley. Gualinto needed to provide for his family, since Gumersindo past away.George Washington Gomez is a racial masterpiece, towards Mexicans (Latinos).Which I believe is cruel, and mistaken killing innocents isn't the way to go. For example The killing of Gumersindo didn't have a caused at all. Texas Ranger needed to look back, and realized that people do have families, to provide for. I also believe everyone wants a safe future. I suggested you to read George W. Gomez."
4,7 yr old daughter loves it.,"It fits my 7 yr old, but it's a little big around the neck area, so she will have to wear a t-shirt underneath. The head band is also a tiny bit loose (surprising since she has a big head for her age), but easy to sew tighter. One string of beads came loose (and beads were lost) during the first day that she wore it, they are connected with a thin thread so not sure if others will break off or if she just caught it on something while playing. The costume still looks fine though. The material is fairly thin but not see through. All and all I am please but think it should sell for about $18. Also note from customer images that there is NO blue border around the collar as depicted in the photo, it's actually a blood red and the feather is a bright red."
5,Indian costume,This costume completely met my expectations. I needed a costume for my 9 year old as she was Pochantas in a school presentation. It was good quality and looked great.
2,Poor Quality,Very thin fabric and poorly made. The seams on this dress were missed in several places and I ended up sewing and sewing. I should have just made a costume myself as I practically did in the end anyway. I would not recommend purchasing this product.
4,Little Princess Takes on the Cowboys,"My daughter lets her friends use this outfit. There is another similar outfit ""Little Pow-wow Indian Girl"" that is a bit cuter, and she usually wears herself. But it would be so boring to have two of the same outfit. It is sturdy, and would make it past Halloween into the dress up closet."
5,"Very good costume, fantastic for the price","Among a sea of competing Native American girl costumes, we chose this one for my daughter's Pocahantas presentation based on others' reviews.I was actually a little sceptical of the price being fairly low and our timeline being tight, but in the end was rewarded for taking the risk on both fronts.The costume iteslf is great. I can't comment on the design's social and historical accuracy, but it is far more detailed and durable than I expected, the size was as described, and overall it's a great bargain. Delivery was surprisingly fast too, arriving two days earlier than promised."
3,Pretty Costume Designed for Minimal Use,"This costume was purchased for Halloween use. My daughter wore it for a Fall Dance at her school. The beading and fringe were the envy of her kindergarten group. However, I realized exactly how thin the material was under the strobe lights. The designs on her panties were completely visible! On Halloween evening, I compensated for the material by having her wear leggings. The beading began to unravel/break after 20 min."
5,a labor of love & inspiration!,"Truly a labor of love from all the contributors who live in & around Port Townsend on the Quimper Peninsula at the mouth of the Puget Sound, in the State of Washington, Elisabeth Rochford Haight & Sylvia Platt have done an admirable job of editing this extra-ordinary collection of reflections & observations on mothering.I thought I could list my five favorite entries, & found I could not, because each one, be it a poem, a painting, a story haunts my heart, & fills my mind with my own memories about my mother & my time as a mother.MAMA STEW is to be savored, quietly in your favorite place to read a book. Each entry is richly textured with emotions, memories & everyday philosophy, that verges on elation.Very well done!"
5,Wow!!!,"I started sending out my bands demo a couple days before I got this album in the mail. It's intimidating to hear a couple of new guys that recorded at the house (much like I have) and they sound this good. I can't believe they're not bigger than they are. It's not just [good] music, its deep, highly creative, and catchy as hell. Some bands do something and you say ""Wow, I know where your coming from!!"" But with these guys your saying ""Wow, I wish I knew where you were coming from!!"" I bought this album because of the MBV comparisons, and I kept hearing the beatles mentioned and you do kind of get the sense of Kevin Shields doing Sgt. Peppers, but this album is by no means a rehash of anything I've ever heard. I gotta check out their next release!"
2,Robin Actio Figure,"This Robin figure was not worth the money, it was so small, I can't believe I paid that much money for it!!!!"
5,Loved this movie,"I remember hearing about this move years ago and finally got around to buying it a couple years back (writing this review not having watched it in maybe seven years). Great flick and one of my favorite jap flicks of all time, especially the guy with the rock. All these years later I can still visualize almost the entire movie in my head which is always a sign of great movie."
2,....,"I'm a big Miike fan, but I must admit, Visitor Q left me unimpressed and a bit sick of this attempt to push or cross the line while illustrating a moral.I loved this film for it's exposure of elements..true elements of what seems to be the downfall of the Japanese (and even Western) family life/structure. Most elements of the family's disfunction were either taken strait from the Japanese newspapers or bore incredible similarity, but, the genius of that was lost when every thing from incest, fulls scenes showing middle-aged lactating, scatology, necrophilia, domestic abuse and murder were featured in an almost pornographic-like manner.This was Miike showing off and patting himself on the back while doing it. Sadly, it really is, or could be, a great story, but the story itself seemed to much to be a means of holding graphic scene of every taboo together."
3,Two hours of trying to shock you,"I watched Visitor Q out of morbid curiousity. I love off-beat movies, but I was a little let down here. To say that the acting was poor is being generous, and the plot can become predictable by simply asking yourself, ""What is the most hideous thing this character can now do?"" It seems that this movie was made for the sole purpose of shocking us. This movie wont move you because you wont care about any of the characters. Let's just say it's best to watch this movie while your drunk with you buddies... Oh yeah... women BEWARE - you will HATE it! All that having been said, I'm glad I experienced this work to laugh about it with my movie afficianato pals."
1,Total trash,How can anyone watch this? Surely only the most braindead people would want to see it. Too cruel to be funny and too cheap and trashy to be considered art. Maybe the audience for this is the same one for Jackass. Those people think a bottle rocket up the [...] is funny. I'm not a prude either but this is garbage. If you want to see a great Takashi Miike film - see Audition. That was a work of art and scary as hell.
1,waste of time,This movie(if we can call it that)was the biggest waste of a disc that I have ever seen.Besides being disturbing and discusting the movie makes no sense what so ever.I think I would rather have a root canal or spend the night in a Turkish prison then have to suffer watching this piece of trash again.Dont waste your money or time with this one.
1,Don't Buy This Product,"I say not to buy this out of no disrepect for the film, but because i recently bought this very copy from Amazon and the movie was NOT ON THE DVD! It was just a compilation of Japanese previews. If you want to get the movie, by all means, its absolutely outrageous, but get it from somewhwere else."
1,Takashi Miike AT HIS WORST,This movie was Garbage...I though Vistor Q was going to be great but instead I got garbage...Its stupid and yet disturbing...Trash....Very bad...THis movies plot was just as stupid as the film...DO NOT GET THIS FILM!!!-0000000/5 stars
5,Great,"I really liked this movie and it is a crazy one. Takashi Miike is a excellent director and I feel this is one of his better ones. I enjoy movies that shock ,surprise and entertain you all the way through. I have 36 Takashi Miike movies in my collection so far and I'm trying to add more. I would recommend this to any Miike fan and I even think it's a good start for new fans."
2,Not Impressed,"I've been torturing my copy of Audition for years and finally decided to check out the ""legendary"" VisitorQ. Foreign, Artsy, Disturbing, etc? Fine. VistorQ? Garbage! A standard story hidden beneath shallow shock and awe that's preoccupied with hiding the films lack of depth. This movie did not disturb me. I've seen worse. I'm not trashing it because of the incest, milk, murder, necrophilia, etc. It's just not a good movie. Two stars instead of 1 because I can barely see what this movie was trying to do. It just fails horribly."
3,Still in shock!,"This is one sick movie, but the director is proving a positive point in a very negative light. Good for at least one view."
3,Not your every day movie,"I am not sure what to make of this movie and I cannot decide what it is about either. There is the modern/future dysfunctional family, incest, reality TV, school, addiction, violence, and nurturing all in one outrageously bizarre but somehow funny movie.This is not a movie for everyone because it takes topics like incest and obsession to the extreme. There are sexually-explicit scenes and weird scenes that make you feel guilty for laughing.The director uses exaggeration and shock to make his point but even in those moments he adds his twisted humor that would make you laugh in the oddest moments.This is as real as it gets (so far) to portraying the dysfunctional society in its raw and shocking state but a dysfunctional family is shocking after all so why not portray it as it is.It is one of these movies that would make you go ""what?!"" and then try to figure out an answer to that.A good movie to watch but approach it with patience and a very open mind."
1,The Worst movie I've ever seen,"I must say, Takashi Miike; the director of this film is a very disturbed individual. I feel like this was made only to shock and disgust people. other than that, there's absolutely nothing to it. From a Japanese female point of view, I was very offended and disgusted by the story. This film is SICK - I would not recommend it."
2,Enough Already!,"You know what would shock me?A ""nice"" Japaneese film...a film with a bit of warmth and humanity to it...Hell, a romance, that would be mad!These are just getting teadious...Ichi the blah blah blah, enough!!!These Japaneese movies movies are like Japaneese food, very beautiful to look at and amazingly technically put together....but Japan has the highest rate of bowel cancer in the world.Know what I mean?"
1,NO STARS!!!,"Takashi Miike should be serving time for his films. Plain and simple.Yeah, I should've known what I was getting into after Audition & Ichi the Killer. This one takes the cake though. If you want to be a lesser human being, by all means watch, rent and/or buy this movie. Otherwise, I'd stay far, far away from it."
2,Not Takashi's best...Stick to AUDITION,This film was a bit too twisted and sick for me but I still managed to watch it in one piece. This film was just a pure crap and had some really unnecisary scenes and is just as bad as the unholy overrated Ichi the Killer. If you want to see a good Tkashi Miike film watch Audition...Forget this crap..2.1 out of 5 stars..Lates
2,sorry but this is funny......,"While this movie trys to raise the bar in shock and awe it really isn't easy to take this movie serious its like a george carlin skit, he is talkin about serious matters but all in all its still damn funny.The sad part is i am not even sure what this movie is about the plot goes nowhere the sences of violence look like they are from monty python its just a silly movie and how anyone can give this movie more than 2 stars is beyond me, maybe i am missin somthin.... but if you want real takashi go with audition or ichi the killer...."
4,WTF Squared,"This is a film that defies categorization... it's so out there and odd that it really stands on its own as a unique type of viewing experience. You'll be shocked, you'll laugh, and you'll say ""WTF"" a lot. I thoroughly enjoyed it... and I wish more movies just went for it like this one does. If you do rent it... stick with it... it gets progressively more and more bizzare as it goes on; and you'll find that its so odd, it almost become satirical and you'll find yourself laughing at how far they are taking some of the ideas.If you are the type of person that enjoys stuff off the beaten path, then check this movie out and get ready for a head trip. Fun watch..."
4,Visitor Q,"I honeslty did not know who Q was until near the end of the film, which in my case was really sad but sue me. This film is about a guy who enters the life of a family and helps them become happy and sane. There is a lot of strange stuff in the film, especially with the long twisted sex scene opening. I know it might seem sick, but I couldn't help but laught during one of the scenes of the son beating his mother. It was just too darn ridiculous. The whole family got issues but Q helps solve everything with little effort it seemed. Visitor Q is not for everyone for sure but it's a really good dark film with some humor here and there. Worth cheking out."
4,Listings to many chains plus take out entrees.,"This is a nice informative book. Only trouble is how the listings are arranged and the fact that some of the foods available at the chain restaurants were omitted. An index, would have helped out tremendously. All in all though, the listings for the foods are fairly extensive. I guess the book would have been enormous as well as quite costly if every food available at the chain restaurants was included. I was able to find the approximate caloric content of many Chinese foods plus alchohol beverages. It was a pleasant surprise to be able to have info such as this, in the book. :-)"
4,...different...,"I bought this because it was recommended along with a Nightwish album, so I figured it would at least be decent. Well, it's different. I'm not crazy about it, but it sure as hell isn't trash. The instruentals are great, but I hate to say, Kemi Vita is a horrible vocalist. She sounds okay when her vocals get drowned out by the guitars. I would've liked a few heavier songs, but it's all good."
3,Swatch Blue Bean,"I new the minute I saw it I had to had to have it. I am a fan of blue, so that was the eye catcher. The price wasn't bad either. After I got it 'hooked up' and set it to working with my own message, I was thrilled. I had previously had a machine for about 10 yrs., so when it 'died' Amazon was the only place for me esp. being on the net. Anyway, it seemed to be working fine, until I tried to replay the important message I had, to my disappointment it wouldn't do that. Then I ran into the problem of not being able to hear the messages very loudly. But over all it ain't so bad."
3,"Reliable, but poorly designed","I've had mine for about 5 months. It serves me reliably, but I've cursed at it a number of times because I think its user interface (e.g. what happens when you press the buttons, and how do you do a certain simple operation) was very poorly designed. It just takes me much longer to do what I have to with this machine than with another digital answering machine I've worked with. For example, to listen to old archived messages, one has to push the ""play"" button and hold.... it.... down.... for... @#!... eaons.... OK 3 seconds, but much, much too long for something this simple."
1,Total Waste of Money.,"Wish I had a zero star option.I got the first one shipped and the battery compartmentscrew had a blunt head. Returned it for a new one.Volume control know kept having loose contact and wouldbreak the voice, and had to keep jiggling it.Finally, after 3 months, One day, went dead. No CPRnothing would help. I thought I should give a newbiea try. I am going back to panasonic and the sony's. I knowthey may have issues, or a hickup here and there. But togo totally dead on you.I am amazed Amazon carries this Piece of S***.Save yourself the trouble. Ditch it.Sun"
1,Oh No!,"This product was a huge disappointment. The seller sent me two, paid for one. Not sure why they did that. The best thing about the product is that it came with a prerecorded British voice. But using it was nightmare. Which is why one quickly went in the trash and the new one was regifted to some unsuspecting soul."
1,Beauty is only skin deep,"Ok..so my husband bought this thing because I have the cute little blue swatch phone that goes with it. We unpacked this thing and I tried to set it up. Let me just say, I am a software engineer and I couldn't get this darned thing to work. I tried EVERYTHING. It is supposed to be easy. It looks easy. It even sounds easy (when you can decipher what the automated voice is saying to you) but the darned thing wouldn't record messages. I tried several lines and even brought the thing into my office to try there. No luck. SO...if you buy this, beware. The one you get might not work. I suspect I got a bum one, but I was pretty disgruntled with it and its tech staff."
1,Cute but malfunctioning...,"Not reliable - stopped recording after just a couple of months of usage, poor sound quality."
1,Swatch Need to Work on its Quality Control,"Good points: 1. General Product is compact, sleek, and attractive. Has every feature one could want. It was easy to set up, has remote control features, and was operational within 10 minutes. 2. Product comes with a 9-volt battery included. 3. Battery reportedly saves not only time/date but also all recorded messages. Bad points: 1. Product that I received had a manufacturing defect -- the ""next message"" button did not work. This button is also used to set the date and time, as well as the PIN code for remote operation. Had to deal without use of those features. 2. To install the battery, need a phillips screwdriver. A ""no tools needed"" approach would have been better. 3. Had a hard time installing the battery -- battery cover would not close unless extra force was applied. The manufacturer just did not design enough room for the battery and connecting wire."
3,Swatch Blue Bean,"I new the minute I saw it I had to had to have it. I am a fan of blue, so that was the eye catcher. The price wasn't bad either. After I got it 'hooked up' and set it to working with my own message, I was thrilled. I had previously had a Radio Shack machine for about 10 yrs., so when it 'died' Amazon was the only place for me esp. being on the net. Anyway, it seemed to be working fine, until I tried to replay the important message I had, to my disappointment it wouldn't do that. Then I ran into the problem of not being able to hear the messages very loudly. But over all it ain't so bad."
1,"Pretty, but junk.","I was in the market for a new message machine, since my 1990 AT&T tape machine broke. Sound quality, above all, was the most important quality for me. I scoured the web for something that would get the job done -- the Blue Bean seemed to fit the bill. Not so. I am appauled with the sound quality. It is very bad. Both the outgoing and incoming messages are muddy. Don't confuse volume for clarity. The volume can reach high levels, which is nice. However, because the messages are so muddy, it is very difficult to hear what is being said, despite playing it at a high volume. I can't believe that some company can't manufacture a DIGITAL answering machine that is high quality, and sounds as good, or better than a tape machine. I'm willing to pay for one if it exists. Sadly, the Blue Bean is not that machine, and I CANNOT recommend it to anyone."
1,Looks Great but Does it work?,"This answering machine has two great advantages over alot of other ones: it is cute and it is small. Unfortunately the good news ends there.Answering machines have to do two things: record messages and play them back. This one does record messages and it does play them back -- at least I think that is what it recorded. The sound quality is so bad the messages are almost impossible to decipher. After 6 months of wanting to rip it from the wall, I finally did just that and tossed it in the garbage. I replaced it with an AT&T version and I couldn't be happier. If it is cute you want, cut out the picture and hang it over your phone. It'll work about as well as the real item."
4,Delightful and Fresh !!,"Great sounding presentation! It is, after all, Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Yes, Most Vivaldi sounds the same, but this is why you load a player or computer for hours so you can study, relax, or forget without having to analyze the music. If you want to go through audible mentation listen to Tartini or Paganini. Vivaldi seems surfeit with his orchestration in most of his works. In some ways there really is no better than Vivaldi, but others can equal. Vivaldi is a standard by which others may compare. I got this 2 cd set for less than $7.00, what a great deal!! (search the web)God Day Friends !!"
3,Pretty Good,"I grew up listening to Rudolph Serkin play these pieces. He will always be the gold standard on Mozart piano concertos as far as I'm concerned. I gave this album 3 stars instead of 4 solely for Ashkenazy's weak play on the 3rd movement of the 20th Concerto. It didn't have the passion or fire I've come to expect from that movement. In fact, me personally, I think the whole set lacks a certain fire. I don't claim to be an expert, but his work on Mozart is nowhere near as good as his work on Beethoven. And other masters are much better at Mozart, in my opinion."
5,Simply Amazing,"I had not heard much of Ashkenazy's work prior to purchasing this album, so I wasn't sure what to expect. What I got was well worth my money times 10! For the most critical listener or just someone that wants to relax, this recording is a must!"
4,"Love the first set, avoid the second","We had the LP of ""An Evening with Belafonte and Makeba"" when I was a kid, so I was thrilled to be able to get this reissue on CD. It's as great as I remembered it, and the sound quality is better than the original vinyl.I would have been happy with just that album on the CD. To someone who didn't grow up with it and has no emotional attachment to it, ""The Magic of Makeba"" sounds very dated. The juxtaposition of the quasi-pop middle-of-the-road arrangements of that album with the pop African stylings of the first one is very jarring. I always jump to shut it off before the second set starts.I'm still giving the CD a rating of 4 stars because the first set, the Belafonte & Makeba album, is so good."
1,Overrated and Overpriced,"Sadly, I was required to purchase this book for an introductory Java course. The concepts presented are too basic to justify the price for this book, if purchased new. You can just as easily learn the same concepts from the excellent tutorials available online at Sun's, IBM's and other's websites for beginning Java developers. If you insist on a book, I suggest Bruce Eckel's ""Thinking in Java,"" which is cheaper in print and also available at no cost as a PDF download."
3,Over-the-Top Novel Keeps Pages Turning,"Life, Love & LonelinessCrystal Lacey WinslowMelodrama PublishingPPPLyric Devaney's acting career is on the verge of stardom. Amid turmoil with her past and present lovers, Lyric is making things happen. However, when her life takes a suprising turn, she decides to change her haughty, man-eating ways and change her life to one that includes helping, not using others.The story of Life, Love & Loneliness is told from the point of view of six characters. At several points in the novel, each individual story seems disconnected from the others. Too many point of views confuse the plot and add uneccesary details. Aside from this, Madison Michael's story is by far the most interesting, possibly more so than Lyric Devaney's.Life, Love & Loneliness is a dramatic, over-the-top tail with plenty of suprises to keep readers wondering what's going to happen next."
4,A Great Debut Novel,"This book was definitely a page turner. The characters are well crafted and by the end of the book, you feel for all of them in some way probably because you know someone something like that. There's a lot going on with plot twist and turns all along the way. Great first effort and hope to see much more from this author."
5,GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I advise everyone that is an avid reade as myself to please go out and get this book. Dont be fooled by the cover this book keeps the drama coming until the very last page. If you are interested a book thats has alot of drama without being to ghetto then this one is for you.
3,Drama,"Sisters of the Spirit, Bronx based all female book club, had their bimonthly book club meeting on Sat., January 18, 2003. Our general review of the book was that it had some realistic aspects,however,there was just too much drama."
3,Check Alternatives First,"I bought this thinking that it had everything I needed to clean my guitars and make them look good. The good pieces are the body polish, wax and the fingerboard conditioner. The wax and polish give the body a great shine and the conditioner is good for its purpose. However, the fretboard and string cleaners leave a bit to be desired. I found the fretboard cleaner didn't get a lot of the grit and dirt that had accumulated on the fingerboard off. Next time I cleaned it, I used an inexpensive all purpose cleaner, which worked very well. As for the string cleaner, if you are looking for something to make them feel like new, I would recommend GHS Fast Fret over this product. Dunlop is a great company, but there are a few superior alts for pieces of this set."
4,"Good cleaners, no residue.","I have 12 guitars and have been using Dunlop guitar cleaners for about a year with no complaints. The string cleaner removes oil, dirt from your hands that build-up on the strings over time. The body polisher works great and restores a polished luster to the finish without a greasy film left behind. The fret board cleaner is OK but I also polish with lemon oil which conditions and moisturizes the wood. Your guitars will look better, play better and the strings should last longer with regular cleaning. This kit is pretty expensive but worth it particularly if you own higher-end guitars."
4,everything works,"my guitar's body is like a black mirror now, and it holds that polish pretty well. the fingerboard cleaner and conditioner really darkened my bass's fingerboard and brought out the beautiful red and black colors. the string cleaner/conditioner is great especially if you are playing on stainless steel strings it doesn't give too much of a slippery feeling it's ""just right"", too early to tell about the effects on string life with it, but i'm sure it's supposed to loosen up dirt and oils and repel water. You can trust that your guitar is being taken care of with this kit."
4,Nice complete cleaning system,Nice complete system for cleaning. Has all the steps you need for any guitar maintenance. Nice cleaning clothes also included.
5,My shiny new Les Paul,"I wouldn't exactly call myself a guitar expert, but this kit really got the job done. It has everything you need for the basic upkeep of your guitar. I was able to polish my Les Paul from neck to body and even restore some of the shine on my dirty frets. For the bargain price on Amazon, it was worth every penny."
3,Hate the pushdown bottle heads!,I like Dunlop products but... The push down applicators (Dunlop's Dab-O-Matic Applicator Tops) are horrible idea. One popped right off the other day and oil got all over the place. I will not buy these again or I will remove them and just use a cloth.
3,"""After The Storm"" was too short","This was Chris' first CD after his close brush with death and his second-to-last CD. Unfortunately, after the storm came a worse event, Chris' untimely death in March 2005. As a LeDoux fan of more than 25 years, I was a bit disheartened that Chris wasn't writing more of his own material; too many of his preceding CDs got away from his rodeo/Western songs. Nevertheless, there are some fine songs here, and except for ""Haywire"" and ""Stampede,"" there's no such thing as a less-than-good Chris LeDoux album. ""Cowboy Up"" and ""Scatter My Ashes"" are the best songs on the CD. Little did we know how prescient the latter was, as sadly, Chris didn't have much time left with us. Chris LeDoux was the best."
1,the worst he's done period,"Come on Chris, i know this is your ""comeback"" album but where's the cowboy stuff that made you who you are????"
2,Ok for Upper Body,"I bought this tape because I have an old version of Great Body Low Impact Aerobics that I love. I've had it for 20+ years and it's wearing out. So, I thought I'd ""upgrade"" to one with weights.I was a little disappointed in that it only works your upper body. I was hoping for more aerobics with the weight training. It's an ok tape, but not exactly what I was looking for.A couple of the movements are hard to follow, but with time will become routine. It's very much like my first tape, but without as much aerobics. A good buy for the price I paid, though."
5,Hilarious,"I'm an American who bought this book a few years ago, and I still get a laugh every time I read it. An Italian who spent a year in America, around Washington DC, Beppe Severgnini chronicles the foibles of the country with a gentle, teasing wit. His experiences with such things as huge glasses of ice water at restaurants, U.S. notions of central heating/ air conditioning, and dealing with American credit card companies make both fascinating and hilarious reading for Americans (at least, this American :) ), affording a look at our culture from the outside. One of these days I mean to check out his ""Field Guide to the Italian Mind"" to see if it's as funny as this is. I just wish, as one of the previous reviewers commented, that he'd come on back and write a sequel--I'd buy it, in a heartbeat."
3,Bill Bryson with a little more empathy,"I've just finished this book. Its clear that the author likes America but he's still compelled to provide the same sophomoric satire that irritates me about Bill Bryson.The book does have some good moments. Its good to get a little satire from the other side of the pond. (this is fairly kind satire, by the way). However, I wouldn't recommend buying this book new (I did). Borrow it, instead."
1,Clearly Politically Motivated,"As usual some italians never miss a chance to complain and bash about things they either don't have or don't understand. Clearly the author has been living in the stone age far too long. What does he mean with ""How many people have actually ever bought an airline ticket over the internet?"". Probably every single person I know! Or ""How many people have actually ever sent data over the internet?"". Practically the entire US population! His observations are not only shallow and over analyzed, most of them are just not accurate. Further, he fails to capture the true underlying issues embedded in the American way of life. The social and cultural issues that are ripping this country apart. A very poor analysis of non-issues that are, for the most part, just a result of his ignorance. His arrogance. Money NOT well spent I must say. P.S. I am an Italian living in the US."
2,Friend or foe?,"""Ciao America"" is an OK book for all the people that know Italians, their daily habits and problems with the ""Italian system"". Beppe Severgnini is an ok writer that, for a period of time, was considered a good kept secret. But when success came about with the Italian version of ""Ciao America"" I believe he lost track of reality. I consider him a ""fan"" of the Italian opposition party (socialist/communist) and I believe he betrayed his former editor, Silvio Berlusconi Now the Italian Prime Minister & strong US allied, for opportunistic reasons. Now he betrays the USA by campaigning against the US coalition. Not good! Do not support him!"
5,"It's a ""Bible"" for Italian travellers in the US","I have read the Italian version of this book while spending the summer of 1999 in Washington DC. For me and my other Italian friends who were with me at the time this book was like the ""Bible"" for Italian travellers in the US. Finally we felt like somebody understood our experience and our feelings, I never read anything that mirrors so closely my own experience there, expect for the fact that I went there as a student at Georgetown.I advise everyone to read this book, as it it interesting and funny both for Italians, who will recognise themselves into at least some of the situations, and for anybody else, who will be able to have a better insight into the Italian mentality."
3,Nice; warn cup first!,Nice machine enjoyable cup of Joe. I think you should warm your cup first then brew.
3,The Golden Mask by Robyn Donald (Large Print Harlequin),"Description from the book back cover:There wasn't any reason for rich, charismatic Blade Hammond to waste a second glance on her, Eden admitted to herself. The hard, grueling work of making a living for herself and her grandfather from a sheep station that was dying on its' feet meant there was no money for pretty clothes, and no time to make the best of herself. Besides, Blade looked upon her as a little sister to be protected and sheltered, not a grown woman who was ready for love. Was there no way of convincing him otherwise?"
4,An enjoyable read!,"Engaging and accessible suspense thriller, that is brought to life through the author's intimate knowledge of medicine. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and look forward to his next novel."
5,Tantalizing....,"I usually don't go for SciFi's but this book was recommended by a friend and I'm glad I read it. I couldn't put it down. I was spellbound, its fast pace, riveting plot, kept me absorbed throughout. You want a book to read on the plane, train, or just tucked up in bed, this one's IT...Immortalis, it's only fault was that it had to end, or did it?"
2,Baby Rattle not so good!,"The rattle was not of good quality and in addition, took forever to arrive in the mail. The rattle did not come in a box and already has acquired dents."
5,Excellent Band!,"Noise Ratchet really is my favorite emo band even though bands don't really like to be labeled as emo. Along with other local San Diego bands, I have had the chance to seen them often at local venues. Sadly they have recently broken up but who knows if they will return with a new lineup. Every song on here is sooo good, you never have to hit the skip button when listening to it. Track 5 is probably my least favorite but it is still pretty good. Also they put on one of the best live shows I have ever seen. They are just filled with so much energy on stage, you really have to see them to belive it. Also I have heard some people say they don't like them anymore because they had heard that they weren't Christian anymore. I don't know if it is true or not(I don't think they are anti-Christian or anything)because they were never a super evangelical preaching band or anything. Anyways this is a must have for emo,punk fans!"
5,oh yeah!!,"I've been waiting for this cd to come out for awhile now. And the wait is finally over,and boy, was it worth it. This cd is SO GOOD. very melodic, very emotional, some parts make me shudder. ah man - keep an eye out for these guys - they are sure to be huge one day."
5,WWF Backlash 2000,This ppv is one of the best of 2000. Almost every match was good except a few. Big Show will have you crying because what he does is so funny.Matches and Ratings1) Tag Team titles: Champions Edge & Christian vs. Road Dogg & X-Pac with Tori- ***2) Light Heavyweight title: Champion Dean Malenko vs. Scotty Too Hotty- ****3) Big Boss Man & Bull Buchanan vs. Acolytes- *4) Hardcore title: Champion Crash Holly vs. Tazz vs. Perry Saturn vs. Hardcore Holly vs. Hardy Boyz- ***1/45) The Big Show vs. Kurt Angle- DUD6) T & A with Trish Stratus vs. Dudley Boyz- *1/47) European title: Champion Eddie Guerrero with Chyna vs. Essa Rios with Lita- ***1/28) Intercontinental title: Champion Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho- ****9) WWF title: Champion Triple H with Vince McMahon & Stephanie McMahon vs. The Rock with Steve Austin- ****1/2
5,One of the best Of 2000,"Wow is the only word you can say to this event.From top to bottem every ""Superstar put out an A+ effort. The only match that really turned me off was the acoyltes/BossMan/Bull Buchanon match. Other wise the event was awsome. from The opening match of DXvs.E and C, To the Hardcore title match, To the Big Shows latest parody, To Buh ray dudley finally getting Trish, Eddie Gurrero and Essa Rios in a great high flying match, To the canadian brutality match of BenoitVS.Jericho, To the return of Austin 3:16. The event never had a dull moment. Two thumbs up"
5,Best of 2000,"This was definitely the best ppv of 2000, even better than Wrestlamania. The matches were brilliant and finally the return of Stone Cold even if it was only for a couple of minutes. The Rock did the best Rock Bottom I have ever seen. The other matches were great too including the Essa Rios and Eddy Guerro with lots of high risk moves. Matt Hardy's amazing move in the hardcore match summed up what for me was an excellent event."
2,WWF BACKLASH 2000 $30?? That's a joke!,"I'm sorry but this backlash is'nt worth $30, it's ridiculously overpriced and it's not worth it... I'd wait until the price drops down to $10.... My suggestions for buying any PPV from the 2000 Era are Fully Loaded, No Mercy, Unfogiven,Armageddon, Judgementday, Summerslam, WM16 is also overpriced and I'd wait to get that on DVD when the price drops..."
1,My Least Favorite Christmas album,"I try every year to add holiday music to my CD collection and I thought I was safe after reading the reviews for this one. But, unfortunately, it has fallen to the bottom of my collection and is my least favorite."
2,limited information,"Good basic beginners book. Limited number of pages of information that could have been more detailed. I am just exploring building a greenhouse and was seeking advice from this book. I did increase my knowledge to some degree and was not overly disappointed considering the low price but I will need to keep searching for a ""better"" book."
4,Love it!!,"Very helpful, informative... it arrived quickly and without issue. It is great, but will need to find more books to answer more questions."
2,Booklist starred review - No Way!,"I can't believe this book received a starred review in Booklist. As a librarian, I am a faithful reader of Booklist. This is the first time I've seen a book fall way short of it's ""professional review"". In one word, this book was BORING! Every interaction between the hero and heroine, right down to the actual dialogue, was basically the same. The author and the heroine started to get on my nerves and if I read one more line about the wonderful qualities of being a Texan I was going to scream. Don't waste your time or your money with this repetitive snoozer."
2,OUTRAGEOUS ????,"This book is 345 pages long and the word ""outrageous"" is used 345+ times. On one page it was used 5 times. I recently purchased all the books in this series to date, but if the next one starts out like this one (which I kept hoping would get better) then they are all going into my ""donation"" pile. Having been an avid reader of this author's earlier books - it was hard for me to believe she was not the same writer I was used to from 10 years ago."
1,Yuck,"On the front cover it says ""One of the finest writers of the decade"" Romantic Times. I am in trouble if this is one of the finest. I did not enjoy her writing at all. In the past, I have said that I would never write a review on a book that I did not finish. Well, I have given up on that motto. I have struggled to finish so many mediocre books. I'm not wasting my time with this one. Made it to page 90. BORING!!! Nothing there to keep me reading further. Couldn't care less about Lacey or Blackie. It's books like this that make me want to dump the romance category all together."
4,All the essentials on two discs,"Other reviewers have written sufficiently on the quality of this purchase; I don't need to add to it, only concur with them that this is a fabulous and inexpensive package. My only criticism is of the sound quality...and maybe the performance of the 14th. It's a minor issue though. No other package that I know of gives the buyer all the essential sonatas on two discs of such high quality. A great buy."
4,Vladimir plays Ludwig,"Vladimir Ashkenazy is known as one of the best pianists of the last century, and he possesses great technique and colour. The interpretations for this Sonatas are ferocious, masterful, and melodic, as Beethoven might have liked. I enjoy and like very much this compilation because the named Sonatas are the most cherished, beloved and awe-inspiring of the whole set. I like Ashkenazy's playing, but it can have more emotional deepness. For example, the second movement of Pathétique is not played Adagio, but much like an Andante. Do I recommend it? Yes, I do."
5,"Pure genius, in composition and in performance","Disclaimer: I'm not an expert on classical music, much less on classical music performances, so my reviews represent a newcomer's take on classical CDs. Take that for what it's worth.This recording of Beethoven's sonatas was the first classical CD I ever bought, and it remains my favorite. The compositions are heart-rending. The performance is excellent. This is an album equally great both for classically-uninitiated and for longtime veterans.Ashkenazy's performance makes heavy use of dynamics, from near-inaudible pianissimos to shattering fortissimos. Some people may dislike this--it's not an album to pop into your walkman and ignore--but I found that it gave the sonatas a richer emotional resonance. As the piano goes from a quiet, singing tone to harsh clanging, so one's heart follows. This CD (or rather, CDs) is a must-buy."
1,Ashkenazy goes horribly wrong.....,"I admire Ashkenazy for his Mozart Concerti(20, 21, 23, 24, 25), all his Chopin except for a slow Raindrop Prelude, all his Beethoven Piano Concerti in 1986-1987 with the Cleveland Orchestra and his wonderful playing on the Beethoven Violin Sonatas with Perlman. He is also outstanding with Rachmaninov's Piano Concerti, wonderful.However when it comes to Beethoven's Piano Sonatas, it's almost as though he's afraid to play it straight and he totally upsets the dynamics of every piece, usually too slow, too tentative in all the wrong places, a good example is how slowly he plays the opening chords to the Appassionatta, no passion whatsoever!He has not the least sensitivity to this monument of music, what a terrible disappointment and waste of 7 years recording. For much better LvB Piano Sonatas try Rudolf Serkin, John O'Conor instead. O'Conor is especially good with the Hammerklavier."
1,I would rate the CD...IF I COULD ONLY HEAR IT!!!!,Hopefully this is only due to a defective copy of the CD but the copy I received was barely audible. I tested it on numerous media players with no success and am in the process of getting a refund from Amazon. Be wary...
3,Shocked and Dismayed,"All right....after book 10, roughly, this series rapidly began to go downhill. It turned into a cheap soap opera--and I am still hopelessly addicted.I was really, really angry at the shocker ending. It has quite a bit to do with Sam, so Sam fans be warned. I didn't like Sam, but that was a bad move to make with his character. I for one am not happy.There were, however, some saving graces. For example, Tom Moore's adventures in Europe made for exciting reading, and the big revelation (why Loki REALLY wants Gaia) is made--and it will blow you away. That was genius. The other thing...wasn't. But the rest was quite good, aside from that.So, I hope that everything is tied together in the next book--which I will certainly read, because I am hopelessly hooked."
5,Wow,"If you like this series, you are in for a shocker with this book. When I finished it, I was had the urge to throw the book across the room. I enjoyed the book, but there was a very unexpected twist to it. I am not one that likes to spoil books for people so I shall not tell you. I recommend that everyone who has read any of the Fearless books reads this one!!!"
4,UH OH,"If you are a big sam fan you will really really hate this book.Even though i wasn't exactly a huge fan of sams i still hated the ending.in this book you find out exactly why loki is chasing gaia around and let me tell you, he is one sick dude.Even though it had some bad points i still loved Flee( its a fearless book how could i not)so i recommend it to fearless followers.Im really sad to say the ending indicates the fearless series is finishing ( how can it!!!!)"
2,Your money....,product works and is dependable but the price is high and there are larger capacity chips out there for the same price
4,All Right Deal,"This RAM is a little bit too expensive, But it's good just to be able to order it and have it there. Half the stores dont sell ram or the lowest they have is 64. So overall this is a pretty good deal"
1,Baloney,"First of all her husband was found cavorting around for an hour in a gay bar telling men that he was gay. He also was interviewed and often said that he and his wife were not fully 'cured' of their homosexuality. Also, research was conducted and they could not find ONE ex-lesbian partner of hers. She finally admitted that she had more of an emotional connection with women as opposed to a sexual one. She is not nor never has been a lesbian. Also, she fails to note that there are MANY hetrosexual people who have domineering mothers and fathers - this argument is old, out dated and was never a proven argument. She and the organization she works for have a proven track record of not changing anyone other than hetrosexual people who were experimenting and were never actually gay or lesbian. They would admit it but there is too much money to be made - all this book does is perpetuate lies."
1,Horrible.,Trying to change who you naturally are and were meant to be is unnatural. This is the sort of literature that drives people to depression and unfortunately suicide.
1,this is trash,"this type of literature hurts people and leads people to commit suicide because they can't ""overcome"" their homosexual inclinations.being gay is not a curse and there is no ""cure."""
1,Dangerous misinformation,"If you are looking for a resource based on current psychological research on homosexuality, you should be aware that this book is totally incompatible with responsible science. It is the work of an affiliate of a far-right evangelical Christian group, Exodus International, whose orientation is theological rather than scientific (they hold that homosexuality is a 'disease' and can be 'cured' through Christianity - a view rejected by, among others, the American Psychological Association). If that's what you're looking for then you should enjoy and appreciate this book; however, I for one find it really offensive when people like this author try to hide a religious agenda behind pseudoscience."
5,old edition ... look for the revised edition,"This is John Sheirer, the author of this book. This edition is the old one originally done by McGraw-Hill but now out of print. It has since been republished in a revised edition by iUniverse, so look for that one instead. It's a very practicle, readable, brief book about giving speeches. If you want to give better speeches, I promise you'll enjoy the book and be a better public speaker. Thanks!"
5,Perfect introduction to reality of life,"This book was great, The most amazing thing for me was catching myself laughing. Usually these type of books tend to get boring, but the writers managed to preserve the balance of fun and lightness along with the plenty of useful info and guidance."
3,Not too good,"Not too good of a book. I'd suggest using this as a general idea, but get other, bettter books."
3,Out of date,"The best part of this book was the section on resume and cover letters because I revamped mine after looking at their examples. There is a section where you can ask your parents questions and see how they answer, so that was fun and cute. Overall, the book has good intentions but it is extremely out of date. It does not factor for the 2010 recent college grad. It talked about e-mail like a modern phenomenon sweeping the nation! It did not focus nearly enough on the tough job market or give any real tips. It really is a book of basic common sense and now even common knowledge. But the delivery is playful and engaging."
2,I really don't like it,"This book really is not very good. It is depressing, and it talks down to you like you really have NO idea what is going on. It makes life after college look just awful."
1,Avoid this Scam.,"As bad as "" Natural Cures they don't want you to know about"". No novel or useful information. Waste of money and hope for those who are sick."
3,The Angry Puppet Syndrome,"Review of The Angry Puppet Syndrome, by John Menkes""The Angry Puppet Syndrome"" is a tautly written medical-legal thriller about corruption and greed in high places-a work that informs as well as entertains. Menkes provides us with an insider's view of what goes on between big-time pharmaceutical companies and the medical profession and it is not an edifying picture. But some of the leading characters are forced to do battle with their conscience and come out on the side of right. At the same time others close their eyes to the damage done by the use of experimental drugs on unsophisticated patients. The author's delightful asides on the human condition give promise of what we can expect from his next work. This is a book that is hard to put down. If you are going on a long plane trip take it with you. Time will fly!Laguna Reader."
5,Dr. Menkes wrote a medical thriller!,"Every pediatrician knows Dr. Menkes as an author of Textbook of Child Neurology or a discoverer of 'Menkes kinky hair syndrome.' I haven't read through the thick textbook yet, but I finished The Angry Puppet Syndrome to the last page. I don't like the ending and the scene of some Japanese researchers making a blunder, although it is quite realistic, unfortunately. I found the author a very good storyteller and learned some of the research funding system of the US which is quite different from Japan. I expect his next novel eagerly."
1,"Should Be Titled ""How to Confuse Your Kids""","We received this book as a gift, and while it is a warm and fuzzy story, I would not recommend it for Christian families who want to explain the true meaning of Christmas to their children.This book partners Santa and Jesus as equals and does nothing but confuse the young reader about why we celebrate Christmas. The story is silly and preposterous. One day my children will find out that Santa is make believe, and I don't want them also questioning the existence of Jesus.If you want to read a story to your children about ""How Christmas Began"", why not go to Luke 2 in the Bible and get the official story. This one we can all do without."
5,love it,"I love that I can include santa at Christmas. As a Christian household, we teach our little ones about Jesus and we celebrate Christmas as HIS birthday. To be able to also use santa like everyone else is pretty cool"
5,A must have for your kids!,"This is a wonderful book to share with children during the CHRISTmas season. Although not biblically based, of course, it does provide a great story of how Jesus and Santa come up with a way to identify and give presents to all those in the world who have the special glow of Jesus in their heart. Young kids in our world today are inevitably inundated with Santa, and I think this book helps them to see Santa in a wonderful light as (in the book) he is blessed by Jesus and is therefore able to do what he does at Christmas time."
1,Disappointed with product,I bought this product because I was told that it had a good fragrance. NOT! It stinks to high heaven! I did not give this gift to my man because it was so bad.
5,60s was one of the greatest decades for great instrumentals,"The 60s had some of the most diverse and greatest instrumentals of all time ranging from jazz, to bossa nova, to rock n roll. This compilation contains some of the most popular 60s instrumentals and the ones that aren't included in this are included in volume 2 by YHP. These instrumentals were as good the British invasion rock and bossa nova that was dominating the charts at this same time. The Stripper, Pink Panther, and Exodus are probably the most well-known and best of this collection. Its a shame instrumentals aren't like this anymore, after the 60s instrumentals slowly declined in popularity as rock began to take over the charts."
2,Very Messy,"This does not peel off cleanly! Was a huge mess and ended up having to rinse my feet off in the tub, which made them feel dry again."
4,Underground,this is true underground lyrical poetry at its finest i enjoy every bit of this music i personally know this MC and he gifted beyond belief i wish and hope pray to see his crew rise to the C.R.E.A.M like steamPeace and keep dreamingLoneStarr AKA DrocaBEAT
4,lots of fun,"Not only did the author create an interesting set of characters, but he also created a fully realized vision of baseball in the year 2000 (this was written in 1995). Yogi Berra and Hank Aaron as league presidents; new teams added and others in different cities; standings for all of the teams; and best of all... Baseball Commissioner Dan Quayle.The book mixes baseball with speculative fiction, a little romance, and some suspense.A winner all around"
5,Another knock-out winner!,"Gorman Bechard does it again. The tone is playful, yet knowing. Pop-culture skewering continues, just like ""Second Greatest Story"". This can be our future, if only we will wise up and let it. Louise is just as cool as Ilona, and she beats her head against the same brick walls: our close-minded world. This is a good fast read, but it is not ""light"" reading by any means. This book should change your life. Another great mother/daughter relationship, friendships, etc. This is an extraordinary woman who is just like all of us, but doing more than we can even imagine. A great book!"
5,looks great,"The shirt looks graet, it arrived very well packed , one might think it is a food since there is a peach picturs on the box.Did not used it yet."
2,Short shirt,"This shirt fits okay, but it was very short . I keep feeling as If it is riding up. A little bit uncomfortable."
3,OK,"I'm usually a small or xs - ordered the small and glad I did. I think the xs would have been more form-fitting, but the fabric is not too stretchy and would restrict movement. The fabric is also very shiney, silky, and soft, but not matte or sueded - not sure why it's called ""peach skins"".Pros:- Good proportions - sleeves, body length, chest, and shoulders.- Feels nice to the touch.Cons:- The neck opening is reeeeeeeeeally small. It feels fine after it was on, and maybe it's a small opening to keep you warm, but it barely stretches at all to fit over your head, so it messes up your hair and makeup.- Not too much stretch in the cuffs of the sleeves, either.- Wore it for outside activities and didn't think it was THAT warm - when the temp dropped below 57, I needed a jacket.- Not that thin"
1,a far cry..... fading fast,"EHC originally had a very unique INSPIRED sound. They have devolved and lost their inspiration. Steer clear of the new stuff. Thomas Thorn is simply trying to make EHC an acceptable metal band after years of painful rejection. A few wrong turns have taken them off the left-hand path completely, physically, creatively, mentally. Artistic conformity is an ugly bird with few feathers. Come on guys..... you could have found a better middle ground between the psychedelic-disco-grind sound that made you vibrant and the metal sound that could've got you more loyal evil followers. oh well, the masterminds are out to lunch. atleast we have Burn Baby Burn and Kiss the Goat to look back on, listen to, and wonder what happened to that progressive satanic vision, and what could have been....... good recipe's are hard to come by and bad cook's have crappy taste buds."
5,outstanding,Etta Clark does an outstanding job showing us that old age can be entered into gracefully; the pictures and bio info are great
1,Do Not Buy,Misleading as far as ease of hookup. Bulldog tech told me it only saves you having to hook up 6 less wires. This harness only eliminates the ignition system hookups. You still must hook up for everything else from the 16 pin. Don't waste your money!
2,Do not spend the money,"It is a nice add on to your budget...but it comes with no diagram so by the time you are trying to find out wich wire is what...save yourself some money and just cut the exesting wires from the car, wich you will have to do it anyway just because you have like 50 of them to connect. So just cut five more...Big Deal..."
2,first diy for remote starter,"It is good product but expensive I think.I bought this product for convenient, but really it wasn't.This product needed wide space but my car didn't."
1,There is no zero stars...,"... so I give this one ill deserved star. I love classical music. In particular I love string quartets. The Cure is fantastic. I thought this piece of junk might be magical. Hah! The arrangements are boring. The pace is ponderous. These ""tributes"" completely miss the point of the original wonderful cure songs. The only selection that isn't utter trash is ""Lovecats"". It's actually pretty good. I actually did discard this useless CD after the second bleak listen."
2,It's a bunch of violins doing Cure. And?,"Ok, so, what the hey. The String Quartet tributes are popping up like bloody mushrooms after a spring rain, which isn't necessarily a good thing. Not that it's a bad idea -- many of the bands covered are probably well managed by these instruments -- but this one, and the two TOOL I also own, are not exactly inspiring. (And if you can recognize ""Hot Hot Hot !!!"" by ear without being told, you deserve an award.) Everything is played blandly, and, in some cases, fairly oddly -- many notes are played counter to what would conceivably work better.The selections are crap; possibly, the group wanted a mix of everything, but it's all mostly new, and mostly music that isn't even suited to the instruments. I shudder to think what would have happened if ""The Cure"" came out before this one. Terrible songs played even worse, most likely.But, if you simply like instrumental music, it's not bad. It's just not necessarily The Cure."
1,"As valuable as a ""Time Life"" book on how to drive a nail.","This book is a glossy generalists dream. If you don't know what a well is, buy this book. If you don't know what a septic tank is, buy this book. If you can't tell the difference between a submrsible pump or a jet pump, buy this book.If you want to design or install your own hideaway water system, forget it. The author makes to frequent use of ""consult your owners manual"", ""local authorities"" or ""hire someone"" to have any real value.This book would benefit the rural homeowner who has never owned a well, septic, etc. and needs to talk with a repair service. It would be unadvisable to attempt installation or repair of any system with knowledge gained from just this book."
1,33 Very short Hymns,The music and choir are great but the hymns are incomplete. All songs are from 50 secs long to 2 mins long and the songs get cut off at the end and it leaves you hanging. I wish I could find the full version of all the songs from this group.
1,If you'd rather listed to the samples on Amazon than the entire song....,"If you like listening to the samples here on Amazon so much that you'd rather do that than buy the CD than this is the recording for you! If your the type of person who likes to start something but never finishes you will love this CD! It's the music you love in smaller portions. A diet for your ears! Who knew listening to the entire song would make your brain flabby. Hey guys, it's like listening to your wife. You only hear the first 30 seconds and the rest fades off.The tittle is misleading. Should read '33 to 50 seconds of these Christmas Hymns'."
5,"Energy Anatomy: The Science of Personal Power, Spirituality,",This was one of the most moving informative and soul touching audio book I have ever listened to. My thanks to Ms Myss for having the thoughtfulness to share all of this with us. I have tried what she talks about and it works.
5,A superb and rich spiritual stimulant and growth catalyst.,"Carolyn Myss explores the archetypal boundary between the cosmic energy field and the collective unconscious. She demonstrates a way of seeing that connects those energy/archetype interactions to patterns of physical illness, as well as to patterns of spiritual empowerment or energy drain. No one else comes close to summoning up the scope and intensity of vision that characterize these works. What she says is brilliant, what she implies will be breathtaking as it unfolds throughout the next millennium."
5,This tape series is THE definitive Carolyn Myss,"I listen to a lot of personal growth tapes. My orientation is to listen for material to apply to my life. I don't like vague theories. I began using Carolyn's ideas immediately and have found that they are changing my life.A key point she makes is that you don't have to take 20 years to heal from a trauma. You can ""call your spirit back"" from past painful events and disappointments. This very simple notion, when applied during meditation, can transform your life. Try it. As they say on TV ""It really, really works!"""
4,Energy Anatomy,"Carolyn Myss is brilliant, entertaining, witty, sarcastic, irrational, and high-handed at any given time. She admits that she teaches rather than heals because she isn't good at one on one. But she is a gifted teacher. Listening to the CDs the third time I still gained more information and have since shared them with friends of like mind. If you're drawn to increasing your knowledge of the spiritual journey, this is a great set of CDs to listen to. She offers several interesting theorys, some believable, some not, but still entertaining."
3,Advanced Energy is better,"By happenstance, I listened to the Advanced Energy series before I listened to Energy Anatomy. I found Myss's presentation and material far better on the Advanced series. So much so that I had to force myself to listen all the way through the Energy series. I had to keep reminding myself that I agreed with what she was saying. It made sense to me. I had to focus on the message and not the tone. When I listened to Advanced Energy, I couldn't wait to hear the next tape and was disappointed when I finished the last. I wish I hadn't bought Energy Anatomy but had borrowed it from the library instead. Clearly, I highly recommend Advanced Energy."
3,20 yrs not enough,"Speer fooled the Nurenberg tribunal. He admitted guilt and because Jackson, the US prosecuter, did a poor job of knowing the facts and keeping them straight, Speer was able to dodge the hangman. Without the dogged persevereance of the Russian prosecuter, Speer might have walked.It was puzzling and sad that so many of Speers associates from the Armaments Group felt Speer betraded the leader, Hitler, and Germany. The book presents Speer as a good example of the many German citizens who went over the top for Hitler because they were in a position to personally profit from the period of National Socialism represented by the Nazis. This is an interesting book and the disclosure by Rudolph Wolters in his ""Chronicles"" indicates Speer was guilty of other crimes that he was never held accountable for. This is the first book I've read about Speer that discloses the existence of the ""Chronicle"" source kept by Wolters who worked daily with Speer. My hat's off to the author."
5,Brilliant and Infectious,"Very seldom do I bother to post comments for books ... but, in this instance it is warranted.Caprice Crane is a very talented artist; capable of vivid imagery as well as biting wit and rauccous, riotous laughter. Caprice's writing style and choice of subject matter just blow the reader away simultaneously pulling him/her into the all-too familiar and believable situation and not letting go until every muscle in the body - from the forehead (laugh lines) down to the tippy-toes (from toe-curling laughter) - is sore from irrepressable, irresistable laughter.I came across this book and authoress due to myspace and mutual friends and i couldn't be happier that I did.I know that anyone who reads this will be immensely pleased ... and, as a suggestion ... be careful while reading, you're gonna laugh 'till you lose all control, haha.ENJOY!!! I know I did, as did many, many others."
2,Lightweight but Entertaining,"""Stupid and Contagious"" is a quick enjoyable read, but not terribly original. It's highly derivative of Nick Hornby's work -- you'll find numerous similarities between it and ""High Fidelity"" and ""About A Boy"" -- and the novel ""Syrup"" by Maxx Barry. The female character is great, so I hope Crane gives her a new, more interesting life in her next novel."
5,One of the best books ever,It just gets better and better as you read and it has a great ending.I hope they make a movie :)
5,phenominal,"It took me 2 nights to read and it was worth every moment. The book is hysterical. It really captures the thoughts of a 20 something year old. It was written really well and if you know anything about music, your in for a added treat. i recommended this book to 3 people and they all loved it. They should really make it into a movie. I cant wait for her next book!!"
5,Silly and Contagious,"Oh, this is such a cute book! In light of the recent publication of Crane's second book,Forget About It, I felt like re-reading it. It had been quite a while, so I only really recalled the more memorable ""cameo"" appearances by real-life characters Ben Stiller and Manfred Mann. Well, and of course, the delicious-sounding Cinnamilk. This book is just a cute and funny read! And it would make a funny gift to give someone on their 27th birthday. Though picking favorites is typically easy, I really can't decide which of Crane's two books are my favorite. I just hope that a third one comes out soon!"
4,Wacky to the end,"At first, I found Heather to be annoyingly daft and Brady to be self-absorbed - which usually means I will disinterested in the fate of the characters by chapter five (like ""Family Affair"" also written by Crane). But I have to admit she created them in a way that you grow to like them in spite on their flaws. I found myself thinking I'd like to meet them for drinks one night. The humor was perfect throughout the book - touching the boundary of silliness that can turn a good book into a bad piece of fluff but never going past it."
5,laugh out loud funny,This book was soo funny I couldn't stop laughing or put it down. I picked it up randomly at the bookstore and it was definatly worth it. I have told everyone about it. Can't wait for her next book hope it is soon.
3,Entertaining,"I think Crane has potential to become a good writer, but needs to be more original. The two main characters are the same as those we've seen in hundreds of romantic comedy movies/books, and the plot was pointless and dull. Having said that, I found the dialogue amusing and entertaining."
3,A light read without much substance,"I heard about this book per a recommendation from a friend. I decided to check it out and read the first few sections available for free on amazon. It had me laughing so I decided to buy it. The book switches from the perspective of the girl and then the guy. It's humorous and entertaining as you get both perspectives and the uncensored thoughts of both individuals. However, the story is a little lack-luster. It was a light read so if you're looking for something that doesn't require too much thought or attention, this may be a good option. But I was looking for something a little more advanced than the typical teen fiction level writing.And a little side note, I really didn't care for the main character Heaven. Her mentality was just completely bonkers."
4,page-turning rockin read,You certainly dont need to be musically-inclined to enjoy this rockin book. i loved the pace and couldnt help root for the main two characters to unite - was fun to read!
5,"Excellent book, fun read!","Stupid & Contagious was so funny that I stayed up half the night to finish it, I couldn't put it down. The main characters are fun and lovable. This is truly a hit for Crane. I can't wait to read her next one."
3,Language!!!!!!!!!!!!,If you can get pasted the used of the F-word and other swear words almost constantly the story is good.
1,title should be stupid and contrived!,"After reading ""Forget About It"" (which I loved), I was ready to scoop up everything by this author. However, the writing just seems stupid, contrived and forced. The back and forth between Heaven and Brady's story just didn't work and felt gimmicky. I couldn't feel any actual chemistry between Heaven and Brady and both of them (especially Heaven) acted like stupid, spoiled children. It's good that I read Forget About It first, because I found it as good as this is bad, and if I had read this one first I would have given up on Caprice Crane. This one goes in the donation pile."
1,Awful,"I tried hard to finish this book because it was recommended by a friend. I got about three-quarters of the way through it before abandoning it for more stimulating reading -- like, for example, the ingredients of a nearby tube of toothpaste. There's absolutely nothing original about this book. The protagonists are annoying and nearly indistinguishable from one another. They're exactly the kind of characters that, if you met them in real life, you'd find yourself fighting the urge to punch them in the stomach."
4,Random meetings - Fun book,"Do you need to ponder the, ""Why the heck did I meet this person?"", ""Why does this person always show up at the worst times?"" or ""Why did a normal situation 5 minutes ago, turn into something only a freak would do?"" questions. This book has some funny answers for this, it is a light read and will have you laughing about the hilarity of people who have nothing left to lose. Cinnamilk forever. BTW - My sister did this as a child, since we were out of cocoa, it tastes badly without the sugar. :)"
5,Isabella doesnt know what she is talking about,"this book was hilarious, i too found myself laughing in public. isabella does not know what she is talking about when she reviewed this book. that is why she stands alone with her opinion and there are far too many 5 star ratings. my family and friends always would ask what is so funny about that book, my reply is ""you just have to read it!"" this is what i tell those who are considering buying this book, ""you just have to read it,"" you wont be disappointed."
2,Definitely stupid; Hope it's not contagious.,"I don't know. Maybe I expect too much from the books I read, even the frivolous girly ones. I just didn't like the main characters in this one, and after awhile found myself not caring about what happened between them. Make Heaven a little smarter, and not a carbon copy of a gazillion vacuous women in this world, and maybe I'd be interested.I wonder if any of Gilligan's kids got a book deal, and if it's any better than this."
3,"Love, Hate and Stupidity","Stupid and Contagious makes you wish the characters were real so they could spend the rest of their lives driving each other crazy. Also, a few more years of their heavy drinking and their habit of stuffing their faces with donuts, pancakes, double burgers, etc., would eventually bring results that might stop Heaven and Brady from looking down their noses at ""fat"" and ""old"" people they encounter.That said, Crane is a talented writer with a sense of humor I appreciate. I have read Forget About It, which is a much better novel. I look forward to finding out what this author will do, and how she will choose to develop and grow when it comes to her storytelling, in the coming years."
4,"Great art, and well over 300 pages!","Hey I really liked this graphic novel! Dan Berger's Gutwallow the Gingerbread Man is a fun read with great art and a swell cast of likable characters. While Gutwallow himself can sometimes be more annoying than cute (and he bares a striking resemblance to Cerebus) in the end he will finally win you over. The bonus back up stories are especially fun to read. If you like Bone, Disney cartoons, magic, aliens and gingerbread men, this is the comic for you!Dwayne"
5,Great shoe,I love this product so much I have been buying the same style for five years now. This shoe is so comfortable and light it makes walking a breeze.
4,Quite comfortable walking shoe. Wide sizes available.,"First of all, I am quite disappointed by amazon free shipping service and their shipping tactics. Once you order an item but select budget free shipping amazon will hold this item in warehouse few days before shipping. I had to bump shipping method to a faster one but it did not seem to impact speed of the shipment. It changed status to shipping soon immediately but the shoes were shipped next day.Secondly, the shoe was a litle narrow when initially arrived but after 2 weeks of breaking in it is very comfortable. I used them for hiking and extensive walking in Prag and they minimized fatigue.Thirdly, the shoes have a tendency to skid on wet surfaces such as coble stones or on an inclined escalator.I rate them 4 1/2 (hence 4 stars). Definitely, worth 45 bucks I paid but list price of 90 is too steep for my taste (I am cheap).I will buy more wide size Saucony shoes for sure."
3,"OK, BUT NOT DURABLE","Bought these because of a recommendation in a magazine, but they were not very durable... After a couple of months they started to hiss when I walked, apparently the airbags broke...And I only way 175 so I would only guess that if you are heavier they would fall apart quicker..."
2,Hmmmm..! Great shoe.. Yes and No!!,"Well I should have heeded other people when they said to go up to the next size for a proper fit. My feet are typical in that I have no special medical requirements from any shoe. I have healthy average feet. These shoes from what I could tell from my short time to audition them was Yes.. very comfortable shoe, great cushioning, feel great on the feet. No..! they do run small and narrow. after a half hour trial with just a medium thick sock on... I decided to return them for a pair the next size up. I'm disappointed that I couldn't be wearing then now.. right away.. they did feel great... just a little cramped for long term wearing."
3,Not Comfortable...,"Within minutes of trying these on and walking around my house, I knew they would be uncomfortable. They do not provide sufficient support, especially if you have a high arch. They also seemed to be poorly cushioned.Would not recommend."
3,Just OK,"So far, these shoes are ok. The fit is a little wider than my other Saucony shoes, so they are a little too wide. They are supportive, but have not provided the kind of relief from foot pain I had hoped to get from them. (I am a fan of the brand over all.)Style-wise, if you have always dreamed of looking like a referee, these are the shoes for you!"
5,walking shoe,tis is the third pair of these walking shoes because I wore out the other two since I walk 45 minutes every day. they were recommended by a physical therapist as i have cervical spondylosis and spinal stenosis . I would not use any other
3,Not bad for the money,"Visual Basic is a huge subject, and most books that cover it carry a price tag of $40+. This book has chapters from other books and so, as a reprint, it was produced a lot more cheaply. It is not a book for beginners, but it is a decent reference. It has a lot of examples -- and this is the best way to go about using a programming language, anyway.I was somewhat disappointed that the dialect of VB in this book was 6.0, not 2005. But if you're not using the current compiler version that won't matter to you."
5,Great Intermediate Book for VB.NET,"This book is well written, thorough, and concise. I want to emphasize that this book is very concise; this is the reason that I loved it so much. This book minimizes redunancy and fillers. As a result, I was able to acquire approx. 2-3 times the information per page as compared to a typical programming book. If you have a moderate understanding of programming (or are at least a novice with a talent for this type of thing), then this book will give you a firm grasp on the fundamentals of VB.NET. In addition, you'll learn enough about various .NET topics to know whether more detailed studies of those topics would benefit your goals."
2,Keep looking.,This book says too little about so much. Save your money and buy a real book not a promo type book for other books.
3,works but hard to turn on,this has a very powerful vibration which is amazing but it is hard to get it to turn on and stay on. if i had the choice again and knowing the product would be like this i would have chose another one and hoped for just as powerful vibrations.
1,its was use ....,Couldnt wait to use it but when it came in a plastic bag ... It look use and had scratch marks on it ... My boyfriend look at it and said that it look use ... So he throw it in the trash ...
2,put a knot in it,"started out OK after about 15min it broke,I had nothing else but to take the bullet apart. The wires had broken off.I tied a knot in the wire at the top inside the uper half.Then soldered the wires back now it is fine.The factory needs to learn that trick.Just something to stop the pull on the wires."
5,JUST WHAT I NEEDED,JUST WHAT I NEEDED AND AT AN EXCELLENT PRICE. THIS BOOK HELPED MY 16 YEAR OLD SON TO LEARN 11TH GRADE SPANISH.
4,"Great little English dance track, but a little pricey.","A very good dance track... definitely has an English sound to it. Also sounds a little retro-80s, but gets a really 'beautiful' sound to it. If you like dance, and are willing to sport the cash... I say go for it!"
5,Trance music that feels like a love song,"I drove my boyfriend crazy playing this song over and over, but I really love this song. I am a huge fan of trance music, and this song took me away to a beautiful place as I danced on the dancefloor, and people could feel my energy from it."
5,A top trance song,"When I first heard the song I was in love! Being a true trance fan I got my hands on it as early as I could.It is beautiful, and the melody really takes you away to that special place. It reminds me of Gouryella, which I also love, but this is my definite favourite.Trance is very popular here and this song was no exception...I'm glad to see there are some US fans out there too!Anyone who really enjoyed this song could get their hands on Clubber's Guide to Trance."
5,Excellent,"Excellent product! I can manage surround sound, Xbox, TV, DVD, Everything all in one. Excellent"
2,"Kinda clunky, but fun.","I actually played ""Heavy Rain"" first, a newer game by the same company, and I fear that is why it suffers in comparison. The story line is great, and I love the multiple choice concepts, but I don't think they had worked out all the bugs yet, so you find yourself having a very difficult time navigating the controls quickly enough. To be honest, I stopped playing it because I got frustrated, but I can't get the story out of my head, so I imagine I will go back to it one of these days."
4,Different but falls short overall,"This game has a very interesting storyline which keeps players coming back to see how it turns out, but near the end some things get way too out there, and it doesn't conclude as well as it starts. The dialogue can be annoying at times, people just don't talk like they do in real life, and this affects the whole interactive movie thing the game is going for. Overall its a fun experience, but trial and error gameplay and things getting too weird near the end make this game fall short of a 5/5."
5,Fun,"I did not have to wait long to receive the game.The game is a lot of fun to play,can't wait to play it again."
3,Boring and not very innovative album,IMO this album does not bring anything new to the Lake of Tears already known music. Neither the lyrics neither the sound have anything special.
1,Ordinary Album.,"It is including one good song. Only first song.Boring and ordinary album. No new things, no new emotion.Don't buy it. I am sure f you buy it from you can boring."
4,"""Does anybody really know what time it is""?",Perfect light weight contemporary travel alarm clock. Folds very flat. Easy to work & handle. I like the sleek simple design. Enjoy it so much I now leave it on the end table next to my sofa so I can tell what time it is while watching TV/DVD. Dial has slight illumination in the dark.
2,Travel clock,"This travel alarm clock is very nice and portable. It is nice and thin o you can slip it just about anywhere and forget about it. The stand only works when you have it on a flat surface, which is really annoying when you are camping, but the good thing is when you set the alarm and close the case the clock will still go off. The thing I did not like about this clock was the setting feature for the alarm. it is small little disk on the back you turn with your finger, and you can only spin it one way, so if you miss your time by a little bit you can not back it up, you have to go all the way around again. I also noticed that this clock seems to get about 5 minutes slow a week. It has been doing that since I first received it, but I just check and update by my watch. Overall, it is a decent alarm clock, but next time I think I will go for something different."
2,Disappointed,"At first, I was thrilled with the clock--it was slim and lightweight. Instructions said that the battery provided with the clock was intended for very short-term use, which was true. The problem came when I bought a replacement battery that didn't work. I bought a second and then a third battery, neither of which worked. All batteries were the same model number as the original one provided with the clock. I contacted the seller and was told that since I'd purchased it more than 30 days prior, they would not accept a return and, furthermore, was told that batteries shouldn't be replaced because it might interfere with warranty restrictions. Go figure!"
3,Seiko Travel Alarm,"Nice large display. Easy to see in the dark. It gives accurate time, the only drawback is that the alarm setting button is too small and takes some getting used too. It also uses a button type battery.Amazon had the best deal in town. No complaints...........yet."
4,Sleek and sexy phone,"If you're tired of all the boxy boring phones, try this one! It's beautiful and really eye-catching. The handset buttons are easy-to-use & intuitively labeled. Really a great product. Only three things keep it from a 5-star rating: (1) The unit has ringer volume settings (which is always nice) but the ringer can't be turned off altogether; (2) There is no volume control for the earpiece portion of the phone; and (3) I can't get the keypad to light up on my unit. But if you're looking for a beautiful basic telephone that doesn't necessarily have all the bells and whistles, this is it."
3,"Its alright...but does NOT include most songs from the movie, not even the club scenes!","The sound quality is clear and very well mastered! I was impressed by all of the track selections. This Album is money well spent! They include some songs I have never heard before. But the clarity and quality is amazing. If you are a fan of all forms of music and truly appreciate the art of music, to include vintage; meaning old music, and the cultural diversity of music, and how some of it can truly open the door to your heart and soul…well then you will love this material. Note: this album does not include most actual songs in the movie...especially that bang'n song from the ""club scene""! I cant find that song anywhere!"
3,G!,"A few songs are exceptional, especially my favorite song from this album titled ""It's Not Right"". The songs that aren't great are generic and lackluster. Worth buying the album for the few good songs that are on there though."
4,Hot Joint,"If you a Roc fan, this CD is a must. The beats and lyrics on tracks are bangin- Freeway and Beenie light it up. It's another one............."
4,Get down or lay down!,By far the Best State Property Album. This album came out during the Roc's period of dominance and shows off the talents of some of the most talented and under rated rap artists' in the game at the time. It's Da Roc!
5,Great Movie and Soundtrack,"I really liked the both. It was like a documentary on Beanie Siegel. It may of been but do you really think Beans would be singing today if it was. The soundtrack was great with some extreme songs and the movie was great along with it all. The movie was great because of the performances and acts.If I would have to refer a same topical movie, it would be 8 Mile, a bio documentary close to the life of Eminem becoming a white rapper. Check them both out and you will enjoy it."
3,decent......,"i bought this basically cuz i liked that roc the mic joint. Most of the songs r pretty good, except for a few."
3,Real Decent album,"I was'nt going to buy it at first I thought it was going to be a bunch of new wannabes rapping just to be rapping. But let be tell you this don't sleep, Beanies new band of G's is spitting some true life stuff the average street rat can relate too. The production is laid back but yet head noddable, the tracks really put you where their lyrics want you to go. Give this one a chance more than likely you'll dig it!!"
5,Not just for girls,"I bought this for my 4 year old SON for christmas 04, yes my husband was a little leary of the pink but what fun my 4 and six year old sons have had with it they love to hook it up and watch themselves dance and sing sometimes recording sometimes not we play the cd player in the background instead of the plug in cartridges so they can hear what they want... I think it is a great toy for a boy or a girl, and what a great price!!!"
4,Perfect for a 3 year old.,"i read all the reviews and was in the middle.my 3 year old LOVES it.(take in to consideration she's 3)i paid $29.99 at Big lots,also new.i wouldnt however pay the $90 or $60. it really is limited for that price.for her though,its perfect.she loves seeing herself.A++"
4,Satisfied,"I got this toy for my daughter's 5th birthday (November '04). She loves being a ""star"" with Mom, Dad, & brother as backup! When we first opened it, we sang & recorded the whole Cheetah girls CD. That's right, you can use regular CDs or the radio for that matter so your not obligated to buy any of the cartridges made for this (which are hard to find & most of the songs we don't know anyway). Now when she has sleep overs, it keeps her and her company entertained all night. The only problem I have with this toy is the mic. It's not as loud as it should be. But you can turn the music down a couple of notches wich helps a little. Do keep in mind that it is a toy and not as high-tech as some may think. I got it at a great price (1/2 off what the stores wanted) and it was worth it. I think it's a great gift for any ""little Diva""!"
2,Not the greatest quality,"I bought this for my six year old daughter for Christmas. We played with it for about 3 hours total before the microphone broke. At first, I was sure it must be the batteries but changed those and it still didn't work. We unscrewed the mic cover and found that two little wires were not saudered where they were supposed to be. I am VERY disappointed and will be exchanging this in hopes that it was just a rare problem that won't happen again."
3,Do NOT get the accessories that Amazon Lists!,Folks- This uses only Barbie cartrages designed just for this system. They are HARD to find. Disregard the LOL-happy reviewer. Hooking up a CD player does NOT make this a true Karaoke machine... I bought this today but thinking of taking it back 'cause it seems pretty limited.
5,It Help if You actually Read the Instruction LOL!,This product allows your child to sing along with any CD;I repeat any CD!!!!(Read Your Instructions Booklet First Previous Poster LOLOLOLOL)!It says clearly in the booklet that you hook up your CD Player; which even includes the link cable( Hmmmmm...how could that previous poster not have figured that out) LOLOLOL!Anyway....it is one of the products from theBarbie Company that I actually give five stars to.I bought it for my Kids and they love it! Moms if your daughter is a Deva wanna be well...This is a great buy. Hint....wait until Christmas to save. I bought mine at Target during the Holiday Sales after Thanksgiving (...) This item is a must for slumber parties for your daughters. Five stars from this product reviewer.
2,Very Diappointing,"We thought this was the perfect gift for our five year-old. Just like the other writer, our child loves to sing, dance, and watch herself in the mirror. This had everything she liked. However, when we got it we opened it up to try it out, the interference from our neighbor's babymonitor was louder then themicrophone. What's the point if you can't hear yourself. This is what it advertises to be; a Barbie toy karaoke machine, nothing more."
3,NOT a CD player,"I just received this and am sending it back unopened. First of all it is Barbie, although I didn't notice that on the site. But more importantly it doesn't play CD's. It just uses little Barbie specific music cartridges. Most Karaoke machines do both and I guess I just assumed that this was the same. If you want to listen to the same 8 songs forever that may be OK, but it isn't what we were looking for."
2,Broken Dishes,I had to order this item 4 times to get product that was not broken. In each case the package was not marked fragile- The box was large and difficult for me to carry to post office for return. The product was nice - but handling should have been much better.
5,interesting and sometimes funny,Best book on subject. I'm intermarried and I thought he raised some crucial points that you should talk about...I also liked Jewish matters and Jewish Women speak by same author
5,Eye opening,The book totally changed my view of intermarriage. I used to know that people were against it for many stupid reasons but I never heard anything substantive. I was specifically drawn by the divorce argument - I had no idea that intermarriages ended in divorce so often. Moreso the book made a lot of sense - of course people will end up fighting over basic principles even if they don't feel strongly about them.Thank you - my life is eternally changed.
2,Another disappointment,"Once again, my Jewish Mother-in-Law sent me a book to read. I was disappointed in this book, although not as much as another book on inter-marriage, which is why I rated this book 2 stars.Mr. Kornbluth does bring up a somewhat valid point that identity is important to children, however I would question the amount of importance he gives this issue. The entire book seems to be written around the premise that there **will be** children. I found only one reference to inter-marriage without children and this was almost a throwaway comment. I am deeply disappointed in the lack of substance in the arguments presented. I doubt it would have much influence on someone who was not already in agreement with the author's thesis."
3,Good read.,I enjoyed this book. The characters are bright and vibrant. The only thing I didn't like is Rouge and Noir are first cousins!! Yuk! If you can get past that then the book is a great read..
5,Fabulous,"The Veal chops with Morels and Herb Butter Sauce, the only recipe I have made out of this book so far, is one of the great achievements of human civilization.I have enjoyed Eric Ripert's chef's tasting menu at his Le Bernadin, an intimidatingly formal restaurant where Woody Allen sat at the next table celebrating the victory in his lawsuit. Apart from the croque monsieur, the recipe to which is included at the opening of this attractive book, the veal recipe was the equal of anything on his menu, even with my feeble hands at the stove.And for a far more digestible price.May I recommend this book to those who dare to enjoy life to its fullest."
4,bedtime reading,"This book is less about recipes, more about the passion for cooking and beautiful ingredients.Ideal for people who read cookbooks for entertainment, like I like to do at bedtime"
2,Interesting vacation log for artists and a cook,"I bought this because I like Eric Ripert, but the is the second of his books that is very odd. The difference is that this one is odd by design. An artist, 2 photographers, a food writer/chef, and Ripert embark on a series of trips and cook/eat/paint/write/photograph there. The back to the kitchen concept is cute, many of the recipes are decent, but none are fantastic and none are especially relevant to the settings. We mostly learn of Ripert's likes and dislikes (he likes cured lemons and several other pantry items that probably are not in your pantry). In short, this book is not bad, but it's not a real home run on any level either."
2,Only a coffee book table,Not meant for normal people to use as a cookbook. Probably only 10% of the recipes are achievable. I can imagine it being a good cookbook for those who have been to culinary school.
1,This book is full of incorrection information. It is a complete lie.,"The Following link is the review of the book by Baabar, a Mongolian politician who actually participated in the 1990 democratic revolution of Mongolia. Baabar says ""Modern Mongolia"" by Morris Rossabi is full of incorrect information and it should not be considered as a history book but a fiction. English translation will be posted soon."
3,Pedal Tractor is disappointing,We received the tractor weeks ago. After trying to use it with much frustration because the wheel wouldn't stay on we realized that there is a broken piece. We are still trying to get the correct parts. Peg Perego has been very nice to deal with on the phone to help us correct this problem. I would not recommend ordering this item from Amazon because they will not take it back. It has been a disappointing experience.
1,The pedaling chain slips,"I am not happy with this toy as it is defective. Upon arrival, the pedaling chain slipped out of its bracket every 10 feet. After calling customer service, we were advised to take the toy bottom off and adjust the chain bracket. We actually had to bend the metal parts of the bracket to hold the chain in place. I do not recommend this toy until the defects are fixed."
3,rubber wheels,"Peg Perego John Deere Farm Tractor & Trailer is cute and fun for little guys, But the plastic wheels suck. The wheels slip on wet grass and some smooth surfaces. Instead of plastic, the manufacturer should have used rubber for the wheels for better grip."
4,Cute tractor,"My [...]son loves this tractor even though he hasn't learned how to pedal yet. It's very similar to Daddy's and he's thrilled by that alone. I wasn't sure how to rate hte educational value; I mean it's a a ride-on tractor not a book or a learninn device. The overall tractor is built well, but the trailer is sub par. The component used to keep the tractor and trailer together constantly comes off and doesn't keep the two attached well. And if you should happen to misplace the component then you're at a disadvantage. We recently upgraded to the two seater John Deere Gator (battery-powered) and both my son and [...]daughter can drive it (although my son hasn't learned how to steer just yet!). Very happy with both purchases and recommend Peg Perego John Deere equipment."
1,Wrong Toy in Box,"When we opened this toy to assemble, we discovered that the toy was not battery-powered. The box, however, was marked ""with non-spill battery"". The item on-line was advertised as battery-powered. I am very disappointed and my grandson's 3rd birthday is now diminished because he will not be getting this tractor. [...]"
3,Disappointed,Bought this for my granddaughter when she was two. She was too little at first but continued to have problems as she grew. She is now three and not heavy enough to get traction. Only one wheel spins to pull everything and most times just spins going no where.
2,Too small,I sent it back. They market it for 4 year olds but it is much too small. Beyond that it seems fine.
3,not that great ...,"Other reviewers praised this book as ""great"". Well, I will add a word of warning: beware the numerous errors! It might be helpful if you know some French grammar beforehand; then you should be able to spot most errors. However, if you are a true beginner, you may easily ""learn"" some incorrect French from this book. This is a pity, since the book is of an elementary level and was presumably written for beginning students. I did not check whether the problem is unique to the Kindle edition or is present in the printed edition as well. This review applies to the Kindle edition only."
2,I had a crush on Ian Ziering,"ANd so I bought this movie. It's terrible. It's soft core, actually, and not very good either.I actually don't own it any more, I think I gave it away.Poor guy, I wonder if he lies in bed at night and thinks, ""ugh, why did I do this movie?""I no longer have a crush on Ian. It was years ago..."
4,Fine examples of Potter's earlier works,"What can one say, if you like Potter then you will like these. Written with all of Potters quirky style and faithfully reproduced for TV, the casts are brilliantly chosen and the acting, direction and photography (or is it filming - iether way) is of the highest standard. Why not 5 ? because it leaves me with nowhere to go if and when i view or read something better. If you like Potter and you like the early English play/TV style productions you will like this."
5,Dennis Potter 3 to Remember,I purchased this set as a gift for a Dennis Potter fan who reported that he enjoyed it; I have not watched the DVDs myself.
3,Almost great,"My 1 year old loves her froggie backpack. It's cute and just the right size for her. Unfortunately the handle doesn't stay in the open position so it's constantly sliding closed when she tries to carry it along with her. If they would put a locking mechanism on the handle like with rolling luggage, I'd definitely recommend it."
3,"Helpful as far as Walkthroughs go, Terrible Errors though",Good Guide with terrible misconceptions about certain things in the game.
3,Not the greatest...,"I actually never needed this guide much. The explanations were a little confusing, and it made me wanna sell my game (which I did). Want my honest opinion? Look for some online guides. It's free and will do better."
4,Beaitiful Music good service thank you,I heaard this on Galaxy and ordered it right away. Now I can`t live without it. This is music you never get tired of.
5,Wonderful piano trios,Very refined recordings of Haydn's piano trios. Full of life and majesty. The beaux trio have done splendid job of communicating Haydn's genius.
1,Haydn: Complete Piano Trios,Bad recording - all one can hear is the piano part...too loud and is sounded liked the piano was set right next to the microphone... Wish I could return this set of CD's. Very disappointed.
5,Gift well received,"Masterfully played and a delight for Christmas Day or anytime when intelligent, classical music is desired. The #34 is especially poignant"
4,A few unexpected gems,"I got this because I'm a huge guitar hero fan and it was cheap. But I have to say there are a few tracks that I absolutely love, and It was money very well spent. That being said, the bad tracks are almost painful to listen to. The good ones more than make up for it though."
4,The Printer,"A nice story about a deaf father and a hearing son, but I was disappointed that the story is not true. Since the father and son are 'real', I would have preferred a real-life story from thier experiences. You don't have to save people from a fire to be a hero in your son's eyes."
3,Ashkenzy?,"I bought this CD as a reference as I am learning Chopin's nocturnes. I don't think Ashkenazy as that great a Chopin player. He's playing is relatively dry compared to other pianists. Take Mikhail Pletnev for example. The recording isn't too good either. All in all, this is a great CD to purchase only if your budget is limited and you're not expecting to listen to this over and over again."
5,Brilliant stuff!!!,"This compilation is worth it for Space's ""Magic Fly"" and Dee Dee Jackson's ""Automatic Lover"" alone!!! Nice to see the presence of Disco's greatest Diva Donna Summer (how can you have a Disco collection with no Donna!!!)Without a doubt, this will have you dancing all night long!!"
4,The best way to learn Office 97,"This book offers what any user needs. A hands on approach to learning. With the use of sample files to work on, downloaded from the internet, you can get going immediatley. The book is simplistic as well as complex. You can pace your learning to suit yourself and not have to worry about missing the class, your the teacher, student and most of all the one who gets the results. The results are immediate and you have a reference which you can refer to at any time.Grauer's books are what I would recommend to anyone looking for a good book that does not cost, your arm and leg to buy. The results will be just what you wanted."
5,Great Deal,"What a deal....I saved hundreds on a super Harman Kardon AVR347 Receiver. The sound is unbelievable, and lets not forget the 7.1 surround...WOW...I went back and ordered the IPod controller to complete my system.I may never leave the house again...."
4,Not Bad,"This is my second Harman Kardon AVR 347. The first brand new receiver stopped passing the video signal of my surround sound set up within 6 months. I had originally hooked up the system using component video cables since I did not have an HD television and was watching SD television. I returned the product and Harman Kardon replaced it with a refurbished AVR347. I was disappointed that it was not a new receiver since I had it for less than 6 months. I sent an email to Harman Kardon to that effect, they chose not to respond to me. I now have my surround sound connected via HDMI cables and so far the refurbish AVR347 is working well."
2,Issues with the HDMI inputs,"I had major problems with the HDMI inputs. I had a PS3 and TW cable connected to this unit via HDMI. With the cable, i had issues turning channels. The screen becomes blank (blue screen) sometimes and I have to keep in flipping thought the channels or turn the unit on and off before I get get a picture. In terms of the PS3, sometimes this unit degrades the picture quality. There are these little specs on the TV and sometimes the letters on the screen is screwed up. I'll turn the unit off then on, and sometimes it get worse. The only thing I can say positive about this unit is the sound quality is pretty good. Especially using the Multi LPCM.In terms of features, I think it is a little behind it's competitors. There are other units out there about the same price with 3 to 4 HDMI inputs and supporting DTS-HD and True-Dolby.I returned this unit and purchased a Onkyo SR705."
2,"Started very good, started failing, then died","I bought the unit less than two years ago. It started great, but then the sound stopped working on occasion when we would turn it on when associated with a video feed. We'd need to turn it off and turn it on again to get it working. That occurred about 1 year ago and nearly every time we used it. Then two weeks ago all audio stopped for the video feed. It would work for the radio but not any of the methods of getting video in and out including HDMI and component. Really sad because now at Christmas with visitors coming, I have to spend money on a new receiver. I should also note, the audio was great when it worked."
3,Not user friendly and HDMI issues,"It takes a while to set up and the manual is not too helpful in the details. HDMI output only transmits video and not audio, and this info it not in the manual. If you use HDMI connection, you can only get sound from external speakers. Remote control is not as intuitive as it should be.Update: HDMI repeater degrades image quality. Playing DVD movies on my blu ray player and connect through this receiver shows flashing red dots on the screen. The problem went away when I connect blu ray player directly to TV. Blu ray movies and HD TV also lose some clarity when connect through HDMI inputs/output of this receiver."
2,somthing's wrong,"I got my reciever on time, and well packaged, the specifications of the product were those i bought. Nevertheless the product seems old, used, and no new, like i ordered it. it's lacking of one of the letters in the mark in the upper side of the reciever. I didn't return it because i need to send it to my brother out the US and i didn't have time."
5,College Level Dictionaries,"The American Heritage College Dictionary 4th Edition, PLUS Roget's II The New Thesaurus, 3rd EditionThis dictionary will very nicely meet the needs of most readersand many writers."
4,A great guide for novice investors,"I am a novice investor and am still fairly new to this territory. Until I read this book, I didn't really have a structured investing style and wasn't sure what to look for when buying a stock. My techniques were pretty arbitrary, usually investing in stocks through word of mouth not knowing whether they were REALLY good or if it was just hype. This book practically holds your hand and shows you how the experts evaluate a stock step-by-step. Am I an expert now? No, but I have the knowledge of legends like Graham, Fisher, and Zweig to guide me along and help me make more intelligent and wise investing decisions."
4,Great Beginner's book,"The Market Gurus by John Reese and Todd Glassman is one of the first investment books I've ever read. The book is fairly easy to read and doesn't require too much prior knowledge. Each section starts with an introduction of the guru, his achievements, and a summary of his investment strategy. The strategy is then applied step by step to two companies. What I particularly like is that plenty of links to various websites as well as recommendations for other investment journals/books can be found scattered throughout the book.The problem, however, is that some gurus share similar views and it can get rather redundant. But overall it is well worth a look, even if you don't finish reading everything."
4,The Market Gurus,"The Market Gurus easily breaks down investment strategies for the new or begining investors, but has very useful information that can be used by veteran investors. This book is easy to understand for the rookie investor. The authors achieved their goal very successfully. By showing the investors of the past, it made the different strategies much clearer than it would have been to just explain them. I enjoyed this book and definetly recommend it to anyone in need of strategical advise in the stock market."
4,A Great Book For The New Kid On Stock Investing,A great book on learning about the stock market. Talks about many different types of strategies that any new upcoming investor could use. It let's you find out what kind of investor you will be by seeing what strategy fits you best. I myself like the O'Neil strategy. I would recommend this book to any who are curious about the stock market and investing in it.
1,Horrible !,"Just horrible - the most ugly - unfit - weird size you can imagine.Is greenish so no way that you can not tell is a wig, is wide but short/small - can fit a really small child with a big big head. The ""hair"" is poorest quality. A big waste of money. Is not wort it 1$. I'm sorry."
2,does not last and the 'fling it' feature? how does it work?,"Not even 10 minutes out of the package, and my dog already ripped it.Not very durable. The plastic ball with windup string inside is already coming out. my dog did enjoy it while it lasted, which was a few days.so this tail, connected to a spring loaded retractable string, what is the dog, or the human supposed to do with it? i don't get it.it is quite strong, so i was worried that my dog would pull the tail with his mouth, then holding the squirrel body in paws, and then whacking himself in the face/head when it retracts. vet bill?needs much more reinforcement inside in order to be durable and long lasting fun."
2,Fling-it Squirrel,"Although the body of the squirrel is still intact, our Pug tore the fur off the tail of the squirrel the first day he had it. He still plays with the body and there is nothing for him to choke on, but I was disappointed that it fell apart so quickly."
2,Granddog's toy,"It was totally destroyed in about 5 minutes. She is not a vicous dog, in fact the opposite. Went back to buying treats!~"
2,"don't fling it, chuck it to the trash",the squirrels tail came off within a day. My dogs hate squirrels and lost no time finding out this was fake. I couldn't really ever figure out how to throw the darn thing and I had several people try. They still play with it on the floor when I tell them to 'get the squirrel' but they are typically looking outside for a real one........
2,Easily destroyed by larger dogs,my beagle/shepherd mix got a hold of this toy for about 20 minutes trying to pull of the tail but failed miserably. after a few ingenious angles however she tore off the tail and all thats left now is the hard plasic ball that composes the body. not worth 45 minutes of dog distraction. Nice to look at though!
3,So So,This product was Ok. I thought that it was going to be a no brainer you pull the tail and let go but its not that simple and it doesn't fling across the room like I thought it was going to do. You are suppose to spin it somehow. The dogs of course loved the stuffed animal.
5,Fling it squirrel,Sturdy well made toy for my Westie...she loves it.....the fling it part works well and I can swing it around and throw it.....for the money....I think this is a great doggy toy.
1,Don't bother with this toy!,"I was extremely DISAPPOINTED with this toy. The directions basically say ""pull, twist and let go"" how hard is that??? Apparently very... I thought the toy was broken. The company sent me another one and it still did not work!!!! My dog doesn't even pay attention to it. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this item. I would recommend something else..."
1,review of flying squirrel,the thing did not work right from the beginning and now the tail fell off would not recommend it to anyone
2,poorly made,"My dog easily tore the tail and the ears off of this toy in less than 24 hours. It came apart very quickly and easily, I don't reccomend it."
5,This is a fantastic version of Schubert's Goethe lieder.,This version is one of the most beautiful. Goerne is such a good singer. But Andreas Haefliger also is an excellent pianist. I hope this duo brings out other songs.
2,"Poorly written, but containing valuable information","Well, I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about Buddhism. I did learn more, but it was painful. The information in this book is valuable and important, but the book is poorly written and, frankly, boring. I suppose that good writing is another aspect of worldliness that the authors have shunned."
3,Tiberius's view of Tiberius,"This is the reign of Tiberius as seen from his perspective. It is interesting and entertaining but really fails to follow the historical record and in general paints Tiberius as misunderstood rather than the paranoid monster he is described as in the historical accounts -- which admittedly may not have been all that accurate either. However, I enjoyed this book (as I did Augustus) and thought Massie's interpetation of some of the events might actually be plausible. I thought the early stages of his marriage to Vipsania was very plausible. The same is true of Sejanus. How and why did Tiberius trust this man and Massie's interpretation is certainly plausible.Of course keeping track of all of the characters is a challenge but that is true of the historical record as well. I only gave the book three stars because I thought some of the dialog was a little anachronistic. Still it is a good book and well worth the reading."
3,"An inferior sequel to ""Augustus""","As a book on its own, ""Tiberius"" may be an interesting book, but as a sequel to ""Augustus"" it is inferior. Several scenes from ""Augustus"" were re-played just to give Tiberius's point of view, which may be interesting psychologically, but makes the book look phony. Massie goes too far in giving a favorite view on Tiberius: he ommits Tiberius's bloody purge of Sejanus's followers, for instance. Still, the subject matter and the early part of the book make its reading worthwhile."
3,good insights yet lacking content,This book has good insights in to the new theories of depression. Braun talks about depression being caused by the sprouting of neurons instead of chemical imbalances. He also goes into the descriptions of the antidepressants and there functions. I like that he concludes that depression is more a biological problem than a psychological one. Yet he falls short on the new theories of depression. I felt like he needed to go in more detail of the new theories of depression or maybe the scientific community does not have a lot of new information about this. Futhermore I usually have read books on people that have mental illnesses and doctors that talk about depression. It was interested to get a different perspective of depression.
3,Not a bad scientific book at all for a non-scientist,"As a person who has suffered through some emotional and psychosomatic problems myself, I can appreciate both Braun's book itself and his excerpts of how he himself felt before and after starting antidepressants. It's a nice book for...dare I say laypeople? I'm not trying to get on a high horse or anything (actually I don't even have a high horse since I don't have a Ph.D. or an M.D.), but if your looking for real science in this book, don't buy it. If your Joe Schmo out there wondering why you are feeling strange mentally, and you'd rather spend $25 on a book than spend $250/yr in co-payments seeing a shrink, then this book's for you. I did really like one of Stephen's quotes comparing new antidepressants to corrective lenses, and I included it in my new book, The Failures of American Medicine, which can be purchased here at Amazon.com... Now, if you ARE looking for the real science behind mood disorders, then you know what other book to buy!"
4,Mike Wallace Lite,"Given the career of the author, I think it would have been safe to assume that we could have expected more details of the subjects that he presents in the book. What he does tell us is interesting and he certainly is one of the few people in the world who has had the opportunity to interview people of this stature which is why I gave the book four stars. It would be nice at some point if Mr. Wallace could give us a more complete version of his career and life at some point."
3,Tantalizing but superficial,"Mike Wallace certainly has some great stories to tell, but beyond the longer section on the Westmoreland and Wigan sagas, there is almost no meat on the bone here, which is disappointing since Wallace really has interviewed many of the most influential people of our times. the accompanying dvd is a great piece of history, but once again, only if you wish to condense history into forty second segments."
4,Kindle version,I always enjoyed Mike Wallace on 60 minutes the most. This is a fun book to read. Some good inside info. I don't know if there were pictures in the book but there are none in the Kindle version. I didn't see any problems with the Kindle version. I was glad it was available for the Kindle and enjoyed reading it.
2,not too comfortable,"I had horrible problems walking due to the pain in my cyatic nerve and this product did help with that but I didn't find it comfortable enough to wear all day. Sitting down cut off the circulation to my legs so I only used it when I knew I would be walking a lot. I have an even better product my OB introduced me to. It's called a Prenatal Cradle and is so comfortable that you can wear it all day. Plus according to my OB, the Loving Comfort Maternity Support was fine earlier in the pregnancy but you really need something like a Prenatal Cradle that distributes the weight onto the shoulders as well later in the pregnancy. Prenatal Cradle was a life saver for me! They are a bit expensive but [...] has the best price. I've seen them in stores or on line for upto $80 but got it from [...] for I think around $40. Well worth looking into!"
4,Excellent for Standing Up and Walking,"I got this support set at 6 months of my pregnancy and it is great for sitting for about an hour and walking around. I live in NYC. Between the subway and the bumpy high ways, I needed the belt to keep the baby still. Still using it in the third trimester."
3,Another missed opportunity,"Those of us who love the Rake keep being frustrated by new recordings--five in toto since the Eighties--in which things go hit-or-miss. There was a lot of promise here. McNair makes a very good, pure lyric anne, but then things go sour. Rolfe-Johnson is a wonderful tenor in the light English style, but he is twenty years too old for the part, and Ozawa conducts limply in many places. So far, nobody has surpassed the classic Sixties account on Sony with Stravinsky conducting a nearly perfect cast. Thank goodness we have it, since the recent recordings have turned out so disappointing: Gardiner, Chailly, Nagaon, and Craft among them."
3,Strange...,"Let's see. We have short stories about trying to navigate love in the age of AIDS. We have short stories about angry white males who blame their troubles on all the minorities. We have stories about love between a man and a man who is becoming a woman, but the man doesn't know it. I think there was supposed to be meaning in all these stories, that they were supposed to relate to each other in some way. However, I couldn't figure it out. Oh, well... It was still an okay read."
1,"These were horrible, they looked used and rusted",I would not clean a dead animal's teeth with this product. They were rusted and looked used. I ended up purchasing from another company which is much more reputible
3,Dental tools were good and sturdy,These tools were what I expected and they are pretty sturdy so I'm happy with them plus they were very reasonably priced.
3,Mozart Complete Symphonies - Philips,"As usual, the ASMF and Marriner shine through with just the right tempo and expression. Marriner will always be my conductor of choice for Mozart's symphonies, although Jeffrey Tate with the English Chamber Orchestra does rather well too. The problem I had with this set was with the latter half (what are considered Mozart's ""late"" symphonies). They are disappointing under Krips' hand because Krips' interpretation of Mozart's symphonies is draggy and lack a je ne sais quois that the other Mozartean conductors of our day possess. It would have been better if Krips had done the early symphonies and Marriner, the late, because Mozart was at his peak as a composer with his late symphonies."
2,Where's the Rest of Him?,"If a work is to be called the ""complete"" anything, does it not behoove the artist to tell the truth? Anyone familiar with sonata allegro form knows a symphonic exposition is presented twice before entering development in the first movement. It's basic introduction to music. So how come my very favorite, Number 39, is abbreviated to only one presentation of the exposition? For nearly $... I think I deserve more no matter how good the cd sounds. If it sounds incomplete, then it is incomplete. I bought Beethoven's complete by Solti and the Chicago Symphony and despite the fact that those expositions are by tradition offered only once, Solti's integrity called him to present all 9 as written. I'm no scholar nor am I a stickler. I just know what things should sound like and anything less is unsatifactory."
2,Too BORING!!,"OK, I love Mary Kate and Ashley books. But this is the worst.Nothing really makes sense, and I almost rammed my head against a wall when I tried to read it!The charecters are the same, but it's boring. Really. I've read a little more than half (non willingly) and it's just confusing and boring. Just wait for Santa Girls to come out in Dec. instead!"
2,Not for the casual historian,This book is for the serious philologist and/or linguist. Less of an explanation of early German life and language than a lecture-made-into-a-book on the evolution of a handful of words.The book assumes much more familiarity with ancient texts and dialects than the casual armchair historian will have. Lack of preexisting in-depth knowledge makes this book too ponderous and obtuse.
4,"An admirable effort, and a helpful source for Early Germanic","After struggling for some time to find some sort of connecting sources of information to build an idea of Early Germanic life. After having read this, I was able to determine ranks and the language forms that came with it in establishing a societal form for many Early German tribes. Although primarily concerned with Germanic language, it helps clear the mist from many confusing theories. Kudos!"
2,Torment,"I'm not going to knock BI, this is an awesome game, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would and actually felt that it was a bit limited as far as the games I have seen them roll onto the market. The graphics are awesome, the effects are awesome, and the storyline is great. The only complaint that I have is the character was pre-generated. I hoped that it would have been more open."
5,They dont make them like they used to,"This is one of the best RPGs ever made. Only fallout 1/2 and Baldur's gate are close to competing. The reason for Torment's incredible effect is it's dialog. The story is outright amazing. I have fond memories of spending like 4 hours wandering around the ""brothel for slating intellectual lusts"" just talking to people. The game is a work of art and plays like an intense sci-fi/fantasy novel. They had to have written at least a novel's worth of dialog.On a less positive note, the fighting is rather unchallenging. Don't expect baldur's gate or fallout like tactical gameplay. The dialog and storyline MORE than make up for the medocre fighting, and the game is not fighting heavy anyways.I patiently await the day an RPG takes dialog to the level torment did. I also morn the death of Black Isle Studios.Fallout 3 is coming out soon (after 10 years). One can hope..."
5,true freedom,"if you lik rpg's this is one of the best, and you can read the other reviews to see why. the newest feature i want to point out is true character freedom. in most rpg games you are given moral choices, but within the gaming peramaters you have to answer a certain way to win. now i perfer to play good characters, but i like the option to be ""pure evil"" once in a while. in this game you can do whatever you want and you won't be punished like in balder's gate when the towns people will attack you if you have a bad reputation. in this game no answer is wrong, some choices may be harder than others, but at least they're your choices."
5,Planescape: The realm of chaos and order,It was the best ad&d adaptation I played since 1991. Planescape is the best realm that such a story could occur. A Forgotten Realms adaptation of the same story would probably fail. It is an incredible storyline that forces the player to see what fate is expecting nameless one. It is one of the few games that I literally became the hero. Addictive! Fallout and Torment are the best RPG's i have ever played in my life!
5,WOW! Have you died yet today?,"This game is so incredible. I already played <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001QEQA/qid=951776727/sr=1-1/002-2818223-1369817"">Baldur's Gate</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004KDF9/qid=951776792/sr=1-1/002-2818223-1369817"">Fallout</a> and I would never have thought, that a RPG could get any better in the near future... but here it is! This game is keeping me out of bed! And when I find an hour or two to get some sleep, I find myself workin' out a way to get through the catacombs or how to solve some quest given to me by some weird lookin' characters... So much for Dale</a>... Hurry up Guys!"
5,Another super game from Black Isle Studios,"I can't rave enough about this game. In particular, the dialog within the party and with NPCs really raises the bar. I think it's one of the best RPG's out there. It isn't perfect -- the focus on dialog isn't optimal for replay -- but I'm happy with a game that plays GREAT the first time through.I don't have much to add to what others have said here except that:This game plays on windows NT (though the specs say it isn't supported). I played it through on a laptop using DirectX 3.0 and WinNT 4 SP-5. I didn't have sound, however, because my sound card drivers aren't directX compatible -- and you do lose part of the plot if you don't have sound."
3,Gabriel Knight3,"If you want a game with a excellent story plot with lots of twists and turns, This is is. But also be aware the puzzles and the solving of this game are about impossible without a hint book. This has to be the hardest game I have ever tried to play. I have played both G.K. 1 and 2, and they were a cake walk compared to this. But as I said the story plot is very intersting. I recommend this game if you don't mind getting the book too."
2,older game with gameplay problems,"this game gets a lot of great reviews, and i guess almost ten years ago, this game was considered cutting edge with RPGs for PCs. i only bought this game two months ago, and i feel it's only okay. the graphics are a bit bland, which creates problems because sometimes your character will have to find something in the game environment but since so much on the screen is either shadowed or looks the same, it's hard to spot important things. also, the AI can be maddeningly frustrating. you ""control"" a group of about five players, but they'll do the most ridiculous things, like running into danger, standing and simply getting hit, not attacking. this becomes a serious issue towards the end of the game when you have to fight a lot and need your characters to be on point instead of doing things which specifically gets them hurt and killed. overall, this game is okay, the storyline is okay. it's just a blah sort of game."
2,Stability problems,"I can't argue with much of the content of the reviews here. However, be aware that the character control is really poor and that's aggravating in the extreme. I have a high-end PC with lots of memory and disk and the game crashes (just leaves for the ether), on average, about once for every 3 hours of play. The game has lots of nice dialog options, character 'alignment' (good/lawful/neutral, etc.), but the problems I've mentioned make it pretty low in my estimation."
2,Dissapointing for AD&D Players,"I LOVED Baldur's gate. This game was dissapointing. It is much more geared toward role palying and you CANNOT die. That takes all the fun out of all those battles. If you are looking for a AD&D game, buy Baldur's gate or the new Icewind dale."
2,daughter wasn't impressed,"My daughter is a huge R.L.Stine fan. She loves Goosebumps. Her comments on this book was ""It wasn't very good, it's pretty boring"". I recently bought this book for her, she has put it in the box to give away to the friends of the library. My daughter doesn't depart with her books very often. I am sure there are other children who will love this book. My daughter isn't one of them. She has many Goosebumps books as well R.L.Stine books."
3,"Suspenseful, thrilling, but the ending ruins the book.","Welcome to Camp Nightmare is likely the scariest, most suspenseful Goosebumps book. The story is about a group of children who go to a summer camp, where mysterious things happen. Without ruining much, I'll say that I was on the edge of my seat throughout the book.However, the book's ending is unexpected... in a bad way. You'd expect a such a suspenseful book to have an incredible twist at the end, as Stine usually ends his Goosebumps series, but the ending to Welcome ot Camp Nightmare oozes of unoriginallity, and is a giant cop out. R.L. Stine ruined what could have been his greatest book."
2,"Good at first,horrible at last","This is about a boy named Billy who goes to Camp Nightmoon.He thinks it's pretty good.But then one night Billy's friend Jay comes back saying a monster named Sabre got Roger.After that,every time someone goes on a hike or event,someone disappers.Then Billy thinks hes got to get out of Camp Nightmoon.Very BAD and Cheesy ending.You've wasting your time if you read this book.The Tv Episode is much better than the book.I strongly reccomend you see the episode.I'm dissapointed with R.L. Stine on this book.If you like Goosebumps, you should read these books,Calling All Creeps,Beware The Snowman,It Came From Beneath The Sink or Goosebumps Series 2000 book Earth Geeks Must Go!"
3,This is one of the best books I ever read.,Welcome to camp Nightmare is about a guy named Billy who went to camp. Then every once in a while kids start disappearing. Read this book to find out what happens to the kids that disappeared and if Billy will disappear to?
1,BOO!!!,The book sucked big time when i read the book i thought it was awaste of money . R.l stine rocks but this book sucks itshorrorible . Dont get.!!! From Matthew Gargano.Ps other rl stine books are better.
1,wrong item,"I ordered this movie, anticipating enjoying it, based on the stars and eminent director. I was shipped a PAL version, a format used in Europe and not playable in the US. I sent it back and requested an exchange for the proper version, NTSC. No exchange as requested. I was refunded the sale price but not the shipping, which they charged to send it to me, and which I paid to return it to them. It was their mistake; I think I should be refunded the 2-way shipping."
4,One of the best cordless phones ever owned,"The mere concept of a cordless speaker phone is incredible, and who would've thought Sanyo could do it! Anyway, the speakerphone part itself isn't 100% great, but it is very cool to use when on hold or something. Otherwise as a regular phone, the 900mhz DSS was so much better than my 2.4ghz I returned cuz it had such crappy reception. Anyways, this phones got my vote. Had it for over a year and can walk down the block with little breakup."
2,maybe it's just not a city phone...,"Everyone I called with this phone either complained about the bad connection or how echoey and strange my voice sounded. Actually, the phone sounded echoey to me too a bit when talking on it. Perhaps because of the speakerphone? Also, during every conversation I had with the phone, strange interference and drop outs abounded every few minutes. But I really liked the speaker-in-handset function so much that I didn't want to give it up. As recommended in the instruction manual, I tried it in several locations throughout my apartment, always with the same results. Finally, I gave up and returned the phone. Maybe it failed because I live in an apartment building in NYC?"
1,Lots of noise and static,"Im returning the phone. Its possible the city setting has to do with it, but the quality of the reception on this phone is awful. Not only do I get the echo, but I also get static noise at certain places. Ive moved the base and handset around to different positions, but nothing helps much. And now I have to pay for shipping... nothing against amazon, but its probably not a good idea to buy electronics you havent tried out, because you inevitably have to deal with the extra shipping costs and hassle."
4,Better then I thought,"So the graphics arent that great, but if your are just looking for that you need to pick a different sport. All the things that this game offers makes it one of the best games that you can buy. It is just like watching Sunday Night Baseball, except you are interactive with it. Plus it is updated, like A-Rod in pinstripes. I would certainly advise you to pick this game over any other."
4,Homerun! And it's also really good.,"I played MVP for a week and quickly gave up on it when i got my hands on ESPN Major League Baseball. This game is really terrific. Pitching, hitting, fielding - it's all good. Really good. Gameplay is rock solid. I haven't put this game down in about 7 days. Oh and it's online too. EA should probably work on getting MVP online ;)"
2,MVP is better,"I bought this game first because I have been buying all of their games. Unfortunately this was my first dissappointment. Compared to MVP, ESPN isn't much fun. I would recommend MVP."
1,terrible,"this game was a complete dissapointment. last years one was pretty good and realistic. but this year it got worse. the graphics are only average, controls are bad, and animations are unrealistic. almost any pitch you throw in the zone is a homerun against the good hitters. i can hit 4 homeruns in one game with one player and not even have to try hard. dont even rent this game. its NOT worth it."
5,Is it coming out on 4/13/04,"I have been waiting for this game to come out for so long! and now I am two days away from getting it. I have seen many screenshots, videos, and more! I have ESPN Football and that is the best football game around with first person view! From the videos i have seen it is the same thing except it is baseball! When i called gamestop to see if they were getting it in on the 13th and they said that it was coming outon the 5th of may. Except on there website it says the 13th of april and so does all the other sites so i am believing that it is coming out on the 13th! Also i am MAD that xbox got it first!!!Well we will just have to see.~bye~"
3,Dalla Sede,"""Ce n'e' "" potrebbe valere almeno meta' del prezzo da sola. Uno dei classici dell'(ora defunto?) HipHop italiano."
5,Works Great For Me,"This bag fits my 21"" frame well leaving enough room for a bottle holder. I have had it for a month now and it has held up well. I am able to carry tools, an extra tube, and a big heavyduty U-bolt lock with room left over for whatever I have in my pockets. The bag holds a narrow profile staying out of the way. The bag looks sharp completing my bikes appearance. The reflective stripe along the left side is very visable at night.Cons....Wish it had a reflective stripe on both sides and some kind of locking feature."
5,Awesome product!,"I LOVE this cover! I was amazed that Amazon could ship such a huge parcel for free, so another bonus! Easy installation, excellent craftsmanship! Our pick-up bed is bone-dry and the only problem came in getting a lock for the tailgate because of GMC. FYI, the cover will be 1/4 inch too long if you have a bed liner so you'll have to get the bed liner cut for a proper fit."
2,MADE IN CHINA - Not typical Godinger LEAD Crystal,"It is pretty, but does not shine like real LEAD CRYSTAL.Although the product description does not say 24% Lead Crystal, I was expecting this to be like other Godinger Crystal - which is 24% Lead Crystal, made in Czeck Republic or Poland.I ordered this to replace an identical vase that broke. I compared the box from my original vase to this one. I was disappointed. It is pretty, but not the quality crystal I expected.My Original VaseBox States: Godinger 24% Lead Crystal, Made in Czeck RepublicThis Replacement VaseBox States: Godinger Crystal Vase, Made in CHINALesson learned - if it doesn't say it, don't expect it."
4,PRETTY FOR THE PRICE,"I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY SONS' 3RD WEDDING ANNIVERSARY. THIS WAS MAILED SO I HAVEN'T SEEN THE ITEM BUT MY SONS AND DAUGHTER SAID IT IS VERY PRETTY, HAS NICE WEIGHT TO IT AND IS VERY ATTRACTIVE. MY ONLY COMPLAINT WOULD BE THAT IT WAS SHIPPED 3 TIMES BECAUSE EACH TIME IT WAS RECEIVED BROKEN. MY SON SAID IT WAS NOT WRAPPED IN ANY KIND OF BUBBLE WRAP OR WRAPPED IN ANY WAY AND JUST PLACED IN THE BOX? THEY DID RE-SHIP FOR ME SO I AM HAPPY FOR THAT."
4,THE VCA CAMP,I THINK LORD SUPREME IS THE BOMB. HE REMINDS ME OF MASTER P.I HAVE MY OWN PERSONAL COPY OF THE VCA CAMP AND I LOVE IT.
3,One of many similar trailer videos,"If you don't owna Bond trailer video, then it is worth the purchase. If you already have a compilation of trailers from Dr. No to A View To A Kill, then save your money. It appears that these trailers get repackaged over and over with little variance in the presentation."
1,Poor quality video of James Bond movie trailers.,"This video features the trailers of the James Bond movies from ""Dr. No"" to ""A View to a Kill,"" minus ""Never Say Never Again."" There is a brief shot of the movie posters of ""Licence to Kill"" and ""Goldeneye"" at the end. The quality of the video is poor. No attempt has been made to enhance the color, sound quality or sharpness of the original trailers. Additionally, the copy I received had poor tracking and annoying ""jumping"" of the picture in several of the trailers. A rip-off."
3,Not a bad batting aide but not perfect,"This does the job it should, i.e. providing the ability to tell the batter if he or she is driving the ball or popping it up. It is not the best design, however. It works by wrapping and unwrapping from the pole. Smaller athletes have a hard time spinning it onto the pole such that it delivers a 'pitch' of good speed at the height you pre-set. It also has a folding handle on it to help move it from place to place, but the handle doesn't fold far enough out of the way for smaller athletes that have to set the swing level as low as possible and that causes the lower ball line to catch on the handle. I can get on it and use it fine, but it is still not the best one out there. I prefer the rubber band loaded version that is now out. It is similar to one i used 30 years ago and delivers a better 'pitch' and better feedback on the quality of your contact."
2,Junk Plain and Simple,"I bought this for my 8 year old to practice hitting. Although well built, it is poorly designed. The place where the Hit a Way attaches is not logical and causes interference with the legs. The cables on the Hit a Way are so stiff that the ball loses velocity quickly and does not wrap and come back around for the 2nd hit. You might get one or two hits in before it is unusable. A GIANT waste of money. The only reason I give it 2 stars is the construction is solid."
2,If Not For The Feel.......,"As a jazz guitarist you always listen for what you can learn from someone, what they do well and not well. Russell is an amazing talent when it comes to chord melody playing. His voicings, along with slick tricks using harmonics makes for a beautiful addition to the standard approach to playing jazz guitar chord melody. What makes this CD difficult to listen to is his playing in time or with the rhythm section. His lines are mostly un inventive and have a very awkward feel. It does not have the feel of say, Grant Green or George Benson. It sounds as if his picking is not worked out well and subtracts from the over all rhythmic feel of the music. I would love to hear a record of just solo guitar from this artist!"
4,Gardiner's Choral Conducting,Though I have not myself heard Mr. Shaw's recording I can still give my honest opinion of Gardiner's recording of these Schubert works. All of these pieces came alive in very distinct ways. Gardiner masterfully understands the path of the musical phrase and follows it very faithfully to the intent of the composer. As usual the Monteverdi Choir is perfect in unison and seamless in transition. Especially in 'Gesang der Geister' does the mellow sound of the low strings combine with the male voices for a very introspective sound. This recording is very important to have--you are unlikely to find this collection recorded very often elsewhere.
2,Get Shaw instead,"Although it is nice to have access to some of these seldom-heard pieces on a major label, I find that Gardiner's conducting, as well as the singing, is irrevocably mannered and shrill. His tempos make no sense in terms of what's going on in the score, and some of the choral ""effects"" he gets from the singers are absurd. This is a repertory that is sore need of rediscovery, so it's nice to have a choice in recordings. But the Shaw disc (Schubert Songs for Male Chorus) is light years agead of this one, with sensitive tempos and truly nuanced singing: i.e. rich, adult voices versus Gardiner's shrill boy-choir sound."
2,A disappointing recording from a splendid singer,"After reading the rather rude review of this CD, I was ready to rush to Emma Kirkby's defence, but I thought maybe I should listen to it first before passing judgement. Unfortunately I must conclude that this isn't a good CD for fans of Kirkby or Beach. Emma Kirkby's repertoire covers a huge section of musical history from the 12th to the 18th century, but this is the first recording I have ever heard where she sings later music. So many fans and critics have suggested that she sing something more modern, and it would appear that this is her answer to them. The earlier virtues of clarity and control counted for little with the romantics, and her voice seems so out of place here. Listen to her singing Bach, Dowland, Monteverdi, De Machaut or Handel, but don't listen to this CD. But everyone makes mistakes sometimes - even the Eagles had the Long Run."
4,Wrong DVD was in the case,"I am sure this DVD is excellent, but we are buying a used video of this item from eBay instead, as the DVD that was in the case when we purchased the New Dimensions for Bass ""new"" from Amazon was Steve Bailey & Victor Wooten Bass Extremes Live. It turns out that DVD is good too, so we're not returning it, but either Amazon or their supplier are sending out the wrong item in this DVD box at this time. Which is unusual for Amazon and unfortunate, as Doug Wimbish is awesome and deserves to have his DVD available."
4,"Very nice, keeps the shower clean","We keep it in our shower and wipe down the glass when we're done using it for the day. I think it's really helped to keep the glass looking clean (it helps that we paid ""out the wazoo"" for the glass). DO NOT use it on tile and other rough surfaces unless you like burning money. It will get moldy readily due to the close spaces between the blades, but it does clean up nicely in the dishwasher in the ""silver"" drawer."
1,High ratings are questionable - product is substandard,Bought this squeegee to compliment a new custom bath & shower we had just finished that included an expensive frameless glass shower surround. I am very suspicious of the high ratings I see associated with this product. It is a lousy product. The blades are very rigid and do a rediculously poor job of cleaning the glass. My wife had actually purchased a cheap $3.00 squeege from Walmart to use until this one arrived. After giving this Cleret squeegee a fair shake for a few weeks we tossed it in the trash as we were tired of the streaks it left on the glass. We now just use the cheap $3.00 one from Walmart which had nice soft blages like a windsheild wiper. Sorry but this Cleret squeegee is a real peice of junk and not worth one tenth of what they are charging for it.
2,I don't like it.,"It is too stiff. I wanted a more flexable squeegee with a wider blade. I will be sending it back. The ""handle"" is large but awkward to use. You can only use your fingers to guide it, you can't use the palm of your hand with it."
2,overpriced overrated squeegee,This was advertized as the world's best shower squeegee but it is only average. It is not especially comfortable to hold while applying. Over time soap scum builds up on the blades and handle. I found a much cheaper model at Bed Bath and Beyond does a much better job.
3,"A Carter, Not a Ford","This is a good book for those of us who still cannot decide exactly how they should feel about James Earl Carter. Actually, after reading this book, I am still somewhat undecided, but at least this makes me remember all the reasons I didn't vote for Carter in 1980. I still consider myself a yellow dog democrat, but its hard to imagine anything happening in November 1980 other than Carter losing and Reagan winning. In fact, all this time later, its hard to imagine that Carter even existed. So this book is an enjoyable reminder of the good points and the aggravating points of the Man from Plains."
4,Response to critical reviewer,"I believe that most of the other reviews reflect my opinion of the book, and the man. While he has his flaws, ego not being the least of them, he has done more in his post-presidency than virtually any other individual who has held that office in the last century. What I would like to point out, however, is that the one very negative review below has false or grossly misleading statements in it. Far from supporting Daniel Ortega, Jimmy Carter was the person who persuaded the former President and Sandinista leader to concede his electoral defeat, very likely averting a civil war. Almost every scholar and political analyst will tell you that Carter also helped avert a potentially devastating war on the Korean Peninsula by his travel there in 1994. I suspect that many leaders, while they may be reluctant to admit it, take his advice deadly seriously."
4,Jimmy Carter Revisited,"This book is a perfect example of the phrase ""only time will tell."" Only now are people beginning to see what sort of a president Jimmy Carter really was. I was too young during the Carter administration to understand what sort of presidency he had. This book gave me the opportunity to see the aftermath of Carter's presidency and his activities as a citizen. Although the writing is sometimes a bit dry and wordy, the information is fascinating and presents Jimmy Carter as the multifaceted and intriguing individual that he is. It's too bad that it took us this long to discover his value."
5,> > > > Destined to be a classic book in its field.,"The authors have written a fine book on the potential, execution and practicality of Grid or Utility Computing. It is large ( 400 pages ) and well written book, technically accurate and blends well with other industry strategies such as on demand and Autonomic Computing. The chapters on open standards are particularly strong, well thought out and presented. The book is designed well and book production, diagrams, layout is nothing short of highest quality - in short, excellent.The prospect of true utility computing is within reach and technically feasible. The authors bring together best deployment practices, practical guidance on integrating existing resources, and applicable case studies. This book goes a long way to assisting that projection and should become a classic standard in the field.Full kudos~! - and a doff of the hat to both authors."
3,Too wordy and has a heavy IBM bias.,"The writing style is too wordy and reiterates too often. It would be better to have less repetition and more useful summaries at the end of each chapter.There are several references to IBM's leadership in grid computing, which seems unnecessary. Furthermore, there is no mention of the Plan 9 operating system which solved many of the problems that Globus is attempting to solve.It starts to get technical around chapter 5. So if you already know you want something resembling a grid, start there."
1,Fire Hazard,"Just some long term input on this device. It sounds great when it works. I've had mine for three years and it died on me twice. Th first time it would not turn on. The second time was much worse, the replacement I received caught on fire just by turning it on. there was no dust, I don't have any animals and no outside influences that would have affected it. It had been off all day and was 73 degrees in my place. I took a peek with a flashlight through the vents and found that the old parts not replaced were what failed on the rma device. All of the capacitors on on the old pats literally blew up. I would not buy this item."
2,HDMI has issues,"On the second one of theses in less than a year. When using two HDMi sources, receiver can't handle having them both plugged in at the same time. Works fine to begin with but for some reason at some point It just won't work with two sources plugged in. Right now I have to pull the unused source cable because. Both receivers have the same problem."
2,Harmon Kardon AVR 247,"I have this Harmon Kardon AVR 247 for a couple of months now, replacing my Onkyo DS575X which died(Amp)after 8.9 years of great service. I have a Laptop that has Harmon Kardon speakers plus sub-woofer, They have a great sound, very good. After reading other peoples reviews I bought a Refurbished HK AVR 247. I am very dissapointed with this unit, the switching from one input to another is not very good,(the display flickers,then finally switches input) as it was with my Onkyo, also the CPU has shut down four(4)times, leaving me with no picture on my TV, very annoying. you must reset the CPU, loosing all your Input settings, and having to put everything back in is a pain. HK tech support is no help either, should have bought a Onkyo!! DE"
5,Great midrange receiver,"Great sound and power to burn, even at 50w per channel. Harman Kardon is well known for their marriage of tone and power, and this receiver delivers on that promise. Bright and distinct high end, clear and robust mids, and punchy, clean bass. Most of the lower rated reviews here knock the user friendliness of the receiver. But people, don't leave the comfortable confines of entry-level receivers unless you're willing to spend some time learning to operate your purchase. Very happy with this receiver. Sounds great. Looks sharp too."
4,A beginners response,"Being an electronic-challenged person, I feel this system is pretty good. I did have help installing it. The remote is very user friendly. The only problem encountered is when we change TV channels through the receiver there seems to be a delay in receiving the signal. Balancing the speakers was a cinch with the little microphone setup."
4,Trial Run,"I bought the HL 247 this past weekend at Best Buy on kind of a whim. I was looking to upgrade our existing Pioneer receiver, but was going to wait; that is until I was BB this weekend. So far so good, but a couple of things that I've seen here raise a few questions. I'm going to have to go back to the store and get some clarification on a few items.....The 247 is matched with the Sony Bravia XBR4 52"", Panasonic Bluray DVD, a basic Sony VCR and Philips HDMI cables. The speakers are the existing Pioneer speakers that were part of the original system and they sound better with the HK than they did with the Pioneer receiver.Albeit a little cumbersome to hook up, especially with all the available input options, it's finally up and running and doing what I expected it to. It's only been a couple of days, but like I said earlier, so far so good."
3,complicated and I guess it sounds OK,I chose a HK because sound is critical to me more so than the video stuff but it has a very cumbersom interface that you see onscreen after working out the dredful instructions - I suppose the sound is good but it is hard to tell becuase configuring the speakers is difficult too.I now wish I could have gotten a different one but what to do sigh:(
3,Sounds great but not user friendly.,"I bought this from best buy to upgrade from my Onkyo 501. The upconversion to 720p from my Sony 480p dvd player is great with the video processing. Sound is clear. Power is good. Could not get my multiroom speakers to work properly after checking all connections, the manual. My 200 dollar onkyo receiver sounds just as good. Everything was automatic. The onkyo has A and B connections for an extra pair of speakers and work perfectly. I only wanted to upgrade because I had a HK avr40 which I loved and had a best buy gift card to spend. I took it back and will wait for a more user friendly receiver."
4,west u Houston,Great product for the price beats all others in connecting to other sources have to get $500+ to find better receiver
4,"Harmon Kardon ""Means Quality""","The Harmon Kardon AVR 247 has been nothing short of fantastic. Easy to setup, and even more easy to understand. I love this product, and would certainly recommend."
4,HK receiver,"My only complaint is that it doesn't seem to have a built in phono pre-amp (there's a separate amp for all eight speakers, but no phono amp?). Other than that it's an incredible piece of scientific equipment. It has a mic that you can place where your listen, and it runs a test pattern to locate the eight speakers and adjust the surround sound accordingly. The on-screen menu is nice for setting up the inpute. The defaults were frustrating until I got that connected - HDMI worked best for linking it to the TV."
2,An uneven collection,"I've listened to this set for years and never got into them, never enjoyed them, never was thrilled by them...thought that it was Brahms's fault!Once I found the DG complete Chamber set used, I picked it up and actually fell in love with Brahms again!The two sets are worlds apart! The Philips recordings are marked by dim and dry sound, while the DG is bright and fresh all the way through. The performances on the Philips are pretty well all not very inspired and energetic, (except the Cello Sonatas) while on the DG you feel like you want to keep listening over and over again!For the love of Brahms, get the DG set instead!"
2,"Kinda Close, but no Cigar","For the money spent, I think this collection of recordings is less than inspiring. The Horn Trio is weak, and Quartetto Italiano's recordings of Op.51 are not only poor in tone, but also filled with recording noise. The overall colorless nature of the recordings makes such an investment questionable at best."
5,This makes me smile everyday,"This calendar makes me smile whenever I look at it. I keep it at my desk and people are always asking me about it. It's just the right size to fit on a cubicle wall or anywhere that space is limited. The pictures are good quality and a delight to look at when I need a ""warm & fuzzy moment"" in my day.It also makes a nice gift. People really like it."
1,bowman will turn trinitarians into atheists with this work.,"the one star rating was only because the scale didnt go negative.AGAIN, piss poor scholar ship, very poor argumentation presented here. This man seems to want to make a name/living for himself off ""coat tailing"" the Jehovah's Witnesses. He has been proved to use logical fallacy's more times by Jehovah's Witnesses then I am sure he would even CARE TO RECOGNIZE. IF Rob would have spent half the time studying evangelical doctrine, then he does studying JW's he might even get respected within his own camp. S A V E - Y O U R- M O N E Y . There are better choices out there. The Bowman Stafford Debate removed any and all credibility this man thinks he may have had at one point in time."
1,Why you should not believe in this book,"Mr. Bowman, the author of Why you Should Believe in the Trinity, does not seem to have a well rounded knowledge of 1)History 2)Bible 3)Theology 4)Logic. He should have studied for a few more years before he let his emotions get the best of him. Mr. Bowman has gone on a tangent in his ignorance and pays no attention to historical or biblical facts."
1,Not based on Scripture,"I read your book Mr.Bowman and I'll say it didn't make any sense to me, where on the other hand, I just read through the brochure, ""Should You believe in the Trinity,"" and it made perfect sense. I checked some of the quotes that were listed in the brochure and they were true to form and accurate, so shame on whoever says the quotes are wrong and I'm sorry, but shame on you Mr. Bowman for knocking down other religions. I'm a college student studing other religions.Mrs.X"
2,"Satisfactory, but not the best. . .","While 2 CDs for the price of 1 is rather tempting, and a low-cost way to be introduced to the piano concertos, Ashkenazy does little more than play the notes. If any feeling is present at all in his playing, it would be best suited for playing Romantic music. His interpretation totally lacks the fire needed for Prokofiev. I would recommend the complete set of recordings played by Berman and Guiterrez on Chandos, or, if you can hunt them down, the recording of Prokofiev himself playing for the Third, and Baloghova, an unknown Czech pianist whom I have been unable to find any information about, playing the Second."
3,Music fan/July2/2003 and John Coughlin's revviews,"I totally agree with these 2 reviewsI believe the fault here lies more with Previn, and thus holds back Ashkenazy ""somewhat"", as Ashkenazy is not stellar as one would expect., There are some high points, but overall I strongly agree with A Music Fans recommend of Krainev, the finest set on record.Yes I've heard all avaliable recordings in comparison.If you like this set then OBVIOUSLY you will vote on my review as follows:, no this review was not helpfulBut at least I'm truthful, w/o the hype.Besides I've heard all the avaliable, while others that promote this set has not."
1,"Fingers, fingers...","Well, may be I can give one more star for his technique...After all he did learn all the 5 concertos. But what is the point? I have to admit that his first recording of complete Chopin etudes, when he recorded all of them on one breath, is amazing. But lately I feel like he's lost passion for music. Only technique, only fingers and NO heart whatsoever. Oh well...But if you want to remember the performance, listen to Vladimir Krainev! Trust me on this one!!! I know what I am talking about. Sometimes quantity does not make the quality better."
3,19th century Prokofiev,"This 2 CD set was a favorite of mine since 1990, however after listening to the Guiterrez and Berman recording on the Chandos label, I am going to retire this recording.The best concertos recorded here are the 1ST and 3RD. They are more lyrical and romantic sounding than the versions on the Chandos set, and so they are fun to listen to as an alternate interpretation. Ashkenazy's lyrical style and Previn's slower tempo does not work at all for the remaining concerti however (2,4,5). In fact, I did not care for concertos 2,4 & 5 (and thought it was the music I didn't care for.) until I heard the Chandos recording."
3,Not impressed,"I have bought sweatbands for $1.99 that worked as well,not only that, they lasted through more washings. One good thing I can say about the UA Headbands is...they are very comfortable, especially under my bicycle helmet."
5,LAst a long time,"Unlike other's, these seem to hold up great and don't stretch out after washing a few times. Worth the few extra pennies."
3,Works as described,Not anything special...its very warm in our area so it does have to work pretty hard. Not really anything special but it does seem to hold a good bit of sweat.
4,Thick Headband,"Bought this headband to go running in to match my college's school colors. Unfortunately this band is a little thick and halfway prevent the top of my mane from flowing in the wind, which personally like the feel of."
1,Threw it out after one workout.,"This sweatband is absolutely horrible. I was worried that it wouldn't absorb well because it was made of poly, but figured, what the heck, it's Underarmour - they must have figured it out. WRONG. During my workout, I was shedding water all over the floor. It was literally worse than not wearing a sweatband at all. On my way out of the gym, I chucked it right in the can. NEXT!"
5,A Christmas gift,Grandson also wanted this and once he opened it he couldn't make up his mind whether to wear it or the Mantis...BIG decision for a teenager! LOL! He love it!
3,No sweat headband,"Great product and fairly quick shipping. Does exactly what one would expect a sweatband to do - but I gave it only three stars due to the cost of shipping. The shipping was actually a bit more than the cost of the headband! Rather silly, especially since it is such a small item."
1,Terrible Headband,"I have tried a lot of different headbands for tennis as I play 3-4 times a week and sweat profusely. I was excited about Under Armour as I have had good luck with its products in the past. The UA headband was a major disappointment. It was not nearly as absorbent as many cheaper brands and it was ridiculously tight (and I am not a big headed person, just normal hat size). I would not recommend this headband for anyone who perspires a lot and who has anything but a tiny pinhead. I ended up throwing it away after maybe 4 wearings."
4,Great product - but pricey with shipping costs.,"Finally a headband that will fit my husband's large head. He works construction and used to wear headbands that gave him a headache. He loves these. I would have given 5 stars except for paying the shipping costs made them a little expensive. Still, all in all, would purchase again."
3,Black Under Armour headband,"I bought this headband because I sweat a lot from my head while I'm working. Although its better than nothing, it really doesn't wick the sweat away from my head like they say it does."
1,Very bad customer service.,"I placed the order on June 20th, it is July 28th and I haven't seen it yet. It says on my account ""shipping soon"". But of course it was like that since June 21st. I called five different times and talked with five polite customer service people. Each one of them assured me that it was shipping soon because now they have it in the warehouse. The last one, promised me that they were going to upgrade it to premium shipping ofr I have waited too long. Today, they told me that it is shipped (I don't see that on my account yet) by UPS ground. The promised premium shipping is gone. I wouldn't care for that, if they truly have shipped this thing. I have been a customer of Amazon since the begining.... sadly, this will be the last item I will have ordered. I have already started buying my books from the local Barnes and Noble stores."
4,The Real Deal....,"A really good cd with a lot of substance behind each song. Vocals are excellent with very good & catchy phrasing on the lyrics. Something here for everyone. Everytime I listen to it, I hear another song that will be my favorite. This is a cd that you'll play over and over again. My only criticism is there is no info on the other musicians or if this was all done by Teddy Jack himself. A little hint of Leon Russell on keyboards.The music is definitely something you'll enjoy living with.Sue Few"
1,A fifth from hell,"Hands down, the worst 5th ever(well, Norrington, Weller, and Leinsdorf have had slight worse but it is a toss-up). Rarely has the opening 4 note motif sound so rhythmically lifeless. The second movement is the worse, drawn out tempos, ornated dynamics and an unbearable Wagnerian arch to the flow. THe 3rd and 4th movements are actually quite good, but the horrid first half of the symphony makes a dud out of this piece."
2,"Terrible Fifth, good Seventh","Thielemann's approach to the Fifth is similar to that of a public speaker who realizes he is losing his audience, and begins to shout every sentence in a desperate attempt to regain their attention. The performance has no flow and no beauty, just incessant banging. He warms up in the Seventh, and gives one of the better performances on records. It's not one of the truly outstanding performances (those, in my opinion, are by Walter, Solti, Muti, and perhaps Monteux), because the music does not soar or burn with excitement as it does for those conductors. But this Seventh is a performance you can definitely live with."
1,Retarded pacing,"I heard the 5th symphony from this disk on the radio. (I'm glad I did not waste my money on it.) The pace is generally lethargic (with a precious few bright spots). Another reviewer noted this for the opening. My favorite part of the symphony was ruined -- the transition from the 3rd to 4th movement.Perhaps because of the pacing, the orcehstra was not really together either.The conductor took extreme retards that take the life out of the music. Even Mazell (known for ponderous pace) is sprightly compared to Thielemann. Much better is the recording with Dohnányi and the Cleveland OrchestraBeethoven: Symphonies No. 5 & No. 7."
1,Plodding and Lifeless,"What is most amazing about this recording is that Deutsche Grammophon allowed it to be released. This is arguably the worst performances of these magnificent symphonies that I have ever heard, and I've heard a whole bunch of them. It really doesn't rate even one star. The 7th does fair better than the 5th, but both are still unacceptable. They are well recorded however, and you can clearly hear every plodding and lifeless bar of them. I threw my copy away."
2,Very subjective Beethoven.,"A Furtwanglerian interpretation, full of unorthodox tempi and unnecessary breadth. Very fussy and mannered. Definitely not a first choice. Although Thielemann's control of the orchestra is admirable and the recorded sound is excellent, he manages to purge most of the intensity and excitement out of these 2 warhorses. An amazing achievement, in that respect. Most listeners would be better served by the classic Kleiber recording or any of Karajan's multiple versions."
2,ponderous,"Ben Zander's Beethoven and only his competes with Toscanini's. Zander's tempos are even more as Beethoven directed than are Toscanini's, but they share the passionate equality of ""masculine"" - aggressive and ""feminine"" - lyrical elements. Most performances - including these -- get passive and wimpy during the lyrical sections. I returned to listen to this recording having read glowing reports of Thielemann's Wagner to see if it could be the same conductor. I see glowing reports here, too. Yuck."
4,Welcome information,"The book was informative and easy to understand. The author seemed sensitive to the suffering of patients with sleep disorders. He seemed like the answer to long suffering. The information from the book filled in the gaps for question I've had for many years. I was so excited I decided to look up Dr.Hirshkowitz for consultation. After two over night sleep studies, Dr. Hirshkowitz is nowhere to be found,no consultation. The clinic's push is to purchase a sleep machine."
4,Sleep apnea made easy,The book is very informative on sleep disorders. I purchased this book because my wife has sleep apnea. It contains much information on the causes and problems associated with sleep disorders. It has helped my wife understand the condition alot better than she did before reading it. I would recommend it to those who have this condition and who don't understand what it is.
4,good item,good item good price cant say now if its effective or not may be after i or 2 months hope to say that its healthy too.
2,Vitamin C should not be a capsule,"I think Vitamin C should be sub-lingual not the capsule, and I think it should have the smell of fruits or citrus."
1,Horse tablets,Would have found something else if I had known how big these caps are. Couldn't care less about the other b/s they put in them beside vitamin C.
5,"Good price + good ""bioflavonoids"" bonus","It's pretty hard to know exactly how well vitamins are working for you; they don't tend to produce noticeable effects that make it obvious that Brand A vitamins are better than Brand B vitamins. But I can tell you that I notice the difference in my overall energy levels and mental acuity when my normal routine gets disrupted and I fail to take my normal pills after breakfast (multivitamin + Nature's Way Vitamin C + fish oil). Of course, I can't isolate the effects of any particular one of these pills, but I feel slower and less vigorous when I don't take these vitamins.Aside from that, there's the simple fact that these Vitamin C pills are competitively priced and also include bioflavonoids, which are powerful antioxidants that one can never have too much of. I recommend this product unhesitatingly."
1,Disappointed.,"The profoundly poor reproductions in this book, most especially the few color ones, are awful - the colors are incorrect, sallow, grainy and make the Russians all look as if they are ill and dying! The publisher should be ashamed of this pitiful production. What an insult to one of Russian's great painters!"
2,Not worth the money,"You spend months with the pregnant belly, you really look forward to being unpregnant again, only to realize you'll have a few more months or more with that saggy belly.. so this would really appeal to any mom or mom-to-be. When I bought mine at first I liked it. Wore it under a dress and it helped smooth out my belly, then wore it under a shirt and went out. After a few hours with it on moving around, sitting down, walking, etc. it would bunch up in areas and become uncomfortable. I would have kept it if it was $10 or less, but at $22 I returned it and bought some more dipes! It's worth a shot, but hang on to that receipt incase it's uncomfortable for you too."
4,Helpful,I found that the Post Partum Support belt was helpful in minimizing my pain after my c-section. I could walk a lot easier and with very minimal pain when I wore the support belt. I didn't wear it long but I thought it was worth the cost even if I did only wear it a couple weeks. I found it comfortable. It did not itch or hurt like I thought it might. I would recommend this product especially after a c-section. It did not affect my incision either which I was concerned about. It worked great for me but again I did not use it very long.
5,"Local History Book - Nevada County, CA","I'm not sure that everyone would have motivation to buy this book, but given that it details our Nevada County Narrow Gauge Railroad (NCNG), it is defiantly needed in our home library."
5,I use this in my classroom,"I teach a communications class to high school freshmen. It's a great video, very concise. It can be hard to keep the attention of a 15 year old, but this video does just that."
5,Andy Williams,"This is another Andy Williams album at his very best in the 1970s. You get two albums on this cd for the price of one. Can't beat that. There are some really beautiful songs on the ""Raindrops"" album especially."
2,Senzatempo,"This album is somewhat disappointing for a ""Timoria Best Of"" album. I recommend the Timoria albums ""2020 Speedball"" and ""Viaggio Senza Vento"" in that order. These albums have a better mix of acoustic guitar songs and songs with gratuitously heavy guitar riffs and the songs are catchier in general."
2,You might want to 'forget' this book...,"Matt takes advantage of the fact that his lovely wife (who he has been separated from for 6 months) has amnesia, and he conceals the fact that they were having problems so he can win back her love. But will the strange man who caused her head trauma come back to finish his job?The characters in this novel were two-dimensional and monotonous. I never experienced any feelings for the hero, and the narrative was extremely conventional; it lacked appeal. The love was nonexistent and the suspense was missing as well. I do not advocate spending time reading this book."
5,A Warm and Caring Book,"This is a wonderful book about visiting the sick. It provides useful guidance and puts readers in the settings. The stories are very human, and the book reminded me in that sense of Tuesdays With Morrie. I would recommend this book very much to all those who wish to help someone in need."
1,Broke the frist week.,"Look good, got here fast, but the lock inside broke in the frist week. Don't buy this get a better one."
4,Landmark Album.,"The Cosmic Jokers were never a real band; in 1973 Rolf-Ulrich Kaiser offered several prominent 'Cosmic' Musicians (style was later called ""Krautrock"" by the UK press) all the psycedelic drugs they could consume for a recording session. Afterwards he mixed the album together and released it under the title The Cosmic Jokers.The album is amazingly fluid despite its origins, and it wasn't until the second album was released that many of the musicians that made up The Cosmic Jokers realized they were a part of this so called 'Supergroup'.Originally only Rolf-Ulrich was credited with this album, but it stands as a landmark album in any sense for its conception and birth under such unique circumstances."
1,CD Needs Upgrade,"Someone needs to tell the publisher this CD is way out of date. It will not load on a Mac System X but requires SYstem 9 which is years old. System 9 will not even load on newer Intel Macs - so the CD is useless although it cost $82. Apparently the content is good from other reviews.Ronald Johnson, Walden University"
2,CD-ROM Read problems,"The content of the CD is awesome, but I had problems with two systems on loading the cd! Someone else reported that here, and in my class too. I Ended up getting an external usb cd drive, and while a little ""pausey"" here and there, at least I can watch the videos. Again, the content is great, and worth the hassle if you're going through it =( If you are, it's probably your hardware, ie: the cd drive you're using. I have no idea why. It's frustrating."
1,Double trouble,I ordered the CD-Rom for Integrative Counseling twice and both of them will not/did not work in my laptop. I tried it in another laptop they both still did not work. I have a Sony/Vaio and the other one was a HP. I would like to know what type of system will make this CD-ROM work?

4,Panasonic CQ-C1335UB,It's simple to use...has a great sound at at econical price...what more could you ask for. I love it!!!
1,CD is Marked wrong,"The CD has the correct label but a different album. I returned it and they sent another and it is the same, right label wrong music. I am not satisfied."
4,it's a textbook,"Okay, this is a textbook for a lower-level course in psychology of human development. It is pretty simplistic, I think. I wouldn't buy it unless it was assigned to me in a class or I was writing TV screen play and need some names and vocabulary to stick in a character's mouth."
3,Its ok,Shaggy's latest cd did provide some great listening but all in all can't compete with boombastic. It had fewer lyrical hits and could be a little drab. It also had some great songs that had the same great lyrics like in Boombastic. I would still recomend this highly but don't expect some of Shaggy's best
4,Maxtor 320GB external hard drive,"Received hard drive in record time, open box and followed four SIMPLE connection instructions. It fired up and worked perfect from the time I plugged it in. Perfect for storing all my picture and music without jamming up my C drive"
3,Lack of features - you could get better for the price,"Yeah, this is as basic as it gets. It could use a power button. The housing is as plain as it gets. It does work and I have had no issues, but for the cost you could get a larger capacity drive with better features if you shop around."
5,Excellent resource for quick info,I really enjoy the concise information in the Nurse's 3-Minute Clinical Reference. I am a Home Health Nurse as well as a Med-Surg. nurse and all the information is pertinent for a quick refresher course on cause and treatment.
5,No War Zone Comic and difficulty with stand.,"Out of my opened figures this by far is my favorite. It has excellent detail, articulation, paint, and the stand adds a nice touch. Out of all the pros, my favorite has to be the articulation although when I first opened it, it was a bit stiff. You can pretty much pose Frank Castle in any position you desire. The only negatives were that my package did not come with the War Zone Comic instead it came with a mini poster which is decent, and the stand required some assembly which was either defective or that's just how the are, the bottom part pretty much snaps on but was a workout getting it together. All in all, it's a great addition to anybody's collection, Punisher fans, Marvel fans, and also makes a nice action figure for the little ones. However, if the selling point was the War Zone comic beware. Mine was a Quebec version and was released in 2004."
4,Punisher Review,"My son collects various figures, and he thinks that this Punisher is the ""bomb"". Other Punisher toys do not compare to this one. Thank you for sending it so fast. It is very much appreciated."
5,Great embodiment of Frank Castle!,"I purchased the punisher from amazon.com about a month ago. His overall look is teriffic! It really looks like they pulled him right outta a gun fight with mob bosses or even Jigsaw.The only problems were the guns. He doesn't come with the shotgun as seen in the picture, just a m-16 and handgun, both of which don't quite into his hands, it takes a lot of finagling just to get it into his hands. But once you do get the guns in his hands and pose him with the backdrop he comes with, it's just mindblowing. He also comes with a punisher warzone comic, which was in pretty good condition.I gave this action figure 5 stars because the build and points of articulation are just amazing. I would suggest this to any collector of Marvel OR DC Comics, or those Punisher fans out there, like me!"
5,This is good stuff,I got this DVD fast. No complaints with Carlos Mencia. He still is just as funny - really enjoyed it.
4,Sister Princess Shines,"Whatever your thoughts about anime are, along with whatever you've heard about this anime series by ADV Films, this series deserves a special look by those of you looking for something different. At first glance, the series seems more aimed at children with the light and tender-hearted plots wandering through this series but after watching the first four episodes of this new series I found myself drawn to these characters.Why? It's not your usual puffy and teary-eyed anime. After watching the first episodes, whereas the main characters of the anime series are thoroughly introduced one by one the anime seems to take off on a beat on its own with the remaining episodes on this disk. If you're a fan of Ah! My Goddess, Love Hina or Tenchi Muyo then you're sure to love this wonderful series."
4,Sister Princess DVD 1 by Mew Kiki,"This anime is very cute, in fact it was so adorable I watched it every day straight for 13 days!!! It also can teach you lessons on how to treat your siblings. I noticed myself bieng nicer to my little, cute(but annoying) sisters. however this anime kinda gets on your nerves because Wateru's sisters are acting all lovey dovey with him. It's kinda wrong, in a sense cause their related, And I cant stand the oldest sister, Sakuya-she is such a flirt! It gets on my nerves! Anyway if you like a cute anime with girls personalities that you can relate to you'll like this anime very much. AND IT IS VERY CUTE!!!"
2,Fret Board Cleaner,"The product pictured on Amazon.com is a Bass Fuzz Pedal.The product description is fret board cleaner.When I contacted Amazons vendor about this issue they responded by asking if I wanted the product.I said ""no"", they said that their picture of the El Grande Bass Fuzz pedal would be taken down.I am not shopping through ""Woodwind Brasswind"" again"
2,"Good violinist, not the best pieces to showcase her talent","As other reviewers mentioned, Josefowicz is a good violinist, though I wouldn't put her in the top ranks as Shaham and Chang. Personally, I think she lacks the real passion required to be truly great.However, the music chosen to show her talent was disappointing. I expected an album entitled ""Bohemian Rhapsodies"" to be *much* more lively. Instead, we're left with ""Poeme"" by Chausson and other equally somnolent pieces. The ""Carmen Fantasy"" is a good introduction, and the ""Rondo Capriccioso"" of Saint-Saens is one of my favorite violin pieces, up there with Bruch's famous ""Violin Concerto in G minor"". However, these two pieces are not enough to make the entire CD a good buy."
2,Disappointing,"Leila Josefowicz is one of my favorite violinists, and I like her in recording as well as in live performance, so it pains me to give her only 2 stars for this album. Every piece in this album has an air of perfunctoriness, and the venerable Academy orchestra under the equally venerable Sir Neville never seem to click with their gifted soloist. The recorded sound is good, not spectacular, but this neither adds to nor detracts from the fact that the ""warhorses"" on this album do not need another just polite compilation, especially from a violinist like Ms Josefowicz. Listen to her ealier ""Solo"" album, and you will get an idea of what fire and passion Ms Josefowicz can add to her technical prowess. Sadly, this is simply absent from the current album. If you've never heard these pieces before, you wouldn't mind this album at all, but if you have heard the old masters (e.g. Heifetz, Ricci, etc) handle them, you will be left wanting much more."
5,Spiritual Madness,Absolutely powerful & real to lifes events. I'm so grateful for what I learned from this CD Audio I will continue to purchase her other CD's.
5,Caroline Myss is Extraordinary!,Spiritual Madness is another great share by the Wisest Medical Intuitive I Know - Caronline Myss! If you are not sure what is happening within yourself and your life is falling apart- this is the talk for you!!!
4,Great insights for those on a deep spiritual journey.,"Carolyn Myss is certainly one of the leading Spiritual Teachers of the day and Spiritual Madness gives insight for those going deeper on their Soul's Journey; and it gives an idea of what to expect when one does experience the Dark Night. At times she does come across a bit over the top on the need to suffer and suffer some more, plus a bit repetitive regarding all the different journals one should keep and also her constant use of the phrase ""If I was your Spiritual Adivsor"", but these are really nits. The bottom line is, if you are one who likes hearing it as it is, e.g. in your face real world Spiritual Guidance, this is well worth it. I teach a class called ""Practical Mysticism"" and her work is included, as it does force the students to be honest and real with their path."
4,Compelling and insightful,"Dr. Myss takes the spiritual traditions of east and west and brings them into contemporary spiritual practice. The madness of life becomes chaos that we need not fear, but embrace. The style of presentation is a bit sloppy and unstructured. The question and answer session is compelling"
4,"Helpful, but involved.","It's helpful for lifting the weight from the tummy and dispersing it so not all of your lower back gets the pain. However I think for women with back problems before pregnancy you might want to ask you physician what one they'd reccomend.The velcro straps are a bit of a process to get on, and if not done just so can be a little bit awkward or painful, but when adjusted just right they make for a very comfortable fit. It might be best to have assistance putting it on. That's how I found my best fit.Being a plus size women I found this to also be the best for fit. Not all of them make the larger sizes."
5,A truly moving story of a man with a Big Dream!,Read this book for an isider's look at Free Enterprise and the American Dream come true!His story is inspriring and encourages others to pursue their dreams with the same passion.....and compassion!
4,Great read that offers insight to success principles,"This is a great read. Van Andel offers, by way of his own experiences, many lessons and insights into principles of success. To read this also is to be reminded that we're a nation of wimps too often afraid to try new ventures. The writing is good, but not quite good enough to merit 5 stars."
5,Very honest and forthright.,"Very honest, forthright and touching. The most touching part of the book is where Mr. Van Andel describes his relationship with his wife and his commitment to her despite her struggle with Alzheimer's disease. I feel strongly that we need more people like Mr. Van Andel to show us by example that the vows of marriage are sacred."
4,Good Book,"Broken Wings is a touching, dark story about one young girl's forboding adventures into adulthood, filled with heartbreak and shocking outcomes...This dark, haunting tale is beauitfully written by a enthralling storyteller. Fans of Barathy Nadarajah's novels will love this series by VC Andrews too!"
3,The best of the miniseries/multi-girl books...,I have read every VCA novel and of course love the originals. I agree with the other poster that it was nice he didn't do a book for each girl... but they are young and don't have the fire. Keep trying Ghostwriter... you're getting there. We hope.
2,This Ghostwriter needs to stop,"The GW who took Andrews place has done it again! He's made a boring, same-old-plot book. I got through Robin but couldn't get through Teal because it was so boring. The only books the GW wrote which were good was the brand new Gemini series. I'm telling you, stick with Flowers in the Attic and the rest of that series, My Sweet Audrina, and the Gemini series. Don't waste your money! I went out and bought Broken Wings and the second one in the series: Midnight Flight. I did so believing in Andrews and thinking that this book would be so good I'd start reading the second in the series right after.I can't even get through Broken Wings, so I know Midnight Flight will be sitting on my shelf for awhile. This book is only good for burning. Use it in your fireplace on a cold winters night."
5,books,good place to find hard to get v c andrews books if you like to read the v c andrews books by a series as i do then go to next
4,Mini-series?,"I thought this book was okay. I didn't like that once you started to get into the characters the story ended. I like the series better, like Ruby and Dawn. I recently read a book by another author, Sherry A. Mauro. Her novel EVEN ANGELS FALL is similar to VCA's narrative style. I highly recommend this book to any VCA fans and horror/mystery booklovers!"
3,Where the wild girls roam..........,"Totally dissapointed. Why? Because like the latest books shot out of the V.C. book making machine characters did not seem really developed. Born to be bad..ok. They steal, lie ,drink and sleep around and act totally messed up which is a nice change of pace but I felt like it was the same paper dolls just dressed in biker chick wear this time. The characters don't seem very fleshed out to me and it's merely their anti social actions that seperate them from Melody or Laura in my mind. And the thing about them going to some 'special' jail. Gimme a break! Hopefully it's not going to be like the Orphan's or Falling Stars with some evil person running the place. Imo, it would be interesting to see them try to fend for themselves in a real jail. But these are V.C. girls, soft and sensitive inside, they would be pounded to play do putty in five seconds if they were in a real jail!"
3,One of the best recent V.C. books,"I think readers will enjoy this story of three struggling adolescent girls. The three girls are all sensitive, attractive, and intelligent, but they are all struggling with difficult home situations. It is not tremendously surprising, under these circumstances, that all three get themselves in trouble as a result. This book must be read with its sequel becuase that book shows how the lives of these very different girls intersect and how they all become close friends. I was surprised by how touched I ultimately was at the conclusion of their story. You will be too."
3,Hooked on the software but the book.........,"I began to read with great anticipation but was sorely disappointed. There were too many errors in the 2000 edition, which apparently had been revised in a hurry to catch up with the software upgrade. Many of the existing shortcuts were either inaccurate or, in the case of the new ones, omitted altogether. The author also geared much of his commentary towards Mac users and referred all unexplained problems back to the Final Manual. Very sketchy - and I still have not figured out how to set up the percussion so it sounds like the instruments I want. A complete waste of money."
2,"Its a start, but...","As a teacher of electronic music and a Finale user since 1992, I have been looking for a good, well-written and reasonably priced text on Finale for my students, other than the online documentation (which is actually not so bad in of itself). This book contains some OK beginning exercises for students, but is not what I would expect in a quality textbook on Finale, and for a semester long course in music notation, you run out of topics rather quickly. Particularly, there is no addressing the more powerful aspects of Finale, including the versitale MIDI tool, among other advanced features. I flipped through the Rudolph/Leonard book from Berklee Press briefly, and that looked much more promising, but it is considerably more expensive. Granted, the title of the book does say ""Primer"", but at the same time, the concept of ""Mastering"" falls way short with this book."
1,Sony D-NE18CK Atrac3/MP3 CD walkman,"This unit was an utter disappointment. I purchased it under the guise the a Sony would be reliable and of high functionality. Neither was true. The MP3 acronym only means that you can convert MP3's to their proprietary ATRAC format. While their format has merit in it's own right, their advertising and packaging is deceptive at best, if not an outright lie. So, I went ahead and converted several things to their format (which you cannot play on anything other sony ATRAC stuff) only to find out the unit would randomly emit a loud POP and completely reset itself. At first, I thought that this was the power supply (car power)but the same thing occurred when I used batteries. I lived with it for a while until finally, it became so prevalent (translate, frequent) that I gave up. In short, a piece of garbage."
2,Bad Choice,"Everything seems fine about this item until it's actually hooked up in my car. Everytime I turn the car off, the power to the player is off and it resets everything. The volume is digital so it resets to level 1, the cd starts on the first track, and the incredibly annoying beeping sound (when changing tracks, starting the cd, and continuously while paused) is reinstated. Basically this means that every time I start the car I have to hold the stop button for one second while turning the car on (to disable the beeping), set the volume, and find what track I was on. I'm sending it back. Don't buy it if your cigarette lighter turns off when the car is off."
2,mp3 player?,"Sony's mp3 decoder is horrible, it makes all mp3's sound [horrible]. Although I am not an audiophile the difference in quality of playback using Winamp on PC and Sony's mp3 player was very obvious.I you don't mind the terrible mp3 playback quality then go ahead and get this, otherwise look for something else. This one is designed to play CD and ATRAC formats, mp3 playback is a joke.Sony makes awesome hardware (like 50+ hrs of battery life) but spoils it by using some propreitary formats like ATRAC3. Why would anyone want to convert to Sony's propreitary format is beyond me.It seems like Sony has purposefully added a [bad] mp3 decoder on this player, perphaps under pressure from its music unit. That's what happens when a big company with numerous conflicting interests like Sony (member of RIAA) makes an mp3 player. Korean startups like iRiver seem to do a much better job."
2,Unreasonable 400 Mp3 Limit.,"Pros:80 hour mp3 play time.Resume to the exact point within MP3s.Fast forward.Supports 16 to 320 kbps.Cons:Unreasonable 400 Mp3 Limit.Fast forward is slow/awkward.Mysteriously doesn't play all discs (possibly burner soft/hardware related?).Cumbersome controls and wires.Hassle to plug/unplug from car.Remote ignores hold switch when unvelcroed.Remote too sensitive, when bumped wastes batteries."
2,Poor Design,"My old Sony Discman had a line-out jack situated next to the AC port for easy car-use. It was not affected by the disman's volume control. This one has only a headphone jack, so I have wires hanging off both sides. It also sits poorly in the pot under my dash. My biggest complaint is that the volume resets to zero every time it is turned on, or whenever the disc is changed out. This is an awful inconvenience while driving, as I have to change the disc, dig the discman out from under the dash, locate the volume control, and hold it for about ten seconds if I want it to be loud enough to hear through the cassette adaptor. Unfortunately, I bought mine on Ebay. If I had bought it at a store, I would return it and look for something good."
4,this thing has lasted...,"It has been over 2 years that I have had with this CD player, and it was worth it. When I got this, it was the latest technology and it was perfect, the ATRAC I bothered with only once and wasnt worth it. I switched to Music and MP3's which were still worth it. Its battery life is fantastic and lasts for months. Then MP3 players came out and got the Zen Touch 20 GB. Happy with that until it was stolen and this came back to my hands. I have been with this thing for so long, and it is extremely durable, even with paint missing and not looking so nice when I bought it. With new headphones and its construction, its one of the best CD players I have bought. Even with newer CD players comming out,this one has shown the true strength of sony and its capabillties, now get rid of the ATRAC and we will have a true IPOD killer!"
4,Very pleased with the player and car kit!,"I am completely hooked on listening to audiobooks, but my 12-year-old van only has a cassette player. Many of the books I want to listen to are only available from my library on CD, so I wanted a way to play CDs in my car. I really like this player! The ""cassette adapter"" works perfectly, although occasionally I do have to play with the sound settings to reduce background hum. I suspect this is related to specific CDs though, because others have no problem. I don't like the ""rotary commander"" remote control, I don't want to permanently mount it in the car but it doesn't work well unless it is mounted. Battery life is great, I'm still on my first set of batteries after MANY hours of use. I'm very very happy with my purchase!"
2,Purple Haze,"Are you totally down with becoming a stressed-out, discontent computer programmer, who after revealing his taste for sad guitar music and Nietzche, gets crimped up in a world painted in darkness, ancient and angry Aztec gods, and cybernetic ghost beetles at work? Optimistic and wool-eye blinded reviewers hype Indigo as an ""interactive movie,"" a ""never before seen game experience,"" et al. It's just a game combining the Matrix, Aztecs, end of world philosophy, and cult practices into one humdrum spectacle. My prophecy: This game will be forgotten. And McCain will win in '08, continuing his promise to carry America's war on Islam from Iraq, through Iran, into Afghanistan and beyond while ignoring the $4.35/gal. price on regular gas."
4,Indigo Prophecy,"when i purchased this game i thought it was going to be all violent and stuff. However, it is not as violent as i expected but it does contain some sexual references which i though was pretty funny. The story line is decent the game play is clever. I enjoyed playing this game and i recommend it to anyone who is into mystery/psychological thrillers. 8/10. I do advise that parents do not buy this game for people under 16 since it does contain sexual content, though not explicit. I Hope you enjoy the game and have fun."
4,Action or Story?,"If you like playing games for the story then you will like this game, but if your a looking for action you will be disappointed.For the most part you control the story, whatever you do will have a consequence good or bad. If you die you can let the game end there or load and try again.Through out the game you will play as four characters, a man who was possesed and murdered another man, and two cops who are on his trail. Everywhere in the game there will be minigames, that can be a bit redundant, but are fun just the same.So if you're into story like games you might want to look into this one."
2,what prophecy?,"Some sort of story going on here, but hard to follow. Hard to remember much from thisgame, except it was not much fun."
2,Worst of both Worlds,"Although it was somewhat enjoyable I'd have to say I was rather disappointed in this game. The most disappointing feature was how extremely little effect your actions had. Sure, you could fail a squence, but the game was advertised as having major changes in plotlines based on your actions. In the end it only really matters what you do in the final ""battle scene"" to see all the possible endings, besides a few minor variations. The only other effect is that some sequences of the game get a little harder if you do the earlier scenes badly. Regardless of this, most every ""puzzle"" was very easy.The action sequences got boring really quickly. They are like playing a retarded version of Simon Says, where you don't even have to memorize a sequence but just hit the buttons it tells you.Despite this, the game is fun to play through and has a good story."
5,Curtis Salgado is a Blues Legend,I have seen Curtis Salgado and his band and every time They put on a great show. Curtis is one Soulful blues artist. His music grows on you. I never ever get tired of listening to the CD's and I have them all. In my book Curtis is a Living Legend.
2,A disapointment,Curtis Salgadowas a very good performer. He still is. The used cd just had one track that was all messed up and wont play. I think the cd is a good example of what I remember almost 20 years ago up in Portland Oregon.
2,Small Capacity Cake Pan,"Very cute pan, but after reading the instructions I was very disappointed to find it does not hold a full cake mix recipe. Perhaps I overlooked it, but I don't think this important piece of information was included in the product description. I also ordered the Bakers Secret Christmas Tree pan, which also is small and holds about the same capacity, so I'm going to try dividing a cake mix recipe between the two pans and having two different smaller cakes. I haven't used the pans yet so I can't review their non-stick ability, but hopefully Bakers Secret won't disappoint me in this area as well."
5,Holiday fun,I loved this cake pan. We had a lot of fun decorating cakes with our Grandchildren before Christmas. It is small but the left over cake batter made great cupcakes to eat while you wait for the cake to cool.
1,Terrible quality...,"To make good/thick milk from this coconut, we have to use 3x as much compared to Bobs Red Mill. Avoid !"
2,Unpleasant aftertaste and much too dry,"I hate to go against the voting trend here but I have to be honest ~ I just don't like this product.I hate the dominating soapy aftertaste. It is strong and unpleasant and stays with me for hours.Also,Let's Do Organic Shredded, Unsweetened Coconut, 8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)as stated is very finely shredded ~ much too fine for my taste. It makes for an extremely dry coconut. Some may like that quality but I don't and I took to moistening it with coconut water or coconut milk.I purchased the pack of 12 from Amazon because it was such a value compared to buying it from the local health food store. That's a lot of coconut not to like. I ended up donating the rest of my case to a local food bank so at least it would not be wasted."
5,Delicious!,We put this in our smoothies each morning and have made a few other recipes! So handy to purchase in bulk!
2,Not Shredded--More of a GRATED Product,"Unfortunately, this product is not described accurately in its labeling. The consistency is fine, more grated. The problem is small coconut fibers tend to stick to the roof of one's mouth...creating a undesirable after effect. I'm not sure what I can make with these 12 bags of coconut now."
5,Better than Bob's Mills- lots of flavor,"We cook with coconut and nut flours often. This has a much better flavor than bob's mill. This brand has a fresh coconut taste whereas Bob's is much more bland and doens't taste that much like coconut. To make this brand more into flour, we just put it in the food processor for a few minutes and it is well worth the extra work for the flavor."
5,LOVE THE PRODUCT,"I would purchase this product again. Love it. Clean, packaged very nice and organic. What is there not to like? 5 stars on speed of shipment also, as well as the quality."
5,delicous coconut,this is by far the best and healthiest I've been able to find. also low carb as long as it's not consumed in serving sizes above whats recommended.
4,AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Guide for Patients and FamiliesIT'S A LITTLE TECHNICAL, BUT SURE TELLS YOU WHAT WANT YOU WANT TO KNOW. I WILL FIND OUT TOMORROW IF I HAVE IT,"
4,Blood sugar,A great resource to have when reading about blood sugar problems. Very informative. It is pretty basic and doesn't go extremely deep. I like it because it doesn't give a whole lot of technical mumbo jumbo. I can easily understand the dialog AND keep up.
4,Learned something New,"NoNo's:PotatoesRiceBeansFruitSweetsPastaBreadMilkSafe Zone:MeatSaladNutsWasa CrackersProtein bars98% of this I knew, but it has been through trial and error, the reason's behind the reactions were a great confirmation. The point of ill health this month that prompted me to purchase the book was even knowing 98% I was not sure what was happening and the Dr could not tell me, was the increase in beans in my diet to increase the fiber. Little did I know that it was a trigger.Overall good information in spite of the sermon."
5,Real blues,"Just can't go wrong with this guy, one of the best bluesmen ever. Here we hear him with a sparse and unobtrusive, yet supportive, backing band. This is real blues, and his gravelly voice is in top form. Excellent remastering and generous total timing. I'll have to get the complete set now, if it's all as good as this, as I expect it to be, it will be a good buy."
4,WHY ONLY 4 STARS YOU ASK?,"this book is excellent.... absolutely... so why only 4 stars... because it was published in '96! i'm a psychiatrist, just graduated in Oct '03 and during our C/L rotation (i took several months of elective rotations in C/L beyond the required) our attending was exceptional... he used to actually sit down with us during part of the day and do questions with us from this book...my passion is C/L psychiatry and i know this is a book i would so gladly buy and thoroughly use... the disappointing news i got when i contacted american psychiatric publishing is that sometime next year they plan to publish a book based on this title but it won't be a second edition... so i'm not sure what it will be, if the format will be the same or anything else about the bookto the drs. Wyszynski: PLEASE PUBLISH A SECOND EDITION! THERE ARE SO MANY WHO EAGERLY ANTICIPATE IT AND IT IS DEFINITELY TIME WITH ALL THE NEW ADVANCES IN PHARMACOTHERAPY...THANK YOU"
5,Good book,This book was interesting. I bought it for two of my friends after I read it. It makes you aware of your surroundings.
1,Hated it,The movie was not what I expected it to be. Kind of boring.I did not like this movie. Hated it! These reviews require too many words when a only a few are needed!
2,Have Not Received My Book,I ordered my book in early December and have still not received it as of January 4th 2011. I see others are having the same issue. i will gladly rate this seller higher if I can get my book. I start class on 1/5/2011. Any advice?
1,the kindle edition is defective,"I'm a big Travis McGee fan, and this book looks like it was in the tradition. I tried to start reading it today on my Android, but it is corrupted and jumps randomly around making it impossible to read. I've never encountered this with Kindle before, but had to return for a refund. I think I will purchase a used hard-copy, because I am still interested in reading the story."
3,Eton Style: An Early Version of 'The Great Gatsby'?,"Who would be prepared to pay twenty quid for a book that on its 168th page erroneously informs the reader that Eton college is ""on the river Thames in Buckinghamshire""? (Eton College is at Windsor, in the county of Royal Berkshire.) Obviously, the writer was no ""Oggsford man""Trimalchio: An Early Version of 'The Great Gatsby' (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of F. Scott Fitzgerald)"
4,I brew delicious coffee,"..In my dreams!I've used it in Vietnam and it's great! But be sure to get some *vietnamese coffee* and *condensed milk* to get the real flavour :)If I could just find a shop that would be able to send it all the way to Finland, I'd be very happy :)"
5,quit whining,"Ive owned this player for quite some time and love it. I use to listen to music and thats it. Sonicstage works fine. I even burn discs from it and if you have a car stereo that reads mp3s it will give you the name of the band ,track, or name of cds. It seems that everyone who doesnt like it wants something more than an mp3 player. the software has never caused me any problems. you can even update it for free. works just like windows media. piece of cake. remember...its for listening to music. Oh , and who needs more than 10 cds on one unit?"
3,eh,yea i had this thing for a year i payed 80 buks for it lasted a wile and played reall nice i hated thesoftware it came with suked so bad real difficult to use and plus it broke in half it so not sleek at all very fragile
2,"Nice design, terrible software","Yes, the design is nice and the battery live is good but the software is a disgrace. I also can not understand why Sony only supports USB 1.1 in this day and age. The disaster recovery - well the complete lack thereof - is a serious issue if you don't want to re-transfer all your CDs to a hard disk every time you experience hard disk problems or have to change machines. The SonicStage software is slow and not very user friendly. Why does the list of just recorded song keep refreshing every time a song is converted? Nice try Sony, but please package some usable software with your poducts."
1,Run for your lives,"What a mess. Sony missed the boat big time with this one. The software is a mess, buggy and doesn't work well with Windows. My puter crashed a minimum of 15 times in 2 days. Support? I had to hunt them down and then it took, no lie, 6 hours on the phone. Seems the CD was missing a .dll file and windows would not recognize their .inf files. In addition, the unit itself had to have the memory reformatted, a manufacturing issue. Now that it works, beware, unless you rip your own CDs or want to buy from the Sony Music Store, which, by the way, uses a different version of the software and will also crash your puter, you are pretty limited. I wish I had purchased another product, the use of this will be very limited and I cannot recommend it to anyone for any reason."
2,"Fancy, yet feeble..........","I've owned this for almost 1year. It looked Cool, yet after carrying and slighty bumped against a desk few times, it broke..Design is fancy and the format type(ATRAC3) is good to save a memory. However, the software occupies immense system resources. Overall, it was nothing but a funny toy for me.Although sound quality,design and portabilty are OK, durabilty makes this player as one of worst mp3 players i've owned..."
2,Now what?,"I ordered this player when it was first available from Sony. For the last year and a few months I have been happy with it. I do agreee with the software problems others have commented on, but the size and ease of use was a bonus for me and I was able to deal with the software issues. Now just as I am training for my first marathon... the battery will no longer charge. I have searched for information on replacement and I doubt I am/ will be the only one with this issue, there isn't even any information on the Sony website. Apple with the ipod/ipod mini have already addressed this issue with replacement batteries.I spent good money on this player more than a year ago, so it is no longer covered, but now I am stuck, with no options and no player. I would advise finding a different player unless you are willing to afford a new one in two years or unless Sony can fix the battery issues."
1,Very good for the 105 days it lasted.,"This is a light weight, compact unit that's perfect for those who listen to their own CDs. I haven't had issues transferring WAV files since I record off of my own CDs. It doesn't skip with movement and the sound is very good. However my unit stopped working 105 days after I received it. Being that the full warranty is only for 90 days, I am now stuck with paying shipping and labor charges to get it fixed (Sony only covers parts for 1 year). This is an expensive unit and I was happy with it while it worked but the price works out to 3$ per day. No MP3 unit is worth this price regardless of size, features and sound. You expect to pay a lot for a Mercedes but you also expect it to run for longer than 3 & 1/2 months."
2,"I like the concept, but","The idea of having a ladder readily available in a room while disguised as a chair appeals to me, but there's a bit of a problem with this ladder. It says not to use the top 2 steps, which basically puts you back to close to the height of the seat of the chair. So if you only use it as recommended, you could just stand on the the seat of any regular chair without the extra weight of the ""ladder"" part. I received this item very quickly, but it's not the best construction. The vertical pieces of the chair back separated from the 3 horizontal pieces, cracking the white paint, and making it a little wobbly. I chose to glue it back together rather than try to package it back up to return it."
1,Not funny.,"Let's stack this lame, formulaic retread against some cartoons that are actually watchable: The Simpsons was consistently brilliant for 8 years and can still hit some high marks. Futurama was original, superbly-drawn, and although it was inconsistent its best episodes were as good as anything. The Family Guy was (and is) sometime hilariously twisted. Compared to these shows, Sealab 2021 is nearly useless. It's visually crappy. Its characters aim for quirky, but come up short and fall squarely on annoying. The plotlines try to wring some humor out of bizarre situations, but it's a lost cause -- there's just no reason at all to care. I really don't understand why people like this show. I know it's on late at night, but I don't think I've ever been stoned and bored enough to get into lame, numbing garbage like this. Along with the static anime, this is a low point for Adult Swim."
2,"Show gets 5 stars, DVD gets 2 stars","First let me say that this is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. The sad thing is there just isn't enough episodes out there. There's only about a dozen, and they're each about 11minutes long. Let's do the math here...11X12=132minutes. Can someone PLEASE explain to me why this is a two disc set then? My King of Queens DVD set has 11episodes on JUST ONE DISC, and those episodes are more than twice as long as a Sealab 2021 episode. It seems to me like the company putting this DVD out is just interested in spreading out the material over 2 discs so that they can charge us consumers a higher price tag. This should really only be on one disc, and they should be charging HALF the price."
1,The Show = 5 Stars --- Warner Bros = 1 star!,"this is a total WASTE of 2 discs, and MONEY! the only reason it's 2-DVDs is so they can justify the OVERCHARGE to us fans! the content of BOTH DISCS = 6.64GB, and since you can fit 7.8GB nicely on 1 dual-layer DVD, it is a crime WB wastes the discs like this! i don't understand who is responsible for such waste, but we as the consumer should start complaining to WB about it! (they did this with Aqua Teen Hunger Force & Wonder Woman, ie... stretching the disc count to MORE than necessary) anyway, great show, and at least WB gets point for releasing it in the first place."
5,Another great Adult Swim show,"Sealab 2021, a show making fun of a short lived show back in the 70s, is like Cartoon Planet but with Sealab. A show that lasted for 4 years and passing the number of episodes of the original show. This and the second season were the best (and I never saw any episodes in the 3rd, 4th or 5th seasons) ones. Who couldn't forget the great, psychotic and racist Captain Murphy? or the innocent Dr. Quinn? or the idiot known as Stormy Waters? This had great episodes like Happy Cake Oven or When Captain Murphy was crushed and trapped under a soda machine and having a scorpion as a pet and giving him venom to live. also includes I, Robot, the episode where everybody except Dr. Quinn talk about being a robot, and Stimutacs. Recommended for Adult Swim fans and anybody else."
2,"Funny, but ultimately Empty and Soulless.","Let it never be said that Sealab 2021 was not funny.It is very funny, and like Space Ghost Coast to Coast and other similar ""Adult Swim"" shows, it has perfected the art of using crude sarcastic randomness overlaid upon earnest-looking 70s art to make you laugh. (I have come to think this is kind of a cheap trick.)But that's pretty much all it does. There's no interesting story, just the most bizarre sequence of unrelated events you can imagine. The jokes are not particularly smart, they just consistently hit that sweet-spot of randomness. The characters usually all die in every episode, preventing any plot progression or consistency. There's no original music to speak of save the catchy theme song. The animation reflects a clear minimum of effort.In conclusion ""Sealab"" is funny, but it is devoid of other entertainment-value content. So in my personal view it is 2 stars, it's entertaining, but not really worth watching."
1,Simply Horrible,"The author spends paragraphs, pages, and chapters on ideas that could be expressed clearly in one or two sentences. The author's prose reminds me of a speaker who is in love with the sound of his own voice and goes on and on and on and on....There are plenty of better books on writing out there; avoid this one."
4,sadly,"lo ascolto è pregiudicato in positivo dalla conoscenza della morte dell'autore, e dalle sue frequentazioni desert sessions.il disco è molto ispirato, malinconico, è quasi new age nel giungere nei pressi del non ritmo."
3,could be improved,Illustrations for building needed to be clearer with more detail and the text was too confusing.
5,Easy to make bird feeders,"Sorry it has taken so long to respond about this order,but I have just discovered how to use this web site. I am now trying to catch up on my reviews.This book was sent to my brother in Fla.and he has really enjoyed it`s contents. I hope to do more business w/your company in the future. Thank-you, ccoker br549"
4,Hasn't Skipped Once,"I took this CD Player on a backpacking trip in the Grand Canyon. I walked 40 miles while listening to it. It never skipped once. It was stuffed in my backpack while walking. With all of the shifting around, it NEVER changed its volume,stopped or skipped a track from a accidental button press."
5,I really love this little thing.,"I just got mine a couple of days ago. It is really beutifull gadget. It plays cd and mp3s very well, I did not try the Atrac3 files yet; The file navigation system works wonderfully; It is even smaller than I first thought; A very Well made product.One word of caution before you buy, you need a carrying case to go with it. It seems a little delicate, you could drop the sucker and loose $100.I really like it."
2,"Noisy product, short lifetime","My Sony Walkman was purchased for $99.99 in 7/03 and its disk spin motor has stopped, so CDs will not play. It was also noisy (clicks, ticks) while it played. I have owned other Sony products and have had no problems with them. This is the first time that I am quite disappointed with a Sony product for only 1.5 years of use. I called Sony Service Center and was told it could be replaced with a ""refurbished"" one at a cost of $78.97, recommending that it might be wiser to just buy a new one. I have no intention of doing either. I will inform my friends, including investors, of this experience, and cease purchasing Sony products and encourage them to do likewise."
3,good main event,"this video would have been better if the commentators could have been heard, i dont know if it was just my video or every video but you could hardely hear j.r. and the king. the rikishi/too cool vs. edge and christian/kurt angle was pretty entertaining. the latino heat/saturn/malenko was kind of boring.big show/shane was boring. the jericho/benoit match was one of the worst submission matches ever.the table match was okay.the main event was great however.the rock and hhh did a great job. and a great return for the undertaker.but this was basically just a 1 or 2 match ppv. i would only rent it."
5,Ok I beilive everybody here is wrong!,"Ok I ordered this PPV on T.V and I recorded it. Now if my mind serves me well: IT WAS A 2 HOUR IRON MAN MATCH! Why everybody keeps saying it is 1 I dunno, it was 2 hours"
1,I GUESS JUDEMENT DAY PPV'S IN THE WWF JUST STINK!,"BOTH JUDGEMENT DAY 98' AND 00' BOTHED STUNK!FIRST OFF, THE BOX COMPLETELY GAVE AWAY THE ENDING.THE IRON MAN MATCH WAZ A WASTE OF AN HOUR.THE JUST HAD EACH OTHER IN HOLDS THE WHOLE TIME.ALL THE OTHER MATCHES WERE PRETTY COOL.BOTH THIS AND THE 98' JUDGEMENT DAYZ STUNK!"
5,Your a Dumbass,all iron man matches are 1 hour long ya dumbass i suggest you buy the event and watch it
5,A Great Surprise,"WrestleMania 2000 had come and gone. It was a disappointment at best. It was supposed to be the greatest PPV of the year. I started thinking, if WrestleMania was any indication of what Judgment Day is going to be like, then I just wasted $50.00 on tickets. I couldnt been anymore wrong. Every match was great, with the exception of the Triple Threat between Saturn, Malenko, and Guerrero. The Iron Man Match was surprisingly good. It captured the awe of hardcore ""rasslin"" fans while still satisfying and enthralling the minds of ""sports-entertainment"" with some really great spots. The best part was the Undertaker's long-awaited and overdue return. It was HIS JUDGMENT DAY!"

2,waste of time,this ppv......all it is is wannabe wrestlers copying classics from the past.the benoit/jericho was wm 13 all over again with the stupid passout ending.rock/was terrible as every other rock match is .he cant put over because his ego is bigger than austin or hogan and he doesnt care about all the idiots that cheer him.please avoid.
2,Worst event of all!,I own WWF videos and this is the worst one I've ever seen! Don't waist your money! Buy another good one instead!
2,This should not be under the humor section,"If you're looking for funny books, this is not one of them. This book should be entitled personal, intimate, casual (or other synonyms) of famous people, and it should be categorized under history. If you're looking for a glance into the lives of important people in US history (esp. politicians, writers and artists), this book is for you. Just don't bring it to the beach expecting to laugh. It received high ratings, so I read it (I couldn't get through the whole thing and just skipped around to the people I found most interesting) but was not impressed. I love humor and I'm a history grad student so I appreciate certain histories (though I did not expect to see them here), but this book was just not for me. Perhaps I'm being overly harsh b/c I was really excited about reading something funny. If you go into this expecting something different, maybe you won't be as disappointed, just don't expect to laugh."
1,1 star for now (Slime feel and smells),"Can't be sure if the product is bad or another factor played a part. It was sealed by plastic and there was a seal under the lid. The experation date was good. Source Naturals seems pretty good.Only two things can be possible problems I suspect. 1. It took forever to get to me. I mean, it has traveled more than I will ever travel. Poor krill. First it gets plucked from its freezing water only to be squeezed to death and have its oil distributed out of Pheonix, Az (The hottest place on the planet). It then took a tour of FedEx in America. It went from Pheonix to Dallas, to Wisconsin, to Indianopolis to me over a two week period. 2. I don't get krill oil in genral. Maybe slime is part of the deal. Two months ago I started with fish oil from Wonder Labs. It wasn't slimy or it didn't stink nearly that much. If I don't get it, set me straight before I return it.Maybe my vote will change!"
4,Product was good...no fishy taste.,Overall good...the capsules smell bad but your swallowing it hence doesn't matter! I hope this product is natural as they claim..else not worth the money!
1,Online Label is Incorrect!,Astaxanthin is not 1.5 mg as label indicates. It's only 480 mcg. I should have read previous reviews before I ordered. C'mon Amazon... get Source Naturals to update the online info! I wonder how many other Source Naturals products are falsely advertised?
2,"What happened to my ""Auto Pay Subscription!?!?!""","I have been taking these for several months now and they seem to be working very well. If you keep them in the fridgerator, they don't smell as bad. Yes, they DO smell, NO that does not mean they are rancid. It's fish, what did you expect? At least I don't eh, ""burp"" this up like I have with other fish oils. So far, it has created no acid reflux issues so I am happy about that. I had these on a monthly subscription but last I checked, the subscription just vanished?!?! Without notice or warning! And this stinks because I was getting a MUCH better deal putting these on a monthly subscription. Now I have to remember to order them every month and to make matters worse, they are now MORE expensive per bottle than my monthly subscription was! Thanks a lot Amazon! I might just try to find these cheaper somewhere else now if I can. Don't offer a subscription if you don't intend to keep it Amazon!"
2,Fishy,"I was so excited to receive this product because of its superb ingredients and high amounts of phospholipids and asthaxanthin. When I opened up the bottle I was overwhelmed by a strong stench of fish. There is no getting around the smell, I am going to have to return the product despite it's superior ingredients."
5,"Hate how the pills smell, but they are effective","Tim Ferriss, author of The Four Hour Workweek, recommended these on his blog for helping with brain function and inflammation of joints, and gave evidence that they're better than fish oil.It's always hard to tell what's helping, but I do feel somewhat more clear-headed than usual after about three weeks of taking these pills daily, and my joints don't hurt as much as they usually do, even though the colder weather of the last few weeks should be making them hurt more.The pills do stink of fishiness, but once I swallow them, there haven't been any yucky fishy burps, so that puts them ahead of most fish oil pills."
5,Neptune Krill Oil,Neptune Krill Oil is 3X better for you than fish oil.Krill only comes from Antarcticaand has no mercury like some fish.
1,Smells horrible and tasts the same,"I use other Source Natural Products and have never had a problem with them.This one is the exception, it smells and tastes like fish gone bad.Some of the capsules seem to have been damaged, there was red oil all over the inside of both bottles.We ended up tossing out 240 softgels and buying a different brand."
3,Smells bad; otherwise probably fine,"I am just trying krill oil in lieu of fish oil because krill is lower on the food chain and might have accumulated fewer pollutants in its fat. I know of no way to evaluate the effectiveness, you just kind of take it on faith I suppose.Each time you open the bottle the smell is overwhelming, although I am able to take the pills without any problem. I do feel the need to wash my hands afterward to get the smell off.For all I know, all krill-oil products may have the same problem; but I think I will try a different brand when I am ready for more."
3,Seriously stinky!,I read this from other reviewers. Don't know how or if it effects the benefits of this product but the stink is pretty awful.
4,great,powerful stuff worth the investment ..much better then fish oil.. try it for yourself and you will like it ..yes
5,Great Product!,"Initially I bought this for my dad, to help with his diabetes and bought one for myself. He feels so good since he started taking them (sep 2011), the same goes for myself. Had some pain in my sacroiliac joints (AS) and since I started taking NKO the pain is gone and feel so energized. Very happy with this product, highly recommended."
4,Krill Oil,"I took krill oil, cut way back on saturated fat, added psyllium husk and Benecol chews. IN one month my cholesterol was in normal lmits. I""m not sure which factor had the most impact.. I suspect it was a combination."
1,Supplement facts have changed,"I first bought this Krill oil based on 1.5 mg of Astaxanthin contained in the softgel. I bought this about 7 months ago and was pleased. I re-ordered, what I thought was the same product only to find out that this very important ingredient was reduced to .480 mg. I wish that I had known about this change prior to my purchase. I contacted the distributor and all they could do was apologize."
5,Lowered my wife's bad cholesterol.,"My wife's doctor suggested she take these supplements in addition with her statin medication for her high cholesterol. After 3 months she tested again and her number dropped by 40 points! I am not on statin medication, but I am now also taking this once a day with my wife."
1,Nasty Smell,"I've been taking another krill oil product for several months...no smell no aftertaste.I ordered this thru Amazon trusting the selection since I could not find the one I wasusing. I chose NKO I purchased two bottles. Upon opening the bottle, the smell was putrid...I would not put onein my mouth...period! I have since found my former manufacturer of krill oil. I trust Amazon and even tho' Ihave read all the ""reviews"" before this one...maybe they would like to know there are better products out there."
1,NKO Krill Oil,"I hesitate to give this product only one star for a couple of reasons. First, I believe that Source Naturals makes high quality supplements. In fact, I use some of their other products (including Omega 3 Fish Oil) and will continue to use them. Second, I did not take the krill oil long enough to be able to determine its effectiveness.Having said that, the one star rating is because I could not tolerate the ""fishiness"" of the krill oil. The odor upon opening the bottle was almost overwhelming. I took two capsules with breakfast and the fish taste and odor stayed with me the rest of the day. One dose was all I could deal with.I should mention that I never eat shellfish. So, if you're accustomed to eating shellfish, your experience might not be so bad."
2,"Not a great deal, poor quality","For what it's worth, I always check oil quality by biting into a softgel from a new pack, and while krill oil always tastes quite bad, this brand was really bad.I now useKrill Oil 1000 mg - 60 softgels,(Good'n Natural)krill oil, it is a much better deal, about the same price but twice as much oil and tastes much better and has more Astaxanthin."
2,These songs were overplayed last year,"The Totally Country Collection is not that good because these songs were played to death on CMT and on country radio. These songs are so yesterday! A couple of things about this cd that get alot of country fans mad are 3 of the best men in country music are not even on this cd with a song there is no George Strait, Garth Brooks, or Alan Jackson on here what kind of country cd is that without at least one of those guys on it. I hope the next one is better from Totally Country. This was Totally Boring one song in particular that sticks out as being so old and overplayed is Sara Evans with Born to Fly how many times can anybody hear that song She is a great artist but I never cared for that song. Buy Forever Country its better the songs are better on that one. Very dissapointed in this collection this is bubble gum country on here."
1,Even Yoakam can't save it!,Anyone who's been around long enough knows that Dwight is one of the precious few left on radio that doesn't sound like everyone else. Any of the other 13 tracks from his excellent Tomorrow's Sounds Today recording would have been an improvement. Then 'Totally Boring Country' would have 2 stars!
3,The Lives and Times of Bonnie & Clyde,"It was ok........The best book re; the life of these two outlaws was ""Go Down Together""...... but i would recommend the lives and times as a book to read......"
2,Average Book & Facts,"I was disappointed with this book. The events described are an almost an hour by hour passage of time, during the short lives of these two antagonists. We really don't care what Clyde did at 2am on the morning of the 15th of the month if it really has nothing to do with the outcome of the event! It seems as if this author wrote these pages directly from a courtroom transcript or a witness' testimony. Furthermore, there are entirely too few pictures (we want to see more of Bonnie & Clyde - duh!!). Pass on this book and buy one of the others out there."
2,Shipping way too much,"I was going to buy these & then looked at the shipping charge. Ouch! If you want hangers online with a reasonable shipping charge, just google ""clothes hangers"" & you will get plenty.It's too bad, because these hangers are a really good buy, until you look at shipping."
1,I Brought Home Something Smelly From Target!,"The (1 star) is about the price not the quality of these hangers and also in response to the other reviewer. I went to Target and the reviewer was right the wooden hangers were there for that great price and I bought two boxes and came home and promptly hung all my hall closet coats and jackets on them. A couple of hours later I went to that closet to get a coat and there was a terrible chemicle odor. I discovered that each one had a smelly plastic wrap around the pant hanger part. So I removed the plastic with a knife, put the hangers outside to air out and no more smell. A bit of a hassle, but great a price for wooden hangers. Thanks-Catherine"
2,Not a good value at this price,"This is not a good value at the current price considering I just bought a 24 pak of equivalent wood Maple hangers at my local Target store for $14.49 + tax.That said, wood hangers are way better than cheapy plastic ones so I recommend them."
1,"Go to a Target store, don'tbuy them online","Target sells a 20 pack of wooden hangers for $9.99 in store. By the time you add shipping, etc to your order from amazon, you could have around 60 hangers (if you purchase in store) for the price of 30 hangers (amazon)."
2,Less expensive to purchase in store,Just to let everyone know... If it is convenience that you are looking for then but the 30-pack online and pay shipping. If you are looking for the best buy go to the store and buy the 20-pack (natural only) for less.
1,"Cool Looks, Junk Quality","CD player started failing off and on after a few months. I thought it was scratches on the CD discs. After a few more months it stopped reading any CD discs. I cannot find the receipt, so the warranty does not help. Cost for repair at Sony repair center is $109. A quick review of comments on the internet shows that this product has frequent CD failures. Don't take chances. If it is for your kids, don't suffer their disappointment. Buy a different model."
3,NO DISC Issue with me as well,"We got the item 2 months ago and we were very pleased with it. Three days ago I received the message ""NO DISC"" while trying to play CDs. Any CD will give me this message, there is no such thing like one CD is the source for the problem. Interesting as well is that I went back to fry's to exchange it and there is 0 left on the shelves. I presume that Sony did re-call or if they were all sold many, many are still to complain...i will search for service in my area to take it for repair...what a hassle."
1,DO NOT BUY!,I thought Sony was a reputable brand and that's why I bought this CD player/radio. My husband and I solely use it and after a couple of weeks the CD player does not work. It keeps saying that there is NO Disc. Sony is horrible they should re-call it. This is the third Sony electronic item that I have purchased that has broken down in a short period of time. DO NOT BUY!!!
1,Faulty CD Player,"This CD Player looks great. I bought it for my newborn's room. After one month, the CD player kept displaying ""no disc"". Not worth the money. Do not buy this Sony product."
1,Shame on Sony!,"This unit is a Sony, it looks great for kids, sounds OK, but don't let this fool you.As for most buyers, the CD failed after 2 weeks!Sony should recall this product.DO NOT BUY!"
1,major reliability problem for this product,"I have seen three of these and unfortunately owned one. All have what I assume to be a bad laser and all had the ""no disc"" message flashing. This is an initially pleasing product re: design & sound quality yet is an example of really bad quality control or maybe planned obsolescence that got carried away. I would buy precisely no Sony CD/ laser product unless it had a longer warranty."
3,No timer recordings,"This machine cannot make timer recordings from the radio because the Power On feature turns on the machine when a cassette is inserted and the record button is pushed. This is a major engineering flaw by Sony,a flaw my older JVC machine did not possess. My only reason for purchasing this unit was because my JVC can no longer record tapes."
2,"Babied the unit but still got ""no disc""","Interesting to see all the other ""no disc"" issues. I bought this new and it has never seen sunlight - it's in perfect cosmetic condition as it's always been perched in the corner of the kitchen and tuned only to the local NPR station. Sound is fine, small footprint is convenient, and I use the 60 minute radio-off timer most days. I probably had only played 10 CDs in the 10+ years I've owned it, but sure enough, I get ""no disc"" message anytime I try. I had thought of replacing the unit with another psyc but after seeing others have had the same issue, I'll look for another small footprint cd/cassette player. If the CD player worked I'd love this thing but reality is it's only good for radio (and I suppose cassette though I've never used it). Disappointed, cannot recommend. Surprise Sony put a dud on the market. Very un-Sonylike."
1,Overly complex controls,"I purchased this device a few years ago and have never been happy with it. Firstly, it is very difficult to setup anything on it...time...presetting channels. Anytime I want to perform some function, I always have to refer to the manual. I bought it thinking that Sony produces good products, however, in this case I was wrong. The controls for the tape cassette are counter intuitive and the tape stopped working after about 1/2 year. Stay away from this one."
2,I got mine working,"I don't recommend this device because the controls aren't welldesigned and of course there is the ""no disc"" problem. HoweverI got mine to to play CDs by plugging it into AC power instead ofrunning it on batteries. I think maybe the batteries were tooweak to power the laser."
1,A Lemon,"I bought this in June 2003. In August it stopped playing cds. Luckily my warranty covered fixing the repair. However, upon return I noticed scratches on the unit. When I called to complain, they said that the unit came into them as ""Fair"". Considering I got the unit 6 weeks earlier and it has been on my desk the whole time, I would not considered it ""fair"". Whatever! This month, November, the antennae literally just fell off. Mind you, I usually listen to cds so I don't touch the antennae. Sadly, the warranty does not cover the repair. The unit seems to me to be very fragile. Not a unit I can recommend."
3,Not as bad as all these jerks are saying.,This a good boombox. The only problems I have with it though is that you have to use a remote to skip the cd. I use this manly to record cds on to tapes and it does that with no problems. I have had this boombox for a year now and it has not broken down on me.
2,Bad design choices,"CD player is adequate; the cassette deck positioning & controls are counter-intuitive but functional; but the really annoying & unnecessary feature here is the never-ending unstoppable color-changing ""HELLO HELLO O HELL"" wrap-around flashing LCD display, which can only be shut down by unplugging the power. Some designer must have thought this display would look good in the showroom, but retailers know that if they ever turned these things on, no one would buy them - therefore purchasers don't see this useless & distracting waste of power until they get the thing home & regret buying it."
5,Good supplement to the module,"The filter/heater modules have a square flange at the bottom with screw holes for attachment to the floor of the aquarium cabinet (when placing in an upright position as I did). However, after hot-gluing one of these flanges to the body of the heater module, I used it to provide additional attachment to the back wall of the aquarium cabinet. It may not be entirely necessary, but it allowed a good, strong and clean installation."
5,Great Live Album Captures Singer-Songwriter Just Plain Rocking Out,"STAND IN THE FIRE, in its new remastered version, features singer-songwriter Warren Zevon just rocking out with the best of them. The album features two songs debuted on his 1981 tour- the title track and ""The Sin""- as well as four previously unreleased cuts. Although taking teasing like the humor in Zevon's songs makes you a stronger person, he was no novelty act, as this album, which has NEVER appeared on CD before, proves convincingly."
5,One great live set,"No beef with the above reviewer - this is one of the best live rock collections. The guitarist, David Landau, though is very much ""known"". He's performed widely over the years, including much studio and touring work with Joni Mitchell. Here, he just rocks. His solos are goose-bump producing."
4,"Hide The Kids, Warren is Back","I first had this album in the spring of 1981. It went on to prove that Mr. Zevon was no fluke. But after 26 years, and my copy wearing out, I had forgotten about it. I took a chance, one day, and looked it up on amazon and there it was------The Holy Grail!Rhino did a bang up job with the re-master, liner notes, and bonus tracks. Strap yourselves in. It will be a bumpy ride. But you'll enjoy the trip. All the songs are there too...."
5,Full out all on brilliance - live!,"This is how a live album should be done. It's fantastic, electrifying, and hard to only listen to it once when you put it on. This shows just what a musician Zevon was. The passion that comes over is astonishing and does his great songs justice. This CD is more like an experience - I strongly, strongly recommend it.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
1,Kindle edition is unreadable,"The kindle edition has many unreadable equations in it.I don't know the root cause (translation to kindle format, etc.)The bottom line is some of the equations are worthless.Don't buy this book in this format."
2,Very weak magnets,"Some Therion products are very good but not this one. The magnets in this wrist wrap are so weak, they may as well not be there. The only way I could get pain relief with this is by adding another magnet from a company that produces very powerful magnets."
2,Disappointing,"Feinstein is one of the top sportswriters around. This book sadly does not showcase those skills.The book is about the Final Four and the teams that made it in 2005. We get the usual background on players and coaches, but nothing that makes these stories particularly compelling. When I read a sports book, I want the author to take me there and show me the atmosphere or a unique view of the players' lives .Sadly, this book is like 99% of the sports books out there. Feinstein may once have been great, but he's slipping."
3,Last Dance,"I am typically a big John Feinstein fan and look forward to his books. However, this one is not as engaging as most of his books. There are parts of the book that focus too much on Officials and Tournament Committee Members. I would say that these areas really slowed the book down. When he covers the coaches and the historical aspects of the game the book reconnects. If you are a true college hoop fan you will like it but not love it as some of his other books."
4,A Great Read for College Basketball Fans,"If you are a college basketball fan and love following the division tournaments and the NCAA tournament, this is a great read. It gives you an inside perspective from coaches, referees and players. The author also gives you some historical references as well. This is an enoyable book and I highly recommend it."
1,Feinstein's Worst Effort,"I was sorely disappointed by this book. So much so, that I never even finished it. I have devoured most of Feinstein's other books (except for ""The Open"". But this one just left me snoozing. I was simply amazed at how many times the book repeated previous stories or quotes. And not just once; the same story was repeated 3-4 times in some instances. It's as if the editor or author never read the book as a whole, only in parts.Some of the stories were interesting, but overall this was not worthwhile."
2,Very disappointing,"Feinstein's books are getting lazier and lazier. As he has gotten older, his access to the a-players is better and better; his diligence worse. This one has a few good anecdotes, but those are outweighed by the lack of flow and repetition throughout."
2,Not Much New Here....,Wow- this was an easy one for Feinstein!! A rehash of a couple of his earlier books and a couple new stories he picked up while at the Final Four. This book is not bad- it just reads like a look at the Final Four only from the eyes of Duke and Carolina- and honestly much of the info has been covered by Feinstein before- He really mailed it in on this one- I mean you need to dig a little deeper in your source book than Coach K and Dean Smith for comments on everything in college hoops. I like Feinstein's book but have found them getting worse and worse through the years.
2,"Big hoops fan, but this book doesn't cut it","I love college basketball. John Feinstein's book provided some interesting and fun insights into the workings of the NCAA Tourney. Unfortunately, his editor did nothing but ""word-smith"" this book from notes. How else can you explain telling stories that were in the book 3 chapters ago magically reappearing! I liked the information, but the book was SOOO repetitive it killed me. Did I mention it was repetitive?"
2,"Gee, much of this seems like I've read it before....","...because I have! In his book on ACC basketball. In some cases, he didn't change a word....just repeated the same anecdotes. I am really glad that I didn't pay for this book because I would have been really angry about re-reading old material.If you like reading about ACC basketball, and you haven't read Feinstein's verrrry similar book, you will probably like it.If you like reading about Big East basketball when you're not reading about ACC basketball...you might like it.If you think that the basketball universe is bigger than the ACC, the Big East, and Feinstein's apparent obsession with Bob Knight, save your money for another book.It's too bad, really. Feinstein is a good writer. I guess the big buckets of cash he gets from each book he writes has finally caused him to lower his standards."
1,What does it profit our knowledge of a saint to psychoanalyze him?,"The back cover blurb says, ""In this fascinating new study of Francis of Assisi, author Susan W. McMichaels describes one man's struggle to become the hero of his own life.""What does it profit our knowledge of a saint to subject him to the theories of someone like Jung? In this book, the jargon of Jung, which was picked up by Joseph Campbell and embraced by public television viewers everywhere, is applied to a Catholic mystic: Suddenly the poverello, the little poor one of Assisi, was not simply seeking to follow Lady Poverty and Jesus Christ with a great passion. The poverello according to Jung according to McMichaels was a non-conformist on a quest to be individuated, to get out of the garden and to become his own hero. I think not."
3,Okay,"He's an okay player and this recording is also mediocre. But if your just an amateur classical music listener then it's a good performance. Otherwise if your listening to improve your piano, choose another cd."
5,Delta Heavy-Duty Glass Scraper,"After using ""Tooluxe Long Razor-Blade Scraper - Ultra-Comfort Handle"" and struggling to reach far ends of my windshield because of sticking bolt (screw) that is holding the head I decided to look for another glass scraper. That's how I found this one: Delta Heavy-Duty Glass Scraper. Although the handle is not as long as the old one, it is comfortable and alows me to reach areas previously unreachable for old scrapper. 5 replacement blades included. It is all-metal and sturdy so I hope it will last."
3,"Works ok, blade retracts too easily.",This works pretty well for removing stickers and grime from surfaces. My only problem with this is that the blade retracts into the handle too easily when pressure is applied while scraping.
4,Not for large jobs,"Got these to remove the Texas registration stickers from our windshield after we moved states. Didn't remove all the glue, but a little Goo gone helped with that.It was a little difficult to not press down on the ""catch"" when I was scraping hard, so the razor wouldn't retract. It comes with a pack of razors too. For small jobs this works, anything more and I'd get a paint scraper."
5,For the person who plays with ideas,"I've met people who seem to think that philosophy is about reading a philosopher's book in a week, listening to a two hour lecture that tells them what it's about, and moving on. This book isn't for those people. It's for people who as they're reading Aristotle, scribble in the margin, ""But what about....?"" If you like to think about big ideas that you haven't thought about before - to turn them around in your mind and feel the joy that flows out of these particular ideas - then this book is for you. The thinker who loves life."
1,What is this?,"It must be me...but this book is absolutely senseless. It does not say ANYTHING that I don't already know..and whatever little it does convey, it does so again and again and again....and again! Boring!"
1,Get a Life!,"The entire content of this book could be summarized in a single boring paragraph. Furthermore, it's mostly wrong. The author is attempting to teach something that cannot be learned from a book, and which he himself obviously has not yet learned.P.S. This book is an ""amateur philosophy"" book, and has nothing to do with mathematics."
2,meh,"Reading this book reminded me why I haven't read any philosophy in 10 years, and thus it'll be another 10 years before I try again (it'll probably be Foucalt's prison book next time). It's a mildly logical tract with some nice, pithy passages masquerading as a profound statement of truth. In the end, it doesn't tell us more about our milieu than we could have learned in 5 pages. The rest is fluff which might give the impression of profoundness and novelty.I'm perhaps in violent agreement with hangedman's statement of the character of the book, differing only the conclusion about whether said character is a positive or a negative. If you want poetry which imposes a world view about human nature, there are many better places to look."
5,A Classic,Destined to be a philosophical and theological classic. This is a short and dense work that must be chewed well.
1,Skip this one,"This is basic philosophy wrapped in a poor metaphor. To sum the book, there are things that we must cast off as trivial and there are things that transcend our immediate concerns. Pay attention to the larger concerns and forget the ""small stuff."" Read Epictetus or Marcus Aurelius instead if you wish to explore your own place in life."
4,Interesting!!!!,"Carse's general idea / concept of infinite & finite games is very interesting but I must say that as I read through the book I can't help but feel that there seems to be a departure. The book eventually evolve to something quite distrubing and unsure (to me at least). Perhaps it's something we are all not too fimilar with, but something just don't seem right. I think I'll go along with Hampden-Turner & Trompenaars' take on finite&infinite games as in their ""Mastering the infinite game"" book. They seem to catch the essense. Yes,indeed it's the essense of Carse's idea which makes ""finite & infinite games"" interesting."
4,Really brings back the memories,"Being a Southerner myself and born about the same time as the characters, I could really relate to this very interesting, sometimes quirky, alternately funny and grim story. This book is full of irony, mischief, and a whole lot of truth. I was involved in so many of the ""movements"" of the 60's. Alther's book often made me squirm. Were we really that self-righteous, hypocritical and plain dumb? I guess at times we were. Highly readable and very informative as well as good fun, that's Original Sins. I am eager to lend it to friends, especially a friend who was in her 40's when she first came to the USA."
4,A family novel with a social conscience,"or a political novel with a lot of heart and real-seeming characters that stick in your mind after you read about them.Tackles the big questions of American life from sometimes in the fifties through to the nineties without clubbing us over the head with any of it, and some of the questions clearly don't have easy answers. Less funny than a lot of Ms. Alther's earlier work, although misunderstandings between people are often good for a chuckle. I bought it as a deal of the day, but probably would have paid full price for it."
3,Original Sins,"The character development was good. That's the positive comment. The story, however, moved very slowly and did not keep my interest."
1,Worst book ever,"Very painful reading experience, characters unbelievable and shallow, story read like a very cheesy, comical soap opera. So much extraneous detail added to the chore of trying to finish book. Worst book ever read in my 50+ years of reading. Do not waste your time or money. This is my first negative book review because I have never felt so strongly about needing to warn other readers."
3,Yello Crib Skirt,"I purchased the YELLOW skirt to go with the coordinating YELLOW Bumper. The Yellow is soft and not a bright/pop yellow. My friends described it as a 'country yellow'. We have a standard crib and it fits the size of the mattress area, but is very long. Our mattress is set on the highest setting (since we will have a newborn) and it still drags a bit. I wash and iron everything purchased for the baby before installing or using and it made it out of the wash and dry intact and very soft, but full of wrinkles. I pulled out my starch spray and ironed it nice and crisp. It is thin material but, nothing I would consider low quality. We love it and are glad to have made the purchase."
2,Does not fit standard size crib.,"The item is very cute and exactly as it was in photos, except it does not fit a standard sized crib. The matching bumper fits and all the standard sized sheets I have purchased fit, but this item does not."
3,Not great,"I purchased this item in yellow at 55% off retail. The skirt fit our standard size crib just fine. The yellow is more pale and pastel than it appears in the image. The skirt as it is packaged is extremely wrinkly, and even after attentively ironing, the wrinkles are apparent. The fabric is thin and cheap looking, but if you are not looking close, it passes as okay.If you have time and any sewing skills and access to a sewing machine, make your own instead of purchasing this. A crib skirt is just five rectangles sewn together.55% off retail is a fair price for this skirt, but retail price is not justified by the low quality here. I am considering returning it since the color is a bit sad and since the quality is not very good."
3,"Cute, but was hoping for a brighter color green.","I was really hoping this crib skirt was more lime green like the picture. Instead it's more like sage green. After machine wash and iron it's still very wrinkled. However, I'm happy I made the purchase because it is the closest I found to match my crib bedding."
3,It's okay,"It's a pretty skirt. That being said...It's very long. Once the crib mattress is lowered the whole way, its on the floor."
4,Great crib skirt,"I got it in blue and is so cute. It fit a standard crib (I got a DaVInci KIlani). However, it was the perfect length if the crib was set to the highest setting, so unfortunately once my baby gets bigger and I want to lower the crib the skirt will sinch. Other than that, it's great for the price"
4,Good Choice,"I ordered this just to have Harmoniemesse but was happy to have the other pieces also. It's a nice variety of vocal arrangements. Recording is clear and chorus is good, sopranos sounding like boys choir. Ending of some phrases loses pitch sometimes but not enough to offend a sensetive ear."
3,"Uneven singing, but good buy","My choir will be singing the Kettledrum mass (Paukenmesse) next year and I wanted to hear it. This album has some very good works, but some are not as good. Given that its a 2 disc album, its a good buy."
2,overview of topics,"I was disappointed in this book, would not have purchased it if I had had it in hand. But I have been a full time trainer for over 50 years, written a number of articles on the subject, was editor of Equine Sports Medicine News so my opinion is from a professionals standpoint. Good book for amateur owners and those with a need to know more about their horse."
5,A Real Geisha Movie with great characters and a good story,"Let me start this review by saying that I had low expectations while going into this movie. But I am happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was very well done and the story, acting, and cinematography were all exquisite. Now I see why the film's cover-art and backside features a layout of all the awards for best director, best actress, best actor, and winner of Japan Academy awards for 1984. Numerous nominations and ""awards"" were won for this film. I feel that this motion picture, ""The Geisha"", is a true authentic portrayal of Geisha culture. It certainly has a more of a REAL-Geisha (accurate) feeling to it which brings the authenticity of Geisha culture to fruition. If you like the art of film in general, or if you enjoy enlightenment on Geisha culture and the talented form of Geisha traditions, along with good acting, some comedy, and passion, then I would highly recommend this piece of good cinema-making."
3,Oh my goodness!,"I got surprised because the rating, 18, and ""nudity and violence"" were only on the backside (appropriately enough) of the disc case, which was not shown and not mentioned at the site nor by any reviewers, and I read them all. I do think it ought to be mentioned SOMEwhere up front or by SOMEone amongst the reviewers. I think Amazon should require sellers to list ratings information; it isn't a great deal to ask of the sellers since the information is right there on the back, apparently."

En mi criterio, muy recomendable."
2,"At first, great--within a year it died. Twice.","Bought for a husband's dog walks, he loved it. At first. It was fabulous, got good reception of both radio and TV in Chicago. Then within a year, but after 90 days it died. But husband said, maybe it was his fault. So I bought another one. Same thing happened. Now twice. Same issue. Poor design. The antennae is the headphone wire and it just goes, even with careful, gentle use. So no, I do NOT recommend this gizmo. Sadly."
3,Its an ok product,my only complain is that is does not get great reception. Not bad for the price but it would be better if the reception was better.
3,decent product but room for improvement,"Small and light, but only poor to fair reception of distant stations. Also, lacks seek and/or scan features (called PLL tuning) to help find stations you don't know the frequency of. For example, when traveling, you have to tune in each available station manually."
3,Very nice...unless you are inside!,"I purchased this walkman for something to listen to at work when things got slow. My desk is 15 feet from an exterior window. On a good day I'll be able to pick up five FM stations, most will have constant ""snow."" I tried it outside, no problems! I was even getting stations that my car stereo couldnt get! I was really upset when I couldnt get any AM stations inside, especially when the Cubs were playing for a World Series position!"
5,Fantastic Sony Walkman,"I received my Sony Walkman today that is capable of fitting in Wristband case for easy use and convenience. For its small size, it has great sound & construction quality; range & channel pick up; digital tuning; built in clock; & 5 preset radio stations at a fantastic price."
4,Excellent radio portable best for the price!!,"This radio is far superior to the others. This is the original Sony Walkman -where most of the others are just bad copies. This rare gem is still around until they can improve and shrink the HD Radio. Which is too big for a pocket and needs to be recharge every day. THIS RADIO only requires 1 AAA battery for a week's worth of AM/FM/WB radio. There are 10 FM settings, 5 AM, 5 WB, and 5 for TV. The TV band has only a few FM stations -there is of course no more analog tv signal. The price was great from this company because they left the TV band in. Other go in and removed it and then charged 4x and 5x the price. The ONLY PROBLEM is that this radio will bleed in any stronger station over a weak one especially if you are in an area where others are all listening to ONE station. Otherwise for the price this the best on the Amazon market."
3,screen blured,The digital screen has a black streak through it making it s difficult to see the station or time. The sound Is not bad. The ear pods do not have any adjustment capabilities so they sit outside of the ear canal and that effects the audio quality.
2,Disappointment,"I've owned other Sony products and been pleased with them. This one is a disappointment. It plays beautifully, as long as you are not moving. If I use it while walking (remember, it is called ""Walkman"") the signal strength varies and noise intrudes. This is true even for strong local broadcasters. I would not buy this product again. Feh!"
1,TV Stations don't work with recent digital conversion,FYI: I have a similar product and as of Friday (6/12/09) I cannot get any of the TV stations. I am presuming it is because of the digital conversion.
2,If only it could receive FM stations,"I've been using this radio for about six months now. I don't actually use it very often because of the poor reception; I have an old cassette walkman that gets better FM reception and gets used more often. The good points on this radio are (1) simple to use, (2) small and light, (3) only uses one AAA battery, which lasts a long time, and (4) has weather band. However, the FM reception is very poor. Signal separation is very poor, even when listening to powerful local stations. Reception quality varies greatly with minor movement of the headphone cord. In general, acceptable reception is only possible in open-air sites, with careful positioning of the radio and headphone cord, and while remaining immobile. I plan to discard this unit and buy a Sangean."
4,So far so good,"I have had bad luck with running radios, but so far this one is holding up nicely. It's exactly what I was looking for--decent radio reception and a lock so I don't accidentally change the channel. The huge headphones are a minus, but I didn't expect good headphones in the first place. Another problem is TV channel reception. I only get PBS. I don't really care about that feature, so I give the radio 4 stars anyway."
5,Sony AM/FM Radio,This is a very basic yet solid AM/FM radio with 5 presets for each band. The radio uses very little battery so one AAA battery will last for a long time.
3,"Good, but t.v. channel won't work soon","This walkman works just fine and is a great deal for the price. Certainly as good or better reception then the more expensive models. May want to replace headphones for smaller. Only problem: If you purchase because of t.v. channel capability, this will no longer function once t.v. goes analog."
1,Sony SRF-M37V Walkman,Worst reception I have ever had in all the various Sony headsets I have purchased over the years.
5,Great AM Reception,"I've owned this little gem for over a year now, and I really like it. While most people may purchase this for overall adequate FM reception, a certain group may like the radio for AM. As small as it is, the radio is great for pulling in distant AM stations. Here at my location in central NY state, I could receive all the big stations up and down the east coast easily (KDKA, Pittsburgh, WBT Charlotte, WTIC, Hartford, Etc) Selectivity is pretty good also. I learned about this from CCrane, who specializes in Shortwave and AM/FM radios who also give it a good review."
4,Happy customer,"A little static in the weaker stations. Otherwise, the best walkman radio I've ever had."
1,Had to return it,I bought this based on the reiviews and the brand name (Sony) but I experienced really bad reception and static while using it during my walks in open areas such as parks.
4,Small and compact,"Good product, I wish it was a little bit stronger but who's to tell with am/fm radio being the way it is..."
4,Cannot imagine anything other than a high rating !,"I live on the mountain desert, about 20 miles from a university FM station. The ease of use and the performance of the little unit are simply outstanding. Granted that the earphones provided are far from the best (hence the 4 rating), but less than $20. can fix that (including any FM antenna shortfall)."
4,a good buy,"the item is excellenent for older folks because programming is simple and easy to understand. I bought it for my mother's walks and she loves it,with all bands avail. I especially liked it for the weather channel, God forbid turbelence comes to her area and they are w/o power."
4,Mostly good!,"This is a really solid product. My only concern is that the reception is a little weak. Anyway, this is a good re-introduction for me back into radio."
2,Poor reception( Sony SRF-M37V Walkman),"Local stations fade in and out on fm. On am, local stations mask all other adjacent stations .It is not a good radio for walking or exercising. The programmable feature is great but if you can't get the station it is not worth much. I would return itif I could."
4,"Pleased, so far!","I have used the product for about a month and am pleased, so far. About 9 months ago, I purchased a different model Sony Walkman from a retail store and it only worked for about 6 months and the AM radio quit working. I hope I have better luck with this one."
2,OK radio,The standard FM/AM reception is decent on this radio and it's size is convenient but I have yet to find a weather station on it. Maybe it's just me. I'm going to try another brand.
4,Better than satisfactory,This radio is quite nice. I use it while riding the bus to and from work and the sound is good; it is easy to use and the headphones are comfortable. The only downside is that the reception is not as good as I thought it would be.
4,Recommend to buy,"If you are looking for a walkman, I would recommmend this product. Considering the size and the price, it delivers the pretty good reception for am, fm, tv as well. One minor problem would be the battery does not last a long time, so bring the extra battery with you."
4,Reliable basic radio.,"Rugged, simple design, user-friendly, surprisingly good reception and long performance on a single battery"
2,Waste of Money,I bought this radio as a birthday present for my boyfriend. He was unable to get a clear reception anywhere outside in downtown Boston. It was a complete waste of money. Buyer Beware!!!
5,Great Radio!!!,"This is a wonderful little radio!! It's small and light weight. It has plenty of presets. And it pulls in stations as well as my Tivoli table radio does, maybe better. The included headphones aren't the greatest but that's kind of a given and to be expected. I've had my Sony SRF-M37V for three years. It's been dropped a few times and it's still going strong."
3,Why I bought it,"I bought this Sony to listen to AM stations (sports) in an enclosed building. I was so hoping this would be the one radio to surprise me and actually get these telecasts in. Again I was disappointed. It does fine with the FM stations, but so have the numerous radios I've bought previously. If anyone out there knows of one that will receive AM stations, please feel free to let me in on it! ([...]@aol.com)"
3,Beware!! No audio of TV stations with this product,"I bought this product specifically to receive audio of the 3 TV stations playing at the health club I recently joined. When it arrived I noticed the ""IMPORTANT FACT"" in small print on the front, which stated that this product will not transmit audio of TV stations once the changeover from analog to digital goes into effect. This information should have been provided by Amazon at the outset so purchasers needing this feature could avoid the hassle of having to return the product."
4,Nice portable radio,We are using two of these with a wireless FM transmittor in our Association's Athletic Club. Radios work like a charm and are very lightweight.
3,"amazon shipped wrong, but it works.",ordered the sony arm walkman and got the belt clip. it works well in most cases. the weatherband not so good. for the price it's a good buy.
2,Nice size poor quality,"Nice size portable radio. Reception poor with a lot of FM band overlapping. Tune for one station get 2-3 overlaping. Battery door broke within 2 weeks of use. Biggest complaint is the ear bud jack that within 1-2 months of use I get either right or left side of stereo sound and not both at once. And I have to keep moving the jack to get one side. I tried 2-4 different ear buds & head sets to no avail. You can't get to the plug in socket to fix without damaging the radio. This is the same problem I have had with other portable Sony radio products. Needest to say, I am not buying another Sony portable radio. Oh, at least the belt clip hasn't broken yet, even though it keeps slipping off my belt."
4,sony walkman,price was right-works good- but does not pick up all channels at the Y. M. C. A. Bought ear buds as the hd.fones that came with it were not very good. Ray
3,LOVED THIS PRODUCT BUT.....,"I really loved this product. It was perfect to use during my workouts at the gym. Great sound, very compact, just wonderful until....it fell off my waistband outside my house & the little piece that clips onto the waistband has just disappeard. This little piece slides in & out of the back of the unit (why is beyond me)instead of being molded TO the unit. Now I can't use it! I'd love to have another one, but am too leery to get one because of the possibility of it too sliding out & losing it."
4,Sony SRF-M37V FM/AM/Weather/TV Radio Walkman with 25 Memory Presets,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He really likes it. When he walks or does yard work, he can listen to the radio or certain TV station. He said the sound is very good. I would tell your viewers to buy it, it is a good price. It came to the home right away.I wasn't sure if you could really get TV stations and you can!"
3,Weak reception,"The radio is easy to use, but I work in a building and it is difficult to get clear reception."
4,Radio Walkman,"Reception better than most. Easy and convenient to operate. Just remember that TV audio won't work after Feb 09, so price should be discounted."
3,Too expensive for quality,I owned this radio for a year until it just stopped working for no reason. For $30 that is too expensive. Sony used to be known for it's high quality products. Not any more. You might as well buy three Colbys for the same price but either option is a gamble. Is plastic more expensive than metal? Isn't plastic made with oil? I don't get it.Does anyone make anything of quality anymore?
3,"Decent Radio, A Bit Overpriced","This is a decent radio, albeit (at least in my opinion) a bit overpriced. Size is great, and is the main reason why I am giving it 3 stars rather than 2 stars (headphones fit comfortably as well). FM reception is not as good as AM. I don't mind that as I enjoy using it to listen to talk radio. I would not recommend this radio if you want to primarily listen to FM. A perfect example would be the fact that I live in Rhode Island approximately 150 miles from New York City. When I want to listen to Yankee games, I can't get the Rhode Island FM station that broadcast the games, so I have to listen to WCBS-AM out of New York City."
2,Did Not get the product.,"I am very disappointed in my experience trying to get this product. I made a mistake on the front end by putting my billing address instead of my home address as this was a personal purchase. I live in Tennessee my billing address is in Houston. I tried to contact someone to change the address before it ever shipped but was told it could not be changed. Therefore the item went to the wrong address and was returned. I never got it,,,, I am NOT Happy at all with the stituation and will find somewere else to order this product."
2,Disappointing reception of weaker stations,"While this radio has several cool features, including VHF (channels 2-13) TV reception, it disappoints when the listener is trying to tune into weaker FM stations. It loses the signal or is overwhelmed by stronger stations when the wearer walks just a few yards. If you only listen to stations with strong signals, this is a good buy. Unfortunately I listen to the Bay Area NPR station for which this radio is relatively useless. It also does a poorer job indoors."
4,A commuter's delight,"This little radio fits in your T-shirt pocket without any bulk or weight. I use the small earphones so everything fits in my pants pocket without a problem. The sound quality is pretty good. The highs are desent and the bass is not too bad considering the size.Commuting on the bus between NYC and N.J., I find the sensitivity acceptable. Easy to use and ""program"". The weather and tv bands are a novelty but can come in handy. For convenience, this radio is very good."
4,Interesting Journey Through the Civil War South,"Arthur Fremantle was a British Army officer who (for ""a vacation"") went traveling through the Confederacy. On his journey, he met many top generals and was at Gettysburg during the vicious battle. One can get a unique perspective on how it was to live and travel in the South during the Civil War. Many interesting bits of information will greet the reader, among them a slave voluntarily leading Union prisoners through a Northern village. This is a must for all Civil War buffs."
5,A wonderful different perspective on the Civil War.,"Arthur Fremantle was a Lieutenant Colonel in the British Army. He took leave to tour the South during the three months up to the Battle of Gettysburg. This book is his diary, edited and published in England after he returned. He experienced many hardships initially but was essentially uncomplaining. He was very congenial with the southerners and was allowed to go many places and talk to many people, high and low, including Robert E. Lee and Jeff Davis. His views are insightful and as dispassionate as an Englishman of the time could be. He eventually rose to be chief of the British Army."
1,*Yawn*,"This shouldn't even be allowed to be sold. Me and Tyson went to [local store]. He said ""This blade looks cool, You should buy it"". I said, ""Naah. I just bought Draciel-S. You buy it instead."" So Tyson buys it. We go to my house, He tests it out against my Draciel. One hit from Draciel knocks the attack ring to bits. the rest of it goes sailing out of the BeyStadium. Tyson took it back and bought Trygle (He uses it quite well. So watch out.) DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT get this blade. It's a waste of plastic."
3,pathetic,i would reccomend not buying this blade if it doesn't brake on the first rip then it will be absoultly destroyed. My little cousin was very angry with this blade when my broke it's attack ring on the first try.
4,Don't use another weight ring!!!,"This blade seemed excellent at first, but i had a wolborg 2 and my friend had the master driger. When i battled it the first time i took it out easily. The second time, my friend used a Dranzer F weight ring because the driger's weight ring looked too big. This time when i battled it in the earthquake arena, mine hit it and made its bit chip and flew 20 feet away and the attack ring flew away. Even though i lost somehow, we looked for the attack ring. When we found it, it had a huge crack at the top. Finally, the third time, i attacked it and seperated its blade base, attack ring and weight disk. In conclusion, don't get this blade if you want to be a good blader. And customed blades are not always as good as the originals. Also, the Fighter types are better than the masters."
3,An ok blade but breaks easily,"Master Driger is an ok blade, but i wouldnt reconmend buying it because the attack ring is [weak]. In my first match with it i battled against my Wyborg and on the second hit the attack ring went flying out the stadium and landed on the flor in two pieces. The rest of the blade is good for customising though. Overall dont waste your money on master driger, buy Wyborg or Wolborg 2 they rock."
2,MASTER DRIGER Is SO... Horrible,"I bought this thing and it is so horrible! When I tried to test it out, When I battled Bump King, It crashed out and I lost the piece that holds the core onto the blade blase."
1,THIS IS THE WORST BEYBLADE EVER!,I hate this beyblade! The attack snaps in less than 1 day! Don't anyone get this beyblade. The only use for this is to beat this around with a Knight Dranzer.
5,gr8 attack ring,i had a jap master driger a ttack ring and it keeeps for long time im getting the blade from my mom for christmas im a blade lover buy this blade soon im a nine yerold who love beyblade see ya latter suckas ps i have a vortex stadium
2,The Worst Blade,"This is the worst blade I ever bought! Trust me, I battled one of my friends blade (ThunderClap Fighter, this is a jap blade) It attacked it once and then the attack ring boke in half."
4,The sorry Blade,This beyblade [is not good] mine broke in 2 days.I perfer not to get this this blade if i were u.
1,Poor Quality,I have read three stories from this book and it is already falling apart. You should buy this book used
3,Memoir of a student who doesn't want to sound pretentious,"After having to drag my I exhausted mind through a semester of english with this book as our choice reading material, I must say that I've become thouroghly disenchanted with this book's selected stories. This is not only because of the fact that most of these stories pull at your heartstrings but also are on topics that can be easily used as vessels to add depth or substance to story.I was also disappointed that almost half the selected readings were either from the US or England."
1,Not worth it,"Most teachers should know how to present this material without any help. Unfortunately, the help that is provided in this manual really is no help. One almost wonders if the author truly has any educational background or experience."
2,Electronic Service plan with Amazon,"The time starts ticking when the item is purchased, not when it ships! The GPS that I bought will not ship for another couple of months, and I agreed to purchase it a month ago. So with the one year manufacturer's warranty (or whatever), and the three months (or more?)one is actually being delivered less than expected."
2,It does not cover your projector bulb!?,"I purchased this plan with an Optoma projector. I expected the life of the bulb (based on the number of hours used) to last me at least three years (I reviewed the specs). It was recommended by Amazon's site to purchase this company's plan with the projector.However, less than 22 months of use the bulb is deteriorating. I contacted the company about bulb replacement and they said that bulb replacement is not covered under the warranty. Please be aware of what is and what is not covered by their warranties. I expected additional service plans to cover against such potential problems."
4,Future Insurance for GPS,"Hi, I bought this insurance for a GPS unit. Haven't had to use it as of yet. I just hope if I do need to use it, it's not going to be a sticky did you cross all your T's and dot all your I's kind of thing, before or if they will do anything. Been there done that. Time will tell. Sometime it's a waste of money because you bought a great item, other times it was made on a Monday or Friday, and you'll be glad you spent the extra money."
5,grocery shopping onliner,"The product was excellent and one I have used in the past. I have used this on-line grocery site through aol for two other orders since and have been well pleased with everything I have received from this on-line market.Though the shipping charges through UPS are high, that is something out of this site's control. Thank you for sponsoring the shopping opportunity through your servers"
5,Inspiration for the soul,"Handy's reasonable tome unveils an argument for becoming questioning, seeking, unreasonable individuals. Written several years ago, Handy's ability to forecast the direction in which businesses are moving (adopting 'cores' and contracting out much of the work) is fascinating. I wonder what I would have thought of this book 8 years ago when it was first published. 'Is he for real?' Charles Handy is very real and so is the future about which he writes"
4,Will stretch your thinking,"Very though provoking read. Even though written in '89 it has some very topical and relevant ideas. This is by no means a how to book, although there are suggestions and concepts to consider. Rather Handy gives arguments and suggestions on why adaptation to worn out approaches to organizations need to be considered. His writing style is informative without being overbearing, pretty quick read. If someone wants to understand more on why organizations need to adapt their designs and what some of the implications are then this is a good read, although some ideas are unique."
4,Re-fried Mintzberg (but very tasty),"Age of Unreason appeared more than a decade after Mintzberg's ""the Structuring of Organizations."" In it Mintzberg described the strategic and technical core and the contingent outer-layers of an organization. This laid the theoretical basis for the dissolution of the fully integrated organization. Even so, while Handy's book is not wholly original it is a significant contribution to the literature, as he explored the implication of Mintzberg's concepts to a greater degree than did Mintzberg and then described the implication for the individual. He then prescribed constant self-investment. Nearly two decades later, his advice is still true. I'd say it's full of prescient insights such as that, even if it is heavily derivative of Mintzberg."
4,Sister Shinobi,"Nightshade is basically a sequel or more like a spinoff from the previous shinobi game 2 years ago. although the graphics,character designs and music are simular the gameplay itself has improved and far less frustrating than it's predescessor. your character can perform mid-air sword attacks and even combos.the stages vary from fighting atop of stelth bombers,rooftops,a convoy of exploding trucks and more.the objective within the storyline takes you on a quest to recover all the pieces of the akuji sword (the cursed sword that drains the life from it's welder, as previously noted in SHINOBI)and bring a former master now traitor to justice.this game is a must for SHINOBI fans, but also serves as an ""appetizer"" till NINJA GAIDEN (a shinobi cookie cutter game albiet a very good one)appears on the X-BOX."
2,I prefer SHINOBI!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I admit that this game improved many thing that Shinobi should have, like: more fun (I liked the train stage), better graphics, better positions after killing and more difficulty.Shinobi is better (for me) because the character look's SOOOO COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!! The cape like SPAWN, dressing dark green, gloves made of shurikens, four cool dark eyes and the movie sequences were SOOO great!!!!!!!!The girl in NIGHSHADE look's lame compared to Shinobi, so I guess this game is no THAT cool after all, and besides there are daylight missions witch it's not cool for ninjas.If you like improve fun sequels then this game is for you but if you are looking for fun and cool characters then this game suck's!!!!!P.S: Stay with Shinobi if you want cool fun and cool character!Adios!!!"
2,Nightshade continues the ninja saga,"The reason for the two star rating is because although it was a great game with a good storyline most people would wind up pulling there hair out playing this. The bosses are very hard, The camra angles are not good at all, and there is to much jumping involved. 2 parts of a level involved jumping while avoiding waterfalls that could knock you down and enemies shooting at you from all sides with a small wall to cling to unless you are a master at this this will drive you insane."
3,"Fun, but extremely difficult","I just bought Nightshade for the PS2, and it's a good game, but extremely difficult. The levels start off very easy, but they turn hard VERY quickly. More off the time I find myself with game overs not because the enemies have killed me, but because Hibana will target something obscure; causing me to fall down a bottomless pit or into the water e.t.c. I won the game in beginner mode, and that was a challenge within itself. I can't even pass stage 4 in easy due to the fact the controls are VERY difficult and fickle (you can only stealth dash one time when you're in mid-air... I hate this because it takes more than one stealth dash to reach the enemies sometimes. They should have an option so you can use beginner controls in any mode not just beginner). To sum it up, if you're looking for a good challenge and are willing to become a little annoyed, buy this game. If not, stay away from it.K@zami Am!"
3,Frustrating to the limit!,"I liked the gameplay videos I saw on the web. It really looked like the game system would give me a ninja like experience when playing. After I tried it, I confirmed my predictions except by a inevitable fact that this title's difficulty was extremely hard. I bought it a few years ago and still haven't been able to complete it. What I hate most is that there isn't save states in the middle of levels so if you can't beat the boss, you are forced to start all over again next time you turn on the ps2. That is discouraging enough to keep it in its box for several months hoping the desire to complete it comes back again.Unfortunately, I am stubborn enough to keep trying... but not until one or two months have passed again."
3,Confusing but good at the same time,"This book took me so long to get through! A lot of the prose was very dense and I found myself having to go extra slow for fear of missing a hidden meaning. I went up and down with this book.It would really pull me in for a few chapters, then I'd trudge through a few more, wishing I was nearer the end.The engrossing parts of it were super and it is an interesting story.My feelings about this book are mixed.I skimmed the last few chapters .I would tell anybody that reads this book to make sure they have plenty of time and patience.I think it really could be rewarding for a person with both of the above."
5,Thank you: Minor Elegance,Thank you for making this available. Thank you for fast shipment and an overall smooth transaction! The CD has found a good home. ;o)
3,too preachy,I would have preferred something that verbally couched you through breathing exercises during various relaxing musical interludes - there's like an hour of some guy lecturing you before you get to actually relax. Next time I'll just read a TiChi pamphlet while listening to a Windham Hill CD.
5,Great for relaxing.,"I enjoy this book, it helps me relax and focus on my breathing. I recomend this author. I do have several of his books on CD and find them helpful."
2,No removal tool,No removal tool for the locking screws. Works good but you will need a special key to remove the screws (which I dont have).
2,Glad it was cheap,"Def not a good book for those who don't like to travel to just the big cities. It has a basic synopsis of 2-3 major cities in each of the countries. It mostly focuses on hotels and restaurants instead of sights. A better book to buy is Lonely Plants On a Shoestring, it at least gets cities that aren't complete tourist attractions and gives you some sights to see. It's sad that I now have to buy a book specifically for each country that I'm going to visit and so far that's gonna be over 7 books to tote around. Def save your money and do internet research or get lonely planets book"
2,What?,"In Europe now for almost 2 years I have done a lot of page flipping with this book ... back and forth...searching for useful information. There is some but certainly not worthy of over one thousand pages. Now I am headed for France and this will be my first time in Paris and was planning a trip to Normandy so I opened my book and there is absolutely no mention of anything. They have a map of France with some of the cities in this region and have chose to exclude everything else. I have heard so much about the museums and memorials, as well as the towns, scenery and atmosphere of this region. It is a shame this book does not describe it. 2 stars for effort...but my niece came to visit during her Europe trip and she had Rick Steves Travel Book...she loved it."
1,This is NOT a reference book!,"This book was extremely disappointing. Not only is there no Interactive Table of Contents, there is no table of contents or index at all. This is absurd for a book of over 1000 pages. I expect the TOC problem when I get free or 99 cent e-books, but not at $14. I am soon going to be making a long trip within Europe. I need a reference book where I can quickly look up a city or area and get useful information. I am not looking for a hotel, which seems to be what this book is about. Anyway I returned it within 1 hour of purchase. Sadly, while I had high hopes (considering the publisher), for me the book was useless."
3,It could be better,"This guide is full of information but it lacks of suggested city itineraries, instead it has a comprehensive list of companies with their phone numbers (like american express) that you can easily find at any corner when travelling. I expected more info on clubs, restaurants, bars, shopping centres, etc."
5,A Must-Read For Animal Rights Activists,"The compiler of this book is probably great, but the quotes she puts in from people who don't believe in animal rights is mostly bull, and I am sure Janelle is aware of this. I think the sole reason this book exists is because before we go protesting against something, we must know our opponents' point of view, no matter how lame it may seem, or else we will not appear educated. This unique book is a must-have for anyone who tells people about the torture of animals in factory farms, laboratorys, etc. etc. etc."
4,Good reference,"I have used this book in support of flow induced vibration analysis of heat exchangers and steam generators. This provides ready reference to closed form solutions for mode shapes and frequency calculations for basic tube configurations (straight, U-bend, helix) that can be used as a check against more complicated finite element model solutions. If you are working on flow induced vibration get this book along with Au-yang and will instantly have a credible set of references."
4,Hicca Bicca Boo? Hoosha!,"This is a cool DVD that your kids will like, even though the whole time-travel/space-time-continum stuff will probably go over their heads. Ron's fear of monkeys is worth the price alone. We also discover that everyone in the future is ""ripped"" (even Wade!).""No touchee my monkey!"" - Future Shego"
5,A really good movie,"My name is Haven I am Ryan's niece. This Kim Possible movie is really good to come on t.v. If you ever saw when Kim was a little girl then you would see that but the only difference is that you will see Drakken ,Monkey fist, and that golf guy.But in this movie it is a sad part when Ron moves to a different contenet. And every time the bad guys come as soon as Ron gets there they are already gone. But finally on the last time they get somewhere then Ron was finally on time. Now I bet you are wondering how Ron gets to talk to Ron and how he knows about everything. Wane hooked Ron up with the blue thing that Kim has."
5,so NOT the DRAMA! 5 kazillion thumbs up for this movie!!!!!,"Kim Possible is SO TOTALLY COOL! I just LOVE her new movie. I can't wait until 'SO THE DRAMA' is MINE. Can't you believe it? I wish Kim could just KICK Bonnie (a.k.a. BON-BON) off the squad. That'll teach HER not to mess with THE KIMSTER. And Drakken.... JUST GIVE UP, cause there's, like, NO WAY u r gonna stop the UNSTOPPABLE KIM POSSIBLE! BOOYAH! Yeah, Ron, lay off of the girls for a while....u need to relax. No offense, but u r NOT much of a babe magnet....even 4 me and I'm a girl. I like u, but u need some time off, DUDE. Wade...PLEASE TAKE A BREAK! U NEED IT, DUDE. On the other hand, u wouldn't be able to help KIM, and that would be a MAJOR CATASTROPHE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,So-so Book,"When I received this book I began to read it avidly until, little by little, I realized that it wasn't the book I'd hoped it would be. The author is chatty and sincere but, basically what you have here is Tibetan Buddhism Lite! I, for one, was very disappointed."
5,Want to know what Beauty sounds like?,"This is a masterpiece. While it may be relatively easy to throw around such superlatives with much of Salif Keita's work, let me confess: I've not even heard the entire album yet! I am writing this simply based upon having listened to the opening track ""Yamore"" a few minutes back. A few times actually; like three times in a row. I don't care what the rest of the album sounds like. The first 7 minutes will make you feel what beauty sounds like."
5,This Clock Rules,"I have had this alarm clock for 7 years, it just recently stopped working for me because I wore it out. The CD Alarm clock feature lets you choose which track you want to wake up to. I highly recomened it to anyone who hates to get out of bed in the morning because this alarm clock lets you wake up to your favoriate jam. It also has a pretty awesome FM tuner though it is a little hard sometimes to pick up stations."
1,Keep looking....,"My daughter received this as a gift. I hate this product beacuse every time the power goes out, or the item gets unplugged, the clock and alarms reset to 12:00. How I wish it had a battery backup! Most of my other home electronics have this feature. Sadly, not this one. Keep shopping."
4,SLEEK,"I purchased this Sony Psyc for our baby's room to replace a boom box we used to play music at night. Our oldest took the boom box to college! The sound is good and it serves the purpose I purchased it for--playing a cd and having the ability to ""repeat"". It doesn't take up much room (although there are smaller ones out there), and it has a sleek look. I'm not sure what the ""Psyc"" clip is for; so I'm sure I'll never use it. I do wish it had presets, but since it's in the baby's room, it doesn't matter that much."
3,OK - but not great,"I bought this yesterday. I really bought this to be a mini boom box for my kitchen. Here's what I discovered that I didn't like about the product:1 - The sound is not so good. I bought an RCA (w/vertical CD placement) at the same time. The RCAs sound was much better.2 - The Sony requires manual tuning of the radio. No presets.3 - Manual volume control.4 - The buttons for CD use are confusing. The play and stop buttons blend in with the other buttons.I did like:1 - The FM antenna. Better reception than the RCA. I live in a valley, so reception is difficult.2- The rest of the features seem on par with others in this price range."
5,A very nice find among Renaissance liturgical music,"The other reviewers give a far better appreciation of the technical merits of the Tallis Scholars' interpretation and other fine points of this recording. Speaking as the peripetatic (sic) amateur who pokes his nose into some of the dustier corners of world music, I find this an excellent find off the beaten trail. It is richer than the medieval plainchant and purer, and more inspiring than the more elaborate baroque and classical works. A very decent find for the roaming listener."
2,Free with Price of Admission,"This self-glorifying piece of garbage seems like the kind of book that comes free when you pay to see the author speak about modern business. Problem is, with most of these types of books as a matter of fact, the people writing them have been out of business for several years and it shows.I received this book for Christmas because my brother thought it was actually about ESPN. The other reviewers nailed it when they said ESPN is only used to sell the book. The early days of ESPN, the operation, were dry and lifeless in this presentation."
2,Completely Misleading Title,"It's not that this is a terrible read, because Evey does have some interesting stories to tell. It's just that the title is completely false, and people expecting meaningful insight into ESPN won't get it here. This is not the history of ESPN, or even an in-depth look at its creation. It's the autobiography of Evey, pure and simple, and his ESPN dealings get the focus of about half the book. But even that section is just about HIS dealings, not the bigger picture. I'm going to give him two stars because some of this stuff is kind of interesting.But I really don't like being conned, and (even though I just plunked down $1 for this at a used book sale) I was conned. I admit I wouldn't have looked twice at a book called ""The Stuart Evey Story,"" but the big ""ESPN"" on the cover grabbed me.Evey acknowledges that part of his success as an oil executive and resort developer was conning people a bit. Well, he's used the same method to sell his book. Don't be conned."
1,"Puh-leeze, Mr. Evey....","You'd be better off reading Michael Freeman's ""ESPN: The Uncensored History."" Freeman's book is extremely thoroughly researched and Evey comes off as quite a jerk. He thought because he brought the money to make it a go, it was HIS network (wrong) and he could make decisions without the input of Chet Simmons (also wrong). He also thought--again, because he brought the money--that he could take ALL the credit for ESPN (extremely wrong). He did occasionally have good, useful ideas but this is not a guy you would want to work with. Bill Rasmussen still can't stand to hear his name."
2,OK to read for perspective,"This is as mentioned an autobiography. For those who have read Sports Junkies Rejoice by Bill Rasmussen this gives another perspective on the founding of ESPN. Rasmussen's book is a little more technical and not as ""action packed"" but seems more informative. This book is filled with Evey's Ego and his justifications for kind of screwing over Rasmussen. Still it is good to see the other side. The thing is while Rasmussen had the idea, and Evey got the Getty money, the real success of the network came down to those who hosted and produced sportscenter, broadcast the events and marketed the network. ESPN did not really become a full fledged success until the 1990s. Really the network was still showing reruns of the 1960 TV series Home Run Derby in 1989. So while the founding is an interesting story it isn't until a majority of TV's got cable and ESPN got good sports contracts (the NFL and MLB) that ESPN became the giant that it is now."
2,"Petit Messe:lovely piece,uneven performance","The gorgeous Kyrie from the Peit Messe Solonnelle has recently been used to good effect in the film 'Bad Education' prompting me to get to know the piece better and purchase this recording.The whole work is a delight,much lighter in tone and broader in length than the title would suggest.However,i suspect this is not the recording to have(i'm going to try Muti/EMI)as the soloists(a glamorous team)are unfocused and intonation a particular problem.There's a surprisngly tentative feeling about the whole performance.The piano part(a few splashy moments here) is normally taken on 2 pianos but here they make do with 1.....seems a shame to me.Stabat Mater receives an authorative account,another very approachable work which i shall enjoy getting to know better."
4,lovely,"Superb solo singing, especially fro Pavarotti and Freni. The chorus and pianists are a bit rough around the edges but a glorious work given a powerful reading."
2,Disappointing,"First of all, the composition itself (Petite Messe Solennelle) may not be for everyone. There are some fine moments, but I find many of the choral movements to be sprawling and unfocused. The martial-sounding tenor aria is a little goofy and operatic for it's sacred text, but if you really like Rossini, you might get some guilty pleasure out of it. The soloists are uneven (I find the bass and mezzo to be especially disappointing). In general, there are some terrifying intonation moments, especially during the treacherous (a cappella) Sanctus. Wish I could recommend a better recording, but this is my first acquaintence with the piece. All things considered, I plan on dumping my copy. I haven't even listened to the Stabat Mater, which of course is much more widely recorded work."
1,"Faulty and cheap, and really really hard to set time","I bought two of these in black and thought they would be easy to use in my car. The instruction sheet was tiny (2 inches x 1 inch?), and the text was minuscule. Then, once you actually read the instructions, it was ridiculous to set things, and even more ridiculous to remember how to do it from one time to the next. The time became too close really quickly, and since it was so hard to reset the time, I just threw the first one out. The second one never started working when the batteries were put in.The temp readout seemed ridiculous in my car, far warmer than I think it really was when the a/c was on.They give you velcro to put on this little bump on the back, but it wasn't enough velcro to stick in my car...it kept falling off.WASTE OF MONEY."
2,still not good,"I read him when he was first published and I just read him again.I don't think he's any good. Especially, when he was first released, you have to keep in mind that at that time, if it didn't make much sense if was always considered good. Not to say that that didn't work some times. I just don't feel that it worked here.His writing, especially his poetry is so one dimentional that if there is any interest generated it doesn,t stay with you and soon you wonder why you ever liked it in the first place. Kind of like most ""pop"" rock. It's catchy and you might like it for a few listens but then it's time to find something with more guts."
2,"A lot of hype, not very good","I bought this book after my brother-in-law recommended it but was not impressed. Some of the stories are somewhat entertaining, but most seem pointless or weird for the sake of being weird."
1,Drivel,"I got through about 55 pages or so and could not force myself to go on. I liked the music of the 60's but the quasi-intellectual nonsense and philosophy that came out of that period is, in my opinion, a joke -- not to be taken seriously. This work fits right in with the truckload of other work from that period. The writer ended by blowing his head away with a 44-magnum which I would probably have to do myself if I wrote stuff like this for a living."
4,Love it,"My husband and purchased the map to help us visualize our next move. The mountain ranges, bodies of water, large cities and some smaller cities are well depicted. Counties, larger road ways and larger national parks are seen."
5,Nice Map,Nice Map plan to use to plan a trip. Bought a nice tri-fold cardboard to mount it on. I bought the cardboard from Michales
4,large and useful,"I've wanted a large U.S. map for awhile now and saw this one. It was laminated, large,cheap, and has useful info on the map. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because the ""lamination"" if you chose to call it that is very thin. I'm going to take it to my local print shop and have them laminate it with the thick stuff so it wont get wrinkles or any tears/damage."
3,PAPER map.,"The size, color, clarity, shipping time, price are just great! BUT, this may be good if you have only grown-up children. The paper is so thin that your toddler may tear up or scribble on it and you cannot use it anymore! I wish I bought the laminated one. but come on...., the price is just double. so, I have to compromise....if you dont care about spending about 4,5 extra dollars, I would suggest you to go for the laminated one, though it is said to be very thin lamination."
3,"decent product, bad packaging","We bought this map for our home classroom and it looks like it will be a perfect addition. It's laminated, works great with dry erase or wet erase markers, but it WILL come damaged. Many of the reviews comment on this point, but I decided to find out for myself. Well, I got what I deserved. The seller packages this map in a flat, rectangular cardboard package that creases the heck out of the map. It's flimsy and so the post office seems to go out of its way to fold it every which way. The map is functional, but I don't know if we'll ever get the creases out. It's not the worst thing in the world except that it's so avoidable. I can't understand why they wouldn't just ship it in a tube. That would solve the issue entirely. Buyer beware. Note also that this map is shipped from a third party seller, and so it is not eligible for free shipping. The fact that I PAID for them to ship it in a manner that was sure to damage the product also got my dander up."
1,Cannot deliver on promise,"I ordered this map over 3 months ago. FINALLY, after not receiving the item in the timeframe promised, I received an email that the sender could not make good on their sale/delivery promise."
3,Not much detail,"I was expecting much more detail on national parks and landmarks. Devils Tower and others are not shown on the map. Also I really dislike the way highways are shown on the map. Instead of being a thick blue line for interstates, the map shows two faint gray lines with the base color in between. Bottom line...it it a step up from flipping pages on an atlas, I wouldn't recommend it, and I'm going to keep my eyes out for a better one."
3,Not as described by those who purchased,"The details of the map were almost non-existent. So I relied on what the reviewers said. Mistake.Reviews stated that you could write on it with a dry marker. That the lamination was not the best quality, but satisfactory. When the map arrived, I thought I received the wrong item. There is no lamination at all! Another of life's lessons learned. The map would be nice under glass, but it is paper. Thin paper."
3,A good decoration map,"An inexpensive map for family room wall and used as a preliminary guide of directions, distance and points of interest. This map does not clearly highlight the major highways and cities that makes it less useful for travel planning."
4,Good map,"Nice big easy to see map. Not as highly detailed as some AAA maps but it does the job. Only drawback is that it only shows major freeways and they are somewhat hard to see.Besides that it's good if you need a map of the US. If you need a map of the US and all roads, this might not be what you're looking for."
3,"nice map, wrong size info at Amazon","THe map is great, however, the description on Amazon says Product Dimensions: 23 x 15.6 x 10.5 inches. Not exactly sure how a flat map has 3 dimensions so it is totally misleading. The map turns out to be 50""x32"", actually too large for what it wanted. I was hoping one of the two sets of dimensions would turn out to be right. Where they got that information, who knows?"
5,nice wall map,"My boyfriend and I bought this for his brother and his family (with 3 kids), based on it being on the amazon.com wish list. The family was happy to receive it and immediately put it up on the family room wall. It is very colorful and clearly marked/easy to read. The older kids (ages 13 and 9) enjoyed searching it in order to answer a range of questions about the US their uncle posed to them."
1,Bad Packaging,"Product came to me folded and wrinkled. Would have returned if it was a more expensive item, but this one was not worth my time."
2,crinkled upon arrival,"The map itself is quite nice, which is the only thing keeping me from giving this a one-star rating. Two things really stand out, and most other reviewers have already noted these:- this product is shipped in an envelope, not a cardboard tube like the world map from swiftmap that I ordered (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006I59E8/ref=oss_product). Officemap really needs to fix this because my map arrived with all sorts of crinkles in it. If it weren't such a hassle, I would return the map.- the lamination is not true lamination -- it's more like what you get when you buy inexpensive glossy photo paper for your inkjet printer, if not thinner. I won't be using any dry-erase markers on this map unless I cover it with plexiglass or some other laminate."
5,Nice Map,This map is easy to read and laid out well. It is also easy to write on this map with dry erase markers. This makes it very useful.
4,US Rolled Map,The map itself is excellent. It is very colorful and the states are clear and simple to read. However the way it was sent damaged it so that when I took it out of the box it had crease marks. I was a bit disappointed as you can see it when you look at it on the wall.
1,wrong item,I ordered a round steak plate (see image) and received an oval shaped platter exactly like one I have. I kept it rather then go through the return process.
5,"Bringing me new peace, compassion and coping abilities","I listen to these CDs in my car while driving to and from work. The is the right time for me, and I am receptive. The quality of the recording is good, even though it is live. His voice is very beautiful and clear. I am extremely grateful. I am a Buddhist. Anything that helps me is a very good thing. Each time I listen to it, it is fresh an new. It is teaching me how t o find happiness by being present to the moment, and so give more happiness to others. Since I was raised as a Christian, his references to Christianity are especially helpful."
2,Not a Meditation Tape,"What I was looking for was audio meditation. What I got was four hours of talking about meditation. All good intentions aside, the audio was completely boring and the author had the tendency to repeat simple concepts over...and over...and over... Would not recommend unless for some reason this was for what you were looking."
2,Don't waste your money,I bought this product for my dad for christmas. He enjoys blues music and is beginning to play the guitar. The description CLEARLY states that it comes with a 29 page booklet. All I got was the DVD. I want to send it back but I do not have the time since christmas is right around the corner and this is one of two gifts I have for him. I have not played the DVD so who knows it if even works....What a piss poor company to advertise something and not include it. They must not want any customers ever again. DO NOT BUY!!!
2,Not as I expected,"I was looking for an instructional DVD that showed me how to play the guitar with step by step illustration for chords, finger picking, etc., but it didn't have any of that. I also tried to access the online help and it was not available."
4,Take your time going through the lesson!,"Good for beginners! Just make sure you take your time practicing each part away from the lessons, you have to set aside time to actually learn!"
5,A good Start,"The greatest thing about this dvd is that the teacher, teaches you how to play modern styles. I haven't checked out many beginner acoustic dvds, but i have looked threw many beginner guitar books. I think these modern ideas are much better than playing ""Mary Had A Little Lamb"" and ""Old Mc Donald"". With added booklet and online refrences you can advance more. Although you may want to get a few others books a dvd is important too I think. Well worth the money!"
4,Pretty cool way to learn guitar,"Fairly easy to follow and great instructors. This makes learning the guitar ""cool"" by learning in your own home and a heck of a lot cheaper too than taking lessons!"
5,Easy to understand!,"There are lots of self-teaching DVD's out there, but this one is really great and easy to follow along."
5,My favorite yoga video,This program is one that I do at home over and over again. I had to purchase it again because I wore out the first dvd I bought.
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I watched this dvd first and thought that Eoins' voice would be irritating and distracting. Not the case. The sequencing is nice and moves at a good pace. It has several different poses that are are not in any of my other yoga dvd's. Filmed on the beach. The two students were ""real"" people. Yoga is about your here and now, and it was nice to seem the students quiver and not be able to reach their leg straight to the heavens. I would recommend this dvd to someone who has the basics and understands proper alignment in common poses as Eoin doesn't offer much instruction. One draw back.......the 7 practices are all the same.....just ""chapters"" added or removed to change the length of your practice."
2,Pretty simple,"I am a big fan of Eion Finn, but I didn't like this DVD too much. It's simply a short workout with standard poses filmed near the beach rather plainly. There are no real interesting pose combinations, not much in the way of inspiring commentary, and the scenery and the filming doesn't add anything.If you want to try a great disc, try Eion's Yoga for Happiness-it's my favorite! His latest Blissology 6 DVD series is also excellent. I imagine this disc might be OK for someone new to yoga."
2,Does not line up with total truth (in my book),"The main message of healing yourself because of your WILL & DESIRE to live & be well is agreed on from this reader. However, much of what she peppers around that message is not my train of thought. That is NOT to say that others will not obtain help from this audio book. The affirming readings to speak over one's self can be recieved as words of life...I simply take mine from the Bible."
3,"It's good, I guess","This mp3 player is not bad. It haven't been able to install the disk that came with the cd player since my pc is opperating on a windows 98. You can still make mp3 cd's with other softwares like nero. It just takes more time. The sound quality for the mp3 are good but you will only hold around 200 songs if you want it that way. The design is terrible and the buttons don't work well. Still, if you want an mp3 player, this isn't that bad of a choice since it is not that expensive."
2,Bad Sound Quality,"The sound quality is just bad. I have a dying, 9-year old-sony discman that I used as comparison (w/same cd and headphones) and the dying, grinding, gasping discman still had much better sound quality than the NE510. I'm returning it."
2,...was that noise there before?,"I was excited at finding this cd/mp3 player, at the price it is. It's very cute, and I love the jog dial fro easy song access. I do have quite a few gripes, though. First off, I could only fit 380 songs on my mp3 cd (not that I'm really complaining about this), but the cd took literally 3 hours to burn. Why, I have no clue. Many mp3s won't play off the disk now, which is disappointing. In the end, the disk only plays 270 songs. The sound quality is horrible, too. There's an odd, rather metallic clicking noise in the background with the bass, now. It's really irritating, and I recognize it from other cheap mp3 players I've owned before. I'm considering returning it and spending more on a better mp3/cd player. I'm really disappointed with this product, I mistrusted the Sony label, evidently."
3,Awsome but.........,OK Well i just got this thing for Christams and its great. But it is sooo totally confusing!!! i've been tying to figure it out for liek hours on end. I read the manual twice but nothing. All these thoings keep popping up on my computer and i have no clue why. I have a question IS THIS AN MP3 PLAYER OR NOT???? I hope it is becouse thats why i bought it. If it is then how on earth do you work it. I called my friends and family but they're stuck in the dark ages. I reallly need to figure it out! I have such a variety in music and so many CD's that an MP3 player would make my life simpler. HELP!
5,Response,"In response to another review, I used an old MP3 CD from my other MP3 CD player and it worked. I created that CD with Roxio and didn't need to change the files using the software that came with this product.So far I have had no trouble with it and it has much better skip protection then my old MP3 player. Overall I would say it gives you all you need in an MP3/CD player."
1,Not useful,This had nothing I could use. The decorations were juvenile and the recipes could be obtained anywhere.
2,Repaints - already?,"It's a bad sign that the second Superman figure released by Mattel is nothing more than a repaint of one issued only weeks before. That first figure, which I call ""true blue Superman,"" was accurate to his look in the first season of the ""Justice League"" TV series, and had Supes in his trademark blue costume. This version (let's call him ""blackout Superman"") is the same toy, only with his suit black instead of blue, and his 'S' chest symbol red on a black background instead of red on yellow. Blackout Superman offers no new accesories, and no special features. The only reasons I can see for buying this are that you can't find the ""true blue"" version, or are one of those obsessive collectors who HAVE to have every version of every toy (I'm not one of them). A better deal: get the Justice League's Javelin 7 spacecraft, which has electronic features, AND a True Blue Superman figure free!"
2,Not worth it...,"Not very good at getting one to where they think this book will take them. Not very well organized. It is just another showcase for the artists that produced it... keep looking. It's presentation suggest it's all about them, not the wanna bee blues player. Not a quality item. I know, I have reviewed more than 40 such learning books in blues guitar. This one is not as effective as it should be."
4,House of Blues Beginner,Arrived in good time and am very happy with the dvd. bought a 3 disc set by the same author months ago and very happy with it also.
2,Much better titles are available.,"This has very basic information, and is not very deep. Also, more of a rock-blues then blues per say. Try ""Blues you can use"", or Blues Rhythm Guitar by Keith Wyatt for better information (although neither have a DVD with it, but do include a CD to listen)."
4,Very easy to follow,"Some DVD's you buy just cannot be grasped by beginner to intermediate guitarists.But this one is really easy to follow. He even has numbers on the frets of his guitarso he doesn't have to keep saying put your finger on the nth fret...That alone is helpful.But it is more than that. He teaches you in easily absorbable blocks, so you can actuallyimprove and learn as you go. Then after you get the basics, you learn the tricks, the scales,etc, he rolls it all into a real blues riff, that is actually fairly complicated, but as longas you learn it in chunks, no probs. Before you know it, you are playing the riff along withthe band (backing track). And there is more.. Also the link to the backing tracks worked out greatas I downloaded all the tracks in one swoop and use them often, and they sound professional. The bestpart about the tracks is you can remove whatever track you want, bass, drums, lead, whatever, or addany or all. I imagine I will buy more of the DVD's in this lineup...."
1,lots of flash no meat,"If your trying to learn blues techniques your waisting your time with these videos. The instructor is a excellent guitar player but there is no real thought given on the best way to teach you, although in the end it doesn't matter because there really isn't much to be learned from them anyway. If your a novice your just going to get frustrated watching someone play things you'd like to learn but are never taught and if you are familiar with blues techniques there wont be anything in these videos you probably don't already know. I learned way more watching free lessons on you tube. For now I think I'll go back to lessons from local music teachers and musicians around town , cost more but you get what you pay for."
2,Not A Good Method,This method is not very well organized and is not something a person trying to learn the blues with something that can help them grow along the way. There are a few things of use but not much for the price. The flashy dvd guitar playing is over done and not necessary. People buy this stuff so that they can learn and not something to watch someone else show them how good they are after years of playing. I would not recommend this to anyone but would advise them to look for something with better instruction and not just bits and pieces. Try something with a book/cd like the book by John Ganapes...Blues You Can Use. It is put together as a real teaching method.
5,SIMPLY THE BEST!,"I have been playing guitar since 1983. For many years, I have been looking for an instructional device that will help me get to another level. Once I got past the firt couple of chapters that did not teach me anything new, the whole rest of it was EXACTLY what I have been looking for. For a beginner, the entire DVD is going to be a must. McCarthy is an excellent guitarist, who plays with a pleasant variety and doesn't sound at all generic. The overall architecture of these lessons has been so well planned, that the end-user is taken on an easy and enjoyable learning path. It's not exactly ""the blues,"" but it IS the BEST instructions for learning rock guitar, which is founded from the blues anyway. Definitely buy this series, it's well worth every penny!"
2,Phee-yew,"Four short romance stories that all had resolutions which were obvious; unsubtle and (worst sin of all) boring. Don't waste your time or money. The last story by Joan Johnston had the most interesting plot, and that gains my 2 stars. But even it was predictable and lacked tension."
5,Terrific double-CD set,"Almost 2 hours of some of the best of Baroque music. A great deal of Vivaldi, some good Bach and Handel plus Pachelbel's Canon. No Telemann though."
4,Murphy's Law...the first one was defective!,"I have no complaints about the shipping, and I'm sure it was not obvious to the shipper that this fuse was defective. After inserting this part, our printer quality got much worse, and we called in a repairman to take a look. He quickly came to the conclusion that the part was defective...bummer. Not only had we spent over $200, we also had to pay him and reorder the part. Happily, it came quickly and it's all good. Thanks, Amazon!"
5,SUPERB CHORAL WORK BY SOLTI!!,The Missa Solemnis doesn't get any better than this 1978 Grammy Award winning version. The choral work is FABULOUS. The Soloists are FANTATISTIC!!!!!The Mass in C though needs improvement. The Gardiner version of the Mass in C is better.
5,Superb,"This Missa is absolutely superb. Outstanding recording and playing from one of the world's greatest conductors. At an incredible price too.The Kyrie is beautifully sung. The soloists are unmatched. Popp is just fantastic and is Minton.The Chicago Symphony Chorus and Orchestra demonstrates why they are considered the best orchestra in the world. Solti too demonstrates why he is considered one of the greatest conductors in the world.And of course, we have the famous Decca sound - unmatched. And absolute MUST HAVE CD. Even if you have all the other versions of Missa, this CD is a MUST MUST"
5,AWESOME!!!,"Solti has shown himself to be just what he is reputed to be - the greatest conductor in the world. In the superconductor class with Karajan and Bernstein.As an opera conductor, Solti has the advantage over many other conductors who conduct only orchestras.If you want a Large Scale Missa Solemnis, this is THE VERSION to get. I have 9 different 'Large Scale versions and this is by far the best. Awesome Choir. Awesome Soloists. Awesome Orchestra. Awesome conducting. Awesome recording. Awesome price.If you want period instrument Missa, get Gardiner."
4,Fun viewing and learning,"This is wonderful, very fun to watch and a great resource for the Martha Stewart fans! I only wish they had added more recipes and fewer craft ideas, although the whole thing is definitely very enjoyable!"
4,Martha's Holidays 2005,"Lots of short segments with lots of ideas tips and suggestions. There's no option to ""play all"" so each segment has to be selected from the menu individually. You can't just sit down and watch the video. Other than that, it's pure Martha. If you like her shows, you won't be disappointed in the content."
5,Great camera!,"This is my second digital camera. I love it, it's easy to use and takes great pictures! I have no complaints yet (only had it for 2 weeks!) So far so good!"
5,Surprising and Oh So Satisfying,I've never heard free jazz swing this hard. These are a great records that will challenge any preconceptions you might have about music.
5,"Solo, Michel Camilo",Another demonstration of a master technician displaying his creative composition skill in a variety of modes.
3,Not one of Camilo's best,"We prefer his uptempo, smoking piano playing, on albums like ""One More Once."" This material is very slow."
3,average,"enough with the mumbo jumbo terms from the other guy. i'll write this review in plain english. I found this cd to my distaste sad to say. Don't get me wrong, Michel camilo is my favorite jazz pianist, he rocks out on piano! but on this cd, he is laid back, the songs he plays are like, cocktail party genre, not very active, intense, flair ups, octave voicings that im used to hearing. he plays gently, like slow songs, not much dramatic activity on the piano. if you like to hear relaxed laid back voicings on piano, then you might like this CD. me personally, like to hear him fire up on the piano, so this Cd was not for me."
1,This is crap $10 to the trash,"Very bad first impression...I haven't tried them yet, I took off the plastic that covers it, then I open the cap, the seal for your protection was open it is obvious that someone opened the pills and went through them, also there was no cotton inside, usually most do, and i counted all the pills myself in case there was any missing. This looks like a scam already...Also the Supplement Facts, 1350 mg per bottle as you can see above on the picture advertised. I received it, it was exactly the same, i thought they probably made an error on the picture above. I was like WTF it has all these ingredients but how MUCH of IT. So i came to a conclusion that it doesn't have none of the ingredients it state. DONT BUY IT, Im going to try them and if I notice any changes ill write another review, BUT so far not worth it!!! All the good reviews are more likely written by the seller himself or his friends so they can fool people."
3,The One,"It wasn't the biggest improvement, but I do see change and plus I think it made me a little more ripped."
2,Carolina,"Does work, but dnt buy them until you ask your doctor, these does work but it made my husband not feel like having sex after some weeks."
2,not really worth it,this item is not really worth it considering how cheap it is its nice but not very much result it might also be that ive been stacking alot of supplements so maybe i didnt notice a change.
2,Does not deliver,Does absolutely nothing. It isd just a placebo to make you think you are doing something for your manhood. It does not work. It is a scam.
4,Matt Serra Proved All the Doubters WRONG!,"The biggest disappointment of this card was the Koschek/Sanchez fight. A major letdown for what should have been a slugfest. However, the main event made up for it, as Matt ""The Terror"" Serra made all the doubters and skeptics eat a major slice of crow by shocking the world and upsetting a very talented and capable George ""Rush"" St. Pierre to win the welterweight title. (SIDE NOTE: Travis Lutter, TUF 4 middleweight winner who blew a golden opportunity by failing to make weight for his bout against middleweight champ Anderson Silva, should take a lesson from Serra.)As good a Serra is, nobody gave him a snowball's chance in the hot spot of winning. It just goes to show how unpredictable MMA is. Serra's TKO victory over GSP (who, by the way, has nothing to feel bad about and I'm sure will be back in winning form before long) was just one in a series of stunning UFC upsets.Overall, it was a pretty good fight card."
1,UFC fixed fight?,"For those who haven't seen it, I won't spoil it here. This card features a fight that could have been fixed. Hopefully this won't be MMA's first steps toward copying the crooked boxing world."
2,Rather wooden and lacking in a sense of style,"This recording is now ten years old, and is interesting as a document of how scholarship was back then, but our understaning of the performance of French Classical organ music has moved on somewhat. Use of 'Notes Inegales' for example is not consistent. Rather a four square perfomance. If you just want to hear how this instrument sounds it is an excellent disc exploring the full range of the instrument."
3,No Auto Shutoff,They claim it has auto shutoff but this UPS does not have a data fort so there is no way to properly run this. Besides that the price is good but wrong information is never good.
1,Unsatisfied,"I ordered this part then found a cheaper price on another website and canceled my order with amazon, but they did not cancel it and a month later i get an email saying they just shipped it. So i get the intake and not only did they not cancel my order but sent me the wrong intake, this was my first time using amazon and most likely the last. The shipping time on the intake was literally a month when i bought it from amazon, but when i bought it from USautoparts, i ordered it monday and had it by friday."
2,"Good Subject, horrible writing~","I am SO disappointed in this 'biography'! I can't believe the publisher actually published it! The subject is great, but the writing leaves MUCH to be desired. In fact, I felt as though I were reading a high school report on Tanner, instead of a professional writer. Myers tends to jump around in time periods, repeat things, use overtly obtuse language at times and the flow is... nonexistant.An editor had to have been fired after this one. As fascinating as the subject may be, this book reads like a text. Check it out of the Library before the Amazon line. It's a snoozer."
5,Superb,"While a couple of the reviewers here are busy nitpicking things they don't like about this book, they miss the point -- there never HAS been a biography of Patrick Dennis before, and Eric Myers has done a superb job of breaking that silence. I suppose, with an author as well-loved as Dennis, it's inevitable that some of his hardcore fans feel Myers' work doesn't measure up to the imaginary biography they've carried around in their heads all these years. But that shouldn't steer readers away from a very accomplished piece of work that also happens to be great fun to read."
3,"Right Book, Wrong Title","After pages and pages devoted to explaining that Tanner/Dennis had ambivalent feelings to the Mame machine AND that Mame's nephew was not the author himself AND that he came to loathe being buttonholed about her, why name the book UNCLE MAME? Tanner's life was not one of non-stop fabulousness and madcap antics. Tanner railed against his homosexuality for years and suffered a ""nervous breakdown"" because of his inability to accept himself. He spent like a drunken sailor and drank even more. Hardly an Uncle Mame."
5,"Wonderful Book for anyone anytime, not just Christmas.","Great book, enjoyable quick read. Not only a cute Christmas story, but reveals the true meaning of Christmas. Recommend for anyone."
1,Unfortunately I found no value in this,"I was disappointed by the other reviews that led me to buy it. If you do want to purchase it, consider buying my copy on sale on Amazon for $9.95. But I dont suggest you buy it! Why? Because there is no logic or credibility to the content. She seems to simply have an interesting way of talking and an ability to manufacture terminology. She's ""America's premier medical intuitive"" probably because she's the America's only medical intuitive. :)"
4,Relaxing Sounds,I love to listen to this before bed. It helps me relax. The music is beautiful. i recommend purchasing it.
2,From Mykonos to Madrid,"Several years ago, I purchased the earlier version of this CD by the Sahnas brothers and thought it was excellent. I especially liked the way they played Tico Tico, and so did everyone else that heard it. Unfortunatly, that CD was stolen and is no longer available for purchase. Although the new edition of their CD has a pretty cover, their style of playing the guitar changed for the worse. I was especially disappointed at the way they now play ""Tico Tico."" Had I known this at the time, I never would have bought this CD. I just wish they hadn't changed their earlier, outstanding style of playing the guitar."
3,Sliding into Home Book Review,"This was an enteresting book about a girl trying to play baseball. Joelle Cunningham has just moved to a new town, Greendale, Iowa. At her new school, Hover Middle School, she can only play softball and not baseball. At hoover girls only play softball. Joelle only wants to play baseball. She tries to make the school change their policy, but they won't. She starts writing letters to the paper all about how they are not the same sport. She was so happy when she met another bunch of girls who also want to play baseball. Then Joelle had a great idea she wanted to start her own girls baseball league. Once they finally get enough people to play the police tell her she can't play on the field she wanted to. S she talks to an old woman who will let them use her properity. They finally get to play their first game and they one."
4,"good, but too $%^# fast","Its a good thang i have cd turntables so i can adjust the pitch of this down to a listenable level (-5 or -6).That being said this cd is a darn must have if you like a$$ shakin' breaks. I have been listening to this dj since N.C. fell in love with him in the late 90's - early 2000's. I first heard him at a 'Flavor' party i believe (it was his Club 2000 cd release party, which btw is the best breaks album ever thrown on cd) and i remember.......hehe.... fighting with a girl after his set for the promo cd's that they were throwing out to the crowd.......da*& that is some good memories. Anyway i regress, get this and you will not be dissapointed, there are some soft yet groovy tracks ie #4 and the slammin' tracks are #7,9,11,15,16. And for you people that can't get enuf of 80's remixes he brings another stunner with 'Radio rockin' #15.Dance music can be fun and cool at the same time and the Xquizit DJ X does it again."
2,How practical is this?,Radio works but the AC adapter is unavailable so forget about plugging this puppy in. It's a pure portable.
4,"Not perfect, but not bad.","Over all, I like this product.The only problems are:-Some CDs that play fine in my car and other stereos seem to skip frequently on this device.-The sound becomes distorted when it is turned up loud. I like to listen to music loud while in the shower, so that might not be a problem if you don't want it very loud.Overall, I love having a radio in the bathroom.The radio stations come in very well, and the sound quality is decent."
4,very satisfied,Like most items sony puts out this is good quality. It will go through batteries a little faster than I expect but I purchased rechargeables which works great.
5,Best Shower Radio I've ever known,"I looked around a bit for a good shower radio and stumbled across this item. For months I put off buying it because I did not need it, but eventually I bought it for myself as a Christmas present. I am not disappointed. I've had it for almost 5 months and the batteries are still good and I listen to it for hours most days - through showers, baths and just cleaning around the house. The stations come in very well and I like that I can have some programmed because it's quick and easy to go from news to morning motivation music. The speakers are good and I don't need to blast the radio while the water is running. It's light for portability yet very durable, solid and looks great. I did buy it thinking there was an alarm clock feature, but was slightly disappointed when I found out that it was just a timer. That's the only complaint that I have, but I think one of the reviews on another site said there was an alarm, so that was a mistake. I love it!"
4,Best Shower Radio,"Pros: Reception, Features, all digital, looks, build like a tank.Cons: Price.I picked this up to replace a piece of junk Curtis shower radio I bought my wife from Best Buy. She was so dissapointed in the Curtis because no stations would come in on its analog tuner.The Sony was everything the cheaper Curtis wasn't. It is fully digital including the tuner. It has an external antenna and the reception is great. It sounds great for a littler radio with a even a bit of bass. The auto off feature will let you turn this thing on first thing in the morning and not worry about draining the batteries by leaving it on all day. Aditionally, it comes with a rope strap that will let you hang it from about anything. It is a bit on the heavy side because it is built solid as a rock.The final word is I am super pleased with this little radio. My only gripe is the price: ... ouch. But if you believe that you get what you pay for..."
4,It is great!,"This shower CD Player is great. All features are available at the touch of your finger. That would help when you have soap in your eyes. The radio has a preset feature for your fav channels. Reception is good for stronger channels, but the radio's antenna only can do so so. This unit claims that it is for the shower, but the manual gives instruction not to have near direct water. I haven't chanced it, so I've placed it just out side the shower within my reach. I would definitely recommend this item it is very good quality."
4,Shower radio review,"Sony ICF-CD73V Shower CD Player/Clock Radio (White)This is a great product, with good clarity. My only criticism is that it's a bit heavy, and the suction cup for the antenna doesn't hold."
3,"Clock Radio does not work, but...","My clock radio does not turn on anymore; the only thing I can do is set the clock. I've tried resetting it and changing the batteries, but it still does not work. The clock radio was working great until this. It is also kind of pricey for what it is, but I think it still may be one of the better clock radios out on the market. Another thing that kind of bugs me about this clock radio is that the display is hard to see, it is not lit up. I read on the Sony website that it has a LCD display, but I don't have that. The radio also can't be knocked around too much because the CD will pause for a few seconds and then start right where it left off - It is really no big deal that it pauses.--I sent my radio back to Sony, it still had its warranty, which is 1 yr, and it was repaired and sent back in about a week. Now it works like it did when I bought it."
2,Not reliable in my experience,"I saw all of the positive reviews of this Sony shower radio/cd player and thought it important to share my experience. I bought one two years ago and although the quality seemed to be high (solid construction, good waterproofing design) it broke pretty quickly. Within around ten months the cd player stopped working, and then eventually so did the radio. It was disappointing because I thought spending the money on a Sony ensured a reliable product. Maybe it's because it's a shower radio and was exposed to a lot of steam, but it seemed like a lot of money for a stereo that lasted 10 months, and is supposed to be designed to withstand a bit of water. I expected more and would not buy one again.It was great while it worked though."
1,"okay in the beginning, but...","This thing worked okay in the beginning (but by no means an exceptional product, just okay). This was my first shower CD player purchase, I'm guessing in general there are no great products out there if this mediocre thing was rated so high. The problem is after a couple months the display wasn't working anymore. And then today (after a few months) the clasp that closes the CD lid was so rusted it come off completely. I don't even switch CDs that often, I've only openned and closed that thing 10 times tops in the last few months. It wasn't cheap either to be falling apart like this... You would think they would know water+metal=rust. Going to try one of the cheap ones next ... if its only going to last 6 months I at least want it to be cheap!"
5,GREAT RADIO/CD,...very good bath radio with good sound and sturdy feel; also good amount of station presets. A quality buy.
4,I love it,I use my Sony in all rooms. It's sturdy and sound quality is excellent I'm especially appreciative how easy it is to operate and how long the batteries last. I'd definately recommend it to a friend.
4,Good sound,"My teens love the CD player, I use it for the radio. We have it on our bath counter. Good sound. Can hear it even in the shower. Was pricey but if it continues to work it is better than buying cheaper and being unhappy with the product. Time will tell."
5,great shower radio!,"My girls love to listen to music in the bathroom, and they were always lugging in one of their own jamboxes -- so I bought this and they love it! It gets great reception and the quality of music is great with the radio or CD player. I'd buy it again if I needed another one."
1,Space aliens manufactured this model,"So now we see where the aliens from another planet are hiding out here on earth. It must be at the Bowen Hill toy company! Check it out: they learned about how humans were put together by disassembling one, but they had problems getting him back together. Needless to say, if you want to learn accurate anatomical information, go to the people from that planet first, okay? Earth for earthlings, I say! And keep your torso on straight!"
1,I must agree,"Even though I haven't bought this, the skeleton seems horribly deformed. And the worst way to educate a child is to tell them the wong answer. I must agree with the other reiew."
5,Magic Hour,The book came late but it came in one piece and was in good shape-the mail syatem was to blame as it turne dout
1,I prefer a different style of writing and genre.,"I thought this was romance, but it's really a mystery. Readers who love mysteries would probably enjoy this more than I. There were way too much conversation and detail facts to follow. I didn't want my brain to have to work to remember and analyze all the details. I also didn't like this style of writing - all in first person, told from the police detective's perspective. Story brief: Steve is a police detective trying to solve the murder of Sy. He falls in love with Bonnie who is the main suspect.Sexual language: strong. Number of sex scenes: a few (I forgot exactly). Setting: around 1989 The Hamptons. Copyright: 1991. Genre: mystery with some romance."
5,great game to encourage a love of Hebrew,"We love this game! I bought it for my 5 year old who doesn't know Hebrew yet, but is starting to learn her letters. She loves playing this game as a nice variation to Candy Land and I love playing it with her. We are writing our own list of what the words are that start with the various letters. A great buy!"
3,"Not exactly what I expected, but nice","As an interior designer, several of my colleagues mentioned that this was the most requested style from their newer clients. I thought there would be more current interiors, referring to a new style. It was more of a historical chronicle of design in Santa Barbara, for exteriors and interiors. It is a nice book, but not exactly what I expected."
1,Santa Barbara Style,A beautiful book... a must have for anyone who lives in Santa Barbara or just dreams of it!! Great for those of us who are remodeling and have to meet the Arcitectural guidelines of this beautiful city we live in! A true gem of a book!!!
2,Not very inspiring.....,"I had really hoped for an exciting collection of photographs which evoked the sunny carefree Santa Barbara style. Unfortunately, it is primarily composed of photographs of formal highly stylized houses which look like museums. I had wanted to see beach shacks, airy white washed cottages with tons of old rose bushes, cool mediterranean lairs used by Hollywood refugees, grand haciendas overlooking the sea, etc... but this was pretty tame predictable stuff. Such a shame."
2,"Weak. Great idea, lacks substance","Im building a santa barbara style house and I was disappointed. Not a lot of details. Sure some pics of some SB mansions but not enough photos or details to actually do anything with this book. I guess if you are into SB history it might be OK, otherwise save yourself the $. You will be done browsing it in about 10 minutes and never use it again."
2,could not connect,"Sorry, this guy's voice gave me the creeps. He sounds like a preacher. Who can meditate without the ability to respond positively to the leading voice."
2,Use caution in beginning meditation.,"My friend loaned me the book and CD. She couldn't use it anymore, as after her third attempt at meditation with the CD, she had afrightening experience with Kundalini rising. Energy was travelling up her spine in a frightening manner. A trusted advisor suggested that meditation is best learned with an experienced Yoga master if you have any signs of Kundalini rising. This friend had recently been attuned for Reiki level two. Please read up about the awakening of Kundalini and its usual symptoms, so that you will recognize the signs if they occur to you!"
3,Dusty Springfield CD,Very disappointing. Selection of songs not what I expected.Not much else I can say about this CD as I do not have 20ways of saying disappointing.
4,The Second Death of George Mallory: The Enigma and Spirit of Mount ......,"Always Reinhold Messner's books are worth reading and owning. He is a excellent writer, and gives a broad view of many subjects. This one is quite different in subject matter, and worth considering, I agreed with his premise that MT Everest had been contaminated into a commercial enterprise.... to me Everest seems to be a graveyard and refuse dump."
2,Disappointing,The book was at times written as though it was the author was George Mallory and also written as though it was Reinhold Messner himself which made reading confusing and hard to follow. As english may not be the authors first and only language the book may have suffered in translation
5,I'm back to buy another copy...,"The copy my company owns is so good, I decided to buy one for myself! This is an excellent reference to SQL and database design in general, from a basic discussion of the normal forms to the most complex applications of SQL. I use it as a learning tool as well as a reference. It features easy, understandable examples and discussions of the real-world differences between databases, application servers, and development techniques. Highly recommended."
1,Save yourself some $$$,"And just read the SQL reference in whatever DB product you have (Oracle, SQL Server, Informix, etc). Nothing new here except added verbiage which just takes longer to sift through."
5,lets all make a porno...,"what can i say, i LOVE this movie...blu really rocks visually and audio is a cutabove the rest.one of the bestest comedies to date.get it, pornos rule."
5,Awesome,"This movie is hysterical, but not for those who don't enjoy soft core porn. Other than 1 over the top gross scene, Zack & Miri & crew are fabulous & funny. A Great ride."
3,"Funny, but not over the top hysterical",If you enjoy Kevin Smith humor this is a worthy watch. With some funny but predictable lines it was fun but not exactly side splitting. Not sure why I got the two disc edition as I doubt I will ever watch the bonus features.
4,Nasty and dirty. Also hysterical!,Zack and Miri make a porno is hilarious! They are poor and they come up with an idea to make money...make a porno. Not for the easily offended. This is a totally perverted movie. Seth Rogan cracked me up...like always...through the whole movie. Definitely recommended for people with a sexual sense of humor.
1,Not that good,This movie was just not that good. It just didn't come together and it just didn't work. It had some really crude stuff and some of it even gave me a chuckle here and there but this movie was a miss.
1,Semi-entertaining,"I guess I expected more from this movie, but it ended up being merely a one-liner based movie. Besides some fun lines or dialogues there is very little substance.The funny scenes are mostly juvenile old toilet humour and vulgar pee-jokes.The filmography is also disappointing and this is in no way of the quality-level of previous Kevin SDmith movies (Clerks, Mallrats...)Terrible movie. I don't undertsand how it got 7.3 on IMDB."
4,For couples only...,"This film is pretty funny stuff and a must see if you are into Kevin Smith's brand of humor--or if you're into pr0n--whichever. It really pokes fun at the pr0n industry (no pun) and hits on stereotypes about M/F friendships. A fun time spent, for sure."
2,"Sleezy, perverted, profane, some laughs","If you don't mind horrendous language, degrading behavior, and a cast of ignorants, have fun! Yes, this is a Kevin Smith movie on steroids!"
4,Awesome Movie,Worth the steep price for instant streaming. The only regret I have with this film is that I didn't think ahead and rent it from somewhere cheaper.

4,"Great film, disappointing DVD(no commentary or unrated version)","First off, I should point out that I'm a Kevin Smith fan, as well as a movie buff.As the first, I am not disappointed in the movie at all. It has all the great dialogue and humor you would expect from a Kevin Smith film. It also shows the improvements in narrative storytelling evident in recent Smith films like Clerks II. The cast is fantastic, and their acting is too. Craig Robinson steals almost every scene he's in, and even Jason Mewes steps up his chops now that he's sober.As the second, I am very disappointed. We get a 2 Disc edition of the movie, but it doesn't come with a feature commentary or an Unrated edition. The amount of bonus features doesn't even necessitate a 2nd disc, as far as I can tell. I'm fairly certain there'll be another edition soon, which I will reluctantly buy just to have those two things."
4,Great laugh out loud comedy,I saw this movie in theater and absolutely loved it. I laughed so hard I could hardly breathe. Everyone in this film are some of my favorite actors and actresses. I've seen this movie so many times since I've gotten this DVD. I highly recommend this movie especially if you are a Kevin Smith fan.
3,kevin smith is funnier than judd apatow...why did he do this???,"apatow can basically do one type of humor, and kevin smith is a f***king genius....SO WHY IN THE WORLD DID HE DO THIS?????plus, it's basically just a chick flick that's a little on the racey side."
1,Hey Gang!,"The basics of this movie are like a Judy Garland/Mickey Rooney plot: ""we need the money, and let's put on a show!"" It doesn't get any worse.And it doesn't get better, either. Seth Rogan without clothing isn't anything to marvel at. Neither is the plot, the lack of empathy or the predetermined ending. Subtle as a brick."
2,zack and miri make a not so good movie,"So, i was hoping for the better with this movie as i have been very disappointed with kevin smith movies since he ended the trilogy, but the better did not happen. It had ok moments, but that was about it. It seemed as though he was trying to be a bit like the apatow brand movies, but couldn't pull it off as well. i like the concept of the movie and the cast, but it just didn't seem like he thought it through well enough."
4,Cute in a Misbegotten Way,"Bored, underemployed, and confused about themselves, Mira and Zack decide to round up a cast of their impoverished acquaintances for an X movie to solve some of their problems. In the end the eclectic group realizes they actually like each other and exit as impoverished friends instead of impoverished acquaintances. I agree with other reviews. The characters are likeable and convincing enough to make the movie cute in a misbegotten way. The sex is totally simulated and the nudity is limited to breasts that manage to be gratuitous in spite of the porno theme. Those gratuitous breasts, however, are worth the price of the rental."
5,Cute Movie,"Cute. My wife likes it more than I do, but it is well-made and.. nice. It's not really dirty. If you like this, you might also try the ""Amateurs,"" with Jeff Bridges. Same kind of plot, but a little less... coarse."
2,i couldnt get this to work.,"i tried to watch this on 3 different ps3s and it kept getting stuck on the ""loading"" screen. amazon has a great return process, so i requested a new copy and got it pretty quickly. however, go figure that the new replacement copy did the exact same thing. i ended up just sending them both back and getting a refund. i have bought lots of blu-rays from amazon and been totally satisfied; this is the first time something like this has happened."
1,Not worth watching. . .,"The story may have been OK had there not been so much foul language. Every other word was ""F*%$"" and it got old really quick. I made it through about 45 minutes and turned it off. Not the least bit funny. . ."
5,Great!,Item was shipped in good shape. Would deal with again. I believe it came pretty fast. Sorry it was a while ago so not completely sure. Sorry it took so long. I thought I already dis the review.
1,The worst Kevin Smith film yet.,"I'm a Kevin Smith fan but I hated this movie. The best part of this movie is the Primus song in the beginning, after that it's straight downhill. I never once laughed out loud throughout the movie. The deleted scenes are much funnier than any of the scenes in the movie. I would recommend renting this before you purchase it."
4,WOW...Great REPLAY VALUE!,"I heard this didn't do well when it was released (monetarily)...but then again..the economy was in the shitter for years since 2005 (Thanks Republicons) and with the cost of a movie ticket these days..well..I only go to the theatre once or twice a year now..so there.I saw this on cable..and really got into it.Whenever I was skimming through channels...and it was on again..I had to stop. It just puts a smile on my face...this one does.Plus if you even just like even a little sex AND/OR star wars humor..this movie is for YOU!!!Anyway..beyond that there are PLENTY of moments that have tremendous replay value...and by the way..the orgasm scene is the best EVER caught on film by an actor. Beats the hell out of When Harry Met Sally's orgasm scene in the diner!My husband and I were ..pleasantly surprised..... by how fun and light this was.REPLAY VALUE!!!Movie is not for: Republicons, Republitards, Conservatives, moral minority, the repressed, the prude and/or evangelicals."
4,"Cheesy, entertaining, different","Never seen any mainstream movie like this before- Storytelling is well done. Cheesy, but they made it work.- Will entertain you, especially with all the semi-awkward laughs it will give you.- Plot isn't very strong; it's the typical struggling couple trying to make money- Gross. Some scenes are pretty gross, not very sexy at all.- Decent script. Although witty and funny, some parts aren't as strong. Sometimes dry and unnecessary.Overall, a very fun movie to watch. Filled with many humorous scenes, it still has it's dull moments though."
3,"Okay, I guess.","I had heard great things about this movie and was excited to watch it. Unfortunately, only the first thirty minutes or so were worth watching. The beginning was hilarious and Justin Long was brilliant! After that, a romance sprang from nowhere and it really made the rest of the movie hard to watch. I felt like I had to sit through the out-of-place romance in order to get to the likeable parts of the movie. On a side note, I also find it hard to believe that the characters of Zack and Miri would be best friends for 20 years and still so awkward around each other. It just made the movie less enjoyable for me. I say watch the first half hour and move on.Three stars only for Justin Long's excellent performance."
3,No Surprises,"This was pretty much what I expected it to be, no more and no less. Kevin Smith has been deeply entrenched in what I like to call his ""mullet years"" for some time now, making movies that want to be hip and sharp-witted for his hardcore fans, but also warm-hearted and dumbed down for the larger audiences he's always missed out on. Its not a recipe for success, or at least for thoughtful moviemaking. Most directors only stumble across something like ""Chasing Amy"" once in their careers, and as much as it disappoints me to realize it, Smith just isn't good enough at what he does to make that happen again. He's bound and determined to try, though, and lukewarm feature-lengths like this one are the end result. It's better than ""Clerks 2"", at least, and was on a good roll in the first act before it veered off into dramaland."
2,disappointing.,"OK, so RAUNCH and lack of morals... OK we all know that.The point is that the acting was really mediocre, and the editing was rubbish. the direction was really poor. there were so many opportunities for funnier jokes...I give it two stars because of 2 reasons:1) Justin Long. a small part, but his acting was actually really good and a big stretch for him. He was really quite funny.2) the shock of seeing Jason Mewes run around naked. It was just funny.The plot was really, well, the title says it all.You know they are gonna fall in love.I'm not sure WHY they thought anyone would want to see this film..."
4,Dreamworld Fantasy,"Anything written by the famous Brothers Grimm is a certainty with the experience of great entertainment. An enjoyment film of a lifetime. If Mr Disney, the king of Childrens stories, thought their work was very creative, then why should we criticize."
3,The Classic Concert Live,"This album is excellent and displays a side of jazz that most people don't know about. The only negatives are 1. The ""Lady be Good track"" is not the one I remember from the past, and 2. Two tracks were damaged, due to poor manufacturing I think. I had to order another one.I also order ""Getz Meets Mulligan"" at the same time. This is a must have for any jazz fan."
2,"Cute, but smelly!","If this is the same as the pad we have, it has an herbal-type scent which turns into a very bad odor when heated. Perhaps we heated it in the microwave for too many seconds, so I would recommend following the heating instructions very carefully. It is cute, and stays warm as long as you would expect for this ""novelty"" type of heating pad."
5,Fantastic Album!,"Oh man, this album is incredible. The songwriting abilities of these teenagers is unbelievable! Sounds like Bowie, Costello, and Roxy Music mixed together!"
4,Achingly brilliant!,This was a stunning read...especially after I read that Ms. Nemirovsky had been arrested and died in Auschwitz in the middle of writing this novel! This is a must-read for anyone who has an interest in fiction and in the Nazi occupation. She has a very interesting perspective on the situation of the Nazi occupation in France -- I was caught up by how carefully she had to write this novel and how dangerous it was for her!
5,An excellent read,"Do not be concerned that this book is not competed; it is still an excellent read. Her writing is intelligent and entertaining, which is a staggering accomplishment considering she never had a chance to polish her completed chapters. The novel provides insight into an interesting time in history (Vichy France), but what makes the novel great is Nemirovsky's ability to provide insight into human nature through her characters' reactions to hardship. The English translation includes future plans for the novel found with the manuscript and correspondence between Nemirovsky, her publisher, her husband, and others that narrate their difficulties during the war. Do not skip over these powerful, heartbreaking passages."
3,Bittersweet,"Wonderfully written with insight into the emotional strain inflicted on people who have no say in times of war. As the characters unfolded, a long process at that, the reader feels a since of hopelessness not so much because of the war but because freedom had been taken from these people. The German soldiers were as much victims of a bad government as the people in occupied France. I'd give this book five stars if it didn't take so long to weed out how the characters were connected. A sense of sadness lingers. Wil A. Emerson"
3,constantreader,This book was recommended to me by a friend who read it for her book club. The book was interesting and held my attention the entire way through. But the ending was horrible. No epilogue. I found myself frantically searching through the discussion questions to see if I had somehow missed the ending. It just stopped. Awful! It made me feel as though I had wasted my time reading it.
4,Haunting,"Yes, it is obvious that it hasn't been edited but that doesn't detract from the beauty. Language is wound like ribbons, outlining the pictures of the characters, framing them and revealing them slowly.The desperation, fear and transient nature of the characters fall off the page, revealing a landscape littered with the machinations of war. Characters come alive in mere fragments of sentences, the nature of war evident on every page, filling the reader with an intense feeling of dread and discomfort.The writing is gifted, delicious and terrific. Not to be missed."
3,Interesting But Fairly Disjointed,"I became aware of this book via NPR and immediately picked it and Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road"". I duitifully read both and while I loved the one, this one I felt was lacking. I feel dreadful given what the author went through (ultimately dying in Auschwitz), however, I am also perplexed by how much editing the original notes underwent to get to the book as it exists now. It seems disjointed. The first part goes one way, the rest takes an entirely different tact, and it ends all too cleanly given the hype that it is unfinished due to the authors demise in Auschwitz. I would not spend my money on this book, but would borrow it from the library to read it for its bits and pieces of a peek into France prior to and during occupation."
5,Lingers in the memory,"I read SUITE FRANCAISE over two years ago, yet it is still in my mind. The first book captures the chaos of the Nazi invasion well, but the second book, in particular, makes it all-too-human. It is quite well-written, and I ended what we have of the planned story feeling robbed because the author did not survive to finish it.I would put this novel on a par with TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and SOPHIE'S CHOICE for the author's ability to evoke time and place."
2,Not Worth the Time,"After reading all the reviews I was hoping it would captivate me. I struggled with not putting it down. Dumbfounded by the reviews, I returned to the scene of the crime and realized I wasn't the only one who felt like it was a waste of time."
2,Don't bother,I'm sorry to say this book never lived up to all the hype for me. None of the characters were appealing. Felt like I was reading short stories by a high school student. I found it very difficult to get through as there was nothing going on to keep my interest.
3,Kind of liked it.,"This fictional book was written by a woman who was living during the Halocaust times and planned on writting 5-7 short fictional stories related to what was happening. She was killed after only two stories were completed, so only those were published. I liked the first story, but it was so depressing that I wasn't up for reading the second of the two stories. I have taken college level ""representing the Halocaust through literature"" and enjoyed the non-fiction and Maus I and II much better than this novel. However, several of my book club members (all women) enjoyed it. About half of them, however, didn't finish it. Books we loved were ""Shadow of the Wind"" (which I think both men and women would enjoy) and ""Daughter of Fortune"" (which I think is a little more of a women oreinted book [like a ""chick-flick, but a , though not completely."
1,Gave up after 150 pages!,"I have to echo the sentiments of those who say there were too many characters and they're not well-developed enough to make you care about them. And what you ARE told about them makes them all completely unappealing! I was certainly expecting some unsympathetic Germans, but I was not expecting that all the French characters would be petty, snobbish and selfish -- at least, what little the author tells you about them. I thought I would love this but didn't bother to finish it."
1,rather pull neddles out of myself (kimberly bowling) (ohio usa),i didnt even finish this book even though despite my best efforts. to many characters to keep track of. and just not enough depth to keep it interesting. i was deeply disapointed.
2,Disapointed in expectations,"I had only heard favorable reviews for this book, so was dissapointed to find out how much I didn't enjoy this book. Too many characters, too disjointed and no ending. All facets of a book I would not recommend. I understand it was supposed to be more books and it may have all tied together, but they weren't written and it wasn't ""wrapped up."" I won't be one to recommend this book to any friends."
1,Suite Francaise,"I found this book exceedingly depressing, and it was very difficult to read. I could not make it through to the end. I did not feel compassion for the characters -- I did not feel anything for them. The book also felt very self-conscious to me, and this was a distraction."
4,SUITE FRANCAISE IRENE NEMIROVSKY,"I had read the book in French, and wanted to share it with my English speaking friends. This translation is so close to the original text, restituting the style so accurately, I sometimes wonder if it is not better than the original...And the glimpse into the horror of French 1940 internal exodus remains frightening, with all the weaknesses, the treachery....... a must read!"
5,absolutely brilliant,"This novel blew me away. The author describes the invasion of France by Germany during WWII through the eyes of different characters. Then, she chronicles the Occupation that follows. I felt almost as if I was there. In the beginning, it is easy to become confused as the author skips from family to family. A bit of extra concentration in this regard is well rewarded. The prose is the highest quality. Buy the book and get ready to be amazed."
3,Disappointed...,"Although the author writes mellifluously, I did not find this book to be compelling. I read two other books simultaneously with this one as it just could not hold my attention. The most interesting story was that regarding Lucile and the German officer who lived in her home. However, through no fault of the writer's, the intrigue ended abruptly. The historical aspects of that time in history were informative and absorbing. It is a tragedy that such a young and gifted writer's life was extinquished at Auschwitz for no reason other than her Jewish heritage."
5,The Most Talked About Book of the Summer!,"""The most talked about book of the summer of 2007. Suite Francaise is a must read for bookclubs everywhere."""
4,Humanity lasts,"It's not about war, but about truth and life in every human being regardless enemy or victim."
5,Suite Francaise,"This is a wonderful nook telling us what it was like to live under Nazi occupation. What a tragedy to have lost such a sensitive writer. It is miraculous that her daughter opened, read and uncerstood the significance of what her Mother had left behinf and then shared it with the world!"
2,"Novel has interesting aspects, but overall boring and difficult to get through.","While I found the descriptions of people being forced to evacuate their everyday city lives in Paris and others having to board German occupying officers extremely interesting, I found the other aspects of the story quite boring. I ended up skimming large portions of the last few chapters, which like much of the novel, are heavy on describing the situation but light on anything actually happening.The letters in the appendix from the author's husband are heartbreaking."
3,This is a great page turner for the first 50 pages,"I was feeling such compassion for these people as they left Paris. Then a bomb dropped. At page 50 the next page is page 19. Then the same pages 19 through 50 run again. And what comes after the second page 50? Page 83!. Woe is me! This is a library book, so now I will have to order it so I can finish it!"
1,Not a book for my Library,"Despite the quality of the writing, I found the character description so dispassionate that it was all I could muster to finish the book and even at that, it took me many weeks. I can't believe the majority of the reviews were so glowing but then perhaps I am being more objective to the work itself and not letting what happened to the author overshadow the literary value. If you enjoy WWII History, this book might be fun to read but if you want a good story with characters you can fall in love with, forget it!!!"
3,Couldn't get into this one,"I picked this book up because, well, it was recommended to me. I don't normally read books about or set during World War II, and this book is the reason why I don't read them. The subject matter is just way too depressing, and books about the war all seem to have the same theme. Sure, Nemirovsky is a wonderful writer, but this book has no plot! Its just a series of vignettes about people on the road fleeing Paris and the oncoming of the Germans. The characters are jumbled and confusing, and I really couldn't sympathize with any of them. Of course, the book was intended to be a 1000-page opus, but I just couldn't get into it."
1,mechanical,This is the book you think you should like. Dont worry it is banal and mechanical. I am virtually sure that the writer was more interesting than her book. Waste of time.
5,A MUST READ!,"""Suite Francaise"" is gripping, compelling - and beautiful literature. Wouk's ""War and Remembrance"" was a page-turner, but this book is that, and more. And the diary-appendix at the end will break your heart."
4,Point - Counterpoint,"I was immediately captivated by Suite Francaise. Nemirovsky was masterful at keeping her own feelings and circumstances in the distance, while letting the characters take on their own voices. Her ability to contrast the simple beauty of a summer day with the violence of war was magnificent. So also was her view of the struggle between the good for the individual verses the collective whole. In my opinion, her observation that France is a rapidly declining political force whose citizens nevertheless futilely attempt to maintain their snobbiness is the reason that the book does not get too heavy with sadness. Periodically it made me laugh!Although I completely agree with the editors in their decision to not overly edit Nemirovsky's words, it also makes the novel not as literarily correct and readable as it could have been if her situation had not been so horrific.The novel left me longing for more and I am deeply saddened that she never got to complete the series."
3,Slow,"Suite Fancaise is a bit tedious. There are many vignettes that are expected to collide but don't. It does, however, paint a picture of France during World War II."
5,Wonderful human story--if only she were able to finish!,"""Suite Francaise"" provides a wonderful human view on the chaos of World War II, a perspective of the conflict that is not often captured. It is a wonderful read, but the author's tragic end leaves you wishing for more once you reach it's end. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a fresh story of the Second World War."
4,"Lovely, heartbreaking","I couldn't wait to read this book after reading a review for it and I wasn't disappointed. Her writing is lush with beautiful descriptions and the people are so real and it's just amazing to think that she wrote this during the time that it was happening. I loved the appendices probably as much as the book, the letters especially were heartbreaking and the forward to the French version with a biography of the author was absolutely gripping."
2,"Disappointing read, wonderful appendices","I found this book difficult to get through. The first part (of what was to be a 5-part book) is choppy with superficial character treatments. What makes the work remarkable is the harrowing circumstances in which the author was writing. It's deeply tragic that this wonderful writer suffered and was murdered during WWII. The writing and storyline vastly improve in the 2nd book, and I believe if Nemirovsky had been able to revise and complete the novel, it would have been wonderful. As it stands, the book is rough and hard to digest. I do recommend this edition, however, because of the moving letters in the appendices written by Nemirovsky and her comtemporaries during the period leading up to and following her deportation. Those (not the fiction!) brought me to tears."
4,A Worthwhile Read,"This is a most thought-provoking book. How many of us know how we would have acted under the same harrowing circumstances? It's worth thinking about as a window into our own consciences. The author's descriptions of the characters are so well-done, and while one may tend to judge too harshly some of their actions, compassion for their plights should be the over-riding emotion."
4,Amazing Discovery,"I'm in a Book Club for retired teachers so our monthy selections are on varied topics to say the least. We had just finished reading a book about World security. I was speaking to my daughter, who is a professor in Scotland, about our newest book when she asked me if I had read ""Suite Francaise"". This fasinated me after she gave me some of the author's background.This book was written during the war while the author was living in France. The characters are ficticious ,representing different classes at the time . She decribes how it was living in France during that time when the government did not tell the people what was going on until it was too late and they tried to run for their lives.She invites us into each character's life and follows at least 3 whose families come from different stations in life. How she wrote this book, discribed these peoples reactions from all over France when she wasn't even in many parts of France is amazing. Reading her Bio first is a must ."
5,Powerful,"This book is an amazing account of events happening at the exact time it was written. I only wish Irene Nemirovsky would have lived to finish the manuscript, although each of the two novellas can stand alone, there was so much more to be said.I couldn't put it down."
3,"Good, not great","Frankly, I'm surprised at the comparisons with Tolstoy, et al. I think this is a very good book and it is not a masterpiece. Perhaps if the author had had the opportunity to finish writing, and particularly editing, this work, it may have merited more stars. As it is, it is a good book about the experience of individuals at the beginning of the French occupation, nothing more."
5,Enjoyable and Interesting,A really enjoyable read and extremely interesting. It was such a good book! Highly recommend. The ending leaves you trailing though...
3,Interesting World War II Stories,"There appears to be a number of books coming out that deal with WWII now, and this book is ""hot"" for the moment. It was recently issued, although it was written in French in the 40's by an author who perished at Auschwitz. Her family found her dairies, presumably edited them, and published a book from them. It concerns three different sets of people in in France in the early 1940's, at the beginning of the German occupation. The translation is considered to be excellent. There are more of her dairies available, so I'm sure we will be seeing more by this author."
2,Lousy!,"The most interesting thing about this book is the circumstances under which it was written. The prose is good but not great. The character development leaves a lot to be desired. I couldn't remember who characters were when they appeared in later chapters and didn't care what happened to any of them. I rarely leave a book unfinished, but after reading the first novella and starting the second one I realized it was more of the same and tossed it into the ""try to sell at used book store"" pile."
2,sucked,"It's not often that I choose to not finish a book, and even more rare that I throw a book across the room in anger, but I found this book to be uninteresting and confusing. With so many names and places, I couldn't remember who the characters were, or what they were supposed to be doing. I love world war 2 history, but this book sucked."
2,YUCK,"Sorry, but I can't believe anyone enjoyed this book. It was our book club pick for the month and halfway through I sent out an email asking for ANYONE to give me some hope to continue. No one could do it. It was difficult to keep track of the characters, and I didn't ""care"" about any of them, they just weren't developed enough."
3,Suite Francaise,"The book was interesting, but a bit confusing with so many charachters to keep track of. I thought the appendices were more interesting than the story."
1,BORING!,I posted a comment to someone elses 1 star review then thought I should create my own review so that the star rating might change and save others some valuable reading time.I'm sorry to say I found this book incredibly boring. Too many undeveloped characters with some meeting very brutal and outrageous deaths.
1,"Boring, Too Painful to complete",I had to force myself to get through even the first CD. I have listened to hundreds of books on CD during my daily commute to NYC and this was one of the very few CD's that was so painfully boring that I couldn't finish it.
3,"Okay, subject matter is interesting","Things I did not know about the German Occupation of France. Quite disturbing. The story was fiction but the indexes were fact which made the subject matter even more disturging.Dorothy Harper, Northridge, CA"
4,Enjoyable,This is such a great read. It transforms your day and you can feel the author's emotions!I wish there were more stories from her diaries!
2,Painfully slow.,"I'm not quite sure what the hoopla is about with this book. I dragged myself through to the end, just so I could say I finished it, but it was a chore. I do commend the author for her ability to help the reader transcend the mood of the war and what it must have been like for people fleeing the city during chaos and uncertainty. Other than that, I really felt like this book was disjointed and aimless."
1,Huge disappointment!,"I ""saved"" this book for several weeks after I bought it because I knew it would be a really special, wonderful read. Instead it is flat, condescending, and tedious. The plot jumps around to many characters, none of whom I like or care about. Most of the time the point of view is some distant, almost panoramic, omniscient point of view. I like novels with an up-close-and-personal, tight point of view. But in this novel the point of view just doesn't stick with one character long enough to establish any sort of reader empathy for any of them. It's not chilling, it's empty. Which reminds me that this manuscript was discovered unfinished, and truly was not ready for a reader's eyes. It reads just like what it is....an author's notes for a novel, not the novel itself.I stopped reading around page 100, which always makes me feel like a failure, and so I rarely do so. But still, if a book doesn't capture my attention by then, I am too old to waste more time on it."
3,"""Based on true history...""","The history behind the author of the book is what appealed to me, but the story lines kept me entertained to the end. Some parts dragged, but for the most part, the characters were very relateable and it is interesting to see how their lives intertwined in fictional WWII France. The fictional occupation and end to the war in France portrayed by the author in some ways leaves you hanging but also conveys what the uncertainties and tragedy of war can be like."
3,Beautifully written ......... but boring.,"This book essentially contains two novellas, the first involves the evacuation of Paris in the face of WWII German invasion. The second tells the story of the German occupation of a small French village.I enjoyed the first half of the first novella. However, midway through the first story and throughout the second, despite beautiful prose and outstanding writing, I found myself frequently bored. There are long stretches where virtually nothing happens.Perhaps I am a literary philistine, but the most beautiful writing in the world cannot mask a boring story, or one which moves at a glacial pace. There is certainly rich material here for more than the author accomplished. Beautiful writing and a captivating story are not mutually exclusive. It is possible to have both and, in my opinion, the author fails in the latter."
3,Good but not great,"So many people told me to read this novel; perhaps I was expecting something truly impressive. It's good and well written but very slow moving - I did find the prologue quite interesting as it shares the author's thinking about the remainder of the book through her notes. Part of the problem, of course, is that this is really an unfinished novel, edited by a friend of the author (who died in the concentration camps) - so, there is no resolution to many events and no future for many characters as there were huge parts of the book left to complete. The reader is thus left hanging in many instances. Good as far as it goes.....I wouldn't run out to buy it."
2,couldn't get into it,"This wasn't a book that captivated me. a lot of charaters, and none of them I really cared about. I usually never put down a book, but half way through this, I didn't have the desire to pick it up again. I didn't hate it - i just didn't find it interesting enough to continue."
5,Distraught that I'll never know the ending...,"I started reading Suite Francaise, knowing full well that it was an incomplete novel. However, I never expected to feel so strongly about wanting to know what happens to these characters. Part sad, part angry, I know that I will never know the ending. You have to give this novel time, it does not quite grab you right from the start. But the more you read, the more you want to know what is on the next page. A highly suggested novel: as one that lingers in your mind well after it's finished, and one that you create your own endings for the characters you've grown so close too."
3,Not Up to the Hype,"I really wanted to like this book. I read it after reading Vasily Grossman's LIFE AND FATE, a masterpiece of WW2 literature if there ever was one. And maybe it was the juxtaposition of that book with this that caused my disappointment. Where Grossman's book at 800 pages is taut and serious throughout, Nemirovsky's seems trivial by comparision. Had it been published soon after it was written, it would have been considered an interesting popular novel containing interesting observations of occupied France but ultimately lightweight in its' often pedestrian storyline and execution. It often reads like a mass paperback romance set within the larger context of the war, and too often devolves into hackneyed popular novel tropes - the cowardess and duplicities of the moneyed classes set against the native nobility of the poor, love amidst the ruins of war etc.Interesting light reading, but a ""classic?"" Sorry."
4,wonderful historical fiction,This is the first time I have read Irene Nemirovsky and find her writing style enjoyable. The story behind the novel and getting it published is just as fascinating as the novel.Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend.
4,impressive,"First, I want to say that reviewer Joan David's point about Nemirovsky's failure to address specifically the French Jews'especially perilous situation during the Nazi'sFrench occupation is an excellent, really tremendous point. She is utterly right to note how bewildering an omission that is, especially given Nemirovsky's Jewish status. As for the book itself, it makes for slow--dare I say at times, even tedious--reading, and yet it's undeniably absorbing, and often captivating. The writing is consistently rich and gorgeous. I liked Dolce quite a bit more than Exodus; the character development is much more satisfying; the characters' conflicts and predicaments are more intimately, compellingly felt. Superimposed on the reading experience, of course, is the knowledge of this gifted, brilliant artist's murder by the Nazis, an awareness that boggles and haunts all through the reading."
4,phenomenal reading experience.,"To read what is now historical fiction, but was contemporary fiction when written, is wonderful. She will move you emotionally. The appendices are a must read."
5,Superior Suite,"An compelling and captivating study of the French in time of occupation, and of the German individual soldier."
4,Pre-world war II days in France,"Graphic description of fleeing Paris before the Nazi occupation. Then, the capture of those of Jewish heritage end up in concentration camps. Informative, yet gloomy."
5,Suite Francaise,I found Suite Francaise to be an extremely interesting book. It is well written with great sensitivity. I strongly recommend it.
4,interesting read,well-written and involving account and story of the german invasion of Paris and of the countryside and the impact on everyone's lives.
3,an unusual but captivating story,Irene Nemirovsky never finished this book. It was published by one of her daughters many years after she died in a concentration camp. I found the first section of this book difficult to follow and hard to get into but there was still something that compelled me to keep going. The families were strange and unusual but their responses to the German invasion of Paris were funny and heart wrenching and I wanted to see what would happen to them. The second part of the book was much easier to read and much more fun. I was so sad when the book ended because I wanted to know where these characters lives would go and how Nemoirovsky saw their future. The notes about her plan for the end of the book and what is know about the end of her real life are included in the appendix and make this book unusual and more interesting.
2,Like slogging through mud...,"I'm a pretty optimistic reader. I keep reading long after common sense would dictate that I cut my losses and move on. I have this hope that somehow, magically, the story will pick up, the characters will become interesting and my time will be justified. Not so in this case. I actually gave up after a few hundred pages of disconnected stage-setting. I found no characters in whom I was at all invested and no inducement to continue reading. All the hype on this ""masterpiece"" left me feeling either cheated or far less intelligent that I had supposed. Reading ""Suite Francais"" was like slogging through mud. Uphill."
2,Overrated and uneventful,"I had read plenty of reviews on this book prior to reading it and I was very excited to jump into it. I was totally disappointed as I made my way further through the book. There is nothing ""classic"" or life changing about these 2 stories. In fact, I felt that the story telling was very dry and slow. I have read many books about the war and unlike many of the others, this one completely failed at grabbing my attention.In the end, this book was simply a very boring read. It wasn't horrible... but it definitely wasn't good enough to recommend to a friend."
2,suite francaise,Unbelievable characters with unbelievable dialogues.Not one of them has an individual voice.They all spout the same words in the same way.There have been far superior books written about and during this era.
3,Disappointed,"I read the reviews, and I must say that having read the novel, I was disappointed. The writing nerver flowed. I was always aware that I was reading a translated work. The narrative line was flat. Perhaps the narrative would have built toward something in the last three unwritten parts, had Nemirovsky written them. I didn't like the characters either, who all seemed a venal, self-absorbed lot.If the complexity of moral choices that this time in history foisted on ordinary individuals interests you, I would recommend Sartre's The Roads to Freedom, which I think is one of the finest novels ever written."
2,Don't bother,"We chose this book for our book club based on the fact that it was supposedly the best-reviewed novel of the year. All I can guess is that book critics were enthralled with the circumstances under which it was written. Indeed, those were fascinating and tragic. So while I feel a great deal of empathy for Irene Nemirovsky and her family, I didn't feel any empathy for any of the characters in this boring novel. I read A LOT and this ranks as one of the worst reads in recent memory. Perhaps if she'd lived to rewrite or edit it, it might have stood a chance, but as it is....don't bother, unless you are a student of French history or a WWII buff. Oh and by the way -- almost everyone in my book club felt the exact same way."
1,Thought I'd Love It... Couldn't Finish It,"I recommended this book to my book club after reading about the author and her story (as well as the book's fabulous reviews). Only two of us finished it (and not because they liked it - they wanted to honor the author). Maybe it's the translation, but I'm very sorry to say I found the writing and the characters absolutely horrid. Please note: I stopped at page 70. Maybe it got better from there, but I just couldn't take it anymore."
1,wish i could've read it...,"but after putting this on my wish list and finally receiving it, realized it was in FRENCH. i can't read French. I don't know how/what happened but I thought this was an English version. Can anyone confirm that this book is only in French? at a complete loss..."
3,lost interest,I found the book characters to be silly and boorish. I really wonder how true some of these charaters are or are they just a figment of her imagination. was disappointed.
3,okay,I couldn't really connect with the characters. They all seemed very self centered and I had a hard time caring about them.
5,An epic tale,This wonderful book has been well-reviewed on Amazon and elsewhere and I can only echo others' admiration for the beautiful writing and Tolstoyian flow of Nemirovsky's story. What a tragedy that she didn't live to finish the novel and continue to write much more. I especially appreciated the insights into life and survival in an occupied country and the human strengths and weaknesses that are magnified by that kind of perilous living. This is a must read for anyone who loves serious fiction.
5,Great Socks,"These socks are great for wearing for basketball. They provide excellent cushion and do a good job managing moisture. The socks don't ride too far up your leg, so they look ok as well. These are a great deal as compared to the Nike Elite socks, which cost an arm and a leg. I would recommend them. They are true to your shoe size. One note, make sure you wash them inside out (as noted in the instructions)!"
1,Comfy but...,These socks have a lot of cushion and is very comfy. The only major downfall i have with these sock is that they don't stay in place. I feel the sock move from side to side when im playing. They move so much that after i take off my shoes after playing basketball it looks like i wore them sideways. It actually caused me to injure my achilles heal. Luckily it wasn't too serious. I would return these socks if i could but it's too late.
4,always love Thorlo,"I bought these socks because the basketball type has a lot of Achilles tendon padding, which I sometimes need. They seem good in this regard."
3,Not a good walking sock,"I don't play basketball, I just wanted a nice thick sock to wear with my fairly wide walking shoes. These socks are so heavily padded that my toes complain when I wear them. The manufacturer suggests wearing them with shoes 1/2 size larger than normal. I'd rather buy socks that fit my shoes then the other way around."
1,Corrupted my TCP/IP stack,"After I installed this program on my Windows 2000 system, I was not able to access any internet sites at all. Later on I found out that the program somehow corrupted my TCPIP stack. I had to consult my IT expert to get this fixed. Users beware."
1,Absolutely Terrible Product,"This is the worst experience I have ever had with software. I spent an entire day trying to get this to work properly. I changed the settings around according to the maual and all I ever got was a ban on every single internet site. It would not allow viewing of anything no matter what I did. Also, my computer has not worked right since installing this program, it keeps have ""serious errors"" now. THIS IS A TERRIBLE PROGRAM AND A WASTE OF MONEY."
1,Doesn't Work,"I bought this product because my 6 year old grandson lives with me. Ever since we went with a cable connection, I get unwanted pornography even when I am not surfing the web. There is a family friendly site I use very frequently that does not have so much as a swear word on it. The program blocks that site routinely. I have entered the URL and hit override as suggested, and it does not work. Temporarily disabling the software is cumbersome - and unclear. It also will not let you view large portions of the home page for MSN, even on minimum security settings. It blocks hotmail completely. It was a waste of money. I now have to look for something else."
4,Good but short,"Full of very energetic, interesting, distinctive-sounding indie rock music; the songs are pretty standard with regards to arrangement, but are so full of vitality that any shortcomings are pretty minor. Standouts are ""This Sentence..."" and ""7th Son,"" but all tracks are good. It's an EP, and thus I should probably grade on an EP-normed scale, but I'm giving it 4/5 stars both because it's short and because it's not exactly revolutionary listening. Still, one of the more fun albums I've picked up in a while, and definitely worth the purchase."
2,Born Ruffians - Born Ruffians,"Born Ruffians are good enough for your typical indie rock band, with a catchy enough hook and mostly competent vocals. On their debut eponymous EP, they get to show off melodic hooks (""Piecing It Together"") as well as their Pixies influences (""This Sentence Will Ruin/Save Your Life""). They can simply be pleasant, too, with ""I'm One of Those Girls,"" even if the attempts at vocal gymnastics can seem a little strained. Still, this is only a short EP; it'll be interesting to see what they can do with a full album at their disposal."
5,perfect for beginners,"great DVD to learn all the necessary basics in learning to play guitar. A must for any beginner. DVD is great with different camera angles, great teacher, etc.."
1,"Not User-friendly, crashed my system.","I've been running computers since I built my own IMSAI 8080 in 1974, and have used a lot of software. I am currently running Windows XP on a 1.8 Ghz Pentium 4.This productr is typical of software and user manuals that are written by technicians, who have no appreciation for the concerns of day-to-day users.The setup is complex, consisting of multiple levels of registration and password protection. Once set up, it immediately blocked ALL of my incoming e-mail (I use Earthlink). Reading the manual proved useless.As far as I can tell, it conflicts with Norton SystemWorks, but who knows?..."
5,It Helped me,"I bought Meir's kit with the little book and bought this book. It contains beneficial Bates Method activities.I espicially like the movement exercises, postures which helped me correct many mis-aligned vertebrae in my neck, spine, hips and many vision problems caused by a dishonest Chiropractor throwing these vertebrae out of alignment. I ended up in the hospital. Then the Chiropractor tried to sell me 240 treatments and more for life; saying I will never be healed.Meirs method and physical therapy and a few movement, natural spine alignment methods helped to align the vertebrae and then my vision returned to normal."
2,Too bad there isn't a hard copy,"I wouldn't go so far as to say this is a farce, the man used to be blind for goodness sake! I think I would be more inclined to use it if it was in written form. Trying to find your way through the audio cassettes is difficult because you don't know what section he's talking about if you stop or roam the cassette. I kept wanting to skip certain parts but then got lost not knowing how far forward or back I should go. I just got discouraged. There is a decent length meditation/hypnosis type segment that didn't appeal to me, but maybe to others. He really stresses relaxing the eye instead of straining them on a daily basis which I think is such valuable information and really makes a difference. Just make sure you consider the advantages/disadvantages of an audio tape before you buy."
1,Farce,Where is the medical research that backs up this information? Someone is a few fries short of a Happy Meal!
1,Poor Quality,Softop Non-elastic SocksThese don't bind at all however they don't stay up either. I bought basically the same product on line from Dillard's and they were great. I'm not sure why Dillard's version stay up and these from Casual Male XL don't. I ordered several pair of black and blue. I believe I only received 2 pair of black. The others were back ordered. I cancelled the rest of the order. Dillard's no longer carries this type of sock so I'm looking again.
5,Great Man's Sock,"Soft top, meaning no stiff elastic bans in the top to hold the sock up. Nevertheless the sock stays up well while only gently hugging the leg. This feature aids in circulation and lessens edema of the foot and ankle. I will be buying more of these socks."
3,Cute,These shoes are cute and different since they're shiny but are uncomfortable- blisters the first few wears.
5,Wow!!!!!,"This is the first manga I've read. It's WONDERFUL! Once I got the hang of the way I was to read it, it was very fast-paced! I can't wait the next installment to come out! If you like gothic stories then this is a great manga to read!!"
4,still prefer the woodlands CD,"Hands down, Crystal Lewis is my favorite Christian artist. I love her music! I have nearly worn out my Live @ the Woodlands CD and was just as excited to get More:Live. As always, Crystal sings like nobody's business, but I have to confess I like my Woodlands CD more, because of the way she interacts with the crowd. On More: Live, it's hard to tell there's an audience at all! And, I Now Live is one of my absolute favorites and it's not on there. :( However, for a die hard fan like myself, this CD is still a must-have. The encore songs (both hymns, acappela) and When God's People Pray are my favorites."
2,WHY NOT IN WIDE SCREEN,"THIS IS A VERY GOOD MOVIE BASED ON A GREAT BOOK OF THE SAME TITLE,BUTWHY IS THIS DISC NOT IN 1:85:1 WIDESCREEN INSTEAD OF PAN AND SCAN??ALSO THERE IS A 182 MINUTE VERSION OF THIS FILM WHICH WAS RELEASEDON VHS TAPE - WHERE IS ALL THIS EXTRA FOOTAGE?? THIS DISC EARNS ONLY2 STARS - THE MOVIE REALLY DESERVES 4 STARS FOR QUALITY"
3,"So many stars, so little time..","It COULD have been an accurate and informative documentary-type film...it COULD have had an interesting, realistic script...it COULD have done with half the cameo stars and with lots more explanation of the true historic setting...but it wouldn't have become the made-for-tv film that it is. Everyone tries just a bit too hard in their roles, and the German stereotypes are actually very funny..the sneering accents, the Dachshund, the singing of ""party"" songs, the ""comraderie"" of the committed officers...Yah!Lots of money was spent on on this mediocrity, most of it, probably, going to the vast number of big names; just maybe it was PC in those days to sign on. It certainly couldn't have been to advance anyone's career..."
5,"great film,183mins does not compute?","If any body feels like buying this copy,do not,why?,well the movie in the uk version was only 158mins in the cinema,also the sub text in this site shows 172 mins,when put out on a usa video only 134mins,so do not wast your money buy the pal uk copy at 151mins it`s the best,oh and film is very good!."
4,Voyage of the Damned - film,"I just bought a copy of this film to donate to the local Holocaust library. The movie glosses over much of the atrocity of the event that is detailed in the book of the same name, especially the ""great silence"" by the United States. (I urge anyone interested in that aspect to read ""The Abandonment of the Jews"".) But the fact remains that many people will watch a movie, while they will not read the actual book. It is an historical event which every educated person should be aware of."
5,Great Workbook!,"My daughter, age 9, already knew a lot about Asperger's Syndrome, so introducing her to it wasn't an issue. She enjoys working in the workbook with me. Throughout the workbook, the child focuses on strengths and weaknesses, what the child can do and what they may need help with, etc. The child builds goals and plans for certain situations. We have not made it all the way through, some of the things are to make a homework schedule, etc., and we bought the book over the summer, so we are waiting for school to start before completing it. I really like that it helps me to be involved in her planning and tasks and gives us time to talk about things in a structured way, instead of her just venting about her problems. We are talking and working in a more productive way now, and hopefully as she works toward some of her goals she will see the benefits. My daughter is very high functioning, but I believe that it would be helpful to a wide range of children."
4,Supporting my niece's dream.,"This is the book that my niece needed for her class as she learns about being a pastry chef. Judging the the results and her grades, she is doing well."
4,"The Professional Pastry Chef: Fundamentals of baking and pastry, 4th Edition","A 'must have' for budding pastry chef's. Friberg is THE 'guru' of pastry. This volume is also great reference for anyone working in pastry, the pictures alone are inspirational as are all volumes published by this author."
4,plated deserts,There are great pictures of plated deserts. I used many of his ideas in class. There are even directions on how to do plate designs. I am still not so sure about some of the receipes.
4,Good information,It's a beautiful book with a great deal of information. I only wish it gave you information about the different flours and fats.
5,My Favorite Cook Book,"What a great book! I am a pastry chef and I use this book daily! I have found so many great ideas and learned so much from this book. Even for beginning bakers this book is easy to understand. I have used about 15 recipes from this book and I have about every other recipe marked to use one day.If you are looking for a book for making some serious dessert then this is a great book. I highly recomend it! It also has information on most of the desserts which I really like. It has where they come from, tips to help you with the dessert, and tells you about each ingrediant that you use and how it works."
5,Max Lucado's books are very positve for the yound mind.,This book teaches about being yourself and giving from your heart and appreciating people and life not trying to impress. It is a great story. I buy all Max's books for my kids. Being in Personal Development I connect with these and for my children and all children he is great!More of Max's books and other great Children's and teens books that are positive:
5,A great reminder.,The book is a sweet reminder that we are loved just the way we are! I would recommend it to young and old alike.
2,Lacking cultural diversity,"Although other reviews praised this book, I found it to be lacking in stimulating the senses of African American children and other cultures although the concept was great. As I began reading this book to my African American grandchildren, I didn't get past the 5th page before they were bored. They were not able to identify with any of the children displayed in this book, not even the children that were too busy to meet the king. I believe when we send an important message to our children through writing, that every child should be able to identify with that message. I am very sorry that I purchased this book for ($$) and if it is returnable, I will be sending it back. I definitely do not recommend this book for families looking to teach their children life's messages through cultural diversity."
5,Read this to your children,"I read this little story to my daughter tonight. She is 5. It prompter her to ask all kinds of questions that led to us having a great conversation about the meaning of this book. It also helped me put some things in perspective, too. I think we are better people because of it."
4,"Great guide, great game","If you like help, this is the book to buy. This game doesn't really require alot of help, except for the ""secret missions."" You may find some things you overlooked, or you may get the most out of the game by using the stratagies presented. Not a bad buy, Well written and detailed!"
5,KILLER SWEDISH GORE DEATH METAL,"I first heard this album about 10 years ago and was completely floored! The guitar riffs are truly outstanding. The riffage seems to rip and tear at your flesh like a razor sharp butcher knife. If you like Butchered at Birth from Cannibal Corpse you MUST get into Deranged. They pick up right where BAB left off. The vocals, drums are killer also. Just listen to ""Narcicistic Sleighride"" and if your skin doesnt peel off of your face, you're not human. Fans of Cannibal C., Exhumed, Carcass ect.. MUST get Rated X. This album is a classic Death/Grind release!"
2,CASS CREEK ELECTRONIC DEER GAME CALL,"TO THE NATURAL EAR, SOUNDS ARTIFICIAL OR AT BEST LIKE IT'S COMING OUT OF A CAN, AND IT'S NOT LOUD ENOUGH."
1,Product shown is NOT what you recieve.,"I ordered a Cass Creek Electronic Predator Call. (Coyote) I received a Deer call instead. I contacted Amazon about it. The web site says one thing but after ordering it shows up as another. Amazon claims the seller sets up the website on Amazon not them. I asked Amazon to contact seller and fix the situation. They did not. Shipping was too high to make it worth exchanging. I recently checked on the web site to see if it was corrected. It is still wrong. Stay away for this, I would highly recommend it to be a bad site."
4,From opener to expert,"In this book, I was really impressed because the item was very nice. From opener to expert, everybody who wants to know soil-structure interaction under dynamic condition may acquire his aim by this book."
4,A good sampler of the Stooges' brand of slapstick,"A PAIN IN THE PULLMAN has vaudevillians Moe, Larry, and Curly traveling by train. Of course, it isn't quite as simple as that, as the trip becomes a nightmare for all concerned. GENTS WITHOUT CENTS is notable for their famous rendition of the burlesque chestnut ""Slowly I Turned"" and for the dance specialties by Lindsay, Laverne, and Betty. TERMITES OF 1938 finds the Stooges as exterminators mistaken for professional escorts. If you know the Stooges, you'll know what to expect in these three shorts."
3,A Pain in the Pullman.,"A PAIN IN THE PULLMAN was kind of funny. Too many great gags. However, none of the short matches up to the fabulous ending. The conductor (Bud Jamison) throws the Stooges off the train and they fall off a cliff. Then they land on wild, bucking cows and head off, woop wooping. That is one of the funniest endings ever, if not the funniest. The ending was reused in A DUCKING THEY DID GO.GENTS WITHOUT CENTS was pretty boring, however. Not even the ""Slowly I turn"" routine can liven up the short. Too many dancing and acting sequences.TERMITES OF 1938 was a little funnier than the previous, but this dragged a little, too. Still, some funny scenes worth watching.A nice collection, worth buying."
5,Captured up in the nightmare,"This book was realisticly frightening as the author captured me up into this 'unrealistic' world of Hell. It is things that bad dreams are made of. Mr. Hinds descriptions are vivid and the tale spins and weaves, and entangled me into this horror story of death, life and those in between. The Hotel itself, contains different rooms where each dead sinner enters into to a new horror they have earned.If you like horror this is a definate book to read!Susie Harrison, published author of 'innocent insights' and 'Our Biggest Little Hero'."
3,Retread,"I already have most of the chapters in the book via articles published in Keyboard Magazine in the late 80's and 90's, so the majority of the info was redundant and just re-printed from those articles. There are some glaring omissions, such as leaving Roland out of the book except for a few pics!(?) Also, Korg received short shrift as well. I preferred Keyfax Omnibus Edition from Colbeck, although it had it's own errors as well. If you're a novice or didn't have access to those earlier Keyboard articles, this isn't a bad place to start."
4,Where is Roland?,"THis is a great book for lovers of synthesizers,drum machines, and the history behind synth inovators.The only downside is that it doesn't cover much on Roland and Korg. If it did I'd give it a 5 stars.Maybe an update is due in the secondhand section as when I first bought this book the prices were near enough, but since the Techno DIY ethic prices have skyrocketed.Well worth an investigation"
5,Great Book,This book has great recipes. I bought it because a friend had it. Two other friends also bought it. Book was in very good condition.
1,instructions,the recipes in the book look good and sound good. but good luck with the short preparation instructions. now i know how they fit all those recipes in there.
3,"Good CD Player, But Has Some Flaws","I recommend this cd player. One thing that irritates me is when I burn an MP3 cd, it ocassionaly comes up with the song ID and then doesn't play it. It then skips to the next song. Another thing that irritates me is when I place an MP3 disc into the cd player and close the lid, it takes forever to load the disc, and it makes a lot of noise while it's doing it."
3,Great Player but...,"I love this player, but the software makes it not live up to potential. CD text feature is great. Love the fm/am radio and also tv feature. The only hold back is the crappy software. The software will freeze your computer, cause many errors in burning. Look at Sony's message boards on thier site if you do not believe me. There is currently no support for the software. When emailing Sony about problems they just say check back on there website for updates, how does hat help? Buyer beware."
5,Dream came true,"This Cd player is the BEST CD PLAYER I have....first style looks cool....and sound quality is good. This could play Cd. mp3 and radio AM/FM...is like everything I need. The most important thing is this is ""Sony"""
5,Kellie's Review,This item is really cool...it's awesome because even if you are in the car and you're parents don't wanna hear the radio you can hear it yourself with out having to carry a mp3 player AND a cd player AND a walkman radio..so it's efficient easy and cool! i want it!!!
3,Just OK,These shoes are just ok. They look good on but they're kind of clunky and a bit heavy on the foot. They don't have the world's greatest tread so be careful on wet surfaces and breaking them in can be a chore. I have had mine for a good eight years now and I have only worn them half a dozen times. It is true they run a half size small. I bought my true size and they're a bit big on me. Maybe that's why I don't wear them as much as I would like. I highly suggest trying them on in a Fluevog store to make sure they fit right.
4,Clark Family Experience,Very good for some of their older stuff..Looking forward to the new one to come out!
1,Like a hord of horrific hillbillies peaking on speed!!,"Save your money and time. Here a group of individuals who are off key, play in a rushed frantic manner, and, simply put, just don't put it all together. Such a disappointment."
3,Humble beginnings.,"I was disappointed with this collection. You will not find the rich complex harmony and instrumental genius,that won them top honors on TV's The Next Great American Band. There is nothing special about the band on this CD, nothing wrong either,just a little country band. I cannot wait for a new release that will showcase the unique,mature talent that the Clarks have developed . They've come a long way, baby."
2,"Definitely not ""The Clark Brothers""","Having watched and rooted for the singing trio of ""The Clark Brothers"" on The Next Great American Band, I was hopeful that this CD would be a suitable substitute until their long-awaited album is finished and released. I couldn't have been more wrong. As with many acts that are thrust into the limelight by means of a hit single or a tv contest, this album is so overproduced as to make the sound virtually indistinguishable from any other country band out there. I am reminded of the debut albums of many of the winners of American Idol and what a disappointment they are for their overproduction. In this case, if you're looking for The Clark Brothers, keep waiting, because you won't find their excellent harmonies, amazing bluegrass licks and the simplicity of sheer talent here."
3,Bit too country for my taste compared to Next Great Band performances,"I was hopeful that this would be like their performances on the Next Great American Band even though there were more of the brothers on this CD. I was wrong; much too country for my taste, but pleasant enough I listened once and gave it away to a friend."
5,great listen,"Got this album (and the Sons of Sylvia album) together for my husband for Christmas. I never thought I'd enjoy a country/bluegrass-style album such as this, but was drawn to this group after seeing them on TV a couple of years ago. Well worth the money, and does a better job of capturing the essence of this talented bunch than their newer album"
5,Something More,"ok, i have been waiting since this series started for there to finally be something more between ed and gaia. they are becoming more than friends after a night of ed comforting her. YAY! heather is really starting to get on my good side. so, all i have to say is pick up this book and read it! it's one of her bests!"
4,A suspenseful addition to the Fearlesss series.,"Gaia is battling a terrible life, and she's aware that she's in danger -- but she has no idea who's trying to get her. Is it her father, or Oliver -- one of whom may be Loki? Her mother was murdered by him, and so was Mary. Gaia needs to think quickly to stay away from Loki's trap, wherever he is. Added to her life is Sam's betrayal -- while she doesn't know his fate, it seems that everything she has ever known has fallen apart even more. Can Gaia keep herself away from the ultimate enemy -- even while facing a bitter turn in her life? This book is a suspenseful addition to the series, but not as good as the pervious one. I can't wait for Fearless #19: Twins, because the suspense keeps building."
5,Another home-run for Ms. Pascal.,"The fearless series, in my opinion is one of the best out there. Ms. Pascal has found a way to keep her readers interested for 18 books now. The characters are incredible and the visuals she creates are unimaginable. The 18th book added to the outstanding series is just as good, if not better than the previous addtion. The plot becomes deeper once again as Ed confessed his love! And yet again another great cliffhanger, to keep the fearless readers on edge until the next book comes out. There is no point in trying to escape it. I only have 3 words, GET THIS BOOK. It is outstanding and geniously written."
5,Switches with several advantages,"I like these switches. They come with built in red and green lights, a button to push to make the track open or close manually, good size electronic control switch, and if the train goes in the opposite direction against the closed switch, the switch opens and doesn't derail the trains."
2,Could barely make it to the end,I thought the book started well. It kept my interest for a while but I found myself plodding through to get to the finish line. At some point it just got boring and though I did stick with it... I was disappointed in the ending.I thought the author was quite pretentious with his vocabulary. Why not just say what you mean instead of trying to use as many obscure outdated words? I found it tiring to read and would not recommend it.
4,Fun but No Payoff,"This novel is right up my alley. It is the story of young librarian, Alexander Short, caught up in a search for a timepiece to complete a collection owned by a wealthy eccentric, Henry James Jesson III. Books, library searches, heraldry, theft, adventure and a wife who is constantly trying to seduce her husband. Who could ask for more?And, indeed, this is a fun little book. I am particularly fond of the scenes set in the New York Public Library with its resources and its cast of interesting characters. I also find the search for the timepiece to be an interesting one with plenty of twists and turns along the way.My only complaint about this book is the payoff. There really isn't one. I found that the book just kind of fizzled out in the last few pages. I have not read Kurzweil's first novel, A Case of Curiosities. I wish I had. I get the impression it might throw some light on this novel. Still, as it is, it's a quick novel and well worth a read."
2,Too clever for its own good,"This is a cleverly conceived novel with some amusing moments but ultimately dissatisfying.A novel about trying to find a stolen treasure (Marie Antoinette's clock) - could be a good yarn but notice there are 60 chapters like the 60 minutes on the clock face and you'll start to see that this book is trying to be clever. The characters are unbelievable, the plot unbelievable; but it is clever and we can have a few chuckles at the anally retentive librarian protagonist's predicament - but that is all you get."
1,Pretentious,"Maybe we could form a group named LDBTGC--Librarians Disappointed (or Disgusted) By The Grand Complication. As a librarian for 25+ years I was, like many others, looking forward to reading this book. Halfway through the book I kept hearing the words ""precious"" and ""pretentious"" echoing in my skull. The librarians depicted in this book are stereotypically odd, crochety, obsessed, narrow-minded and antiquated. Hey--real-life librarians are lively, funny, hip and often sexy people. The core of this book--a snotty old fart's search for a missing antique pocket watch--was basically so uninteresting that no number of complications could redeem it."
3,"""Precious"" in the derogatory sense","This book was exasperating because it started so well and bogged down so quickly. As a former special collections librarian, I hooted with recognition at its accurate depictions of the bureaucratic absurdities, personal politics and turf wars of library life. Yet disenchantment soon set in. I love a cerebral thriller as much as anyone, but Kurzweil smothers us with intellectual minutia. His two principal characters are too fond of their own cleverness to be engaging. Watching them wallow in self-appreciation of their own wit becomes cloying -- the reader waits with dwindling patience for some movement in the plot. It's like being slowly pecked to death by Phi Beta Kappa sparrows."
2,"i did ""get it,"" but i still didn't like it.","several reviewers suggest that anyone who did not enjoy this book didn't ""get it."" this bit of snobbery is poppycock. i found kurzweil's A Case of Curiosities to be a delightful romp. it was written with profound love, and it managed to be erudite & arcane while remaining emotionally honest.i seldom leave a book unfinished, but i just couldn't take this one. it is a wan, uninspired, poorly executed attempt to recreate his debut effort.because i did so enjoy his first book, i sincerely hope kurzweil has another book in him, one that has the spirit and artistry of his first, not just the same stylistic shape."
2,Librarians only.,"One way to get a best seller is to have an attractive dust cover, which this book certainly has. Librarians may want to read it just to check out whether or not the author has done his homework. I'll guess they'll either be impressed or laughing.The first seven eighths of the book were good reading, if a bit esoteric. To finish up, Mr. Kurzweil spins up a fantastic (in the unbelievable sense) ending that whimpers a la the ending of ""The Da Vinci Code""."
5,"Quirky, silly, funny and...",each time you watch an episode you will hear something you missed the first time around. These guys are fun and remind me of those nutty relatives many of us have that argue and don't realize how hilarious they are.
2,The first one was way better,"The first set is one of the funniest DVDs I own-naturally, I was exited about the release of the second one. I was dissapointed to say the least. The only episode worth watching is"
1,mooninites hate ATHF,"I am a mooninite...I hate the aqua teen hunger force. they are stupid and stole the Foreigner belt. Carl is an interesting human...we have performed an **** probe on him several times and he keeps asking for more!Seriously, We are from the moon and want to moon the ATHF. We do like to watch the cartoons...for information on how to defeat the ATHF."
2,ripping us off,"Ok. First off I want to say that if I was to rate the quality of this show, I would give it 5 stars. Aqua Teen Hunger Force is easily one of my favorite cartoons right now. However, someone is really trying to screw us fans with this dvd. (...) That is just crazy. Why would they not put all 24 season 3 episodes in this set? The answer is they want to get as much money off these dvds as they can. The funny part is the need for a 2 disc set. Are they using single layered dvds? You could probably fit 13 episodes on one single layered disc and unless they are including 4 hours of commentary and special features they are really just deliberately ripping us off. I will probably end up buying this baby because I love this show too much and want to support them so they don't go the way of Home Movies, but it really disgusts me how they are selling this."
5,11 minutes of laghter!,"This is a great 11 minute show! it`s so funny! This is the best show on Adultswim besides Family Guy and Futurama, but those are origanaly on Fox so this is the best real Adultswim show and dvd out. Meatwad, Frylock, and Shake are hilariouse along with there neighbor Carl. The best episode in the set in my oponion is Super Bowl. Meatwad win`s a trip to the super bowl and can only bring one person of course he chooses his box friend Boxi, he dosn`t even go to the super bowl! He says he did but he didn`t. So buy this if your looking for 2 discs with 13 11 minute episodes buy this you wont be Dissopointed!"
5,Love it!,I own seasons one and two and I would preorder all the seasons if I could. I just wish that they could have kept in the original songs and maybe added some extra features like commentary from MJH or the other cast members.
5,"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, Second Season",I received this set with a multiple shipment. This video was damaged upon shipment; however I contacted Amazon and they gave me the shipping label and paid for the shipping for return. I received the replacement copy within three or four days with full satisfaction. I love Sabrina and will order the third season real soon!
3,Bad Transfer,The transfer is horrible.The first season was done pretty well although it did not have Subtitles.I was expecting the second season would be more better than first.It is LOUSY.The print is too sharp and again no subtitles.
2,Disappointed,"I saw this book on amazon.com thought it was a good deal, went to Barnes and Noble store to look at it and realized it looks stupid. There are too many pargraphs not enough examples. I figured an interactive book would be INTERACTIVE. The users book did not even come with a cd. I searched and searched for the interactive part of it.I bought ""Unix Made Easy: Second Edition"" instead. Many more examples and bigger typeface. If you arent into reading huge paragraphs to find the answer, dont bother with the Interactive books. They are all the same. Its a BIG BIG book, too much info, not enough examples."
5,Don't Miss This Fast Paced Thrill a Minute Horror Ride,"Immortals and dragons and vampires, Oh my! I whipped through this fast paced new novel by the immensely talented S.J. Gaither and Michael Canada in two days. I literally could not put it down. Thefirst tale of adventures of Poppy Z, a two thousand year old witch who's a magnet for danger. When Romo The Immortal appears unexpectedly at Antique Bookz, her metaphysical store, Poppy knows she's in for a ride. Romo and his reluctant sidekick Caffee are in trouble, having incurred the wrath of an ancient being with powers that rival their own. Halloween Jack and his minions make life a living hell for Poppy, the immortals and her beloved talking white cat Midnight, as time runs short for Romo. This is the introductory novel in the Witching Moon series. Filled with intriguing characters, sidesplitting banter, and plot twists that will keep you spellbound. Don't start this book at night if you plan on getting any sleep."
5,Excellent collection of Polish 80's pop.,"Excellent collection of Polish 80's pop by Urszula. Considering the setting & time--a country behind the Iron Curtain, under a military dictatorship since '81, US sanctions imposed--this is top notch music. Easily comparable to Kim Wilde or Pat Benetar with more synths thrown in."
1,Coarse Bruckner Te Deum,This contains the strikingly coarse Bruckner Te Deum produced by Zubin Mehta. Just unbelievable for workaday slapdash nonchalance. The presence of the great Judith Blegen is heartbreaking in this terrible effort.
2,Gaaaah,"I'm sure this is a very important book but it's so boring, that it's hard to concentrate from one sentence to the next. Honestly, please, when people write books, no matter how complex the topics, they should make at least an EFFORT to be interesting, to engage the reader. I'm not faulting the very thorough research and ideas, I'm faulting the author for not trying to make me care. How about a few illustrations or stories, or funny stories of when things went wrong in the field. ANYTHING!"
4,Provides a background for further study...,"Mahatma, Traitor, God, Machiavellian, Father of the NationYogesh Chadha has done a great job in trying to bring forth the man behind the legend. But Gandhi was and is a very complex personality.Throughout his life Gandhi's view matured and changed every day. This I am sure irked the British but it is the essence of Gandhis life that he absorbed the good out of every incident in his life.Many critics view Gandhi as a political leader but as is made evident by Chadha Gandhi was extremely religious and this was where he found the strength that made the sacrifice of millions logical to him. We should be thankful that his fanaticism was towards truth and peace and only forced on himself (quite unlike the leaders nowadays).A great book but a new reader would be advised to read Gandhi's Autobiography first as that is very approachable and lacks the dichotomy in this book that can leave a reader confused..."
1,Deceiving shot,"When I purchased these earrings, I was basing the size by what was shown as decent size topaz, but was so sadly disappointed when I got them. They would suit a little girl and I mean LITTLE girl. Do not buy this product."
4,iZ-chrome,I really enjoy making people laugh! They come to my office at work just to see what new and weird things I come up with. Everyone that has seen my iZ laughs and can't believe I have such a unique toy. :) Thanks! I'm enjoying the noise!
3,Garden of A-la-la,"Talk about Hollywood getting the inside treatment! The book is filled with 30s and 40s anecdotes from Sheilah Graham about the fabled Garden of Allah hotel. I loaned my first copy to Natalie Schafer who lived there and never got it back so I was glad to get another both reasonably priced and in good condition. When I first moved to Hollywood I lived on N. Crescent Hts. and was shocked to learn that the ugly bank building at the top of the street was the site of the hotel. At least there is a small plaque mentioning it. Loved the neighborhood, loved Schwab's and would have also greatly enjoyed stopping across the street to Nazimova's garden."
5,"a Gimplse into Old Hollywood,.......","Ms. Graham has really captured the feel and flow of the way things were in the Garden of Allah, especially during her times there, What is really great is the references of the Garden of Allah prior to the building of the Main Mansion, the custom china that may have been purchased as Ms Nazimova then begun major renovations, besides the pool shaped like the Caspian Sea, 2o some spanish/Moorish bungalow's within the 3 acre tropical paradise that was across the street from the Chateau Marmont, and across the street from, Schwabs, the Gardens were on the So,/We corner of Crescent Hieghts and Sunset, for more [...]"
4,comprises all major luxury watch brands,"This annual bible for watch experts is also a good starting point to look for a new exclusive and beautiful watch. All important models are pictured with very detailed information about the Movement, Functions, Case, Dial, Brand, Price and Variations of the wristwatch available. The guide comprises all major luxury watch brands such as Audemars Piguet, Baume & Mercier, Blancpain, Breguet, Breitling, Bulgari, Cartier, Chopard, Corum, Ebel, Eterna, Girard- Perregaux, Glashuette Original, Hublot, IWC, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Maurice Lacroix, Lange & Soehne, Franck Muller, Ulysse Nardin, Nomos, Omega, Oris, Officine Panerai, Patek Philippe, Piaget, Paul Picot, Porsche Design, Rado, Rolex, TAG Heuer, Tissot, Zenith and many more."
1,Sophomoric Drabble,"This is perhaps the worst book I have ever read in my life. It is full of sophomoric drabble the author presents as new and insightful information. The tired stories and advice are all retreads of information the average intelligent adult would have processed and learned from by middle high school. The author is either extremely immature to find such topics as refreshing and worthy of print or is stuck in a Peter Pan like existence unable to proceed into adulthood. Save your money and avoid this drabble, it is quite clear why it ranks so low on Amazon, it is an insult to present it for sale, I would like a refund."
1,"Lousy, effin lousy and contemptible","Lousy book, effin lousy waste of my money, fooled like a virgin out of my money, contemptible waste of a tree"
4,"Beautiful, slightly mundane","Schubert has written some of the most beautiful music of the Western world, yet has never attained the fame of a Chopin or Schumann or Rachmaninoff. This is mostly due to his in-between status...somewhere after Classican but not quite Romantic. His writing is refined and elegant down to the last note. These impromptus are the essense of the artist, his finest works (being small and self-containted) and they are given a good - but not perfect - rendering. Still, it is a wonderful album and well worth the money."
2,Like a machine,"Brendel's playing seems emotionally detached, as if he's just going through the motions of an actual performance. Edwin Fischer plays the Impromptus and Moments Musicaux with more warmth, Clifford Curzon with more refinement. Both are able to hold the listener's interest; Brendel - for the most part - does not."
4,UFO could rock even after Schenker,"I guess most of us agree that UFO without Michael Schenker is not the same, but when it comes to ""Making contact"" I can assure you that it's quality rock all the way from the opening ""Blinded by a lie"" to the closing ""Everybody knows"". I won't claim that this album is better than the classics from the 1970's but this time UFO sure come close to former heights. I strongly advise you to check out ""Making contact"" because it's much better than its reputation. With this one, you get melodic hard rock best served loud."
3,Not for those in Southwest US,"I was disappointed in this book. I was hoping to find information about growing succulents outside in Arizona. This plant is geared toward those in colder climates who want to grow plants in pots that can be moved in or out depending on the weather.Also, the information provided is very generalized toward succulents as a whole. If you are looking for specific information about a particular species, you won't find it here. Probably a good book for beginners who are looking for general information."
2,Poor,"I knew within 10 minutes of owning this clock that it would soon be on its way back. For starters, when you read this clock is compact, BELIEVE IT; it is roughly softball size. Next, the LCD display is fine if you're looking at it from above eye-level. At eye-level, the display is only about 25% visible at best and a foot or two below eye-level it completely disappears, so if you're giving this clock a home on a headboard, forget it. Finally, the buttons for shutting off the alarms are way too close to the snooze button (pictured, they are the ones just below and right and left of the snooze.) I wanted this clock for two reasons: extendable snooze and full battery back-up, which it has, but the reasons I now don't want it easily outweigh the latter."
2,Too small and too bright,"I like the fact that I can now set the alarm for 2 different times since I get up at different times during the week. However, the clock is actually too small. I thought it was going to be a little bit bigger. Also, the display is too bright. I wear glasses and squint at night to see the clock. It is harder to see than the old clock I had which was a black background with the time being displayed in yellow."
4,Small and atractive.,"The only complaint I have with this alarm clock is that it is a bit like operating a watch. It does not have enough buttons to allow for easy changing of the settings. On the other hand, once the device is set up the functions that you use most frequently are very assessable. I also enjoy the softness of the light. It is readable in the dark yet does not offend the sleepy eye."
3,It's fine I guess,"The biggest complaint I have about this clock is that you have to look at it straight on to see the digits in the dark. My bed is lower than the clock to I have to sit up to see what time it is. The radio alarm only last 30 mins (hey, it takes some people a little bit of time to crawl out of bed!). One thing I really like is if you unplug it it remembers the time for a few minutes even without a backup battery."
5,Essential Caregiver Guide to Alzheimer's,"I received this book as a gift from a long-time friend about a year after my Father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. This book made me laugh, cry and get angry, but most of all it became a companion during the long, hard care of my Father. Mrs. Shanks gives the patient and caregiver humanity. She includes tips for care and really lets the caregiver know what to expect in dealing with this terrible disease. Of all the books I have read dealing with Alzheimer's this is clearly the best!"
4,Great hangers,I like these hangers because they look like hangers from major department stores and they are of good quality and strong. I especially enjoy the cherry wood color of the hanger.
4,Great album,"I picked up this one simply by the fact that LaBrie did the vocal work. I'm not sure what I expected, but when I first listened to it my thoughts where ""ho-hum."" I think because LaBrie's distinct vocal talents were forefront I was expecting the Dream Theater sound. The more I listen (even now) the more I like this ablum. It is not as heavy as DT stuff...it is more sublime. LaBrie does some of his finest vocal work to date. Excellent musicianship all around that is sure to please almost all prog metal and Dream Theater fans."
3,Just ok,"Mullmuzzler's first album was a lot better than this one. And I'm not the kind of guy that gets upset when a band changes how they sound. I LOVE when bands try to break new ground. I believe that Dream Theater breaks new ground every time they step into the studio. However, that didn't translate over into this disc. There is a lot of cheese on this album. The tracks that are good are VERY good, but the tracks that are not sound like 80's hair band music. I would say that if you're really into Dream Theater and all their side projects, this is a worthwhile CD to buy, but only if you're willing to buy a CD that's only about half good."
2,Very poor.,"If you liked the first Mullmuzzler for the high energy tracks and complicated music, STAY AWAY from this one. This is a total LaBrie showcase. It's like the musicians were forced to play super boring super slow music so LaBrie could ""show off"". If you are a mellow listener, however... this is totally for you. But fans of Mullmuzzler: Keep it to yourself, should stay far away."
3,Good Baseball History,"The late Curt Flood was not some dumb jock. This book is part autobiography and part polemic. A great deal of what he writes about is now historical, yet it's interesting to see how things looked first hand then. Whenever today's highly paid athletes look in their wallet they should thank Curt Flood, all the more ironic as he died nearly penniless. A very interesting and entertaining read."
1,Another crap Alex product,"Got these along with the ""bath writers"" (see other review) and these were just as disappointing. Didn't even write on the wall with any moisture (you're in a frickin' tub, remember). Stay away from Alex products! Junk! Shameful to waste resources in this way if you ask me."
