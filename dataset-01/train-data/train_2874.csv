1,Did not help me at all.,"Some people were helped by this, I wish I was one of them. It actually made me hurt quite a bit worse. I sent it back."
4,One size does not fit all,I just put the Pro Tech Achilles Support on and I thought my ankle is almost too big for this. My ankle at the base is 11 inches around and I have less than an inch of velcro left with a sock on. I would say if your base of your ankle is bigger than 11 inches do not buy it......I will wait and see if this helps me or not....I just wish they came in different sizes....
3,Achilles support didn't work for me,"Unfortunately this support did not work for me. I wish the under-heal strap was longer and the ankle band was longer. It fit too tightly. I have a size 10 foot and am 5'10"" and the support rode too low on my heal putting more painful pressure on my achilles, instead of relieving the pain. It felt fine if I was sitting but my achilles would ache once I walked with it on. I believe the pressure was applied too low."
3,no review yet,"I haven't used it much. My injuries are beyond what this gadget can do. I expect it will be useful down the road, once I'm all healed, and I feel a twinge. The strap that goes under was a little long for me. I sewed it a little shorter. I wear a 9-1/2 wide shoe."
1,Velcro straps aren't strong enough,Title speaks for itself. The velcro on the straps wouldn't hold up after a few weeks of wear. So if you plan to wear this regularly for plantar fasciitis then plan on buying a lot of them if you experience what I did.
5,Good results,"Since I've begun using this product,I have been experiencing a lot less pain when jogging. I highly recommend this product."
1,Way too tight,"I should have listened to several other reviewers on this one. I am 5'6, 140lbs, and this barely fit around my ankle. The packaging claims it will fit someone as tall as 6'3, but I doubt it would fit anyone taller than 5 feet. Returned this item immediately"
4,good product,"It does what it is suppose to and helps support the tendon and reduce pain. It also works as a way to keep your foot in the correct position at night to heal more properly.The only negatives are that is is a little on the small side, but still OK for a 200# guy.It was a good value and helped with my tendonitis recovery."
2,Not good for those with swollen tendons,"I have swollen Achilles tendons and wearing these things creates nothing but pain and discomfort.This product might very well work to prevent swelling, by supporting to the tendon, but it certainly dosnt help if you have swelling."
4,A new spin on well-known songs,"Though always a pleasant surprise listening to new arrangements, those preview links are somehow mixed up. When you press ""Behind the wheel"" you got ""Higher love"" which is not included anywhere on this tribute album. Weird. If you're a DpM fan, you'll have no problem whatsoever in renaming them once in your computer. But, still strange. Love."
3,mediocre adaptation,"not the greatest interpretation of the story, illustrations are lovely though. Book was a used library copy which was unexpected."
1,Not what its title implies!,"This video is 50-plus minutes of step aerobics with a little bit of arms and abs thrown in. If you're looking for a fast and fun workout with a focus on toning arms and abs, don't bother with this video."
3,Its okay.,"Tamilee is great but I did not get the feel from the other two instructors. Its a good workout. Not the best. Its a little confusing with the cardio/step then muscle toning then cardio then muscle. You have to workout, stop pick up weights and back and forth. I do not have strong feelings about this one but I have only tried it once so far."
1,Don't Bother,"I went through 15 minutes of this exercise and just turned it off. The intructors work at such a pace that you end up just standing there wondering what they are talking about. It is just choppy and doesn't flow very well. Perhaps if I were a step-aerobic master I would appreciate it more, but probably not. There are many beter work outs than this one. I recommend those."
4,Good video - depends on the fitness level,"I tend to disagree with the other reviews. I had this video and was sorry I got rid of it. This video would be great for my current situation. Arthritis in my ankle and haven't worked out in too many years. It's a more controlled pace, with easier moves than some videos/DVDs I have used. I will agree with the toning portion - it's mediocre at best, but the aerobic is a good steady pace for beginners, and I think once you have mastered this video, you would be able to move on to other more complex, challenging DVDs."
1,Rich kid that wants to be a rap star,Don't be fooled by his lyrics and looks. This punk has multi-millionaire daddy who is paying for everything. He has all the money in the world but wants to look like he is a thug. He is a chump and his raps suck. It is too bad that the beats his daddy is paying for are being wasted. He is having a serious identity crisis and is wasting his daddy's hard earned money in order to look like a baller/gangster/hustler. He is none of those things. This punk should have watched Malibu's Most Wanted and taken a hint.
2,Wyeth Barclay is an okay rapper,"Did you know that he is really good at the gentlemen's game, Golf? His beats are fat like his rich dad's wallet. holla back!"
5,SEATTLE IS FILLED WITH HATERS,The 206 is HATER-NATION out here. Man people will hate u for N-E-THING. Dub B is tight-and he is just doing what he loves 2 do-slangin' rhymez. All these haters should spend more time doin' real ______ and spend less time hatin'.
4,Good mattress...wrong batteries,"The mattress is comfortable, the pump is great. Only issue is the description says four D-Cells. Got to the campsite and realized it took six C-Cells. Wasn't too happy about that. After the hour and a half round trip to get more batteries, everything was just fine."
5,The Best!,"This mattress is so good, 3 other family members have since bought them too. Great quality, comfortable, and holds air for days."
4,Great Gloves,"I first saw a friend using an `Ove' Glove during Christmas. I was fascinated to see that such a thing existed. They are great. I like the flexibility they give to the 4 fingers, unlike oven mittens that feel so clumsy. It is also machine washable. I recommend buy two for handling big trays."
2,No Onscreen Lyrics,"I was extremely disappointed with this KARAOKE CD. Karaoke CDs are supposed to have onscreen lyrics so that people who don't know all the words can sing along with the cd. The background music is all beautiful, but without the onscreen lyrics, I don't use this cd at all when I'm at the karaoke places."
2,Disappointed,"Thought that with the name saying Karaoke it would actually be a karaoke cd with the lyrics showing up on the monitor for my kids to use to sing, but it doesn't. Would classify this as a sing along disc instead. Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews of this or volume 1&2 so I have 3 disney ""karaoke"" cds with out lyrics on the monitor and not even the originally performed songs from the movies."
1,Lies! Lies! Lies!,"IF you are looking to buy a KARAOKE CD, don't be fooled by the label! This is NOT a real karaoke CD. A real karaoke CD contains files that provide both music and lyrics on-screen. This CD contains two tracks of each song, one with background singers, one without. The lyrics are provided in a booklet format.While we waited for this CD to arrive, our children's expectations were very high. Their disappointment was too sad. Disney should be ashamed of themselves for marketing this as anything more than an audio CD."
2,not what I wanted,"It was not a karaoke cd. It was an instrumental cd. No words displayed on the screen. What karaoke party do you see people reading from alittle cd cover, and not a tv screen? I was very disappointed........"
1,Didn't work w/ our karaoke machine :(,The words don't show up on the screen for us. All of our other CD's seem to work so I'm not sure what the problem is :(
1,Shame on Me!!!,Didn't read the reviews. Shame on me. Shame on Disney. This is nothing more than a CD - there are many fine Disney CD's to pick from. Stock must be really hurting that they have to bite the hand that feeds them.
1,Not a karaoke CD,"Other reviewers already said it, but here it is again - this is NOT a karaoke CD. It is a sing-along CD."
4,Cellular Antenna,"The antenna works great. I bought it for my USB Internet Access card. The aircard barely has a useable signal inside the house with only it's built in antenna. The antenna has a ten foot cable which lets it sit at the corner of the front porch. I have a steady 3 or 4 bar signal most of the time with the antenna.The only complaint is that nearly every cellular device; aircards and phones, need a unique adapter cable to work with the antenna. This is not the fault of the antenna maker or seller. It is due to a lack of standardization in the cellular industry. This vendor does sell most of the adapter cables for [...] but their info does not make it obvious that you need one or easy to figure out which one.There is an exhaustive list of the adapters, searchable by device manufacturer and model numbers at the antenna makers site at [...]Good Luck"
4,ist rate,"All Wilson products were excellent but not user friendly. Directions included did not explain products and their use properly. For example, the green light ""lit"" is not mandatory to use the amplifier. Also, as long as the ""no phone service "" icon is not illuminated on the phone, the amplifier will function. Again, the instructions are incomplete, especially concerning building installations. Please pass on to factory. I almost returned everything out of frustration but stuck with it. I had the antennae taped to a broom stick!!You probably have abnormally high rate of returns due to the above."
3,Requires a unique Wilson adapter!,This antenna cannot connect with the Wilson Cell Phone Signal Cradel Booster without a special adapter from Wilson. I have ordered the SMA-Male Connector 971119 and hopefully it will work.
2,adaptor,did not have the adaptor for the handset in box so could not use extended antenna while on vacation in remote areas.
1,magnet mount antenna 301103,did not have female connetor so i could notinstall it with out buying more partsi think connetor shoud have been incluled
3,"Okay, if it worked","Product would be okay I guess if the Wilson Sleek signal booster worked. iPhone was not helped on AT&T ""E"" service in very rural location."
1,Wrong product for the Wilson Booster,"Amazon continues to ship this antenna with the Wilson Electronics Sleek Booster, and it is not the right antenna. Wilson has told them many times they are shipping the wrong antenna but they continue to do it. This was very frustrating and caused me a lot of grief as I was not able to get on the Internet for a week due to Amazon's problem. I am returning the whole package to Amazon even though Wilson Electronics was able to send me an adapter in the next week or so, but the primary reason I purchased this product was to use over the Holidays where the place we were staying had little reception. Not being able to use my smartphone hot spot really made me angry. There is not excuse for this as Amazon has been told many times by Wilson Electronics that they are sending customers the wrong product."
2,Not good for in home use,"I have a samsung phone with tracfone as my server, in my home we have zero bars, no service We purchased the wilson sleek with the better antenna in the hope of get at least 1 bar with service. No such luck. Works great in the car, not in our home"
1,WTF?,"Packaging was correct, item was not. Wanted a replacement for broken antennae. Sent me a bag full of broken headsets? or something. Really?"
3,Not working for us.,"I'm sure this is a great antenna, but it's not working where my husband is working in South Texas. We hoped it would help him get a better signal, not happening. The area that he is working in is called the ""Dead Zone"" by all this co-workers. This may work for you, but not for us."
4,Great.. BUT you need the adapter,"I ordered this one for my truck. I live in a very rural area and bought this for use with the Wilson Sleek. I didn't realize, and they didn't say that you need an adapter for it to work with that device. There is another package out there for a couple dollars more that has the adapter included. Buy that one if you are using the Wilson Sleek or other Wilson Cradle device. On the plus side the Sleek came with much smaller antenna and I am already getting a much better signal. With the right adapter this antenna is going to really help keep me connected. I went ahead and bought the adapter and a second antenna (with adapter) for my RV, making the Sleek usable in the RV or the truck"
3,Good antenna but the mini is better,"This antenna works well but the mini is better. The main complaint is the wind whistels through the coil, so it must be set way back on the roof. No sound from the mini dual band version and just as good reception.Update 5-28-10: Actually, the mini has much better reception"
3,Amazon Wrongly Recommends this For Wilson Sleek,"While ordering a Wilson Sleek Cell Phone booster on Amazon, I added this antenna from the ""Frequently Bought Together"" recommendation. The two items are not compatible. The antenna has the wrong connector. The correct antenna shown in the Wilson Sleek literature is # 301125. I have no problem with the quality of the antenna, I just want to warn others of the misleading information on Amazon."
1,Doesn't work,"My phone had zero bars, this did not improve it at all. I tried it on my brother's phone who has two bars in the rural area I live it did nothing for his phone. Not even one bar increase. I used it with the wilson univeral adapter. I am considering buying another adapter but I don't want to waste any more money."
5,but you need an adapter...,"I bought this antenna because Amazon bundled it with the Sleek Booster. Only when I tried to connect them did I find that they can't connect unless you have a barrel adapter. I called the Wilson company and they're sending me one free.I wish Amazon would let it's customers know about needing the adapter...Otherwise, I'm very happy with the purchase.Right now I'm using the small antenna that came with the Sleek Booster. I've gone from 1 bar to 5 bars on my cell phone!"
2,Wilson Electronics 301103 Dual Band 8001900 MHz Magnet Mount,"I bouhg this product with the Wilson cell phone signal amplifier, the amplifier works very good, but the problem was the conector of this antena is diferent than the conector of the amplifier. In the page of amazon the suggest to buy this antena with the amplifier but its dont work together.I dont recoment this product to use with the Wilson cel phone signal amplifier."
2,Save your money,The illustrations are nice. The instruction consists mostly of showing a drawing with a few general comments thrown in. I learned very little from this book.
2,it's great ... but ....,"What a wonderful array of textures possible with watercolorsbutif you already have ""Creating Textures in pen & ink with Watercolor""don't, i repeat, don't buy this one because it is exactly the sametext/illustration block. Identical!Very Disappointing!"
5,Drawing aid,"In combination with other books by Claudia Nice, an artist will learn new techniques for pen and ink. I have started drawing again since I retired and this has been a real help. Great book!!!"
5,"Practical,Helpfull guide","I was very impressed with the practical advice offered in this book. I was able to look up specific conditions and find out the treatment.If you only ever purchase one book on whole body healing, I would reccommend this one, as it spans from components of the body to chakras to herbal ,color and even massage therapy."
1,Fail.,"I assembled the unit (kudos to the makers for how easy that was, seriously), but a piece snapped off or loose (not clear upon examination because the spring-loaded actuator is no longer visible--it's stuck down inside the lower half of the unit), causing the handle grip to not open the jaws any longer. This happened within five minutes of assembly. Poor quality of the actuator rod seems to be at fault here. I would not recommend this item. However, we own the smaller, hand-operated version of this product and love it. It couldn't be more perfect, provided you don't mind bending to pick up the waste. We bought this longer version because we like the shorter one so much. Too bad it isn't made better."
3,LH Scoop and Pack,It does work and could be useful to some. There needs to be a better way of keeping the bag up and the handle isn't very long so you can't stand up straight. I think a shovel works better in the yard and Mutt Mitt type bags when on the go.
1,Poorly designed,"The locking mechanism is poorly designed and requires manual manipulation (I used the handle of a spoon) in order to open and close the jaw of the scoop. Otherwise, it remains locked in position, either open or closed. Obviously, this is not practical when outside with a dog. I am returning this item."
5,Outstanding classic,"i wish more ""statesmen"" and politicians would read along with The Wealth and Poverty of Nations. This provides excellent analysis and statistics of why countries like the UK went into the crapper."
5,Required text for those who attend U. S. Army Ranger School.,"This field manual explains infantry tacticts taught in U. S. Army Ranger School, and is a required text for those who go there. It covers leadership, battle drills, order formats, etc."
1,Amazon should be ashamed to sell this book.,"What little information could be read in this book was informative, but there is one huge problem.This book is nothing but a collection of photo-copied pages, with most of the pages only covering approximatley 3/4 of the book's page. This makes it incredibly hard to read. Worse yet, the pages with diagrams, drawings, or photographs are completely unreadable.I suspect that the folks who gave this book 5 star ratings are somehow connected to publisher or the writer.I urge Amazon to view this book and pull it from their inventory. They offer an excellent service and should not have their reputation tarnished with a product such as this."
1,Dissappoited,This is extremely low quality. Looks like something I could have printed off my computer and stapled together. Warning to all
4,Great Read,"Definitely interesting, though it's a dry read. It's worth a buy simply because it's so fascinating if you're a military buff or a paintball buff."
3,Get hopped-up for Dennis Hopper,"The premise for Riders of the Storm is engaging nonsense: A bunch of misfit Veit Nam vets run a pirate radio from a B-29 bomber, avoiding arrest by never landing for 20 years. Hilarity ensues. Plenty of camp, sight gags, and belly laughs, but a choppy story line, bad editing, and paper-thin characters are all proof: you shouldn't make movies when you're high. Better toke up if you want to overlook the holes in this plot. Hopper and Pollard are as credible as possible. You'll enjoy this upbeat farce if you don't expect too much, but don't try it when you're straight."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I bought this cd because of Norah Jones being on it, but was disappointed in the rest of the music. I prefer the New York City cd which features Norah Jones."
3,Easy Listening,A relaxing and refreshing CD. The songs have many different approaches but all are well worth listening to. I would recommend this CD.
3,A worthwhile book for the opportunity pathfinder's bookshelf,"It is easy to read as it is printed in large format. It gives a relatively good overview of opportunity discovery concepts/ideas but does not give much detailed information regarding the systematic process of decision-making and action planning. By comparison, Edward de Bono's Opportunities (or even Michel Robert's The Innovation Formula) is a much better book, especially its detailed coverage on the startpoint, endpoint strategies and evaluation strategies towards opportunity discovery. Also, the latter's coverage of the If-box opportunity mapping process is a gem. Nevertheless, Opportunity Spotting is still a worthwhile book to be included in an opportunity pathfinder's library."
1,Avoid Basic Essentials Teflon Sticks to your Food,I bought a Basics Essentials teflon coated set at Shopko. The first time I cooked with them the teflon came off onto the noodles and hamburger I cooked. The company warranty is that they would replace it if you send them another $8. Why would I want to replace them and eat more teflon! After using them several times and gently cleaning them all the teflon was gone and rust appeared! Happened on 2 of the 5 pans I tried. Also happened to the set I gave to my daughter as a gift. Buy Tramontina teflon or tri ply stainless steel cookware. Love Tramontina - great quality. Basic Essential pans are the worse ever.
1,I'd rather cook in a microwave forever than ever use these again!!!!,"HORRID stuff! The 'teflon' has come off, then they've rusted, the pots have all become warped so lids don't fit. The set was originally $130 but I got them on a Black Friday deal in 2009. Got rid of all my other cookware thinking these would be fabulous. It's so nice to be cooking something (especially for a 1 year old and 5 year old) when suddenly there are black flecks throughout the food -- more teflon coming off. You either spend an hour trying to pick everything out to salvage the food or you give up and throw the whole thing out. WASTE OF MONEY ALL THE WAY AROUND!!"
1,Worst cookware ever,"I agree with other reviewers. Rust, coating peals off, food burns and sticks...thought I got a great bargain. I am shopping once again for cookware."
2,Cracked handles,I have to agree with the previous review. We bought a set of cookware for our beach house a year ago and the handles are all now cracked! These pot and pans are not even used everyday and I do take care of them. I would not buy this brand again.
2,Don't bother with Basic Essentials,I bought this set (not through Amazon so no reflection on them) and it was just fine for less than a year. Then the lid handles all cracked and now I've notice the actual pot handle on the larger pot has cracked down the entire length. I don't baby my kitenware but then I don't throw it around the room either. I'd pass this over and find something better.
4,Smells Wonderful,"I have an inside dog with LOTS of fur and has to have frequent baths. I was worried about drying out the dog's skin with all the washing and my research brought me here, so I decided to give it a try. I'm not so sure that it doesn't wash out flea/tick topicals (after frequent washings.. one bath or two? Maybe not. 4-5 in a month that they're supposed to last? Probably).What I will say is that I would recommend this (and plan to buy again, in a larger container) for the smell alone. I hate most dog shampoo scents, but this has a wonderful clean coconut scent and despite the ""no soap/detergent"" mantra, it lathers and gets the dirt out pretty much just as well as any shampoo that does have that stuff. I think it just comes down to scrubbing it out anyway, more so than the detergents."
5,Fabulous!,"I love this perfume, I wish it came in more sizes but I purchased the big one because I used up my mini! On your skin it starts with bright, sweet floral tones then mellows to a soft bright vanilla like scent. If you spray clothing it stays just as it is out of the bottle. It is a great daytime perfume. I sometimes put it on when I get home just as a pick me up because it makes me feel better :) I tend to like sweeter perfumes with floral & or vanilla overtones. If you do, I would highly recommend Wish."
5,Incredible book!,This book is one of the most fascinating books for me. This book will bring significant new insight to the art of jazz improvisation.
2,Generally a disappointment,"Perhaps I had expected too much. My wife is confined to a nursing home with a rare parkinson type disease and I was hoping this book might help.Instead of helping, the knowledge from books read earlier made me notice the many errors in this book - caused, I believe, by trying to make the book more readable. It also made it less accurate.There are few miracles - PS is not one of them. If it were it would be in universal use.A much better book, in my estimation, is ""Mind Boosters"" by Ray Sahelian, M.D."
1,Save your money,"I was so disappointed with this final book in the series. It's nothing more than a complete rehash of what happened in the first 5 books. Granted it comes from the point of view of Hope's sister, Spirit, the vast majority of content was just cut-and-pasted from the original books. I kept reading through the book in the hopes that there'd be a continuation of the story after Hope's death, but very little was added.While Piers Anthony's books are almost always guaranteed to be a good read, the lack of original content in this one was a complete let-down.I guess some work is for art, and some is to pay the rent. This was definitely the latter."
5,A great ending to an entertaining series,"The Bio series is arguably the male equivalent of ""50 Shades of Grey"" in that it certainly has MORE sexual escapades than that book. Still, the storyline is very intriguing and the final book of the series does a great job of not only closing out certain sections and plot lines, but comfortably ending the series in a satisfying way. If you have read the Bio series, you owe it to yourself to buy this book."
4,Recommended with Caveats,"I've had 2-3 Swatches over the years, and was looking for a replacement for sports/sauna/etc activity. The Once Again is a typical ""clean"" Swatch design, but I find the day/date to be very distracting when glancing at the watch-it seems that the minute hand is stuck at approximately :15 every time I look at it!Pros:Simple designComfortableCons:Day/Date makes it look like minute hand is stuck at :15Face is a bit small for a typical man's wristBand could be biggerBand can't be replaced (from what I can see)"
5,Cooool watch,"For the price, this watch is very nice looking and reliable. I bought a walnut-colored leather wristband for it off of ebay and it looks really cool now. I don't like ""showy"" watches though, just cool-looking ones. And this one looks pretty cool with a brown leather wristband.I'm a graduate student with a bad sense of time, so this watch is perfect for my busy schedule and lack of expendable money. I absolutely need the date on my watch too. For a 40-dollar watch, it's pretty much everything I need."
1,Weak straps and hidden conditions on warranty,"Watch out when buying these watches. The watch straps are weak, and Swatch only honors any suggested warranties if the seller has some kind of authorized dealer stamp, which my seller - an Amazon partner - did not.My strap broke within a month of purchase. Neither Amazon nor the seller could help me fix the strap or get any kind of refund.I know it was not a once off because I mailed my watch in to the seller to be replaced and they accidentally sent me back two watches with the same problem (one to my old and one to my new address). Obviously they must have watches with broken straps just lying around."
2,unhappy with purchase,The date feature on my swatch watch is all out of whack. It never holds the right date. Other than that it is a ok watch but for this price everything should work correctly and for product it is not the case.
1,"too small, feels like a girls watch. very fragile and cheap feeling. and it squeaks.","it squeaks, it feels SOOO cheap, and i just scrapped it a little and its all scratched. i feel like a b**** using that watch, i gave it to my sister and it fits perfectly on her."
3,Not so bad,"I bought it because in the picture it looked like very similar to another model I used to have and for an everyday watch it's okay.What annoys me a bit is the tic-tac sound which is very loud and sometimes while working it bothers.I will not return it since I'd been wearing it for a while, outdoors or doing my housework you don't even notice the noise, but if you work in a peaceful environment I wouldn't recommend it at all."
3,Detailed Digital Asset Management,"I purchased this book for a college course. It is repetetive about what one would use a DAM system for, but on the other hand very detailed. Very easy to follow and understand. Good real world examples of what can go wrong on a project, and how DAM systems can help. Good if you can get this book for a lower price. I got it for $20 on Amazon. Would have been sad to spend cover price."
5,"upliftingly funny, great for when I'm in a funk","this book is found in one of my local libraries and it helps me to get out of my adult depressions. I'm especially enamored of the guy in the Chinese Restaurant who's asked by the waiter, ""Wonton?"" and his reply is ""Not now!"""
5,accessible wisdom,"What I love about this book is that weeks later I can still remember Baldwin's seven whispers and have been able to incorporate them into my busy life. I know I should be doing a better job at whisper #2, ""Move at the pace of guidance,"" but even at the pace I'm moving I find these lovely sayings and the essays that accompany them reside in my mind. Many times a day they float to the surface of my mind and help me stay connected to spirit all week long. This book lives on my bedside table and I read little paragraphs over and over. It's a great gift. I've bought half a dozen copies for people of different religious persuasions and they all like it as much as I do."
4,Great scent,I've worn the non-light version of this scent and loved it. I've smelled this version and liked it as well and will order this to replace my finished non-light version since it seems to be no longer available.
2,WARNING!!!! LEAKY BOTTLE,This product says slightly leaked in transit - however it was still dripping and was about a third missing. Very disappointed. I have requested a return - and they at least seemed very willing to help out there.
2,"Barely watchable, highly predictable","Very predictable story. In the forty some reviews for the VHS there are a lot of comments on bad acting. I agree, but the bad acting is not from the 3 main adult characters. Parts of story not very believable. They've gotten along for years, then all of a sudden the father is tripping on items in his barn that he's worked in for decades. Everyone's near death, but manages to survive. Plus no characters look like people back then would have looked. More like California actors."
4,Good tunes,What a talented guy. Steve Holy sings some great songs on this CD. I'm surprised that he is not more popular. I also recommend Steve Holy - Blue Moon.
5,love it,"Steve Holy has an excellent voice, I really enjoyed the lyrics.The music is easy to listen to, I would buy more of his music"
1,Cracked,The big one cracked at the weak part along the slot for the adjuster bolt. This is Channellock's definitive tool and should be done better. I'm going to pay a little more for Knipex next time.
5,You can't go wrong with Channel Locks,"As the title says, there is nothing bad I can say about these. They do the job. Sure, you can buy slightly cheaper brands, but in the long run, these are the best."
5,From Winter to Autumn,Beth Gibbons brings us a truly unique and enlightening debut album. The music is distinctly different than her work with Portishead. The electronic feel is gone and replaced with an almost jazzy feel. But what remains is Gibbons' haunting and soulful voice. Her talent to convey her emotion to us and feel her every whisper. Very mellow and a great album to set any casual mood.
4,"Some brilliant, some good, and a few ambitious failures","(Forgive me for failing to write in the 'struggling music critic' style that is characteristics of so many Amazon.com reviews.)Let's face it: the two Portishead albums were brilliant pieces of music. They were concept albums in the truest sense; each told a coherent story through their songs. This is not an album of that caliber. It does, however, contain moments of brilliance. ""Tom the model,"" aside from having a silly title, is an excellent song, and it compares quite favorably to Gibbons' work with Portishead. ""Mysteries,"" ""Drake,"" and ""Spider Monkey"" are haunting and original. The rest of the album varies from 'competent' (""Sand River"") to 'ambitious failure' (""Romance""--an atrocious song, but I get what they were going for). All in all, it's worth the price. Beth Gibbons is to be applauded for her work on this album. Let's hope that it inspires her and her collaborators to strive to something that is Portishead quality."
3,little disappointed,"After seeing everybody give this 5 stars, I guess I was bound to be let down. Shame on me for buying without listening to a song. I agree that Beth has a great voice, I just can not get attached to most of the songs on this disc."
3,I'm Sad,"I'll miss Portishead! She's sounds great, don't get me wrong. It's just that, I loved the Portishead sound and now it's gone forever."
1,Sad and Sobbing,"Usually Beth's Voice from Portishead gives a great meloncholy mood, but this album just make you sad that you bought it. It feels like no effort was placed on this horrid CD. A truly nonispired, drug induced (which is worse that drug inspired ;) sad sad sad piece of work."
4,Great Stocking Stuffer,I bought this for my niece and I can't put it down. It is so funny to watch this guy dance by flipping the pages! I know she will love it and it is small enough to fit in a stocking.
5,"For a flip book, GOSH! What'd you expect?!","It is just a flip book, but you can see him dance as fast or as slow as you like. I am trying to learn the dance, and although it is not perfect, it helps. :)"
2,Napoleon Dynamite: Flippin' Sweet!,"I was really disappointed when I received this flip book in the mail. When it arrived the edges of the book were bent/damaged and it looked like it had been used although I ordered a new book. I was embarrassed to give it to my friend because he would have assumed that I had flipped through the book a bajillion times before giving it to him. It's a fantastic product, but next time I think I'll purchase the book at a store instead."
3,Napolean Pleases,This is definitely for Napolean Dynamite fans. My son can't get enough of him. This little book will be a nice stocking stuffer!
4,Good product!,It is a Great product! It's a good and cheap option! It works very well...!! I definitely recommend it... !
4,I like the shirt...BUT,"The shirt is nice, I do like it, however it is pretty thin. This is a problem because you get the feeling the the quality is bad and its easy to see through it. But it will do."
2,Not Heavyweight as Advertised,I sought a heavyweight 3/4 length shirt and sadly I'm still looking for one even after purchasing this shirt. I have undershirts that I've washed for years that are of heavier material & quality than this shirt.
3,A little thin,I wanted the fabric to be a little thicker and less flimsy than it is. Other than that it feels just fine.
1,Wrong shirt twice!,"I ordered this shirt twice for my son. The first one that arrived was black and white but the colors were reversed, the body of the shirt in black and the sleeves white. Since my son needed it already he just used it anyway and so I ordered anew for his birthday only to get the same thing. I did not bother to request for return anymore, I just vowed not to order from this seller ever."
4,More like midweight,"This item is worth the money, but there are a couple minor shortcomings in my opinion. First off, I'd say this was more a mid-weight shirt, not heavyweight. Second, one sleeve was slightly tighter than the other, Not abig deal, but it was slightly different. Still, I think you get what you pay for with this shirt."
3,Baseball tee,The material is a bit itchy.I thought it would be softer. I would not buy again. I really like 3/4 length sleeves.
5,Good purchase,"I am very pleased with my purchase of t shirts. Nice weight, good quality, good value. Bought several for winter time undershirts."
5,Nice Quality Shirt,Really like the heavy weight. True size which has held throughout several washings. Great winter undershirts and warm weather tees. Sleeves stay out of the way!!
4,Good buy,I purchased the baseball tee and love it. Fits perfect and was a cheap buy. I definitely will be purchasing more in the near future.
3,Gift,This was bought as a gift. Not much to be said about a T-shirt. The recipient hasn't yet worn it so I'm not sure if the sizing was accurate.
4,good product,I needed this product quickly and the company was easy to work with. The product has held up after serveral washes
4,My Favorite Shirt! well at least my black sleeved shirt,"So I bought two shirts one with black sleeves and one with red, The black shirt is amazing I love it,and the red one? well its somewhere at the bottom of my closet, it was just too small! I ordered it as a XL and it says XL but it fits like a large/medium. I am overall happy with the black sleeved shirt and will possibly get another black one."
5,Good shirt,This is a good shirt for a great price. I bought this because I usually have bad luck with T shirts regarding sizes (i.e. too small most of the time). This is great! It is the right size and fits well. Highly recommend it.
3,Strung out story disapoints,"This book continues the story of the Streaker but continuesit almost beyond human endurance. End the saga and lets getonto something more interesting. David Brin, please let thembe"
3,Page turner but in the wrong sense,"This book is part of a highly entertaining series. BUT, I found that tens of pages could be skipped without loss of plot thread. Moreover, the character development of 80% of the characters was too slight to warrant further attention. Nonetheless, those of us who slogged through the rest of the series would want to read this and the last 50 pages are gripping. Of course, those last pages end as a cliffhanger so that you will buy the next book.Yet another instance of a series which would be much more memorable in 1/3 the total page count."
2,"Better, but not by much","""Brightness Reef"" was a dog, and I read this one only because of the return of the wonderful characters from ""Startide Rising"". Enduring the rambling style wasn't worth it, with the writing seemingly done by a different person. Do not bother with this or with book three."
4,A little long but very good,"Unlike the book before it, I was unable to put this one down! Quite a page turner. Brin seems to write two types of books: the ones that you can't put down from the start, and the ones you have to force yourself to finish.Fortunately, this one falls under the first category.Finally, after struggling to complete Brightness Reef (one of the slowest Brin Novels I think I have ever read. I finished two other book while still reading that one.) everything seems to fall into place.I would definitely recommend this book, but it's a shame you have to read Brightness Reef to fully appreciate it. Oh well. Can't win 'em all."
3,Average Brin,"Brin finally reveals what is going on and a lot of background that helps make the story more interesting. This book definitely doesn't stand alone though. It also ends in a heck of a cliffhanger. Not Brin's best stuff, but not bad either as science fiction goes."
2,disappointing and way too long,"This review applies to David Brin's new Uplift trilogy as a whole.I loved Brin's other Uplift books but the new Uplift trilogy is a long-winded dud. It introduces a few enticing ideas, but constantly gets bogged down in useless character development and leaves way too many loose ends without resolving anything. This entire trilogy could have easily been condensed into a single volume, and at least two-thirds of the characters eliminated completely, without losing any of the core content. As it is, the three volumes lack continuity and the main ideas and characters introduced in the beginning turn out to have no relevance in the end. NOT RECOMMENDED."
1,"Disappointing with little substance. Whimsical, personal.","The publisher's review is misleading as there is only very limited information on the topics listed. The many illustrations promised,which attracted me to buy the book (unseen), are for the most part uninteresting since many are old photos (like a rowing team from many years ago!), or typical ""travel scraps"", or a page from a dictionary, etc. This is best described as a whimsical scrapbook of her present and her past memories of the area. However, she is indeed an artist; every page is artistically composed."
4,Spindle not threaded,Spindle was not threaded and luckily I had the taps I needed on hand. Otherwise you would need someone tap it for you.
4,"so far, sooo goooood","i don't usually do this, not having finished the book, but was just checking to see what amazon's price was on this one... just paid $22 at barnes and noble, doh! anyway, this book is really good so far, haven't been able to put it down. i have been intrigued by MP for as long as i've known about him, but info on him is scarce and dubious. until now... mr.doherty writes a well thought out, biography (so far) and i can only imagine how difficult this story was to research, so kudos to you sean! great photos too."
5,One of my favorite books,I loved this book. It was so sad and I started crying. I love how this author writes this book and it made me feel like I was there. Once I started reading this book I couldn't stop and I didn't concentrate on anything else. I love sad stories and if you liked this one I recommend you to read Sort Of Forever By Sally Warner.
5,A Summer to Die,"Do you think Meg in the story A Summer to Die was happy when she gets stuck sharing a room with her older sister, Molly? Well guess what, she wasn't because she couldn't stand her sister's beauty! They moved to a smaller country, so Meg has to get used to a lot of things. As the sister just got used to the house, Meg feels Molly is being a real grump. Her complaint is not new. When Molly was rushed to the hospital, Meg has to trust the fact that something is wrong with her sister. That's the day Meg's world has changed. Do you think it is too late to sow what Meg really feels about her sister? Do you think Molly dies?"
3,ANOTHER TEENAGE WEEPIE,"Well,the title tells you what to expect, so have your hanky handy! In this story told in the first person, a 13-year-old girl finally realizes that her older sister is dying. The family of 4 has moved to an old house in the country, so Dad can finish writing his book; yet our young and plain heroine is disgusted that she has to share a bedroom with her pretty and popular older sister.Meg experiences many emotions towards her sister that year, until Molly becomes seriously ill. Meg also makes friends with unusual new, hippy-type neighbors and a kindly, bachelor photographer. That summer she learns a lot about herself, her talents (for they exist, but are not like Molly's) and her own, innate value as a human being, a sister and a daughter. In these 11 short chapters Ms Lowry offers great insight into the complexity of adolescence, as well as the acceptance of the death of a family member."
5,Best book I will ever read!!,I thought this book was truly spectacular because of the amount of details used. There weren't too many and there weren't too little. I seriously could not put the book down. I read 3/4 of the book in 1 1/2 hours. Also it explains what could happen in real life. I was truly amazed by this book!
2,Sad,"This book is not only something you could just cry over, it has no happiness inside. I would recomened it to those people who would like to read more about the darker part of life."
3,Lots of random numbers. OK book.,"This book is very sad ( it was ok) But the thing is, it has about 50 numbers floating around in it. A summer to die was overall a good book. For people that want to know the sad part of life."
2,Digital edition is not good,"I bought the Kindle edition in a fit of nostalgia. In the first three chapters I think I encountered half a dozen page numbers, left over from the print edition, in the middle of the text. Typos everywhere, misspellings, chunks of text missing from the middle of paragraphs. And if you're particular about things like typography, the constant straight-quotes and crashing characters will feel like sand in your socks. I returned it after half an hour and plan to pursue my nostalgia with a print copy."
3,Warning; description of live birth!,"I would screen this book before letting your younger children read it for two reasons. One; I remember reading this book as a young teen in Jr. High and it really depressed me. As others have mentioned, I didn't find a lot of resolution at the end. So be warned that it's a very emotional book with a troubling topic which was really complicated by her family's lack of communication. Two; I remember Meg witnessing a home birth so if you don't want to deal with that topic I wouldn't recommend this book as there are others out there that deal with cancer and/or sibling rivalry. I can't remember how much detail there was about the birth, but it was graphic enough that I remember it happening and thinking ""oh...my"". I had already had sex ed and witnessed a birth on video. Most Jr. high and teen girls would handle it okay, but it might be an eye opener for anyone younger than that."
1,A very depressing book something I wouldn't recommend.,This is not just a bad book it is a horrible book. I was forced to read it in school.
4,Excellent Beginner's Book,"After wrestling with the venerable George Bain, I turned to this book to get a handle on Celtic knotwork. Sheila Sturrock breaks down the framework of knots into simple, basic shapes, allowing the reader to start making decorative knots within minutes of picking up the book. It proved to be a good starting point for me."
4,Informative and easy to follow,"excellent, easy to follow step-by-step instructions and illustrations of drawing celtic knots. includes:heartsloopscornersmotifsanimalsplantsi found this book to be an excellent source for the absolute beginner of celtic knot drawing. the author managed to simpifly a most complex subject by short verbal instruction mixed with detailed illustrations. all forms of celtic knots and loops are covered and variations of those are offered as well.the author further shows her knowlegde of this timeless art by including a chapter on coloring and shading your knotwork.if you're looking to begin making celtic knots the moment you open the book, then this book is for you."
5,A GREAT SPORTS BOOK,"I love basketball and this is a great story. It's so great, in fact that I have read it twice! I reccomend this book to anyone because it really showes that size doesn't matter."
5,A great book for kids.,Mike Lupica displayed the life of a heartbroken boy that amazed me. Almost every major point in the movie related to something I had encountered as well. The novel showed how friendship and perseverance triumphs over anything. I rate this book as one of the best I had ever read.
3,"Good, but it could have been better","I liked the book. I am 10 years old and it had some bad words. I asked my dad and he told me to read it and review it and to put that in my review. We talked about the words and I really think the author could have said ""ticked off"" and other things instead of the words he chose. My dad says that perhaps the author doesn't respect his audience and I get what he means. I just wish it could have been worded differently in places so more kids could read it and it could maybe have been even a better book. I'm not sure kids should read this. I think you need to be older. I also think that if it's not alright for a kid, it's really not alright for adults either."
3,Read this book,"Travel Team is a good book. It's kind of like the movie Miracle. You should read this book because it's exciting and has suspenseful parts. When Danny gets cut from the basketball travel team, he and his dad get all the other kids and become a team. Their team lost a lot of games but won some too. When playoffs start Danny's dad gets in a car wreck and he's in the hospital. The team needs to get a coach quickly. Read the book to find out what they do."
4,A Fine Read,"I've spent many years involved in youth Basketball and Lupica captures it very well. Both my young son and I enjoyed the book, and the basketball games themselves flowed nicely. A little hackneyed backstory (in youth basketball the little guys are the stars as bigger kids grow into their coodination so the ""poor little guy"" angle was tough to take) but it's all well presented and the targeted audience will believe.Overall something to recommend."
4,Travel Team a Great Story,"Travel Team is a Real ""Round Ball Heart Warmer ""as said in the very back of the book. It is a underdog story of sad and happy. Danny a short boy is trying out for the 7th grade travel team, but he does not make his dream. He loves the sport, but after this catastrophe he thinks he'll skip it for the year. Instead his dad makes his own team. At first the team is not so good, but they get better as the wonderful year goes by. They get better. I wish I could tell you more, but you're just going to have to read the book I would highly recommend this book and the sequel Summer Ball."
5,The best sports novel I read in a while,"I recently recieved this book for Christmas from my parents. I easily knocked this book off in two nights staying up until about 1 a.m the second night to finish the book. It was great i showed that even the kids that get left off the ""big"" team can still be very good and win. Also it was modernized using current players and apperal by these players such as Lebrons and Iversons. I hope and pray he rights a continuation of this book"
1,Boring,"This Book is for the kind of people who like to read diologue. There needs to be more basketball for a book to be Called ""Travel Team"""
5,AWESOME!,"This book, after i found it randomly in my school library, soon became my favorite book. I can make many connections with this book to my life. I love how Lupica describes the characters so vividly that i can picture them in my head perfectly. I highly suggest that if you like this book as much as i do, then i reccomend reading Heat,also by Mike Lupica. All in all, this was a great book, so enjoy reading!"
1,VERY BAD LANGUAGE,"I was very disappointed in the language in this book. Within the first 15 pages it had taken God's name in vain and had lots of other curse words. I was ashamed to know schools would have such books available for our children to read. The story line is very good, but had foul language that my children are not exposed to. I was upset to say the least. Unless you are used to bad language and taking God's name in vain, then I would not recommend this book."
1,Boaring!!!!!!!!!!!!!,it is a easy bouring book you can read the first 3 chapters and you can prediked the rest becouse it tells you evry thing right away I rekamen this book to 2ent graders.
3,"Good book, but a little vague.","I read this book within two days of receiving it from Amazon.com. Although the book did provide me with some elements of educational advice, it was probably 70% useless to me and entirely too redundant. For the reader looking for more specific offshore investment advice, I'd suggest you look elsewhere. In this book, Jerome does provide some offshore advice that is painted with a rather broad brush, but it is inconclusive. I also have Jerome's ""Complete Guide to Offshore Money Havens"" and perhaps it will provide further insight. If you are interested in general techniques for deceiving your spouse or significant other, this book offers some good common sense instruction."
4,TYA,"Good playing on the speeding boogie blues that Alvin made his name on. Still love Chick's understated organ on this disk, Ric's pounding and Leo's backbeat."
3,A bit lacking by TYA standards,"You Give Me Loving and Standing at the Station are excellent- these two bluesy tracks rock hard with a dark emotive edge. As for the rest..the album was recorded with a dark, reverby but slightly flat sound mix that works pretty well for the two aforementioned tracks but less well for the other more basic blues or rock numbers like Choo Choo Mama which is pretty much what the rest of the album is.Overall the band (IOW Alvin Lee who was 90% of the band really) seems to be a bit lacking in inspiration, new ideas and energy. Soundwise I prefer the clean immediate sound mix that was employed on similar but more lively material they laid down on Ssssh a few years earlier. For the best fully mature TYA recording the predecessor to this, A Space in Time, is far superior and is at worst a near classic."
5,In My Top 5 Favorite Anime,"Kanon, Volume 1I love Kanon and can't wait to get my hands on volume 4. It is visually beautiful and really appeals to all of your senses....but most of a...is the story....which ties in to Air, yet another series and movie, which I highly recommend.What are the other anime in my Top 5? Easy:Blood+Hoshi no Koe (aka Voices of A Distant Star)Air (the series and movie)...and last but by no means least...5 Centimeters Per Second.It's not that I don't love more action packed anime, but the above named speak to something deeper in the human spirit...male and female...."
4,"Typical, yet with a new idea..worth a try imo","Nothing puts me to sleep more than a new face on an old idea. If you like the Melancoly of HS then this might interest you.Not to give anything away, but the town in this anime certainly attracts amnesiac's....v.1 is early to give a definative judgement, but for me its worth preordering v.2voice: eh, average.animation: good (average if you dislike square eyes).story: very good. new to me, sort of in the area of Haruhi and Noein...only not."
5,A beautiful Archive of the history and passion of a marque,"I found the book a touching and beautiful archive to the passion and history that has made Ducati the global success that it is today. The book is neither a technical book nor a minute chronology of the motorcycle's every intricacy, but a marvelous coffee table book tat can be picked up by Ducatisti and non enthusiasts alike, even if you just pick out your date of birth or the year you started college etc. The archive photographs suppied by Motociclismo are exquisite and the quality of the print and ease of design make for a book which is truly a delight to behold. I am sure that the cover alone would sell as a photographic print in its own right. For a trip down yesterday, today and tommorrow's roads, it cannot be beaten."
3,fair,product arrived damaged with the plastic attachment to fasten the toy to the cage.not worth the postage to send back.
1,Lack of information,I had read this series & enjoyed. I purchased for a loved one who is incarnated. I find out that they are cassette tapes not CD's. being the situation we cannot return not are they of any use to my loved one. I had hoped to give inspiration now I can only provide nothing
4,Quality product,This is a quality product which I use most days. Blade truly locks with spare blades on board. Always a sharp blade.
3,Dificl de mantener,Se piede peso quitando todos los carbohidratos de la dieta? Si. Es posible mantener esa dieta de por vida? Muy dificil. Se recupera el peso al volver a comer carbohidratos y azucares (incluso jugo de naranja es un 'no no'). SI.
5,Excellent,"This is the first book by Henty I've read, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. I suppose I judge a book by its cover a little to much, and I was putting off reading this book because I wasn't too excited about reading a book written a really long time ago. But after I started, I had a tough time putting it down. Sure, the plot was simplistic, but there was plenty of action to keep me occupied. Be forewarned, however - I'm a high school student, and there were a lot of words in that book that I didn't know the meaning of. Unless your command of old english is pretty good, you will probably have some trouble with some of those words. But don't let that stop you - read the book with a dictionary close at hand. It isn't often that you get to read an exciting book and learn a pile of new words while you do it! Overall, this is a great book for any kid or kid at heart who has the patience to consult the dictionary every now and then."
2,needs a garter belt to stay up,"I bought these stockings to wear on a long flight, but before I had even gotten to the airport they had fallen down below my knees. I ended up buying regular stockings at walmart along the way to the airport."
3,Fine for bed rest,"The other reviews are correct that the stockings are loose at the top and can slip down. I am on bed rest, thus they are fine for my needs."
4,Great price,This is a great product for the price. I have approx. 25 african chichlids that are in a 70 gal tank they greatly enjoy this product as a dry fish food option
3,Selling this book used?,"Hey, I love Apple trivia as much as the next guy, but honestly, are people really going to buy a ""Bathroom Reader"" used?Has Seinfeld taught us nothing?"
4,Fun -- but when's the new edition coming?,"The Mac Bathroom Reader is one of the more quirky books about Apple Computer and its equally unusual story. Mostly filled with trivia relating to the most obscure Macintosh information, this is definitely a book for serious Mac users or those who really get into Silicon Valley culture.It's also great in telling the first two parts of the Steve Jobs tale, his rise and his fall. Unfortunately, as this book was published before Jobs' return in 1997, it is missing a large part of recent Apple history, including the creation of the iMac, Microsoft's 'grant' to Apple, and the beginning of Mac OS X.In any case, Linzmayer's storytelling skills are sharp and playful in this book and no serious Mac fan should be without it."
4,Ultimate Mac trivia book,"As noted by another reviewer, there is an overlap with Apple Confidential, but they're not the same.This book has the answer to various trivia questions (including stuff about third party vendors). The other is organized more as a history, and has a lot of new material about things such as clone licenses that was not available when the Bathroom Reader was published.Both books are written by a very knowledgeable true believer, although there is definitely criticism of inept management in Confidential (Bathroom Reader is more positive in tone).So if you want a history to read start to finish, buy Apple Confidential. If you want something to read a page or two at a time -- say, IN THE BATHROOM -- then this is a better book."
5,"Awesome. A ""MUST HAVE"" for any true Apple/Macintosh fan.","As an Apple enthusiast, I personally recommend this book. Along with Insanely Great, they give you an inside look into what really went on during the early days of the Macintosh. Having been thrust into the midst of that world recently, and dealing with the limelight of the MacUniverse, this book helped me see the truth amidst all of the lies. Thanks Owen!"
2,Misleading Title,"Am I the only reader who had a problem with a Macintosh book bearing the warm and fuzzy title of ""The Mac Bathroom Reader"" turning out to be full of negativity? The author seemed determined to wipe out any positive feeling the readers might have for Steve Jobs, quoting every criticism anyone ever made of him but leaving out much of the good stuff. If you are into debunking heroes, you'll love this book. Otherwise, choose a book with a more balanced approach such as Insanely Great."
1,Dangerous product,"This French licorice is delicious, but dangerous. If you use too much of it, it can give you high blood pressure and even heart failure. This happened to me after using about one of these little cans per day over several months. Luckily, this effect is reversible, but if you are unaware, it could land you in an ER."
4,Not sweet-tasting candy; it's a breath freshener,"This breath mint is hard, like coal, not chewy. Fortunately, it doesn't taste like coal; it tastes like the strongest black licorice you'd ever want and maybe more. I wouldn't have guessed there is any sugar in it at all. It's similar to eating baker's chocolate because it is definitely a strong flavor but not sweet.Ingredient list, as best as I can translate:licorice; sugar; starch; aromas [flavors]: powder of catechu [acacia], iris powder, natural mint aroma, mastic tree resin; lactose; dye: E153; coating agents: beeswax, carnauba wax, vegetable oil; vegetable fat; gelatinI give it four stars because it probably provides what it claims: ""an inimitable taste, scents the breath, provides healthy and pleasant freshness"" (translation), and it definitely tastes like licorice, but it is probably fair to say it is harsh rather than delicate. I thought I'd throw it away at first. Now I'm on my second container. I've had it for about two years..."
3,"The best thing for breath, not so crazy about the taste","This tins, are small and practical, they hold a great number of licorice pieces, tiny but strong! they are really great refreshing your mouth for long periods of time. The taste, well, you have to get use to it, then you come to like it, but for the most of people that give it a try they hate the taste. In my case, I guess I acquired the taste, I actually like it now."
2,Hard to eat,"These little ""mints"" were given to me as a gift because I love licorice and anise flavored things. In addition, I enjoy things that aren't very sweet. I was disappointed to discover that they tasted more like burnt shoe polish than licorice."
2,Good but skimpy,"For true Eva Cassidy lovers, this is a nice addition to your collection, but it only has 2 songs on it. Invest in her other albums and honor her memory as one of the great rock/blues singers in her short lifetime."
1,This is not an album - only 2 songs & home-made video,"Before you plunk down your money, know that this is NOT an album:This is only 2 songs and a home-made video without sound of Evaplaying live at Blues Alley. If that video is worth the money, ok, goahead, but it only plays on your computer if you have the particularsoftware capability. And then you will be looking at grainy video withno sound.Still interested?"
5,ladyd802003@yahoo.com,This book is very thought provoking Author Anthony Bailey expresses feelings and views on life that are ignored by some and never expressed.It restores thoughts forgotten back to life as a page turner. Heart-felt
1,Still haven't received product after three weeks!,"I order this product three weeks ago, and I still ahve not gotten it. Although, the status says shopped, it has not made it to me."
1,these are not the droids you are looking for,"This is NOT happy hardcore- a form of hardcore, I'll grant, but in no way is it happy. No soaring piano solos, no uplifting female vocals- it just doesn't make you feel good like happy hardcore should. This, along with the earlier and similar Happy Happy Hardcore cd, should be avoided at all costs."
1,One star is one star too many!,"Be warned! There is not one track here that is considered true happy hardcore. Check out the Anabolic Frolic series or the ""Happyhardcorefoundation"" series from DJ BRISK and you'll know what I'm talking about. I've been listing to Happy Hardcore for years and I've never heard of ""DJ Rib"", I've never heard of any of the tracks here either. Don't be fooled by the cover art or by the title, there are some really great happy hardcore compilations available...this ISN'T one of the them. There is nothing ""essential"" about this collection what so ever."
4,Gurus - 'The Gurus Are Hear!' (Sundazed),"Another compilation of some obscure / never-heard-of band's repertoire put out on the Sundazed label. I actually remember this band, barely. The Gurus are said to be one of THE first bands ever to fuse psychedelia with Middle Eastern sounds. Mission accomplished. I guess The Gurus never put out more than just two 7"" 45's in 1966-67. This seventeen track compilation is their sole full-length release of every tune they ever recorded. It's great for collectors, psych enthusiasts, etc. Tunes here that had me playing this CD over a few times are ""Come Girl"", ""Roads To Nowhere"", the tripping ""Blue Snow Night"", their odd cover of ""Louie Louie"", and the fuzz guitar rocker ""Everyone's Got To Be Alone Sometime"". Might possibly appeal to other unknowns like Misty Wizard, Tea Company, Truth and Mongrels. A nice pick."
2,Cloudy stones and flimsy silver,"Given the price, my expectations were very low. Those expectations were appropriate. Compared to other CZ jewelry we have lying around, these stones are cloudy, and the silver settings were gray and extremely flimsy.The final product does not resemble the Amazon photo."
5,An All-Star Cast Indeed,"This is a digitally re-mastered disc of a very old recording. How old? 1950. The cover and the booklet do not bother to mention whether it is an AAD or ADD disc. Surprisingly, the sound quality is quite good (I mean, much better than expected). It is clean, no noise, what so ever. It is surely an all-star cast recording, with each of the five principals perfectly fitting his or her role. Another surprise is that Karajan even let all the singers ""to sing!"" There are other Figaro recordings consist all stars in the casting. Some even filled the sixth major role (Dr. Bartoro) with someone also a star. However, very seldom you can find a recording that assembles a group of singers like this one. Just listening to these singers in their top form is really worth it. For five stars? Sure. Besides, I don't know how else to rate it."
4,A great book of great tunes from the master.,"This collection (that goes very well with the CD by the same name) provides a great cross section of Clapton's guitar classics. It is a challenging set of music, and could be daunting for the novice. The book provides the full tab for both guitars (some songs use 3), and is a very good resource for getting the intricacies of the second guitar on songs like Cocaine.There are in my opinion only two problems with the book. The first is that the book is standard bound, and if you want it to lay flat you have to split the spine. The second problem is that these songs are more compositions by Clapton, and really require the layering of instruments to come off right. That means that in order to play them (with several exceptions) you need to have bandmates available. If you do, this is a great start to a Clapton cover band."

4,Pet medication simply too expensive,"AS with medication for people in America it has become apparent that companies who produce medical products for animals have also decided to overcharge. For those of us with pets doing without flea killers is unacceptable. I've finally found a site overseas where I can acquire the same medication for my animals at less than half the price I paid here. Sorry American Business Man, you'll simply have to learn that overpricing your product in your homeland will eventually put you out of business. Since the company I will be using is in Australia I believe the problem is American business practices, not an underpaid worker producing product in parts of Asia. How sad that we have succumbed to greed and ignore our own best interests. Lucas Hess"
5,Simply beautiful.,"I absolutely LOVE this music. I have it downloaded only an iPod player in my daughter's nursery. It is the perfect lullaby music for both of us to unwind to at bedtime. We listen to it as I gently rock her to sleep. It is so soothing, as though it fills the room with a calmness. By the third song or so, she is out like a light and I am relaxed after a long day.I would like to stock up on these just to have on hand for every mommy-to-be in my life from here on out."
3,Cracked Case,"The CD came with a cracked case. This was the second time I had order this Cd and wanted to give it as a gift. So I took my case and unscratched cd and gave it to parents of a newborn, and I kept this one."
3,Not Judy Christenberry's best!,"Judy Christenberry knows how to mix humor with romance and she always pulls it off wonderfully.She has had several long going series.The Randalls & the people of Cactus (which has been my favorite)I have waited for Caroline to have her own story sinceRandall Pride.I am a little miffed why there wasn't more interaction between Toby and Caroline as there hab been in Randall Pride.This was just a little thing that bothered me.The story was good, not as much humor as she had in the past.I found it harder to like Caroline than I thought.In a way, she always seemed to be in a bad mood.The fact that he handcuffed her the way he did was unbelieveable.Or that she was always apologizing for not being happy and smiling just bothered me.I have read all of Judy's books.I have also kept them for re-reading.I don't think this is one I will re-read.Then again, you never know."
3,Its OK for under 15 bucks,Pros :-Brand Name : RAPLH LAURENthat Ralph Lauren horse logo on the Shirt.Fabric MaterialCons:-No pocket on Shirt.color not too fancy.Overall :- I am satisfied for getting a Branded Shirt for under 15 bucks !
4,"A collection of Queensryche/Geoff tate from his solo and tribe. Studio tracks, not live","I almost missed this release, not publicized and not initally available in my local record stores. Thanks you amazon. This is a collection of the music of Queensryche and Geoff tate from their short stint with Sanctuary records for tribe and his solo album. These are re-releases of the studio tracks, not live. I had to own it as a ryche fan, but not so big fans, if you happen to have their studio albums, thats probably enough. Otherwise, this does also contain the DVD side with some video, and reportedly some bonus music. I have yet to be successful accessing the bonus stuff, the site just isn't taking my UPC number. So, check it out. Not a must have, but one a ryche fan might like."
3,"nice, if it would rinse!","after all the visible big suds rinses I sat there showering my dog for a solid 5 minutes making sure I got all of this out, and yet when I dried...suds! I do really like the way this stuff smells, and it is moisturizing (not any better than any products though), but it is a huge PITA to rinse! yet another kenic shampoo that let me down :( it's not impossible to make a soap-free shampoo that rinses; tropiclean and earthbath seem to be able to do it."
1,DVI to DVI with RGB out,Product does not work. Will not work with the output of a computer.Someone needs to show that the plugs on this unit are full DVI and does not have the missing pins that come out of a video card. Could not make it work with my TVs or Recorders.There is no documentation and no schematic included with this unit. Buyer beware.
4,"""A"" cast, static production","This production has the ""A"" cast in a very static production conducted by one of the masters. All of the singers are up to their tasks. The sound for the production was recorded separately from the film, and there are times when the unsynchronized lip-synch is very distracting."
2,The problem is the tenor....,"For this recorded performance, Karl Boehm selected the wrong tenor in Rene Kollo. It is not worth the price to pay if you don't have a good Bacchus. James King, who triumphed in the 1976 production in Vienna, with the same cast except Agnes Baltsa for Trudeliese Schmidt as the Composer, was the essence of Bacchus in Boehm's Wiener Staatsoper production which premiered November 20, 1976. I was in the audience, as I was a music student in Vienna at the time. Kollo could never beat King in performance of this role. I am just unbelieving that Boehm would even consider Kollo for this recording over James King. The MET version, with Jessye Norman and Tatiana Troyanos, has King in the cast as well. Suggestion: skip this version to get King's rendition of Bacchus, although Janowitz was truly a great Ariadne as well."
1,"MP3 was of poor quality, not happy",I purchased primo victoria as an mp3 through amazon. I love the song but the mp3 itself was static-y and washed out. Not happy with the results at all.
4,Primo Victoria Review,"Two awesome songs ""Metal Machine"" and ""Into the Fire"". The rest of album is good. It was my first Sabaton CD purchase and I plan on buying more based on this album."
1,"Primo Victoria is very poor quality, static!","Great band and great songs, but for some reason the Primo Victoria MP3 is full of static and sounds terrible. The other MP3's from this album and others came out just fine, so it must be something wrong with that one song."
3,A slight collection of slight riffs about coming of age in communist Czechoslovakia,"I was disappointed by Josef Skvorecky's Headed for the Blues. It is a very spotty and elliptical memoir, and presupposes familiarity with his first two novels (a familiarity I lack). The pained statement about failure (only dishonesty is culpable, not trying and falling short) are moving, but the book does little to explain how this writer came to be the writer he is. The angle of jazz as social protest that lacking words of dissidence is interesting, but there's not much more to say than stating it.There's sex, another pastime for thwarted youth, and impotent outrage arbitrary exercises of state power in the set of related stories (stream-of-consciousness riffs) that don't IMHO add up to a novel. The author and his fictional alter ego are going somewhere (Canada, starging a Czech publishing company there, writing the formidableThe Engineer of Human Souls), but the book and its protagonist mostly spin wheels."
1,Train Wreck,"While the synopsis of the book seems interesting, I am not sure what the book is about. The author uses a ""stream of conscious"" method of stroy telling which few authors could use successfully. Additionally, the story is not divided into chapters, so the stream of thought seems to speed to nowhere.The book is allegedly a memoir of a Czech writer who moved to Canada to start a publishing company. The story is a reflection of his childhood and early life in communist Czechoslavakia. The few entertaining points are concentrated in the dark humor scattered throughout the book. The humor addresses such topics as prostitution and communism.What was it like to live in communism? The answers to these questions are sparse and redundant. Aside from the humor, it is hard to decipher the author's objective. It is a memoir, but even memoir need a story that is going somewhere."
5,Buy this soundtrack!!,I saw this movie TWICE in theaters in November 2006 & in June 2007 in Los Angeles. This is the 1st soundtrack release from this composer. Very cool debut! Limited release of only 1000 copies were made. There is also links on ITunes as well.
4,Brilliant book hey Gov?,"This is an excellent behind the scenes look at the number one British cop series which has been on air for over twenty years now. This book was written in 1999 so a lot of the characters profiled have been killed off but if you watched the show when they were on it you will still learn a lot about them and the actors who played them. Some of the characters are still around today such as Luke Ashton, Reg, Polly, Danny Glaze, Carver, Sgt Boyden, June Ackland and Tony Stamp to name a few.You also get a behind the scenes look at some of the episodes as well as information on how and where The Bill is filmed. Even though it is a bit dated now this is still a must read for any fans of The Bill."
3,Kate returns,"This is the fourth in a series involving Kate Gillespie and her partner, Rocky Markowski. Kate has been assigned to the Cold Case Files. They reopen a case from three years ago. A prostitute had been shot and killed at a sleazy place called the Twin Palms Motel.An informant comes forward who seems to know more about the case than was released to the public. But just as they meet, a bank robbery occurs and the informant disappears. A body show up shortly afterward, but finding out the REAL identity is not an easy task.*** Kate must put herself in the line of fire for answers in this mystery. In fact, she is involved in the mystery more than she knew at first. This mystery is not as good as the previous novels seemed to me, but it is well worth your time to check out. ***Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."
3,Strictly for techno house lovers with no need for vocals,"I thought this was a fairly entertaining mix of predominantly non-vocal tracks. Usually, instrumental mixes bore me, but I could feel the NRG in this one. It's not much of a find for collectors though, as most of the cuts barely run 3 minutes. I would have preferred a full Richie Santana mix CD with some of his own slammin' remixes in their full lengths. He's the reason I bought this disc, and none of his signature stuff (or sound for that matter) was on here. Track times:1. intro (2:37)2. don't laugh (2:23)3. komodo (6:12)4. man alive (1:53)5. the start it up (2:57)6. katerpillar (2:42)7. casa del Diablo (2:03)8. house some more (3:43)9.

5,ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL READING FOR DEAD HEADS,"Of all the authorized and unauthorized Dead tomes, this one is the absolute best I've come across. Concert sets, trivia, history and so much more. A LOT MORE! This is an absolute must for those who weren't around to witness the classic shows or for those of us whose memories that aren't what they used to be..."
3,Are You Dead To The Core ?,"The title actually allready answeres the question if this book should be bought. It is a good read and it is fun to search thru the book (you can always find something interesting), it is full of more or less valid information , the only thing i have to say against this book is that it is questionable how many people are interested in the kind of information that this book provides (taping, quallity of cassetes, etc.)and that it is only apropriate for people who have been deadheads for a long time. So if you are an old deadhad and have miles on the road with the Dead behind, go on and buy the book."
5,Avid Editing book,"I bought this book as an intern for a company who used Avid Media Composer. This is a GREAT book for beginners! I had no prior experience with Avid until my internship, and this book helped me land a job and move up the corporate ladder! I moved from intern to assistant editor to rough cut editor to fine cut editor of a cable television show all in less than 2 years! This book helped a ton! I keep it on a shelf in my editing suite because I still reference it!"
3,"Still Reading and Learning, but...","I am still reading and attempting to learn Avid. I feel confident I will master and improve over time, and I know that I am more than capable (as I have learned to edit on both FCP and PremPro - the latter of which, Mr. Kauffmann, can be used on either a PC or Mac), but loved the idea of using this book in conjunction with the DVD ROM touted as existing on page XXIV in the introduction (and again referenced on pp 419-421).There was no such DVD, and mine was a new copy of the third edition text.What's more, I find it odd that references to the length of the third edition varies wildly from the description of 448pp stated in the desciption to the actual 421pp of the edition in hand.I am encouraged by the comments written by those who purchased and have used this 3rd edition text, but wonder if they were likewise shortchanged on the DVD ROM and the lack of pages?"
5,Essential information for Avid beginners,"I was familiar with editing, but had never used Avid software before. When I installed Avid Express Pro software on my home computer I immediately started a new project. I thought that since I knew editing I would easily figure out the Avid software. Wrong. I muddled through it and finished the project, but it took longer than forever, and I seriously simplified the project because I couldn't figure out many of the functions. This book does a great job of explaining the Avid interface in easy to understand language. The book also included a CD-ROM with practice projects."
5,Extremely valuable content - highly recommended,This book is a must read for the I/T professional.Years of professional expertise have been distilled into this well written and well organized security book. Highly recommended.
4,Taking Hope,"Sometimes just being able to take hope that the one we love so dearly will ""have a chance"" is the greatest gift that can be given. That's where this story told by a mom and her daughter strikes home. It's a short book for a great story. There are no miracles except those that come from hardwork and the grace of life. But that grace is there. The mom give us good links; the daughter gives us insight -- both are invaluable. It's an inspiring story of the good that can be worked by effort and self understanding. The barriers of biology cannot be made to go away -- but they can be climbed over."
2,90% blah ~ 10% WOW!,"Each of these 4 CD's have 2 to 3 really good songs on them, and the rest is stuff that you have never heard before, and will most likely never listen to again. Call me crazy, but I bought this whole set just to get my hands on a copy of ""Captain of her heart"" by Double. This however was the last song on Disc 2, and was cut short. Very disappointing."
5,Beautiful and Relaxing,"This is my favorite from Vince. It is very relaxing. If you want to inspiring music that will sooth and calm you, this is the one to get. I love it and play it frequently."
5,This is the Best Book!,"This is a wonderful book, even for adults. It reminded me of Shel Silverstein's (sp?)writing style. Very enjoyable & good lesson in living ""green"" & recycling."
4,"Finally, pictures and words!",I was so glad to hear this book won the Caldecott award because we so frequently see a book win that has good pictures but a pathetic story. I know that the Caldecott is given for pictures alone but the pictures are greatly complimented by good words. I love this book becasue it teaches a lesson and has truly fun and bright pictures.
4,"clever, but life altering story","i truely enjoyed reading this book because of the lesson it teaches children. this book teaches children to be respecful for what they have, but not to be disappointed for what they dont. It shows how someone can take a favorite object and keep its memory going by making minor changes to it, as in the story, where he took the coat and changed into a jacket and so on. This book is going to be one of the great pieces of children's literature, and one that will be around in classes for ages."
5,Can't go wrong with this book.,This has been a favorite book since the very first time we read it. My six year old daughter was so excited about the book she couldn't wait to share it with her kindergarten class. Needless to say they loved it too.The pictures are brightly captivating and the cut outs are fun.The story also provides a good life lesson about making the best out of what you have.I would recommend this book to everyone with children.
5,Kings of Cocaine: Inside the Medellin Cartel,Very well written. Very informative. I would recommend that everyone buy this book.They'll get a lot out of it.
4,An Inside Look at Drug Trafficking,"The power of the Medellin Cartel is frightening. This is a story of corruption. The overwhelming amount of drug dollars pouring into Colombia contaminated large portions of society. In many ways Colombians lost their moral compass. However, we must never lose sight of the fact that without demand...this is no market for illegal drugs."
4,Multiple perspectives on the Medellin cartel without sacrificing detail.,"A great insight into the overall story of the Medellin Cartel without only emphasizing the one key player, e.g. Pablo Escobar. It also gives a good expose on the machinations of the judicial process in both the USA and Colombia during that time."
4,Love it despite my rating.....,"I have had this bag for several years now and it is like the energizer bunny; it just keeps on going. I travel about 70% of the time and mostly by air. My complaints are general internal workmanship. Mostly with zippers; more specifically with the internal zipper pulls. It could be my fault from packing as I tend to travel a bit heavier than I should, but they broke early on. Exterior pulls and everything else (wheels, handles, etc.) are fine; interior pulls are weak. I have never tried the warranty since there is never enough time between trips. I have a ton of gate check tags so it has seen the underbelly/and bag handling of an airplane extensively and has endured without incident. I will buy another Travelpro Crew when this one kicks the bucket. It fits in the overhead on most larger planes, greater than 50 passenger. BTW, the price I paid on-line was extraordinary; and much better than retail."
1,avoid the bag with fragile handles,"I have used Travelpro products for 10+ years. Unfortunately, that trend will now end due to my experience w/ this bag. I bought this bag from another on-line retailer (LuggageOnline) in April 2007. The second week of use brought the first handle failure. A taxi driver pulled it out of the trunk and the handle snapped. I chalked it up to his possibly treating it roughly. Three weeks ago, though, the second (and last) handle broke. This time, I was handling my luggage, and the handle literally snapped off the bag and the bag did not have much luggage in it. These handles are attached to the bag with plastic. Seems like a major design flaw to me. I don't have the patience or time to deal with repairing the bag, so the ""lifetime warranty"" is useless to me. On to another manufacturer..."
1,not right item,this was NOT the new version of the single that i was under the understanding i was getting. the new version has a new song i dont have yet. this version does not. booo!
4,Pretty boxes,The shipment came out on time and this boxes are very pretty! it was exactly what I was looking for. Of the 12 boxes 2 of them were not finished right they were defective. but I could use the ones I needed. If I was going to give a star rating I will give them a 4 out of 5.
3,"I love the book, hate the books use","I absolutely love this book. Eve Ball did a great job on telling the stories as direct as she could from the Chiricahua's. I got the book super fast and the outside wear of it is great but once I wanted to read the book someone had wrote all over in it. You can't even understand what you're reading most of the time because there's scribbles all over. I believe a book that came in that condition should've been 50 cents plus regular s&h. I had to buy a giant pack of erasers just to go through all the pages to actually read the book. I would never buy a book from this seller again. The book is not 99.7% great, it was about 65% I'd say."
4,return of a master,"I think this is a very enjoyable CD. The songwriting, arrangements, and everybody's playing are great. Even if some of his technical chops from earlier days are missing. I would recommend it."
3,"Should be titled ""A Tribute to Freddie Hubbard""","This is a solid jazz album of Hubbard Standards, played vibrantly by the New Jazz Composers Octet. It is a loving, proper tribute to the music that put Freddie Hubbard on the map. Freddie, however, is so far down in the mix that his presence is minimal on this disc. He has, reportedly, faced lip and stamina problems in later years, and unfortunately this has tarnished his reputation as one of the incredible jazz talents from Indianapolis: Wes Montgomery, the late J.J. Johnson, Slide Hampton and Freddie Hubbard (and the list continues). For Hubbard fans, it is good to have just to keep up with Freddie, but I would have to advise new listeners to go back to early Hubbard recordings and hear Freddie at his prime."
2,Only for True Freddie Fans,"I was very excited to hear Freddie's new Cd. Obviously my expectations were low due to his chop problems. The arrangments on his tunes are nice and there are some good solos from the other artists. Freddie, on the other hand, is going through the battle of his life. His solos are brief and are nothing compared to his earlier recordings. I'm a huge Freddy fan. It saddens me to hear the level of his playing. Hopefully he'll be able to turn it around. This Cd is for true Freddy fans who collect all his recordings."
3,"Applaud this effort, pray for better days","I saw Freddie in the fall of 2000. He appeared with the late Stanley Turrentine, in one of Stanley's final gigs. Freddie was in terrible shape, his lip problem rendered him unable to play. I am not sure when this album was recorded. While nothing like the playing of his prime, Freddie puts in a solid effort here despite his limitations."
2,Unfortunate...,"I was excited about this album when it was released. Freddie Hubbard has been my favorite trumpet player for years, and new material from him seemed to be a god send. I chose not to listen to the people warning me about his serious chop issues, and his bout with cancer. Instead I looked back fondly on his earlier recordings, thinking what it would be like to have another masterpiece in my collection. Unfortunately, I was much too hopeful. While the horn arrangements are absolutely brilliant, Freddie is a shadow of his former self. His tone is weak, and he sounds shakey throughout the range of the horn. He sounds more like a bad Freddie Hubbard impersonator rather than the virtuosic master that he used to be. If he could climb back to the level he was at before his chop disaster, it would be a true benefit to society. Much to my chagrin, this album does not accomplish this feat."
3,I Stand All Amazed,It gave added insight into the meaning of life and death. It is a subject we need to learn as much about as possible. The book was very enlightening and enjoyable reading. It gave us added understanding on why we go through some of the things we do.
5,Eye opener,"Life is a test. If God's hand in our affairs was obvious, it wouldn't be a test. You still have to have faith, but this book comes very close to revealing the surety of God's existence, His plan for us His children, and the validity of the holy scriptures by giving a glimpse of life after mortality."
2,"To expensive..but, ok","I used this product. But, after awhile I got tired of taking so many vitamins. Instead I am using EFA from swanson health vitamins. They have a website. I take a hair, skin, and nails supplement, and two tbsp of EFA everyday. I would continue buying this, but it was to many pills and the price is crazy. You can go online and find better deals for supplements."
4,Popular in Rural Areas,"I see this bumper sticker in the country often. Where I work hunting is so popular that it seems like at least 20% of the plant is on vacation at least part of the time during hunting season. It is amazing how many vehicles, mostly trucks, sport this bumper sticker. How else can you afford to feed your hunting dog!"
4,great for dog lovers,This is a wonderful book with questions about dogs listed on each page. After the statement it ask true or false. Then it goes on to tell you the answer. You will learn the answer to questions like Do dogs hear more than people do? Did ancient Egyptians breed dogs as well as cats? Do dogs see what we see?The book might have been more interesting to dog lovers if it included real photographs of real dogs instead of paintned ones. It was still a neat book with lots of cool facts on dogs.We would recommed this book to all dog lovers. This is a fun and educational way to learn more about your pet.
5,Help and Hope for the Hurting,"Enduring the death of two sons, the serious illiness of her husband, and the announcement by the third son that he was homosexual, Barbara Johnson managed to find a way to deal with everything and end up happy. In my opinion, she's earned the right to give advice, and she even makes you smile while she's doing it. Often, she says, you go through the stages of churning, burning, yearning, turning, and finally learning to live again, as you handle immense pain. I loved this book, and have bought copies for others. It's a must-read."
5,Barbara Johnson is hilarious!!,"Wow, Barbara Johnson is extremely hilarious and down to earth. She teaches us how not to take problems so seriously and to stop asking ""Why"". She is a woman of great faith and has gone through alot and come a long way in life. If you are going through a tough journey in life right now this book will help you to put everything into prospective and will remind you that God is always in control."
2,"Good humor, but some unchristian-like thoughts","Although humorous and witty content; I was disturbed that any Christian woman, and mother, could wish her son dead. I do not agree with her views on homosexuality."
2,Looks over function,Beautiful but poorly designed teapot. The lid sits too high and has a rim that is too narrow to keep it in the top of the teapot - you have to hold it while you pour or risk it falling out. Ok if you only want it for decoration.
2,not the cd you think it is,"this is the score from the movie, not a soundtrack of the songs from the movie. A big mistake on the part of the record company, as Monkey Bone has one of the best soundtracks of the year."
3,missing song?,"i nkow this soundtrack was meant to only contain the ochestral songs from monkeybone, but it would have made much better listening if it contained some of the other songs heard in the film. for example, the cool pop/rock song at the end which i cant seem to find the name of. it sounds like the main words in the chorus are ""some other world"". whats it called and who's it by?"
3,could've been more,"the score is good, but this cd wouldve been better if they would have thrown in some of the songs. I would have loved to get whatever song was playing during the scene where monkeybone is dreaming on the golf course and hpnos interrupts him. Also not to be missed was Brendan Fraser singing Brickhouse. They missed some great opportunities with this cd."
3,"pleasant, not passionate","LOT OF FOLKS LIKE MR.O'NEIL'S WORK AS REPRESENTED IN ""LOVE ALWAYS"", BUT HE DOESN'T MATCH THE PASSION AND VARIETY OF A BATEMAN, THE INDIVIDUALITY OF A WINSTON, OR THE CREATIVITY OF A CIANI. GOOD PRESENT FOR YOUR IN-LAWS OR MINISTER(NO RISK)....have a good one! chuck"
3,Love the design,"I ordered this for my teen. She loves it, but it's not big enough to hold her school books. A bit of a let-down, but she hated the backpack design. I guess you could say she likes it alot, but it's not functional how we had hoped."
3,my daughter loves it,"I purchaseed the sailor moon book bag because my daughter is a fan to this character,So I bought it for her and she loves it,If you have a son or daughter and they wish to have it,then I would suggest this item. darrel"
2,counterfeit!,"a bad counterfeit bag! don't buy! on the front you can see that under sailor mars it says ""sailor jupiter"" with the jupiter logo and vice versa."
5,Great Philosophy and math connections...,"excellent resource for 7-12th grade. Units are designed to meet new MST standards by encouraging students to read and discuss mathematical topics and ideas. As a mathematics teacher with a BS/MA in math, and a strong philosophy background I loved it. If you are looking for a way to connect math to life this is it. Great book."
2,Not surprised at the problem,"It seems funny to me that the previous reviewer would accuse someone of working for the competition, just because they had a less than wonderful experience. I would think the company would welcome the chance to know they mishandled a customer and try right the wrong and improve their service. Maybe blaming the customer for needing help is the way they look at things, but all I see is a wasted chance to make someone want to return and do more business. By the way, I wonder what company our second reviewer for works for ??"
3,Fisher Scientific,"The catalog is very thorough and very useful. The images are very clear. However, the navigation is very difficult. (i.e.- when I tried to go to page 20C, I ended up at page 20). Because of the layout of this catalog and the navigation issues, I would recommend getting the paper catalog and using it."
3,Trillion - self-titled (Sony) 3 1/2 stars,"Originally saw the light of day in 1978, as this was the progressive arena rock band's first of two lp's. Kept hearing how critics and their label was expecting Trillion to become 'the next Boston'. Of course, this never happened. That's too bad because I sort of liked this long out-of-print album. Some of the tracks off this semi-over looked gem I remember the most were the catchy ""Hold On"", ""May As Well Go"" and the well written ""Hand It To The Wind"". Line-up: Dennis Frederickson-vocals & bells, Frank Barbalace-guitar & vocals, Ron Anaman-bass & vocals, Patrick Leonard-keyboards and Bill Wilkens-drums. If you like '70's bands such as Foreigner, Styx, Toto, Journey and Kansas then you might want to hunt down a copy of this co$tly import CD reissue. My only regret is a year after this record came out, Trillion played a low-dough show at a club in my hometown and I missed it. Assume they disbanded soon there after."
3,First round,"I'm listening to it for the first time, (on vinyl which I just found today) right now. I'll get back with you."
5,HIP + Freedom = Art,"To me, this is, and will always be, the best recording ever of these works: the matching of a Historically Informed Performance (HIP) with the freedom of one of the greatest XX century artists makes for a unique look that can't be matched by anything else.Too bad this is out of print now. If you can find a copy somewhere, GET IT!"
3,Helpful but not typical 10-key layout,"I bought this one because it wasn't wireless. It works fine but the issue for me is I'm a pretty speedy 10-key typist and the top right key is a backspace which is where the dash is normally. Instead, the dash is below the backspace key. I find myself having to consciously think about where each is and then I backspace often when I meant to hit the dash. It seems minor, but the whole point to a 10-key attachment is to speed up your typing on a laptop. It's helped me, but it's not ideal. At this point, I'm not going to hassle with returning it, but wouldn't buy another."
3,Great numeric keypad.. not really well-suited to MAC,"I had all kinds of agony getting this thing to work with my Macbook Pro. Finally, I did a reboot with the keypad attached, and everything seems to work (except the numlock lamp will not light). This is a great keypad, but it was advertised as being MAC-compatible, and I am not sure that is quite accurate. Customer support didn't seem to have much of a clue about Mac compatibility."
3,"Num Lock is in your PC, not this device","I purchased this intending to use it with a USB keyboard with touchpad, thinking that adding this device would make up for the loss of my full-size keyboard with number pad.Did not realize until I installed it that the Num Lock button on this keypad also activates the Num Lock on my separate USB keyboard (which changes the letter keys under the right hand into number keys on that keyboard). Turning Num Lock on and off on that keyboard likewise turns it on and off on this keypad. Seems like Num Lock is actually some sort of switch internal to the PC (I never knew that before), rather than being restricted to each individual device (which would make more sense to me).This may not be a problem for you, but for me, it made the combo unworkable."
1,Mac Users,"Even though the Micro Connectors website said this was Apple compliant, it did not work on my MacBook Pro. I sent it back."
4,OH REBBIE!!!,"I ADMIT THAT I WAS QUITE RELUCTANT WHEN I BOUGHT THIS CD, BUT I AM GLAD THAT I DID. REBBIE HAS TO BE THE ONLY JACKSON WITH A WIDE VOCAL RANGE. HER VOICE IS MUCH STRONGER THAT HER FAMOUS SIBLINGS. DON'T GET ME WRONG, I LOVE JANET, BUT REBBIE IS A FAR BETTER TALENTED SINGER. JUST LISTEN TO CENTIPEDE AND HER VOICE SAYS IT ALL. I DO WISH HOWEVER THAT SHE GETS MORE UPTEMPO BEATS BECAUSE THE GIRL IS ""DA BOMB""!!!!!"
3,Three and-a-half stars...Rebbie's duet with Robin Zander during Cheap Trick's The Doctor days is a missing cut and video!,"Rebbie is actually the best of theJacksons and has more vocal range.Reaction is no longer available, sohere is what we have to get to getthe fine single 'You Send the RainAway'. Solid LP. I recommend it!"
3,Not all 2 strokes,This is not a book for the average mechanic it has advanced mods for 2 stroke engines. I would also say that a lot of the book does not partain to all 2 stroke engines. It has an excellent carburation section. Overall for me I do not think it was worth the money to me.
3,Nice buy for the price I buyed !,"This Book is nice, the beging is a introduction about differents styles from diferents photographers and the rest a few information about real techniques of glamour photography and lighting"
1,Wish Hard Enough And Maybe ...,"Based upon the other reviews, I was very hopeful that this would be a good product. However, I have tried it in the fireplace (ash odor), basement (musty odor), son's dorm room (who knows what that odor is), trash bin (old garbage odor) and generally around the house. I cannot tell a difference.Washed it thoroughly before use according to directions. Kept the water level filled and ... nothing. Odors persist where they were difficult before.If you read the instructions, descriptions and reviews, you will notice a common thread: you must wait many hours for it to work. I think that what is happpening when people report that it ""works"" is that these odors dissipate on their own in that time. One reviewer even pointed out that if you place the SmellKiller, wait and open the windows, in a short time the odor is gone. I suspect that opening the windows is what did it, not the SmellKiller.If it seems too good to be true ...you know the rest."
1,Doesn't work at all! The seller won't even accept return because I have tried it!,"I purchased this based on some of the reviews because I got a kitten and want to get rid of the cat litter smell. It doesn't do a thing!I did everything right and the seller won't allow me to return it because I have tried it and it is now ""in used condition and can not be resold"". How am I supposed to know that it doesn't work when I am not allowed to try it first? I did everything right: used tap water, wash the unit before putting in water, used it in a room smaller than 150 square ft, kept the dish fill with water but not to cover the unit. It just doesn't work! Don't be fooled by some of the reviews!!!!!! A total waste of money!"
3,It works...,"But not as well as I hoped. With the heat of the summer it seemed that I had to fill the tray several times a day, and since it was so hot inside and out it didn't seem to work as well as when I first purchased it."
5,Deodorize,This product really works. It takes the cooking odors out of my kitchen within a short time. Hard to believe such a simple device can be so effective.
5,Works Great,Very pleased with item. I have 2 cats and this item removes any smell from them or their litterbox.
5,The name speaks for itself !!,The Smell Killer absolutely is a smell killer. I bought two for my apartment to try to get rid of smoking odors. Absolutely fantastic. The BEST item I have seen or heard of for eliminating unpleasant odors. I highly recommend the Smell Killer.
4,Very Pleased!,"I recieved this product fairly quickly, and was really happy with it! Nice, opaque color pay off. Smooth application. But the color is more hot pink than it looks. I expected more of an orangy pink than a neon pink. Deborah Lippman nail polish is fun to collect too!"
5,"Prelude to A Kiss: My ""Go-To"" Polish","All Lippmann polishes are great for durability and ease of application - the shorter brush provides a lot a extra control. As a very pale blonde with red undertones in my skin, this is the most neutral polish I've found - and I I think I've tried them all. One coat is fine for a totally clean but sheer look, while two coats provides opaque coverage without looking cakey."
4,Great color! So-so polish.,"I was excited to try Deborah Lippman polish, as she seems to have colors that no one else does. This was one of those colors - it's like Vamp only a little more red, and SO SATURATED in color. It is truly unique, hard to appreciate via an internet picture. However, the quality of her polish is only so-so. Quite frankly, I find that OPI and Sally Hansen have polishes that wear much longer (and I know how to prolong a manicure), which is disappointing considering how expensive Lippman products are. Perhaps having such super-saturated colors impacts the polish and makes it chip easily? I am glad I was able to purchase this product at a discount through Amazon's network of sellers. That being said, I would give this color six stars if I could."
4,Deborah Lippmann Ridge Filler Base,"It works okay but I think it a little expensive for the results I got, since this is the first product I have used I really can't compare, still expensive I think."
3,More Glitter!,"I received this polish for Christmas and was so excited to try it. I pulled the brush out of the bottle and all I saw was a very dark blue polish that had almost no glitter in it. The glitter was all stuck to the sides. I hoped that if I kept shaking the bottle long enough, that the glitter would come off the sides. But, it never worked. The picture is deceiving to me.-YET, it was very smooth when you put it on and dried nicely. It just needs more glitter!"
5,BEAUTIFUL! Bad Romance,This is my first Deborah Lippmann nail polish but oh my gosh I love this sooooo much. It is super duper beautiful. The only problem that I have with this polish is that it is kind of hard to get off. But that is kind of what happens with glitter polish.
3,Not worth it.,"I had been eyeing this polish for a long time, but was always put off because of the price. So finally I just decided to get it. I really do love the color, and the uniqueness of this polish, I've never really seen anything like it. It is a little difficult to apply, and it takes about 3-4 coats for it to be completely opaque on the nails. I'd recommend wearing it over a black or dark blue polish instead. The lasting power is HORRIBLE, it was chipping pretty bad after only one day. For $20 I expected the lasting power to be at least as good as my other polishes, but it wasn't."
2,Hello Ty Goodbye,"It's a terrible feeling waiting for your package to finally arrive in the mail and opening up your shiny, new package to see it clearly falling apart. The polish comes packaged in a black DL bag, white stitching seams falling out, with 4 compartmentalized zippers, one of which, on mine, is broken. The seams are tearing and the zipper is missing. Moving forward, I don't have a lot of faith in the quality of this DL polish itself. I wont be surprised if it's dried out and old."
1,not what it sounds like,This describes polish remover as being a mitt which I assumed was like for the whole hand to soak in. It's one little finger mitt and does not remove polish.
2,wicked light,I purchased this nail polish because I watched an interview on Martha Stewart with the designer. The color appears a irredescent grey in the bottle is not grey at all whey applied. More like a sheer purplish pink.
5,Worth Every Penny,"This polish is amazing!!! I don't care about dupes; since I rarely if ever spend this much on polish it was worth the $18 splurge. It's already in a dark jelly but I put 2 coats of ATU over 1 coat of L'Oreal's After Hours (deep indigo) & I am completely in love. Topped it off with a coat of Nubar 3-free fast dry shiny top coat. I wouldn't ordinarily wear a dark polish in the summer but wearing this is a beautiful exception. Gorgeous twinkling in light, awesome contrast to the dark blue base."
3,"Pretty, but peels off after just a day","I was hoping I would not need 3 layers of this polish to get the full effect of the look-it DOES look great after the 3 coats AND a good, shiny top coat. Mine did peel off in chucks but he next day, however. :-(. Maybe a good look for an evening out-that's about it."
5,Best Nail Polish I Have Ever Used!,"This is the best nail polish I have ever used! It does not smear or chip, and it is long lasting. The color is fabulous! I cannot wait to try other colors from Deborah Lippmann! My best friend recommended the Deborah Lippman brand to me. I shall be eternally greatful for her advice and recommendation. Thank you CWOW!"
5,My Favorite Nail Polish Ever,"*****This is my favorite nail polish ever. It goes over most any color or just over your plain nails. It is clear polish with chunky, unstructured multi-colored glitter--so it's all different sizes. It can be blingy if you use several coats. It can be even nicer if you just use one coat, as the glitter is fun and random and it's not as flashy. I love it any way at all. I vary the look depending upon my mood.It can go over any color except something that is gold or with golden tones, because it has silver chunks that wouldn't match as well. It is described as ""a party on your hands"" by Deborah Lippmann and I have to say that this is what it is for me--fun to look at, playful, gorgeous. I get compliments on it all the time.Deborah Lippmann products are very expensive and worth it. When you think about how long they last in the bottle and on your hands, you are actually saving money. It's just a big outlay at first (again, worth it!).Highly recommended.*****"
3,Not super effective,I was tired of using the traditional remover products which are so ineffective. This product is definitely beats the traditional product but it still took me 2 mitts to get it all off from my toe nails. I dont think it will work out for me price wise.
2,misleading color,I was choosing a light pink and got a taupe color. same name but not at all what I wanted
5,Can't believe it was worth $18,"I really liked this color otherwise I never would have spent this much on nail polish, especially online. But it turns out that it lasts three times as long as any other glitter polish I have tried. I got tons of compliments on it. I probably won't make it a habit to spend this much on nail polish, but I'm happy with my purchase."
4,color,"I was unable to tell from the picture but this polish is in a black base. Very dark. I was expecting it to be in a purple base like the ""across the universe"" but still very satisfied. These polishes are very sparkly and take some getting used to when applying."
4,Loving Daytripper!,I have been using the color Daytripper for about a month now and I have to say that I just love this color. It is my go-to-color for the summer 2012 season. It matches just about anything I wear. I also think this will look good into the fall season. I do want to point out that the picture isn't anywhere near the color this actually is. This color is more of a pinky orange color.It is a little tricky to put on and at least a couple of coats is needed to get the desired color that I was aiming for. It sure didn't let me down when I got there. I also really like the creme look. I put on a base coat. Two to three coats of Daytripper and a top coat and I'm ready to go.I would highly recommend this color to everyone and if you decide to try it I sure hope you love the color as much as I do.
3,Could not use even though it DOES fill ridges...,"This polish coat does indeed fill nail ridges as promised. What is not mentioned is that the polish is opaque and is a weird pinkish clay color that, at least to my taste, needs to be covered with a colored polish; I happen to use clear polish. Did make a return for that reason."
5,d. lippmann polish,"nice product, wrapped well. good service. thank you very much. color nice light sheer pink. I put a glitter polish over top to spice it up a bit."
3,"Good, but not great","My wife liked this at first because it was different, but there are other products that give a much better shine and sparkle. Maybe it was just the color choice that was off? Either way, it made her go out and experiment with getting similar results on her own."
4,Great!,"I am happy I bought this nail filer. It works very well and it very sturdy and flexible. My only complaint is that is can tear up a little more easily than I would like for 12.00, but it doesn't affect the use, just probably the longevity."
2,"Great polish, not so great price.","While it's true that DL polishes may be worth the investment, akin to Butter London, RBL and other high end polishes, this one isn't worth the money. Multi-colored glitter suspended in clear, there is a very cheap duplicate out there that no one really realizes is almost a dead ringer. The glitter from Milani's Jewel FX line called 'gems' is 99% the same thing, the only difference is Happy Birthday contains square glitter (the smaller glitter) and Gems is all hex glitter. You can BARELY tell the difference unless you take a close macro shot of them side by side. At least its comparable to the old formula before DL changed the coloration of Happy Birthday to a more pinkish tone. Seek out gems before you drop big bucks on this DL shade, buy the dupe and save your money for another DL polish that isn't easy to copy."
1,Company Unresponsive,"I placed an order on Oct. 4th 2010 and was contacted by Amazon on Oct. 11th stating they hadn't received any update from Koonichi, Inc. After following Amazon's suggestion of emailing the Company on Oct. 11th, it's now Oct. 29th and still nothing! DO NOT ORDER PRODUCTS FROM THIS UNRESPONSIVE COMPANY!!!!!"
3,Rarities collected,"This could be very interesting collection - Talk Talk was like chameleon,transisting from new wave pop band to ambitious rock formation up to relaxing ambient collective. Well - the fact is that many track are really valuable and rare such as never published elswhere on Cd poppy ""strike up the band"", rocking ""Pictures of bernardette"" or ""?"" and a lot of demos and remixes. but most of track shows us why they were b-sides - they are simply simple,quite boring,uninspiring second class synth pop.I like tal talk but this collection is mostly for their biggest fans,offering a lot of treasures that are that valuable mostly because they were not published on cd befor. But the real gem here is ""john cope"" (can be found on some one best of collection) - atmospheric and catchy ""spirit of eden"" outtake that could be a great single hit.but for all - 3 stars"
2,Nothing new,"This is an item for collectors. You won't find anything worth listening to, except for 2 tracks. Better buy the original albums."
1,Not worth it,This FM Transmitter has a humming sound with or without music playing on it. The transmitter is weak. In a major city there is no chance of being able to hear you music. I bought two of these. In a Jeep Grand Cherokee with a Sony head unit the radio won't even pick up the signal over those being broadcasted in the city. In a Hyundai Elantra with a panasonic head unit the signal is being picked up but the humming sounds is too frustrating to listen to music over. A friend of mine has a Monster series charger and transmitter. His sounds 1000x better. Don't waste your money on this. Spend the extra $20 and get a product you'll be happy with.
1,Charger Is Too Big,Not sure if it needs an adapter or what...But it won't fit in my car's (oldsmobile alero) cigarette lighter nor will it fit my aux. power outlet. I tried it in my friend's car (2006 Toyota Avalon) and it won't fit in there either. Not sure whats up with this product.
1,Junk,"The only thing this item is good for is charging your ipod. The transmitter is so weak all you hear is static buzz with muffled music in the background. Don't waste your money. And, don't expect any help from the manufacturer who refuses to answer emails or accept a warranty return."
4,Excellent feminist approach to abuse,"Great selection in a field dominated by 'how to heal/move forward', but without any women's history/feminist theory. Older survivor's of childhood sexual abuse may especially appreciate this as we lived through the women's movement. I am exploring this field for the first time, and I think survivors need to ready many, many kinds of these books, but this one has to be included. It's a terrific balance and brings up male privilege in a way others do not."
4,Good price; good furniture,"We were happy with the delivery of the furniture. It went together fairly easily, except we had to drill a couple of holes for the screws as they were not completed at the factory. Other than that, we feel it was a fair deal for the price."
3,Alternatives,"This book isn't that bad. Unfortunately, the author's lack of writing skills mask the quality of his work."
5,Beat-those-squirrels bird feeder,"Best squirrel-can't-get-to-it bird feeder I've tried. It's fun watching them try, try again, and still fail. It's attractive to boot. Nice job."
2,Wasteful,"It's too easy for the seed to be pulled out of the orifices; one bird can lower the feed level by an inch an hour simply by causing seed to fall to the ground, defeating purpose of feeder to prevent rodents or large unwanted birds from feeding. Very disappointed in performance and I can't recommend.Perhaps if the openings were smaller, the waste would not occur?"
1,Worst feeder we've ever owned,"Starlings love this feeder and the cardinals do not. We bought to keep the Starlings away, but they had no problem feeding and the Cardinals had nothing to do with it."
1,NOT SQUIRREL PROOF,"Just got this feeder after persistent squirrel eating all my finch food out of finch feeder. Well when he jumps on this feeder, it doesn't close the openings so he is busy licking the , the finches sit around and watch waiting for him to get chased off by me. VERY disappointed and will return this for refund."
1,Thumbs down,"This birdfeeder was a waste of money. Sure, squirrels can't get the food, but neither can the birds. The design is just plain bad. I hung this thing up with premium bird seed, the birds are unable to find the pinholes (and they are) to eat from. Don't waste your money on this birdfeeder."
5,Squirrel proof feeder,"We have finally found the right squirrel proof feeder. For years we have been fighting with them to stay off the feeders, and never thought we would find a solution. We have tried vasoline on pole, Hot red pepper, baffles, and on and on........yes, the squirrels investigated; but after a few days, they gave up. We love the feeder and it is made well and worth the purchase."
5,Fantastic Bird feeder,This bird feed definitely keeps the squirrels off. It was fun to watch them try when we first hung it and could not get any seed to come out. Now the doves and squirrels eat from the ground underneath the feeder. I would highly recommend if squirrels are a problem.
3,"It is squirrel proof, but the birds don't like it","It definitely is squirrel proof but so far, not many birds like this feeder. They much prefer the larger Brome feeder and the cheaper tube feeders and hoppers. It is a well made feeder but the hanger cable is much to flexible. It needs to be rigid in order to hang the feeder high above head height."
3,not great...but pretty good,"generally does the job of keeping squirrels from eating the seed, but the perches are a little flimsy & the weight of a determined squirrel can bend them down."
5,Bird Magnet,One of my bird feeders was constructed like a house with a porch in front and back. Birds trampling around on the porches were causing much of the seed to fall to the ground. I have had success with other Brome feeders so I decided to purchase the 1015 as a replacement. This is a superb feeder. Filling it is a simple and easy process. As soon as I filled it and hung it the birds headed for it just as soon as I walked away. The design of the feeder prevents excessive feed loss and also protects the feed from inclement weather. Squirrels hate the feeder because they cannot raid its contents. This is a great feeder and highly recommended.
5,Very good bird feeder,"Attracts all bird types and has kept the squirrels out, for the most part. Squirrels can hang on and shake out a few seeds. Very study construction. Holds a lot of seeds so no need to re-fill as often."
5,Frustrated squirrels tidy up deck,"Very impressive product. Easy to refill and a lovely design for both perching and clinging birds. Squirrels are no match for this design. Though frustrated that they can't get at the bird food, they do a decent job of picking up the scrapes that fall to the deck. Very pleased."
5,Brome bird feeder,Bird feeder arrived quickly and in perfect condition. All I can say is that the birds and I are very happy! Thank you!
4,Really works,"This is truly a squirrel proof feeder. I have two of these. Only complaint is that the spring mechanism broke on one of them while cleaning and it's toast. Just treat it gently when cleaning. I am getting another one since it's the only feeder I have seen that keeps squirrels off. As for the critters swinging the feeder around to disperse seeds, this is a very small ""squirrel tax"" to pay. Put some seed on the ground for our bushy tailed friends and be thankful they are not ON the feeder."
4,Defeat those pesky squirrels,"This product is great. Without hurting the squirrels, except mentally, it prevents them from robbing birdseed from the birds, while allowing most birds to continue feeding. I don't know about the rest of you, but I have found squirrels to be pretty clever at getting around most barriers, but this device works just as advertised. After two or three failed attempts to get seeds out of it, the squirrels have stopped trying. Surprisingly, we even get woodpeckers taking sunflower seeds from this feeder."
5,Love it no more squirrels or raccoons on my feeder,I bought this feeder with my doubts but was told it really works. I live in t country with a lot of woods many squirrels and raccoons in my yard. This feeder is the real deal not only have the squirrels stopped getting on the feeder no more raccoons at night. I highly recommend this feeder and the larger one. I have both of them. I am happy to see that my song birds are enjoying their seed without being pushed away by other intruders. And also I am spending a lot less money on bird seed.
5,Birds love it,"This is a very well designed tube style bird feeder. It does exactly what it is designed to do. The smaller birds are able to perch on the built on perches and their lack of table manners allows food to fall to the ground for the larger birds to collect. It is great fun watching them flock to the feeder within moments of filling it. It is very sturdily build with just the right amount of spring loading to close if a squirrel should climb on it. Of course, they don't because I have a squirrel feeder on the tree close by."
2,Songbirds won't go near this one,"I must say I am stumped over why the local songbirds won't use this feeder. Previously we had a copper feeder that had a saucer base in addition to perches. The local small birds liked it, but the mourning doves loved it and we got tired of feeding the bigger birds - they'd eat the feed up in a day or two. So we switched to this feeder. Same feed. Same location. After 2 weeks it is still nearly full. True, the doves can't use it, but for whatever reason the songbirds just don't like it. So, we cannot recommend it, in spite of others' good reviews (which is why we bought it in the first place). Too bad, and it wasn't cheap, either."
5,No more feeding the squirrels,"Works perfect. We were filling our previous feeder at least once a week as it was attacked by numerous squirrels within a day of filling it. Now, the squirrels are left for forage on the ground only as the caging around the perches is perfect to keep them away from the seed. Our birds have no problem getting at the food, even the Cardinals are able to perch on the feeder and eat. You fill the feeder by twisting and pulling the top off. It has been out all winter and no signs of wear or tear or even rust! Impressive feeder!"
3,Not deer and raccoon proof!,"Deer can snake their tongues in and clean it out fast. Raccoons worked the lid off and eventually chewed the plastic core in half making the feeder totally unusable. I will get another, hang it higher, and bring it in at night because it did keep the squirrels out."
4,It Works,"Alright, No need to go beyond what I experienced personally with a fat squirrel who obviously had a lot of experience with bird feeders. Happening upon my newly installed ""Squirrel Buster"" feeder, he approached it with great expectations and no hesitation. Starting from the top, he put his whole weight on the feeder, BAM, it lowered, closing off access to the feeder ports. He was left swinging wildly until he got either dizzy or tired and dropped to the ground. It now has been over a week and I have not seen him since. Yes, it works!!"
5,One tough bird feeder!,"We have a lot of critters in our backyard so when I found this and read the reviews, it made sense to give it a try. Not only is it squirrel proof but it can also withstand rough treatment from rogue raccoons! Yes, those furry little guys detached it from the tree, emptied it out and carried it down to the creek where it lay submerged for several days. Cleaned it out and it is as good as new! Highly recommended-I now have it locked to the tree branch and no more problems from raccoons!"
4,Not 100%,"The squirrels are basically defeated from hanging on this to eat the bird seed. However, in a very short time, the bolt at the bottom has fallen off and been lost--due to all their attempts?But, overall, it was what I needed and wanted."
5,Squirrels are discouraged,"This bird feeder has discouraged the squirrels from getting the food. They do jump on it but soon discover, they cannot get any of the food and they jump off. The feeder is well made I just wish it had more perches for the birds. So far, I'm very pleased and not wasting so much food."
4,Vanishing Species...Thank Goodness,"I watched the video, examined the design, could not find the flaw, but I was sure there would be one. I have been feeding birds for 20 years, mostly sparrows and finches, and I have been involuntarily turning at least half the seeds over to the neighborhood tree-rats, AKA squirrels. The squirrels actually broke my last two feeders. I was completely cynical regarding the ability of any feeder to fend off the athletic and resolute rodent thieves.I cheerfully admit my folly. The Brome Squirrel Buster has so frustrated them, that I have hardly seen a squirrel anywhere in my trees for weeks. That has cut back on the number of times I have to fill it, yet the songbirds swarm around it and munch merrily every day."
2,Broke After Seven Months,Worked great until last night. Now the outside cage is in the down position preventing the birds from feeding. Something broke somewhere so there's no spring action keeping the outside cage in the up position.
4,Keeps pilfering to a minimum,My squirrels are fat from the seed they stole from my old feeders so I can hear the gates snap shut when they climb on this feeder. They're not able to eat from it and they're not spilling much. At least not yet. They're persistent so I'll have to see if they come up with new strategies.
4,Really busted,I purchased the Squirrel Buster Classic along with the Squirrel Buster Plus and they both work great. I'm pretty sure they have both paid for themselves in the money saved on birdseed.
5,Happy with my choice of feeders,"I bought a Squirrel Buster Plus two years ago. Based on the quality and performace of that feeder, I decided to buy the smaller Squirrel Buster Classic. Both feeders are sturdy, well designed, easy to clean and so far squirrel proof (ever underestimate the inginuity of a squirrel). It is also sanitary, as the birds do not stand in their food and mix their droppings with it. What more could a feeder do? It is well worth the price."
5,Keeps the squirrels out!,"This is an excellent feeder and keeps the squirrels out. The plastic is heavier than a lot of cylinder feeders I've seen, which is good, since the squirrels in my area are pretty strong, and I've seen them rip the plastic collar and perch around other feeder holes right off. In theory, with this feeder, they shouldn't even be able to get to the hole, but you never know! For filling, the top is easy to open (but not easy enough that a squirrel could open it). Filling gets a little messy, since I'm trying to fill a cylinder with a coffee can full of seed, so I'm going to get a funnel to help with that. I've only seen smaller birds (finches, chickadees, sparrows, nuthatches) at it so far. I'm hoping for some cardinals, but none yet -- at least when I've been watching. (I don't really want to pay the added expense of the version with the cardinal ring.) If I were to get another cylinder squirrel-proof feeder, I would definitely buy this one again."
5,Brome bird feeder,"This is my second Squirrel Buster Feeder & it is great. so far the squirrels have not had any success getting into it & believe me, they tried. we have had our first one for 10 years & it looks brand new. I would certainly recommend these feeders."
5,Squirrel from Amazon busts squirrels and grackles,"Our new squirrel buster does more than advertised! Grackles, blue jays, and crows leave it in disgust! My small songbirds are happy and no one else is eating their food. It will do wonders for my bird seed bill, too. It is great to find a product that does more good things than advertised!!! Good job Amazon!"
3,Squirrel Buster? not really,"Problem just as much with the placement of the feeder though. Cunning little #@!devil, just pulled it toward them & feasted! I moved it to a metal pole with better outcome"
5,Best on the Market,"I live in a very wooded area that is replete with squirrels and have tried many products to discourage them from eating at my bird feeders. I have used this feeder for two years, and not one has gotten past it. In my experience, this one works and works every time."
5,Excellent product.,Squirrels gave up trying to get seeds out of the feeder after 2 weeks of trying. The perches are good for smaller birds like finches.
3,not for the casual reader,"If you get through the first 100 pages, then you are in for a real struggle to finish the book. There are so many minor boring charachters, and so many ships; that it is very hard to keep track. That being said, I slogged through the book and found some very interesting details and new information about this period and the times."
3,Good toys but mediocre quality,"My 3-yr old son loves the fact that he has a drill and flashlight with a swappable battery -- just like my real tools. However, when we got this product, the flashlight didn't work.After working out an arrangement with eToys to deal with the defective product, they told me to keep the broken flashlight and dispose of it if I wanted. Since it was headed for the trash anyway, I decided to take it apart -- at which point I noticed two loose wires inside. I re-soldered them and the flashlight works just fine now, but the rest of the solder joints inside look like a sneeze will knock them loose. It's a fun toy, but expect them to break with just the barest of knocking around or dropping."
5,Excellent companion to Exam Cram CCNA Book,This is a must have if your studying for the CCNA exam and work long hours. Great to use in the car or working out. The information helps reinforce what you already have learned and helps to tie in certain subjects that are vague. Great learning tool.
2,Dull and won't take an edge,"Dull as a butterknife out of the box.The edge was only beveled on one side of the blade, as if it had a chisel-ground edge. After reprofiling and an hour of work with diamond hones and ceramic rods, it's still ""factory sharp"" - that is, nowhere near.It has a comfortable grip, and looks tough and sturdy. The blade measures 4.5 inches long, the spine is 1/8th inch thick. I have no idea what the steel composition is, but its either junk stainless that won't take an edge, or incredibly hard steel that takes forever to sharpen.I had low expectations when I ordered this knife, but dullness wasn't one of them. If Taylor/Schrade had better quality control, it could be a great knife. As it stands, it's only mediocre. It seems suitable for chopping/whittling, and general camp and bushcraft chores. Save the better knives for game dressing.Design: +5 stars Mystery steel: -1 star Sharpness: -2 star Overall rating: 2 stars"
2,Fact and fiction are blurred,"This is not a book of facts in the usual sense of the term. Each of the ""facts"" is stated in plain text followed by a supplement in bold, where the supplement is the punch line. However, many of the ""facts"" are false, which can be misleading.For example, on page 33, there is the ""fact"":Dictator Emilio Julio of the little-known Latin American nation of El Schlopa won his country's first free election by a landslide.Of course, there is no country by that name. On page 31 there is the ""fact"":Louis Dimwit can count up to ten on the fingers of one hand.Which is clearly a joke in itself.The problem with the book is that some of the statements of fact are true, which could confuse the young reader, who would have difficulty telling the difference.For these reasons, I have a negative impression of the book. The jokes are suitable for a young crowd, but the blurring between fact and fiction is inappropriate for that age group."
4,"An interesting read, if no where near authoritative","This book was enjoyable to read. Books looking at messianic beliefs through history seem to be a burgeoning market. A better one covering the same material is Norman Cohn's The Pursuit of the Millenium. As well, there are books that cover a very specific part of the picuture, such as Michael Barkun's Religion and the Rascist Right, examining British-Isrealism and Christian Identity. Part of the charm of Messianic Revolution is its looseness in defining radical religious politics. It often seems the authors include an idea or group simply because it interests them and then they shoe horn it gently into the narrative. This may not make for a authoritative book but it does keep the story and subject interesting and should lead the reader to read more on this subject."
4,In one word : Underestimated!,"In two words : Strangely underestimated. I can not for the life of me understand why Izzy Stradlin doesn't receive the acclaim that his two great solo albums really deserve. Sure, Izzy Stradlin can't sing, but neither can half of the current ""alternative rock"" and ""britpop"" idols. Isn't being a bad singer sort of ""in""? And as far as his song writing skills go, this is still the same guy who wrote or co-wrote ""Don't Cry"" and several other Guns n' Roses hits. This is a hard rocking album with a fun cover of Chuch Berry's sentimental ""Memphis, Tennessee"" and some really good self-penned stuff, such as the title track, ""Here Before You"" and the melodic ""Bleedin'"". Okay, four stars might be a little generous, but three just didn't seem enough, 'cause Izzy was always the best of the lot when he was with G n'R, and he hasn't lost his skills."
1,Too grainy,I wouldn' t buy this again.Too grainy and thus sparkles too much while viewing it to the point that causes too much glare.
4,A Helpfull Reference and Introductory Text To Nav Arch,Applied Naval Architecture is a good introductory book for people interested in naval architecture. It encompases many relevant topics of ship design and stability. A great book for students and proffesionals alike. Simple concise and helpfull.
3,Kind of informative and has a few good tips,"Has some insight about how to get put on, but not much more than I already knew about."
3,Good Reference book.,"This book is o.k. can be better. I recommend the Steps to Stardom DVD which actually take you behind the doors of the music industry to gain information from current CEO's, A&R's, Producers, Engineers, etc. Good Reference book to have on the shelf!"
1,Not the Best Resource on the Music Business Anymore,"This book is a drag: its old fashioned, long-winded and tedious -there are much better books on the market that tell it like it REALLY is. Besides, it is not a very breezy read compared to a lot of other treatises out there on this topic - I won't name and names, but several other authors are much more up to date and write a more enjoyable read about the business side of the music business."
5,Mainstay Of The Music Business,"As a musician, composer, arranger, producer, recording engineer, audio studio owner, video production chief, theatrical sound designer, record label owner, and university educator, I have been using Krasilovsky's book as a reference since 1971. This is not a book for the casual reader. It requires serious inquiry. This tome is a no-nonsense, meat and potatoes, let's dig in and get the goods resource for the professional, as well as the dedicated wannabees. And now, it comes with a CD which makes life so much simpler for those who want to cut and paste their contracts and agreements with ease. Highly recommended, you would be doing yourself a favor if you use ""This Business"" to achieve your dreams."
4,get caught in the story,Indie style small cast production with good character development & ending that gets to your heart. quirky & quite memorable never seen anything like it before or since
2,Great idea marred by pitiful direction,"Lo is a great idea: a heartbroken man conjures a demon to help him bring back the lover who was snatched away by demons conveyed almost entirely in a black box theater format. It's a dialogue-driven exercise that had a lot of potential. Its low-budget effects are forgiveable, but the acting isn't. The demon Lo, played by Jeremiah Birkett under some serious latex, is fine and engaging. But the rest of the cast? Ugh.This film could have worked with the exact same production values and script (minus the completely unnecessary musical numbers) if the director had taken the time to lobby some good actors. As it stands, it's just a great idea that, unfortunately, came to the wrong guy."
1,Between $74 - $97 ???? REALLY?,"Not quite sure how to justify paying amounts of money people are paying for this ""movie""! If i got this movie at Redbox for a $1.25 i could have tolerated it. Luckily i had a friend who had the movie and wanted to see what the hype was about. Aside from a few parts in the movie that i thought were interesting and had its moments few and far in between it failed MISERSABLY! I understand what they were trying to do and i also understand they made it in a few days and it probably didn't have a large budget to make the movie, but not 3,4,5 star worthy buyer beware."
4,Es un buen libro,"El primer libro que lei de Paulo Coelho fue El Alquimista y quede maravillada. Desde entonces me converti en su fan y he tratado poco a poco de ir leyendo sus libros.El Demonio y la Señorita Prym es una historia interesante. Se trata sobre la lucha del Bien y el Mal, del Demonio y el Angel que todos llevamos a dentro y de como nuestras desiciones son las que determinan cual de los dos prevalence. Nadie es mejor ni peor que nadie, todos tenemos un lado bueno y un lado malo y todo depende de como sepamos lidiar con las cosas que nos pasan.Si te gusta Paulo Coelho de seguro disfrutaras esta novela, que en mi opinion no es mejor que El Alquimista, pero tiene una buena trama y sabias enseñanzas."
5,Best I've heard this year,"Heard ""In These Shoes"" on the Santa Fe alternative station and bought the CD. What lyrical talent! This is the CD Alanis Morissette wishes she could make. A must have."
5,Spectacular album in every way,"If an album could express the complexity and essential qualities of a person, this is one. Sure, it's a great dance album with big chunky Cuban overtones. And sure, it would be hard to find someone who this album would not appeal to, its likeability is so complete. But the artist reaches the listener on so many levels simultaneously. It's a pure and pleasurable assault that renders the listener helpless with amazement. On the surface, a fun romp, but underneath, deeply profound. I could not get enough of it, and wore out my first CD. The joy and abandonment and humor and wit the album displays is masterful. If I could given it a hundred stars, it wouldn't be enough."
4,"If you don't like this album, check your pulse.","Kirsty Maccoll was a liver of life, and by that I don't mean she went well with onions. I am admittedly prejudiced, in that she made this album with a close friend of mine. Even so, I can honestly say that this record made me laugh out loud -- which is quite something, considering she won't be making any more.She took life one banana at a time. Okay, that's stupid. Sorry. I'm gonna miss her. And ""Tropical Brainstorm"" is a whole lot of fun."
5,"vaya con Dios, Kirsty MacColl","The first Kirsty MacColl album I bought was Kite, which became a quick favorite with its humor and trenchant social insights. Kirsty's 'Electric Landlady' grew on me after time and I loved the track, 'It's my Affair,' which I believe was her first foray into Latin music. In 'Tropical Brainstorm,' Kirsty took her love of with la musica latina and went to town! The musical arrangements on this album are so well done and Kirsty's Spanish so adept, you'd never know this was the work of an English girl! One of the tracks not influenced by the Cuban vibe would be the lovely 'Autumngirlsoup'with its breathy vocals and gastronomic metaphors. Kirsty MacColl was one of those rare artists who got the joke. She was Oscar Wilde blended with Gloria Steinem and lately, even a little Celia Cruz. I hope she's swaying in a big hammock in heaven, drink in hand, and living 'con Alegria!'"
3,Great Product,"It's a great lotion to use if you don't like the feeling of tingle because the tingle power is very very mild and can barely be felt. It's more of a pleasant cooling sensation than that uncomfortable, my-skin-is-on-fire feeling! Definitely helps improve a tan quickly, even if you're at a tanning plateau!"
4,The Secret to a darker tan!,"While tanning i noticed that i wasn't getting any darker than i was i thought all hope was lost. I was recommended to switch up my lotions and use 2 different ones. Even though i HATE tingles, this one is very mild. I love this lotion i would say this lotion honestly made me so much dareker than what i was. I would recommend using it every once in a while, not every time. I will warn that the lotion made me a little red for the first 10 minutes after tanning, but turned straight to a beautiful tan! Awesome Stuff, and a fairly reasonable price compared to others!!"
1,Holy Lobster Burn,I put the lotion on and I put my lotion on prior to leaving to go tan (because it my other lotion works better when I has time to absorb) so not even after 5 minutes of putting it on I started feeling like I was burning from the inside out! I had to get in the shower and try and wash it off (didn't help or work). I literally turn so red and got so hot I sat in a towel for 30 minutes and still felt crappy!
3,arms and chest are on fire !!,"Wow so i've been reading others reviews on this and they all say they can barely feel the tingle..first let me say this is the first tingle i've ever used...i have a good base tan and decided to try this because my salon recommended it to me for a ""tingle virgin"" lol...i was a little skitish so i only applied it to my arms, chest and legs..my legs are fine..i feel very mild warmth on them..but my arms and chest are red and very hot! At some points uncomfortable. As i'm typing this it seems to be easing up a bit and it's been about an hour since i've gotten out of the tb.ON THE PLUS SIDE THE COLOR IS GREAT! i'm thinking from now on just putting this on my legs. So if you can stand the heat get it..don't know why i seem to be the only one this is so potent on..maybe cuz i'm a newbie tingler?? Happy Tanning Everyone!"
2,Sensitive Skin Sizzler,"I REALLY wanted to like this lotion BUT, it pains me to use it. Literally. The tingle in it was very umm....hardcore. If tingle doesn't bother you then it might be a great product. Instead of this, I now use dangerously dark (also by swedish beauty) and cannot be more pleased."
4,Not too much tingle but a great scent!,Im rating this 4 stars simply because the tingle isnt quite as strong as what I was hoping for but the scent of this lotion even hours after tanning is fantastic! Ive never used a lotion that I didnt have to shower withn an hour of tanning to avoid the self-tanning smell. This would definitely be great for someone who is wanting a little warm up or who hasnt used a tingle lotion before.
3,"it's ok, but it lost its tingle!","i loved this lotion when i first got it. gave me a boost when i needed it. but i stopped laying for a couple of months, then started again and i used that lotion but it didn't tingle like it use too ! and i had half a bottle left and i had to throw it away !! i won't buy this lotion again."
1,OMG - Burn,Ok I used this thankfully only a sample bc I forgot my normal non-tingle lotion and I do have to say that I hate it! While I was in the bed I felt like my entire body was on fire. Once I got out I was really blotchy all over my body. I had to take a Benydril just to calm it down. I have used tingles before and it wasn't pleasant but did have great results but this was insane and not worth the results. and I pray that by tomorrow I won't be so red and blotchy...
4,Good lotion,"I used this lotion one day because I didn't have anything else available. Little did I know I'd really end up liking it! It's a mild tingle, so mild I only felt the tingle on parts of my legs which was weird, but I end up getting significant color after using this. It smells good which is always a plus, too. My favorite thing about this lotion is its so thick I feel like it's really moisturizing my skin well. Swedish Beauty doesn't let me down!"
3,Not that great,"This Tanning lotion made me itch really bad for about an hour after I used it. It did however make me look super dark, I have only used it once so maybe your body needs to get used to it."
2,Not the best...,"I have tried many Swedish Beauty products and this isn't the best. The lotion is a light color, and has a pretty sheen/shimmer to it but the tingle/bronzer just aren't up to par in my opinion.The tingle is very faint, and I guess would be ok for a first time or light skinned tanner?"
3,Good Product,The first time i used this lotion i got out of the bed and thought i had completely fried myself. my skin was so red and itchy but after an hour or so it went away and i had a nice tan. I definantly reccomend having a base tan first but overall i like it. I don't use the lotion if i have to go somewhere right after i hit the tanning bed because of how red and uncomfortable i am for a little while after.
3,Not what I expected,"I have been tanning in a tanning bed for about a month and a half. I bought this thinking it was a pretty good lotion..Yesterday was my first time using a tingle lotion. The tingle wasn't bad, the itching is kinda irritating tho. But when I got out of the tannign bed I automatically started peeling all over. Which I don't understand why because I keep my skin moisturized all the time..so now I am pretty much starting over with my tan. Because I peeled so bad..And I really didn't notice a difference in my skin either. No reddening..Maybe first time fluke?"
2,Not a whole lot of tingle,"I received this order in a timely manner, which was nice. However I was slightly disappointed when I used it for the first time. I was expecting some tingle factor and there was none. I'm going to use it a couple more times this week and hope for the best!"
5,Not for first timers!,"I love this stuff! It used to burn REALLY bad and I would get super lobster red! But then I started tanning more, n I love this stuff! N it smells super good! I will always use this!!"
2,Tingle doesn't cover it,"I know you're supposed to get a little red and itchy from a tingle lotion, but this stuff was crazy. I felt like I had a sunburn for the better part of a day. Smells nice though."
5,A wonderfull product,I love this product it will get you dark in a hurry it does have a tingle to it you will be fire red when you get off the tanning bed .After about a hour the rednest will go away and it will turn dark.A wonderfull product.
2,Big rash!,"I used this product and immediately broke out in a itchy rash. In already medium skinned. I've had my tanning bed 12 yrs and have used numerous lotions. I've never had a instant reaction, as with this lotion. It does make you darker, but rash can take days to disappear. It was tingly and felt like it was burning in certain areas of my skin."
2,Cheap for a reason,Cons:1) Bad Smell (couldn't wait to shower to get rid of smell)2) Awful itchy burning sensation (I get that it is a tingle lotion but c'mon)3) I tan really easily and noticed no difference from this lotion4) Left my tan weird and splotchy in areas (booooo)Pros:1) Cheap ( ..yeah thats about all that is good)
3,"Very itchy, but if you can stand it.. it's great.","I find this lotion very unbareable, sadly. When I got out of the tanning bed, It made me so itchy & hot & got me so red. My skin felt like it was on fire, it was so itchy and red that I had to take a shower once I got home.It gives you a great color though. The first time I used it, it got me about 2 or 3 shades darker. Only used it twice because of how itchy it made my skin though. If you can stand an intense tingle lotion.. then this product is great for you. But if you can't stand a strong tingle, try something else. I personally don't think it's worth the suffering. It did give me GREAT color though. :)"
4,Just a bit disappointed,This cd was excellent with what was recorded but there are a few pieces of music that was not included in the disc i.e. Hawaii Five-O
4,Musica candente y un ritmo espectacular.,"Este es uno de los discos de merengue con más ritmo que jamás haya escuchado (Exitos). Ideal para fiestas y para practicar este baile tan de moda. Es cierto que ha Kinito Mendez le falta pulirse en la letra, pero al fin y al cabo lo que cuenta es la musica y el ritmo. Adquiérelo y ponte a bailar con el mejor sabor latinoamericano. Es de adquisición obligatoria para los amantes del merengue."
4,Inspiration,"Chris plays for our youth group every Wednesday night at our church, and he always inpires us to share God's word with our families, friends, neighbors, etc. and inspires us to just live our lives fully for God. I love his cd because it inspires me to live for Christ just like he inspires us every Wednesday night! Thank you Chris for your wonderful music, inspiration, and Godly example!"
3,A WWF Tape without the big stars!,"Tough Guys is a 60 minute long WWF Tape from the collector Series! That Tape includes Matches between The Bushwhackers and the Power of pain, Jim Duggan vs. Borris Zhukov, Ronnie Garvin vs. Haku and many more! But no Hogan etc.! A Nice Video but not a must!"
3,Great for the wrestling collector,I tend to favor the Collector Series videos of WWF just because they seem like they are harder to find. These were more serious releases from back in the day. The old clamshell and big cardboard box releases used to be hokey and funny. While I liked that it was always nice to just get a serious approach to these videos sometimes. Pick it up if you like old school WWF. This tape has a lot of mid card guys at the time on it which I tend to like.
3,The smell is strong with this one.....,"Yes, while this was an effective tea product in the evening before bed, the smell is STRONG! I passed out some samples to co-workers and frankly, it reminded them of stinky feet. I got used to the smell and the taste, but some people can't overcome it. Like my husband, he hated it when I made it before bed, even with my lemon added. So I'd say stick with the Sleepy Time Extra(with Valerian) only because the smell is so pungent."
4,Living & Working in the Netherlands,"This book has a lot of useful information, and includes good case studies of different individuals' experiences of moving to the Netherlands. The only thing missing is the reference to web sites for accessing information online, such as apartment rentals. I also would have liked to see some photographs."
4,Sushi: Fish is Great Live!,This CD set is a great live recording. It contains most of Fish's best songs and includes the cheering fans singing along. It is a must have for any Fish fan!
4,I think Aaron's da bomb but this single doesn't turn me on!,"I got this back in 1998 but it didn't turn me on and when I listen to it now, it still doesn't! Well, i guess you can't like everything right?"
1,"I wonder who his ""crazy little party girl"" is? Someone that can stay up past 7:30?","Yuck. Just...yuck. He couldn't sing then, and he still can't sing now. Thanks for degrading pop, Aaron. Good for a little kid's birthday party, but nothing else."
2,Crazy little Aaron Carter,"Again a Song by Nick's little brother. Again a Song in which he proves that he Can't sing.You can play this song at the birthdayparty of your 7-year old sis. No that's nasty. You should be nice to your lil'sis.This single contains the Radio version, a Remix and the Instrumental verion"
1,Tedious recapitulation of the obvious,"How many cliches can a consultant craft into a single disjointed book? Too many. The examples are tired; the insights are obvious, and the conclusions familiar. Save your time and money."
3,"When I published my online review, I had only read 1 chapter","I think it's a very great book, but I don't think it is as good as the original Net Force novel. The summary of this book is a little bit boring compared to the original novel"
3,virtual vandals,"If you like computers and technology you would like this book. I am not a big fan of this kind of story but I still enjoyed it. It was about a young man who was trying to solve a case for the Net Force Explorers. Clancy did an excellent job of predicting the future and what the technology will be like a few years from now... Overall i thought the book was kind of boring though, it was a little too slow for me."
2,Virtual Reality vs. Reality,"The thought of the book is really a great thought, but VR vs. R has been approached so many times that people pretty much know what's expected of it and can probably predict the ending of most books of this nature.I'm not really a Tom Clancy fan, but this book was okay. I read the original Net Force and I liked it a lot. I even watched the movie which is nothing like the book.I'm so used to reading other computer books that talk about a lot of technical stuff that I decided to read a book that was based on computer knowledge, but it's not necessarily bound by computers. If you are a young adult that likes computers or virtual reality and the thought of the future being so high tech then this is a must read. If you're going to read the series then at least read the first Net Force book to see what the whole plot is and how they came up with all of the additional books."
2,Tom Clancy? I don't think so...,"After reading Clancy's books for sometime, I somehow feel this is not him at all. After reading the rather thin book, I almost think that the book was written by some amatuer or beginner. The story is like Hardy Boys gone high tech. Very predictable. I recommend that you read his OTHER books, like Ruthless.com or Rainbow Six..."
4,"Good, but not complete","I found this book to be very good but don't understand why they chose not to include ALL of his tales. They used only 80% of his stories, leaving out:-Azathoth-Ex Oblivione-Memory-Nyarlathotep-Old Bugs-Sweet Ermengarde-The Book-The Descendant-The Very Old Folk-What the Moon BringsGranted three of those are only fragmentary, but I still believe they should have all been included for the sake of completeness. Even if they only used the other 7 it still would had made this book that little bit better."
4,The foundation of illbient music,"I had ordered this as a vinyl record straight from the record label, theagriculture. It was made in 1994 by Lloop, a member of the ambient-dub trio We. Its very interested in that its structure evolves much like a Dj mix. I write this review having experience with it on vinyl, which is pretty different from having a cd version, but the music is just the same. It just more...acessable on vinyl.The music itself is phat. Some of it is pretty dated sounding, but one must keep in mind the date it was made. And I have not heard anything like it before, except maybe Dj Spooky's Songs of a Dead Dreamer. Both incorporate a sort of enveloping, spatial, urban enivornmental setting to the music, which can suck you in if you are not careful - i.e. don't drive with this music in the cd player, it will probably increase the chances of a car wreck, with you being at fault."
5,AWESOME PRODUCT!,"This stuff is amazing. It takes the supplements I use and combined into one easy serving, like it was made for me. My older AQHA show horse used to get hock injections and now he only receives one heaping scoop of this (along with B-L Pellets). Great product!"
4,GUNFORCE REVIEW,Gunforce is game where you have to save the world from aliens but it's not like other sci-fi games for Super Nintendo. First reason: You can drive strange vehicles and even pilot a helicopter on the first of only five levels and you can even drive a boat across the water on the fourth level. Second reason: It's easy to beat after playing it awhile for those of you who are not good at playing sci-fi games. I've beaten this game five times and I still find it fun. What makes it funner though is when you're playing with someone else. The only thing that's bad though is that it is a one hit you're dead game.
4,A fascinating new perspective on the meaning of mental retar,"Rosemary Crossley discovered (or rediscovered)facilitation training (FCT), and here she tells how and why. FCT is a means of communication with people with communication impairment - people with autism, or Down syndrome, or cp - and the real point of Speechless is that it makes us ask whether these people can't talk because they're mentally retarded or whether they get labelled as retarded because they can't talk. If you believe it really happens, that is: there's a lot of controversy around FCT, and Crossley has been accused of many things, charges she answers in this book. A must for anyone dealing with a non-speaker"
1,what I get is not England kit kat,what I get is not England kit kat but kit kat made in germany and and there is a huge deferent in taste so there is kind of cheat in this item
2,Expensive Not Worth It,Candy came as though someone just grabbed a handful of bars and shipped them out in a carboard box. I thought British candy would taste better but this Kit Kat taste as though it has less sweetness than the American version. I would save my money and buy local instead.
3,Just So,"The covers on this collection are, like may Beatles covers, sometimes hard to appreciate. For whatver reason, while I really enjoy practically any Dylan song covered by practically any artist, many Beatles songs suffer at the hands of other artists.That's not to say these are bad, but it does speak to the relative strengths, and differences of both the Beatles and Dylan. Both Lennon/McCartney and Dylan are master songsmiths, and both are masters at the delivery of the songs in their respective catalogs, but the Beatles, of course, were top notch performers in a more popular format, and naturally occupy a larger public space in the hearts and minds of the music-loving masses. The chances a lot of folks even realize they're listening to a Dylan song being performed by someone else is certainly nowhere near the chances of someone realizing, 'hey, that's a Beatles song!' And that makes all the difference in the world."
5,Ooooooooh.....Aaaaaaaah,"I love, love, love this assortment. Yes, the 86% cacao Midnight Reverie replaces the mint that's shown and to my mind, that's a good thing. I find it intense, but not bitter, but that could be personal preference. The intensity helps me limit myself to a few squares, so I get indulgence plus antioxidants. Highly recommended!"
5,I Have Spoken.,All of the chocolate arrived with out melting an not broken in peices. The taste is supreme and melts just right. This is a 2 Quantity buy because 1 is not enough. Starting with the Assortment which will make the best impression on the taste buds.
2,Didn't receive what was pictured,"I was really looking forward to receiving these chocolates when I purchased them. The Mint Bliss is probably my favorite chocolate and I was looking forward to trying the Espresso Escape. Unfortunately I did not receive what I ordered. The assortment pack I received included Evening Dream, Twilight Delight and Intense Dark (which I do not like at all). You have to make sure you send people what they order."
3,Could be 5 stars,"Daaaark! In this Large package of all solid dark chocolates squares are varied by the percentage of it's purity - 50%, 70 and 80%. The 50% is excellent and the higher percentage chocolates (In my opinion) should only be used for baking. Then again I found no problem finishing these with help from friends. The bag contained much more of the 50% with less again for the darker squares."
4,"60 is good, 72 is good, 86 is blech.","I like dark chocolate and wanted to like this, but the 86% cacao are just too much. Barely edible, IMO. Unless you are sure you like that much bitter, maybe opt for singles instead of the variety pack."
1,Disappointed!!!!,I ordered this chocolate as a Mother's Day gift and when they arrived they were dried out and discolored. I believe they had melted at some point. Not exactly what you want your Mom to get on her special day. At least Amazon customer service was great and issued a full refund.
1,Misrepresented,"The only reason I purchased this item was to get the Mint Bliss chocolates and when I received the item, there were none of those included. Very disappointed!"
1,Horrible,I am not a big chocolate fan. I bought this because it was dark chocolate. All three varieties of assortment taste horrible. I never ate a cardboard but I think cardboard might taste better than this. I tried few pieces of Hershley's bliss dark chocolate and it is much better than this product.
2,not so good,the chocolate was discolored and bland tasting. had to say more to get the 18 words required to get this to work.
4,Ghirardelli Intense Dark Premium Dark Chocolate Assortment 50 PackGhirardelli,"Overall very good, but some were too bitter for my liking. However, no complaints, it's chocolate. My husband loved the most bitter ones so all were eaten and fast. It was a good sample and I wrote down the 2 I liked best."
3,Taste is OK,"Not a great buy. The taste is fine but ""bang for the buck"" isn't there. I found twice as much for half the price at Costco."
1,How did this guy get a book deal?,"Hey, if this guy can do it, you too can get published. That's about the only thing I learned from this book. This rambling, disjointed, poorly-organized guide on how to write is really no help at all."
5,For My Money the Best Book on Writing Ever Written,"If you have to read one book on writing, pick Writing in General and the Short Story in Particular. It matters not if you are an aspiring fiction writer or craft journalistic feature stories, you will savor the time spent with Rust Hills book.This is a practical writing guide. It explains in an understandable fashion all the techniques of fiction - from Character and Action, Foreshadowing and Suspense to Irony and Point of View in a simple and useable fashion.

4,Nowhere to go?,"A very nice analysis of the correlation between the transport networks in and out of a developing country, and its level of affluence. Hilling explains all the forms of transport - ports, roads, rail and air, and how these affect and can limit the productivity of the regions they service. He surveys examples from all over the world.Certainly, he shows how a poor network inside a developing country can leave entire regions backward, even relative to the rest of the country, let alone to the developed world. It isolates them, making it too expensive to sell their goods in a broader market. Thus these poor regions cannot use what is often their only comparative advantage - the cheap cost of their labour.By comparison, regions with very good transport, especially to the developed world, can lift themselves out of poverty within a generation. Hilling cites the cases of Hong Kong and Singapore, which in fact rose to developed status."
4,Nice modification of Kotlers guides with good examples,If you find yourself unorganized or just new in public sector PR or marketing dept this is a handbook for you. Plain modifications of general market guides for a bit less direct-money-making areas.
4,Advice for governments and nonprofit groups about how to spread the word about their programs.,"Philip Kotler and Nancy Lee encourage governments to learn from private sector marketing principles and techniques. It's a great idea, and they make a persuasive case that ""social marketing"" can change society, or at least certain aspects of it. The book is full of practical tips. Using examples from social marketing campaigns around the world, Kotler and Lee demonstrate how to apply basic marketing ideas in the public sector. Creative approaches have injected new life into many social programs, ranging from environmental awareness to customer service. We recommend this book to public officials and leaders of nonprofit organizations who are looking for new ways to educate their constituents."
3,One great song and...,"I remember (with warm feelings) the Orange County Teen Club dances of my youth.One of my favorite songs from those dances was ""One Fine Morning"" by the group Lighthouse.You remember those days, Rare Earth, Blood Sweat & Tears, Chicago... etc, when actual bands played dances and actually had horn sections... I was so nostalgic, that I bought this album thinking that I only remember one song, but it should all be good.Oops!One good song, mediocre reproduction and a bunch of stuff I didn't bother to copy into my 70's folder of music on my computer.Nostalgia can be sweet, but if you want this song, you are better off to pay for a single song download."
5,A fan from Youngstown Ohio,"I only had one chance to see/hear Lighthouse ""Live"" and they had a no frills ass-kicking concert at the Tomorrow Club in Youngstown , Ohio!Outstanding from beginning to end! I wish I could have heard them again , I wish they would release all there catalog on CD format.Dreams do come true."
3,Isn't this collection missing a song?,"I didn't buy this, but I see from the posted track listings that this rather expensive cd doesn't include 8 miles high...does not compute."
4,BS&T Meets ELO,"One of the many horn bands of the 70s, Lighthouse took a bit of a different spin from others. Along with a 5-piece rhythm section and 4 horns, they also added a string quartet. Think of Blood Sweat & Tears meets ELO. Add to that some really good singing - nice baritone voices singing 3 part harmony, and occasionally sounding a bit like Three Dog Night - and all that adds up to Lighthouse.This CD includes most of their best stuff - great swaggering brass pieces like ""One Fine Morning"", ""Silver Bird"", and the travelling musician's lament, ""Broken Guitar Blues."" If you liked BS&T or the Ides of March, you'll probably like Lighthouse."
2,"Close, But Not Close Enough","When I heard that these Lighthouse tunes were available on CD, I was quite happy to say the least. The selections on this disc are the best songs from their later albums, all post RCA. However, I was greatly dissapointed by the production. The bass solo in One Fine Monring is not the same one that is on vinyl. In addition, the horns have bad (cracked) notes that were not on the original recordings. It sounds as if some alternate tracks were used. The mixes are nowhere close to the records from the 70's. If these type of things don't bother you, then get the CD. If they do, avoid this disc and dig out your old LPs."
4,Fun CD,"Bought this to get ""Pretty Lady"", a hard to find mid chart success for Lighthouse in '74. An earlier reviewer makes a connection between Lighthouse and Blood, Sweat and Tears and ELO. I would differ on that slightly, hearing similarities to Blood, Sweat and Tears and Chicago. Many of the tracks are highly listenable."
5,Stupendous and Moving!,"I absoultely love this soundtrack and movie! The music means more to me than ever because, me being in my high school award-winning marching band, we played selections from this movie! And I get teary-eyed when I think of the music and begin to dread the thought of marching season being over in less than a week. The music is fun, moving, wonderful, great, and something you'll always remember... I will, anyways."
4,Good product and works!,This product has been reliable and trustworthy for all the needs I have. It works great for the joints in the horse.
2,Product information incorrect?,"The product is called Glucosamine 5000, and according to Animed's website contains 5000 mg of glucosamine per oz. Yes the description here states ""500mg Glucosamine"".Plus, the product is 16 oz (or 1 lb). Why is the item weight described as 2 lbs? I understand shipping weight could be more because of packaging, but this description has both item and shipping weight, and item weight is given as 2 lbs.Not sure if the sellers are being shady, or merely don't pay any attention to how they describe their wares."
5,"Brilliant, Profound, and Laugh Out Loud Funny","Imagine the love-child of Dorothy Parker and James Thurber. She's that good, only better. More heart and a wilder imagination, as well as touch of the poet and a love of wordplay. Like Irish music, Connor's writing makes me laugh for joy while weeping for the world's sadness. Among my favorites: the elegaic ""Let Us Praise Famous Dead White Men"" and ""Midlife Barbie"". Anyone who has ever dreamed of hanging out with a star will love ""Driving with Ray"". Anyone who has loved one or more of the following writers: Lorrie Moore, Veronica Geng, T.C. Boyle, Kafka, or KAthy Acker will enoy History Lessons."
4,The Best of Realistic Children's Fiction,"I started reading this book as a high schooler and ended reading it allowed to my sisters who were elementart and pre-elementary aged. They wouldn't let me stop...and so I read deep into the evening and finished the book.I like children's books that properly handle tough subjects, because children need to hear those types of stories to help them cope and sympathize. The pacing was wonderful, the plot unpredictable, and the depths the reader(young or old) are taken to will change their lives.A sweet and sometimes sour story that you will be glad you picked up and read. Also great to read aloud."
4,Because of Anya,"Anya is a 10-year-old girl trying to cope with a disease that is causing her hair to fall out. She is concerned that someone will notice her wig that she wears to cover her bald head. Anya just wants her hair to grow back but no one, not even the doctors, knows if it ever will.Keely, Anya's classmate notices Anya's wig and doesn't know what to do. Her friend Stef wants her to pull on the wig to see if it is real. Keely knows it is wrong to pull on the wig but has a hard time saying no. She is afraid to face her fears and stand up for what she knows is right."
4,Because of Anya,"Anya was a perfectly normal ten-year-old girl, or so she thought she was. Then her hair begins to fall out, due to an incurable diesease called alopecia areata. When she has to get a wig, she is terrified someone will find out about it, and keeping it a secret from the rest of the class, Anya is miserable. However, when Stef, the class bully, notices, she tells her friends Keely, Tory and Nicole that Anya is dying from cancer, and has to wear a wig. Keely wants to help Anya because she was friends with her in kindergarten, before Keely met Stef. Then Anya's worst nightmare happens when her wig comes off during gym. Thinking Stef pulled it off, Keely is furious. Then she finds our differently and goes to visit Anya, who tells her if she really wants to help, she must give up her hair. Will Keely be able to do this, and will Anya have the courage to return to school? Find out in Margaret Peterson Haddix's Because of Anya."
4,Because of Anya,"Ten-year-old Anya is a young girl who discovered that she had alopecia areata, a disease that makes you lose your hair. Soon Anya is bald and wearing a wig to school, but she doesn't want anyone to know. Keely is struggling with some problems of her own. She is constantly being pushed around by her friends and cannot seem to stand up to Stef, the leader. Keely and her friends find out about the wig and they want to know why she is wearing it. One day at gym class Anya's wig comes off. The whole class now knows Anya's secret. Keely decides she has to help Anya; but what can she do? Will Anya ever grow her hair back? To find out read Because of Anya by Margaret Peterson Haddix."
4,Because of Anya,"This is a very informative book about alopecia areata from a child's point of view. This is a good book for later elementary children to read. It helps prepare them in advance for what they might have to face, their friends may have to face, or something they are already facing. The book is very well written and put together. Also it helps kids to see they don't have to follow everything that their friends do. Stef tries to boss everybody around, but Keely finally stands up to her. This is a good example for children. It helps children to see that they can be their own individual person and stand up for themselves. It takes you on a journey with Anya from when she first finds out about the disease to later on. You are able to experience her experiences with her as she encounters them. This book would hold a readers attention and appeal to a wide range of readers."
3,Credible....yet bizarre,"This book was a good read until the last chapter or so. It went off on a nutritional/work out tangent that will leave most readers going ""Huh?"" Anyway, the methods outlined are quite good...similar to Applegate and Pentecost (possibly it influenced the latter). For pure instruction, I would go with Pentecost's book since it is much more to the point...but Bloody Iron is a much more enjoyable read.....these guys share their prison stories. Plus you get to see some pretty horrific fashions from the 70's era!"
3,STRANGE LITTLE BOOK,"This book, written by a pair of ex-convicts, was amusing and strange. A lot of space was devoted to nutrition (with some questionable data), physical conditioning, and a dubious ""history"" of knife fighting. The techniques depicted vary from good to ill advised, but are definitely worth a look. There is some good advice in this book, but it cannot be considered ""all good."" I would recommend this book based solely upon the authors' numerous anecdotes (from barroom brawls to fighting with sharpened NAIL CLIPPERS in juvie hall). Bizarre!!!"
4,A good basic guide to knife use and defense by authors who have lived on the dark side.,"As a retired police officer and law enforcement trainer, I have always believed one should seek out knowledge from every source, including your enemies. Though the photographs are not very clear; nevertheless, the information in this book is important to anyone who is interested in how to use a knife or defend against a knife attack. As anyone knows who have actually been in fights on the street, violence never quite looks like it does in the movies. In most cases, it is brutal and bloody.The authors showing the techniques appear at times to be uncoordinated and sloppy in the photographs, but I find that a plus because real combat is ugly. In conclusion, this is a book for anyone interested in basic knife use and defense against a blade attack.Rating: 4 Stars, (Author: Basic Knife Use and Knife Defense for Law Enforcement officers course manual)."
5,Yes - Yes - Yes,"Let me help you decide - this book is a Must Have. Easy to understand, well organized, straight forward and virtually indespensable."
2,Disappointment for Experienced Gardeners,"After reading all the positive reviews here, I waited in anticipation for this book's arrival. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. Gardeners in the West or Southwest will find little-to-nothing about their area in this book, since it concentrates mainly on the North and South. Try Sunset's ""Western Garden Book"" instead. Looking for in-depth lawn care information? You won't find it here! Get Stuart Franklin's ""Building A Healthy Lawn"" instead, which has no glossy pictures, but provides more information on lawns. This book misses the mark on garden design inspiration, too. There are so many other, better books on this topic as well. Mainly geared to the neophyte gardener who has just moved or inherited a garden, ""The Lawn and Garden Owner's Manual"" lacks detailed coverage on subjects that serious gardeners crave."
2,I can't believe other readers gave this a 10!,"Although the subject matter of this novella was gripping, I was disappointed at how little I cared about these characters. The narration seemed distant and did not draw me into the characters. I was glad that I spent only a few hours reading it because I didn't feel I had completely wasted my time."
5,"Haunting, tragic and gorgeous","This is one of the most engrossing 20th century fictions I've read. The narrative is lyrical and almost dreamlike, which shifts the reader's mindscape twice: once to distant memories of childhood and the open-eyed wonder of coming of age, and once again to the emotional distance that we must put between ourselves and those hardest moments.Gunn's voice is often dark and macabre - at times you feel for Janey's abandonment amidst her hard-partying parents and the adults who pay all forms of discomforting attention to her. The prose is tactile, yet fluid, a word on the tongue and a fleeting sensation of what was and will never again be."
3,"Tight, concise, a little uncomfortable","Under a hundred pages, but full of emotion and at times beautiful writing. You get a strong feeling for each of the characters and though certain events are fairly obviously foreshadowed, the time when the truth comes out is still quite powerful. Near the end I was actually uncomfortable with what was happening, cringing at what was happening, it isn't very often that I feel anything for characters in a book, but Gunn's writing brings them out and makes it easy it identify with the them, and no more so than in the more difficult moments. A good book, well worth the 3-5 hours it may take to read."
4,Stick to time travel and lose the statistics next book,"Summary: Interesting read but when Gott left time travel physics to discuss statistics and probability theory the book became bland like author was padding his essential [time travel, nature of the universe, beginnings, etc & TOE-chasing] published papers with his other non-essential statistical theory work."
3,What can and can't happen in time travel.,"The major flaw of this book is the author's own breast beating about his published papers on time travel. A little to much ego written between the lines. This book starts out very good on time travel to the future, but bogs down in the middle half. The part of time travel to the past gets very confusing and almost boring at times. The last part of the book gets into the 95% preditions of how long something will last. This to me was totally boring and not even relevant to time travel as a physical reality. On the overall it will give a person a fairly good insight into what science knows for sure about possible time travel."
3,I find a mistake,According in pages 68 and 69. Astra must think Eartha 11.8 years instead of 10 years if her departure from alpha centauri is thought to be 8.2 years. I think the best replacement is Astra thinks that he departure from Alpha is simulaneous with Earhta on Earth 6.4 years from the start.
1,Much Ado About Nothing,"Gott and his co-researcher, Li-Xin Li, have proposed a truly novel and entertaining bit of poppycock to explain the origin of the universe. On Page 186, Gott writes: ""The Universe could have a geometry that would allow it to go back in time and create itself. The Universe could be its own mother."" Like other quantum physicists--such as Vilenkin, Linde, Smolin, and Hawking--Gott fails to explain adequately the primordial mechanisms that endowed empty space, virtual particles, black holes, etc., with the potential to work their magic. The ancient Roman sage Lucretius is still right: ex nihilo nihil fit."
5,"The all-time high -Accurate, well written, funny, scary!","Mirabile is the best linked short-story collection of sci-fi I have ever read--it is really more like a single book with very well defined chapters. The stories stick in your mind, making you want to read it over and over again, and every time you do--you will find something new!It is suitable for all ages and interests, exceptionally good at pointing out the ecological niches of organisms known and unkown and how they might relate on a new planet...From cows to bats, firestarting plants to fuzzywillies, Kagan has a handle on just how things might be made to work.The best of the sci-fi market, Janet Kagan has only one fault in my mind -- I can't wait for more"
3,For fans of rose hips and hibiscus!!,This tea smells very good. It has coriander in it which promises a wonderfully spicy cup. Unfortunately the overload of hibiscus and rose hips makes the typical Celestial seasoning herb brew which tastes the same no matter what they call it. The flavor is primarily sour and ashy. There is a faint hint of orange. No spice is detectable when brewed.
4,Are You a Bored Christian?,"Many Christians become pew-sitters and feel bored with their lives. Spiritual apathy can result as they suffer from a non-Biblical but traditional mindset that ""professional"" ministers are the really special ones while they are just ordinary nobodies. The Bible states that everyone is relevant and needed in the kingdom of God; each one with a destiny and ministry! This book is inspirational and helps us to see a place where each person can express who God created them to be and use it for the upbuilding of the kingdom. A liberating paradigm shift!"
2,Too much Wicca...not enough Saxon...,"This is a hard review to write because I actually enjoyed reading this book. I have always thought Buckland had a style that reflected a certain mingling of reason and passion that appealed to me. You know...the kind of thing that I wish I could capture in my writing. And I cannot praise Buckland enough for that.However...If you want to be a Germanic ""Witch"" and worship those Gods (and you have no idea how much I hope you do) this book is a mis-represntation of Saxon thought and worship. Too much Wicca...not enough Saxon.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE...look atWitchdom of the True (A Study of the Van-Troth and the Practice of Seidr)and read my review of that book. I wish every Wiccan would make that the next book they read. Especially if your thoughts are already drifting toward a more Germanic experience of Witchcraft."
4,Ray does it again!,"This book is only based on history, not taken from it directly, so if you want the ""real"" thing, keep looking. HOWEVER, this is an excellent book for those who want to get in touch with their heritage, without diving through 2000 some odd years of history. I, personally, don't use the rituals provided, but I did enjoy reading it, and will pass it along to all my students. It does contain enough of a basis in historical fact to make it worthwhile reading for those along a Tuetonic or Saxon path."
3,DIY modern neo-paganism with a mildy Saxon flavor,"OK, I'll admit I talked myself into buying this on the slim chance it actually had anything to do with real, historic, Anglo-Saxon paganism. As far as I can tell, it doesn't, and Buckland made the whole thing up, at least partly in response to power politics within existing Wiccan groups, and basing it on existing neopagan rituals with an thin overlay of Anglo-Saxon culture, much of which appears to be used incorrectly and out of context. So much for the historical aspects.As a religious or philosophical work, although it feels a bit dated, it seems to hang together pretty well and doesn't present any glaring internal contradictions. It's a friendly religion, as religions go. If it gives someone the tools they need to deal with the world, more power to them."
1,How come no 0 stars offered here?,I don't think so Buckland. This is quite a lot of hogwash and I think you know it. But it stills sells in this country doesn't it?
1,This is NOT Anglo-Saxon Witchcraft,"If you are looking for the Anglo-Saxon Way, this book is not it. Buckland writes, (invents), a 'Saxon' version of Wicca which has ZERO basis in historical fact. Despite what some of the earlier Wiccan reviewers say, There is NOTHING in this book of value to an Anglo-Saxon witch. Hel, they can't even pronounce Wicca correctly!"
2,Which Witch Is Witch :),"Okay so which Witch is witch? I am just wanting some clarification because I want to know why there are two of these. One the ""complete book"" and the other ""the complete tree"" of Saxon Witchcraft? Forget you wrote the first one LOL??? Just kidding I think! Really though how come your coven if you really do have one isn't found by anyone and you never answer the question about it? Oh and how come you started this coven if you only wanted to sell books about it? I don't get it. The book says one thing, but your personal life is saying something entirely different? This book wasn't all that bad but I am now figuring out most of these are all fictional that are so hyped that some people actually believe them. It sort of gives real pagans a bad name if you know what I mean."
4,Sonic X keychain,"This little keychain is for my daughter, who loves all things Sonic X. The item was reasonably priced and delivered promptly. The detail and quality of the character sparks my daughter's imagination. We are very pleased with this product."
2,Not a good choice if you want a large-print edition,"The print in this Bible is of a nice, large size, but the readability is totally ruined by the amount of show-through from one page to the next. I don't think I've ever seen another Bible printed on paper with this much show-through. It makes reading so difficult that it defeats the purpose of having large print."
3,KJV Personal Size Giant Print Reference Bible,"Bible is in very good shape, print is large. I mistakenly purchased this bible as a reference bible... It is not a reference bible, but a reference edition. There wasn't a way to ""look inside"" on this particular purchase. Very good bible, just not what I intended to purchase."
5,KJV Personal Size Giant Print Reference Bible (Bonded Leather) Thomas Nelson publisher,"Easy to read print, good binding, comfortable size to carry around and a suprisingly decent concordance for a bible this size.I am very pleased with this bible."
1,Read-Along Notes Ruin This Bible For Me,"On the positive side the overall size of this Bible, the print, paper and binding quality are all close to ideal.However, Nelson's ""Read-Along-References"" ruin this Bible for me. They are very poorly done and are basically like having a poor translation mixed in with your Bible. At the end of many verses an alternative word is supplied for words that often don't need it, and these definitions are so sub-standard that they fall below what could be found in a modern translation. I found them very distracting."
3,Image deceiving,"Not as professional-looking as it does on the picture... Looks almost like a toy... However, it is still very nice and unique. The sellers are quick and efficient when they work, both shipping and questions."
5,What's the difference besides price?,"The price included shipping and was dirt cheap. The product was not. I love being able to get it for such a great price, no shipping and no tax. It is a no brainer - buy it."
5,Works well,"IT does exactly as it's supposed to, aluminum material not plastic. Transitions a 55mm filter to a 52 mm lens."
5,Spring Equinox,"track listing is as follows :1. Moon's Milk2. Or Under An Unquiet Skullfirst release in the equinox solstice series. very beautiful, creative, flowing music. more abstract in structure than the other three, but definitely worth a listen. two eight minute songs form the best unknown artists ever known."
3,Very minimalistic.,"This limited edition CD, released for the Spring Equinox and deleted upon the arrival of the Summer Solstice, is not for the beginner Coil fan; although, if you think you're a potential fan, you may want to grab this while you still can."
3,Too brief to be of use for anyone serious on Bible study.,"This is an abridged version of the Expositor's Bible Commentary, which to start with is already too brief and too unsubstantiating in its comments on the Biblical texts. After abridgement, it is worse!"
2,Misses the mark,"Mr. Reichheld has impressive credentials and I respect his intentions, yet in this book he recommends using poorly-developed surveys to understand customer or employee loyalty. That's extremely misleading! That process and the results gained will only mislead management and will not truly indicate how loyal customers or employees really are. The only true way to understand and manage customer or employee loyalty is to talk to them and let them express their own thoughts! Mr. Reichheld has missed the mark."
3,"Interesting and Useful, Not Trail-Blazing","Despite having the greatest respect for Mr. Reichheld, who is a true innovator and pioneer in the field of customer loyalty, much of the book content is principally an amplification and/or extension of material already available, or presented, elsewhere. Study results helped to provide a foundation, and sense of dimension, for the ideas and concepts. Examples of companies which apply a holistic approach to customer loyalty was also noteworthy."
3,Decent if you have experience with staining,"I was originally trying to order the full, but accidentally ordered the twin because of a problem with the browser. There was no tracking sent and didn't expect the huge shipment to arrive when it did. It's solid, but the wood is splintered in some areas and looks like somebody did some wood patching on it. Seller was fast and helpful in sending the Full size, but overall experience was a pain."
1,Room Doctor? Keep looking...,"This bed was exactly what I was looking for: simple, solid wood construction, reasonable price. I bought a twin bed and matching trundle from Room Doctor, and wish I hadn't. It took numerous phone calls and emails over two months to get my items delivered. Once I received them, several of the main structural boards had substantial splits right. It was another nightmare waiting for the parts to be replaced. Once assembled, one of the legs cracked as we were positioning the bed in the room (without even a mattress on it!).I'll be using this bed as a $120 template to cut my own solid wood pieces. The pine they ship is just too fragile to hold a person's weight, and its not worth dealing with Room Doctor for replacements."
4,Easy to put together...thank God!,Not a bad furnature and very easy to assemble. The price was good. I will be looking into other items from this copany. I gave it a 4 because one of the legs had a big knott hole I had to repair..over all I like the product.
4,Solid,"This is a great bed for the price- solid wood and tightly constructed. Finishing it was before assembling was easy, especially due to the simple design. And putting it together took about 10 minutes. I did sand the edges a little before finishing. I am a little bit concerned the slats might break if our child jumps on the bed. So far she's only done that a couple times (that I know of) and no broken slats.Another nice feature is the height of the bed is perfect for our plastic storage containers to fit underneath."
5,Easy to assemble & great looking,"I can't say enough good things about this frame. I like to sleep higher off the ground and this definitely is nice and high. Because of this there is plenty of space for storage underneath. The frame is really sturdy and was extremely easy to assemble. I think it probably took about 25 minutes to put together. I really don't understand how anyone had problems with putting it together. I haven't stained it yet, but I can tell the pine is going to take the stain very well. I slept on it last night and it gave great support to my mattress. It's also really easy to disassemble for when I move again. Plus I got the package about 3 days earlier than I thought I would. All in all I am extremely satisfied with this purchase."
3,Good for the price,"It was easy to put together and is pretty solid. The only downside is the center support running the length of the bed. It is very inadequate for this size bed (queen) and needs to be much sturdier. Weight on the bed causes the center to sag. I fixed this by simply putting a crate under the center support to keep it from sagging. I just used what I had on hand and it fit snuggly under the center support, but a cut-to-fit 2x4 or something similar would work great as well. The other thing I don't like is that the mattress is not secured on the frame since the frame sides are flush so there is nothing to hold the mattress in place. This is not a big deal really, but different from something like a This-End-Up platform bed in which the frame creates a shallow box for the mattress to fit in. A headboard would be a nice option to have, but making one would not be that hard."
5,Bed broke after 1 year of use...but they are sending me new parts,"I bought this bed frame about 1 year ago, and just the other day it completely broke. The wood part the attaches to the screws broke open. I wasn't expecting this bed to last a lifetime, but I expected more than 1 year of use. I'm not sure if I received a faulty bed, or if the quality of the bed is just bad, but I would not recommend this product to other people.After I wrote the above review, I called the company, and it turns out they have a 10 year warranty. They are going to send me new parts to fix my bed. I could not be happier with the wonderful customer service I received from them. Even though the bed broke, I would recommend this product to others."
5,Great bed for temporary housing!,"I bought this bed to use when I moved into an apartment for a short-term lease and needed something that was easy to move. It comes unassembled as really just a few planks of wood in two long boxes. As a 100-lb girl, I was able to put it together myself in no time. It's extremely sturdy, doesn't squeak or rock, and is tall enough to fit Xerox boxes underneath for storage. When it came time to move, I could easily disassemble it, pack it up, and move it myself! It also takes up very little storage space while I'm not using it. When the bed is made with a traditional comforter, the only wood you can see is the legs, so it really fits with any decor. I'm considering buying a larger size in the future to use permanently. Overall, a fantastic buy and a great product!"
2,bed isnt really the best deal,"i bought this bed for my 6 year old and thought we would have fun painting it.. just like the 1 star review which i didnt see at the time.. yes, splinters are very very possible. anyway, my son didn't sleep in this bed that much when one of the pieces of wood which go down the center broke, then another.. the frame is fine but the middle not so good.. i think i would have been better off for the money having just bought the box spring then having gone this route.."
5,Excellent Bed frame,"I love my platform beds that I have purchased from room doctor thru Amazon. I have purchased a queen and a king size, both were made with good quality wood without knots, and I stained both with no problems. I highly recomend platform beds from The Room Doctor"
3,A textbook instead of a tour guide,"I bought this book before my 2nd time to Chicago. When I read the introduction of the book at Amazon.com, I thought it would be useful as the tour guide to the river tour in Chicago. However, I found it is useless for the travelers who would like to take the ship and enjoy the time on the Chicago River as the scene in 'My Best Friend's Wedding'. This book is good if you are interested in the history, geography, architecture and any other things about the Chicago River. On the other hand, if you want to be a lazy traveler who only wanna enjoy the sights and the atmosphere on the river, just throw this book away and open your eyes to see the beautiful things around."
5,For the absolute beginner,"Its a school textbook, not sure which grade.For someone like me with absolutely no experience in programming it is a good book. I want to start working with microcontrollers and before investing too much money in harware I wanted to get some experience in programming. This book starts out doing very basic programs but advances thru more difficult problems but in a way where you build upon what you have learned in the previous section....Like I said before its a school textbook.I have used this book with the free BASIC program at Liberty Basic....you can google Liberty Basic for their free program which is very easy to use."
4,Vacuum bags fit,This was an easy way for me to re-supply and be sure I was getting the right bag/fit for my canister vacuum. Very simple and with my prime trial membership 2-day shipping got it to my house as quickly as I could get to store.
4,vacuum bags are vacuum bags,"they do the trick. they did arrive quickly, and it's much easier to order online than trying to find them in the store!"
4,Great Sophmore Album,"I prefer this one over their debut but it's a bit expensive. My personal favorite tracks would be Living My Life, Why Worry, Wild Horses, and Weeping Willows. If you have the extra money and like poppish, r&b trancey type of tunes then this would be a good buy."
4,Silver for Sylver,"Sylver are a great trance/dance band from Belgium.The stand-out tracks on Little Things for me are:Livin' My Life, Why Worry, Shallow Water, Confused, and Weeping Willows.Silvie's voice is angelic. The music is great. Although the hip-hop sound on ""Confused"" is a bit confusing, but somehow works.The bonus disc with dvd videos of Livin' My Life & Why Worry and extras is great.The bonus remixes are excellent, especially the Noemi remix of Why Worry and CJ Stone remix of Confused.I highly recommend this cd."
4,"Sylver ""Little Things","I'm a big fan of Sylver, I love all of theirs CD's. They just has a great music for me, never get bored with it."
5,Shimmering and Pulsing,"I couldn't bear to see this CD get 3 out of 5 starts only because it was reviewed by one person. From start to finish this CD is gorgeous, and much too short. If you dig Dif Juz or Labradford then you'll really dig this CD. It was really refreshing to finally hear something like this...moody, dark, pulsing, but shimmering at the same time."
3,Murky echoing dark melodies,"Will appeal, at least to some. After having seen this trio play in Glasgow in support for Porcupine Tree, I was impressed at the sounds they manage to extract from their three bass guitars. This album expands on this setup but still maintains the same minimalist feel and is bass-guitar oriented. I would call it ambient rock, with the emphasis on the ambient. Melodies are dark, murky reverberating like stalagmites. Best played in dark environment, or in a cave."
3,Continuous problems,"Despite this watch being ""water resistant"" (I think to 10 feet), the slightest amount of moisture kills it. We have gone through two already, and are very disappointed. Don't listen to the Timex mantra of ""Takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'..."" One lick and the tick stops. Very disappointing."
2,Low effective distance & constant dropping of signals,"Its manual says 3ft the maximum distance between the watch and the strap. That's not true. Would I wear the watch on my wrist and extend my arms, it would stop working right there, and no, I do not have 3ft arms. The sensor also has to be _very_ wet to work properly, i.e. if you are not heavily working out, this piece is gonna go sleeping in minutes as the water evaporates. It is a silly and useless design overall.I gave it 2 stars because sometimes it worked okay, like when I put my arms crossed in front of my chest, with a dripping sensor on."
2,"Nice Photos, Nothing Else.","To be to the point, do not buy this DVD. All it has going for it is some nice photographs and photography of the ship today. There are so many factual inacuracies in the interviews that I pondered weather or not I could get my money back a third of the way through. If you must have this, watch it without the sound turned on. Better yet buy some books on the Queen Mary. If the Queen is somthing you know about you will regret this purchase"
4,Gift for my 2 year old,He loves it. This helps him with his balance and by the time he is three I think he will be an expert!
5,cheryl g,"Fast service,although all the nuts and bolts were not in package,we had to use our own. It is a good sturdy and safe scooter now that my 3 year old nephew can ride it.Hes having a blast!"
3,sturdy but small,"A good product. I got it for my 4 year olds birthday. He is taller for his age and the handle bars don't go high enough for him without him bending over. I have seen others that have taller handle bars that he rides more comfortably. (radio flyer, John Deere)."
4,Nice Toy - Recommended for busy-little-bodies.,My son loves this scooter - I just wish the handle bars were a bit taller. It's adjustable but my son is a little taller than average.
2,Age Inappropriate,"The suggested age range is ""5 and up"", but the maximum weight is 44 lbs! The ""average"" 5 yr old boy is already 40lbs (50th percentile). Most 5-6 year olds will be too heavy for this item, or will rapidly outgrow it -- so the manufacturer's suggested age range of ""5 and up"" is very misleading. The scooter is also very small. They should provide all the weight/height and other limits for the toys rather than just age ranges -- which in this case were very misleading. (I got this item for my nephew who is 4 yrs 9 months old, and he is already too heavy for it at 45 lbs.) Also, forget about telling me the BOX size and give me the SCOOTER'S measurments. It would have saved me a lot of hassle and disappointment."
1,NOT durable,"Be warned. This product is prone to break around the rear axle housing which is made of PLASTIC. So you have a steel rod running through a plastic tube. Guess what happens when the steel tube hits the plastic?This was given to my son for Christmas. He is 3.Day 1 of scooter riding: Plastic endcaps on handles(blue endcaps) break very easily. He did not abuse the scooter, pieces of plastic just started chipping off. Not a critical part so I disregarded.Day 2: Back axel housing is plastic. Broke from the scooter falling from about 2 feet onto the pavement. 2 feet!? And it landed on its wheels! Now the axel on the left side floats around because it's plastic housing is gaping wide open. The whole deck now has a tilt to the left.My son doesn't care because he doesn't know any better. But I do. Other than the scooter breaking easily, it's great. Maybe this should be classified as an ""Indoor Preschool Scooter."""
2,Breaks easily,My three year old son used this for about a week before it broke. The casing that holds the rear axle in place broke and causes the wheels to wobble excessively while in use. I'm looking to replace the casings with bearings- something that should have come standard.
4,Works well for the price,"This tape really is a great value for the money. It's definitely not Micropore, but it does work well. When I unrolled the first bit from the first roll I was coming straight from using Micropore and this tape felt rather stiff. In the end, that hasn't been an issue at all. The adhesive sticks well and I haven't had any problems with it coming off. If we ever run out (this is 6 rolls, remember) I'd definitely buy it again because it costs so much less than Micropore."
5,Great swing music,"I love this album. Great acoustic sound. I can listen to it in the car and drive across the country. It is so easy to listen to. I love the mixture of standard swing in the style of Django Reinhardt, and the original compositions. I highly recommend this album."
2,interesting but too light,"As a newcomer to America there's lots of trivia I don't know about but am exposed to every day, so anything which lists the things Americans take for granted is useful. This book is amusing and a bit informative, though the subjects are in the main so well known that there's nothing new to be learned.By its very nature this has to be a light book with brief one paragraph descriptions for most things, so sometimes an item which is worth more detail or possibly a book of its own is under represented.All in all it's like reading the small filler articles in a magazine (it's published by Readers Digest), interesting to spend a couple of minutes dipping into but nothing you'd read from cover to cover or use as a reference book."
5,Treasure Trove,I love this book because it presents me with a better understanding and insight about the things I encounter in the American culture on a regular basis.
5,Excellent Workout,This is a fun and challenging workout. I love the music and dancing; it keeps you motivated and excited to workout. This keeps my interest because it's more like a dance class; it's not like those other boring workouts. This is definitely a favorite of mine. I will purchase Shaun T's other dvds.
3,Good fun but it doesn't replace old fashion crunches and weight lifting,"The moves are fun and will shock the muscles with some tightness, but it is not a replacement for old fashion abs crunches and diet. Quite simply, there is nothing magic in this program."
3,Not for beginners,Not for beginners. I used it twice and lost interest. I don't think exercise videos are for me.
1,Don't waste your money,"Advertising for this is pure unrealistic, this was boring and I'm glad I didn't pay full price..it wasn't worth it"
4,Fun workout video!,Love the beachbody products. This is a little different than the first series but not too much. It was fun and provides a twist to the first video series.
5,Great Dvd,"i love this work out DVD. i just stared 2 weeks ago. First, it was really hard for me to keep up with that DVD. Now it is really easy and i can see my difference."
1,hip hop abs,"The DVD appears to have been a copy and not an original. I feel like I was mislead, I assumed that it would an original."
1,waste of money,I would have given it no stars if I could have. This is so far from hip hop. The instructor uses the same moves. The instructor has a very annoying voice. The dancers were too over the top and to be honest this dvd bored me.
1,Horrible!!,I bought this item hoping it would help me but it doesnt even work. Both disc wouldnt play for me so I really dont know if this is a good workout or not
4,great workout!,"This is an excellent workout...especially the 45 minute workout! It's fun, but you know you're getting into shape while you're doing it! I'd recommend this to anyone. There is also a low impact that is just as effective if you need that."
3,"Not bad, a bit high in protein (min 45%)","Got this before I knew about NLS cichlid pellets, but the price wasn't too bad. If you have smaller cichlids, the pellets will break up into crumbs and make your tank look dirty. A bit high in min. crude protein at 45%. African cichlids won't do well if this is main diet, can cause ""bloat"" with too much consumption."
3,Decent product - but incorrect picture shown,"I ordered this item partly based on its packaging - I really liked the tin the image made it look like it came in. I wanted to include one of the tins as part of a gift, b/c it would look nice w/ the other gift items I will be giving. However, the image of the lid was completely off - the design is different, & it is an unattractive dark brown color. Otherwise, the item is as described, & it tastes good. However, I am disappointed, b/c as I said, I wanted the item as much for the tin it came in as for its contents. As far as the actual rimmer, the same effect & taste could be achieved (& for much cheaper) by crushing up candy canes, & swirling the rim of the glass in that."
1,"Exploitative, Ignorant, and Racist","The only reason to read this book is to play the Sharon Caulder drinking game. The rules are simple. Take one shot every time she says:- How sexy and irresistible she is- How backwards Africans are- How she refuses to conform to an aspect of the very religion she is initiating into- How she is really African, but smarter- How Africans look up to her- How she has magic powers but can't bother to prove it- How she does something super offensive to the locals but won't apologizeAcademics' bonus: Two shots when she gets something fundamentally wrong about the region and/or religious tradition.**Warning - you'll be sloshed by the end of the first chapter.**"
4,A journey to magic discovery,"From the first page to the last MARK OF VOODOO introduce you to the deep mistery of Voodoo magic. The intensity of rituals well explained could really make it fell that you were there. Horrific, informative, one of the best book about africa's secret rituals."
5,Constructing a Life,"Mark of Voodoo is many magnificent books in one: an accessible introduction to the religion of voodoo, a fascinating travelogue of an adventure in Africa, a compelling and passionate love story, a gripping account of a personal odyssey, and most importantly I think, a model of how to construct a life. Beautifully written, this captivating book challenges us all to make conscious, ethical, thoughtful choices about the lives we lead. Caulder, who forthrightly shares with us her own extraordinary awakening to her African heritage, implicitly asks us to explore our own pasts in light of the people we want to be."
4,"Very questionable ""facts"", but a great read","This book is very interesting, and well-written. I don't know much about voodoo, but some of the things in this book are quite shocking and I would say quite a bit like something Hollywood would like to get a hold of. The author's truthfulness is questionable. She states she levitates and sees auras, etc. Some people believe that. If you can levitate inside your body, then maybe you should call up the author and y'all can have a nice chat about it. Although, I doubt anyone reading this can. In short..., it's very interesting and quite questionable. The fact that it's played off as nonfiction reminds me of a somewhat recently famous author that got in trouble with Oprah Winfrey for making up his ""true"" story. But who am I to say? Could be nonfiction."
2,Does not work,Pronto Plus is a waste of your money. It does not kill the lice nor does it remove the nits.
2,Disappointing,As others have mentioned (and I ignored) this movie is boring.Not up to the 'Shrek' movies standards. This movie does not draw you in so that you care what happens to any of the characters. Though full of action it goes no where & you are left feeling you just wasted your money & more importantly your time.
2,not funny,"My wife and I did not like this movie, we found it not funny and slow. We both fell asleep through certain points and I never do this. Some people might like it but we did not."
2,Not much of a movie,"We watched this at home, in 2D. This is clearly a movie that relies on the 3D effect. Without it, it is not much of a film. It was fine; nothing more."
3,Another Disney Rip Off,"Dreamworks Animation is good at one thing: Ripping off Disney.Check out the classic ""Mickey & The Beanstalk.""The premise of going into the land of Jack and the Beanstalk is strange for Puss. But the idea was done by Disney in the 1940's. Dreamworks is running out of great Disney films to ""borrow"".Shrek, Dreamworks' only successful animated movie is blatant thievery, stealing characters made icons by Disney.Meanwhile Disney/Pixar continues to crank out classic animated features year after year.Dreamworks is The Monkees of animation."
3,It's more for kids,"It's more for kids than adults, so writing a review seems weird. My daughter seemed to like it more than some videos, but less than Shrek or Despicable Me."
3,so/so,"was alittle disappointed,given how much i love this chrecter in the shrek movies.maybe some charecters just should stay as ""supporting""role."
3,Puss in Boots DVD,"""Puss in Boots"" was okay and would probably be enjoyed more by children than by adults. Featuring the Egg as a major character just didn't fit the script and was rather dumb, we thought. Then making the Egg untrustworthy fit the scenario even less."
3,It's not great.,This DVD was disappointing.The movie did not live up to the hype. The 3D effects were just average and the story line was weak.
3,Silly Fun,"My favorite scene was the dance off with the cats. Absolutely hated the ending for Humpty Dumpty. He was a bad egg. ""Ooo,"" says the cat with paw over mouth. Best non-liner ever."
3,It was just ok,"I was expecting a lot more from this movie...the previews were funnier than the movie itself. It did have a few laugh out loud parts but this would be a good movie for young children, not so much for adults. The plot was weird and didn't really make sense.. I was going off of a Shrek expectation on adult humor."
1,Disappointment,"The CD was blank. There were instructions on how to download it on my mac, but they didn't work. We had three people try to help me do it, all in IT at different places including Apple, and it didn't work. We got our money back, and the company paid the return postage to. This happens sometimes, but i REALLY wanted this movie as it's one of my faves. I will get it again later, when i get money for it."
5,Cute G rated fun,"DVD children and adults can watch with out foul language, or other hard topics, a good movie dvd, i liked it"
1,defective english track on 3D disc,1st purchase of 3 disc 3D blu ray disc netted black screen with sound track. Other 2 discs fine. Confirmed it was Englsh version of disc as French played fine on computer with bluray player. played another 3D disc on TV blu ray player. Returned to Amazon and paid for another disc until Amazon received 1st disc. 2 days later 2nd arrived and same issue - black screen with sound no picture. If you buy this product & have same issue - don't waste your time troubleshooting - Advised Amazon of multiple deective discs.
1,Prime didn't work,"I downloaded movie to Cloud, paid for it. Attempted to download to K Fire, have downloaded movies previously, but Puss and Boots disappeared. Same thing just happened to ""A Week With Marilyn"". Wasted six bucks."
1,This sucks get with times I want to rent this online,Whos cage do we have to rattle I dont want to drive to the store and rent this not like theres to many blockbusters left
1,PUSS - stick to shrek,"I was so looking forward to this film. I actually waited until Thanksgiving to see it. I was so horrendously disappointed, I can't believe the people who left these 4 & 5 star reviews were awake for this film. Puss starts life out @ a boarding school where humpty dumpty is his best friend. He then grows up going on a quest for the magic beans from the Jack & the Beanstalk story. It gets even weirder when a very neanderthalish (billy bob thorton) starts after him after he steals the magic beans. It is the biggest mess of an animated feature imaginable. Makes you wonder, what the writers/directors were on. couldn't be good pot, it would have been a much better story. Selma Hayaks character sadly didn't help this story at all.In the Shrek films Puss is so awesome, cute and funny - nothing at all like this snoozer."
1,Boring Movie,This movie was such a great disappointment. Boring and pointless. Stupid story line with lots of double crosses. Save your money.
4,Animated fun.,"An infamous cat befriends a female, and meets up with an old friend, an egg, sort a Humpty Dumpty. Together, they try to steal a goose who lays golden eggs, for reasons of enrichment, revenge or redemption. The Puss in Boots character is funny and very likeable. This is standard animated fare, but the animation is excellent, and the film is clever, funny and will be fun for the whole family to watch. This one does not rank with the terrific animated movies of recent years, but is certainly one that you should take the kids to see, as everyone will enjoy it."
4,Successful Shrek spinoff,"Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) teams up with his estranged childhood friend Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) and a female rogue named Kitty Soft Paws (Salma Hayek) to steal the magic beans from Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris) so they can climb the beanstalk to the Giant's castle, where riches presumably await them.The character of Puss In Boots was a consistent scene stealer in the Shrek films, so it was natural to give him the spotlight. I'm glad director Chris Miller and his screenwriters (William Davies, Brian Lynch, and Tom Wheeler) crafted a film that was worthy of him. It continues the Shrek tradition of mashing fairy tales together while turning them on their heads, producing memorable characters and lots of funny moments. Much of the comedy is drawn from Puss's Latin lover personality and lampooning actual feline behavior. Very funny and cute."
5,excellent,"Recommended, great fun for every family , and enjoy the 3D effects and Hd images , funny characters , My kids love this movie"
5,Entertaining for the Whole Family: Kids Loved It,My kids loved this movie. My oldest (6) wanted to rate it like we do on NetFlix and asked that we give it 5 stars. I thought it was a very good movie too. So did my wife - entertaining for all of us.
3,Not a cute as I expected!,"I had heard lots about this movie and expected it to be as cute as the Shrek and other animated ones, but it was just OK. Worth renting, but not worth buying!"
2,Disappointing,"My 5 year old son liked it, but us adults were quite bored. I expected more From the makers of Shrek. I guess sometimes it's best to keep the side characters on the side and not make features about them. Donkey would have been a better choice, as at least he has a personality beyond machismo. It's an OK movie, but wasn't reallywhat we expected from all of the hype. It won'tbe one we play again... We'll pass it on to a friend now that we've watched it."
2,A story with no direction.,"The opening graphics came close to having that Rango quality and feel but rapidly declined from that point onward. Probably because they either couldn't sustain the creative energy or they saw how expensive it is to sustain that level. The script tried to mix in too many fairy tales and ended up making them all mediocre and shallow. Good egg, bad egg was just as bland in CGI as it was in character. The gosling laying huge gold eggs in massive numbers besides seeming weird would certainly be a neat biological trick for a baby goose. Add all that high density gold and you have a golden egg laying goose that didn't visually make sense. Also,ho-hum predictable was the stereotyped feline love interest. Character voice choices were OK but then they are well practiced at that by now. Finally, the humor and dialogue sounded Saturday morning cartoon bland. It all sounded like the script people simply used the decades old Disney guide book ""Jokes for Dummies""."
2,Puss in Boots,"I really loved Puss in Boots in Shrek...and I was so looking forward to this movie.However, it was not as good as I had thought, sadly it was not as funny as I had originally thought either...Too bad...but I still love Puss in Boots the character^^"
4,Our kids can't get enough of this.,Puss in Boots (Two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)Pre-order in place. This should keep our kids busy on road trips. The movie was completely absurd and hilarious. My wife is a real cat person and we watched it in 3D. Whole family loved it tons. I would even go as far as to say the choreography was really quite entertaining. Well produced kids movie that is really quite watchable by all ages.
5,I love cats and cartoons,"I enjoyed this movie. I am a big kid and I love cats, especially Puss in Boots. I have all the Shrek movies and I had to get this movie to add to my collection. I loved the price, plus It came with DVD, Blue-ray and Digital copy."
4,Who Doesn't Like Antonio Bandaras,More from the Shrek team the kids'll like it. Just enough between the lines to keep adults entertained. Not an academy award winner but enjoyable. Watched it with a couple different kids to good reviews
1,Wow...it was that bad,This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen even my five year old sister wanted me to leave the theatre and she likes every thing.Really a waste of money.
1,Another terrible cat movie. Yawwwn!,"Let's start with the blasphemy voice acting, shall we? I would state that Obama sounds more serious reading off of the teleprompter than half of the cast in this film can be taken seriously. Cinematography is average so I can't complain too much about that; lighting is great. Animations can best be described as if looking at a washed out-modern art picture in a museum that charges a quarter for admission. Story is pretty lame. Soundtrack is a mixed bag though edited flawlessly. One other movie not even I would recommend to children... they would probably enjoy playing with keys or coins than watch this underwhelming film."
3,"Good Movie, very slow performance","The movie was great. My kids loved it. We had to completely stop it 2-3 times to get it to play again. It acted like it was buffering, but would start back up as soon as we stopped and restarted it."
5,puss in boots,"puss in boots what a graet movie very funny, action plus, liked it a lot, very well done, good story."
4,7.1 not in 3D version,"7.1 dolby true hd sound is not working on the 3d version ,only on the regular bluray disc , it is on the menu but when you select it you only get 5.1, everything else is excellent, Oscar Winner!, I am giving 4 stars only because the sound matters to me , I will update my review if i found out It's a factory defect."
2,"Sorta cute, but mostly boring and long.","The Puss in Boots character was my favorite thing in the Shrek franchise. I enjoyed about the first 30 minutes, but the rest of the movie was a pointless drag. This was overly long, and the plot was boring. Jack, Jill, and especially Humpty Dumpty were creepy and unpleasant characters. It was fun when Puss was doing silly cat things, but that only added up to about 10 minutes."
5,Kids like this more than the Shrek movies,My children tell me that they enjoyed this movie more than the Shrek movies. It's clever and funny for the whole family. We were very entertained by it.
5,"Great movie, great quality",Video and audio of this disc is perfect. The movie itself is also great. It was first to be a direct to video release. Good thing they reconsidered. A must if you like the first two Shrek movies.
3,Puss in Boots Review,"Puss in Boots was okay, but it was nowhere near as good as Shrek. There were some parts where I giggled, but overall, this movie seemed a little more serious than funny."
5,Funny Film and Great in 3D,"Hi All,Puss in Boots is a very funny film for both adults and children a like. My 9 and 12 year old boys thought is was very funny as did my 75-80 odd year old parents. Great movie and excellent in 3D.Cheers."
1,Warning It's Boring Boring Boring,"My sister & I saw the trailers months ago & couldn't wait for the DVD release. Wow, the trailer is very misleading. It is soooo boring, long & unimaginative. Only one short scene is funny, i.e., a ""Dance Fight"" scene. The rest is a very long hodgepodge of scenes involving humpty dumpty, jack & the beanstalk, and the goose that lays golden eggs. Bits of these fairy tales are haphazardly mixed together with no real story or direction. We were so bored & agreed that even when we were kids we would not have liked this over rated & over pricedPuss in Boots (Two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)""cartoon""."
1,pretty bad,"The story line is not for young kids and not interesting for adults, it is creepy and dark. Did not enjoy at all."
1,so disapointed,I too was looking forward to seeing this movie unfortunately the previews were the only good parts of the movie. my grandson who loved the Shrek movies was as bored as I was. I never write reviews but just had to throw my two cents in because the high percent of ratings is why I bought this clunker I will pay more attention to all the reviews in the future live and learn
1,Wrong item!,"Purchased and paid for what was advertised as Puss and Boots, for my 3 small children to watch on movie night during our vacation. We all sat down ready for a nice family night, to find that we had been sent the wrong movie! The puss and boots short had been placed in the puss and boots movie case. My children were so disappointed and I was extremely annoyed. I would never use this seller again."
1,Waste of time (and some cash),"I am very glad that I did not actually purchase this - just rented it. This is one of the most tasteless, meaningless and talent-less production that I have seen recently... I am not sure what the target audience of this movie is, but after watching it, I would conclude that it sits somewhere between anime and I don't know what - fans ... I could not believe Banderas and Hayek actually participated in this!"
1,Terrable kids movie....first 15 minutes were not even good.,"Find something different. Not work the money. With movies like toy story, shreck, and any pixar film....this movie remains forever at the bottom of both mine and my daughter's list."
5,Puss in Boots,I just love this movie and got it for the whole family and the grandkids just love puss in boots i really hope they do a part 2 and the diablos were just as good....I LOVE IT
4,Cats,I thought the movie Puss n Boots was delightful. I'm a cat lover and always like movies about cats. It's nice to have a movie about a cat.
4,Egg-celent.,"This movie tells the story of the much loved Puss. We learn that as a child growing up in an orphanage, he becomes best friends with Humpty Dumpty. Together, the two youths fall into trouble, but it seems that Humpty will never be able to shake that life. Fast forward a number of years, and Humpty runs into Puss again. This time he's got the ultimate scheme, to steal the Golden Goose from the Giant (of Jack and the Beanstalk). Humpty convinces Puss to sign on to the idea, and the two go after the Golden Goose.This is your typical Dreamworks film. The cinematography is stunning, the landscapes never better. The humor is very strong, although there are a couple lines that (in my opinion) are a little too crude for children 6 and under. The puns are great, and the movie is laced with them. The only thing that I felt it was missing was how Puss got linked up with Shrek. All-in-all, though, this was a very good film."
4,"Enjoyable for Whole Family, Not as Funny As Shrek Though","My whole family really enjoyed this movie, and it is action-packed, so there's no question of boredom. It centers on Puss in Boots, the character Antoinio Banderas made famous in the Shrek movies. A friend/nemesis from his past (Humpty-Dumpty) re-enters his life, along with a new romantic interest played by Selma Hayak, and they attempt to steal a goose that lays golden eggs. Like Shrek, it's full of fairy-tale references and 'inside' jokes that play more to adults than kids, although kids love the action. I didn't find it quite as funny as the Shrek movies though - maybe because there's no Eddie Murphy/donkey sidekick to lighten things up. Certain parts were also a little mean-spirited - lots of fighting in this movie. But other than that, it's very enjoyable and well-executed family fare."
3,Okay,"The movie was a little less than I expected. It was not the actors, it was the story itself. If you watch it on streaming, you have probably seen as much as you want."
4,Kitty tale,"A funny story of stealing ones' possessions to become rich while deceiving and cheating on each other, presenting victims as creatures not worthy to live, and sharing some fraction of wealth obtained illegally with commoners making de-facto them co-participating in a crime such legalised somehow by, sounds and looks as a very English folk story.If not approaching from the very roots of deeds pictured, it is a funny family movie with great computing effects impressive in the modern cinema theatre a film was watched at."
4,Puss In Boots is no BOO!,"I think the creators did a wonderful job in developing the plot of the movie Puss In Boots. Oh, it doesn't follow the book, but it does appeal to 10-years old on up, especially with the addition of nursery rhyme charaters -- Humpty Dumpty -- for example. There wasn't a need, in MHO, to add the risque' moment. I did like the movie."
4,Funny movie,"I like to watch anmination movie and I think the story was very good and funny, for the whole family."
3,Not as funny,"Wasn't too sure about this spin off, but got it anywhere. Not as funny or as creative, I actually fell asleep while watching it, maybe because of the 3D? which, is not fantastic either. A OK movie, no need in 3D."
3,Pretty good,"Dreamworks is always good stuff.This movie was pretty good. Decent story line. Just a nice, solid movie. Not the best movie I have seen, but I enjoyed watching it."
2,Not worth a cent it's a very boring and not done well either!,It's a really boring and stupid movie! I was exspecting it. To be cute and not Tht good of a movie but it was like really stupid and it wasn't cute either also very predictable
5,great video,"this movie was very cute and entertaining for ""kids of ALL ages--I enjoyed it and I am a BIG kid""I was very pleased with my purchase as always from AMAZON and am currently waiting on another gift card so I can purchase from this vender again!!"
1,BORING!,"We hated this movie.... We were told that this movie was good, but NO WAY. BORING, don't waste your time"
5,Great movies can't wait to view in 3D from the sofa,"Really good flick, but I always enjoy more at home on the sofa. Looking forward to watching in 3D from home. The combo packs are the best way to go."
4,i like this movie,i really enjoy this movie....it has a really good story line worth 4 bucks if u got time check it out....
2,Ehhh,"I'm so glad we watched this on demand before ordering a DVD of the movie. We loved the Puss character in the Shrek movies, but this movie had such a wierd plot that it was a poor vehicle for what should have been a movie that allowed Puss to show his sassiness and confidence much more. There were only a few short scenes that even gave a hint of the Puss we saw in Shrek. And at least in the Shrek movies, the plot didn't suddenly insert a sicene that made you say, ""Where did his horse come from??"" Rent it - don't buy it!"
2,Puss n Boots Blue Ray 3D,"I bought this because my Wife and I bought a new 3D TV and we both enjoy good animated movies.We loved Beauty and The Beast 3D, The Lion King 3D, Cars 2 3D and many others.This movie we both thought was utterly stupid, very poor script, boring and just plain dumb.the 3D and animation were really very good but couldn't enjoy it because of the poor script.in my opinion it would be a waste of money even at $10.00. It was just not fun unless i guessyou are a small kid."
2,Hope the grandkids like it - way to shallow for entertaining adults,"Let me preface this by saying I really like movies regardless of genre'. I am a big fan of animated and 3D movies (if a movie is both - that's a bonus). That all having been said I thought that this movie fell flat from the very beginning (I liked the first couple of Shrek films). If I weren't multi-tasking when this was on I would have played something else instead. I thought the movie was way too superficial and non-engaging for adult audiences. I hope the grandkids like it. The only real redeeming quality it has is that it's 3D, but that alone won't get me to watch it again."
2,OK Movie,"Really not what I thought it would be! I was expecting more than what I received, and it was very disappointing."
5,Puss n' Boots,"Puss In BootsFun movie family can watch with a bowl of popcorn! Will give you a chuckle along the way!,,"
4,Worth the Price,"Two and a half hours of sweet, soul music. These are songs of love and lust, betrayal and trust. Although every one was originally recorded by someone else, Price makes each one his own as he sings with the conviction of a man who has been there. Of course he does that on all his CDs. What makes this distinctive is, like all live albums, it allows us to recapture a specific moment in time. We get to sense firsthand Price's easy rapport with both his band and his audience. We get to hear the priceless (or should we say Priceful) little nuances, a soulful sigh, a lecherous chortle. And we get to hear Price's tight and terrific band stretch out, allowing each member to, at one time or another, take center stage. We particularly love those Memphis-style horns. This is an album of funk and fun. Easily worth the Price."
3,just practice problems,"Good for practice review, doesn't have any examples, so may want to order a book to go with it. But overall good refresher."
3,Cover-roll Stretch,"I should have read the description more carefully when I ordered this. Compared with the 2"" X 10 yd size, this is way overpriced."
2,Not As Described,"When I went to use this product (as part of a dressing for my surgical wound) my nurse discovered that the roll was cut, and was only a yard and a quarter long instead of two yards. Although the company responded to my email complaining about this shortage, they wanted me to prove that I bought the roll and to send ""an image"". I didn't, deciding to let my poor review warn others."
4,Very Good Read!,"This book was thought -provoking, which warrants additional discussion. While most everyone who reads the book will be mostly interested with the main character, Aprielle, I found myself more interested in who Max was and what he could've achieved had he lived his life differently. The character development was well done. Considering other books I've read by first-time authors, this one is at the top of my list!"
4,I enjoyed the Read!!!,"Although, I'm a little torn about how the ""mother ruined her child?"" Every mother wants what is best for her children, and Aprielle was no different. Her method was a little overbearing, but none-the-less, it was in the best interest of her child.The characters were well developed, but I would have liked to know more about Maximillian life as opposed to his twin brother, Montgomery. Maybe told in Max's words as opposed to others. Like reading of Max's diary, perhaps?The story will definitely have you laughing out loud with Camille and Aprielle. LOL.I didn't particularly care for the abrupt ending about the reason Aprielle did what she did to her son, Max, as well as the confusion between Gabby and Rico's one-night stand. HUH?Overall rating: 4.0"
3,A Too Tall Tale Only Reasonably Told,"This was an interesting fable, just a little too over the top for my taste though for a novel. None of the characters were wholly believable because they were not well-developed enough--there was not enough information about them.It was rather like reading through the proposed script for a ""black night-time soap opera."" The most interesting part (though perhaps a litte too preachy) was the surviving twin's eulogy at the funeral.The overall story was interesting and dramatic, but had no real depth or impact because ultimately you did not care about the characters or their livesMichael Sainte-Andress"
3,Not up to par,"I'm planning a trip to southern Utah and was anxiously awaiting this video so that I could see what was in store for me. I was disappointed in this video, however. Besides the poor quality of the DVD itself, there were many blank (dark) spaces of varying lengths between chapters. The video did not flow well. There was adequate coverage of the geology of the area but inadequate coveraqe of the flora and fauna. There was bare minimal coverage of the actual sites to see. Much of this was done from an aerial view, which most of us will not be doing. It's almost like the scenery was covered just in passing. I'd save your money and buy some of the excellent books and guides available if I were you."
3,a little simple and amatuerish,This dvd was more simple than we had hoped and felt like a college project as opposed to professionally done informative work. It is pleasent but not what I had hoped for in a more comprehensive look at the park.
5,Llama Training is fun with this video!,"I have had a wild llama for three years that was a fight to get a hold of to do yearly shearing. She will now willingly walk on a lead with me, stand tied, and pick up her front feet. Previous years my husband and I would drag her to a post, she would lay down, and I would hand shear her. I am so glad I found this video because now we can be a team and work together to make things easier! I really think this is a good buy for new and old llama owners, it is so detailed and shows exactly how to catch and handle several ages of llamas. She does not even work with her own animals... These are llamas that have never seen her before. Its well worth the money!"
5,Stellar debut and the beginning of something brilliant...,"I picked up Elkland's CD at the Erasure show last night. They were the opening act, but I don't think it will be long until these guys are the main event! I was seriously impressed with their energy during their live performance. They had Massey Hall moving and were a little taken aback I think. So, during the intermission I picked up a copy(all of which sold out last night) and jammed to it all the way home!!! Stand-out tracks are: Apart, I Need You Tonight and We Share A Heart. Their sound is a little bit of The Cure, mashed in with some Duran Duran, a bleep and blip from New Order and the emergence of Martin Gore-styled Depeche Mode-esque lyrics. Any fan of neo-New Wave (or the original New Wave, from back in the day) will dig this album!!!"
1,"If you liked 'Apart', leave it at that","just buy the single. Don't go out and buy this whole album, it would be a waste of money. The songs just aren't good, plain and simple. Maybe if you like pointless beats and meaningless lyrics, this CD is for you. Don't let 'Apart' fool you like it did me, there's little else redeemable about this CD."
5,New Wave 80's now,"this is an entire album dedicated to the new wave of teh 80's. every song is packed with the lyric and the sound that flock of seagulls and the cure perfected 20 years ago. the retro songs are beautiful and catchy, and somewhat refreshing since the emo-core underground (ha, there is no emo-core underground, just high school kids emulating underoath and senses fail) is overpopulating the airwaves and web-space (listen to an alternative station or take a peek at purevolume)"
5,Outstanding Research Book,"I concur with the reader from San Francisco. I was lost until this book was assigned. Finally an author who doesn't ramble on for chapters without say anything. McNabb is to the point and explains quantitative and qualitative approaches with ease. This is what most students dream of. The book is excellent, even considering the typos and mispelled words.-2nd Year MPA, The Evergreen State College."
5,Does what I bought it for.,"Got this because it was at a great price compared to it's name brand counterpart, and I've bought and had good luck with this brand from some of the brick and mortar stores I've been in. There were'nt many reviews so I took a chance ordering online, and after almost a year of use I am very pleased with the performance of this product. I have an original nikon battery and the ultralast performs as well if not better than the original. Wish it could have been colored black to match the camera and original battery but this is minor, and you can't have everything. I'd recommend this battry to anyone on a budget."
2,For moodies only!,"This is a soundtrack to a national geographic documentary,not a moody blues albumn!I am a hardcore moody blues fan who purchases everything to support the group.If you love the MB's then this cd is great for a drive,housecleaning or to simply unwind.The production is at times choppy and the hayward/lodge originals for this session are at best mediocre."
1,Amazing Case of False Advertising,"I have been a Moody Blues Fan since the late 60's. There have been very few individual songs I would say I did not at least enjoy enough to give it 3-5 stars. However, this CD is NOT the Moody Blues. Yes, they did support the IMAX soundtrack and that is exactly what it is, an IMAX soundtrack. It may have been fitting in the movie, but it does nothing for the person sitting in their home or car listening. I'm offering my used CD for sale."
2,Nothing Great,"Based on other Reviews I thought I would give this a shot, I was not impressed by this CD ** or *** stars. Nothing on this CD moved me or made me happy I bought it. Enough said, I would roll the dice on something else."
3,Not the Moody Blues,"The music itself is good, but the CD is presented as a Moody Blues Music CD, which, it is not. This CD comes across as a Moody Blues meets Enya scrore, which, in it self is not bad, but as a Moody Blues fan and an Enya fan, I would rather have them seperate. I have seen the Moody's (2X) in New Orleans and their concerts are outstanding. The Music Industry has not given the Moody Blues the recognition they deserve.....also (on that note) if you don't like the Moody Blues music, it could be because your IQ is in the double or single digits.The Makings of a beautiful night......A Beautiful Woman at my side, A bottle of wine with glasses, bread and cheese and a CD of the Moody Blues in the stereo. Kind of like that beer ad...""IT DON'T GET NO BETTER!"""
4,Not as Good as Living Sea and Dolphins,Not having seen the film Amazing Caves I bought this soundtrack mostly because I love Steve Wood's soundtrack from The Living Sea and Dolphins. This soundtrack is vastly different in my view. It's certainly more majestic and powerful as opposed to the playful and tranquil sound of The Living Sea and Dolphins. There's also a Titanic influence in various sections of the music. Which is typical of the time period when everyone was Titanic crazy!While I feel The Living Sea and Dolphin soundtracks can stand on their own I feel Amazing Caves is better suited for film imagery. I hope Steve Wood produces another Caribbean-sounding album again!
4,An excellent sequel to Lord of the Rings (no mistake),Dennis McKiernan takes a few elements from Tolkien's Return of the King (Lord of the Rings vol 3) and creates a wonderful story. The names of characters and peoples are changed for the sake of copyright. Through my many re-readings of the Lord of the Rings I often wondered if the Dwarves were able to return to Moria. In the appendix of return of the King there is a tantalizing geneaology of Durin's line. Durin VII (and last) is listed and the reader wonders if this last Durin led his people back to Khazad Dum (Moria) after the fall of Sauron. This is the story of his battle to win back the home of his people. The horn presented by Eomer to Meriadoc is the key to the battle. While often criticized for emulating Tolkien I think this is a book that old J.R.R. would have written himself if he'd been given the time.
2,Tolkien,A sequel to Tolkien. Not much happens in this one. They head off for some caverns. Lots of travel. Get delayed by floods and storms. At the end they have a battle with a monster. Nothing real creative here.
4,Green Medicine,"This book is a must for anyone who wants to successfully grow herbs and harvest nature's bounty. It is laid out in a simple, straight forward manner; while the details are rich, the charts precise, the personal illustrations covering everything you need to know to get started. Tammi Hartung, medical herbalist, has done a thorough and insightful job of sharing her knowledge and passion for a greener world."
5,The Most Beautiful Score I've Ever Heard,"I heard excerpts of this score last week when Lee Holdridge was being interviewed on my local radio station. Usually I hear the music in the background without focusing on it. However, this caught my attention. I don't know if I have ever heard such a sensitive, beautifully written score in all of my life. I immediately went on Amazon and am listening to it now. I ordered Mr. Holdridge's other works and am awaiting their arrival. I also ordered the movie to see what this music was meant for. We all have sensitivies to certain things so everything is not for everybody but this touched my heart, makes me cry, makes me think, makes me feel profound love, it does it all. I highly recommend it. Thank you Mr. Holdridge, for giving me this gift!"
2,72-to-77 Stepup Ring review,"I have Sigma 18-50mm, which has 72mm mount. I ordered this step-up ring to use my 72mm Hoya CPL with 77mm Tiffen ND. Both are working perfectly from 28mm and not from 18mm - viginatting error will appear.If you use only one 77mm filter with this step-up ring then there will be not viginatting error.I never tried with 77mm CPL and 77mm ND with this step-up ring, that might not give you this kind of problem."
4,Work as expected,"Quality and fits of this step-up ring is okay, not bad and not great. I use it to attach myNikon 77mm Circular Polarizer II Thin Ring Multi-Coated Glass Filterto myNikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 G ED-IF AF-S VR DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens."
4,pay more to get more,"Not the most sturdy piece of gear in my bag :}, but it does do what you expect it to do. I have ordered another adapter and opted to spend a bit more for it, but that decision was not based on the friction that occurs when screwing it onto my 18-200, but rather on my plan to leave this adapter attached to one filter that I use frequently while having the more durable (and hopefully smoother twisting) in reserve for my other filters.B + W Step-Up Adapter Ring 72mm Lens Thread to 77mm Filter Thread."
3,A bit better than average Messiah recording,"This recording of Messiah done by Helmuth Rilling and the Oregon Bach Festival for Hanssler Classic is a little bit better than the average ""new"" recording of the work. The soloists all sing well, the orchestra plays well too. The problem I had with this recording is the fact that the chorus sings the work with a little too much precision. There is not quite enough of the drama or passion here that Messiah requires. The whole thing runs like a well oiled machine, or a quartz watch. This is the second recording of Messiah that Helmuth Rilling has done, the other is the Mozart arraingment sung in German also recorded for Hanssler Classics. This recording would make a good additional one to have, but I don't think I would make it a first choice, unless you are studying about the work or want to learn to sing it."
4,Last great CD EP by Ultra Vivid Scene,"This is a great effort by Kurt Ralske's one-man band... Forget about the title track. Although a collaboration with the then-darling of indie-pop Kim Deal, 'Special One' is a good song, but not great. No, the other 3 tracks stand out. All are unique to this release. 'Lightning (72 bpm/4 am)' is a mellow, reworking of the ending track on the 'Joy 1967-1990' album. 'A Smile And A Death Wish' is another reworking of this track and features Kurt's superb rambling 'singing'... great title too. 'A Kind Of A Drag' relives UVS's amazing first album and is worth the price for the EP alone. If you happen to stumble upon the 7"" for this release, don't worry if it comes without a sleeve.... That's how it was released.How Kurt went from this to Rev? God knows... and maybe Kurt himself."
4,Good insight in Project Finance,"The book gives an interesting insight in Project Finance and is especially valuable for giving the rationale in using PF versus traditional Corporate Finance.It gives evidence of the matter through a step by step procedure so that every case adds some knowledge. Excellent terminology section.For not experienced professional, maybe it should be read in conjunction with some manual providing the basic principle and more insight in financial and legal technicalities."
5,Great Book,"I used this for guidance as I was preparing a financing proposal for a methanol and formaldehyde chemical plant complex (US$250MM) and along with 'Principles of Project Finance' by E.Yescombe, I was well guided and my proposal was successful."
4,A huge help!,"For years I've had allergy problems so troublesome that I couldn't leave the house without taking something to relieve my itchy watering eyes, sneezing and headaches. When I tried Allergy Rescue I couldn't believe the difference. I take 2 tablets a day, along with the addition of local honey in my tea, and I am virtually allergy free for the first time in years! (Eating local honey is like getting a natural allergy vaccination). Unfortunately it did not get rid of my sinus headaches as I had hoped, but the addition of a B Complex vitamin has helped immensely. I read that women over 40 are defficient in B Vitamins and develop more allergies, especially if they are in menopause, which I am. Allergy Rescue is a GREAT product!"
3,Used for Tattoo - Allergic Reaction,"I used this product for a tattoo, as I had heard it helps prevent scabbing and speeds the healing of tattoos. In fact, it did exactly those things and the tattoo healed great. Unfortunately, I had some sort of skin reaction to the material, and got a rash where it touched non-tattooed skin. It took about a week and a half to go away. I've never had a reaction like this before, so it was a bit surprising. Overall, great product, but be aware that you may have some side effects."
1,Item might be good but not 47th Street Photo,"Item might be good but if you decide to buy it get it from someone else and not 47th Street Photo. I ordered this and four other similar items two days ago and I just got an e-mail stating that they are ""out of stock"". However, I just checked the item again and found out that they are still offering the it."
3,Very informative. One of the best. But it is a boring read,"I have read many books on the issue of intelligence. The insight provided by this book is excellent. In particular, the nature and history of America's volunteer ideological spies is the very best I have ever read. But I have found it a hard read. It is possible to be too through. Honest, it is. I had an easier time with Mitrokhin."
1,Waste of time!!,"I bought this book thinking I wouldn't be able to put it down. I haven't been able to pick it up. This book reads like a third grader's book report, it is merely page after page of boring facts. I read a book every couple of weeks. I read books mainly on military history and history. This rag is not worth using for a doorstop. This book was a waste of paper."
4,R Kelly Video Collection,Plan to purchase another dvd for the house. Hubby has the other dvd in his vehicle. My family loves watching his videos. I would recommend. Makes a nice gift.
4,Great British Pop,"Melanie C, AKA Sporty Spice, has outdone herself, really! I Turn To You is a worldwide club smash, including the U.S! It reached NUMBER 1 the Billboard Club/Dance Charts a while back. This is Melanie C's official 4th single off her multiplatinum album Northern Star. I Turn To you is very clubby, but at some points it's a bit too slow to where dancing isn't possible. However, it's still great. The other singles include Goin' Down (a rock song, about hating someone), Northern Star (pop ballad, about the pressures of being a celebrity), Never Be The Same Again feat. Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes (R&B ballad, about the friends and turning into a bit more), I Turn To You (club song, about looking up to someone when you get down), and finally, If That Were Me (a emotional, heartfelt pop ballad that's about homelessness)."
4,good for visualization,I use this book in first grade when we are working on visualizing. It's great because students can look at the way a person's perspective can change.
5,You never know what your going to get!,"My friend recently brought this book to school. She got it off of here. I loved it! Your always wondering what you'll find next. This book is definitley a ""page turner"" and thats what people like the best.P.S. I'm 13 and I loved it so take away that 6-8 age limit because your losing ALOT of customers!"
1,Review: Zoom (Banyai),The book came in a very good condition and precisely at the time Amazon estimated. I was also satisfied with the careful packaging of the parcel. Well done!
5,Team Builder,Good book to use for team building. I took it apart and have members discribe their picture and then try to put the pages in order without showing the pictures. Its fun and the team learns to trust and listen
3,Maybe I had to have seen it as a child?,"I'm not sure, but, this wasn't really all that impressive to me. I mean... yay... the whole concept is neat, but I read such RAVE reviews that I guess I was expecting something more exciting?I hope this doesn't make me sound like a jerk... I really WAS looking forward to something cool arriving! I gave it to my nephew and he was kind of bored with it right off the bat - and he's very easily excitable!! He opened it and paged through and was like ""meh."" I can't really blame him."
5,Amazing Concept,I don't want to give too much away but the artist in this book without words shakes up notions of perspective and reality. An interesting book on many levels. Is often used for motivation for executives and others as a lesson in how to view things. Highly recommended.
5,My 3 year-old boy love it,He wants to go over these pages again and again forward (zoom out) and backwards (zoom in). The last pages (going into darkness) cause him a bit of anguish... but hey that part of being human and facing nothingness!
5,very satisfied,"This purchase was a very good idea. All the discs worked very well, and the case was in great condition."
3,Slightly disappointed,"I obviously have not had time to view all of these DVDs, but the ones I have had some issues. It may the the type of machine I have, but some of them appeared to vibrate or at least sounds like they are vibrating. Quite anoying. When fast forwarding, it seems to go away. Guess I will have to live with it. I have had other older DVDs do this also."
1,Hercules : The Legendary Journeys Complete Series (Seasons 1-6 bundle),"The older Anchor Bay version:the complete series box set.The disc are very poorly made and I had a difficult time playing many of the episodes on my Panasonic Blu ray dvd player! Around 10 episodes didn't play at all before I got a complete refund from Amazon! I played around 1/2 of the of the series only! The television show was great but, this box set is rotten! Maybe the new Universal version also, sold on Amazon will be better!"
3,No closed captioning,"I loved this series along with Xena. Highlander, and Raven. I purchased the VHS tapes and then the DVD's. I just had surgery and figured that I would watch these series's to visit many of my favorite actors and episodes. I had not watched them for a long time. What is it with these DVD producers? They were released around 2003 and yet they have no CC's or subtitles. This is no way to treat loyal fans. The music has been made louder but the dialogue is now too soft to hear over the music. There are many people with decreased hearing not only due to aging and not all of the people who enjoyed these shows were in their early 20's to 30's, teenagers, or younger! It seems to me that the DVD's should at least be replaced with ones that have CC's and/or subtitles. 5 stars for the shows with no stars for the DVD companies who released these shows."
4,great product harsh sound,I really enjoyed my copy of the hercules 1-6 bundle each episode has a lesson to it and it was a wonder that the series never won awards for best costumes. the only thing that I didn't like about it was the music was to loud for the actors so I'd have to turn it up to 60% on my television to hear the voices of the different actors. but I'm a hardcore fan of the series so nothing not even bad sound could kill it for me :)
2,"Buggy, Buggy DVDs","The video came in good condition, but the DVD's are buggy, buggy, buggy!!! It freezes often - load times can be ridiculous, and the amazing part is that they appear to be authentic dvd's!!! Somebody dropped the ball on this one..."
3,"PRETENTIOUS, INFANTILE BUT FUN","An incredibly pretentious story of the filming of Lasse Braun's (Albert Ferro) Mafia financed, high budget, pornographic extravaganza, SENSATIONS. Tuppy Owens, a noted British writer, actually took a role in this production and is obviously excited by her first on screen sexual performance. Her delight at being in Braun's film sort of reminds me of Barbara Walters' interview with Fidel Castro. Simply full of childlike idolatry.But, it turns out to be a fun kind of read and does provide some insight into the minds of some of the pre-aids, sexual freedom advocates of the 70's."
5,Las mejores voces de todos los tiempos.,"Para mi The Three Degrees (las originales)son las mejores voces de todos los tiempos. Hay que escuchar canciones tales como Dirty ol' Man, Magic In the Air, When Will I see Again entre otras para poder apreciar la calidad vocal de estas feminas. Este cd es una de las mejores recopilaciones hechas, por eso le doy un 5+."
2,I confess...I read it!,"I must say...I have no idea how to scale a horror story...I tried a ""?"", but it didn't fly. I just thought the picture on the cover was so funny that this simply HAD to be something like...It came from the Drive-In. It wasn't. We will NOT go there again."
3,book light magnifier,I was a little disappointed. It is cumbersome to use. I really don't think I will use it like I had expected.
2,No easy read,"A collection of essays covering all periods of modern war as well as essays on the development of the different aspects of war, ie Navy, Army, Air Force. Being a casual reader with just a light interest in history, the book was far to detailed and at times quite difficult to read. This book is not an introducton to the subject and so I would only recommend this book to someone with previous knowledge of the subject and a very keen interest."
4,An excellent overview,"Three basic rules:1) Don't use the flash2) Get as close as you can3) Take as many pictures as you canKelsh spins these simple guidelines into an excellent book that will help any new parent take excellent pictures of their baby. There's almost no technical jargon (which, I'm sure, will please most of its audience), and lots of full-page pictures of babies, showing exactly what you can achieve.If you have a camera and a baby, this is the one book that will have you taking infinitely better photos in just a couple of hours."
3,too basic,"This book is good for the beginner, not the intermediate photographer. I didn't find the book useful & returned it."
5,A Beautiful and Helpful Book,"This gorgeous book will enable you to make beautiful photos of the baby in your life with the camera you already own. His clear, easy to implement instructions will challenge you to record the everyday, precious moments. You and your family and friends will be impressed with the results."
5,Great detailed information for the beginner photographer.,"So much fun to read! Easy, beautiful, and quick reading! The perfect hands on step by step book to taking great shots of your children!"
3,Baby shower gift,This would be a good gift for new parents who only have the ability to point and shoot.Very no tech as it states in the preface.Nice pictures coffee table style format
2,For dumies in photography,"I should been looking more closely to the front cover - it's all about film photography. I wouldn't care much about it if half of the book would be complains how film photography is expensive... Actually reading it I felt like a baby, to read book with so big letters was funny and explanations ""how to"" was not even to amateurs but for dummies in photography. I loved several ideas of this book (like taking photos every year in the same time and place) and the layout of the book but I waited more of it. Much more."
5,Basic advice helps capture your memories beautifully,"I originally bought this when my first child was born, 3 years ago. The chapters were short, easy to understand and left me with phenomenal results. This is now my gift of choice for baby showers to help others capture these precious memories for years to come."
1,I learned nothing new,"This book did not give me any tips that I didn't already know from doing a simple online search for photo blogs or basic photography tips.I was disappointed in the poor quality of the photographs included and did not realize that the pictures were circa 1999 (perhaps I misread the copyright date initially?). The pictures themselves were quite uninspiring. I hate to sound so harsh, but it is true for me.It is very difficult for me to take a photography book seriously when the photos are very dated and reminiscent of looking at the photos I took of my now 10yo when he was a little baby-- with a disposable camera.I think this book was good for the time period that it was first published, but pales in comparison to other books or websites that are out today."
3,"Not my ""Shortcake"" fan's favorite in the collection, but it's cute","The show itself is cute, and I think it has a great moral (as all the shortcake movies do) when the villain ""Sour Grapes"" learns that helping others is more fulfilling and enjoyable than deceiving them. I had hoped it would be more interactive, (inspire my daughter to get up and dance with the movie, but it didn't)and my copy DID NOT COME WITH THE DANCE MAT THAT THE DESCRIPTION HAD PROMISED!!! But overall it is OK; my daughter watches it occassionally, but it is not her favorite shortcake movie. I think her favorites are Big Country Fun and Glimmer Berry Ball, just an FYI."
2,VERY limited scope,"This book would prove to be of utmost benefit to those who use a Nikon camera and an SB series flash. You would also benefit from the book if you are taking pictures for large corporations, which the author says has not been done since the 1980s. The book is a little too limited in scope to prove to be of great value. SOME of the diagrams are helpful."
1,Not very helpfull,"I agree with the other post. Great if you have a Nikon flash, but not much help with other types of lighting solutions. The author needed to get into more detail other than just flash photography. Also,the writing was hard to follow and confusing."
4,Good location lighting tips,"The author gives a little bit of flash ""basics"" and gives a lot of great ideas on how to light different locations. I would recommend this book even to just get different ideas. FYI: No digital photography information,"
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,I bought this book with out really looking at the title I guess! This is more for photographers who plan to use 2 or more lights to shoot on location for corporate use.
4,great price for filters,"Great filters and great price. Be careful when ordering that you pay attention to the size. If your old filter says 14X36, make sure you dont order one that says 14X36 (actual size) it wont fit. A regular air return register that has 14X36 filters are actually a little smaller to fit in the frame. I made the mistake of ordering actual size and they were to big. Forget about returning them if your wrong, you will pay more in shipping than the filters are worth. Oh, and dont let your grandson use the box as a pretend boat with the filters in it and smash all the filters."
2,A stick of butter doesn't fit,"On the plus side, like all of the Switch-3 items, the colors are beautiful. However, I returned this product because the dish doesn't hold a standard stick of butter sold in the US, though it would be perfect for cream cheese. You can't tell from the picture, but it's double the width and shorter than a standard dish. Also, the lid is bigger that the base so it appears to be mismatched."
4,A Symphony of Uncommitted Crimes,"I write this after reading the other posted reviews, and I do so for one reason: namely, to point out that Ware and company are exceptionally subtle players, in the tradition of Ayler and Dolphy. To be certain, Ware has a gallimaufry of timbres at his command and a tendency towards the brash, the honk, and the skronk. These ""noises"" may make some listeners uncomfortable. For those listeners, I recommend the refuge of the absolutely beautiful ensable playing. Take the time, (and the effort), to put your ears around the melodic juxtaposition of Ware's playing against that of his group, (i.e., Mikuros Blues and The Way We Where). Those with the (guts) to do so will be rewarded with an great blowin' session, one eloquent like an uncommitted crime. Highly recommended."
3,"Nice CD, but something not quite there...","There is something about the production of this record that I cannot come to terms with. It is a good record (3.5 stars would have been more appropriate), but I find Ware's sax to be too over-powering and there is a big production sound I find endemic of big labels. (I found a similar problem wth James Carter's CD'S on DIW/Columbia) I really should come back to it and re-evaluate, but I find that Iberra (whose drumming I usually love) and Shipp are not the best compliment to Wares explosive sound (Parker on the other hand seems to work well with him). Perhaps I should hear some of the other releases that this combo has done on different labels. I must give Kudos however to Sony/Columbia (via Brandford Marsalis) for giving this music a chance as it is quite challenging and will certainly not be on of their best sellers!In Summary, a good cd but not excellent. I am happy with it in my collection (all cd's cannot be 5 star material now can they)."
3,Not for TV cable to cable modem!,"I had hoped to use this (with adapters) to link my TV cable to my cable modem, providing surge protection, but this unit is not designed for this and will not work. My fault!"
4,A Fresh Introduction to What Faith Can Mean In One's Life,"This stimulating and somewhat surprising book. Not your usual devotional book, this is a volume which will inspire both those who have walked in faith for years, a pastor seeking renewal, and those who are just beginning."
1,Poor selection for to much money!,"No way would I pay that much money for re-mastered songs like this. I think this is priced to keep Sharon and Ozzy in their mansion! Sorry guy's, way better music out there for less money."
4,The Essential Ozzy Osbourne,"This CD had a great selection of songs, but not all of the most popular by the OZZ."
3,Complilation?,"What's going on here? Why is it that there's not any ""Ultimate sin"" material?!!?!? It's the best Ozzy album... songs like ""Shot in the dark"" and ""Secret loser"" should be in any Ozzy Compilation... There are some decisons I never get to understand...Start giving ""The ultimate sin"" the credit it deserves!!!"
2,Pretty Worthless,"I'm less of an Ozzy fan than I was (thank ""The Osbournes"" for that), but I still enjoy some of his good stuff, like Mr Crowley and Crazy Train, etc. This ""essential ozzy"" is, however, nothing more than an attempt to grub even more money off of the whirlwind success of that horrid show. There are numerous omissions to the tracklist, but others have covered that. The fact is, one could just get his albums and be done with it. This ""special edition at a low price"" (it says so on the sticker) is too [much] for a barely-remastered double cd with nothing new to give to longtime fans. Don't bother with this, just get his good albums (""Blizzard of Ozz"" for one) or go nuts on Kazaa or Gnutella."
2,Very substandard mixing,"Okay, the only reason I give this two stars is the fact that it is a great group of tracks. The remix though is terrible!!!! It's kinda neat hearing Randy's tracks mixed in a bit more forward than they were on the originals but when the whole thing sounds like a muddy mono mess it's too painful to listen to! I can make better sounding master recordings on my SoundBlaster Audigy and CoolEdit Pro. It is beyond belief that that trash left a so called professional recording studio. Randy is rolling in his grave. It's just too painful to listen to.I agree too with the other folks who've mentioned here that some tracks from the Ultimate Sin would have been nice too. Hey, that's why God made CD burners.Save yourself the money. Dig out your old Ozzy CDs and burn yourself your own ultimate Ozzy collection. They will sound better and you can include all the songs you like."
2,Without Sin,"You call this a complete or essential collection? there is nothing and I mean nothing on this double disc from ""The Ultimate Sin"" album. I hate when record companies skip over albums when putting together a retrospect of someone's carrer. ""The Ultimate Sin"" album was a BIG seller when it came out back in 1986 with such hit's as the Title Track and ""Shot In The Dark"" as well as other great album tracks ""Lightning strikes"" & ""Never Know Why"". How shallow can you get!!!!"
5,"Awesome, baby!","I loved this CD. I thought it was better then...well...everything. I listen to this CD all the time. I love the songs: Crazy Train, Goodbye to Romance, and Paranoid. I also like Desire, Thunder Underground, and No Easy Way Out. I like ALL of these songs. I think this 2-CD set is perfect. I gave it 5 stars!"
1,No more dignity,"There was a time when Ozzy Osbourne represented the undying and never quitting attitude of the metal genre. That time has passed, with Ozzy's wife Sharon making money off of him any chance she can. Whether that be with a reality show on MTV, lame OzzFest lineups, or new compilations containing songs which long time Ozzy fans have heard a thousand plus times before whether it be from the previous albums, or Ozzy's other best of, ""Ozzman Cometh"". This ""Essential"" set is basically all the Ozzy songs that radio ate up, singles from Ozzy's last album, the incredibly lame ""Down to Earth"", and, of course, ""Paranoid"". Anyone knows the best material Ozzy ever had a hand in came in his Sabbath days, and this is nothing but the previously released (and re-released) material that we've heard before and already own. If you're a casual or new fan to Ozzy and you don't own any other material by him, then this may be worth picking up, but for the rest of us, we already know to avoid this."
2,"Not bad for a beginner, but it could be better","This is the second greatest hits compilation by Ozzy Osbourne.It is an improvement over the ozzman cometh, but still needs work.My version(which I have already made) would be:Disc 1:1.Crazy Train (original)2.Mr.Crowley (original)3.Suicide Solution (original)4.Goodbye to Romance (original)5.I Don't Know (Live from Tribute)6.Over the Mountain (original)7.Flying High Again (original)8.You Can't Kill Rock N'Roll(original)9.Believer ( Live from Tribute)10.Diary Of A Madman (original)11.Bark At the Moon (original)12.Rock N'Roll Rebel (original)13.Ultimate Sin14.Killer Of Giants15.Shot In the Dark16.Paranoid (Live from Tribute)Disc 2 :1.Miracle Man2.Crazy Babies3.Breakin' All the Rules4.Bloodbath in Paradise(live from Just Say Ozzy)5.Mr Tinkertrain6.I Dont Want to Change the World7.Mama Im Coming Home8.No More Tears9.Road to Nowhere10.Perry Mason11.See You On the Other Side(demo version)12.Tomorrow13.Gets Me Through14.Bang Bang(You're Dead)15.Dreamer"
5,GREAT SINGING+SUPERB GUITARING=A BRILLIANT CD,"the ultimate ozzy collection is an absolute must have for ozzy fans.most of his big hits as a solo artist with rhandy rhoads are mentioned here like MR CROWLEY,BARK AT THE MOON,CRAZY TRAIN and MAMA I'M COMING HOME.brilliant.very highly recommended along with the ultimate sin album from ozzy.five stars.GET THIS CLASSIC OZZY CD."
5,Best Ozzy Compilation Ever,"This is by far my favorite Ozzy compilation album. It saved me loads of money because I would've bought a whole bunch of different albums jsut for my favorite songs, when they're already on this one. Amazing album."
4,Essential Ozzy Osbourne,"Created in 2003 this has some of Ozzy's most essential cuts up to that point of his career. Outstanding tracks include ""Crazy Train"", ""Flying High Again"", ""Diary of a Madman"", ""Bark at the Moon"", Rock 'n' Roll Rebel"", ""Mama, I'm Coming Home"", ""No More Tears"", the Grammy Award winning ""I Don't Want to Change the World"" & ""Perry Mason""Ozzy has been dubbed ""the Father of Metal"", this is ample testament to that. Many of us remember him from Black Sabbath & might still consider that the pinnacle of his career. Ozzy has influenced many in the heavy metal genre, almost every metal group claims his influence on their choice of music. Whether you love him or hate him, he has proven himself to be a survivor in more ways than one."
2,I already have...,"...Ozzy's greatest hits. I own the first generation remasters of Blizzard Of Ozz and Diary Of A Madman (the ones with the original band members, not the 'Sharon' remasters where two original band members' tracks were replaced - 20 years after the fact). Blizzard and Diary are all you need, Ozzy hasn't done anything remotely good since 1982."
3,What the hell..........,"O.K. I've been listening to the ozz since i came out of the womb.I've seen every tour. This compilation really bothers me. How canyou put so many songs from the No More Tears album on here and not one from The Ultimate Sin? The only reason anyone thinks thatNo More Tears was a good album, is because so many more people canget into it. You go to an Ozz concert now and its like all these little teeny bopper kids are there, the only thing they know is Mama i'm coming home. Get real-No more tears blew hard. And to not put something like Killer of Giants on this album, or Shot inthe dark or Fool like you is insane. I know music has changed over the years, but Ozz has really let his die hard fans down on the last few albums. Just stick with Blizzard to No Rest for the Wicked. Love ya Ozz, but damn, come on.........."
2,"Great music, horrible sound","I am not going to comment on the compilation, it is OK. The sound quality however is terrible. The supposedly rerecorded bass on the older tracks is quite weak, most of the recordings sound horrible, with a lot of distortions, elevated highs, clipping, suppressed midrange and muddy bass; ""Paranoid"" sounds like it was recorded with a microphone hidden in somebody's purse. I have quite a few CDs with hard-rock and metal recorded in the 70s, and they all sound better. This CD is a pain to listen to: great music ruined by the the way it is recorded."
1,just a attempt to get even richer by the oz,"this is just an attemp for ozzy to cash in on his mtv fame, do not buy this, don't even entertain the thought of buying this. i could make a better oz compilation then this, even though i hate ozzy. ozzy has sold out, he is now an mtv icon, along the lines of brittney spears and jessica simpson, and i wouldn't be surprised if he colabarated w/ them on some music related effort for even more cash. whats even worse is that this new fame garnered by ozzy has prompted the mtv kids,(kids around 10 to 15) to start listening to ozzy and sabbath. it really angers me, he is rolling in cash and lives in a mansion, yet, has no talent, every song was written for him by other musicians, kinda like the backstreet boys."
1,Pointless,After Ozzman commeth....lame name but anyhow there was no need for another greatest hits after just one studio album.
3,WHERE'S ULTIMATE SIN?,I JUST CANT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NOT 1 SONG FROM ONE OF OZZYS BEST ALBUM ON HERE! JUST BUY ALL HIS ALBUMS KUZZ THE OZZMAN COMETH AINT SO GREAT EITHER
4,The truly essential would be buying all his albums,"So the list isn't what everyone wants, good luck with all the songs Ozzy has made. They could have put any number of songs on the CDs and someone would complain that they missed this and that. These two CDs are exactly that, just a bunch of Ozzy songs slopped together. And who can complain with a bunch of Ozzy songs? Ozzy rocks. Make your own collection and throw it on a CD if you dont like it."
3,"No ""Shot In The Dark""?","Don't get me wrong...I LOVE Ozzy. Without him, rock & roll would NOT be what it is today. This collection is a great set of songs from ""The Master Of Darkness"", but I think that Sharon & Ozzy need to grow up and realize that whether they like it or not, ""Ultimate Sin"" does exist, and fans love ""Shot In The Dark""! To have an ""essential"" Ozzy collection and not include that song is just pure ingorance. Other than that....I guess it's worth buying."
3,Where are...?,"I'm not a huge Ozzy fan, I'd say I'm the casual one. Although I have all his cds, I don't rush out and get them, I just get them eventually. That being said, I was looking forward to this cd because I love these best of/ Essential/Greatest Hits type things. Then I saw the track listing. I couldn't believe there was no ""Shot in the Dark"". I also think they could have licensed the duet with Lita Ford, ""Close My Eyes Forever"" for this compilation. It was his only appearance in the top ten with a single."
4,My first...,"This is my first... Threshold CD, that is. I must say I am very impressed. While I can see a number influences/similarities -- Dokken, Dio, Fates Warning, Dream Theater, Queensryche (Warning ERA), Queen, and even Randy Newman(yes, 2nd to last track) right off the top of my head -- Threshold are definitly not a copycat band. They take all of these influences and meld them into a very powerful disc."
4,Almost perfect,"I'm a recent fan of Threshold, and I can say that it's one of my favourite bands, among Dream Theater, Shaman and Sonata Arctica (I know... they have different styles, but I like them all because of their creativity).I think they've made a great work; I just think sometimes their lyrics tend to be a little bit repetitive, like in The Ravages Of Time (that track could be shorter, without losing substance). But it's still a great purchase. Go get it!"
3,Some good prog-metal,"This is some good stuff.This band has everything you want, crunchy riffs,solid drumming some good melody and a voicethat wraps it up all together to make it a nice little package.But, not quite the caliper of Evergrey and Vanden Plas,to be honest I don't think there is anybody that is in their caliper.Well, there is always(just a little heavier)Nevermore."
3,3 1/2 stars - Not Their Best Stuff,"I am really starting to get into this band- but this is not their best stuff (besides the 1st and last track--amazing songs) If you considering buying a Threshold album- get Subsurface, or Criticall Mass. Who knows- maybe ill give this album 4 stars in a while- but after a few listens, (5 or so) I believe they have done better."
5,Marvelous Window Into the Past,"This is a marvelous window into the past and a segment of the artistic world largely ignored by many western texts. Whether it is The Visitation's lovely hues, the magnificent lines of the Lombard Basilica or the massive cruciform of St. Clement's in Ohrid, Art Treasures of Eastern Europe shimmers in an artistic legacy of those who have come before. Outstanding reference book, especially for students of art and history."
1,"Although advertised as usable with DVD players, this is a computer-only speaker system","Don't get fooled. This system will only give you surround sound from a computer, since it lacks a S/PDIF input (either optical or coax). The advertising is completely false.Plus, the staff at Altec Lansing are more interested in defending their advertising than providing solutions."
4,Crisp Sound,"The sound from these speakers is really crisp and clear. Its got the controls on the right satellite. Apart from the power button, there are 3 buttons for sub, center and surround, each of which can be set up separately using the common volume dial.It's not very loud on the bass but otherwise it sounds just fantastic. The space saving design is great. Saves me the trouble of running cables all over the room. These can be hooked up to your TV or DVD player too. It even works if you have a stereo sound card. But 5.1 sound card is recommended to get the best output and value for your money.CNET would give these babies a 5.8 but I would definitely give them a 9/10. These are especially good if you live in an apartment and you want a 5.1 set."
4,Value for money...,This is one of first 5.1 speaker systems and i am pretty statisfied with quality and output. Initially the sub-woffer wasnt performing upto the mark.... but then later realized had placed it in the wrong position....Good value for the price quoted...
5,Excellent - along with a decent sound card,"I purchased these speakers right after Christmas. I have a Dell Dimension 4600 with built-in 5.1 surround sound. After I connected these speakers, I was not impressed. The bass was extremely weak. I thought about returning the speakers until I realized that maybe what I need is a decent dedicated sound card.Well, last week I purchased the Sound Blaster Audigy 4. Tonight I installed the sound card and what a difference! I have more bass now than I know what to do with. The speakers themselves are now crystal clear and the sub literally rattled the windows. I tested this with the new War of the Worlds DVD where the alien first comes out of the ground. I literally felt like I was in the middle of the action.So these speakers are fantastic as long as you're running them through a decent sound card. I can't say enough about these speakers paired with the SB Audigy 4. And the surround effect of these speakers is truly amazing."
4,wow,"overall its a good surround sound system, though it woulda been better if theres a volume control on the subwoofer. i just cant get enough of its bass its just not loud enough ^^."
2,Too much static involved with these speakers,"I purchased these speakers a few weeks ago. I thought the static was due to the speakers being too close to my computer and/or power supply, but I moved the speakers far away from either and the problem still persists. Altec Lansing usually has good speakers, but I do not recommend these."
2,Work but badly designed,"These spoons are cute, and they work well. But there are 2 big problems. First, the scoop part is quite deep on the bigger ones, and if you try to hand wash it, there is a good chance it will break off. The connection between the scoop and the handle is VERY narrow (unnecessarily narrow - so not a lot of strength there). Second, The spoons aren't easily attached to the ring. So, unless you want to patiently reattach them every time, they end up as loose spoons in your drawer. I'm disappointed because Tupperware usually makes such nice products."
5,Buy Them!,"These measuring spoons are nicely shaped for spice containers, and easy to clean! Great value for the price."
2,Hepatitis C Cookbook,"This author puts extreme stress on food being of organic origins, and reducing intake of red meats. Unfortunately she loads recipes with whole milk, cream and butter. The butterfat in these products are is unhealthful as eating meat fat. They should be limited in all diets, but especially in foods prepared for people with liver damage."
1,To much dairy,I agree with the other reviewer. To much dairy is not good for liver. Actually all dairy shoould be eliminated and more green vegetables!
3,HepC Cookbook,"This cookbook is just okay, nothing really special as far as a have to have recipe. It's just using common sense, and eating fresh vegtables, salad with fresh fruit, lean meat. I'll donate it to our local library."
3,Legend of Dragoon,"I have not written a review on this product because I wanted to give the sender plenty of time to set things right. Time is up.The game seemed to be in good condition, but halfway through the game it stopped working. I've tried my other games on my PS2 and they all work fine so I know it is not my system. When I contacted the seller asking for a replacement, I was told she would get back to me about it. I waited a long time and have not heard anything since, nor have I received a working replacement for this game.http://www.amazon.com/gp/aag/main?ie=UTF8&asin;=&isAmazonFulfilled;=0&isCBA;=&marketplaceID;=ATVPDKIKX0DER&seller;=A14P9YYL0HKTHYThis is the seller. I can only say... Buy at your own risk."
1,it doesent work,My friend had this game a few years ago and it worked on my ps2 and i loved it so i thought i would buy if for myself. so i have and its came early which is great but it doesent work on my ps2 and i dont have a ps1. Is there anyway to make it work on my ps2?
1,Not worth it.,"This is not a book, but an advertising brochure for ASAP and integrators like E&Y and IBM, that has been stretched to the size of a book. The relevant material is worth about 10 pages and the rest is an exercise in tautology. It was worth spending the mailing charge to return this book."
1,Not recommended - redundant information; gaping holes,Very disappointed in the material provided. Information was repeated on major points up to 5 times throughout the text as if it was being covered for the first time. The editor missed some gaping holes in the content. Back cover summary was inconsistent with content. Provided a fair summary of ASAP concepts but severely lacking in explanation and detail.
1,Complete Waste of Time,I am a SAP practitioner. I was looking for a book to get started in ASAP. I was utterly shocked to see the poor quality of the book. This book does not even cover the basics of ASAP. It is a hodge podge of information. Lot of repetition of useless information... PS: If you look at the review of this book you will notice either 5 stars or 1 star. Be very careful of 5 stars. Read those reviews carefully.
2,"A redundant overview of ASAP, E&Y-IBM Advertisement.","Gives a very high overview of ASAP and problems to consider during an implementation with much redundant text. The CD produced by SAP AG has much more in depth info in that subjuect. This book would be good for a manager considering or in the very early preparation stages of an implementation. The blatent plugs for Earnst and Young and IBm were also a bit off putting, but consistant with the information in the ""About the Author"" section."
1,401 pages of marketing rambling with an extreme fudge factor,I was looking for a handbook on how to tackle SAP implementation projects in mid-sized companies. I was utterly disappointed with this book. It is a series of marketing documents from various SAP partners stitched together without any editing or structure. Meaningless buzzwords make most of it totally unreadable for anyone with a practitioners approach. Not worth a star.
3,nikon 5400,"what the professional reviewers say about the problems w/ lack of AF assist in low lighting conditions is true: photos taken in low light are often out of focus. in addition, the viewfinder is inaccurate; you will eat up battery life because you will have to rely on the display to frame your shots accurately.on the other hand, the ergonomics of the camera are great: it just feels perfect in your hand. and outdoor shots are detailed and colorful. the wider lens angle is also really nice."
4,Still good!,I have had this camera now for 2 years and I have found that the people do NOT read the manual or do not memorise it. I get very good pictures and it has some great built in features. I love it.
1,Don't buy from Adorama Camera,"I ordered this camera from Adorama Camera in NY via a link in Amazon.com. Adorama did not send this item, as it was at a very good price. They claim it was a mistake in the posting on Amazon, they would not fufill the order and their customer service was extremely rude."
3,Noisy display,Unter normal indoor lighting conditions the image in the 1.5 LCD display is extreamly noisey and blury
2,Nothing new,"At this price you should be getting more for your money these days. The camera takes good photos but so do many other PS (that's piont and shoot for you southern folk, and you don't start a sentence with And). Getting back to reviewing this latest Nikon one good thing is it has 15 scene selections for those that are photo challanegd. This is a big plus for newbees but if you're paying top dollar you'll be in A or S mode anyway.If you use the LCD for composing it's a bit small.Good things are the 28mm wide end (but the Nikon 5000 had that).The extra telephoto end is a little longer compared to the 5000 but comes at a price (smaller f stop).A good camera but the new Canon G5 is already making Nikon lower the price."
2,"Sounds great, but doesn't deliver","This camera looked like the perfect thing--many of the same capabilities as the 5700, but a more compact body. I was very excited when it arrived. After using it for a while, though, I realized what a mistake I'd made. Number one problem: focus. The camera has no auto-focus assist lamp, and does a TERRIBLE job of focusing in indoor light situations. Nikon would have us believe that the flash is normally required for those times, but my 4-year-old Canon Powershot S10 handles similar situations perfectly. In fact, the Powershot S10 outperforms the 5400 in a lot of ways. Compounding the problem of the 5400's inept autofocusing is the small, grainy LCD. So even if it looks like your picture's in focus, chances are when you see them full-size you'll realize they weren't. Too bad I took too long trying to figure out whether all these problems were user-error, or I'd have returned the camera to Amazon. Now I'm stuck with it."
1,Dead Nikon 5400,"I looked long and hard to decide between Canon G5 And Nikon 5400. Unfortunately I picked the Nikon. I and many many other people have a bad CCD in this camera . Nikon wants $165 dollars to fix it. Do a search on this camera on Ebay (as is),there are dozens of them. There are none for the Canon G Series.NikonBatter UPand Thanks a Lot."
4,A very good camera for such a price,"I have been enjoying this camera for almost 15 months now. Good thing is, it has various modes to take photos. Swivel screen is a real good thing when lot of people are obstructing your view. Though the screen size is small (1.5 inches). Its a nice camera for Point & shoot purpose & looks are pretty cool. Bad thing is - its a battery guzzler. I had to buy another battery so that I can use it for a full day, Thats why 4 stars. Controls are easy, gripping is easy, learning curve is short. It doesn't have a self lens shutter. You need to manually place the cap on the lens. I would recommend either buying a fast CF card or taking pics on 'Normal' with 5 MP combination, else it takes time between two consecutive shots. Overall a good camera, Nikon can still make it better. (I hope Nikon is listening)"
1,"If you want this camera to fail, buy it","You do not want to get any Nikon cameras from the last 4~5 years. Most of them use the SONY CCD sensor, which has been failing like crazy as of late. Of course, for the 5400, Nikon finally fessed up and decided to issue a service advisory. But the company's repair record is so spotty that I've decided never to buy a Nikon again. They tried to ""fix"" my sensor the 1st, and ended up breaking the control system. My camera is now in for its 3rd ""redo.""Don't buy this camera unless you like non-functioning cameras and nonexistent service."
2,5400 has issues!,"Check nikonusa web for coolpix service advisory. Some of the 5400 and others havepossible component failures, as many reviewers described before. My 5400 had CCDissue (I use it very lightly) and Nikon USA repair it for free (Thank God!) Butthat will make me think twice about the quality of the Nikon camera when I plan topurchase another. In fact, I am looking for a P&S; camera and for sure I won't putNikon's on the top of my list. Nikon 5400 will be my first and last Nikon product."
1,something wrong with it,"I bought this Nikon coolpix5400 camara 15 months ago and it just broken without any reason. it has distorted images now and very vague color. Not only mine. the same type of nikon camera of my friends is also broken. also noreason, also distorted images. So, we do not think this id a coincidence. We will argue with Nikon Campany about it."
1,Camera died for no reason,"Like the others, my camera just stopped working, without any abuse on my part. Nikon recalled the 5700, which had a similar problem, but won't recall the 5400. I won't be buying another Nikon, even though I really enjoyed it while it worked.It broke just in time for the holidays. Thanks for standing by your product, Nikon.ETA: I sent it in to Nikon and they fixed it in about a week without charging me. It is as good as new!"
1,Crashed and Burned,"Bought the camera a couple of years ago. Worked great (used about 10 times)until a couple of weeks ago, then froze up. Sent it in for repairs to Nikon Service Center and was informed today it will cost me at least $150.00 +shipping and handling to have fixed as it's out of warranty. I was not informed what was wrong with the camera. This camera was well maintained and looks like it just came out of the box. Perhaps the reviews I have read, about ""Made in Korea"" were true. Anyway, I'm very disappointed and hope this isn't a Nikon trend as I have always liked their products...."
2,Stay Away,"I have had this camera for 6 years. For the entire 6, I have been frustrated by the delay in writing the picture. I am not sure how many fps they claim, I am here to tell you it is seconds per frame. There is a 3-10 second delay between each photo. Now, I am just your average user, 4 kids and want good pics of them. I have to admit, when I got the shot, there is no better. I have the wide angle and telephoto lenses and are very happy with those (not happy with the amount of time to change a lenses).My sister purchased a Canon Rebel. After witnessing how fast she could reel off the shots, I dumped this and purchased the XS. For an investment of 700, I now feel I have a much better system than the 5400 ever could have provided. The Nikon is on its way to ebay.I would strongly advise not to buy this camera."
5,A look into how Civil Engineering really was back then.,A truly fine book. I would recommend it to any prospective or freshman engineering student at the least. It tells a story of what it was really like to be in the business back at the turn of the century on a truly monumental project for it's time. The book is semi-technical in content and doesn't overwhelm the reader. The story is truly amazing. It's a fast read and likely to be remembered.
4,Great Inexpensive product for Carpal Tunnel Symptoms,"At 29, I have carpal tunnel symptoms after sitting at a computer for an hour or more. My wrists ache and hurt with pain up to my elbows at times. I've tried different positions, but nothing seems to help aside from having 2 pounds of ice strapped to my wrists. That is, until I decided to get a set of these braces. It's unfortunate that you can no longer order them online (last I checked, at least) but they are still well worth it. Wearing these braces help with the pain and discomfort greatly. If you wear long sleeves, then you can wear them all day at work. The only issue being that the plastic part sticks below my wrist level making me find a way to adjust hand placement on my desk, but it's not a big deal especially considering how much they help."
2,Useless if you suffer from ulnar nerve pain,"I purchased this brace with the hope that it could mitigate some pain from my ulnar nerve damage. After all the carpal tunnel and ulnar nerve are very close and both affect the use of your hand. May be it was the wrong device for the purpose, but I found no visible relief after several weeks of use."
3,coolant pump,It was almost a perfect replacement for my worn out setup on my Enco horizontal bandsaw. Plastic tank was too tall. Fortunately I was able to remove the pump and install it in the old tank. Works great.
2,Really hard to put on,Really hard to put on and bunches up after they slide down and acts like a tournequet. We stopped using them
4,total knee support hose,working great and the quality is fine. I would order again if I need them. The doctor gave me one pair but I have to wear them for 4 weeks and needed a back up pair.
2,"Fine, while it worked, but now it doesn't","This item worked perfectly for the first few months and blended in well with the landscaping with its green color. Lately, there are a number of ""ghost"" alarms, so we have unplugged it. Also, it is not easy to open to remove the batteries, you must use a jeweler's type phillips head screwdriver to remove the sunken-in screws. One of the screw chambers broke off after the first battery replacement. We live at the end of a private road, so don't get much traffic at all, just the postman, guests, deliveries, and ourselves. Perhaps it is the Clifton, Virginia ""Bunnyman"" who is wandering past. Who knows. We are seeking a new one, but won't buy this brand."
1,Garbage,"Like the other reviewers, I thought the idea was great for the same reasons (live in the country) but it is a piece of garbage!! It does eat batteries like candy and I had less success than four months. Mine lasts about 4 days before batts are dead. And the false alarms make you turn the device off. After you've spent a small fortune in batteris you just chuck the thing. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT buy this product! GE should be ashamed of themselves! I can't use enough exclamation points to make my point."
1,Eats batteries like candy,"I loved this alarm at first. We had it about a year. It ate batteries like they were candy. We, too, finally unplugged it due to false alarms. The light to tell you if anyone came while you were away is totally worthless unless you walked out and back into your own driveway."
1,"Good idea, not well executed","This is based on a couple of months of ownership. Batteries have not been changed yet but will need it soon.Many, many, false alarms due to wind until I got rid of that inadequate little plastic post and zip tied the sensor to a tree close to the driveway. No false alarms since. Works reliably there.The intrusion light on the base unit is absolutely worthless. It is supposed to let you know when someone enters your driveway while you are gone. That is fine as long as you aren't taking your own car out of the driveway or coming back in it. alarm stays on until manually reset. Could be easily improved by having the light flash to indicate the NUMBER of intrusions. The engineer who designed it should seek a new career. Not recommended."
1,false positives = heart ache,I received three false positives with this product after trying to get pregnant for over 10 years. Needless to say I was heart broken. I have contacted the company and waiting for a response from them. Stores are pulling this product off their shelves due to the inaccuracey of this product. I do not reccomend it!
1,Don't waste your money!,"Please don't waste your money on this product! I know of WAY too many women who get FALSE positives with these tests, I being one.False negatives are normal and can and do happen. But false positives! No way! This company really needs to do a recall and FIX this product."
1,Not even close to the standard we come to expect from VR,"Vault Reports strength is the targeted and highly specified nature of their reports. Industry and even company specific information is what makes them what they are. This book is just the opposite: vague, broad, full of obvious advice and therefore useless.It attempts to cover resume writing, cover letters and all types of interviews in one book. Impossible. Save your money, buy seperate books on the three areas and Vault Reports on companies and industries that interest you."
5,An Excellent Survey of Channeling,"Jon Klimo's book, which I read some years ago, really brought together in a pretty objective way a lot of good thinking on what channeling is all about, as well as detailing the history of the phenomenon. I'm glad to see it's available again, since my copy got ""beamed up"" and I haven't seen it since! ;)"
3,Transparent,"This book is no DaVinci Code. Rather, The Seventh Unicorn is part soap opera, part cozy mystery. The premise upon which it's based is intriguing, and well founded in art history, the most engimatic medieval tapestries being the Unicorn series in Paris and the other in NYC. What is disappointing about this plot is the ease with which everything falls into the heroine's lap, the transparency of the other characters, and the total absence of suspence. What's valuable and enjoyable about the plot is the information provided about the tapestries, their iconography and symbolism, and their possible provenance, as well as the glimpse into the art and museum world."
3,Nice Summer Read,"This was a nice, light summer read. Even though the plot and characters were a bit predictible, I still enjoyed it."
3,An easy read...,"The book started out great - suspenseful with some interesting characters. I loved how the author explained the symbolism in ancient tapestries. About halfway through the book though, it started to drag. I didn't understand the actions of some of the characters - actions just seemed ""out of the blue"". This would be a good vacation read."
3,Don't be fooled by their rather docile band name,"Don't be fooled by their rather docile band name, Vampire Moose will sneak up on you with their full-force metal and destroy your senses before you have a chance to put up a fight. You might as well just submit to their power."
2,Too difficult for Intro to clinical dx shelf exam,"Our school recommended this book for the intro to clinical dx shelf exam even though I think it's supposed to be for Step 2 CK because ummm...that's what it SAYS ON THE BACK! As far as using this for the shelf exam, it is way harder than it needs to be and the explanations don't do any heavy lifting for you. Just think of all those crappy teachers you had in your first two years, they basically expect you to understand it all with very minimal effort on their behalf. Not ...fun ...at ...all.Even though in a year I might know more and be more comfortable with the material, my plan is also not to use this book for Step 2 CK and hopefully find something better."
4,ok,"It won't get rid of all headaches, although it seems to help a lot for eye-strain-caused ones. I wish there was a little more 'stuff' in the tube so that you get more uses out of it. Although the commercial is annoying, not trying the product because of that is childish. If it works for you then you'd only be keeping your headaches by boycotting it. It is nice that you don't have to ingest anything, so it's good for people with sensitive stomachs or who don't want to take aspirin/tylenol for their possible long-term side effects."
1,"So, I apply it directly to my forehead?","The commercial for this product is enough to give you a headache that no product could cure. I haven't tried it, and won't because the commercial is so annoying - the commercial will likely cause far more headaches than the product itself will relieve."
2,Beware time,"I absolutely loved the comfort of the bra and it supported well...FOR A WHILE...but take note that after about three months, maybe a little more, I thought I'd lost weight because I had to snap the bra tighter and then tighter again. I hadn't lost weight. The bra stretched eventually completely to a useless point. I was so pleased with the comfort originally that I'd bought ten of them. What a waste because now I'm bra shopping again for a comfortable well made bra."
3,"O.K., not great","Always looking for a better wirefree full figure bra. This one is o.k., fine for fit and coverage, but don't love the lace seam and finish across the back closure has a rough spot."
4,Increasing understanding of Aging,"Hellen Bee is able to carry one through the years of adulthood through many avenues. Using scientific studies she interprets the data in meaningful ways. Inclusion of personal accounts and her conversational style make the reading interesting. The book continually ties previous ideas to new concepts giving a nice continuity. I especially enjoyed her occasional insertions of the not-so-scientific spiritual aspects of the adult experience, which I was not expecting in a textbook. My ideas of what it means to grow old were challenged and changed during the reading of this book. Some myths of adulthood are adeptly smashed making the thought of aging not such a frightful one. The only criticism I would include is that occasionally the point being made was not clear to me and a few conclusions seem to have contradictory statements in following chapters. That may be expected in the field of psychology, however."
1,this book sucks big time,this book was a mandatory read for my college class the author rambles about her life 5pages into the book and its already TMI for me its a dull and boring read yes i am a guy.so whatits still boring
5,Save on books,Get smart guys and order all your college books and all your reading material from Amazon! We have saved so much and believe me most of us need all the financial help we can get. Thank you Amazon for the wonderful help you have been able to provide.
3,it took a while for the book to arrive,"I ordered this book on April 2, 2010. I did not receive any updates other that ""it shipped."" I did not receive the book until April 20th. It took more time than expected."
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could,"I understand that the typical Psychology Book is not exactly a riveting novel, but good god, this was way too much. I have never been more annoyed with a text book- I would never voluntarily have read this garbage! She would have had a much shorter book if we weren't forcefed her life story at every possible chance she could insert it in. This woman is very full of herself...very full. There were a lot of typos, a lot of redundent sentences, and a lot of crap we didn't need! I hope for the rest of the psychology students of the world that this author reads these reviews and vows never to write another text book again. If I ever have a class that requires another text book by her, I will drop without hesitation! And change majors the next morning!"
4,"Not perfect, but it works","I had some internal water damage in the posts of my deck railing. I dug out the rotted wood the best I could and let it dry out with a fan. Then I coated the exposed wood with the Petrifier Wood Hardener. The next day, the wood definitely seemed harder, although there may have some soft spots. Then I filled the cavities with bondo, sanded and painted. My 2 cents is it is definitely better to use this product than to use nothing at all."
2,Saddened.,"I am so disappointed.I thought this book was going to teach me to improvise characters using Nintendo's style, not just teaching me to draw a few of their characters...now I have to actually think to get their style down right =("
1,booky,"If you haven't met me before, I'm Skullface Mcfireball (sfmf for short). I have this book, and I wouldn't reccomend it. It shows how to draw Mario, Yoshi, Luigi, Toad, DK, and more. But no Bowser! Krog is the most silmilar to him, but I can't belive no Bowser! Who is Krog anyway? whatever, see ya peoples!"
5,my review,This is a really good book with lots of charecters. If you have played a lot of video games and have tried to draw the charecters but couldn't you NEED this book.
4,How To Draw Nintendo Heroes and Villains,"I received exactly what I ordered in a very timely manner. My seven year old wanted to purchase it at his bookfair at school, but it sold out. He was ecstatic, but only drew one picture, because it was a little advanced for him."
3,beautiful set,this is a beautiful set.nicely made with only a couple of issues..the knob on the peppermill crank is much too small.a bit bigger around and taller would be nice..adjustment of grind is not so great;but at least it is decent..other than those 2 design issues;i really like them....really great service from this seller...very fast shipping..
5,Big Bang for Little Bucks,I wanted a little DVD player for my craft room. Nothing fancy. Just something small and basic so that I can play my favorite DVD's while scrapbooking. This DVD player fits the bill perfectly. It sits right on my desk without taking up a lot of space and is VERY QUIET as it plays my DVD's. It is perfect.
1,Bad Product,"Purchased this item a few days ago. My son ran three DVD's through the product and they all have severe scratching on them due to the player. Returned the product for a refund. Unfortunately, replacing the DVDs will cost more than the unit cost to purchase."
1,NO Co-axial connection,"VERY disappointed about this item. The product documentation said it DID have a co-axial connector, but when I got it, it did not! I would never purchase something manufactured by this Company again, and now I'm skeptical of all Amazon wares!"
4,Nice for the price,I have gone through 2 Cyberhome DVD's in the last 13 months.That pretty much says it all.
2,Piece of crap,When first plugged in it did not work. After jiggling with the cord if finally worked. Had to tape down the cord in a certain position to get it to stay on. Dont buy!
4,pretty short,"my grandson loves the video, but I thought it was pretty short for the price. I thought it would be a whole series."
2,Total bummer - these are available online for free!,We were so excited to get this... but didn't realize it was just the first two episodes of the TV show which are available online for free on the Lego site. Bummer!
2,Bummed,"Also completely disappointed to find out that there were only two episodes on this DVD. I figured it would have been the whole season (minus the two final epis), but it's only the first two. Great show, but save your money and wait for the complete series, which I'm sure (now that we bought this) will be out soon."
3,But...,"It is Ok... I like it, buy in the box says that comes in English, French and Spanish, but not. It comes only in English."
5,Lovely,"I felt carried away to a place within and without at the same time, a place I'd forgotten I'd been until I read these poems."
5,Good Editing!,"Good choice of stories! My favs were A BLISTERED SUN, THE EYE, THE LAST CHRISTMAS and UNCLE CAESAR. Some will scare you and others make you cry..but are memorable!Read the editor's SHALL WE GATHER AT THE GARDEN?"
5,Brilliant book,"It's sad that the packaging of this book is so horrible that people may think it's about taxi drivers in New York City taking computer courses. OK, that's based on a stereotype, but people DO judge a book by its cover, and this one may actually kill this book. Give it a chance is my advice. The CD alone is worth the price of admission, as it contains full-motion video of some of the case studies in the book.In my opinion, C K Prahalad is one of the heroes of our generation, but getting the mainstream media interested in this election year is pretty tough indeed. I would love to see him on Charlie Rose (instead of that grotesque James Lipton) but I guess people have to read the book and that would require too much work. He's the real deal."
4,Saving the World,The author loves his TLA's (3 letter acronyms)! I wish someone had told me how technical this book was; those with an MBA will get the most out of it. But I love Prahalad's outlook and creativity. Perhaps with a little advice I can take my ideas and come up with a formal business plan.
4,"Re: ""Give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day...","...teach a man to fish, and he'll eat for a lifetime"" is found nowhere in the Bible, sir.But this is:Better is the poor who walks in his integrity than he who is crooked though he be rich. (Proverbs 28:6)"
2,Suspicious,"The author has noble intentions and some of the arguments are persuasive. But something does not quite add for me:Solve third world poverty by making everyone consumers? Buy more plastic goods?Some of the cases are good stories and I am not against the idea...but something is missing here. What about the mass environmental impact?What about eradicating poverty but increasing impoverishment? Make everyone a consumer, eradicate their customs and culture, Americanize every Third World country by turning its native peoples into consumers. Sounds like a profitable enterprise for the MNCs--but not sure how much ""Fortune"" will be redistributed to the native peoples. I doubt much."
5,My favorite book when I was a kid,"What if the letters A through Z aren't enough for you? Looking for adventure beyond the end of the alphabet? Let Dr. Seuss take you on a guided tour of the letters ""On Beyond Zebra."" Sure, when I was in elementary school some 35 years ago I loved Yertle the turtle and Horton the elephant, but this book was my favorite. For some reason it seems to be harder to find than Seuss' other books -- except at Amazon.com, of course!"
5,Best of Seuss,"A fun book for kids, with some deeper insight as well.""When you go beyond Zebra,Who knows...? There's no tellingWhat wonderful thingsYou might find yourself spelling!"""
4,On Beyond,"The book is in good shape - like new. The cover material is not very sturdy, even for a paper back book."
5,Dr. Seuss was a prophet of unfettered imagination,"If I were to start my own religion, this would probably be the most sacred text. Dr. Seuss possessed powers of pure imagination unequaled in all of children's literature, and this book is the most inspiring, mind-expanding example of his divine gift. Even more important than Cat in the Hat or The Lorax, every baby born into this world should be given a copy of On Beyond Zebra. Buy it and give it to a child you love today!"
5,A frequently overlooked Seuss gem !,"This was my favorite book as a kid & still is. I now have ownership of our family's 'ancient' copy (copyright date 1955, Mom's written inscription: Christmas 1962 for my oldest brother who was age 6). I recently read it to my 6 year old son and he also was taken with this book. I am getting a new copy for him for Christmas as the original is pretty fragile now. This book belongs in every family's collection along with The Lorax, The Sneeches, Bartholomew Cubbins, Horton and the rest of the classic/original Seuss stories."
5,"It's thin, but it works good if you double the layers up",Just got done painting a bunch of baseboards and this plastic film worked great. It's very easy to handle. And there's plenty left over for more painting projects we have planned. If you want want the thin stuff then pay x10 the price for the super thick stuff.
4,Good for the price,"This 20"" flatscreen TV is hard to beat at a price of $450. The picture quality is good and it can be mounted directly onto the wall with a vesa compatible mount (i.e. no additional bracket required). Don't be put off by the dimensions listed as the depth of the actual unit is only about 3"", I can only assume that the dimensions given include the depth of the stand as well.On the downside, the speakers aren't great, there's only two sets of inputs (and no outputs) and the remote is a bit of an archaic brick.All things considered, it's good value for money."
5,Everything I expected and more,"I ordered this tv to be exclusively a bedroom tv, light duty because usually I am so tired I fall right asleep without watching tv, and it is the first flat panel tv I have ever bought. OK, so it arrived and fits very nicely on the shelf in the bedroom closet. Well when I didn't feel well for 2 weeks I watched the tv a lot and it is a good size for a bedroom tv, it has good sound and just an overall good tv with fantastic picture. Overall I recommend this tv to everyone. 20"" is a great size for a bedroom tv."
3,Does'nt Try Hard Enough,"I had high hopes for this movie based on the feedback , the trailer and the cover - but it would like to be a ""Disturbia"" or ""Rear Window"" but it fails to connect .Obviously using a low budget - nothing wrong with that - but at least replace a low budget with some good script . At times the movie dragged a bit - but overall got the American paranoia message across in a dramatic way - worth a look !"
1,Stupid movie,"Even though the movie had great promise - it just fell flat on its face. **Spoiler Warning** In the end the movie is about a deranged person and nothing more. He reported the activity as he should have, but the government would not have reacted as it did, which was to basically blow him off. That does NOT entitle him to break into anyone's house and threaten them at gun point. Why WAS he holding a gun to this guy's head after the police showed up? Hostage negotiators never behave this way - nor do the police in a hostage situation. How the hell did his wife end up with the team that broke in?It was a clumsy way to bring up issues. I felt absolutely no compassion for the lead character - none at all."
2,One of these is not like the others,"I was lured to this cd by the great track, ""The Operator"". It really is a good song, pulsating and melodic. Unfortunately, that is the ONLY song like it on this entire album. It doesn't fit in - or what I should say is that the other 11 tracks don't do ""The Operator"" any justice. It feels like this one song was included as ""the hit"" - and the rest is included, in vain. I don't know who Barbara is, but the first name that jumped out - for comparison sake - is the performance artist Laurie Anderson, who had a song or two back in her day that felt accessible, but whose work was largely anything but. So, to sum up: if you enjoy ""The Operator"", and come to this album expecting more electro-dance type tracks, you'll be very, very disappointed. I was."
1,"Rod Poole ""Dec. '96""",Truly awful. I ordered this CD because I was interested in 'just intonation' guitar music. It consists of one song which is 52 minutes long which was completely improvised. At least 1/4 of the song has him banging and tapping on his guitar. I think he recorded this in his living room (you can hear cars driving by). Nothing melodious at all. Don't waste your money.
1,Caveat Emptor: This isn't Gene Loves Jezebel,"Warning - this is NOT the same people who created such great albums as Discover, House of Dolls, or early goth greats. The ""band"" is really only 1/5th of GLJ, namely Michael Aston, who split in 1989 and someone through crafty legal moves has taken over the GLJ trademark from the other four members of the band. This is like Keith Richards somehow gaining sole rights to the Rolling Stones moniker, and touring and recording under that name without the others. And the musical results are commensurate: stripped bare, song-less noise. You'll be stupefied and shocked and want to run out and overdose on heroin. If you want real GLJ, check out Discover, House of Dolls or Heavenly Bodies instead."
4,Michael Aston Does It Again!!!!!!!!!!,"I have been a Gene Loves Jezebel fan since they played the Ritz in New York in the 80's. I feel both brothers are talented. Michael Aston lyrics, experimental music, and voice are haunting. I would highly recommend this cd along with his other solo projects. It is a shame he is such an underrated artist. True talent lies bleeding."
2,slightly bigger size,"The included package is nice, with cleaning cloth, and finger gloves. However, unlike what the previous reviewer has stated, the protector is about millimeter too long for the GBA SP's screen. Width is a tight fit, but it fits.Another downside is the edges never seem to clamp down all the way. Edges don't stay down and show visble gaps in them.After fumbling and trying to cut the too long protector, I've put too much dust on the sticky side and ended up throwing this thing away."
4,Satisfying,"I work in a small town and, although there are major differences between Pickford County and where I am, the small town allusions in the book ring true. Although one reviewer found the writing choppy, in going from one perspective to the next, I didn't feel like that. I found it interesting to see how each of the characters saw the same event in completely different ways.I especially like the way that Lori is written. Everything comes out nastier than she really meant it to when she says it. It is almost as though teenager-hood is forcing her to be mean and vindictive.The ending does come a bit abruptly, but I was ready for it. The road trip gets tiring after a while - just like it does in real life - and you just want to get home. Fortunately, each one of the characters has learned something. It isn't an overly happy ending, but it is satisfying."
1,Takeoffs and Landings,"Takeoffs and Landings was a boring and monotonous novel, with uninteresting (and what seemed to be unimportant) dialogue and scenes. I found myself listlessly reading pages, and not even remembering what it was I had just read. The plot seemed too cliche-with a fat, made fun of brother, and the beautiful, popular sister uniting in their past. There were flashbacks to their history that seemed to have no importance to the present or future. I do not recomend this book for people that like a good or interesting read, or are advanced readers."
4,Vastly Superior to Stone's Film,"Quentin Tarantino took his name off the Oliver Stone film version of ""Natural Born Killers."" Read this fine screenplay, the one Stone virtually scrapped, and you will understand why. It's tightly focused, where Stone is distractingly all over the map; witty, where Stone is merely crude; deeply shocking and thought-provoking, where Stone is mindlessly sensational. Tarantino reveals himself to be a genuine moralist, of all things. As glamorous as the media finds Mickey and Mallory, Tarantino never lets you forget they are monsters. (Stone caved into the temptation to try to make them ""likable"" by presenting unbelievable, '60's-induced apologies for them.) Nobody gets off the hook in this version. One hopes that someday Tarantino can get the backing to remake the film his way. It should be a classic."
4,One for the bedroom,This man croons........Sweet Little Mystery takes you somewhere your not gonna get too often
5,I bought this as a gift.,"The groom didn't seem to mind that I got him this knife. Then again, he could have just been being polite. Who knows?"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"World's End has some overlap with The Summer Queen and is part of thewhole Snow Queen saga. It is about the lost hyperdrive, and BZGundalinhu and his travel. Some time after the earlier book, he isstill doing his thing.He goes to the planet World's End, andgets infected with an alien virus. The book chronicles his journey andstate of mind as the disease affects him.He comes out the otherend influenced by the odd nature of the planet. If you aren't superkeen on this level of detail for this character, you can just read theSummer Queen instead where you will get bits of this, quickly."
5,Great game for all ages!,"One of my sons rec'd this game as a birthday gift earlier this year. We tucked it away and forgot about it. This summer we found it and thought it might be a good boredom buster. We LOVE this game! It's easy to learn, fun to play and kids can play it unsupervised. They have to think and use strategy and logic. The game moves at a good pace and you have some flexibility in making the game shorter if necessary. I have 5 children. My oldest three (2 boys and a girl)are ages 9, 7, and 5 and they have LOVED this game. Now we want to stock up on Nacho Loco so we can give it as birthday gifts!"
4,Family fun,"I bought this to keep at our cottage for a rainy day game. The first time we played it we had guests over, it was getting late, and the kids were getting bored. We had several children, ranging from as young as 4 and as old as 14 playing, along with 2 adults. We had a blast. This is an easy to learn, yet fun game. It's great for visual learners... Great value, too!"
5,Client-Centered Therapy.,"The Client-Centered Therapy: Its Current Practice, Implications, and by Carl Rogers was in good condition and an interesting book. Thanks."
5,From Mexico,"Es un excelente libro, para mi como estudiante de psicología me ha ayudado bastante a comprender la terapia centrada en el cliente, lo recomiendo a todos los estudiantes de esta bellisima carrera"
3,"Good looking, with some quality issues","This is a great looking faucet, however ours has a few issues. The ""quick release"" system used that connects the sprayer, faucet and handle worked great the first install. When we took the faucet out due to transfer over to the new sink, the quick release system leaked from all 3 points. Don't know why it's called a quick release when it is only a one-time use part. Price Pfister's fix listed on their website is to buy a new quick release system for $25 (after shipping).Even worse, the faucet slowly starter to seperate at the base of the faucet spout causing water to spray all over the kitchen. I have epoxied the hairline crack and I'm awaiting Price's response to my warranty claim. Additionally, the soap dispenser container has also starter to crack at the threading. Sigh. Other than those issues, it looks great."
1,Tastless!,I am sorry to say that this product was dry and tastless! I would not recommend it to anybody.
5,"""Back in time""","This is an excellent music and is able to take you back in time to remember. Great experience, and is still able to make your heart beat faster."
5,An album for those in search of a 'lost' masterpiece.,"Woyaya positively sparkles with the enjoyment and enthusiasm of the musicians. What you hear is the vibrancy of black cultures from West Africa and the West Indies colliding in the damp and cold of London in the early seventies, and considerably raising the studio temperature. Producer Tony Visconti adds only his trade-mark dynamism and stands well back as Ghana meets Antigua meets Nigeria meets Grenada, and everybody discovers each other and chase away the gloom.Quite simply, every time I hear African 'world' music today, I think, 'yeah, ok...but its not Woyaya!'"
3,I was hoping for more,"I found that this book was valuable more for the primary sources it referenced than any insights from Williams. Not to say that Williams didn't have anything insightful to say, but his primary job seemed to be drawing the reader's attention to what these three men said rather than offering deep commentary on what they said."
4,The Life of the crazed assassin Tsafendas.,"The killing of Prime Minister Verwoerd of South Africa in 1966 was considered a blow against white supremacy. In fact, it was the work of a crazed assassin who was acting on his own notions.The assassin Tsafendas was a half breed of Greek/black descent who was torn apart between both races. His illegimacy was also a source of tension in his life. Both factors contributed to stress on his mind and the result was the killing of the Prime Minister of South Africa.This was a little known event in the rest of the world but traumatic in South Africa. Tsafendas by thrusting his knife into Verwoerd demonstrated his hatred of a system that hurt him.Tsafendas was a lunatic, but his action showed the resistance of some to white supremacy. The book is a short but good read about a little known event."
1,golf ball hog,"the golf ball hog in theory is a great idea. in practice, however, it is quite fragile. i have broken two under what i would consider normal work load. they break where the rake attaches to the narrowest extension. it would be nice if it could be beefened up substantially at that junction. i would readily pay 2 to 3 times more for a golf ball hog that was a durable one, not a fragile one."
3,Ball Hog,"This looks like an excellent product. However, the golf course where I play is full of slime. It is not possible to get the ball hog down far enough to retrieve the ball. Would probably work well under other conditions."
1,golf BALL HOG,"not heavy enough. When rake gets to bottom and you start to pull, rake takes off and comes to surface of water. Not a very good product. Should have known, ""As Seen on Television"">"
3,Golf ball retriever,"Ball retriever works ok, but ad said that it was an 18 foot long one.In fact it was only 15 feet long.Ad was wrong."
2,Golf Ball Hog,The golf ball hog did not perform in my golf course ponds. It would make a great ball retriever out of the water. I need something for the water because that is where everyone loses there balls.Wayne Phillips
2,It is hard to work compared to my other retreivers,My other retrievers are easy to put out there and get the golf balls
2,Not great but really the only option.,"This product is not great. There are MANY editing errors as well as simple inaccuracies. (Sensory nerves labeled as motor, etc.) It is clear that the book was never edited by a neurologist. (At least not a competent one). However, I don't know that there is a good alternative for the neuro shelf exam. I went through the entire book and I got just above the national mean."
2,pre test neurology,"in my opinion this product is not satifactory because is much superficialy. if you have a product in video, please tell me.thank you Silvana"
5,Put this in the cookbook hall of fame!,"I've owned this cookbook for 10+ years, and I have to have given at least 10 copies over the years as gifts.Timeless recipes from great cooks that were tested repeatedly amongst JL members and their families. One of the guidelines for selecting recipes for testing was that the ingredients were relatively easy to find.I've made the majority of the recipes time and again, always to rave reviews (I'd love to take credit but it's not me, it's the recipes:)Casual to fancy, this is a cookbook that I use as frequently today as I did when I first purchased it. You'll be pleased, I promise."
3,"Good, but definitely NOT an Ozarks cookbook","This cookbook has a lot of good general recipes, but most of them are not Ozarks recipes. Sure, there are recipes for chicken and dumplings, meatloaf, and Jell-O salads (all of which were foods on the table in my Ozarks childhood); but there are twice as many recipes for boeuf bourgignonne, moussaka, and Italian goodies--all great foods, of course, but certainly not Ozarkian. I love lasagne as much as the next guy, but I'll consult an Italian cookbook for that recipe, not an ""Ozarks"" cookbook. All the recipes I've tried look and taste great. It's just that if you are looking for a true Ozarks cookbook, don't look here."
2,Night After Night VHS,I was very disappointed in this video. If your fond of George Raft it is great. If it's Mae West your interested in there is not much of her in this video. The copy I received had some flutters in it as well.
1,"Good video game, Bad anime",The anime is just plain crap! It doesn't follow the video game and it twelve episodes were so lame. It's bad just like Arc the Lad anime.
2,misssk,"I felt like I walked in late to a class. I think they divided a seminar up into different cds. They discuss things from prior seminar, as if you already heard it. I listened to it twice because I thought maybe I missed something. There was some good information."
2,Too Much,"Motorhead, is good every once in a while. This is way to much Motorhead for any one to handle. They are good but not that talented. I regret not just buying a single best of CD and saving 20 bucks"
5,Motorhead going strong for over 30 years,"Motorhead are one of the hardest working bands of all time. They have pumping out music for over 30 years. And this boxset proves it to a ""T"". So crank it !!! Lemmy & boys show no signs of slowing down. I even put them up there with the Rolling Stones. Prove Me Wrong !!!!"
5,A must have for the TRUE fan!,"I have been a Motorhead fan since 1995 (when Metallica covered Overkill for Lemmys' B-Day bash!). I had never heard of Motorhead until then, and now, I am a TRUE fan forever withover 70 albums from around the world! This BOX SET is a MUST HAVE!!! This thing kills anything in it's path! Orgasmatron 2000 absolutely blows the original version out of the water! Hell on Earth, where has this evil track been hiding! This is everything you could want in Motorhead!"
4,Pretty awesome!,"This necklace isnt my favorite one in my collection, but I do like it a lot. There's nothing wrong with it, it's just not as pretty as some of the others on this website in my opinion. This also arrived with the white orb thing the dragon is cradling broken off. Some super glue fixed that right up and ive had no problems since. Very awesome, but not my absolute favorite"
1,Ew & Double Ew!!!,"In our household we eat a LOT of vegan and vegetarian products. I was excited to see this product & brought it home to give it a try. It is absolutely disgusting! It went right from the blender into the garbage can. I will stick to my homemade puddings made with Silk. It tastes just like vanilla tofu, great if you want to eat a bowl of sugary-sweet vanilla tofu, gross if you want to eat pudding. I've never given a product a bad review, but this one I just had to say this is THE most disgusting product I have ever had, and not just out of vegan products, out of all products. Ew! Even the dogs wouldn't touch this and they eat carrots & broccoli stalks!"
2,"good acting, but borring","good acting, but it did get borring 20 min into the movie, i had to force myself to keep watching."
5,Natural Treat My Dogs Love!,"These treats are all natural - no harmful additives, meat parts, etc. My dogs love them and I can feel good about giving them."
2,Beware!,"I purchased this unit about 1.5 years ago. Both dvd and vcr played well for about 1 year. Then the dvd player stopped reading the dvds. I cleaned the unit and it still didn't help. For awhile you could watch the dvd and half way through the movie it would just freeze up. The machine would be really hot. You could turn it off, the machine would cool off and then try again. The same thing would happen. NOW, nothing happens. When you put the disc in, it does nothing. It just makes a clicking sound... The vcr works fine. No problem with it eating the tapes as others have. I am very annoyed, because now I have a vcr that works, with the dvd that doesn't. I don't want to stack another dvd player on top or to the side, and I hate to throw away a vcr that works fine..."
1,Tape Eater,"I bought this unit yesterday. Installation and instructions were very easy. We watched a DVD last night with good picture quality. However, it ate the first two VHS tapes that I put into it! Needless to say, I will be returning this item today. It could be a fluke with this particular player, but I don't think I'm willing to try another."
2,As Dry as the Sumerians Homeland,"This book was written so dry, I couldnt finish it. I always finish a book and I made it to the last fifty pages. But decided my time had more important books to read. The University of Chicago Press should be your first clue that the writing style will put you to sleep.Page 208 reads:It may, of course, have first been composed considerably earlier-was divided by the ancient scribe into four columns. It contains two compositions of unequal size separated by a ruled line. The first and longer of the two consists of 112 lines of text, whereas the second has only 66 lines. Following the text of the two compositions, and separated from it by a double line, is a three-line colophon giving the title of each of the compositions as well as the number of lines which they contain individually and together.I threw the book in the trash. How you can take a subject as interesting as the Sumerians and make it so boring? Only a college professor could do it."
4,A good introduction,"Kramer provides a brief survey of the history of ancient Sumer. Even though this book is listed as archeology, he gleans most of his narrative from literary sources. It includes a history of the area from early dynastic times down to the time of Hammurabi, as well essays on Sumerian literature, education, religion, and so forth. Kramer writes very elegantly and includes a large collection of primary sources, making this book, despite its age, one of the best on its subject. On the other hand, it is a rather old book, and there are some subjects where Kramer's interpretations do not seem to have been accepted by more recent scholars, for instance his theories about Magan, Meluhha, and Dilmun. Despite this, his book is a good introduction to the history of Sumer, worthy of a read by anyone who is or thinks they might be interested in the subject."
2,almost unreadable,"The author covered the minutae in such a convoluted way that this book, for me, was unreadable. The use of double negatives at every opportunity was maddeningly annoying. I pity any student who has been assignedthis textbook, which is what it essentially is."
3,A Significant Work,"A significant piece of work that dramatically expanded the horizons of my knowledge of civilized cultures. However, the writing is difficult to enjoy with frequent use of double negatives and simple transitional phrase ""not infrequently"" used. The read was worth the work."
5,Wow!,What else could I say than what you see!? Amazing...excellent sound quality! One of the best live DVD's I have ever seen (and I have many)!!
4,"Dido live, a good introduction to Dido","I was not that familiar with Dido, but had seen a clip from this video that caught my attention so I bought it. I was not dissappointed, as it is well done, good sound, and fun to watch. Dido not my generation, but enjoyed the video."
5,Dido Doesn't Disappoint,"The DVD and CD are both fantastic, you won't be disappointed. In fact, my 8 year old daughter and I like several of the live versions better than the originals. Plus, I think Dido is very personable, cute, and sexy, which doesn't hurt. On the other hand, she doesn't flaunt her attractiveness, which is a relief for a father of a young girl these days. I can't wait until her next album."
1,ALERT: Audio CD contains spyware,"The DVD is great, but the Audio CD that comes with it contains the SunnComm spyware, which installs silently, is hidden, informs SunnComm of your listening behavior, and is near impossible to remove. So, don't play this Audio CD on your PC! No problems if you play it on a normal CD player."
5,Dido for your own viewing/listening pleasure,"I have to admit it, I love Dido's music, her first album No Angel was brilliant, and Life for Rent second album really grew on me and is a favorite on my playlist.This concert CD is a pleasure to watch, her concert performance is inspired, with just enough changes/tweaks to her songs that even though I've practically memorized her songs, it was new and refreshing. The picture quality was a bit soft played on 100"" projector screen, but it kind of works in light of her musical style. The bonus of an Audio CD in the package is great, and makes this a great value. The sound quality of the CD is decent for a concert live CD. It's not the clearest sounding live CD, but the overall tonally balance is listenable.Dido's performance was great on this DVD, and watching her performance makes me love her music even more. A must for a Dido fan."
3,Soft focus HELL,"I like everything I've heard by Dido. She has a great, smoky voice and all of her songs performed here are deeply beautiful. It's good to finally see how she is in a live setting. Unfortunately, the widescreen image is heavily processed with a soft focus throughout, which I detest. Still, she looks terrific and the audio quality is generally good. Mmmm, and I especially love her performance here of ""Take My Hand"" - I wouldn't mind being her ""microphone"" during it, ohhhhhh baby.....BEWARE!!! ATTENTION!!! READ THIS!! - DO NOT LOAD THE LIVE MUSIC CD INTO YOUR PC. IT CONTAINS SUNNCOMM / MEDIAMAX SONYBMG ROOTKIT SPYWARE, WHICH WILL SCREW YOUR SYSTEM UP! DAMN THESE COMPANIES TO HELL!"
2,lacking,i cant bilieve someone like dido would let such a cocert like this happen shes smarter her show needs to be more amazing like the blue man group nine inch nials or tool but still i'd like to bag her day and night thats all that really matters sex without sincerity
5,Dido live rocks,"Includes songs from ""No Angel"" and ""Life for Rent"". Watch the DVD for info on a few of the songs. Then listen to the CD and enjoy."
5,good show,"great show, hilarious....kids love it...wish the streaming was better however...glad amazon has season 2 and above, been harder to find"
1,Too Much Toilet Humor,"I am sorry if I am offending anybody through writing this customer review, and if I have hurt anyone's feelings I sincerely apologize. However, I personally think that ""Fanboy and Chum Chum"" could be a much more humorous cartoon, maybe even something remniscent of the television programs that aired during the 1990s, if some of the toilet humor was dropped. I normally laugh at anything that comes out of the toilet and occasionally enjoy a nice, strong kindergarten ""potty joke,"" but this cartoon often seems to overuse gross-out humor. Also, many of the episodes' plots are nothing more than parodies of famous films or television series hallmarks, or at least they contain snippets of obvious parodies of such media. I am sorry if I have offended anybody."
5,QUINTESSENTIALLY PHENOMENAL,"Meshell N'Degeocello IS without question one of the sexiest, most progressive, creative minds in the music arena. When so much of the New Millennium's music dives to the leechy depths of misogyny, extreme materialism, cultural and political ignorance and an overall lack of the qualities that render music an artform, everything that this woman composes is GENIUS...creative expression at its very, very best - - - unbelievable production that fuses everything from jazz to reggae to the native rhythms of the Motherland and lyrics that demand that you take your mind to a deeper level."
3,Grows On You,"Unique in a lot of ways.Takes getting used to. Most of the tracks just kept getting skipped for a while, but surprisingly, they grow on you. If you are open to a wide variety and artiste's experimenting various style, go for it."
4,...,"This is the first Meshell Ndegeocello album I have bought. (When I discover new artists, I usually start from the most present to the older stuff...) At first, I absolutely hated it and I put it away for quite awhile. I listened to it again... still nothing. Today, I gave it a final listen and absolutely loved it. You really have to be in a certain mood to appreciate this album. You have to be feeling very relaxed, yet still attentive. The project is short and sweet. The insturmentation and vocals are beautiful. If you don't like it at first, try again. I am so enthused that I am now going to buy all of her other albums. I highly recommend Comfort Woman."
1,horrible singer,"All I know is that this girl stunk up the Motown songs she sang on ""Standing in the Shadows of Motown"". She almost singlehandedly ruined the entire movie (and that is saying alot, because it is damn good). Thankfully, Gerald Levert more than offset her pathetic performances. She also came off as clueless when it came to classic soul. And wearing the sunglasses and the skull cap indoors during interviews and the concert. Pathetic. If she had talent, she wouldn't have to rely on ""style"" to simulate coolness."
5,Amazing & Ethereal,"This is one of the very best CDs I have heard since Jill Scott's first CD in terms of loving almost every track. This album takes you to another realm when you listen. It's amazing. This thing is a masterpiece. Especially loving ""Come Smoke My Herb"" right now. Words can't describe..."
5,Yet another blissful release by Meshell,"What I find fascinating about this album is the way it uses it's time: wisely. Clocking under 40 minutes and just ten tracks, the uncultivated consumer might be left wishing for more -- this sentiment is so, not the case if you actually emerse yourself in the material. Meshell does not disappoint on this studio album at all. It flows from beginning until end and takes you on a lovely musical journey. The record aches with soul and is Meshell's foray into electronic acoustic expression. I love the ""Love Songs"" and I can't get enough of ""Lilliquoi Moon"" (a thinly veiled Lisa Bonet reference?) and the album as whole has this calming, outerwordly vibe. Meshell's activist spirit burns on with ""Fellowship"" (""if you believe that your God is better than another man/how you gon' end all your suffering and strife?"") Meshell's lines in the closing track, ""I just want to be happy...thankful"" aptly sums up the album's ethos. I am happy I purchased this LP."
3,"ok, not her best work","I liked Cookie better than this one. She still has talent, but this CD is not good. Perhaps she was depressed, well Take some uppers or something!! Me'Shell, place come back with a better CD! This is way to down, and not all that good, What a waste of good talent."
2,Disappointed,"Let me begin by saying I have all her stuff, and she probably is my favorite ""underground"" artist. This sucks. It seems like she and whoever were jamming and just pulled out the tape. Where's teh creativity? That psuedo reggae sound is weak. She almost matched the disappoinment of Batter, I mean Bitter. I'm glad I bought it used. I feel insulted. And I'm trying to be nice. Meshell, what's up? Damn. Who is this music for? Get a band and jam. F**k this simple simon sound."
3,A lightweight insight to how the movie was made,"A bit lightweight on the secrets and techniques being discussed, cinefex this ain't.There's lots of great colour pictures help this book feel like good value for money. The pictures of alternative Newborn designs are of particular interest as they are far superior to the white 'muppet' that appeared in the movie. The emphasis is firmly on the pictures rather than text descriptions of hwo the special effects were made and detailed discussions with the creators. It'd be a great book if it was as detailed as say 'alien the special effects'."
4,AN INTERESTING READ ABOUT BEHIND THE SCENES,"I THINK THAT ANDREW MURDOCK AND RACHEL ABERLY DO A GOOD JOB OF SHOWING THE READER ALL THE SETS, COSTUMES, SFX AND MODELS THAT ARE USED IN THIS MOVIE. THE BOOK IS PACKED WITH DRAWINGS, SKETCHES AND PHOTOS THAT SHOW US HOW SOME OF THE GREAT SETS AND EFFECTS ARE BROUGHT TO THE BIG SCREEN. ALOT OF THE INTERVIEWS ARE WITH THE TECHNICAL PEOPLE WHO USE SOME SHOP TALK TO DESCRIBE HOW THE LIGHTING, CAMERA ANGLES, ATMOSPHERIC COLOR AND MOODS ARE CREATED. I MOSTLY ENJOYED THE PHOTOS AND DRAWINGS OF THE NEWBORN AND HOW IT WAS SO SUCESSFULLY USED IN THE MOVIE. I HAVE READ THE MAKING OF MANY OTHER MOVIES AND THIS BOOK IS ONE OF THE BETTER ONES. HOPEFULLY SOME DAY ANOTHER ALIEN MOVIE WILL BE MADE WITH SIGOURNEY WEAVER WHO SUCH A WONDERFUL ACTRESS PLAYING RIPLEY. I WOULD LIKE TO THE LAST MOVIE REVOLVE AROUND THE HUMANS ATTEMPT TO ERADICATE THE ALIENS ONCE AND FOR ALL ON THE ALIEN'S HOME WORLD IN ALL OUT WAR FOR SURVIVAL. THE WINNER TAKES ALL."
3,"Low on steamy romance, but a great casual read ...","If you're looking for hot, page-turning romance - look elsewhere ... this book has a predictable storyline that is great for a casual summer read. Classic case of boy-meets-girl, but I really liked how Capt Kurt Northway is not obsessed with sexual motives."
2,Boring,"The story was ok, but it was boring because they did not get into the nitty griity until the last chapter . hot scenes were not there just a lot of beating around the bush . would not recommend . not Nan Ryan's usual style. Please write some new books ."
2,Disappointing,"Being a Dance Anthems fan and regular listening to the show on BBC's Radio 1, I had high expectations for this 3CD set. Sadly, the majority of the tunes were generic, plain, and uninspiring. 90% of the CD set is just plain. Dave finally turns up the volume around the last 5 songs on the 3rd CD.For those who haven't heard Dave's show on BBC Radio1, the CD set might be ok. Those who have heard his radio show will be disappointed."
5,Easy on the knees,"This is exactly what I want - fits me, fits the toilet, easy to clean! Excellent service - quick and free delivery! How did I live without a computer, without Amazon.com!"
2,Not for everyone,"I was disappointed in this book. The build up was so big, that I probably couldn't help but be.My biggest disagreement was in the chapter on ""respect"". It was all about how to ""make"" your child respect you and said *nothing* about respecting your child. If you except your children to respect you, you must respect their worth and dignity. I found his methods in this chapter to be possibly acceptable with very young kids, but I pity the parent who tries them on adolescents.As with most books on parenting, this should be taken with a salt shaker and a good understanding of your own children and yourself."
2,Okay read,I thought the book was basic knowledge reinforced. I also thought the book spoke more closely to adult relationships rather than adult and child relationships and interactions.
1,Don't waste your time ...,"Don't believe the glowing reviews of this ""pamphlet"".This book was a complete waste of time . The author does not give any concrete ideas or suggestions to help parents implement his ideas.This approach may well work within the confines of martial arts instructions and lessons but on it's own it doesn't stand up. I... I read it in under an hour,(quite possible since it is a pamphlet double spaced in order to fool the reader into thinking it is a book). I...it may well be an excellent pamphlet for his students and their families. Also the authuor needs a good editor!!! . ..."
3,Some Helpful Techniques for Getting Kids to Cooperate,"The author offers some sensible strategies that can lead to better comunication with children as well as adults. As an experieced middle school teacher and mother of 3 boys, I honestly did not find anything new in this book. I think this book falls short in the amount of helpful information as compared to many other respected classic parenting books that focus on positive discipline techniques. I recommend 3 different books for that purpose that seem to embrace a similar philosophy of this author but give you so much more ""meat"" in the number of strategies, tips and examples offered. Those books are...How to Talk So Kids Will Listen (by Faber and Mazlish), Loving Your Child Is Not Enough (by Nancy Samalin) and Between Parent and Child (by Haim Ginott). These 3 books have helped keep our family sane. We refer to them over and over again as situations arise with our children."
5,Loved It,"I loved this book. I am a parenting book addict and I have to admit that when I got this book in the mail I was a little disapointed by the size of it. It really is not that thick. What the book lacks in volume however, it makes up for in substance.The power of a book like this is the straightforward manner of its message and the departure from what you expect to get in a parenting book. The Child Whisperer lays out in simple language how to get better results with your kids. This book ""clicked"" with me and since reading it, I have shared it with a few friends who have loved it too."
1,Martial arts instructor writes a psychology pamphlet,"This book was nearly a complete waste of time. The author is a martial arts instructor in Dayton, Ohio. He advocates not expressing emotions in communications. This approach may well work within the confines of martial arts class but in dealing with children at school or at home it doesn't stand up. It is not real. Try ""Parent Effectiveness Training"" by Thomas Gordon for a practical book about raising responsible children with high self-esteem. However, it was interesting to me to read a sincerely stated point of view, no matter how different.When the students of the author place favorable reviews here to boost up the rating of the book, I feel disappointed because I rely on the Amazon review system to give me accurate information about a book. Some of the reviews here are disingenuous."
4,As tasty and decadent as a chocolate cake,"I love these carrot cakes. I order them here as well as straight from their website. It has this awesome glaze that reminds me of chocolate. It is fresh. Feel free to warm it in the oven.The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of the 5 is the texture...it is very crumbly. It is a hit or miss for me to cut a slice without it falling apart. Now, this could be me not using the right utensils.Other than that: Taste, Freshness, Customer Service, Product Delivery - all 5 stars!"
3,Interesting Beginnings,"Having listened to the latest Gaelforce CD on offer, I was interested to find out the origins of such a scintillating peice of musical genius. However, the sketchy beginnings inherent in this CD are not as intriguing as those highly polished tunes present in the later sister CD.The most noticeable feature of this CD is its strong traditional zest... drawing from the irish heritage and melding it with a very interesting style of Jazz. A most interesting choice - having said that I did however find it difficult to move into this unconventional style of music, but after a while, the beat is as infectious as with other big show compositions.If you are looking for a contemporary explosion of remixed Celtic music - move on. This is not Lord of the Dance style, but rather a more traditional, culturally rich composition. It is great for Irish dancers and those who enjoy traditional Irish music."
5,I left my heart at 84 Charing Cross Road,"A MUST READ FOR YOUNG WRITERS. Reading this book is one of the best things I have ever done for myself. As a writer and an avid reader, Helene Hanff's quick wit and dry sense of humor was not only a lesson on how to keep your reader interested; it is a real writer's block ice-breaker for me!The correspondence between Helene Hanff and the staff at the 84 Charing Cross Road book store are short and to the point letters about particular books, but the relationship that develops between characters is heartfelt and you can very easily put yourself in her shoes. I found myself spellbound. I read it in one afternoon.Treat yourself to a wonderful easy read. A good book to follow up with after this is ""Apple of My Eye"" also by Helene Hanff. Even if you have never been to New York City before she will take you there.I give both books 5 stars and can't wait to read the rest of her books!Donna RaskinKansas City, MO"
4,Bill Burrud Explores the Amazing Animal World: The Secret World of Reptiles,"I'm not sure what tape the other reviewer saw, but from his/her description it sounds very little like the Bill Burrud tape that I've seen. Released as part of a series on the Walt Disney Home Video label over 20 years ago, this is an informative if somewhat naive and a perhaps a tad outdated overview of various members of the scaly-skinned clan with whom we share this planet. It's done very much in the spirit of the Disney-produced nature films of the '50s and early '60s, like 'The Living Desert.' No, not as flashy or exciting as, say, the late, great Steve Irwin's programs, but a solid, well-photographed primer for youngsters interested in matters herpetological."
4,Keeps on gettin' hot-ter,"Study of Louisianna's musical past typically revolves around New Orleans. BGP's most recent comp, ""Southern Funkin',"" avoids Nawlins-cetricity by collecting lost funk and soul gems from the rest of Louisianna. With its large African-American population and considerable number of indepedent record labels, Louisianna was a force in soul music. This collection offers remarkable local flavor--especially the strong dose of bayou. Instead of James Brown knockoff after James Brown knockoff, this collection has a sense of dynamics absent from most regional collections. While Louisianna isn't quite the collector's fav region (like Texas or other areas), ""Southern Funkin"" serves up a generous portion of funk and grooves. Highlights: ""Black Water Gold"" by African Music Machine and ""Put it On"" by ""Count"" Rockin' Sidney with The Dukes.Highly recommended!"
4,He had fun with this!,"My nephew-in-law was delighted when he opened this. As far as we could tell, he was having lots of fun with it! The combination of cars and monsters is always appealing to little boys. Thank you so much!"
3,Walks Far - From Movie,"While this book itself is interesting, anyone hoping to read the movie that was made of this, are in for a disappointment. The movie was fleshed out a lot more than the book, and any number of things are not as they were shown in the film.Nevertheless, it is an interesting book even though it tends to be a bit cut and dried.C.R. Melcher"
5,"Best of the best of...,","This wonderful ""cheap"" Spectrum compilation of the authentic 50'sPlatters is a real treasure. The absolutely best DooWop group of alltimes (with the best black voice ever of Tony Williams) can be foundon this CD with unbeatable quality. More than half of the Platters'Greatest are in full stereo although we're still in the fifties!!All the charting hits are there. This is a ""must"" for all recordcollectors!!"
4,biggest rice bowls I've ever seen,"I have all the switch 3 dishes, and was excited to add the rice bowls to my set. They're beautiful to use as cereal bowls but are WAY too big to use as rice bowls."
2,Too thin,I bought 2 12' rolls. Not very happy. The material is too thin. It doesn't lay down flat and not heavy enough to stay put.
3,Fisher Price Fanny Pack,"This item endured for about 9 months, before the belt began to tear away from the cooler. I would recommend continue to look for a more durable belt pack."
4,Curse of the Mekons/F.U.N. '90,"The Mekons again display their amazing talent. ""Wild and Blue"" is amazing."
1,Poor.,"I like the majority of William C. Davis works but this work is not a good effort. It does not even begin to focus on the Natchez trace, does not adequately describe the impact of the city of Natchez on the early Southern frontier, ignores the separateness that characterized early southwestern America and barely touches on the existence of another road, the Military Road from Charleston to Mobile to New Orleans that had just as much impact on the settlement and development of this portion of the early southwestern United States. Whew, that was a mouthful!Unfortunately, these are the high points of this book. The book is poorly written, disorganized and follows no chronological sequence. If you are interested in the fascinating history of early Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, consider The Old Southwest, 1795-1830 by Thomas D. Clark and John D. W. Guice. It appears that many passages of Davis' book are lifted directly from it."
1,Horrible,"It's not worth it, at all. The author comes across as a pompous a-hole. If you want a great book by an author that really cares about his significant other's pregnancy, check out ""Dad's Pregnant Too!"""
2,looking for something serious ; look somewhere else,"if you are looking for something serious ; look somewhere else , Writer Michael just shares his 9 month memories in a crack way, it is not all serious advices , it is not a serious guide.. just fun if you can laugh !? .. ( alhought he mentiones that he is not a doctor or specialist on pregn. or childhood )"
3,"Cheesy, shallow, unhelpful, and a couple of forced laughs...","Let me start that I traded my ""Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads"" by Gary Greenberg for this book with a friend that is also expectiing. Needless to say, that was a very poor trade, and I want my old book back.Whether the Greenberg book is full of useful information about how to best dispose of soiled diapers, how to baby-proof a hotel room in minutes, etc, ""The Guy's Guide to Surviving Preegnancy"" reads more like a series of blog-posts by a clueless guy. Basically, this is NOT a ""guide"" to anything.Somewhere in there the author talks about how is struggling to achieve the target word-count for the publisher, and he's not kidding.Three stars go to the super-cute cover!!!"
1,Royalty Check,"After reading this book, the reviews, and the author's comments on reviews I have 3.5 hours of my life that I will never get back. If you are looking for an informational, helpful guide, this is not the book for you. This was a gift I wish I hadn't received! I will not recommend this book to anyone. I also find it disappointing that the author repeatedly responds to negative reviews with ""I still get the royalty check""."
1,Do Not Buy This Book,"Shame on this guy for not stepping out of his own skin and having a little sympathy for his pregant wife. I couldn't even finish this book. It reminded me of some guys I play softball with..totally hung up on themselves, avoiding their wives and children, drinking Budweiser and getting away with it. Of all the ignorance. Who prints this crap? File this one under Dumb People Who Write Books."
1,"Decent humor, little information","This book provides a somewhat funny look at the author's experience with the birth of his first child. I think the title is misleading, however, as there is very little practical information that an expectant father needs to know. Essentially, it's a light-hearted memoir of the experience, and after a while, the author's limited playbook of joke structures wore thin on me.Don't waste your money."
2,"More Robinton? No, thanks.","Buy it if you're a Pern collector, but otherwise give it a miss. Very standard Choose-Your-Own-Adventure fare, and Robinton's not presented as a very interesting hero."
3,the book is better,Fine actors excellent dvd the faults are in the film. But if you love the B movies of the era it's still highly enjoyable.
2,nice idea but doesn't work very good,"this is a nice idea if it was for bigger cords. But even my hair dryer cord wouldn't fit into it. It only works for narrow, short cords. So your computer cords won't work in it. It was also hard to turn. I put the ones I bought in the junk drawer because I don't need a winder for my small cords, they are small. I bought three different types of cord winders and none of them would handle my computer cords. They all only worked on very small cords, so my computer cords are still a mess."
3,I like Stratham so I give it three stars,"Ok, I did not find it as rotten as some say it is but is is not that good as some say it is either. I am of the view that Stratham is an actor well liked by many and as such one leans towards giving a good review because he is in the movie. However, the movie is something like Harry Potter with magic and sorcery. Although Stratham did his best, it fell far short of his other movies."
3,"In the NAME of FUN, this movie is not bad","It's not bad if you think you're watching a PG-13 movie. That means the fighting scenes can't be bloody and exciting as a real action movie. Yes, it copies quite a few things from Lord of the Ring. For example, The mud-people -- aka the Krug -- look very much like the Orcs. The female-tree characters are obviously imitation of the tree charactes in Lord of the Ring.However, the magic fighting scene between Ray Liotta and John Rhys-Davis looks original to me.In the NAME of FUN, this film is worth watching once."
1,one of the worst movies i have ever seen,i dont know what to say that has not already been said better by someone else but i thought this movie was terrible. i was looking forward to it because i really like the game it was based on but it was just terrible bad acting bad plot bad everything. one of the biggest disappointments of my life.
2,A Disappointment,"A truely disappointing movie. I thought I couldn't go wrong with a Jason Statham action movie, but I was. But maybe it was because I got the uncut, director's version; it was way too long. The story was a little confusing, but that could be do to me dozing off at various points. I expect battle scenes that involve swords, axes, and arrows to be more gruesome. No blood splattering here. The Krugs looked rather lame and they didn't give us an understanding of them. The king's nephew was Shaggy from Scooby Doo (hey, I've got kids), which was just weird. And Burt Reynolds was in it. I thought he was dead. Well, he could have been. Ray Liota as the bad guy? I didn't know evil could be so boring. All told, not a movie I'd buy. But I did. Curses!"
2,Yikes,"Yikes! That's all I could think while watching this weird Lord of the Rings rip-off. I was intrigued because Jason Statham was in this, I kept expecting this to get better, but it didn't. Why I watched this until the end is beyond me."
1,Some actors lost a bet,"I understand needing to pay rent, even actors need to. But wow...this is a bad movie of mythological proportions. I feel like sending a sympathy card to each cast member. I am so, so sorry."
5,Very good movie,"I do not know why so many people hate this movie. But I really enjoyed it. It is not as good as Lords of the ring and Matrix. But it is much better than Avatar. There are good fights, manhood, womanhood, evil, knighthood, whatever you are looking for.Nowadays, hollywood directors create crap movies like 007 James Bond, Avatar, Inception, Mission impossible, Fast and Furious, Hunger Games, Star Wars, Star Trek. Some really good low budget movies get underated all the time. Shame on this hollywood!"
4,"Geez, people, it's not that bad...","My family enjoyed this movie as it is exactly what it was designed to be...entertaining. Geez, people, it's just a fantasy story about a kingdom, monsters and magic...how award-winning do you think it should be? The acting was not bad, and it did have a lot of big names in it, which was neat to see. The magical special effects were quite nice, too. We enjoyed this movie as fans of action-adventure flicks. Fun way to spend an evening. It certainly was not awful, as some reviewers have said."
1,Worse Than The Power Rangers Movie,"I am not going to waste my time writing a long review. However, at first glance of the ""monsters"" in this flick, you will think you are watching a very cheap Mighty Morphin Power Rangers type kiddie-show. Turn off the tape...and back away quickly! Stratham is one of my personal favorites....but he sure does have a few stinkers! If you are a fan of Stratham - check out The Bankjob! It is stellar!"
1,Painful...Just Painful.,"You know that nasty, bilious, semi-queasy feeling you get whenever Steve Carell is messing up The Office, taking valuable screen time away from Jim, Pam, Dwight & the crew? Yeah, that goes away after Michael shuts up.This just went on, and on, and on. If you feel compelled to watch it, take three parts vodka to 4 parts Pepto-Bismol, shake, strain over ice & garnish with lime. Medicate as needed to get through to the end of this Plotless, poorly conceived, poorly shot, horribly written, 3rd rate CGI'd, cheesy, predictable, cliche' infested disaster. John Rhys Davies & Burt Reynolds looked like they would have liked to burn their agents at the stake for getting them attached to this mess, and with good reason. And what, in the name of Our Glorious God, was The Transporter doing in this mess? Transporter 3 would have been a much better use of Jason Statham's time.(as the consummate damnation- DOOM was better. I cannot believe I said that.)"
1,Don't waste your time or $$,I really like Jason Statham but this movie is a complete waste of time unless you're like an 11 year old boy and your parents let you watchPG-13 movies. I can't think of anything positive to write about it.
2,Disappointed,"With Jason Stathom and Burt Reynolds I thought this movie might be entertaining, boy was I wrong. The dialoge sucked the makeup on the Krugs(orcs) was crappy and the acting was either over the top or like the were reading a prompter. The only good thing about this movie were the fight scenes and even they got just plane unbelievable. I'm not talking like ""theres no way he could have done that"" I'm saying that you could almost see the wires they used to keep them airborn.Stay far far away from this movie."
1,"Truly bad, but actually it grows on you","I originally posted that this was the worst dreck ever. In retrospect and having watched it again, it's actually not bad. Now I'd give it a 3 out of 5 stars for fun (but you can't change your star rating on here unfortunately). Good fun movie, just don't expect Oscar caliber."
3,Slightly disappointed,"Bravo Amanda, you sum up pretty much my own thoughts with a twist of humour. Mind you I gave it a higher score because I guess I enjoyed the movie a little bit more, although I was expecting more with such an impressive cast. Even though I was starting to be very disappointed in Jason Statham's movie roles lately, I truthfully loved him in this one.I agree that the Ninja dudes do not fit well in this type of movie, and quite frankly, I don't really know why they were even there.There were other flaws, but in conclusion, I believe it was entertaining and a slightly below-average fantasy movie."
4,Odd but it grows on you,At first this movie makes no sense. Jason aka Farmer has a London accent but was raised since he was three among folks that have an American accent. Once you get past that the movie is pretty good. Jason (as usual) takes on a very 'die-hard' style role of being the monster slayer but some things surprise you toward the end. Lots of battle in this but not really bloody so teens can watch as well.
5,Uwe boll directed this!,"don't get me wrong, i am not a Uwe boll hater but this film was far more blockbuster-ish than his other b-movie style films. i don't now what dungeon siege is but this movie rocked."
1,Not good,"Bad script, worse acting wasted my money on this movie. I have literally spent a couple of thousand $'s on show's and movie's from amazon thru my linked acct. with my TiVo(also bought from amazon) But this was a complete waste of money. And i LOVE Jason Stathom. Go figur'...???"
1,This movie is a Flop!,"The wardrobe and sets are very good. The acting is poor, and the cast of actors is Horrible! The sound quality is good, with great cinematography. However, this is NOT a movie that is good enough to buy. It’s best to RENT this movie. This movie gets real cheesy and attempts to copy Lord of the Rings mythical creatures. It’s not well executed and flops in the end."
1,"""I am your King!""","You're gonna need your ribs taped up after laughing so hard during this stinker of a movie. Matthew Lilliard's ""I am your King"" scene is so unentionally hillarious that I could not keep myself from laughing so hard. I ran the scene back 5 times and almost passed out from the enjoyment. This film is great for the whole gang to gather around and make MST3K remarks. Ron Perlman looks so, so tired, and Ray Liotta looks like he just stepped off the ""Wild Hogs"" set. LeeLee Sobieski looks great as always, but seriously, this sweetheart needs a better agent. Kristanna Lokken (whose naked butt in Terminator 3 was the only saving grace from that TURKEY) has next to nothing to do except swing aroung on a fake vine and look pretty.This is a great film to watch while waitng for your flu medication to kick in. What a side-splitter!!"
1,Waste of time,"Do not waste your time, lame movie B class budget and actors except for a few stars but movie is still missing a story and a plot"
4,In the Name of the King,"When this first came out I thought poor casting for the type roles and so I passed on it. Since I have seen it on TV at least three times since then I actually grew more fond of it each time. Although this is noThe Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Theatrical Editions + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray] it certainly has some entertainment value. I think it has aged well and considering there aren't that many of this genre that are great this deserves a second look. Perhaps since I grew up on low budget movies of this type I may be giving it more latitude, but I think most those that enjoy this kind of escapism won't be disappointed. If you enjoyed this, catchDungeons and Dragons- Wrath of the Dragon God (Widescreen Edition).CA Luster"
2,Bad casting at its worst,"Jason Stratham, Ron Perlman & Claire Forlani (gorgeous) & John Rhys Davies were awesome. Their fine acting skills saved this film from a 1-star review.However, the casting staff should be fired for ruining what could have been an entertaining, if shallow, fantasy film. Ray Liotta was ghastly and jarring in his screen-time (fine actor, lousy part). Burt Reynolds is sleepwalking and again miscast. Leelee Sobieski is blah. Matthew Lillard looks like he wants to giggle through the film. Ugh.Not totally horrible, thanks only to Stratham Perlman, Forlani & Rhys Davies."
1,Uwe Boll Does it again...,"Even with a star-studded cast Uwe Boll managed yet again (see Blood Rayne et. al.) to create an embarrassment of a film. I am convinced that Uwe could not create even a decent film with Ridley Scott sitting on one shoulder and Steven Spielberg on the other. Why actors would ever want to work with him is a mystery beyond mysteries to me as his story lines are week, cinementography awful and direction pathetic. Unfortunately, with all the stars in the film, I did not notice that he was the director or I would have never wasted the rental fee. Uwe, please do all of us a favor and move to Montana, live in a shack with no power and never put out another movie again. I think I will have to get a retinal transplant after watching this."
2,"""I'm Changing The Structures Of The World?""","The one nagging thought that continually comes to mind while watching this film is the `Lord of the Rings' and how blatantly evident and extensive the plagiarism is from that seminal work. So much so that providing a list of camparisons between the two would be tedious and boring.With that said, there's no need whatsoever to provide a synopsis of the '08 film `In the Name of the King', just change a few key names and you have all you need to know. Substitute Jason Statham (Farmer) for Viggo Mortensen (Strider), John Rys-Davies (Merick) for Ian McKellen (Gandalf) and an army of Krugs instead of Orcs and you're good to go. Just don't be too disappointed about the absence of hobbits.Not to be totally negative, I always enjoy the presence of Ron Perlman and Claire Forlani and Kristanna Loken serve as rather pleasant diversions to an otherwise cumbersome film.P.S.: I'm still trying to figure out where the ninjas fit in?"
3,Why is This So Hated,"Seriously, it was not a bad movie, aside from some of the acting, and a misplaced villain as Ray Liotta. But when movies like Knight and Day and Eragon are getting 4 to 5 stars as an overall rating, I have to wonder. It just goes to show that reviews can be biased, depending on the audience.Not saying this movie was great, but these days you have to lower your expectations due to the drivel that gets shoved out, although with the above examples I mentioned, perhaps some people are lowering there expectations too often for the wrong things."
3,In the Name of the King - A Dungeon Siege Tale,"This movie had great actors in it, the story was a little rushed but exciting none the less. If you can see it for free and have an hour to kill, go nuts; but dont go out of your way to watch."
1,Not even Jason can save it,"I thought ""Yeah, it's probably not the best, but I love Jason so how bad can it be?"" Oh my, I found myself getting up & doing chores around the house for most of it. It was awful. The acting is terrible, the fight scenes are laughable and Ray Liotta was terrible. The person who reviewed it with a poem hit the nail on the head. Don't waste your money - even if you really like Jason!!!"
2,:0( WHAT THE !!!!!,"I love JASON STATHAM but seriously....1. why is Ray Liotta in a leather pants and jacket with a button up shirt really now.............2.and fighting ninjas ok then...3. And this Joan of arch wanna be pleaseeeeeeeee...It was so so so soooooooooooooooooooooooo corny, can't believe i got this on dvd.but he does look gooooooooooooooooooood"
1,Can I get a refund????,"This will be short and to the point unlike this movie .This movie sucked I cant believe so many good actors did such a terable job. The whole story line seemed rushed like this thing was haphazaerdly slaped togather in as speedy a fashion as possable . I felt cheated .., watch at your own risk."
1,WHY?,Who ever gives Uwe Boll money to fund his films please stop. This man's films are down right horrible and I can't beleive some of these popular actors keep acting in his films. Please for the love of God stop this man from making any more movies.
1,Uwe Boll failfest,"All I really want to know is, who keeps letting Uwe Boll make movies? I watched Bloodrayne, and he made that seem like Hamlet compared to this latest stinker.I would say just avoid anything that ever has this director attached to it. Somehow he managed to get a few big name actors involved with this one so that more unsuspecting people would be tricked into watching it."
1,Dont buy it unless you just want a laugh,"This movie is horribly bad from every aspect of movie making. Some of the actors are no good, there is no background into anyone and then when you finally get to the end, you find the movie does not have an ending, it just stops. You are left wondering what happened to half the people. The extended edition may help this but I am doubting it. The script jumps all over, the film making is bad (the colors change totally from one shot to the next, some shots are grainy or fuzzy like shot with a home video camera), the bad guy in the movie is not believable because he looks like Wayne Newton. The movie goes on forever but some parts seem rushed, I could keep going on..."
1,It stinks.,"After watching this film I felt compelled to let people know how bad it is. I mean I LOVE bad Sci Fi films but this one was unwatchable (I found myself fast forwarding through the action scenes it was so bad).Great B star cast but the writing, special effects, plot, the fact there were 4 different accents with ""related"" characters...did I mention there was almost no motivation for the whole movie or explanation of so much?And when that all wasn't stinking, the acting did. The action was so weak - fake sword swings worse than a 2 your old could do...All in all this movie stinks and it stinks bad. If I could find my way to the producer and slap them in the face I would.""You sir make offensive films!"""
1,"Spare yourself, dont rent or buy","Im not a movie critic, and Im fairly easy to please. And I have to say that this movie was aweful. It was a tragic rip-off of Lord of the Rings....devoid of all creativity. I want those precious minutes of my life back."
1,"Sorry Jason, don't waste your time.","How do I even begin? I love Jason Statham. I think everything he touches is gold, this movie being the one exception. I was so excited to see he was in another film, and of a slightly different genre. This movie was lacking something, in a major way. The screen play was laughable, it sounded like lines my six year would make up.It's bad... really bad. Don't even rent it, you'll be sorry you did."
1,Shockingly bad,"This movie was actually recommended to me by a friend so I made an effort to like it. Although I have generally liked all of Jason Stratham's movies (I thought even Chaos was decent) I could not get through more than 15 minutes of this. It was incredibly boring and poorly written. The dialogue and the acting were actually irritating to watch. The action scenes were horrendous; the monsters would not even work in a B movie. This movie was so bad I have lost respect for my friend for recommending it. Besides losing a friend, I also lost 15 minutes of my life that I will never get back. If you like Jason Stratham check out Revolver and Crank instead."
3,Another dungeons and dragons movie,"Jason Stratham (better known for his ""Transporter"" movies), delivers a fairy tale, good vs. evil fantasy / adventure to the screen. In spite of the great supporting actors such as LeeLee Sobieski and Ray Liota, this film is boring. LeeLee Sobieski dressed in armor is just another reincarnation of her Joan of Ark performance.It is a good entertainemnt value movie if you are looking for manly fist and sword fights, magic tricks and stories of honor. Safe enough for children."
2,Very disappointed!,"This is a very disappointing movie, and obviously very badly researched. The dialogue just does not fit the era. The movie is about characters of the 21st century placed during the middle ages. For example, an order to `fire' the arrows is given. Did you `fire' arrows at that era? You fire guns, but not arrows. The script is really very badly written, and the acting just as bad. The transition between scenes is also amateurish. This movie was a waste of really good talent."
1,Can't even describe it!!,"This was by far, the worst movie I've seen in a long time.I really like Jason Statham and in this movie he does what he does, as well as Ron Pearlman... but that's it!! Everything else is terrible.The dialogues are incredibly bad, the make-up is worse, the acting of everyone surrounding Jason and Ron is a joke!Really, I could go on and on about how bad this movie was, but I have a headache as I just finished watching it. Do yourself a favor and NEVER watch this movie."
1,Horrid.,"This movie is terrible. If you have nothing else to do (I mean nothing else at all), give it a watch - it's worth a few laughs, if nothing else."

5,I've finally found the Marley show I was looking for!,"First, let me say that I'm an avid Bob Marley fan. I own every Island release and some other bootleg releases. I have both the Live! VHS and the Heartland Reggae DVD and neither does justice to Marley's career then this DVD. Sure, the picture quality may not be that sharp at time, and Bob's energy seems to be waning(this was a year before he passed away), the show and the vibe felt from the Wailers and the crowd is explosive. I have been looking for this DVD since I saw the Laser Disc version of this concert. People, if there is any Marley to get on DVD, along with the newly released ""Legend"", this is the one to get."
3,Next best live footage to Live At The Rainbow IMO,"BUT, this is a must have for any Bob fan. My only complaint is that the video mastering could have been better, but it is in widescreen 16x9 and in 5.1 Dolby Digital......great enhancements.My Live @ The Rainbow VHS's video quality is better than this show, but I guess they did their best. So bring out the L@TR on DVD in widescreen and 5.1......and it will be a great collection of Bob's best live footage available."
2,"Great music, HORRIBLE OUT OF FOCUS VIDEO","I'm an old Deadhead so I had Bob's show from the soundboard at the Santa Barbara Bowl on cassette and then CDR years and years ago. I always wondered what the show looked like, since there's not much high-quality live Marley floating around. Boy, was I disappointed!This video must have been shot by some folks who had too much ""smoke"" and couldn't tell if their cameras were in focus or not. The entire video, from beginning to end, is fuzzy and out-of-focus. I kept hoping the video quality would improve at some point, but it never did. I was kind of thinking, ""Man, I wish I could reach out and tweak the focus on this."" You can see everything just fine, it's just out of focus.The audio quality is superb, so this is something I'll play when I'm riding my exercise bike at home and want some good music and don't really care that the audio quality is HORRIBLE.Dem music quality very good. Dem video quality be very bad, mon, bad, bad, bad."
5,FANTASTIC,"This DVD is the best archive from Bob Marley history!Really AMAZING...i dont't have words to describe itif you have some doubt to buy, dont't think twice! Buy Now!!!BestAndreBrazil - Rastafari"
3,"Great show, Bad Video quality","This is probably one of the greatest video capture of Bob Marley. I have a laserdisc copy that completely blows away the DVD in terms of video quality. Its full screen, super sharp resolution and almost feels like you are there. I am wondering what happened during the duping/ mastering process for the DVD release. Someone did a terrible injustice to such great content."
4,Suspenseful and poignant,"Ellie Hathaway is an attorney living in the city with her boy friend of eight years whose ambitions override decency and justice and threatens to harden Ellie's heart until the stains of moral corruption will no longer haunt her as she climbs to the top of her profession. After one particularly difficult trial in which she argues the case of a man she knows is guilty of child molestation and sets him free, she seeks solace in Paradise, Pennsylvania where she spent many happy summers as a child. Paradise is a small town where the Old Order Amish live and work, where horse-drawn buggies compete with automobile traffic, and where life is generally slower-paced. Here Ellie becomes involved in representing Katie Fisher an unmarried Amish girl, accused of murdering her newborn. Can Ellie find the clues to the secrets of this Amish family, or is the girl guilty as charged? Eunice Boeve, author of Ride a Shadowed Trail"
4,What the????,"Hi everyone, don't know what's going on, but less than a month ago I paid$8.63 for the book on my Kindle and now it's nearly $20.Sorry not really a review, good book if it matters."
4,"Good book, typical Picoult style","I was excited to see this book on sale for Kindle as Jodi Picoult books are usually never priced less than $12.99, which is spendy in my opinion. This was a great book, I loved the perspective of both Katie and Ellie. Ellies perspective allowed you to get a feel for the differences between the Amish and the English and to see and feel the difference from an English perspective. Katie's perspective added to that by show casing the differences she witnessed being Amish and learning more about the English lifestyle. The story is written in true Picoult style, someone goes to trial and gets acquitted for some random reason. It was easy to figure out who killed the baby but I still enjoyed the ending and of course all of the trials and tribulations of each character along the way."
5,Plain Truth,Just a wonderful read. Amish lifestyle throughout the book I just loved. More twists in this book than I originally thought and just loved that it kept my attention. Couldn't put it down.
3,Good,"I love Jodi Picoult novels. She does a great research and her characters always deliver. On the sour note: this book had some elements of a lifetime movie qulity, which I don't love and if you read many of her novels, they always proceed in the same manner. I liked it, but not the best one"
2,Plain Truth falls flat,"I started Plain Truth with high hopes, but the more I read, the more disappointed I became. The characters start out one-dimensional, and remain that way. The plot ""twists"" are predictable. I am suspicious of Picoult's research abilities- for example, she has a major character take the train to State College, which is not served by a passenger line. Readers should wonder if her characterizations of Amish life are similarly inaccurate."
1,so bad i'm giving up and returning it 1/2 read,"my first picoult book was my sisters keeper, i loved it and immediately wanted to buy all of picoults books. i happened to get this one next and it's one of the worst books i have ever read. yet, i've kept with it, reading more than 1/2 and it's so bad and boring and unbelievable that i've put it down for the last time and plan to return it tomorrow. i've never returned a partially read book, but i don't want to support such junk. really disappointed."
2,"To Tell The Truth, It's Pretty Plain","This novel had an interesting premise: dead baby found on Amish farm. Amish girl denies birth despite physical evidence indicating pregnancy. Big-city lawyer comes to defend Amish girl in her murder trial and ends up learning a lot about herself and dealing with her past. And of course, it's Jodi Picoult, which automatically means it'll be a compelling read. And it was. But mainly because delving into the character of Katie Fisher (which means delving into what it's like to be Amish) was fascinating. As far as the actual murder mystery storyline goes, everything was utterly predictable. I knew as soon as the baby was found exactly what had happened and spent the entire book waiting for everyone else to catch on. And Ellie's (a.k.a. big-city lawyer) transformations and realizations were something I'd seen before a million times and to make it worse, there didn't seem to be any real reasons for her to be the way she was. Two stars only because I like the Amish."
5,Great Page-Turner - Couldn't Put it Down!!!,Another great book by Jodi Picoult. I love reading about the Amish culture and the court case had me on the edge of my seat. Great characterisations throughout. Definitely worth reading!!
4,Plain Truth,This was interesting and engaging. The story was somewhat unique and thought provoking. I would recommend it to all of my friends.
5,Great book!,"Prompt delivery, wonderful book by a great author. If you haven't read anything by Jodi Picoult, pick one up."
3,I shouldn't be reviewing this yet....,"because I haven't finished it but I feel compelled to say something about what I've read so far. When I bought this book, I couldn't wait to get home and dive in. It begins great, it's very intriguing. It is an interesting plot with characters that I want to learn more about but I must say that about halfway through I got bored with the way in which the story was being told. It just really started to drag. I found myself skipping first paragraphs then skimming entire pages.I will finish it, I just had to take a break. The sagging in the middle was sort of getting to me...."
2,Okay at first...,The story started off interestingly enough and then became progressively boring and trite. The ending was a complete surprise and a ridiculous disappointment. I would not recommend this book at all.
2,Plain is right!,"Jodi Picoult is a wonderful story teller. (Keeping Faith was amazing!!!) In my opinion she should have kept this tale, Plain Truth, for a collection of short stories. This book was so reduntant, that I would frequently doze off after only a few pages. If I read ""I didn't have a baby"" one more time I thought I would scream!"
4,A definite MUST READ!,"After having read ""The Pact"" and ""Keeping Faith"", I could not wait to beging ""Plain Truth"" and, let me tell you, it was completed in no more than 2 days! Set in an Amish community, Picoult captures Amish life with much accuracy and detail and the court-room drama kept my fingers itching to continue to turn the pages of this incredible novel. This page turning book succeeds in keeping the reader engrossed, as the life and secrets of Katie unravel. When the reader thinks all secrets are revealed, think again!!!!"
4,Excellently written!,"This is the first book I have read by Jodi Picoult, and I can't wait to read another book by this author! She is a very talented writer, and this book was an absolute page-turner for me. The plot was very interesting, and the story really flowed well. I would definitely recommend this book!"
1,Not what you claimed,"You said this copy was in ""very good"" condition. It had torn pages, water ripples and pages were discolored. There are also perhaps food stains. Gross. Far from ""very good"". The binding was well intact but still not a fair assessment of the condition."
2,Incomplete Ending!,"******SPOILER WARNING*******I just finished listening to this audio book last night and felt really disappointed by the ending. Why doesn't the author tell us what happens with Katie? Does she end up w/ Adam or Samuel? How about Ellie and Coup? Does her baby make it to full term, do they get married? And Katie's Mom's parting gift and short confession....what's up with that?? She's the one who needs to see a shrink and YES she should go to trial and be found guilty. If you murder someone, even if they have a life threatening disease, it's still murder! Did she find the baby already dead in Katie's arms, or did she really kill him herself? Overall the book was a little slow for me and I guess I enjoy books that give you a complete ending.Get this book from the library IF you just HAVE to read it."
5,Plain Truth,Another outstanding book by Jodi Picoult. This is a thougtful and interesting insight into the minds and ways of Amish people. The comparison between Amish values and those of many other people makes the reader think twice about his or her own values.
5,Amazing!,"I read a lot of Jodi Picoult. If you are a Picoult fan, you know that sometimes you need to read another author in between and then go back to Jodi. I have read most of her books and this is clearly one of her best! I loved it. It is right up there with Sister's Keeper!"
5,I can't say enough good things about this book!,"Hands down this is the best book I have read this year. Its possibly one of the best books I have read EVER! The story was aboslutely wonderful. The depcitions of the Amish way of life alone would have made this a great read, but Ms. Picoult went further than that. The research that had to be done into Amish life, legal process and medical proceedures had to have been extensive, and the results are a a beautiful book. She has portrayed a segment of American people many of us know little or nothing about in a very dignified way. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the Amish. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys courtroom fiction. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys love stories. In short, I would recommed this book to anyone who is looking for a stellar read."
4,Riveting story...entertaining and a learning experience,"I have read 2 of Jodi's books...Plain Truth and Sing You Home...she not only tells a riveting story that keeps you interesed, but also teaches about people, experiences and cultures that we may not be aware of. I am a voracious reader who primarily enjoys classical books that were written between the 1850's and 1950's...along with Bragg and Conroy, Picoult is one of the few authors today who can command my interest. With most authors now, if you read one, you've read them all...same plots, same kind of characters and same stories...without the ability to learn about others."
4,You just wonder how it's going to end.,Keeps you on your toes. Can't put it down. Keeps you engrossed page after page. Jodi is a good story writer.
5,"Nothing ""Plain"" About This Novel","I am a tremendous fan of Jodi Picoult's. She is the queen of the surprise ending. I am amazed everytime I finish one of her novels by the way I feel about the characters she created. Her writing style is warm and familiar, like a favorite blanket. I found the plot to be fascinating and could not put this novel down. I highly recommend it!"
4,great,"i would recommend this book for anyone. as always jodi picoult always ends up in the court room,and sometimes that could drag on for a little while too long...the ending was amazing. so many twist. it was a great book. and she is a great author"
2,I expected better,"I've enjoyed most of the books by this author (My Sisters Keeper is a favorite and also Nineteen minutes), but I didnt care for this book. The conclusion felt hurried and left me dissatisfied. I also felt zero sympathy for the Amish girl, Katie, because her persona came off wooden and ignorant. I also didnt understand the secondary story about the sister's ghost. Nothing really came of it at the end so it was almost irritating that the story line existed. This book was not worth 12 dollars."
4,Different and entertaining!,"I am reading Plain Truth now, and I am very impressed. At times I get bored with Picoult because many of her books are the same, but this is different. I had trouble putting it down. Decide for yourself."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"Very well-written story about Ellie, a defense attorney who is helping a young Amish girl accused of murder. I couldn't put it down!"
3,feels like a young adult novel,"After reading two other Jodi Picoult novels, I was pretty disappointed with this. It was simplistic and predictable, and felt as it had been written for 14 year-old readers. The main character is supposed to be a sharp and successful lawyer, and I was frustrated with how foolish and slow she could be at times. The emotional manipulation was so obvious that is was painful at other times. Yet the story was somewhat interesting, and I kept at it until the end. While I enjoyed it to some degree, I feel almost embarrassed to admit that. The fact is, Jodi Picoult is much better when writing about people and surroundings from her modern world. She can make believable stories and characters, but didn't this time. The Amish world was interesting, but I feel more like someone told me about it rather than having lived in it, as I should do is a better novel. This barely earned three stars from me."
4,The Amish disagree,"In answer to one review of the book and one review of the VHS, who said they didn't portray Amish life and Amish beliefs accurately, the author, in an interview, said the Amish people she knows who have read the book say it portrays their lifestyle and beliefs 100% accurately."
2,Beach book candidate,"Having not read Jodi Picoult's other novels, I can't compare PLAIN TRUTH to her earlier work, which has been favorably reviewed. I did consider PLAIN TRUTH a disappointment. Primarily a mystery, which unravels itself long before the supposed dramatic revelation. Characters stereotypes. Self discovery dilemmas cliched. Writing style unremarkable.The Amish setting is an interesting device to juxtapose value systems and to force critical evaluation of one's own definition of the ""truth"". Unfortunately, the narrative follows a predictable course once all the characters have been defined."
5,"There's nothing ""Plain"" about this story!!","Plain Truth has it all - mystery, suspense, romance, love, heartbreak, forgiveness. What a talented writer!!Picoult takes you away to another place and culture. Explains it to you, and makes you want to go there and see it for yourself.There was a part in the book that touched my soul. It made me recall a painful and difficult time in my life, however, it also helped me to remember again that there are times, when tough things happen for a reason.Ms. Picoult did not hesitate to respond to my email when I wrote to thank her for sharing her thoughts and feelings through her writing. I highly recommend Plain Truth, and encourage you to read her other works."
3,A Reminder Of What Wonders Books Can Be,"Plain Truth has become one of my favorite books. It clicked for me like Cold Sassy Tree and a few others. The right book at the right time is a wonder. I've always been intrigued by the Amish, and moral dilemmas are another draw for me. These elements combined with wonderful characters, a clash of cultures, perfect pacing, drama, and suspense produced for me a book that became totally absorbing. The plot and characters grabbed me on the first page, haunted my waking hours, and haven't released me yet. My heart still aches for Katie. Images of the ethereal skater glide through my thoughts. I marvel at what love can do in lives. This is one of those books that will find a permanent place on my nightstand, a comfort and reminder of what books can do and be."
3,"very entertaining, but....","This book is a real page turner and very entertaining. However, the dialog is corny, the situation contrived, and the view of the Amish not quite believable. Even though the sophisticated side of me says, ""this is nothing but a glorified romance novel"", my romantic side is eating it up!"
4,Pleased Jodi Picoult fan,"I really enjoyed this one from Ms. Picoult. I'm a fan of hers and have been catching up reading all her older books. The first I ever read was My Sister's Keeper and I loved it and kind of use that to compare to all her other books. Plain Truth, I thought, was great. This story of a baby's supposed murder in the Amish community is told from different vantage points throughout the book, as most of her books are. I am fascinated by the Amish and was looking forward to learning a little more, so I liked seeing into their world through an outsider and insider point of view. I think the way she tied the characters together was nicely done. I could barely put the book down, trying to piece together Katie's case. While I thought the ending was a little obvious, it turned out I had the wrong person pegged. Maybe the ending would be clear to others, but the book would still be a great read."
4,"Enjoyable, Jodi Picoulet",I have read most Jodi Picoulet books and always enjoy them. This book was no exception. I also enjoyed learning so much about the Amish people.
2,"Great Potential, but ultimately disappointing","This is a reasonably entertaining book, but unfortunately it is factually inaccurate and sadly anticlimactic. The research of both the amish lifestyle and central PA setting was obviously not as thorough as it could have been. The storyline was quite interesting, but the characters were a flat and the action a little slow. From the first few pages, I had great expectations for the book, but after finishing it, I have to say it is not a great book."
5,Nothing better!,"""Plain Truth"" was the first Jodi Picoult book that I read. I've always loved reading books about the Amish. Something about them attracks me, maybe its that deep down I've wanted to experience their life style. So a friend gave me this book for my birthday and I absolutely fell in love with it. Each of Jodi's books run so smoothly - it is not a bumpy ride! I found myself staying up til 1 or 2 in the morning saying I would finish this chapter and then go to bed, but then needing to read the next chapter! You can't put it down! I loved ""Plain Truth"" but I can't say that its my favorite, although its up there (wait- they are all up there!). I've read all of her books, except for Songs of the Humpback Whale which I am in the middle of reading now and they were all equally terriffic. If you've read Plain Truth, don't stop there! You have to read all of her books!!!!! I recommend every single one of them. I cannot wait until her next book, Second Glance, is released in April."
4,A Unique Mystery,"This was my first Jodi Picoult but having had her books recommended to me by so many fellow readers, I felt I needed to give her a try. I was not disappointed.Plain Truth is a very well-written story about the mystery surrounding the birth and almost immediate death of a baby in the barn of an Amish farm. It is a fascinating story as the reader accompanies the Philadelphia lawyer chosen to defend the young mother accused of killing her own baby.It is a fascinating story, well-researched and, in my opinion, fairly and honestly written in terms of comparing the lives of the ""plain"" Amish to those in the outside world. It is, perhaps, a fraction too long but well worth the read to discover the ultimate truth to the mystery."
1,A Disappointing Book,"For a high-powered big-city lawyer, Ellie was too stupid to ask the obvious questions during her investigation. The situation where she had to live with the Fisher family was contrived. And why is it that to make a story more ""interesting,"" the lawyer must become personally involved with friends or family, including sleeping with witnesses? After all, Perry Mason did a fantastic job as a lawyer, and he defended total strangers and never behaved improperly with any of them. This book is more of a Harlequin romance than a mystery."
1,"Poor research, flat characters, uncompelling plot","I agree with the reviewer from State College that this book is poorly researched, and with those who found the characters flat and the plot uncompelling. It is highly doubtful that an old-order Amish girl would be permitted to travel alone to a college town once a month, to visit her brother who had left the Amish community. There is no train service to State College, PA anyway. Are we to actually believe that Katie reinquished her strict religious beliefs that forbid zippers and buttons so that she can put on jeans and a shirt, and ride a ski lift while visiting her brother on those weekend getaways? Are paranormal phenomena really discerned with a divining rod? (That was the breaking point for me - a whole new twist on the Dowser's Society!) I have not yet finished the book and will probably skim most of the 2nd half....if I bother at all."
4,it was so-so,"I'm going to be quite honest, don't be mad it's just my opinion. bad news first: the book was sometimes, annoyingly slow, I didn't enjoy it, i could put it down at any time, and had to force myself to finish it, and i wasn't excited when i was done.But however one gets such an indepth look at the amish lifestyle, it breaks so much stereotypes, and you understand them so much more. That part was very well done, and i loved it. However it's possible that you might enjoy the book more. Plus at the end, there's an interview which answers a lot of question you might want to know."
3,page turner..but not the best,this is the first book ive read by picoult...its a page turner for sure but a lot of the parts in the book were boring and slow...i give her credit because she does a wonderful job of describing the life of the amish people. the reason why it is such a page turner is beacuse we find out little by little about katies past and the ending is a real surprise
2,"This book is going in my ""garage sale"" pile.","I will not be passing it on to a friend. The ending left me irritated; why should I close a book with questions in my head? I will not buy another Picoult book. I felt ""snookered"" by Keeping Faith and now I have been fooled twice.I have to say I did enjoy the book up until the ending, but the Hannah ghost plot was unfulfilled and I was surprised to find out in the middle of the book that Ellie had short hair. Why didn't I know that before? Obviously, the characters would have benefited from better descriptions."
1,Plain Dreary Amish Book,"Having settled myself on a long flight with this book, I had hoped for an engrossing look into the Amish culture. Wrong! This book proved long, very long. It also was depressing and dull. I have read Beverly Lewis several books with Amish settings and all have been delightful. But this book by Jodi Picolet was uncompromisingly critical of the Amish culture and although billed as a mystery, there was no mystery to be had. One can only wonder if the author was at all familiar with the Amish people. I was left with the uncomfortable feeling that she didn't like nor understand the Amish. The book went on and on, but did not ever catch the ambiance of its locale. Having lived in Lancaster County for some years, I can assure you the book doesn't ring true. I was disappointed I wasted my money and time. Dorothy King"
3,Drawn out plot but a good read anyway.,"This story started out really good then came to a screeching halt in the middle. One of the characters in the story is a lawyer and the whole middle of the book deals with the court case in minute deatil of what you had already read in the first half of the book. VERY tedious. The story itself was very good, just skip the middle."
2,Plain Truth,"This book started out really good. Then the author repeats and repeats and repeats. I found myself scanning most all of the pages just to get to the end. When I got to the end, I hated it. Too many pages of repeats, made me lose interest in the book."
1,Not believable.,"I found the whole thing of Katie escaping to her brother and being someone else, doing worldly things and dressing in worldly clothes and then coming home and being content to be Amish, so silly and unbelievable. When Ellie asked why she didn't want to cut her hair, she said, ""Because why would I want to be different from everybody else?""A very silly book all the way through. I agree that the prose is just so sappy, as well.""There was sorrow in his gaze that made Katie think anquish had risen in him like a sea, leaving a watermark that cut right across the blue of his eyes.""Groan. And that's just one example.This may seem a little thing but one of my first red flags was Ellie naming the flowers on page 58. Ellie Hathaway, a high-powered Philadelphia defense attorney....AKA--Nature Lover?? I have lived in the country all my life and I'd have a hard time identifying wildflowers. Maybe Piccoult explained how Ellie had this knowledge but I missed it."
3,"Read one Picoult, read them all","This is the 3rd Jodi Picoult novel I've read, the first two being Nineteen Minutes and My Sister's Keeper. I can't say I didn't enjoy reading it - she writes well and keeps the reader engrossed with the story lines. But after only 3 of her novels, I was ready for the ""surprise"" ending that all her novels seem to come with and so the book held no real intensity for me. Enjoyable, yes, but very formulaic."
2,Tedious read,"This could have been a really great short story. As a full book, it has tedious character development that goes on and on and on. Over and over and over. I was irritated that I spent the time on it. The ending is an unnecessary letdown."
3,"Some insight into Amish values, but...","The main thrust of this book is about the clash of cultures and beliefs which come about when an Amish girl goes to trial in a US for the murder of her newborn baby.As another reader noted, however, my enjoyment of the book was somewhat ruined by Picoult's insistence on twisting all loose ends neatly into a happy ending."
4,the truth is you'll like this book!,"When I finished this book, I said outloud WOW! It is another great read by Picoult and while I didn't give it 5 stars, it is very good but there were some points which I felt overdone and I did have a few questions I wish had been fulfilled.That said however, the writer brings the Amish life ""to life"" for the reader and you feel like you are on that farm - in that barn where the dead newborn is found - and questioning Katie, the alleged mother of the baby.A mystery and a walk through the faith of a people different than ""the outside world""."
3,Riddled with factual errors,"I was disappointed with this offering by Jodi Picoult. I had hoped to learn something more about the Amish, but instead was distracted by numerous factual errors about the setting that made me doubt everything else she wrote. For instance, she writes about taking a train to State College, PA, when there is no passenger train service to that area; she has court officials us the term ""state of Pennsylvania"", when it is the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; she has a weak understanding of criminal law and court procedure; she talks about an Amish girl's surprise at seeing her brother's shaven face when only married Amish men wear beards. These errors could easily have been eliminated with just a little bit of research. The lack of research on these small details took me out of the story, and made me less willing to trust other details she presents. The rest of the book is okay at best. Character development is weak, and plot is predictable. I'd pass on this one."
1,What a dumb book,"This is the worst book I have read in YEARS!!!!!!!!! I sure wish I could get my money back on this .... If you have not read this ... yet and I sure hope that you have not, do yourself a favor and save your money and time. This book is a joke."
1,Horrible,"I had to finish it in one weekend so as not to prolong the agony any longer than necessary. I couldn't put it down because I was forced to read it by my book club. I would rather burn my copy than pass it on to someone else. It was horribly boring, I didn't care about any of the characters, her writing is elementary best, and the plot all seemed blantantly obvious to me. I will never read another Picoult book if my life depends on it."
2,repititousrepititous,"The story is fine and the characters are decently drawn. However, from half way on one gets the feeling Ms. Picoult was being paid by the word. Sherepeats thematic elements and information already received by the reader over and over. And on and on. End already!!!I will say there was interesting insight into the Amish community and an initially interesting mystery. I cannot recommend this read."
3,Not her best,"I was disappointed with this J Piccoult book, tho it was one of her earlier ones. The story rambled, was unrealistic and the ending was predictable, unlike her usual endings with a twist. Usually I can't put her books down, but with this one it took a little effort to finish it. Still not a bad read, just not her best."
2,Disappointed,"I'm afraid that I found this book not nearly as good as it could have been. The characters are insufficently filled in, and the storyline just doesn't work for me. There are numerous inconsistencies throughout the book (one example; they make a point of saying there *are* no closets in the bedrooms, then the size 7 shoes magically appear in ""Katie's closet""). I never really understood why the Lizzie character was in the story, except as a sort of contrast to Ellie, and I found their snipping at each other totally unrealistic. And if I read one more time that Katie's hands were ""small and calloused"" I was going to scream;) I live about an hour away from Lancaster and have visited the area several times. The author's portrayal of their lifestyle today may be fairly accurate, but I found her numerous pop-culture references gratuitous."
3,Interesting story filled with stereotypes,"This is the second Picoult book I've read (the first being Vanishing Acts, which was NOT good, in my opinion).I can't help but feel that I'm trapped in a Lifetime movie when I read Picoult novels because one, her dialogue is ALWAYS cheesy, and never insightful or meaningful. And two, the stories are always intriguing and compelling, but are predictable and the characters are very stereotypical. You always have the bold, successful lawyer who has recently come under self-doubt or self-discovery ... or something. The crime, which Picoult usually manages to ruin at the very end with the otherwise ""quiet"" and ""demure"" character doing something ""surprising."" It's just all too formulaic for me. I always expect more depth and less song-and-dance, and I never get that from this writer.That being said Plain Truth really is a good story. The twists and turns tend to be a bit much at times, but it's entertaining, I guess. Just like a corny Lifetime movie."
3,Just OK,"I couldn't wait to finish the book so that I could start something else. I found the characters flat and predicted the ending early in the book. Through out the middle of the book I felt like I was rereading the same paragraph over and over.On the plus side, I appreciate that the Author actually went to live with Amish people to research the book. She was very astute about the Amish practice of forgiveness. I lived in Harrisburg PA area for 15 years and have seen Amish folk many times, but did not know about their forgiving nature until the horrible school house incident. This book was written prior to that incident and the author should be commended for having portrayed the Amish so accurately."
1,Agonizingly S-l-o-w-w-w,"I am reading this for a book club and dread picking it up every night. I'm on page 110 and still know just as much as I knew on page one. The action--such as it is--is interrupted constantly by five-page italicized ""rememberings"" that took place in the past.The ""descriptive"" writing style is maddening, like something from a silly writer's workshop. Nobody in this book ""drinks a glass of lemonade."" Noo, that would be too quick, and the book would only be 200 pages then. In this book (I'm making this up,) they would ...""walk into the kitchen, still and quiet and uneartly slow in the morning half-light, untouched yet by the activity of the household. They grasp the silvery handle of the icebox, smooth and cool and soothing, somehow, to the palm reddened by life in the barns and hollows of the Amish land they all knew and loved. Inside the icebox is the crystal bottle of lemonade, gleaming, yet tart...""AAIAEEEIII! Enough! Just pour the da*n lemonade and let me turn the page!"
3,a real page turner with an unneeded twist,This is the second book I have read by this author and as with the first book I could not put it down. The unusual setting made what could have been a run-of-the-mill courtroom story more interesting. I had previosly read My Sisters Keeper and had felt that the twist at the end of that book did nothing for that book. That was the case with this book as well. The twist at the end did nothing to tie up the story and in my opinion cheapened and made unbelievable the whole story.
2,Too Plain for Me,"I checked out the reader reviews of this book before I bought it, so I was aware that it had been rated ""the best"" and ""the worst."" Some readers thought it was worth one star, some gave it five. Now that I've finished it, I'm completely baffled by the five-star reviews. I guess it wasn't the worst book I've ever read, but it was utterly simplistic and maddeningly repetitive. I thought we would NEVER get to that trial. And the ending! I began to suspect about two-thirds of the way through the book that the author might do what she ultimately did on the last couple of pages, and I thought, ""Oh, please. Not that."" But--sure enough. Jodi, Jodi, Jodi! I wouldn't say, ""Don't read this book."" But I would advise prospective readers to borrow it from someone, rather than laying out $... for the paperback. I bought it for only $..., and I still feel cheated."
2,Plain Truth,"An interesting enough read. The plot had a few twists and turns, reading about the Amish was good, but the story did seen to drag on and on."
3,not my favorite JP book,"I loved Nineteen Minutes, The Pact and The Perfect Match. I randomly stock up on Jodi Picoult's books when I find a good deal online - I find them a departure from the relaxing (check your brain at the door) books I usually read as they're substantial, suspensful and very well written. Plain Truth, however, was not as good as the others I enjoyed so much. I found the ending predictable and the reaction of the main character really not believable. The writing was great, the plot had potential but over all, I was left wanting more and wishing for a different outcome."
2,major fan?,ive read so many of jodis books. but with this one i found myself gazing off and not even able to find an interest in this book... i also had to drag my self through the book waiting for somethuing to happen... love ya jodi but. not the best book ever... :(
3,Fair overall,"I've been on a recent kick reading a variety of Amish-inspired books. Overall, this was a fair attempt. It was my first time reading Jodi Picoult, but it did not turn me into one of her rabid fans. There were several inconsistencies with characters (how they were portrayed through the majority of the book and then an action they took for sake of the plot that was not in sync with their portrayal) as well as with Amish in general (from my personal knowledge living near them for some time before moving back to SC, as well as through my reading). These things made me snap out of that ""suspension of disbelief"" to crucial to thoroughly enjoying a book.I will probably try another novel by her at some point. However, I really don't see (through this book) how she has created the fan base she has."
1,Don't bother,"The details about life in the Amish culture are interesting. I grew up near a very large Amish community, so I can vouch for the accuracy in many of the details. However, I was very unhappy with the how clearly the ending was telegraphed. Without spoiling for anyone, it becomes painfully obvious what the twist will be very early in the story. I actually found it insulting that the author could pretend like a reader would not notice an obvious person being ignored in the course of the investigation and several conversations about what could or could not have happened. I felt like my intelligence was being insulted. This is my last time reading a Picoult book. One star given for the Amish details, -stars for plot development."
2,Book club selection,"This book is great if you want to learn all about the Amish lifestyle and culture. Way too much repeated information, the book should be half as long for the content, but the ending had a great twist."
4,A good read,"This is the first book by Jodi Picoult that I've read. I plan to read more. I found it to be a very good read, a real page turner. The ending was pretty much predictable by the time I got to it, but all in all it was a good book. It's an easy read and you'll learn something about the Amish way of life."
1,Skip to the End!,"As much as I love this author, I hated this book. The first few chapters set the story, and the last couple chapters end it. And nothing else happens in the middle. It's chapter after chapter of repetitive denials of what we all learn happens on the first page. If you insist on reading this book, read the first couple chapters- then skip to the end!"
2,The Plain Truth,"I cant finish this book. Is anyone else out there from Pennsylvania? I cant get past the charges that were brought against the girl were by the ""State of Pennsylvania"". Ugh, Pennsylvania is not a STATE, it is a COMMONWEALTH! All legal papers are from the ""Commonwealth of Pennsylvania"". It is never referred to as a state. How did this get past her editors????"
1,I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS BOOK,"Where might it be? I don't remember ordering it - I definitely didn't receive it - DID I PAY FOR IT? IF SO, KINDLY RETURN MY MONEY.Thank you"
3,Does not include the antennas,"Perhaps it is obvious to other shoppers, but it was not to me. This unit does not include any antennas. If your current antennas are the proper gauge, you can unscrew them from your AP unit and attach them to this base. But you really need the additional high-gain antenna kit to use this unit."
3,"Great songs, but disappointed.","The collection of songs found on these discs was great some of their best, but the fact that every song was narrated was really irritating. I mean if you just want to listen to music I would not recommend this album."
1,don't buy,Doesn't fit a sm58 or 48. Contacted the seller (Xtreme Barware) and was just told that it did and that I was wrong and to return it. I stomped it out of anger.Should have stuck with Musician's Friend.
2,"Good background preparation, but needs update !","ACCESS IN LONDON was very good preparation, but needs an update (last published in 1996). There have been alot of changes-and improvements."
3,Professional but boring,"You can tell that the instructor is professional and appreciates practicing the moves through repetition. However, I became very bored with it after an hour. She taught certain moves that I caught on to very quickly and spent too much time on practicing each move. Then, each move that was taught was later enhanced with a shimmy (fast shaking). Repetition is good because it is hard to add the shimmy with it, but it was so boring to me."
2,Okay....but not worth the money,"This was the first in a series of bellydance DVDs I've purchased recently. It was fine for practice, but once I bought a couple of others I realized how bland, not well-thought-out and kind of lazy this DVD is. The drills are unimaginative, you get some good basics practice in the beginning but the explanations aren't that thorough if you're a beginner, and both the structure and the content pale in comparison to other DVDs I've purchased. If it were $20 cheaper, I'd say go for it, but as expensive as it is I wouldn't get it again. In fact, since all of the material she covers can be found on my other DVDs, I will probably sell this one back. I have no problem with Ansuya- she was engaging and her performance at the end was great, and I plan at some point in the future to purchase her ""Hot Combinations,"" but I feel like ""Lavish Layers"" wasn't worth the money I spent on it."
4,Nice dvd,"Ansuya has great technique and it's a pleasure watching this dvd.Still, I find it hard to actually learn her moves - but that could just be me of course. I wouldn't recommend this dvd to a beginner, though. Basically, all she does is say 'this is how the move is done' and then shows it. I would have liked a bit more instruction.(And, on the contrary to an earlier review, to which I agree on most points, I did find the 'bloopers' funny ;) )"
3,Not enough views,"this is a good dvd however, she doesn't spend much time on each view so it is hard to make sure you are doing it right."
5,Beautiful Music,This music is absolutely divine. If you're looking for something to totally relax you this would do it!
5,Extrodanary Story and Pictures,"this is the most wounderful story. yan does a beautiful job telling the story through his illistrations and words. I recomend this story from the ages 8 to adult. i am positive you will be happy to be a proud owner of this book. the illistration just left me speechless theey are so beautiful. i recomend this book to all the dreamers out there, and everyone who loves beautiful pictures."
4,Good bed for price,I bought this bed because relatives were visiting. I was surprised that the sheets fit perfectly and they said it was comfortable. Full was a little small for two people and it was harder to inflate with foot pump I had and seemed to lose a tiny bit of air after two nights. But all and all very nice bed for the price. Glad I bought it and yes would recommend especially at low price.
3,It's Okay,"I ordered a full size for my full size bunk beds. I have one just like it that I bought years ago and it has done very well. This one seems to lose air quicker. Maybe because it is newer and it is still ""stretching out""? For the price that you pay it does the job for an overnight use but I would not recommend it for everyday use."
4,good camping mattress,"This mattress is comfortable and big. It lost some air the first night, but not the 2nd after I tightened the air port."
4,Turns unfriendly futon into a comfy bed,"The cement-like comforts of our guest-room futon were significantly improved when we laid this air mattress over the top, at (obviously) far less than the cost of a new mattress. For anyone in a similar futon-enhancement situation, this is a great solution for occasional use. It also brings a low-lying futon up to regular-bed height, which is nicer for guests.A very satisfying return on a tiny investment. Use what you save to buy an air pump."
1,Lasted less than a year,First it developed leaks then it started having issues with the internal seams causing massive lumps to form in odd places on the bed. This made it impossible to use. No reply to emails to the company.
1,Horrible air mattress,"I didnt have much money and was sleeping on the floor so I decided to buy this air mattress. First night it lasted about an hour before I felt the floor, it was a bad call because now im broke and still on the floor. You definitely get what you pay for."
1,Used and broken,"We ordered 2, one was fine- the other had been opened and starting losing air as soon as it was filled. Don't have the time to mess around returning a cheap item- but I'm annoyed."
2,not too good,took these on a camping trip right out of the box and they didn't hold air very at all didn't go completely flat but didnt sleep well at all. Shipping was good and fast no problems other than didnt hold up very well.
2,Had problems,"I did not have success with this product. I was able to inflate it with the reverse air on my vacuumn cleaner and tighten the intake nozzle. However, the next morning the mattress was half flat. The following night I re-inflated, made sure the valve was tightened completely and woke up the next morning to a completely flat mattress. I am returning for another and will try again. If I can keep it inflated I will be satisfied with the product. However, the extra frustration of dealing with it has tainted me against online ordering for these kinds of products."
1,Intex: Filling America's Landfills One Airbed at a Time,"I purchased this product because I was tired of poorly made airbeds that fail to hold air after a few uses. This airbed had better than average reviews so I bought one. It worked well perhaps 3-4 times over a 3 month period. After that it would deflate within 4-5 hours. I had been very careful about in how I used and stored it and nevertheless, it still failed. This poorly made Intex airbed is now taking up space in a landfill somewhere.This airbed finally convinced me to spend the money and buy a durable, self-inflating, 3 inch thick Thermarest sleeping pad. Thermarest sleeping pads are not cheap, but they seem to be worth the money."
1,Good for one use only!!!!,"I wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing this. I used this mattress once and now it won't stay inflated. I can't imagine that there would be any hole in it after just using once but even if there is, how would I find it! Looks like it's hit or miss with this and I got one of the crappy ones. I won't purchase again."
