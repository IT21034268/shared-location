4,Small but comfortable,I like this seat even though it is small. It is comfortable enough that a person does not have to wear biking shorts. The price was compariable to a pair of biking shorts which is good when more than one person in the family is using the stationary bike.
2,Much smaller than I thought!,"Also not a soft as I expected. Very dissapointed. The name is misleading, seat is not comfortable, and does not eliminate ""pressure."""
5,Great!,This seat is just what I needed. No pressure anywhere. Very comfortableThe Schwinn seat was very simple to put on.
3,No more pain,"Seat feels a little strange at first, but I got used to it. Anything you can do in congunction with a ""normal"" seat, steering, turning, balance issues, eventually becomes second nature with this seat after some biking. My only complaint: When I set the seat height to where it needs to be, my body is more forward than I would like. I wish there was some way to adjust the seat rearward, toward the back of my bike. Eventually I will buy another seat to see if I can do better."
2,caused leg ache,"Thought it would be better than an extended front, but caused serious inflamation of the right leg nerve from the hip to foot. That is corrected by the origional seat. Learn something every day."
2,One among many - could not find a comfortable angle,"Could not find a comfortable angle with this seat, and it's smaller than you might think. I uploaded a picture here at Amazon that uses CDs as a comparison so that others can gauge the size.However, it did not apply pressure on the groin when I sat on it. Thus, technically, the product accomplishes the described task.*shrug*"
3,Doesn't work for me,"I like the idea of this seat, especially its width, but I also feel less secure while I'm riding. I had no idea that I was using the horn/nose to balance and stay on the seat, but I must be. I probably could become used to this one, but life is short, so I've chosen a wider seat with a horn."
3,"Better, but not quite right.","Because I'm a man, I can appreciate the ""freedom"" this seat offers my man-parts while riding. And because I'm a thin man, I double appreciate the wide cushion shape not digging into my posterior. Unfortunately, I find myself struggling not to slip forward right off the seat. And that's no good either. So I'm still on the hunt for the perfect bicycle seat... One that cushions my behind, doesn't squish my man-parts, and holds me in place while riding.Pros: Very comfortable on the behind. No pressure on the family jewels.Cons: As slippery as a slip 'n slide, even when using it on my stationary bike."
1,"No Pressure, however, no comfort","No matter what height or angle I adjusted the seat I could not find it comfortable. When pedalling down, the seat would dig into the back of my legs. To angle the front of the seat downward enough to eliminate this was so extreme that I would slide of the seat entirely. Still searching for a hornless comfortable seat."
4,Works well on cruiser,"This seat works well on my Electra cruiser. The pedals are forward and I sit straight up. So there is no pressure on my hands.It took some tinkering to get the angle right. Tilt the seat a bit too far forward and you do feel like you are going to slide off. A bit far backward, the front of the seat hurts the back of your legs. But I was able to get it right.There doesn't seem to be any loss of control. There might be if you were doing hardcore racing or mountain biking.With the stock seat, I felt like some things had been cut off down there after a ride, if you know what I mean. No feeling in certain appendages. Not a problem now."
2,unpleasant to ride with,"Well, this seat design *does* relieve the pressure on your important plumbing, however, I found it incredibly uncomfortable to ride with. You lose a lot of control, and the pedaling geometry is just wrong. Because optimal cycling position (for power transfer) has your legs almost fully extended, this means you have to sit on the very edge of this seat, putting almost all of your weight on your arms. I find this to be a suboptimal solution for someone who wants to ride hard and also be safe. Hopefully there is another seat on the market that does a better job. I will keep looking..."
4,Bike Seats are like Shoes... Gotta Try Em On.,"This is a nice big seat. The problem with bike seats is that everybody is different and you really do have to try it to see if it works for you. This seat is well made and fairly soft. What I don't think most people realize it that you can adjust the seat so the front end can go up or go down. If you feel like you are sliding off you probably are so.... loosen the two side bolts and tilt the front of the seat up. Takes about one minute if you have two 9/16 inch wrenches. On any bike you need to adjust the seat forward or backward to get the best fit. Serious bikers wouldn't be caught dead using this monster seat, but for casual biking and/or a stationary exercise bike it is hard to beat. Just my two cents."
1,Saddle seat,This item is a total joke. It might fit a person or child under 100 pounds. The dimensions were missing.I thought I was purchasing a saddle seat for an adult. Buyer beware.......
5,Great .. that is the only word i can say,"Because i was using the small seat , i got prostrate pain. This seat solved this issue..Thanks Schwin for this seat"
3,Not as viewed,"The picture as seen by me, appears to be indented on both sides-in reality, it is not. It's not soft either- disappointed."
1,Terrible,"I bought this saddle just to see how it would work. In order to pedal, the seat either has to be lowered significantly, or you have to sit on the edge of it. Either way, on the downstroke, the corners of the seat dig into the insertion points of your hamstrings. You lose a lot of power, and expend a lot of energy trying to stay on the seat. Don't buy it. Buy the E3 Form Gel instead."
2,Stephen Z Smith,"I rate the seat a two. As long as you don't have to pedal you are fine, While pedalling the edge of the seat digs into the back of your legs. Not very comfortable. I will continue to search for a comfortable seat."
2,Not for me,"Tried several adjustments, just couldn't make it work for me. It seemed that I was always slipping off the seat or sitting right on the edge of it. I ride my bicycle for exercise, but after riding my usual route with this twice, I was so exhausted and sore, I couldn't do it anymore. Although I could feel it in my arms, I really felt it in my upper legs. I guess you have to pick your discomfort in cycling."
3,Feels like I'm falling off,Fairly comfortable seat but it made me feel like I was going to fall off the front side. I'm female so I can't comment on pressure on other parts.
2,Irritated!,"Actual size is only about 9-10"" wide.. Very disappointed that size in inches is not listed by picture. Irritated now that I have to pay to return it. Looks bigger than it actually is. Will probably do a great job on my mom's exercise bike though!"
3,No pressure!!!!,I was not pleased with this purchase. The picture is exactly what you get a seat that has no pressure but if you have a large button. You can definitely feel the pressure of the sides cramping your but cheeks. Great for my nieces bike tho.
2,"Poor Design, Poor Quality","I purchased this seat to use for my bike with a stationary trainer but it's not working out. Even after messing with the tilt and position adjustments for an hour, I could not find a position that would be both comfortable and not interfere with leg movement.I was also not too impressed by the build quality. The seat mount itself is only screwed in at two places, leaving the other two points to be held by a cheap plastic slot. This is stressed every time you lean to the left or right, which does not provide enough support and makes it awkward to balance on. I doubt this thing would last very long with regular use.Your experience may vary depending on how you sit on your bike, but before purchasing this seat consider that the traditional bicycle seat is designed with a horn for a reason. You need the horn so the seat will give you enough support while not restricting leg movement."
2,Didn't feel stable,"I bought this seat as a replacement for my stationary bike. It is very comfortable to sit on, but when you start pedaling it doesn't feel right. At first I had the seat adjusted forward a little. When I pedaled, I felt like I was falling forward. Then I leaned it back and the front edge of the seat was bumping into the back of my legs where your leg meets your butt. It just didn't feel right."
4,bike seat for seniors,"The Schwinn No Pressure Bike Seat takes a bit of adjustment, but it's worth the effort. The seat is wide and does not press into the groin area. I bought two, one for each of my bikes. The seat is well worth the price and with it you can ride as long as you want without feeling pressed."
3,Comfort bike seat,My dad like the comfort of this seat but it didn't come with abracket to hold the seat in the bike.
4,Comfortable Seat,Great seat. Million percent better than the original which was a pain in the ... Needs some easy adjustments. Worth every cent.
2,Too Square,"I really wanted this seat to work. I adjusted the position on the rails and the height of the seat many ways, but couldn't get it to work.PROS: - Nice firmness; not too hard, not too soft.- seemed to. E great quality, ESP for the money- the noiseless feature really worked. No problems with my ""girl parts.""- cost!CONS: - The square shape does not give you room on the down pedal. As a result, my pedaling would push me forward , and I kept having to hike myself back up. They should have made the seat more triangular or arched, liket he moonsaddle.- no matter how you position it, the saddle is too far forward, and that really messed with my knees..Anyway, I have a very flat butt, so that might have contributed to the proble. My husband tried it, and though he wasn't a big fan, he didn't have the same kinds of problems as I did. Obviously, this seat works for many people. If you have knee issues, I would not recommend this!"
4,Great Upgrade to Exercise Bike,"To the other positive reviews, I just wanted to add that I replaced the factory seat on my Schwinn Evo Comp bike, with this ""hornless"" seat and I'm very happy with the change. Not only is it more comfortable for longer sessions, I also find that it brings all the leg muscles into play for a much fuller range of motion, and therefore a more challenging and effective workout."
3,Not what I expected.,Not what I expected: Seat was too hard and small! I was hoping for a softer comfortable seat and it was harder then my original seat.
2,Not for me,"I ordered this seat for my new Schwinn Tricycle for a more comfortable seat. I liked it even less than the original seat. It is waay too small for my buttocks and I was slipping off the seat. I'm a size 14. and weigh 150 lbs. It was like I was trying to sit ona child's seat. I returned it and ordered a Sergas seat, which is perfect for me!"
3,So so seat.,This seat was a bit of a disappointment. It is much shorter than pictured and not nearly as comfortableas the seat that came on my AD4. I would not buy it again.
3,Not a home run,"I love to ride my bike, but I hate pain. Unfortunately, even though we've put men on the moon, for some reason nobody has bothered to invent a comfortable bike seat. While this is an improvement over the standard shape, it is not a home run. It needs to be a few inches wider.Now don't go thinking that I'm just a guy with a big fat butt, and that is my problem, because I'm a bodybuilder, 5' 11"" and 180 lbs. So it's not that I'm not in shape.The best I can get out of this seat (with a pad added on top of it) is ten miles, and I just can't stand the pain after that.All of these seats just kill me, so I may have to go back to jogging for my cardio."
1,Painful after 5 minutes,"After reading the reviews for this seat,I decided to try it. It was very uncomfortable. I put extra padding on it but that did not help. There is no way to position it so it will be comfortable. It made my arms ache as well as my seat. This is not a good design. I'm sending it back and trying yet another style."
2,Not as Good as the Others Say,"I bought this seat pretty much on the recommendation of others who reviewed it here on Amazon. Unfortunately for me, it did not work out.The seat is not that wide (10 inches) compared to many other ""comfort"" saddles although the price is definitely right--about $30 cheaper than any other seat in the ""comfort saddle"" type category on the web.I used this on an electric scooter and I could not tip the seat forward like so many can do on a regular bicycle. Because of that, the full support effect of the wide saddle was lost. It was more uncomfortable than the seat I had, so I went out and purchased another saddle.I would say that if you can tip this saddle forward for your butt adjustment, you will be okay. But if you have a fixed seat post of some kind that makes forward/backward adjustment of the seat impossible, go with another wide saddle."
3,"Not Perfect (for me), But Better","I'm a woman and was getting irritated ""down there"" by my old seat so I purchased this seat. No horn is definitely better for my female parts but this seat is not really comfortable for me. A male friend has the exact same seat and he LOVES it. It's a very personal thing. I'm still in search of the ""perfect"" seat, meanwhile, the Schwinn No Pressure Bicycle Seat is what I'll ride on. After adjusting the seat angle, be sure to tighten the bolt or the seat will slip into a forward angle which will make you feel like you're falling off. Not having the horn between my legs is much better than a conventional bike seat but I would like more padding."
1,"Doesn't work for wider ""seats""....",I read the other reviews before purchasing and decided for the $$ it was worth a try. We found it very uncomfortable and went back to the original seat.
2,Not as comfortable as it looks...,"I purchased this seat for my cruiser style bike. The seat itself is very comfortable with its no pressure design. However, trying to ride my bike the seat kept pushing me forward and forced my knees into the handlebars. This seat might work better on a bicycle with really high handle bars.I have been using thisSchwinn Ultra Comfort Bicycle Seatand have been very pleased."
3,poor peter sam.,peter sam had a slate car incident. sir handel & duke almost fall off the cliff. rusty falls under sticks. duke gets stuck in the shed.
3,Quite a workout,As long as you have no desire to learn any tap technique at all this dvd is fine. It's very aerobic and the gal who leads it is very encouraging though a bit manic. I like that the back up dancers cover the entire range of skill level so I never felt like a failure and kept at it for a while.
1,Did not work on Mac or even PC,"I thought the info said it worked on a Mac, but it does not. So that may have been my bad. But I tried to install on my PC and it still did not work. Their help desk was less than helpful.However, I am very appreciative of the great support of Seven Seas, which was the reseller of the product. They were very helpful and worked with me in the returning of the product. I had to pay a 15% restocking fee that I was not excited about, but I knew that upfront when I ordered it.. So I can not blame them. Bottomline, I will go out of my way to buy products that I need from Seven Seas. They were a pleasure to work with .. Thanks!"
1,"Bad, bad, bad","Even if I carefully followed the instructions, it was impossible to get a clean text. Almost every word I scanned had one or two mistakes. The time to correct those mistakes amounts to the time it would take to type the text with two fingers, as I always type. In short, I have the Iris Pen ""Executive"" in the closet and I don't think I will ever use it again."
1,Beware...it doesn't work as advertised,This scanner makes too many errors and is pretty slow. I expected better after reading the other reviews.
3,Time It Takes To Scan,"I've read all the reviews posted as of 2-6-2009 re the IRIS pen and no reviewer talks about how long it takes to scan text. One person mentions one inch of text line per second. That to me means a horrible amount of time to scan lines of text. For reference imagine scanning a single 8.5x11 page of double spaced text and how long it would take, 7-8 seconds per line and then think a typical newspaper article and how long it would take........Do I have this all wrong?..the time factor? There has to be a better way using a better portable non feeding scanner. Even taking a pic and converting to a pdf you can work in would be better.....maybe, you could tag the pic with an audio clip too, as in explaining why you took the pic.....uummm sounds better all the time. Any ideas out there?joeyem@gmail.comJoe Mersnik, Sr."
1,It doesn't work,"I tried everything under the sun to get this scanner to work, loading new drivers, and not only did it not work, it crashed my computer and my laptop - lousy product."
4,"yes it work with vita , you have get vista soft at suport center.","yes it work well with my vista .it okay ,i use it some time."
4,Great accuracy,"I have been pretty impressed with the accuracy of this device. On one carefully scanned document with 12 point type, it was well over 99% accurate (better than my C-pen C600 which is about 95%). The pen is very quick with no pauses between lines scanned (the C-pen pauses between lines). The software was easy to install and it was running in a matter of minutes (a little easier than C-pen's serial port set-up). It also scans directly into applications (C-pen docs must be copied and pasted).The downside is that it must be attached to a computer via the USB (unlike the C-pen) and that limits its portability. It also is a little bulkier than the C-pen.Overall, it does a good job on a variety of tasks. If you favor portabilty, try the C-pen. If you want accuracy, try the Iris Pen II."
5,Simply great!,"My brother gave this as a gift to my twin 6yr olds and they love it. Though the book is recommended for 9+ kids, there are lots of games and activities much younger kids can play. Introduction to each game / activity describe the origin of the game in a way that we can imagine how people played the game long ago. Probably most games can be included in weekly themes of primary school class lessons. For now I let the kids work out the strategies themselves. Probably we will revisit the games / activities few years and analyze them mathematically. Also there is a lot of variety between games and activities compared to a ""kids activity"" book full of 100 mazes or 100 kidoku puzzles."
3,"Beware of the ""Example"" Problems","Overall, the textbook is decent. However, when it comes to reading the example problems in the text, one can, and probably will, become very confused. In my opinion, the purpose of an example problem in the text is to completely break down all the steps towards finding the solution to the problem for the reader, especially one that is a first-timer in DE. This book fails to do so. As a first-timer in DE, I became more confused reading the example problems than I was when perusing the text. The explanations were neither lucid nor thorough enough for my liking. But do not be discouraged first-timers! It is possible to earn your A using this textbook. With the right amount of motivation and study sessions, your A will come. If I could get an A in this class as a college freshman, then anyone could."
5,Good job,Everything was fine. Came when it was suppose to in great shape. No problems with order so I don't know about customer support.
5,Great Book,"I am very pleased with my order. It is a brand new differential equations book and it was shipped very fast. Thank you, and I look forward to ordering more from you again!"
2,too much theory,they prove EVERY single theorem in the most grating way... good chapters on applications though.
5,Well written and entertaining,"I was sorry to reach the end -- I will miss the narrator and his quirky town, relatives, friends and neighbors. The story moves smoothly from reality to fantasy and back. It's honest, touching, and subtly funny. My recommendation -- read this book!"
4,For the fence straddlers,"Ok, sure this may not be true metal but, I still thought it was good. I'm hard to please with music, either they growl too much or the riffs aren't heavy enough. This was right up my alley. If you like bands like Mudvayne and Mushroomhead, then you'll probably like these guys too."
2,Hm.,"Phoenix mourning.. what to say?This is very typical of the screamo scene today. Typical isn't always bad, because for a first CD, this is quite good for the genre.I do think though, that the songs do begin to sound the same and that the singer's voice is sometimes really annoying.I listen to a lot of heavy music too.. and this stuff doesn't make me want to punch walls or anything, but it's pretty cool anyway."
1,I'll be so happy when this trend dies out,"Then I won't have to sit through bands like this on the metal channel while i'm waiting for Megadeth or Iron Maiden to play. I first learned of this crappy band when I heard that s*** festival of a song ""Contrast""(I turned it before my ears bled). This isn't metal. It's screamo with a metallic edge. S***ty hardcore screaming and whiny emo singing make up the vocals.The guitars are about on level with Atreyu in skill-they suck. There's no solos on this CD at all. Nonexistant bass and sloppy drumming make up the rhythm section. Avoid this and Threat Signal(they stole Meshuggah's sound and made it metalcore). Save your money for Slayer or Megadeth's new CDs."
5,Warm and smooth,"They are just the right size for anyone,and the adjustible springs are enclosed in a plastic sleeve that makes them comfortable to wear. I've worn them in below freezing, windy weather, and they kept my ears quite comfortable."
4,An essential addtion to every horseperson's library.,"Hilary Page Self is a horse owner who has researched, collected and used the traditonal herbal remedies on horses. Many of the materials are readily available, and/or obtainable. A Modern Horse Herbal is written in an easy to use and clear style. Being British she also includes American terms to avoid confusion. Though only 175 pages, it is full of valuable information. It is especially useful, because she encourages the owner to work together with modern medicine, along with a qualified veterinarian."
4,Good starting point for learning about herbs and horses,"This is my first book I have been able to read on herbal remedies for horses. It is conscise, with a section describing many popular herbs and their uses, along with a section of common aliments and their treatments. The information provided on other forms of alternative therapies is a little skimpy. But it is called Modern Horse Herbal, and the herbal information is excellent."
1,You get what you pay for,"This phone is inferior. Used as a wall mount, you have to squat to read the caller ID info. Terrible feedback when using speakerphone with the volume passed half level. NO MUTE BUTTON! And...I can hear a radio station when using the handset. The 1 plus...no AC required."
5,What a GREAT teapot!,"This teapot is a dream come true for all of us who have spent years trying to strain loose tea leaves from our teapots, losing heat while trying to remove large tea bags from teapots, or doing all sorts of other wacky things to brew loose tea. With one push of the plunger on this teapot, you have a teapot ready to go. What a great invention! The teapot is easy to clean (the section at the bottom of the basket which stops the brewing also makes it super-easy to wash tea leaves out later on) and the stainless steel and glass make it much less likely to stain or change the taste of future brewings. I highly recommend this teapot to all tea aficionados, especially those who love loose tea!"
1,This product is horrible; customer service is worse,"I owned this product for about a month. Suddenly when I poured in hot water, the glass broke. I called customer service and they do not stand behind thier products at all. I received a sorry we are out of stock on that replacement part and there is no date when they will receive more. Basically they will not stand behind their products."
1,Bodum Very Poor Quality,"I purchased the Bodum glass teapot, loved the design and mechanism for brewing tea. Like the other reviews, one day I pour hot water into it and the glass broke. Then I was foolish enough to purchase another one. I put it in the dishwasher and the glass broke. So I decided to stay away from their glass teapots and went on the Bodum site to purchase a stainless steel one. The tea just tasted funny - like some metallic particules leached into the tea. I returned it and Bodum charged a restocking fee for the return. Between paying for shipping, the restocking fee and paying for the return shipping - I was out almost $40! Stay away - do not buy Bodum. They look good but very poor quality."
2,Bodum Assam 4 Cup Glass Tea Press,"I'm up in the air on this product by Bodum. For a few days my wife was making great tea and then while cleaning it the glass carafe just broke apart, I wish I had read ""Super Consumer's"" review before purchase. I would have never bought the glass version. I had wrestled whether to buy the plastic version of this teapot or the glass version with the stainless steel filter. I should have bought the plastic version, it may have lasted longer, but I will never know, I don't have alot of faith in Bodum products currently after my experience and reading the other review.Well I'm off to Search the Great Amazon Database for another Tea Press"
2,Too fragile,"I have used this teapot 3 times now. It was a Christmas gift and I loved it. Unfortunately, it is not even New Year's and it is broken. I don't know if the glass thickness varies from pot to pot, but I noticed that this was very thin when I opened it and was careful whenever I handled it. I had washed it and was drying it, holding it by the handle to dry the outside of the pot, when I heard a little cracking sound. I hadn't bumped it on anything! I guess I held the handle too hard while wiping the pot. It cracked on the pot, near the bottom seal of the handle. I can maybe glue over it, as it didn't split open or piece apart, but I am very disappointed and won't be buying any other Bodum products."
5,Bodum Teapot,"Went through a host of other options. Bought this, very satisfied and recommend this product. Excellent match - utility and high quality!"
4,Tea +,"Having always been a teabag tea drinker, I didn't really know what tea really should taste like.With the Bodum teapot I now appreciate tea for the first time, the pot brews great tea."
5,I love it and use it daily!,"My boyfriend surprised me with this teapot about a year and a half ago. I use it almost every day during Spring, Fall and Winter... sometimes twice per day. I love it. Most of the time I use it to microwave water to almost-boiling, then drop in a couple teabags. I don't often use the filter.The glass does seem very thin and lightweight so I am wary of breaking it but it doesn't seem any different than a typical coffee pot so I just wash it by hand and take care not to bang it on anything."
5,"Excellent Product, but with some flaws","I have owned this teapot for 3 years and have used it at least once a week. The teapot is very convenient in terms of cleaning and brewing tea. Some people have had theirs break, and that's understandable. I could imagine it would break if I had dropped it. I try to be careful with it, as I do with wine glasses.Pros:-Easy brewing of teas-Easy to clean-Keeps tea hot for approximately 1 hour-It looks cool and people comment on itCons:-You have to hold the lid when pouring the last cup-Plunger does not create a tight seal between the leaves and water-The stainless steel infuser can get brown stains after awhile; I've learned to live with them-The glass is fragile; so be careful-Avoid squeezing the infuser or you can make dents in it"
2,"Good design, poor execution","We purchased this because we loved the design of the infuser. In practice, the infuser is very effective and very convenient to use. The biggest problem is the the glass pot. The glass is extremely thin. We tried to be extra careful in cleaning the pot, but 2 months and the inevitable happened. When trying to pull the infuser out, it tilted too much and broke the glass.Bodum has a great idea, but it would definitely be to their benefit to put the infuser in a ceramic pot that can handle a little more everyday use."
4,"Its fragility makes me nervous, but I haven't broken it yet...","I married into ownership of this teapot. It's probably not something I would ever have purchased myself, because I am incapable of owning glass things without breaking them, and the glass of this pot is very thin. But, I haven't broken it yet, so maybe it's stronger than I give it credit for.It's very attractive and the design is clever since you don't have to remove the hot tea leaves in order to stop the steeping. Unlike the two other teapots we own, this one's spout doesn't dribble when you pour. I also appreciate that it is easy to handwash because the mouth is large enough that my hand easily fits inside it (and this is an important quality because we're afraid it would break if we put it in the dishwasher).Bottom line is that it's exceeded my expectations and, although I'll probably break it at some point and may not buy another one after that, I'm glad to own this one."
4,I'm buying an other but...,"I really wish Bodum sold replacement glass for this.I had this teapot for over 18 months and I love it. It makes wonderful tea, cleanup is easy, and it's quite pretty. I like being able to see the colour of my tea brewing as well.I broke it. I've been pretty careful with it, but I'd bumped it a few times over the past year and a half. Saturday, however, I hit it from the inside with the stainless filtre and blam! a hole appeared. Sigh...That said, I'm buying an other pot as soon as I finish this review. I'll be more careful next time."
5,Tea for 2,This is a great tea pot. Its the 2nd one we have purchased. You can see the tea brewing. The filter process is also excellent. Buy one !!
2,COULD BE BETTER,"Well made and good looking TEA POT. INFUSER NEEDS IMPROVEMENT to better keep the tea in the pot at a steady rate of preferred strength. Part of the problem, at least with mine, is that ""BURRS"" on the holes inside of the infuser screen have caused premature wear on the rubber ring of the plunger. This is making mine progressively less efficient. THIS IS A NEEDLESS FLAW. I don't know if replacement rings are available, but I'll soon be looking! I would most welcome an unflawed screen at the same time!"
4,Works Great,I was a little hesitant about this product because it was replacing a teapot of similar design (but a different manufacturer) that did not have the plunger lid. I viewed the plunger lid as a potential nuisance with trying to get a quick cup while the tea was still steeping. Also I thought it would be hard to keep clean and a general pain. I was also concerned about mesh size on the stainless filter as it looked to small in the pictures. After using the teapot almost daily for a couple of months the only issue I have with it is that the plunger in hard to put in the dishwasher. My other concerns proved to be groundless and I would buy another of the same design.
2,Too Fragile,"These teapots are nice to look at and function well, but I have bought 2 of them now and they have both broken in less than a year near the glass handle and are just too fragile for frequent use. I would suggest buying a pot without a glass handle."
4,Stainless Steel Does Not Mean Plastic,"Overall, I am a Bodum fan and like their simplistic approach to their design.However, for this ASSAM TEAPOT, I am little ""tiffed"" at the fact that the product description states STAINLESS STEEL INFUSER WITH PLASTIC ""KNOB"". I am good with that as written. However, in actuality, the round PLUNGER (the part that touches the tea and sits soaking in the hot water when pressed down) is made of black plastic with a rubber seal around it.SO, for those concerned about plastics and possible chemicals from being released (after heated round food), this will not be for you. I know some manufacturing statements might say ""chemical free"", but one just never knows."
2,Not so great,"Although the Wompkee creatures themselves are cute and the overall story is fine, the Ice Queen continually uses the word ""hate"" throughout her scenes in the movie. Perhaps I'm in the minority here, but I don't like hearing that word, particularly with the inflection used in a young children's movie. I don't quite understand why it was necessary."
2,Not my favorite...,"Though the book had some useful mythology, i had an issue with not only the grammar but the copy-paste seeming format. It seemed like the author just did a google search on the Morrigan and pasted all the half decent parts into a book. The same point is repeatedly reiterated and it gets redundant. Considering that there is so much conflicting information about the Morrigan, i was disappointed that more was not clarified."
4,good quality for the price,"I bought this item recently , and washed it b4 using.No change ,the fabric holds pretty good and would last loads of subsequent washes.Nice reversible option.Overall satisfied with the product , also got it on time.But would not buy cotton online as the same item made in India, will sell for no more than a Rs.800 in high end department stores in India!!Will surely shop for cotton on my next India trip!"
2,newmexican,"First , the color is not at all what i expected. They should say purple/deep plum instead of lilac/purple. I was expecting a much softer lilac.Now i am going to use only one side of this sheet. second the sticthing that makes the pillowcases reversible also makes them look very unattractive and cheap. And the was a misalignment on one of the pillowcases. I am not going to return it cause it is not worth the hassle, but i am going to use these sheets only when all other sheets are dirty."
5,Great Deal!,"I'm not a sheet expert but this seems to be a wonderful deal. Quality is top notch, colors are great, and reversibility is a very nice feature, just use what looks best or mix it up for a change. Excellent price!"
5,A Wonderful Buy!,"The sheets matched perfectly with my room, which is the main reason I purchased them. The quality is great! The sheets are very soft and the colors are amazing. I would recommend this product to anyone. The reversability is also a nice luxury. It was a wonderul purchase!"
4,sheet set,"Not the smoothest set of sheets that I have owned, but ok. And I love the color combo. Nice deep fitted sheet."
5,I love these sheets,"These sheet are soft and silky. They were over-size for my bed but shrunk after laundering them, so don't trim them until after they have been laundred.."
3,Sheets,"I am pretty much satisfied. The sheets however after washing & drying, are a little wrinkly, not as smooth as I would like. Still not bad, for the price at the time."
3,Cute Idea,"This is a cute idea and a cute product, but they are not very soft. From the feel of them I really do not think they will get softer with washing."
5,Great Sheet set,This is a really beautiful set of sheets. Both my niece and her daughter love purple and not only is it a lovely color in contrast but you can also see the great quality for the price.
5,great sheets!,"I ordered my sheets 5/3, I just received my sage sheets last night 5/9, the color is great, they feel wonderful, I'm really happy with them. Its great you basicly get 2 sets of sheets for half the price of one. I got my for 19.99 with free shipping. I was going to order more for gifts but thought i should see how they were first. Now that i know, I came online 5/10 to order some for my Mom and Sister but now they raised the price. I guess the word got out."
2,"Packs a punch, not very tasty","If need something to give you an energy boost, with no regard to flavor, this is for you."
4,Not only for iPods but trouble going into lighter outlet,"The version of this product that I bought had the connector that goes into the earphones of the player, and not the connector that goes in the underside of an iPod. The best about it is that it works with any player that has an earphone outlet.What is a bit of a problem is that, eventhough it is quite compact, the body of the transmitter might keep the plug that goes into the car lighter from going all the way in. At least in my car (a VW Jetta) the transmitter has to be forced into the lighter."
3,The chick is hot and Floyd blows the house away!,"There are many baffling moments in this film. Many times I said outloud ""Huh?"" But who are we to critique Antonioni? Any one who is smart enough to use Pink Floyd and Jerry Garcia on a soundtrack is OK with me and there is a very interesting social commentary going on in this film. The girl in this film is super hot! Who cares if she can't act! The orgy in the desert, and the house blowing up to Floyd's ""Come in number 51..."" are really the best reasons to see this film. The soundtrack is available on disc with some tasty gems plus very good out-takes from Floyd and Garcia. This review will probably help no one but so what. Go back to your computer fried lives drones..."
3,Flawed Masterpiece,"First, this DVD is Russian, poor quality and not in wide screen. But it's the only one available so we have to make do. This is the weakest of Antonioni's English language films: ""Blow Up"" and ""The Passenger"" are much better. So what went wrong: lousy, amateur actors, multiple script writers (incl Sam Shepard) make a real pig's ear of any pretense of a story and some rabid anti-Americanism. But it's worth seeing for one reason only: the final 10 mins of the desert house blowing up. It's up there with ""The Passenger's"" final famous tracking shot and the park scenes in Blow Up. Only for die-hards. In the same vein, check out the original ""Vanishing Point"" and ""Electra Glide in Blue"""
2,Knocking Boots,"Let's talk about this edition, since everybody reading this probably already has an opinion about the movie. This is a Russian edition, with Russian menus, Russian liner notes, and Russian narration (which thankfully can be turned OFF). It is most likely a bootleg, since the focus is pretty significantly fuzzy throughout, and the film is not to my knowledge officially available on DVD due to music clearances. The DVD cuts off at the last scene, before the credits. The ""extras"" consist solely of four crew bios... written in Russian.On the good side, the sound is clear, color balance is good, and this was dubbed from a print without any dirt or splices. And it's cheap! Perhaps there's something APPROPRIATE about bootlegging a film about revolutionary politics of the 1960s...."
4,MISUNDERSTOOD.,"Yes I think its a great film. From the wooden acting of the leads to the Pink Floyd extravaganza at its finale, Zabriskie Point never fails to astound with its incomparable visuals and mastery. Mr Antonioni bravely flings himself on the minefeild of the sixties in America and the results are unlike anything else. Sure to confound most everyone expecting a trite fable, what one receives instead is a blisteringly funny and beautiful comment on a culture too obsessed with consumerism and ""success"" to notice much besides its own narcicissm. Brilliant."
3,A glorious failure,"I am well aware that ZABRISKIE POINT is often cited as one of the worst movies ever made, but I could not agree less. Although the two lead actors are at best wooden, and the story highly improbable and maybe even baffling, I found myself completely mesmerized in spite of this.Visually it is a stunner and the contemporary music lendsa foundation to the film that gives it a certain validation. I think the movie captures the spirit of revolution that permeated the so-called 60s and it does it in a way that is essentially nonverbal. I found this movie haunting and I've watched it many times both in the theatre and at home. It fails, for sure, but it fails gloriously and it does reveal an era gone by in a mannerthat few films of the time do. See it but keep your hopes in check."
2,Noble failure,"This late 60s period piece is full of cringe-worthy moments, especially the terrible acting and dialogue, but the photography is still stunning, and the soundtrack, full of Grateful Dead music, is still good. The scenes in LA are interesting for their vintage looks at a city no longer there as it was in the 60s. The plot is non-existent. This was a European director's take on American youth during the war protest days when peace was everything and the cops were ""pigs,"" worthy of being shot or else they might shoot you for having long hair. The ending is very surreal, extended slow-mo scenes of blow-ups. Freaky in a 60s way. It's all pretty tedious, though the orgy scene in the desert, while awkward to look at, was pretty suggestive for those days. The acting and dialogue between the two main characters is stilted at best. They seem like rank amateurs, which they were."
5,Revolutionary Film,"This movie is a trip right to the Sixties. What is particularly good besides the sex scene is the campus dialogue that goes on in the beginning. This scene features non other than Kathleen Cleaver who was Eldridge Cleaver's wife. She seems to be playing herself during that period. Also good music especially, the Rolling Stones song called ""You've got the silver""."
3,The special time of the special ordinary people,"A movie is about the seventies of the twenties century, the time of a ""sexual revolution"" and sharp changes in society much pushed by student political activity depicted in this US-based Antonioni's work.An activist stole a mini-jet (yeah, these States prior to 9/11!) to reach a personal-plus assistant of a tycoon to have a thrust in a heart of a desert, Zabrinskie Point, just to be murdered on his return to Los Angeles private airport. And a personal assistant had taken revenge-or it was her secret agenda initially-of blowing up a nice dwelling of a boss of her.It is too much left beyond my understanding, presented by a surrealistic way, not allowing more to write."
2,ANTONIONI AT HIS MOST PRETENTIOUS,"Give an European art film director too much money (as Hollywood always does) and this is what you can expect. The photography (despite the laughably unending house explosion at the finale) and the music aside (buy the album instead of the movie), the most memorable dialogue spoken by the catatonic actors as they sit in the sand and comment on the desert, She: ""It's beautiful."" He: ""It's dead."" So's the movie."
4,Ok movie,"It's not such a bad film. I have seen better, but this film is not THAT bad. You just have to REALLY be into the whole sixties thing to enjoy the film.The soundtrack is awesome though, worthy to check that out."
3,Cool Imagery and Floyd is Here!,"Plot is uninteresting(I forget what this one's about!), characters dull, but the images(such as the explosions with ""Come in No. 51 Your Time is Up by Pink Floyd blaring in background is AWESOME!)are cool. I like the scene where the two main characters go down into the Point and make love (rolling around in the sand), and there are 2 other Floyd tracks here too(Crumbling Land & Heart Beat Pig Meat).If you have been partying, watch this one."
2,pink floyd,"Probably one of the most useless movies I've ever seen, but having a fixation for everything Pink floyd - I felt it important to have in my collection of their works. Maybe it's my lack of imagination, but if you've purchased this film, let it be known - it isn't for intelectual balance. What little Pink Floyd contributed was in a bizzare part of the film in which 8-10 shots of a house exploding was shown in a chaotic fashion. Strange film, but one has to consider the era in which it was shot."
1,Poorly designed/ and deceptive marketing,"This is 2.4 GHZ ANALOG. It is NOT a DIGITAL! Digital is sharper and more secure than Analog. Years ago they started selling DIGITAL and I have no idea why so many are sneaking in poorer quality Analog phones without clearly stating so. Next time you go to best buy, etc take a look. If the phone does not say 900 mhz or 2.4 Ghz DIGITAL then it is analog. Retailer mix them all together and many associates don't even realize. I would recommend a 900 Mhz DIGITAL over 2.4 Ghz Analog. Another thing to notice is that many phone will say 2.4 Ghz with Digital Answering machine. This usually means that the answering machine is digital but the phone is not. It has to say 2.4 GHz digital phone. The companies are good at sneakingly getting us to buy cheap crap at inflated prices. This 2.4 Ghz analog phone should be less. They are hoping that consumers assume it is digital.Poor quality/Caller ID area scratches and becomes unreadable/Phone acts up/"
3,touch keys too loud,"good clarity, weak distance, SOUND WHEN YOU PRESS NUMBERS TOO LOUD. Too bad, becaus it would have been a good phone for the money."
1,How did this get past quality control?,"We have this phone in our small business office, and it is without question the worst phone I have had the displeasure of using. I recognize that there are a number of sources of interference on the fifth floor of our office building, but the static is aweful. Even sitting less than two feet from the receiver there is static. Outgoing sound, as mentioned by other reviewers, is also poor. We are going to switch back to our (very) old phone because this unit is truly unbearable. It is mind-boggling that the folks at GE have actually put this device in the hands of real customers."
1,Aweful !,"This is NOT a good phone....I was needing to replace my Panasonic 2-line cordless phone KX-TG2267 with a phone that has a longer talk time battery life..this GE phone doesn't ring consistently, has static and clicking, all while I'm within 20ft of the base....It's a total WASTE of money !!....if only panasonic could improve the battery life on the before mentioned model, it would be the perfect 2-line cordless phone....I hope someone at Panasonic reads this and takes note !!"
3,Not for beginners,"After a good introductory section the book launches into Sudokus at the beginner, novice, intermediate, and expert levels. I do not advise this book for beginners. My average completion times (although they may be slow compared with many others!) were 26 minutes for the first 5 of the ""beginner"" level, and 39 minutes for the ""expert"" level. For ""beginner"" in other publications my average is about 6 minutes. In my opinion the ""beginner"" level puzzles are much too difficult and will probably lead to the book receiving little attention from beginners."
2,All expert puzzles,"My book had all expert puzzles although it had labels for beginner to expert. I don't know if I got a different edition but I have done Sudoku puzzles online which are far easier than the so called beginner ones in this book. The first ones are the same difficulty as the final ones. When you average 27 given numbers in the beginner section and also the expert section, you know someone made a mistake when they printed the book or did their program to create the puzzles. If you are already an expert, this is good for working the puzzles. If you are a beginner, you will likely get very discouraged. You can use the helps in the beginning and create some of your own to be able to work the puzzles."
3,Decent phone,"Was looking for a phone for the bedroom. This one fit the bill (almost). I have not had any problems adjusting the contrast (you press down on the arrow buttons to adjust when you first program the phone). The caller id display has worked fine once you program it with your area code. My only complaint is that I wish the company had designed it with a ""backlit"" caller id display. It's a bit of a hassle to turn on the bedside lamp at night to see who's calling on the caller id display. It has a lighted key pad which is great for dialing in a darkened room. The ringer volume can be adjusted to a low or high level. Works fine."
1,Why the free advertising,"In addition to the below mentioned issues, the phone has a large annoying Southwestern Bell logo along the side that does not come off."
1,Don't buy this phone!,"I never thought I would care to write a review about a telephone, but this is the worst phone I can imagine. First, as described by other reviewers, when you hold the phone to your ear, your cheekbone hits the center button resulting in a beeping noise on the line. Also, the LCD display on the base unit and one handset stopped working after less than six months of use. I also agree that the buttons on the base unit are not very user friendly. Finally, why do phone manufacturers keep making home telephones smaller and smaller like cell phones? Do they think we want to carry them in our purses?"
3,room for improvement,although the phone is lightweight and easy to use it has a few drawbacks. #1. can't get an additional handset unless ordering from internet or by phone. #2. can't get a replacement battery unless same as above. #3. doesn't have a locator button to find misplaced handset. that's just a few that have caused me endless hours of frustration. Look into other models.
2,"Features were good, display was horrible","I used this phone for several years. The features are decent -- nothing to complain about, really, and I liked the speakerphone in the base unit.The major problem I had with this phone is, as others have mentioned, the display on the handsets is defective, and stops displaying anything gradually. The first time, SBC sent me a replacement GH4010, but the display went out on those handsets eventually as well.Overall, I don't recommend buying this phone."
2,"Works great, for awhile","System works as advertised, but one handset lost its LED display. No repair help on website, item discontinued, hard to find replacements."
1,Keep Looking,It seems like a good buy for the what you get but after a few months the LCD display starts to go and the sound will cut in and out. I had the handsets replaced once and the problem wasn't fixed. The phones are just poor quality.
1,Don't Buy It!,"This phone sucks. After less than one year, both handsets are completely unreadable. What a rip off. We pay for caller ID and can't even read it."
1,Regretting buying this phone,"We thought it would be great to use as an intercom. Now two of the handset displays are dead. Also, the intercom is annoying because it has a very strong echo; this happens when we are ""conferencing"" two phones as well. And, we have the beep-out problem, too... this makes it nearly impossible to hold a conversation. I thought it was just our set, but seems like others have had this problem!"
4,I Like it!!!,"I've had this phone for 2 months now with no problems. I rent a house so it was not practical for me to get phone jacks installed in all my rooms. This was a great solution! I do wish the base unit had the same features as the handsets though, such as caller ID number storage & memmory dialing. I'm finding it hard to find single handsets to expand the system too. Over all, I'm glad I bought it!!!"
1,Worthless Phone - Don't waste your money.,"This phone has the worst reception I have ever had. My 900MHZ has a longer range. This phone makes you sound like your in a tunnel, and it is very hard to hear other people on it.Do not waste your money. The phone definitely looks nice, but functionality is not so great."
1,Display Issues,I can't say as I would reccommend this phone to anyone. We've had one for less than 6 months and now both phone displays are dead and unusable. Getting it fixed requires that the entire unit be returned whne there is nothing wrong with the base unit. If it's expandable then I don't understand why this entire system has to be returned to fix handsets. Obvioulsy it is not what it is advertised to be.
2,Bad Display,Purchased this phone and the display on the base unit does not work. Low volume on base unit. Was easy to setup the handsets though. I liked the style and size of this system.
1,"Good for a while, then blank!","These phones were great for us, sound ok, but now after about 2 years, two of the three screens are out. I have not tried to put in a new battery because the phone still works, and they cost about 29.00 bucks. I am disappointed in the quality as well as so much of the electronics out there these days. The old phones still work great, but too bad they are not cordless."
1,Save your money!,"I wish that I had checked online first before I went to the store and got this phone. I haven't had this phone for a year yet, and I have lost the display in both phones. Why am I paying for caller id when I can't even see it? I also get the beeping that everyone else is getting. Save your money and find another phone."
1,WAIST,"At first I thouht this phone would be great. I would be able to have one in my bedroom as well as the livingroom. Great idea, wrong phone. I have not experienced the beeping noise like others have written about, mine was more of an echo when I would talk. Now, the caller id display has totally gone out on one of the hand sets and is starting to go out in the other. I would not recomend this phone to anyone!"
2,Poor sound quality,"The static, hiss and echo of this phone is terrible compared to the clean sound of my existing 900Mhz Panasonic phones. I am taking this back and going to try a Panasonic expandable system instead."
4,An amazing look into one of the unheralded theathres of war.,"Hurricane over the Jungle offers an intruiguing account of the heroic actions of the RAF in south eastern Asia during World War Two. The authour combines an account of aerial action and a look into the daring lives of fighter pilots during the war. Kelly also describes the feelings of hopelessness and desperation which the men of the RAF felt during this time. While it moves a bit slow in places, Hurricane over the Jungle is a tense and exciting novel which keeps you turning the pages. If you are interested in World War Two aviation accounts, this book may be just what you are looking for."
3,"Good dialogue, bad stories","I'm impressed with the dialogue and even the acting in these two 45-minute features, but the storylines tend to be wandering messes that have too many plot twists and totally lack direction. Neither one has a neat conclusion."
1,a disappointment,"I was very unhappy with this ""movie"". I love and collect Christmas films and this was such a bore that I could not watch either story the whole way through. My friend's daughter didn't even want to watch it."
2,Very little material for book club discussions,"I expect the reason this novel was published is because it is a unique autobiography. However, it's only half a story - assume this is contrived in the hope of selling the other half at a later date. The author's reconstruction of dialogue is to be admired, as well as the descriptions of her life of poverty and deprivation. More to be admired is the character of her mother who managed to produce and provide for eleven children in an unmarried state, while coping with an irresponsible father. Can only recommend if you're looking for a holiday read. Very little material for book club discussions."
2,Tomato Slicing Guide,Tomatoes have to be small to fit the slicer. Doesn't work with large tomatoes. Item fell apart after a few uses. Not a great item.
3,Nice case for the most part,"Unfortunately, the one I received is slightly askew, so the right side of the case covers a small portion of the screen and the pause/on-off button. I would imagine this is probably inevitable, given the small size of the case, and it's no big deal; certainly not worth returning it. The leather is lovely, the magnetic catch works well and it has a nice feel to it over all. I like the fact that it smells like an expensive pair of shoes. I bought it to protect the Zune when it is kicking around in my bag and it should serve that purpose well."
3,"Decent features, bad sound","I sort of expected 2.4 GHz would be better than 900 MHz (bigger number and all) but it's not the case with this phone. My old Southwestern Bell 900 MHz analog phone sounds *a lot* clearer than this phone. Every time I speak it creates a kind of aura of static to my ear, wrapped around my voice...the other party has been able to hear me fine, though. Otherwise has a nice VIP caller feature, but I'm returning it. Are all 2.4 GHz phones so disappointing?"
1,Worst. Pirate movies. EVER.,"I got this for $10 at Best Buy, and it's... well, not worth watching sober. Basically, it's nine totally craptastic pirate movies. Some are as old as 1926 (silent!) and as new as 2001 (should be silent!). The acting is laughable, the direction is pure horse shiat... and that's actually being rather nice to this sorry collection. Pirates kick ass, but even the asskickery of pirates can't save this compilation of crap from being anything other than... well, crap. I can wipe my ass with a piece of film and end up with something more deserving of the classification of a ""movie"" than this tripe. Buy if you want to laugh your ass off or have the worst taste in movies."
3,It's Okay,"My six year old grandson received this for Christmas. He seemed to like it ,but it doesn't do much, the doors don't even open. Doesn't seem to be very sturdy."
4,Good Roller for Being Plastic,"I got this for my 3 yr old (almost 4)for Christmas and he loved it. He doesn't play with it very often though. He lost interest in it fairly quickly. It doesn't have too many small fragile parts on it that break as the orange snow plow does. I always like the looks of Bruder trucks, but they are not always very durable if they have small/removable parts. I do like this one though and hope my son takes more of an interest in it as he is now 5 and may be totally past liking this sort of toy now."
1,"Depressing, boring, no eggnog","This book was, simply put, pretty bad. The characters were all wooden, predictable, and boring. The plot was lacking in interest, and the men, though uniformly ""handsome"", could have been replaced by a clever cardboard-cutout for all the personality they had. I bought it expecting something passable, but honestly, I'd rather clean my bathroom than read this again. Also, pseudo-rape happening to one of the characters but her not even recognizing that fact does not win any awards in my book."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"So much for this being a ""Christmas"" book. It was basically 3 short stories involving 2 sisters and a friend. What bugged me is that each story ended abruptly. Once they found happiness it was over by the next page.The story that I disliked the most was Emma's. What she did to her seemingly wonderful boyfriend was horrible. I couldn't believe how she justified her reasons why she did what she did with her slimeball ex boyfriend.Overall, it was an OK read but not much of a light, Christmasy story."
3,Very depressing...,"I must say I was looking forward to a good Christmas book to put me in the Holiday mood but was very disappointed after the first couple of pages. I had loved Ghosts of Boyfriends past and thought this would be similiar. The first sequence of ""Jane"" was soooooo depressing, I mean she has cancer! I didnt even want to continue reading the book, but once I got past her and onto Ricki and Emma's stories I was really enjoying the story line and the atmosphere the book gives. Dont get me wrong its not a horrible book but just be prepared to break out the kleenex atleast for the first story."
3,Average Movie. Entertaining Enough...,"I really like Catherine Zeta Jones as an actress. She has a strong screen presence. She has natural elegance and effortless appeal. However, this movie fell short of being a great movie.I think that there was no real chemistry between the two leads. It could have been more but was not.However, it entertained me quite well."
3,ok,Not too bad. Surprisingly interesting with a nice twist. Good for a relaxed and mellow evening with no high expectations.
1,Sorely Disappointed,"I saw this movie in the rental store and thought since it had Catherine Zeta-Jones, it should be pretty good. How I sat through the entire movie, I will never know. I won't get into the bad acting and poor scripts or the oh-so-predicatible ending, but I will say that I was very shocked with some of the content surrounding the kids in the movie. How is it okay to shoot a scene where a mom is walking her kids to school and a bum opens his coat to display his penis to them? That's not funny, kids should not be seeing things like that, period. If the movie had even pretended to protect the kids from inappropriate situations, I might have enjoyed it better, but it's clear that the director wanted to shock audiences with what the kids could say/do/see. Overall, it was a waste of time."
1,"Not worth a dollar from Redbox, or to buy it","For someone who loves chick-flicks, this was by far the cheesiest (in a bad way) and worst acted that's come out recently. At least rent this movie before you decide on buying it or not."
1,Crude disturbing boring,"Depicts an unrealistic and odd milieu of New York characters. I could not fathom why there were such strange and disturbing associations of very young children with sexual perversion. The writer /director needs to see a therapist.Crude, unsophisticated and pedestrian movie. What a dreadful waste of. Zeta-Jones' talent.Don't waste your time watching it. Life is too short."
5,nice story,"me and my husband love this movie. He even cried. It was my first time to rent a movie in amazon and it went so quick and the movie was awesome in HD, we are happy.."
1,"terrible, had to turn it off","we could only watch 20 minutes, the screenplay is awful. there is no development, things are just thrown on the screen, and the dialog is awful. crude and offensive. very immature project."
2,Just okay,"It passes the time, but it lacked a good flow in my opinion. The end was so abrubtly back together it didn't leave you with that happy feeling like most romantic comedies."
5,"Long time Barnum fan, Instant Vitale fan!","This book is an absolute must for adding to your business library. But it's more than a book it's a marketing tool kit. If you doubt that PT's techniques apply today just read page 7, Vitale's ideas on copywriting in chapter 7 should be posted above your computer every time you attempt to write.The punch in my gut though was `the best marketing tool on earth' which you can find on page 120. I highly recommend this book no matter what type of business or service you are marketing. Read this book with pen and paper ready...you'll need them!"
5,A book of exuberant charm,"Sure, it might be a little outdated, but it's a great glimpse into a past time. And today's kids would probably enjoy the chance to do some old-fashioned things described in this book, like making their own hammock or refurbishing some old furniture. The instructions for painting and drawing and basic and useful, and many of the ideas presented are things forgotten about and could stand resurrection. Lots of attention paid to girls getting exercise and being healthy, contrary to modern perceptions of Victorian women. Good for parents and teachers, and kids who are fond of history and open to old-fashioned ideas."
3,Do Your Girl a Favor and Get her the American Boys Handy Book Instead,"My mother bought both for me as a child. I spent days going through the American Boys Handy Book but the girls version bored me to death. I was excited to learn of the amazing things boys got to do in older times but what girls were doing sounded a great deal like chores. The best bit with the American Boys Handy book is you get history and crafts together. There are many things you can still build, at least if you don't live in too urban an environment. If you do live in the city or want more female crafts than trapping, fishing and animal training, get a more modern craft book for your children. The American Girls doll company likely still makes interesting period crafts if you'd like to go the historical route. They did when my nieces were young."
4,An enjoyable romp with very little substance.,"This play is tremendously fun, one of the most enjoyable of Shakespeare's plays, (and one of the easiest to read for a modern reader) but like most of his romances, it demonstrates a roughly sixth-grade understanding of romantic love. At least in a comedy, there's some excuse for this, and it's a tradition that certainly hasn't changed in over 400 years (see: ""Shallow Hal"", for example) but in general, the characters in this play have about the depth and plausibility of, say, the Three Stooges.Read this play if you're in the mood for lighthearted Shakespearean fluff, but not if you want something with some real meaning to it. This was, in Shakespeare's time, the equivalent of ""Three's Company"" or ""Dharma & Greg"". Light entertainment for the masses, not serious literature."
3,Entertaining play,"An entertaining comedy of errors written by the perennial William Shakespeare. Not my favorite play of his, but enjoyable, like all of his other work. Simply the text of the play, expect nothing more from this version."
3,A Midsummer Night's Dream,1st play I've ever read and it was okay. The format was alittle confusing as well as the 'play' language used. Other than that it was an interesting story.
3,A Midsummer Night's Dream,"This was a pretty good book even after reading it twice. Since it is Shakespeare, it is a little tough to understand at times. The funniest part is when Puck turns Bottom's head into a donkey and Titania falls in love with him. Other than the actors in the play and the fairies, the story is not very entertaining. Even though it is a comedy, there is not very many funny parts."
4,I am not worthy to judge,"I feel sort of ridiculous being critic to the great ""bard's"" work but here I go. MsND is an enjoyable read that I was able to get through without the use of a study guide(something I have found helpful on some of his other plays). The play was not as interesting as other Shakespearean works I've read(e.g. R&J, KL, McB, but still entertaining. If rumors are true that he didn't write all that is credited to him, then this might be one he sublet to a lesser genius."
2,I love Shakespeare but,"I have never been a fan of Shakespeare comedies, I love his drama though. This play unfortunately, is a comedy and did not help to change my opinion on his comedic stylings. Not for me. I'll stick to re-re-re-reading ""Hamlet"" or ""Othello"""
1,Not good for students!,This is not the right edition for you if you are using this for a class. The Classic Edition is what you need.
1,Not Worth Our Time,"This book was too long for my liking. It was also very boring, and I struggled to keep my attention on the book. The words were too large for me to comprehend. This book make me feel like an invalid, which is not a feeling I enjoy. I would not recommend this book to a friend."
1,Horrible,I absolutely hated it. Don't really know what all the hype was about. It felt like forever trying to get through it. The end could not come fast enough! Thank God it was free because I would not have paid one red cent for it!
3,Great Story,"I should have got the modern english version, but everyone says you should read original. Well, I am not stupid, but am a regular ole guy from the South and this thing is hard to read. It's King's English for heavens sake. Guess I will memorize a line or 2 so I can quote it and sound smart."
2,Too difficult to follow,This is just too difficult to follow for me. I have a very hard time getting into a book that I cannot understand. The words are big and outdated. The writing style is long winded and over-worded. I just don't like it.
1,Comedy?,"Comedy schmodedy. If Shakespeare had meant it to be funny he would have put a joke in it. Me, I'm a fan of the Farrelly brothers. Like that bit in Dumb and Dumber when he's, like, laying this monster crap in the ski chalet. Classic. Now that's comedy."
1,This book sucks,"Say, this fictional and capricious play by Shakespear (not an original printing, you should know)is a capital reading choice. I commend you for taking the time to read and admire the Immortal Bard's wonderful work. Alliteration, huh? pretty neat."
4,"Nice fluffy play, no substance","We had to read this book for English class in ninth grade, and we really enjoyed it. Unlike many other Shakespeare plays, it was not painful to read, although the best way to absorb any and all Shakespeare is by watching it. WE thought it was fun and light-hearted, but would encourage all teachers not to have their students write essays on it, because there is not THAT much substance and it spoils the enjoyment of the book."
2,"Definitely not ""Good""","Condition stated""Good: Some visible wear, and minimal interior marks.""True ConditionFront cover and back cover are a scribbled mess. At least 50 of the 200 pages contain scribbling, notes, excessive underlining, doodling, and childlike coloring of illustrations.Over all the condition is bearable but by no means ""good."" I am very disappointed in the quality of the book and will be sure not to purchase used books from your_online_bookstore again."
1,Loved it so much,I loved this book mainly because Shakespeare wrote it and because it was a good story. I have always loved anything by him.
4,great but no line numbers,"A good cheap way to read the classics, and I buy these so that I don't write in my larger Norton Shakespeare (so I can return it, LOL). I don't feel bad trashing these with notes and dogears.But, there are no line numbers for references, so to do that I have to refer to another edition.These are great however, and usually available in the 4 for 3 promotion.The play itself? Classic!"
4,Play - Shakepeare - A Midsummer Night's Dream,No issues. This was a free product. I read it before I listed to an audio drama version. It could be better edited but it was free.
3,Very difficult to follow,"I really like Shakespeare, however this particular version of this book is a hard read. I would recommend a different copy."
3,"the lilys sky, aspera just lie there","4 very classically lilys-sounding lilys tracks--no bad thing. but not classic lilys.for the completist, for the most part. but if you are like me you have to have it all!aspera are really sleepy in a not interesting way.other bands to investigate in this post MBV vein: Idaho, the black watch, swirlies..."
3,"lilys are great, aspera ad astra is boring","The Lilys have always been a great band. This record is no exception. If you like shoegaze/dreampop stuff, you'll definitely dig the lilys.The AAA songs, however, are very slow and boring. There is an element of the Flaming Lips here, but hardly the energy the lips have. It is just very drab and very boring. However, I will say that their tour EP that insound put out is well worth getting...it is really good...these tracks just didn't live up to what I hoped they would be."
4,Seashells + Counting + Rhyme = Super,"Seashells by the Seashore incorporates many important and different themes that children may enjoy: counting, rhyming, collecting shells, sharing a hobby with a grandparent, multicultural friendship, and care of the earth. The addition on each page of a new shell enhances the book. The explanation of each shell , as well as, general introduction to collecting shells is also welcome. The artwork compliments the story beautifully. A fun book that could be used successfully in a Story Tim and/or with an individual child.Julienne Marks, Youth Services Librarian"
4,"Review of ""Seashells by the Seashore""","Marianne Berkes has created a delightful work of ""faction"" for young readers and listeners. Sue collects seashells as a gift for her grandmother. Using rhyming prose, twelve different shells are named, described and pictured. Information about the formation of the shells by sea animals is included as the reader counts from one to twelve.Ms. Berkes visited my school recently and spoke, read and sang to students from pre-kindergarten 3-year-olds to third graders. She is a wonderful and energetic presenter! Amoung her many props were the actual shells mentioned in the book. Her presentation was lively and fun for all and students were totally engaged. Each group was left wanting to spend more time with her. We will be anxious to have her return when her next book is released."
3,"Want to love it, but...","the knob on the winch broke the first day we gave it to our 4 year old. You can't operate the winch without it! Luckily, Bruder sells 2 replacement winches and we have ordered one that did not come with our truck in the hope that it will be a bit more durable. The truck is also a bit bigger than I would have anticipated for a 1/16 size. Our little guy was really excited about this truck, so we look forward to its speedy repair."
3,Son loves but broke apart :(,"My son's (3.5) best buddy had this toy and so he was dying to get one. We gave it to him for Christmas and within a week the wench off of front had come off (our friend had same complaint) plus the rear wheels on axel broke off. Both could possibly be fixed with a glue gun or something (they pop back into place temporarily) but disappointed to even need it. Had heard the rave reviews of Bruder's quality and how it was worth the extra price. My son loved it I'll reiterate, but be prepared to keep putting it back together :("
1,Very disappointing,Thought this would be the highlight gift for my 4 year old grandson. The Winch won't work...and that was meant to be the best part.
1,Breaks easily,"I got this truck for my son's second birthday. He broke it within two weeks, the front wheels came right off. I was pretty disappointed. Also, the winch is hard to use and doesn't work very well or stay on tightly."
3,"Okay for the price, could be more durable","My son has the crane truck by Bruder so we bought him this one as well. It does not seem to be as durable and sturdy as the crane. The bed is a little flimsy and the tailgate is pretty thin and appears that it could break easily. The hook on front is great and the winding mechanism seems to be fine. I really want to like Bruder and we were satisfied with the crane but I'm not sure if we will buy anymore at this point. The are a little pricey and my son loves basic push around trucks which is why we went with Bruder. He doesn't care for the button sounds and electronic movements and all of that fancy stuff. I hope this one holds up. Just a follow up on this review, this has become one of my suns favorite toys now. It does seem to be holding up well and my initial worries have been eased. I would recommend this truck and so far the Bruder truck line as a whole."
1,Terrible Value,"I am actually a huge fan of Canon optics. When I first started searching for a DV camcorder, I looked at Canons. Then I realized that Canon does not know how to make a quality camcorder. The ZR series (all of them) suffer from tremendously bad audio, and the MC200 is a worse model than the MC100. Actually the MC100 was probably the best DV camera that Canon ever made, and it just so happens to be the one that is discontinued. Since I am so fond of Canon photo equiptment, I wrote this review hoping that Canon would hear it's consumers cries, and fix thier awful camcorder problems.Do yourself a favor and stick with a Sony or Panasonic. They each offer solid audio, video, and features."
1,Terrible Product!,"My husband and I paid 70$ for this phone and it is the worst investment we have ever had! Even though it has several channels to change from, there is still severe crackling and you can not hear the caller very well. I am ready to throw the darn thing out the window, but because it's my only phone, I have to live with it until we get a new one. The first month with it was ok then it started in with the static and crackling. I would never recommend this phone!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This is the worst cordless/speaker phone that I have ever owned. It was tough getting the handset to sit just right in the cradle so that the handset would charge. Battery life was the pits. Bought another battery thinking that would make a difference. It didn't and was just a further waste of cash. The unit is now just a paperweight on my desk. If you just need a speaker phone, it will work fine but I bet you could find something better for less."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!,"This is a illustration book of the anime chara's of Kaikan Phrase. Sakuya is the vocal and of course on the cover. This photo book contains a Special Interview with Mayu Shinjo and Lucifer (the real band), all color art pages, big poster inside, 4 postcards of HOTTIE Sakuya 2001 kaikan Phrase special calendar and a scene secret selection (from the manga). This book is well worth the price, if you like Kaikan Phrase XD"
5,Everything it's cracked up to be.,I purchased this sprocket to drop a tooth on my 2011 ZX10R and this has all the makings of a long-lasting sprocket. Good steel construction with a slightly thinner center and holes tapped around it to further reduce weight. It was a perfect fit and at a good price for the benefit and quality this sprocket provides.
1,Jason is correct 100% this phone is junk,I have used many cordless phones and concur with Jason 100%.This is a phone to stay away from.I still have this POS and am tossing it and moving on to a higher end Panasonic.
1,Pure Junk,"I bought this phone because we owned an old SW Bell Cordless Answering machine and liked it a lot. No More. The hardware is a continuous aggrevation (loses power, noisy, bad volume control) and customer service blames me for all problems. It has gone into the trash - and I have gone to panasonic."
3,Ok phone for the money,"This phone works, but it is just ok for the money. There are better priced phones with more features on the market."
2,Disappointing,"We bought this phone because we needed a phone and answering machine quick. I should have shopped a little more. The display is EXTREMELY difficult to read. It works the opposite of my old phone causing me to hang up on people when I don't intend to, and answer calls I intend the machine to take. I'd like to return it to the Target store where I purchased it. The reception is poor and it has no volume control on the headset."
2,I'M SOOOO DIZZY!,I bought this product so my children would get a bit of a religious education. Churches are way too biased. The concept was way cool but the execution was terrible. Most cut scenes were implemented with a spinning sky or something similar. Had to stop watching it after only 1 hour. Producer/Director needs to lighten up on the uneccesary effects. I would NOT BUY this.
3,Cursory Look Into His Life and Times,"Nice, Readers' Digest look into the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth, with some surprisingly complex reenactments. As a historical fictin writer who has placed several books in that milieu, I was pleased to see all the ways the producers of this film got the details right, from the terra cotta olive oil candles to the carpentry shop. Everything feels as it should, and much more than that, this is not a heavy-handed missionary tract, but rather a simple retelling (in cursory strokes) of the life of Yeshua bar Josef. Enjoyable, if lightweight, and especially appropriate for younger viewers."
1,You get what you pay for.,This tool worked well for about 30 bulbs and then spring handle broke and metal side bent. I have arthritis in both hands so I was initially please with my ability to use this tool. Unfortunately it broke that first day. I can't squeeze very hard so it certainly wasn't roughly used. OK if you don't mind a disposable tool and don't have too much to plant.
1,Great Design But Metal Too Weak,In anything but the softest soil with no roots or wee stones the gauge metal is too thin / weak and the handles bend > as pointed out in other reviews.
3,Okay for the money,"This is sturdy but works just about as well as it should for the money. Perhaps a more costly one would work a little smoother/easier, but this gets the job done. Planted over 300 bulbs in about 90 minutes with it (scattered throughout an acre)."
1,Junk,"This is a nice idea but very very flimsy. It will work great if your soil is so loose that you don't have to apply any force, and you have no roots. Otherwise, good for about 10 bulbs."
2,Side bent with first use,"This product has a clever design. Push it into the soil, use the markings on the side to determine depth, place the bulb in the hole and squeeze the handle together to open the bottom and release the dirt. It worked great when the soil was soft. However, I have clay soil. Pushing and twisting at the same time helped to get through the soil, until the metal side collapsed. I straightened the metal side several times, and tried to be gentle with it, but it collapsed over and over again. It would be a wonderful product if it was made of more sturdy materials, but as is, it doesn't seem to hold up to tough soil."
4,Relationship rescue,I enjoyed this book. Relationships are important and in reality if you have everything but don't have love -- you've got nothing. This book offers a great starting place.
3,so cute but shorts don't stay put,"I have always wanted this skirt and waited and waited until it was available and when it finally was I was in heaven! In my house. When I actually go for a run, the under compression short slips up my thighs. I have found this a problem with new balance in general, even thier running shorts do this on me. I thought I may have the wrong size. I wear 8 pants and 6 skirts, but I checked the retailer's sizing guide and it guided me to size M. I don't have a small bottom....... I usually run about 5 miles and I must stop at least 3 times to adjust. That being said I love the way I look in it and feel so feminine. It's about time runners can look sassy......."
1,Waste of money!,"This book is just as bad as the actual book it tries to help you with. The examples are confusing, and they rarely include the actual problems that are in the book. You are stuck with the same problems that forced you to buy this parent guide in the first place. Save your money, and tell your school to get the idea and switch to normal system that is at least understandable, not like this garbage."
1,Math Unexplained,"Our son suffered through algebra under this textbook and I see nothing but trouble with geometry as well. These authors are trying to pack entirely too much information into an unattractive package that should be thrown out with yesterday's garbage.The frustrated parent from Alta Loma, which is near where we live, is correct. There are far better algebra and geometry books on the market, but God forbid that Alta Loma or Etiwanda High teachers will take the time and trouble to look for them.These books are tough to plow through, too densely packed with information and a prime reason why the ""standards"" movement will ultimately fail. Phooey on it all, but particularly on this book."
5,Perfect for outdoor runners,"I run in the early evenings and bought this jacket for outdoor, road running in the fall and winter when it's dark outside at the end of the day. It's ideal! Thin and lightweight enough to wear as a single layer over my togs when it's still relatively warm out in the fall, but roomy enough to layer over t-shirts and a fleece pullover when it gets icy out there. It also closes securely with both a zipper and velcro tabs at the hips and collar.The best thing about it is the reflective piping and white stripes. I feel much more confident running in black when I know these parts of my attire are clearly visible. I wear it every time I run in the dark, it's now part of my standard ""uniform"". It machine washes nicely (I let it air dry) and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another when this one wears out.I haven't had to hear another driver tell me, ""I almost didn't see you running out there, be careful!"" since I started wearing it months ago."

1,No comment.,"This is really stupid. Don't buy it. I got it from the library and thought it would have actual music in it, but instead there's some guy raving about how rock stars are evil. I suppose you could conclude something from that, but I don't think rock stars are possessed by demons."
3,Mature Spidey,"I realize this is a PG 13 movie but the first two, after screening, have been seen by my 7 yr old as they were clean and void of obscene language. This one is more mature, has more sexual content (mild but there) and more bad language that our TV Guardian did not 'bleep' out. It seems these movies are geared toward the under 13 crowd with a PG 13 rating and it's annoying. Most kids over 13 could care less about Spiderman."
1,Alan G. Barbour's book not worth reading,"Alan G. Barbour's book not worth readingAlan G. Barbour is no friend to the Lyme patient. I suffer from chronic Lyme disease and was terribly disappointed and angered by this book. There was a pervasive, underlying thread which downplayed the number of Lyme cases, the severity of the disease, and the complexity of the disease. Barbour's disregard for the plight of Lyme patients is demonstrated in his inexcusable lack of treatment guidelines besides a cookbook reliance on a short term antibiotic therapy which has been clinically proven wrong for many patients. Many, many people are suffering with Lyme disease and cannot get proper treatment. If you buy this book, you will be, in my opinion, adding to this suffering. You will also be less informed when you have finished this book than before you began. Please don't add credibility to Barbour as a Lyme disease expert by buying this book."
1,Information is not helpful; controversy is not explained,"This book will only confuse you if you are looking for real answers to the Lyme disease controversy or help for an undiagnosed illness. Barbour does not give you enough information to make informed decisions regarding treatment or diagnosis of an actual entrenched and untreated case of Lyme disease. Your money will be better spent buying books by Denise Lang, Karen Forschner, or Polly Murray."
1,not pleased,"As a lyme disease patient, I scoured the book looking for help with the symptoms that I have dealt with on a daily basis for 5 yrs now. I found no reference to any of these symptoms in this book, nothing to help me cope with the disease that Dr. Barbour says can be cured with a quick dose of antibiotics. Do yourself a favor, skip this book. More information can be found in a few minutes on the internet."
1,"Condescending, arrogant and narrow-minded look at Lyme.","Barbour cleverly reviews some of the literature, dismisses entirely or denigrates what doesn't support his hypotheses, and ignores clinical and patient experience to paint a very narrow view of what Lyme is and is not in his eyes. The insensitivity displayed towards patients is only driven home by his patronizing condescension. Patient overviews not only appear oversimple, but faked.Barbour doesn't seem to understand that his academic posturing may intimidate his colleagues into buying his ideas, but doesn't necessarily work when trying to sell his ideas to the thinking public.A book that leaves you snowed, slapped and spitting. And very glad the author is not your doctor.Rita L. Stanley, Ph.D"
1,Really lame,"I bought this thinking it was going to be video - it's animation.It only cost a few bucks, but isn't worth even that to me. I watched it through once. Felt like I was watching a cartoon that was trying to hypnotize me (unsuccessfully).Just my opinion, of course."
4,"Good cast, good plot, interesting",It kept me interested with a good story and good acting.More than I can say for most movies.Brian
5,This book is absolutely necessary if you have ESL students.,I have taught ESL in grades K-12 for four years. This book has been by my side the whole time. It has tons of helpful information and blackline masters to use with beginning students of English. It is also a wonderful resource to share with regular ed. teachers who have questions about dealing with their ESL students.
1,Outdated and useless,"I own an English language school in Japan and this book is utterly useless. It might be of some use to you if your idea of teaching is to photocopy boring worksheets and pray that nobody notices. This book is a waste of money. There is nothing of value to any trained professional. (...) I bought several of her books and regret each purchase. In my situation, I need to not only teach the English language, but make it interesting and fun since that is what the parents of my students are paying for. Results. (...)"
1,"Not much of a ""survival"" kit","If I could return this book, I would.The lessons are not very good. Search the net and you will find much better.The copyable pages are not very good. You can make better with your pc and cheap printer.It gives you a lot of ideas for other books to buy. Save your money and google ""ESL Lessons"" +kids. After your search you will have enough useful free teaching material and ideas to fill several books."
1,You get what you pay for...,I revert to my walgreens $5 phone for important calls because the sound quality is better. Make sure you realize the phone is NOT call-waiting ID ready. Or better yet.. spend more onb something decent.
3,Why should my dogs eat better than I do?,"Seriously, this book gives quite a bit of nutritional information, but it seems that the recipes are overly done for the person who just wants to give his dogs an alternative to commercial food. I find the thought of cooking a rather complicated recipe each day (or week) to be daunting. Also, though my dogs are usually anything but finicky, they have turned up their noses at several of the offerings."
3,Not as good as others about the same subject,"I guess I wanted my scientific and nutritional knowledge in a dog recipe book. This book is just too joky, with no real facts to back anything up."
1,I found this book to be useless - it has no serving sizes!,"Ok, it is April 2007 and it seems like most of the foods you buy your dog at the store will kill the dog dead. Scary stuff! So I think to myself, ""I have a small dog (Pomeranian - 8 lbs) and I'll just cook him some food each week and not worry about whether I'm poisoning him with melamine.""Except this book has a lot more holistic hogwash than good solid recipes for dogs. But the thing that makes it utterly useless is the lack of caloric information and serving sizes for your dog based on weight.By golly, they'll tell you that your Chow Chow needs a high fiber diet, but they won't tell you how many cups to feed your dog for a proper amount of calories each day.Canine obesity runs rampant right now, and not all dogs eat the correct amount without the owner rationing the food in the proper quantities. So this book is virtually useless for preparing meals for your dog."
5,Great solution,I was stuck with no diagnosis for my dog that kept throwing up dog food. A trial of 2 weeks would go by and my dog would be in the ER. After this book I was able to keep my dog completely healthy. Without this book I don't know what I would have done. There is a lot of information you can listen to or not but take it for what it is... a dog can eat human food with proper combinations of foods. My other dog does eat dog food. This is a great solution for a dog with digestive problems.
2,Not worth the money,This book is ok...you can come up with better recipes on your own tho. This is not worth buying.
1,Don't Feed Grains to A Canine!,"Books like this are well intentioned but totally off the mark. Dogs would *never* eat grains in the wild and cancer cells feed on grains. Take it from a dog owners who's precious pet has been on a life long home made diet which included grains, who's precious baby is showing multiple cancers at age 7. Do not feed grains to dogs."
5,Do your pet a kindness and get this book,"I found out about this book from a holistic veterinarian. This is such a wonderful book, I have purchased now 5 copies as gifts for friends. The recipes are easy, wholesome, and my dog's digestion (previously a problem requiring numerous visits to the regular vet and monster doses of antibiotics) has been excellent ever since she's been eating this food, which she loves. I have recommended the book especially for people whose dogs have challenges, such as cancer, heart trouble, or arthritis. But even for perfectly healthy dogs, this is a terrific book."
2,"Not For All, Watch Recipes For Toxic Ingredients","There is some very good nutritional information in the first half of the book - which gets a little long. However, at least one recipe calls for raisins which, along with grapes, avocados, garlic, macadamia nuts, as well as the more commonly known toxins such as chocolate and antifreeze, are toxic to dogs so use caution and good common sense.Not practical for a medium or larger dog. It's probably okay if you have a smaller dog and have a lot of time to prepare a meal. It takes plenty of time and a lot of planning.I found it very pricey to prepare a meal for my pet. I started with the transition/cleansing diet, which is to be fed for 7 days. After 2 days, she took one sniff, gave me a disgusted look and walked away refusing to eat. I would suggest a high quality organic food instead as there is no way you can get all the daily nutrition your pet needs by cooking for them."
5,Good surf vid,A little over the top in terms of trying to be artistic ... but an excellent surf video in general.
5,awesome,awesome a must see!!!!!!!! spoon horse bat can gnarly hair mars day pet rope ear red day yes swoop poop pot that ring gang
3,"good, bad, and cheezzzz","The surfing in this movie was legit. Quality. Nice wives and plenty of big airs and that good stuff, well pleased. Only complaint is all the other crap between surfing. The intro is hella cheezy, literally a cheezy light pyramid and they're all gathering around it. It sounds funny but its meant to be serious in the film. This sort of cheezyness continues throughout surf segments. Got to be bothersome. The other thing i didnt like was that you maybe hear a total of 7 words from the actual surfers the whole time. It's like 6 dudes (cant remember how many exactly) flying around the world to some sick, exotic looking locations, and not a peep. I could keep going but i dont want to get too subjective. I would try n get this dvd cheap or just do the instant download for $8 or something. Its definitely worth watching for the surf alone but the $20 plus i have seen for it, not so much."
4,A solid product,"The sound quality is great. Paul's voice is smooth as silk. The video image is good but at times amateurish. The song selection is good. Not too up-tempo, which should satisfy those like me who enjoy having concert DVDs as background but not the centerpiece of their living room. It does not compare to a Diana Krall Live in Paris in meeting that requirement, however.I like when concert DVDs offer subtitles to follow the words, but this DVD does not offer them. But this is definitely a worthwhile purchase."
4,Carrack is great. This DVD may be for fans only.,"I generally agree with the other reviews though I can't see why anyone would want the lyrics on the screen I would find that annoying. I also am not quite sure what was meant by the comaprison to the Diana Krall DVD (a pure jazz artist). On the other hand I do like this DVD. I am a big Carrack fan and these performances are well recorded.I do have one small complaint; I think the stage could have used more light. The video tends to feel a little ""dark"" in that spotlights are often used rather brighter stage lighting to highlight the whole band and stage. Still this is a small personal complaint. Some people find this more intimate. Either way the music is exceptional and Paul is in great voice. As usual with these kinds of videos I have a few personal favorites I wish he had done here but that's a fan talking."
2,"Amazon streaming very ""fuzzy""","We have Netflix and watch all the time and it is clear. I have tried to watch Amazon a couple oftimes, but not good quality."
5,Ponti: Italiano terzo millenio (with Audio CD),"This was exactly the textbook I needed for my intermediate italian class. It was an immediate delivery and it was in excellent condition; plus, when I e-mailed the owner of the store, they answered almost immediately. What I loved most was the price; I paid half of what I would have had I bought the book elsewhere; as a college student, this is probably one of the most important things. All in all, this person's doing great."
2,short life quality,"We purchased 2 sets of these and the caller ID screens have gone out on 3 out of 4 units after 6 months. The sound quality on 1 is distant and faded, and on another it has a severe echo. Disappointed with the life and quality of the product for the money spent."
2,Don't Buy This Phone!,"Almost since the beginning this phone would beep ocassionally during a call, to the person I was calling, and just sort of go quiet on my end. I called Southwestern Bell and they were not helpful, except to say to send it in. Which I refused to do. From other reviews, it seems this is a defect of the phone. The screen also went blank after a year or so, like other reviewers have mentioned. I just got phone service that includes Caller ID and can't even see the number. I am now shopping for a new phone."
2,"Good, until...","I've had this phone system for just over 1 year (just out of warranty, naturally). It worked pretty well, with good sound and range. The answering machine was above average and had good features. Handset only holds 30 phone numbers in memory - which is very limiting for me. Now, for the really bad news --- A few weeks ago, I noticed the LCD screen characters on one of the handsets was starting to disappear. A few days later the other handset started doing the same. Now, just a few weeks later, both LCD screens are totally illegible. I have not dropped or misused these phones, so what's up SWBell? I won't be buying another Bell phone after this experience."
3,You can do better,"The orchestra performance is good, though nothing spectacular like Solti's. When it comes to the cast, however, it seems that some singers really tried very hard to turn you off Wagner.The hardest-working off-putter is Windgasser, whose awful German enunciation makes one wonder whether his last name is an alias. It sounds like his mouth is filled with liquid-gold saliva all the time: heavy as gold, yet still saliva. Laborious, pretentious, and most unnatural. Nilsson, as usual, could not be too bad even if she meant to. But you get a better Elizabeth or Venus from Ludwig/Dernesh. She also shows an enunciation problem, even if it's nothing like Windgasser's.It is a duty, not pleasure, to sit through this performance. If this is your first Tannhauser, I urge you to go for Leinsdorf, Sinopoli or Solti. If you already have all three, you then can afford the luxury of this set, if only for a laugh."
5,This book is a comprehensive source of holocaust information,"This book is perhaps the most comprehensive book on the concentration camp system. It offers insight into the make up each and every individual camp including the ghastly actions that took place inside the camps. Konnilyn Feig has done extensive research on this subject and should be regarded as one of the world's leading authorities on the holocaust and final solution. This book is a necessity for anyone trying to comprehend the madness that took place in Nazi Germany. It gives names, dates and places along with instructions on how to get to each of the camps. This book should be read before visiting any of the holocaust camps and/or museums. ""Hitler's Death Camps"" is currently in the National Holocaust museum. Anyone wanting to know anything about the holocaust and/or final solution needs to read this book."
3,Important work on the Holocaust but at times historically inaccurate,"A must read for anyone wanting to learn about the Holocaust, however some of the ""facts"" in the work are simply wrong. The author claims that 4 million! people were killed in Auschwitz. This is simply not true. If one researches the many sources available today, it is proven that an estimated 1 million people were murdered there. I recently went to a museum (TMOT) in Los Angeles and one of the guides claimed that 10 million Jews were killed by the Nazi's which is also untrue. It was about 6 million. Undoubtedly the Holocaust is the worst crime that has been committed in history but I don't understand why this numbers are ""made up"" by certain people. 6 million people murdered is terrifying enough, so why the need to exaggerate about the numbers? In any case, Dr. Feig's work provides a disturbing account to what happened in these murder factories and is an invaluable source on the Nazi concentration camps and what happened there."
5,A Unique Reading Experience,"Konnilyn Feig's engrossing journey into our not so distant past is an incredible encounter with the depths of human suffering and ultimately, the strength of humanity. A fastidious chronicle of Hitler's evil plans in action, ""Hitler's Death Camps"" is brutally honest in conveying the scope of the Holocaust's devastation. For an uninitiated reader of WWII suffering, Feig's book will be shocking but compelling. It is a needed text to fully comprehend what can happen to a society in the hands of hatred and moral dereliction. If you want to know what really occurred in the Holocaust, the reading of ""Hitler's Death Camps"" is mandatory"
5,Chilling in its completeness.,"For those interested in learning about the holocaust, Hitler's Death Camps is the best choice. It gives the reader a picture of the holocaust as a whole. The author does not get bogged down in detail, but rather gives the reader a broad perspective, from the T4 experiments to the Allied liberation. A great source of information that's easy to read."
3,An anecdotal remembrance of life in a Andalusian village,"This work is more an anecdotal remembrance than a seamless flowing memoir. I wouldn't recommend this book as a first book about Spain, but I do think it is valuable for its knowledge about small Andalusia pueblo life in the twenties. In this it is very well written. The author is at his best describing the life, social mores and incredible natural panorama of the Sierra Nevada. I found the chapters dealing with his various visitors (English intellectual figures) uninteresting. I'll speculate that when it was published in the 50's that this was probably of more interest- now, with the exception of Virginia Woolf, these individuals are dimly remembered personages."
1,Waxworks 2 No thanks.,"I remember seeing Waxwork as a kid and I liked it then and like it somewhat now,it is lacking in many things but fun in others,Part 2 I didn't see until now And It seems a bigger spoof and less entertaining,Overall 2 Corny Movies, but the Sequel Is the Worst."
4,Good and cheesy,"A cheesy sequel that is well worth the rental or paying of this film. Firstly, we find the characters where they were from the previous film and things then everything starts to go from bad to worse. Secondly, a common rich boy becomes a man of high class society in medival times. FInally, we find that our two main characters talk to each other over the space of time. Then in the end we find our hero's success and once again reunited through love and time."
2,a review,Picks up where the 1st one left off. Deborah Foreman's character from the original is replaced with actress Monika Schnarre. A rehash of the 1st which was a lot better. Look for Drew Barrymore's cameo.
1,Ok the first 2 uses,"After the first 2 uses the teeth wont lock in place, they seem stripped out but the teeth look to be in good shape. Won't lock where we need it. Disappointing."
5,Get a head start on QFD,Excellent. Has guided me to implement QFD at work. It is easy to read and understand. Material sometimes is condensed but worth reading. It is a good beginning for those interested in applying QFD.
5,shiny,"This gives a nice shine for a yorkie coat. I use it between washes to keep her coat looking shiny. Too much of it makes her look greasy, so just a little of the product works best."
5,Works very well and smell isn't over-powering,I bought this to use on my Maltese. It works very well as a detangler and he doesn't smell overly perfuming after I use it. It does make him shiny and bit a slippery until it soaks in. That's to be expected though I guess.
2,Not as effective as I needed,"I have a morkie with silky hair that mats. This product had little to no effect on her tangles, can't see any difference in the shine. Overall a waste of money"
2,What the gosh dern heck is this guy talking about?,"I bought the book on impulse... the title caught my eye, the first story was very interesting, AND the book was small enough to fit neatly into my tote bag...Big Mistake. I loved the first story,( the one about the family that had a child die in the snow and wasn't found until spring) second story I thought was odd but finished it anyway. Third story I was saying ""whattt is he is talking about? didn't finish that one... fourth up struggled through that one. Fifth story, again I just couldn't make head nor tails about it.After that, feeling very let down and disapointed I put it away. I went back to my local INDEPENDENT book store, threw myself at their mercy and they let me return it. PHEW!"
1,THE WORST PHONE EVER!,"Please don't buy this phone unless you have nothing else to do but waste money. I got the phone at a really great price so I can't be too mad. The phone has terrible reception, and the battery dies too fast. I took the phone back after 2 days of using it. This was the worst phone that I have ever used!"
1,Great as a Dust collector!,"The only thing good I can say about this phone is the color. Nothing but static. There is a high pitched noise every few minutes while your on the phone, for no reason. Even on high for the volume control- you can barely hear a person and the buttons are so sensitve that you easily hang up on people if your check hits one of them!"
1,AWFUL PHONE,"The reception is horrible, the range is not even close to the manufacturer's claims, and it cuts in and out constantly. We have three other cordless phones in our home and we don't have the same problems. This phone is definitely a dud! Don't buy it or you'll be online shopping for another (just like I am today!!)BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Do not waste your money,"I purchased this phone with the desire to get a reasonably priced cordless phone, with caller ID and without an answering machine. Not too many phones fit this catagory. I figured the 900 MHz was the way to go. After using this phone for two weeks I went back to the 15 year old corded desk phone and gave this thing to Goodwill. The reception was so bad, I could not hear half of what the other person was saying. Plus there was an echo whenever I spoke. Very annoying. Needless to say, it was a complete waste of my money."
2,Disappointing Overall,"I purchased this phone to replace an older ATT cordless phone and was disappointed with almost very aspect. The design is neither attractive nor comfortable in the hand, set up is quirky, documentation is unclear, and day-to-day performance is disappointing. Although fairly comfortable with all sorts of electronic devices, I had to call the help line to complete set up, which required a series of steps not described in the documentation.Overall, a disappointment."
2,This book is kinda misleading...,"I bought this book thinking that it would give me in-depth New Yorkers' view of New York City--like the neat neighborhood to shop, mom & pop's restaurants to eat, or some off-the-wall places to stay. Instead, it's just a typical generic guidebook that tells you same old thing, such as Louis Vuitton is the place to buy leather wallet. Well duh, I knew that! I could go to a local mall in my area and find a Louis Vuitton store. I wanna know the little hidden place that the experienced NY Times staff would know since, you guess it, they live in NYC."
3,Scoutmaster's other handbook,I should have done more research on the content of this book. It wasn't what I was looking for.
5,Must have for every Scoutmaster,This book is incredible. All of the things you have always wanted to know and didn't really want to learn the hard way. Mark Ray tells it the way it should be told. I have used this book numerous times already and have only had it about a month. His thoughtful and sometimes painful insights are exactly what those in charge or working with a Scout Troop need to hear.
4,Great read and very helpful.,This book was a great help. Well written with lots of good ideas and sources to find even more. Mark has a great writing style.
1,Don't waste your money,This band was terrible in the 80's and has only matured into old men still playing the crappy music from 20+ years ago. No talent wanna-be's from BFE.
1,This book sucks!,No information and the info that is provided is inaccurate. Ithink the author should know what they are talking about when they write about something.
5,Excellent Book but I'd Recommend Buying it from A Different Vendor,"The book itself is excellent. Wolf Kahn writes beautifully and I love to hear what he thinks about his art -- this is so helpful to me as an artist struggling with many of the same issues in my own work. However, this is the SECOND book I've purchased from Amazon recently that was clearly USED (pages bent, cover scuffed & torn)when I purchased what was supposed to be a NEW book. This is inexcusable. I don't have the time to repackage and return it, so I just accepted it, but I am so dissapointed in Amazon. Had I chosed to purchase a used book I would have saved a lot of money and it would have been in the same (or better) condition."
2,"Cocoa good, product packing AWFUL!","This powder is actually very good and this would be a 4 star item if it wasn't for the product packaging. The 3 boxes arrived in a plastic bag and there was so much powder loose that I thought a box had broken and the bag torn open. Not the case, the cocoa is just in the boxes and not in a bag in the box. The cardboard box is flimsy and the edges are not sealed. What a waste of good product! I couldn't figure out the best was to store it because every time I touched the box it would poof out and make a mess. I ended up having to buy a separate container to store it."
3,Droste Processed Cocoa Powder,"I recall using this product in 1956, and I liked it very much then. Over the decades I had not used it, until I recently bought several boxes on Amazon.com.The cocoa powder is excellent and makes a delicious and easy-to-make hot chocolate drink. But I was very disappointed with the packaging. The powder was in a box without a bag or a sealed lid. Consequently it leaked and it was a mess. I gave one box as a gift and had to seal it in a sealed small freezer bag before gift wrapping it.Droste could do better on the packaging. Hershey does.I rate the cocoa powder 5 stars and I rate the packaging 1 star. Therefore and overall, I rate Droste's Dutch Processed Cocoa 3 stars.Steve Riehle"
2,Not Up to Standards,"I found this DVD of Roy Orbison performances to be a disappointment. I am a big fan of his music, but I enjoy having his singing supported by the full orchestrations of the original hits. Too often this was not the case on the videos. I did enjoy the video with k.d. lang on Crying. It is the best part of the entire selection of performances."
5,The Great RoY Orbison DVD (greatest hits),"I ordered this DVD from Amazon purely because of my own love for Roy Orbison's music and the videos I had seen of him. Plus, the price was great.When I told some co-workers about it they had to borrow it. One in fact watched it and went ahead and ordered one for herself from Amazon.I myself can watch it over and over again. One reason for that is I sing Karoake and do a few of his songs. Very difficult, because no one can sing him.My only regret is that I cannot listen to the audio of it in my car CD player."
5,Adds another player to great game!,"St petersburg is a great game, and if you like it, then buying this will be worth it to add one more friend to the game."
3,Over Sized for Regular Electric RC Heli,Too Big and heavy for my electric RC helicopters. It is designed for large nitro RC helicopters ONLY.
2,Hard to hear...,I do not like this phone. The option selections are not very intuitive. The volume on the headset seems to go down every time you hang up the phone. The next time you answer you have to turn it back up to hear the caller.
4,"Works Well, Smells Not-So-Great","In my quest to use natural beauty products, I have settled on this conditioner as my regular one. Good Points:1) Free of Sodium Lauryl/Laureth Sulfates2) Paraben AND Pthalate-Free (Hard to Find This!)3) No residue on my hair - I have very fine hair, and this doesn't leave it feeling weighed down or greasyBad Points1) The smell. It is not really pleasant, and borders on being unpleasant. This is the area I can tell the biggest difference between regular brands and natural brands...but it's a smart sacrifice to purchase something that is healthier for me and the environment."
2,Does Not Condition,"I bought this conditioner (and it's matching shampoo) a few months ago because they were on clearance at Target. I just started using it. However, my hair is SO dry. I decided to stick it out and see if it got better. My hair does look clean for longer than most shampoo/conditions I've used. However, my hair is tangly and dry all the time, including immediately after I get out of the shower. I would not recommend this product. It HURTS to brush my hair and I feel like the damage it is doing to my hair with how hard and dry it has become cannot be outweighed by the fact that it is natural. It does seem like my hair has more body, but I would take soft hair over dry-body any day.Just for info: I have fine, straight hair. It has never been dry, although every once in awhile it can get oily. It might be better suited for other hair types."
5,Fantastic!,Please see my review for the matching shampoo-also fantastic! I would buy this for the scent alone: It's a fresh burst of sweet grapefuit. It also works beautifully!
3,"Good, but I don't think I'll buy it again.","I recently bought this conditioner, and I'm sad to say I'm disappointed. I had used it before with good results, so I had high expectations. It didn't meet them. It didn't make my hair very shiny. It did make my hair soft and manageable, but I was hoping for lots of shine. Also, there's the smell. It's not a bad smell. It's not unpleasant. It's actually kind of nice. I just don't want my hair to smell like that. The smell clashes with other scented products I use, and I don't want that. I would much prefer a nice floral smell, or unscented."
1,"I guess if you want to smell like a dirty hippie, go for it...","I bought this product because my skin has become very sensitive over the years, probably due to all the junk I used to put in it. I now have to be much more careful about the products I buy. Usually I use either Naturelle or Organix products, and I haven't had any problems with those. However, I decided to give this a try because it was readily available, and I was almost running out of my usual.Big mistake. This stuff smells HORRIBLE. I would not recommend it unless you prefer coming out of the shower smelling worse than when you went in!"
3,"Decent, some problems","The main thing that comes to mind when i think about this camera is the rate at which the batteries wear out, it is a real compromise. The quality is nothing more than decent. It's fine for use for work or something, nothing more."
1,NOT WHAT EXPECTED,PICTURE QUALITY IS AWFUL. BATTERY RUNS OUT QUICK AND I HAVE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES...TAKES TOO LONG TO TAKE THE PICTURE..KEEPING IN MIND THAT I OWN ANOTHER DIGITAL CAMERAS(KODAK WHICH WAS A GIFT IT IS THE BEST I HAD YET)THIS ONE WAS FOR MY JOB AND ITS JUNK...
2,I went through two of these...,"I tried this out in the store and was impressed by how easy it was to figure out the basic operations without a manual. It takes good pictures for general use, such as EBay or viewing on computer. The price and styling are also attractive.There seem to be quality problems. The first one I bought had problems with the macro lens setting. It quit working! The second one had a bad LCD right out of the box (illegible bands across the screen). I noticed the demos in the stores had broken macro switches as well. This model is made in China. The 200, the next model up, is made in Taiwan."
2,Abysmal picture quality at full resolution,"I bought this looking for a cheap camera to put up pictures on the web. 1.3MP (1280x960) should be more than enough for that. However, in 1.3MP mode, this camera takes awful blotchy photos. I suspect this camera's CCD actually uses far less than 1.3MP and interpolates up to that resolution, since the photos this camera takes don't lose any apparent detail when downsampled to 640x480. In fact, I keep mine set at 640x480 all the time, because that's the only way to get decent detail out of it. Bottom line--this is a toy camera."
2,Not worth the price...,I bought one of these for myself a while ago - and while Im sure this was a great camera 7 years ago - its just not up to par anymore - Ive also seen the image quality deteriorate in the last few years ive had it - this is in all lighting situations as time moves along the pixels just get bigger and more noticeable.... Id say its realistically a 15 dollar digital camera you pick up at a drug store....thats what its worth.
2,Flash extremely bright,"I've had this camera for several years now, and never really noticed how bright the flash was. Now that I have an infant son I'm realizing. Most of the pictures that I've taken of him with this camera his eyes are shut! Everyone else seems to have normal flashes.The batteries do run down quickly, and the quality's not great which I don't mind too much. The flash is the reason I want to get rid of this camera now."
4,Finally got it,"It's been, oh, at least a month since I ordered Like Sands Through the Hourglass. After a few weeks I contacted the Seller. He decided that the book must be lost. I accepted his offer to send another copy. A couple of weeks later it arrived. The book was in good condition. As I missed giving it to my sister for her August birthday, I will use it for a Christmas gift. So, all is not lost. I will, however, hesitate to purchase another online gift."
5,Hourglass is FULL of FUN,I am a Big Fan of Days of Our Lives. The book was full of memories from the lives of Susan and Bill. Pictures and stories from their meeting on the Days set; their lives until current times and even some pictures before their meeting. It was a walk down Memory Lane for me. I LOVED IT!!
5,Bill and Susan/Doug and Julie,"This book is so very candid. You get to live Bill and Susans' lives. Every page is exciting. A fast read, you will not be able to put it down.. Enjoyed the family pictures. I have been a fan of Days of our lives for 35 years. My Dad became a fan because of Bill Hayes. He had great memories of Bill's shows. Loved the Book! Any Days of our Lives fan must have This book in their library."
4,Great Book!,"The old die hard Days of Our Lives fans will love reading about Bill and Susan. You can see a lot of Julie Williams at times in Susan. Perhaps why she was so fantastic at playing this character. It goes into many of the personal stories of how this loving couple came together, and have stayed in love for all the days of their lives. Even if you haven't watched ""Days"" and you enjoy the biographies of the stars, this one is a great afternoon read. It's written well, following the careers of both from their early beginnings, through Days, and after. You'll find Bill is a down to earth, giving, loving man. Susan is fiesty, sometimes quirky, and a strong take care of her man kind of woman. You'll certainly enjoy this book!"
5,Like walking on air,You would not belive how comfortable these shoes are unless you get a pair. These shoes are so cute and the wedge heel..... well lets just say you will keep looking down at your feet in amazement on the fact that you have a (high) wedge shoe on with out the pain.
5,Great shoe,"I did need to size up. I had to stretch these, however they are quite stylish and the height of the heel which I initially thought would be a strain actually are not at all. Aerosoles are great for comfort."
3,not very good quality,"I has read reviews before buying this set. One reviewer had favorably compared the quality these clamps to that of Bessey's quality. I am here to say the quality is nowhere near the quality of Bessey. The price alone should have been the true indicator of the quality to me. I have had this set for three montha and have already pulled the bar out of the top arm by simply clamping wood down to my workbench. Many of the clamps are not straight right out of the box, the bars tilt to one side or the other when clamped. That being said, for the money these are what you would expect. If you are serious about the quality of your tools then look elsewhere. These do not hold their own against Bessey at all."
3,Bad packaging,"I have had those clamps for a few months now and they work great.It is especially handy to have all those different sizes, makes it very versatile.Still I would only give it 3 stars for 2 problems that could easily be improved by the seller and/or manufacturer:* a few of the clamps came with damaged handles. Those are made of wood and there was some serious chipping on some of them.* the biting part of the clamp is covered with a rubber cap that prevents damage if using them with soft material (wood for example). Those clamps come off very easily and you always have to make sure you didn't loose one around. There were actually 2 missing by the time I received the package, most likely went through the holes of the package during shipping. They mix and match between most of the clamp sizes so as long as you don't use all your clamps at once you are fine."
3,Ok - for the money,Not bad but I prefer clamps with a clutch to make clamp setups easier. These tend to slide out of position on me before I have a chance to torque them down sometimes. So they don't sit well in my clamp rack for the same reason - without a clutch they don't hold their position unless they are torqued down on somethingThey flex a fair amount when tightened - but same with my other (cheap) clamps.This package is only worth it if you need a lot of clamps and are too cheap to get something better. If you only need a few I would recommend buying a smaller package of better quality or buying individual high quality clamps.Not sure if I'd buy this set again... I'm not completely satisfied but I have plenty of clamps now of all sizes for a reasonable price
4,Good for the money,"I build coffins, and have a lot of clamping to do, with some weird angles. I bought two sets of these, so I have plenty of clamps to use while my glue dries. These clamps are a little difficult to lock on the shaft, but I am learning the tricks. Could have had a little bigger handles, or possibly had some knurled handles, but all in all these clamps are sufficient for what I need. Heavy duty squeezing is reserved for the PONY acme thread screw type clamps. I would reccomend the Denali clamps to anyone."
4,Denali 30-Piece Bar Clamp Assortment,"Excellent clamps for the money. While the end caps do fall off and the clamping surfaces aren't machined to a perfect surface, they are an awesome array of clamps at a truly bargain basement price. Where else are you gong to get bar clamps for $3.50 each. I always use cauls when clamping so any surface imperfections don't reach the finished product. I give them a 4-star rating due purely to the packaging. As many other reviewers have mentioned the packaging is terrible. They arrived in a box that had been re-taped multiple times by the shipping company. All of the parts were there but it was easier and safer to finish shredding the box and tape, then remove the clamps from the debris left."
4,good for the price,packaging was kind of torn up but all clamps were in good shape. I tried them on a couple of boards in the shop and they seem to hold fine with no slippage. I got mine for $99.00 with FREE shipping so it was a great deal in my opinion.
4,Good Value,"For the $$$, this is a great set of clamps. Not as sturdy as clamps costing twice as much (but I don't expect that). However, if you need a good set of medium duty clamps you can't go worng with these. There are sizes to fit nearly all needs and they are quite sturdy for the price. I think these were a good deal, and compliment our heavier pipe clamp collection very well. Nothing's worse than running out of clamps!"
1,Don't bother,"Purchased this and and it didn't work. Contacted Excalibur directly and they weren't surprised. They promptly refunded my money once I mailed proof of purchase over. Was so looking forward to this game, totally disappointed."
3,"Not necessarily ""manufacturer's packaging""","I purchased this cartridge based upon the fact that it is original HP ink (never waste money on other replacements-they leak!), that it was a lower price than suggested retail and that it was available through Amazon Prime. I have to say that the fact they advertise this as ""manufacturer's packaging"" in not completely true as it is not in the outer box as is shown in the photo, but only shipped in the foil packet. They really should specify this, and I sincerely hope that this ink is authentic HP!"
1,Cartridge has a 2009 date!,"I knew I was in trouble when the package was not the familiar HP box but a sickly grey plastic package. I bought this product based on the 'Fulfilled by Amazon' description as I do not know the seller. The cartridge has a 2009 date on it. When I loaded it into my printer, it indicated the ink was past expiry date(Duh) and use would void my printer warranty!! I took it out of my printer as quickly as I could. I expected better quality control from Amazon especially since it was fulfilling the order."
2,product arrived out of box - so no expiration date available,"Product arrived very quickly, and was in the factory-original ""plastic"" airtight pouch. However, it was NOT in the original box, so I had no way of seeing the expiration date. the expiration date is printed on the box, not on the inner pouch. the pouch was a little battered looking, like it had been around awhile. haven't actually opened the pouch yet, since my current cartridge still has a bit of life left in it, so not sure how it will actually work. not happy."
1,Cartridge Cyan,"August 16, 2012 I ordered the HP88XL Magenta and Cyan. I had to replace the Magenta and Cyan but now I have a problem with the printer and cannot print because it gives me the following message: ""Cyan is outdated cartridge"" Could you please tell me what to do?"
1,Do not buy dated material from this vendor,Product was out of date (expired) By the time I realized this it was too late to return.After spending a hour on the phone with hp help. The solution was to get a new cartrage the was not expired!!Had to toss. A complete waste of money.Do NOT buy dated material from this vendor!!
3,What is Cyan anyway?,"This ink is perfect for my K550n printer. But, it is still just ink. There is not much more to say. It's expensive, but the quality is excellent. Don't be fooled and buy the noname replacement. If you do, you will be very disapointed in the future when your printout fades away."
5,Awesome Product,Love these cartridges. They are easy to install. Last a long time. Have excellent print quality!!!
1,Good Cartridge....but the WORST shipping ever,"I ordered 3 of these cartridges (1 yellow, 1 cyan and 1 magenta), Asked amazon to group it into as few packages as possible, and what do i get?A Plastic bubble wrap lined envelope with 3 cartridges in them, where the cartridge boxes almost changed shape to match the cartridge inside them.This is by far the worst experience i've had so far from Amazon (probably because they decided to ship it with UPS)Hope the next purchaser has better luck than i did...."
1,Bad reception,"... There are several things that are annoying about this phone. The first is that the reception is really bad and you hear a faint buzz all the time. I really hate that. The second is that usually on phones there's a ringer volume setting on the base or on the phone itself. I wasn't able to find one. I'm not sure if it's in the menu system, but the menu system is difficult to figure out, and I'm usually pretty adept at those things. The third thing is that I don't have Caller ID set up, so this kind of phone that includes features for Caller ID is sort of pointless for me. And the only way to set the phone's time is with the Caller ID function. So, the time on my phone remains wrong. I'm going to take it back ..."
2,High-Pitched Whine,"I am not sure why it is, but I have a high-pitched whine sound that comes out of the phone. It is the part that you carry around. It happens when it isn't turned on. I haven't seen anything about this in troubleshooting or FAQ's in the manual or the website. Actually, this model doesn't even appear on the website yet. I will for sure be taking this back tomorrow. It does look extremely cool and is sleek as all get out. Also be careful, the wallmount doesn't seem very stable as far as holding the phone in place. If it wasn't put back properly, it might fall and shatter. Better spend more money and get a higher quality phone."
1,This phone is HORRIBLE,"Brand new, EXTREME STATIC right out of the box!! Take it back if you recieved it as a Christmas present!"
1,Completely useless phone,"I did not buy it from Target but just had to voice my opinion. I agree with all of the other comments regarding this phone. It looks cool and is cheap. I purchased it several months ago for $29 and got 2 separate $10 mail-in-rebates. It was not used much until recently when I found out that it is completely useless. Even when you are standing next to the phone, it often sounds like a mistuned AM radio. Forget about using it in another room. Pressing the channel button rarely improves call clarity. Though it looks like it is an ergonomic phone, when holding the earpiece straight against your ear, the mouthpiece ends up several inches off the side of your cheek. So you are unintellible to the caller on the other end. To compensate, you end up shouting or mashing the phone into your cheek to hear and speak at the same time. It has certainly been too long for me to return it. So it will be permanently retired to the hall of shame (i.e. garbage can)."
1,Great--For looks only.,"We love the look of the phone, but its (un) usefullness is another issue. Not once have we used the phone and not complained about it. The reception has never been good-it has an echo and static even when standing near the base. We have tried moving the base, standing both close and far away, nothing seems to work. Many times people have asked if I was in a bathroom because of the echo. It is also hard to hear the other person on the phone through all the static, I found myself trying to smash the phone against my ear in an effort to understand people. It looks great, but we don't even plug it in anymore b/c it is pretty much useless."
1,Don't Buy This Phone!!!,"My husband bought me this phone as a gift because I wanted a phone to use as a headset that also had caller ID.This phone looks good, but that's about it! First of all it won't keep a charge, if you have talked on the phone for about 30 minutes, it won't pick up again if you try to make another call. I have to put it back on the base for a few minutes to be able to answer the phone again. Also, when you are on the phone and another call comes in, a sound like a fax machine screaches in your ear, and you cannot continue talking until several seconds. Then, you are still not always able to flash over to the other call or see the caller ID of the person calling.God bless my husband, he meant well, but this phone is going back ASAP!"
1,Bad voice sound,"I purchased this phone about a month ago, the receiver sound is so sensitive, that I have to mute the TV when I answer it. Also, while the incomming call voice sounds fine, the outgoing voice is horrible, I get complaints from everyone, and am returning it ASAP!!!!"
2,"Looks good, but...","I love the look of the phone, but have been sorely disappointed with the performance. Even sitting 5 feet from the base, there is an inexcusable amount of static and interference just when moving your head from side to side. The other party doesn't seem to be able to hear it, but you would think that at least in the same room they could get more of a signal out of 2.4 GHz."
1,THIS PHONE SUCKS !!!,I am not going to waste my time explaining- this phone cant even hold a 5 minute charge- so if your like my wife and like to talk on the phone more than 5 minutes- this phone is not for you. I can go on for hours telling you how awful this phone is- but rather than aggravate myself and break this phone in a million pieces im headed back to target to return this...and get a real phone- maybee a vtech
1,P.O.S.,I bought this phone two days ago and although it looks cool and matches my kithcen accessories this phone does not work very well. I get major static and feedback while on the phone. I have tried switching channels several times with no better results. I will take this phone back and spend a little more to try and find a better phone. The LCD display is also difficult to read unless it is held at a perfect angle.
5,Amazing insight into Tuck's technique,"This video is a very detailed instruction into the amazing fingerstyle techniques of Tuck. Tuck is perhaps one of the finest guitarists in history and this video will be beneficial to all guitar players beginninng to advanced, playing any style. Highly recommended!!! What a joy to have detailed comprehensive private lessons from Tuck......which you can pause and play over and over again. 5 stars for sure! Thanks Tuck!"
5,what every modern fingerstyle needs!!!,"This is a great instructional dvd for beginners and advanced guitar players alike. This is full of great ideas both simple and complex that could add to your arsenal of guitar playing skills. Also Tuck himself is your guitar tutor and he explains his technique in a simple way that almost anyone can understand. A couple of good things about this dvd is that in the special features, all the exercises (lessons) are listed where you could play it in real time or slow mo with the option of loop, meaning it repeats the exercises over and over in SLOW MO (really great for me, because some of his examples are crazily complex to understand in real time). In conclusion, Buy this book if you want to be a more complete fingerstyle guitarplayer."
2,Not good,I don't like to write bad reviews but I must on this one. Extremely difficult to untwist. Not sure if this will ever be used.
2,Sometimes you get what you pay for...,"They work OK for a while, but it won't take too long before they break. They very cheaply made, which is to be expected for the price. The band is plastic, and the point where they connect to each ear muff is plastic and not very sturdy. After some use by the kids opening them up and putting them on, the plastic connection that snaps into place loosens up, and will continually come apart. Since they're adjustable enough to get more than one season out of them for the kids, we'll look for a better quality pair next time."
4,Finally found them!,"I had been shopping in stores, and could not find ""traditional"" ear muffs. It only took me 5 minutes through Amazon.com to find exactly what I wanted. These ear muffs are comfortable, sized right, and a great price."
2,Not that great,They are not very comfy or user friendly. It took me 10 min just to figure out how to put them on. I would look for something else.
1,Ear Muffs,"They were very cheaply made,Thank goodness they were just for little girls,I would have been embarrassed if I'd have ordered them for a gift for someone.I know I shouldn't expect alot for $5., but I'd have thought they'd be better than they were."
3,smaller than I expected,"The earmuffs were a gift, and were all right, but much smaller than I expected for a man. They would be good for a female. Warm, not very sturdy or substantial."
1,very bad craftsmanship,"I bought a pair of ear muffs. I'll never do that again on-line. They looked and sounded (from item description) well-made, but when I got them I couldn't wear them because they had rough edges that cut into the top of my head. Just very poor manufacturing! I would definitely never purchase such an item from this manufacturer again."
5,Ear Muffs,"The ear muff were just what I was looking for. They are even better than the ones I had lost. Not too big, just the right size."
4,Ear Muffs,I have been looking to replace an old pair of ear muffs for years and have been unable to find them at any retail stores. I have tried the new styles that are in the stores now and they aren't as comfortable or easy to store in your purse. I could tell from the description that they were the same as the old pair. They arrived quickly in the mail.
3,Handsome Range Maps,"This is a handsome volume, basically a glorification of the range maps found in most bird guides. Although the wintering grounds are shown for inter-continental migrants, little other new information is presented. I had hoped for more practical information, like where and when species are most likely to be found in the U. S."
2,white trash roots,"""Drum"":Warren Oates, Ken Norton (1976) A slaver buys Drum, (a black slave)a bordello queen's son, in 1860s New Orleans (110 minutes) -- ok , thats the caption, now my opinion (some of the best white trailer trash viewin you will ever want to see, this is purely for the uneducated who doesn't need to think. It's totally 70's. Put Blazzing Saddles into a serious drama and you got Drum. It's even more funny they would even classify this as a genre drama. If you have heard of ""Roots"" and not ""Drum"" there is a good reason why. If one is sensitive to racial slurs, this movie is not for you."
5,Handbook of Transportation Engineering,This book is a great tool to keep in the arsenal for solving modern civil engineering problems. Its clear and concise without all the fluff in other texts of its type. Chapter 13 ROCKS!
2,It ain't all that,The first one I order was defective & Amazon replaced it. It will do the job it is designed for but Woodline could & should have done a better job with the scale. It is loosely placed in the slot so it will move & it appears to be reversed. I would much rather spend the additional $10. & buy the compition from Rockler also available from Amazon. I was disappointed with Woodline's subquality.
3,light weight chest ezpander cardiovascular strength,not worth the money handles to small for a man's hand plus tube connection at handles to cheap and break easy where a little ball in tube suppose to connect the tube to the handle look for other type's Lou
1,Poor Quality and Dangerous!!!,"This cheap thing broke on first usage. The handle shattered, and the rubber cords flew and hit my head, giving me a gash.I would not recommend this to anyone. I gave it a one star only because zero or negative stars weren't available."
3,I got one from Ebay --,"Everyone has talked about the tube disconnect from the handle, and that's what I noticed, since it was based on a ball inserted inside the tube and since the tube is rubber like, so Offcourse the tube will disconnect from the ball by stretching ! !What I did, I brought a plastic bag, and cut it in straps and tried to stretch each strap to create a thread of nylon plastic and I was successful and then I made knots just above the ball in the tube - Make sure everything is in place - and I wrapped up many times with knots. This creates a resistance, so the ball will never came off unless the plastic nylon thread will be cut off by the resistance and this is unlikely to happen ! This is only a solution ! I will give an update in another month just to see if my trick works !"
1,inexpensive exercisee equipment,"This is a very disappointing piece of junk. I thought it would be elastic cords. Not so, its plastic tubes inserted into the small handle. I know it only cost $10 but it's not worth the shipping cost."
1,This book [stinks],"This book [stinks]!I bought this book trying to merge my knowledge of ColdFusion and Flash. It disappointed me. It gives you step-by-step instructions but doesn't give you the ""whys"".It will not teach you ColdFusion or Flash or other techniques like generating XML to crate objects in Flash.If you want to learn ColdFusion get other book (like Forta's or Brooks'). If you want to learn Flash well this is the wrong book because 80 % of it is pure HTMLI just wasted my time and money with this book."
2,Didn't seem like much time was put into the recording,The CD starts out great....But as I listened more I could easily tell that they we're rushed through this project. I'm sure they'll have more and time and money to spend on their next one. Seeing this band live is much more exciting than this CD and I highly recommend it. The horns seem to be playing out of tune with the rest of the band on the entire CD. The overall mix could of made this group from San Diego sound so much better.
4,"Very Funky & Soulful, good pick, chich wails a bit","Overall good disk, chick wails some. Great live band for San Diego. Gran Torino is a better disk with a similar sound, a little harder hitting."
3,some things should stay in the vaults,"King records produced many classic sides in the 50s; unfortunately, none of them are contained in this collection. Even the one song I bought this collection to get, Honkey Tonk, is an outtake. There's nothing especially wrong with this collection; it's all solid R&B from the mid to late 50s, it's just that there are no standout songs or performances. There are no lost classics here; no classics of any kind."
2,"Great subject matter, too bad its so poorly written.","A tribute to Hungary's best and brightest deserves cogent writing. In Made in Hungary, Mr. Simon, fails to even utilize basic English grammer. The errors are too common, too glaring and time and time again I found myself wondering who could have edited and published a book with so many obvious errors. In addition, throughout thebook Mr. Simon makes numerous unsupportable and sometimes outrageous statements. My advice is to pass this book up and wait until someone with some writing ability tackles the subject."
3,Traditional but still original,"If you like electrified blues-rock with masculine rough vocals, I advise you to check out Omar & The Howlers. The fact is that this band sound very similar on their albums (with exception of ""Swingland""), but I guess ""World wide open"" is their best effort. The music bare connection to Tony Joe White's Swamp Blues style. The approach is raw but the songs usually have an attractive hook or melody. The only, or in fact the main problem is that music in this genre have a tendency to be very boring in the long run, but I believe Omar & The Howlers are better than others in avoiding this trap since their much more original than say Walter Trout."
4,Good for airtools,Got this for my air tools... You gotta use it unless you want your air tools rusting and or not working later on ...Does the job. Happy with it.
4,great songs and artists,"Songs from Hayden, Rebecca Gates, My Morning Jacket, Lanterna, and other remarkable singer/songwriters. Celebrates Badman's 5 year anniversary with these 10 rare and recent album tracks. Good mellow listening in a beautiful package."
3,Murding Mr. Monti: B-,"This was a fun, quick read with a good share of humor. If you're looking for a light weekend read - this is the book for you."
2,disappointing,"I really wanted to find out about the Santo Daime movement, and while this book has a lot of information, there is just way too much of the very mental ramblings of the author. While in many books this is a good thing, here it is a real distraction."
3,Down South Hip Hop,If you like hard core music that keeps it real then you will love lil boosie and weebie. Some of my favorite tracks are: Swerve and Bad Chick also known as Bad B_t_ h. This music is only for people whom do not get easily offended and for those who appreciate great baselines.
3,Nice book in lousy binding,"This is an excellent guide to the best NY restaurants and to some of the more interesting neighborhood restaurants. I wish there were a bit more information about the size and setting, smoking areas and so on. But by far the greatest drawback of this book is its execrable binding. After only limited use, my copy began to disintegrate, not exactly what one desires in a reference book that one hopes to carry around. This is inexcusable. Back to the Michelin Guides for me! I have a 39 Michelin France Guide that is still hanging together. Planned obsolescence!!!"
4,Super positive-vibes!,"Bottles with similar proportions are ""bulk"" size, but this is a petite 13oz, so I was a little surprised. This isn't a bulk size bottle. I also think the price is fairly high for something the size of a normal body wash... 3x higher than something of the same volume.That said, the scent is amazing. It delivers! The optimism it promises is no joke. I was expecting a little more bergamot, but the scent is an awesome cucumbery-citrusy-spice, and it works well.Extremely happy with the scent, a little disappointed by the size/price ratio = 4 stars from me.I'll probably buy from them again."
2,Returned,I returned this product because the weights were too long and hard to handle. They also were very flimsy and flopped around while I was using them.
3,ok buy,"I was using water jugs for my exercise routine, so buying weights was an actual step up. Weights are weights so in that they serve their purpose. However, because they are filled with sand and not that tightly packaged, I find my wrist struggling just a bit when lifting these (even though they are 5 pounds i'm pretty weak!). Also, the band could be a little bit more snug."
2,Flimsy,"Item was too flimsy to hold and needs to be either packed tight or better, have a solid core to keep it from bending too much. The garter strap was a nice idea but implemented poorly. It was too big & doesn't really help. End up returning the 5-pounder the next day."
5,great idea!,"These are really comfortable and give my workouts that extra boost I wanted. I got the 5lb weights and that seems perfect for me. My hands are small, or so I think, and while they don't go completely around the weight, I am able to hold on ok. I do agree that it would be more comfortable if they were not so wide. A great benefit to me is that they won't damage our hardwood floors if they were to be dropped. Especially because my toddler thinks they are fun to play with!"
3,Old but classic,"I ordered this movie hoping it was another that I had seen in a theater about 48 years ago, but it was not. In the one I recalled: Marty Robbins had a much larger part and became involved with a saloon girl who worked with Falena the girl in the song, ""El Paso."" However, this one was also pretty cool. Faron Young played a sheriff, (which he also was in real life), and Marty Robbins played an outlaw, much to my surprise. Jim Davis was wickedly perfect in his role of over-bearing, land-grabbing bad guy. It was obviously copied from an old film, kind of seemed to skip info in certain places in the plot. Maybe it was that way originally, or just the copy. Still, I enjoyed the movie, and I am glad it has been preserved on DVD. Apparently, the one I was remembering has been lost, and that's too sad."
1,Cheated and disappointed,It saysdouble feature but in my roku i only got one so dont waste money.No t and a and hardly any plot
5,Love this Family of Dolls - Little Girl is Adorable,"FUN AND STURDY AND CAN BEND TO DO ANYTHING - WALK, LAY DOWN, WAIVE HELLO, BEND OVER, SIT IN A CHAIR OR LAY IN A TUB AND ALSO POSITION THEIR ARMS ARE ALL GREAT FEATURES."
5,the best Clon companion,"After gettin O clone international and O clone, I was lookin for more songs from El Clon, especially the belly dancin songs. Well I searched, and came upon this cd.And wow, this one blows the other two away.I mean, it's not just belly dancin music, but it also has songs like ""Kheops"", which is the song they played when Tio Ali was prayin to Mecca. Kinda a peaceful spiritual feel to it. After this cd, Marcus Vianna has definently become one of my favorite musicians."
3,"Average acting, good story line. History of West Point","This video is a good historical story line regarding the court marshal of a West Point black Cadet. It is a true account of what took place at that time. Interesting for those interested in history. Not very good acting. We enjoyed the movie, but we are also interested in West Point history."
4,Last Ridge,"I had been looking for a broader view of the latter stages of the ItalianCampaign. This book doesn't do that, but I guess it didn't purport to do so.It appears to be an excellent history of the 10th Division, its inception, itsformation and its training. It provides a worm's eye view of the taking ofMt. Belvedere, a brutal and heroic tale. A few maps would have made the accountmore comprehensible. How beautiful the side story that all the efforts inColorado to design and perfect gear were made useless when some Quartermastergenius decided that ""stuff"" could be left stateside as superfluous. Nothingchanges in the US Army.I had never known that a unit from the 10th ""fought"" on Kiska. I had a friend who had served with the 7th Division on Attu and Kiska and later on Kwajalein and Okinawa. His terse assessment was essentially, ""We had plenty of Japs on Attu.........we didn't mind they had abandoned Kiska."""
2,Different views,"It's ever interesting to see different views of some point of ""fact"" or history. We Brazilians for example, who had our soldiers fighting against the same enemy on the same region at the same time have a very diferent point of view about those facts. Yeah in deed ...A very curious, adaptable and malleable thing are the History..."
1,Does not work as advertised,"I bought the 900AP to use as a client and bridge, but found out after many hours that the client and bridging functions only workwith the DLink DWL-900AP and DWL-1000AP (See the FAQ on the DLink website). Unless you have one of those products already, this product only works as an limited access point. If you want an access point, the SMC 7004AWBR is much better. It alos has a router, webserver for configuration, switch, mac address filtering, better range, etc."
2,Works... barely,"The software included with this device is terrible. There were bugs everywhere, mispellings in the interface, etc. I downloaded the latest version from their website, which had improvements. After playing with it for a while, I got it working. However, some of the features of it don't work (like Mac address filtering) because the software is horrible. Also, the device just stops working periodically, and you need to mess with the configuration for a while until it'll start working again.I've been updating the firmware and Windows software for the past week (bought it last week), and it seems like they put up a new version of the firmware every 2 days. This is probably a fair indicator that the device was released with immature software, and that they're struggling to get the thing to a point where it actually works for their customers.I do not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Poor UI--Mac Address Filtering works...,"I'm in agreement with the review from September 30. The software included with the DWL900AP is sorely lacking. There were times where my hitting the 'Apply' button had no discernable impact on the Access Point's operation. Only after I hit 'OK' and re-loaded would the Access Point change its behavior.In addition, if you install the USB drivers for the access point on a computer, despite USB's hot-swap ability, make sure you reboot prior to trying to modify configurations.But you can get mac address filtering to work. The file needs to be in a specific format. Each address must be on it's own line, and the last line in the file should be empty (i.e. hit Enter after you're done entering the last entry)."
5,Excellent recovery plan,"This is an amazing book for anyone suffering from reduced self esteem, trauma - emotional, physical or otherwise. All professionals should read this book and use the material for helping people with food addiction enter a logical and sensible recovery plan."
2,Not getting a prime time slot.,"Now, I like slotted spoons. You can sift through the liquids and get the solids. That's kind of the point, right? But this spoon? The slots are HUGE. You want to spoon some baked beans but want more beans and less goo? Too bad! Half the beans are going bye-bye thanks to Monty and his huge slots. Next time I want huge slots action, I'll go to Vegas.It's also kind of thin and flimsy. I mean, I know it's cheap, but it's CHEAP. Not very long, either, so don't bother using it in big pots.C'mon, Monty. You can do better than this. Or maybe not. I don't even know you. But your slotted spoon is pretty bad."
4,the title says it all,"Good book for folks who want to watch their waistline and also have desserts. I love Susan's other book (let them eat cake) a little better (mostly because this has a LOT of cheesecake recipes that I do not like at all, but that is just me). I have made several recipes (I especially liked the fruit crisp topping which I keep handy in my fridge for instant crisp in the microwave, and the chocolate biscotti) in the book and most of them are good enough that I have no need for the full fat version."
5,Review of Roger McGuinn DVD,This was a birthday gift for a friend of mine. He was very surprised and just loved it. He plays a 12-string guitar almost as well as Roger and there is a technique Roger uses that my friend wanted to learn. It is a great DVD.
3,12 string instruction for more advanced student from an expert,Was hoping this would have been little less advanced. Not enough instruction for the middle of the road player.
1,DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT BUYIT'S NOT AT ALL WORTH THE MONEY. I HAVE BEEN PLAYNG THE 12 STRING FOR ABOUT 12 YEARS , THIS DVD WAS USELESS / DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY"
1,Bad design,"We as a maintenance company have bought a lot of bosch pro tools, and this sander has destroyed my faith in bosch! Im on my second GSS 140A with in 2 months and the front clip has broken again! The second tool has less than 3 hours on it!Rather get the Makita equivilent."
3,Great sander if you don't expect fine performance,"I bought this sander about 3 years ago mostly for general purpose stuff around the house. As I started to get more into furniture making and wanting finer finishes, I found that this sander did not produce as good a result as I had expected. It tends to leave a lot of swirl marks in my projects, even after going through 100 grit, then 150 grit sandpapers. Maybe its just my technique, but I think I will look for something a little better at being a ""random orbit"" that does not leave the swirl marks. Still, I plan on keeping with the Bosch brand as I have been happy with my table saw, circular saw, and even this little sander for the most part."
1,"Works well new, but quickly falls apart","I have had three of these sanders. When they are new out of the box, they work great. However after several hours of use the front gripper looses it strength and will not hold the sheets of sandpaper in place.This problem is acute with fine grit papers and I frequently have the front edge of the paper come loose and start flopping around less than a minute after inserting a new sheet. The front edge will come loose even if you're not sanding anything - just running the tools causes it to get loose and flop around.When this happened on my first sander I thought it might have been a manufacturing defect. However this has happened with all three of these that I have owned and it appears to be a design flaw.The rear gripper is great. It's too bad that the whole tool is rendered useless by a poorly designed front gripper.I suppose I could try stick on paper; but then what's the point of the 'SheetLoc??"
1,It had a MAJOR design flaw: the rubber gets worded out after few usage,"in less than 1 year the tool is useless. the paper slips out. the rubber gets soft and breaks into pieces (melts actually, they used cheap materials on that or because of the vibration).I bought BOSCH because it looked nice and the locking mechanism seemed very easy. BUT in less than a year the holding rubber broke on both ends. and the paper slips out after few seconds.don't buy it or tested it out in you 30 day allowance. (90 at HD)..AND the filter doesn't stay locked in place also. it is frustrating to use this tool. - believe me - I like Bosch tool because but this is trash. looks cool but..."
2,Poor front gripper design,"I stuffed this sander in a drawer shortly after I bought it because the front gripper failed to hold the securely. The concept is wonderful but in practice, it makes the tool frustrating to use. The sand paper falls off after less than a minute of sanding. Either that or the rubber gripper on the front clamp comes off.Recently, I've started using it again. I spray the back of the sandpaper with 3M 77 adhesive before attaching it. Voila, it works. I like the sander but I cannot believe they are still selling this tool given the faulty design."
1,Clamping Bar Does Not Work,"Always though that bosh was a good brand of tools. I have many of them. (I am a professional cabinet maker), but this tool is for an armature who uses a sander a few days a month, who considers changing paper to be a problem. yes the paper goes in easily, but, unfortunately, it comes out just as easily. with this sander you will be spending more time adjusting the paper than sanding. Also as the paper moves under the clamping bar it gradually sands off the plastic that holes the paper in place. making the problem worse and worse. BTW the replacement clamping bar costs $5.06 plus shipping . Repairing it is not worth it."
1,Don't buy,"This sander WILL fail to hold paper with in 3 to 5 months with medium use. Mine was not defective it is flawed in design. The sheetlock system is only slightly faster and not worth the trouble of failure. The horrible thing is if you want to just keep replacing the assembly you cant. Bosch discontinued it along with the bottom pad assembly. The guys that reviewed this thing well have only had it a short while. All the bad reviews have used it for a few months. Go with another brand with the basic sheet holding design, its proven.-Mark"
2,Very poor dust collection.,"A great little sander if you had a downdraft table. The dust collection did not pull anything through to the bag. I attached a shop vac using the adapter (sold seperately) and same difference. Sanded one small cabinet door and this beast threw dust all over the place. The sandpaper ""punch"" is a real piece of crap."
1,Doesn't Anyone Make a Decent 1/4 Sheet Sander?,"Throw me in with the crowd that had problems with the front grip failing. The little rubber piece on the front sand paper clamp comes off. This happened intermittently for a while, but I could always stretch it back on and for the most part, the sander was ok. Just a few minutes ago it failed for good. I put the grip back on, and it takes seconds to fly off again. When its not on, the sand paper isn't attached to the rotating plate and you have a useless piece of junk. I was in the middle of a project and got angry enough that I chucked it at the cement floor, and well...its in sander heaven now.This is my second 1/4 sheet sander in 2 years. My first was a Ryobi that failed on one of the gripper bars, but that was the cheapest sander in the store. This failure is especially disappointing coming from Bosch and being the most expensive sander of this type. Doesn't anyone make a good 1/4 sheet sander?"
5,Easy to use,This sander works as advertised and the sheetlock system is easy to use. It comes with a nice carrying case and everything you need to get started (except sand paper).
3,Not great for heavy use,"I've own this tool for 2.5 years, and have used it heavily, it worked great until recently. Now the paper hold down mechanism is finished. Rubber elements required to hold sand paper have worn off, and the pivot holes that the metal portion of hold down mechanism pivots in are now worn to a point that they are worthless. This is a great machine for the occassional user, but will not last long term under heavy use."
1,Quit after 12 hrs,"My sander stopped after 2 days, about 12 hrs of work. I sanded the paint off the plaster walls because some genius painted with latex over oil without the proper priming and the latex paint began to flake off. The sander worked well at first and it was very easy to change the sand paper. But then it just did not turn on after I replaced sand paper once again. This sander was made in Mexico. I read all Amazon reviews before choosing this sander and I have other Bosch power tools that seem to be reliable. I am very disappointed with the sander."
2,Quality product ?,"My bosch sander lasted me about 9 months before the motor burned out. I didn't use it every day mostly weekends and it often sat for weeks at a time. I bought the vacuum attachment and strictly used this sander attached to a vac to sand sanding sealer. The hole punch was poor at best, I think a pencil eraser is more pointed than the puinches on the plasic plate. The paper changing system is pretty convenient, or better than others I have used. I didn't save my receipt when I bought it a lowes and Bosch didn't make any effort to help me out with getting a new sander even though they admitted that the sander still should be under warrenty because of the serial numbers. I like most Bosch tools and will continue to purchase them if the fit my needs, but I woun't buy this sander again."
3,Bosch 1/4 Sheet Sander,I am a professional cabinetmaker and I use mostly Bosch power tools in my shop. The sander is well made and operates quite nicely. The concept of the clamping mechanism is a good idea however it does not hold up under production use. The rear clamping bar has rubber pads that are suppose to pinch and hold an abrasive piece of sandpaper which over time gradually wear away and then will not hold the sandpaper in place. I've had two of these sanders recently and both have suffered the same malfunction. I wish there was some way they could redesign the rear holding mechanism.
1,Where's the advertised-as-included vacuum adapter?,"I had great expectation for this sander but the included vacuum adapter was the RS007 for a 19mm hose, not the RS006 adapter for American sized hoses. The Bosch web site says the RS006 adapter is included but it's not in the package. The I'm not going to order the adapter (at extra cost), so it's going back."
3,Warning: This blade is for metal.,"When I complained to Freud about splintering on hardwood miters, I was told that the P1296N is for cutting non-ferrous metals!"
1,dark ages,the story is offensive to women. for an educated woman the heroine is weak. the hero belong to the the dark ages. he thought everyone is below his regard including the heroine. he was a horrible person. he was nice to the heroine in the last pages.
2,ditto,"Agree with review below mine. Don't be upset with my humble opinion here. I'm not enlightened, whatever that means, and still don't know the answer to this koan. Maybe Bodhidharma didn't know either. Maybe the question doesn't make sense. Anyways I was not hoping for spiritual awakening, just an interesting movie. In any case this movie is well not too interesting. Contains some nice images. For a truly interesting, really well made movie that depicts Buddhist monks and is about Buddhist/Eastern spirituality then I wholeheartedly recommend to you ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"".EDIT: I just had to come back and edit this review because I accidentally left out the word ""not"" as in not hoping for a spiritual experience. I really wasn't. Zen and the Art of Watching Movies would be a silly book.2.5 stars."
2,"""The Real Koan - Why are Viewers Duped?!""","An awful movie for two reasons: pretentious and empty as a film, and worse, as a supposed example (I can't even say ""masterpiece"" ) of ""Zen"", basically fraudulent. Slow tracking nature shots and third grade level spouting of Buddhist aphorisms (and literal use of the ox parable - ugh!) do not constitute ""Zen."" Real zen practice is not divorced from the nitty gritty reality of modern life ; thinking that this movie will somehow get you on the path to prajna paramita (the ""other shore"", i.e., enlightenment) is like saying that watching ""Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer"" or ""The Grinch"" will let you understand the meaning of Christianity's origin.It's obvious now why Mr. Bae has never made another film: and it's unfortunate that so many people's wish to ""see"" Zen philosophy /spirituality has caused them to suspend their critical discernments and project depth into this amatuerish production. Decent, if unchallenging, cinematography though (hence the two stars)."
1,Philosophy you get from a fortune cookie and post card images,"Thank you master for hitting me with a stick of boredom.I stopped watching this mess midway through. There is nothing here to keep my attention either with a message or an image. All I asked for was a reason, one silly reason to keep watching, but it can't even come up with one. If you want to be bored, by all means buy or rent this movie, and then tell all your friends the title so you can come off as interesting.Instead of watching this movie-like object, go read The Outsider by Colin Wilson and thank me for both saving you from this and leading you to something."
1,Incredibly boring,"I have never seen a more boring movie in my life. I saw this with my family when it got good reviews, and we could not suffer through the whole movie."
5,Meditative Zen Movie,"I am seeing this movie third time. Frankly speaking I doubt that common western viewers can understand fully the stories without background of introductory Zen. I think this movie is full of symbolism on Zen and eastern philosophy. For example, the positions, moving rhythms, and angles of camera usually are from the observer or the shelf. Karma is a main principle supporting the story. Even without any knowledge on Zen, this movie is still meditative, or very boring to make you sleep peacefully.I heard that the original movie was luckily found by the director himself for DVD production. Original sound is mono. English translation seemed to be good and concise. The director is a professor in Korea, and this is the first and last movie he made for public. I heard that he spent seven years for this movie in the Ji-ri Mountain in the southern Korea."
4,Art documentary,"Saw a clip of this on line,decided to buy disc rather than download.many good ideas on mixed media art.Can use in my own work."
1,Does absolute opposite,The concept of the product is great but it doesn't work. It actually does the opposite. My nail polish started chipping the next day and I was being careful. Not only did it chip but in huge chunks which never used to happen before using this product.
4,"Sexy gift for her, great toy for you!","She really liked getting these as a gift. They look great and stay out of the way of fun time. They add flair and a bit of mystique to the area, which makes things pretty exciting.She will sneak these on often to see if you're paying attention!On the con side: while the material is reasonably soft and comfortable (guy perspective), they weren't quite as soft and delicate as I'd envisioned. This isn't all bad, as being a little heavier material they can stand a little.. abuse."
5,Fun and Frolic,Want to spice up your life.... buy these for your wife or girlfriend. You won't be disappointed.Richard :)c
3,Four Dollars More Gets You Chicago,"The ""Reprint permissions"" (p. xii) indicate excerpts from the Chicago Manual of Style in ch. 2, 14 and 21 of Bonura's very short primer. For less than five dollars more, you can get all of the Chicago Manual of Style + its extensive chapter 17 on indexing--what a deal! Bonura's ""real-world examples"" to managing an index (pp.123-125) are unclear--it's hard to see what he is trying to illustrate. Sorry, the 'art' of indexing is just too much 'marketing' for the price."
2,Obscure examples cloud picture,"I had no experience in indexing and so did learn a lot from this book. However, for the most part I found it confusing. I was especially disappointed that he used unfamiliar topics for his examples, making it impossible to relate them to the point he was trying to make or to my own work."
5,A good book for beginners,"I liked this book and the way it is written. The subtopics allow the reader to go to whatever category she wishes. You don't have to read through the whole book to find what you want. I especially liked the entries on sample indexes, editing an index, and the check list."
5,To All Who Are In Need . . .,"The world has always been in need of healing - of something. In this book, Joel Goldsmith gives us the principle of TRUE healing, whether it be physical, financial, emotional, or any number of other things from which the world continues to suffer.Spiritual healing, today, can be likened to crystals, candles, aromatherapy, psychological mumbo-jumbo, etc. Joel Goldsmith, through his personal dedicated journey, goes to the ROOT of the problem and one which individuals very likely have no cognizance of, unless, of course, they've already read other of Joel's works and have discovered the secret.This is one of the first books I ever read by Goldsmith and I started in the early 1980s. I bought it mainly for curiosity but it soon appeared on my 'Best of the Best' book list and continues to be so.Gail Gupton, Author: The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment and Seekers of Truth"
4,Smacks of Christian Sciene without its spiritual logic,"This book reminds me of ideas I learned in Christian Science Sunday School, but he doesn't give it the solidly spiritual basis Mary Baker Eddy does in her Science and Health. His recognition of the healthful effects of getting closer to God will be helpful to many, but to me the view of man as wholly spiritual provides the only logical basis for spiritual healing. I'd also like to think that the medical profession will someday recognize the efficacy of spiritual treatment for physical illness. 'Works great for me!"
4,Typical Joey Negro Production,"Not much to say about this release other than if you like Joey Negro's disco workouts and/or Jocelyn Brown's dance songs, this is a sure winner. Nice, catchy and upbeat song. Jocelyn Brown, as always, is in excellent voice. Recommended."
5,Does what it says,"I use this on many things. Put it on the threads of things that you will leave bolted up for a long a time, but know that you will need to remove eventually. Helps on plastic fittings as well."
4,"Good stuff, in a small package.","I must say, I do like this grease but I was thinking it was a bigger container. I would have given it 5 stars if it was bigger. I know the description says 4oz but I wasn't expecting it to be such a small amount. I just wish you were getting more for what you're paying. At least it was a Prime item so I didn't have to pay shipping."
3,Strange Mix,"I don't know where they got these tracks from but they are truly ""surprising"" and sometimes not in a good way. I am used to the rich sound of Al's guitar, so the banjo tracks on the CD really don't appeal to me. I liked most of the other tracks on the CD."
1,Confused,"This is the kind of book that creates the impression that psychiatry deals with arbitrary collections of symptoms, with little understanding of what causes the symptoms. The book's occasional attempts to describe evolutionary influences rarely describe any connection between the symptoms and reproductive fitness, leave me wondering whether they have a clue about evolutionary theory.For better insights into this subject, read the book Shadow Syndromes, which describes some disorders as extremes of traits which provide benefits in more moderate forms. And read The Nurture Assumption to see what's wrong with Bowlby's attachment theory that Stevens and Price mention approvingly."
1,Jungian psychology,"Interesting book, but it doesn't deliver. It hasn't suceeded in bringing an up to date evolutionary account of development.J.R. Harris The Nurture Assumption and S. Pinker's The Blank Slate: the Modern Denial of Human Nature discredits attachment theory with astounding empirical strength. Evolutionary Psychiatry seems to be bogged down by its freudian/jungian heritage in its emphasis on attachment. Not to mention the psychoanalytic/dynamic tradition general lack of empirical soundness."
5,Good band all black,Good band. The strap that connects the watch is a dark blue though so not 100% black band.
1,Not a Timex band,"The description makes this item seem as though it is a real timex band. Instead I got some cheap ripoff that is nothing like the original. When I tried to return it, The Watchband Store would not respond to my emails. They also did not respond to my emails asking about the whereabouts of the order after two weeks. Fortunately Amazon refunded the purchase price to me, but I would not order from this company if I were you!UPDATE: They have since changed the description to be more accurate..."
3,"Works, but ugly.","The band fits. A bit of a hassle to attach. It works, but I'm thinking I might just buy a new watch because its ugly."
1,Does not fit Schutt Recruit Hybrid,"This seller has the following copy ""Fits the Youth DNA Pro+, DNA Recruit, Recruit Hybrid +, and Recruit Hybrid."" This facemask does not fit Recruit Hybrid helmets .. checked with Schutt. You must order DNA face guards"
1,Does Not Fit DNA Pro + Helmet,This facemask was purchased to be placed on a youth small Schutt DNA Pro + helmet. The description says it will fit this helmet. It doesn't fit. It's too small. The quality of the product is good.
1,Does not fit recruit hybrid,"The seller shipped this very quickly. However, it came missing a screw. More importantly, it did NOT fit the schutt hybrid recruit as claimed in the description. It is much too small. Our helmet is a size youth medium so perhaps this would fit one of the smaller helmets. We ordered this in navy and the quality seems great. It is unfortunate that we will have to send it back."
4,simple and functional,There is not much to say about this product. It is what it is. It is simple and functional. Seems to be well made.
4,Did it's job.,"Works fine, wish it was lighter. It's not super heavy, but maybe if it was lighter it can actually attach to my laptop screen."
3,Does some of what it promises...,"Helpful with discoloration from darkening polishes.Applications are to be on five minutes. If your cuticles are hard or thick, that won't do it. Perhaps if it is used more than once each week, it might prove to work better.Will update review as I continue to try to work with this product."
2,I wish I had more stars,"These people are a nice company, happy to send you regular email with interesting news, but I was a little disappointed by the end product as compared to what I make, or the Habitant Pea Soup available in New England as well as Quebec.Still I have only made one batch, and it is, certainly, a fair go."
1,electroretard,This attempt fails. 604 was much better. Thought I was listening to a junked up Stacey Q on a few tracks. Not good.
2,It is alright,This disk was selling well so I wanted to see what the interest was and I found it so-so. I don't really listen to it now that I have it.
5,New old stuff...,"As was 604, this Ladytron album picks up music where 1987 abandonned it and makes it grow again. Although Ladytron is a very electro band, they're sound is new and very solidly based.In comparison to 604, I'd say that this album goes deeper into true electronic music. Learning to enjoy this kind of stuff isn't natural for a rocker like me but seems very easy with a sound as awesome as Ladytron's.I can't get this CD out of my head. All the songs just stick. A must have for any DJ or anyone looking for new great stuff."
2,is it cold in here or its it just me?,"Less catchy than the tunes on their first, and pretty much the same kind of nod toward the 80's.Same bleeps, same girl singing montone while another one rants in Bulgarian, all through a vocorder.Hey I was there in the 80's, I love all that old stuff so don't get me wrong. But if they don't find a new angle on this sound after two wholel albums of this, they will turn into a Deiter/Sprockets/ parody"
4,Somewhat sparse but listenable techno-pop,"My first impression of this CD was that this is in some sense Kraftwerk meets Tom Tom Club -- with an almost Bananarama (!) influence on some of the vocals. Further listening makes me want to say Ladytron has a rather distinctive if not totally original sound all their own. Nobody probably remembers it, but this album's beats and general slightly dark mood reminded me for some reason of John Foxx's ""Metamatic"" (1980; he of Ultravox fame). The BPM's are probably too low to qualify this album for club/dance status and they went against the current trend of over-layering way too much techno/electronica type sounds on the tracks. The CD is uniformly good throughout with no really weak songs, but also no truly superlative songs -- a couple of them almost make it there. I basically liked it and have recommended it to friends who I thought might also."
4,"hey now, this is good!","I too was a little surprised at the hostile reviews for this album. I believe it to be a natural progression to Ladyton's art... and a much better CD overall than their debut. It isn't a direct 80's-style retread, but the influences are definitely there.It isn't a perfect album, but then again, neither is ""604""... this is why its so nice to have a CD burner. I just take my favorite tracks from both and compile my own 80-minute Ladytron mix. Problem solved.Best tracks: ""True Mathematics,"" ""Seventeen,"" ""Flicking Your Switch,"" ""Evil,"" ""NuHorizons."""
2,"Hey Ladytron, Enough Reverb!!!","A very disappointing sophomore effort.They seem to be working too much off of a nonexistent formula.Instead of just making music that they would like to, they listened to their last album on loop and started to duplicate it.I'd also like to hear the singer's voice! Too much hissy reverb!We get it! Now show us something else!3 great songs Max!"
3,Prejudiced,Hardly anything new here. Author is very prejudiced against McCartney and Harrison. Very much against Linda and just loves Oko. Oko must have paid him off. Better books available than this one. Has good early historical information befoe Beatles became famous.
3,On the Other Hand...,"Okay, so the author went and did some observations of random children between the ages of 2 and 3 and then wrote this book to explain the children's general behaviours to parents for better insight. Ummm, okay. It didn't really offer much definitive advice or anything, and just when you think the author is trying to offer some on a general subject (for instance, imagination skills), then she turns around and tells you that some kids are different. So while she's trying to calm all parents concerns about their child's development by relating to the whole reading audience, she loses her point in writing the book. I could've written this book if I hung out with a bunch of different kids in their home environments. I didn't find it helpful at all, but I did find the kids in the book were adorable. I wouldn't recommend this to someone with a 2 year old. Maybe I would if the parent has a child that is coming on 2 years, as a general guideline of what's to come."
4,Fast Food Nation,"Fast Food Nation chronicles the history of what have become today's largest and most successful fast food chains. He uncovers the dark secrets that lie behind the ""all-american meal""Schlosser does a great job of keeping the reader entertained with interesting facts and he makes it hard for the reader to put the book down. This being Schlosser's first book is acutely reminiscant of Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"" it takes a direct look at meat packing plants and tells us ""why the fries taste so good."" After reading this book, the reader may or may not have a hard time even looking at fast food restaurants."
4,Over and out,"Just read this book and I'm done with fast food, due to both its' effects on my health and the effects of the fast food industry on society as a whole. I realize this is not a review of the book, but look at it this way: someone who happily consumed cheap burgers, fries, fried chicken and tacos decided to stop after reading this book. Think there might be something to it?"
5,THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BOOK!,"This has got to be one of the most important books I've read since I finished MAD COWBOY. Read this one, pass it around, tell everyone you know about it and then write your congressman! This is a book that will change your perspective and demand that you act, because doing nothing would be worse than a crime especially where the basic rights of workers in this country are concerned."
4,want some fries with that?,"I enjoyed this book. I'm sure most people, even while enjoying a fast-food meal, suspected that it might not be exactly ""kosher"". That part of the book wasn't much of a surprise. What I really enjoyed, was reading about the meat industry, the demise of family farms and the demise of union influence. Reading about the way the employess are treated in the meat industry was very disturbing to say the least. The story of ""hank"" and his family ranch, was heartbreaking. I enjoyed reading about the hard-working guys who originally started some of these fast-food restaurants many years ago. I think this book was a very good read!"
5,Lose Weight Now! Read this book.,"If nothing else - this book will make you more aware of the food you put in your mouth. Never again knowing what you know will you want to walk into McD's or the BK, stare the poor underpaid help in the face and shove that food down your throat. You'll demand things like decent nutrition and that the people who wait on you are treated like you would want to be treated. This book will change your thinking. If nothing else - it will wake you up to the Fast Food Nation around you."
5,We eat this?,"After reading this book, I'd read anything that Eric Schlosser wrote, because this guy does his research. If there is any information on the modern American eating habits, and the contents of our food, and the manufacturing of it, he checked it out. He looks at the history of fast food, an extremely American invention."
1,Uninspiring and unfounded,"Sure, this book might strike any reader as chockful of ""facts"" and background research--but when a journalist starts to draw wild paralells between fast food and the life-long disenchantment of America's workers, between fast food and the rate of high-school drop-outs, and holding the fast food chains responsible for all and any negative socio-economic developments in the US since World War II, I can only begin to wonder whether Schlosser is even familiar with the concept of ""argument by scenario"" (telling a story that links unrelated incidents and situations and then pointing to the story itself as proof that the various conditions are related).Having greatly anticipated reading Schlosser's work, it left me nothing but greatly disappointed. The basis for both his arguments and his conclusions are often so weak and far-fetched that I can do nothing but shake my head in disapproval."
3,Where's The Beef?,"Interesting enough, as far as it goes. If you really care about fast food and really want to spend some time thinking about it, this might interest you. But then, we all sort of knew that fast food is a huge industry that exploits its labor and creates unhealthy food and has changed the face of the U.S. There's not much new here. Just kind of reinforces what we all knew anyway. Schlosser has done his homework. The research and interviews are impressive, but really, it's just a story about junk food. Where's the beef?"
4,Talk about Fast Food,This book sure did the trick in changing my mind about Fast food and not wanting it anymore.
5,This book was great.,"I bought FFN a few months ago and I consider it to be one of the best reads of my life. This book provoked thoughts of horror and awe that I will never forget. The best part about this book was the multitudes of interesting facts that could be used as conversation topics. This is due to the fact that we are truly in a fast food nation. Not one person in this country wouldn't want to hear how many french fries are produced for the western states alone, and when you tell them how much, they are blown away. FFN is a book that will blow you away, and will make you look at the Fast Food Institution in a whole different way."
3,gross fast food,"Fast Food Nation definitely gets its point across to readers. It seems almost impossible that a person who eats fast food or most meat in general could read this book and then not at least think twice before ordering the next time. However, I did think that the majority of the book fit into one of two categories. Either the information seemed off topic or it was full of repulsive, bloody details."
5,"""Eat This, President Bush""","I cannot add more to all of the other excellent reviews written here about this book, except to say that, as the expression goes, ""If you're not outraged, you are not paying attention!"" Being a physician, I have recommended this book to my patients on countless occasions, not only to enhance their education about nutritional diets, but to also see the connections between Corporate America, politics, and economics, and that Americans can no longer stay in their comfy little bubble of ignorance concerning not only their health, but their lack of involvement in the political process. I cannot recommend this book enough. A GREAT EYE OPENER.Linda E. Dewey, M.D."
4,ape impressions,"An excellent book for someone like myself who works with teens and supervises the diet of four of my own children who are all under the age of 8. It is the modern day version of Sinclair's ""The Jungle"", although at times I wished the author did not spend so much time on side issues (such as labor issues at meatpacking plants) that only indirectly pertain to the fast food industry. I enjoyed learning about these periferial issues, but I was hungering (no pun intended) for more meat (no pun intended) related to the ill effects of fast food on society."
3,"Interesting, but read carefully","This is an interesting in depth analyses of how the fast food industry has infiltrated every aspect of our society. However, read it carefully. The author mixes various economic supply chain efficiencies with unethical business practices and bunches them all together in one big scornful shame. The fact that this particular industry has reduced friction of the supply chain through standardization, economies of scale, automation and high tech systems seems problematic to him. He intermingles these things with the lack of government regulation in the industry and how these corporations exploit the uneducated masses. He seems very pro-government and anti-business in many cases, but not always."
4,"fast, fun and informative","Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation is a book that I couldn't put down. It provides an explicit encapsolation of modern America by uncovering how and what we eat. The prose are concise and fluid. The content is as informative as it is disturbing, and I reccomend it to every fast-food-eating-American."
3,Not What I Expected,"This is a very well written and documented book. However, the media portrayed it as an assault on the fast food industry. Aside from the first and last chapters of the book, the fast food industry was barely mentioned. Rather, this book takes an in-depth look at food production in general, and the meat-packing industry in specific. The author scratches the surface of hiring practices among fast food companies, but the practice of hiring teenagers and the elderly is hardly restricted to fast food joints--check out any retail outlet and temp agency in America. They are all preying upon people who are willing to accept slave labor, and since there are an abundance of such people, we all suffer. Overall, the book is worth reading, but be prepared for detailed reading. Seriously, I don't know very many people who will read this book cover-to-cover."
2,Check your expectations before buying this book,"I purchased this book fully expecting to be convicted on my fast food habits and to be significantly turned off to ever eating it again after I finished reading. Instead, I found the book to be poorly organized and the information barely convincing. In fact,the most damning evidence was against all the suppliers of the fast food industry, the same companies who supply everyone from grocery stores to schools. In fact,he(Eric) even states several times that fast food restaurants obtain the best quality meat available, due to their massive buying volume and leverage.Further, the author himself said ""Even 'Fast Food Nation' did not revolutionize my eating habits"".(Organic Style,May/June 2003)I was disappointed in the book, but perhaps my expectations were too high based on all the rave reviews I heard since it came out. Mike"
5,Frightening Truths,"Schlosser's exposé of the fast food industry makes for terrifying reading. Now that I am aware of the appalling corporate trade practices, I have been sure to avoid McDonald's (except in order to get hold of the complete Happy Meal collections of Hannah Montana and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles- the mantelpiece would have seemed bare without them). However, it is equally worrying to learn about the produce found in major supermarkets. Chicken is frequently known to contain as much as 40% additives. If you ask me, 'chicken' should be just that and it should NOT involve added protein. It is for this reason that I must politely decline Uncle Bruce's invitations to dinner. Since I caught a glimpse of him through the kitchen window (during the final throes of 'injecting' a chicken) I have felt little urge to join him for a Sunday dinner."
4,A Little Something for Everyone,"Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation may be light reading, but it stills covers the darkest of the dark about the All-American meal. Do you know what happens to the cow before it enters your mouth? Do you know what happens to the people? Maybe you don't really want to know. Maybe all you want to know is how fast food started; maybe you just want a little chuckle when you realize what fast food corporations are really about; maybe you want to know why your child is so into fast food. As for me, I appreciated being reminded of what the business world is really willing to do to make some money."
5,Everyone Must Read,"I purchased this book about 4 years ago and read it in 2 days. Everyone should read this book. (There is even a version for children.) I have since purchased many copies for family and friends. I have completely stopped eating fast food, and now read labels on all products. This book is an eye opener to the food industry, and how our dollars effect our whole culture."
5,No More McD's!,"If this book has done anything for me, it has made me dislike fast food. Which is a good thing for my weight...A college professor recommended this book, and he mentioned that those who read it would have a different mindset about fast food chains. At the time I thought: ""Yeah, right!"" But, I was intrigued and decided to read it. Well, it's true! I may not completely avoid fast food, but I will certainly never eat another chain burger.Furthermore, I would now like to read more books on this vast industry. To be fair, I will still read the ""other"" side..."
4,Yikes!!,I had no idea the fast food industry was this scary! I think I will think twice before ordering that burger at the place down the road!
5,A MUST-READ FOR EVERYONE,"Excellent, excellent, excellent! A very in-depth look at some troubling issues in the U.S.. Eric Schlosser does a great job putting the pieces of an ugly puzzle into place. This book isn't even out yet and already i am recommending it to everyone. (I was able to get ahold of an uncorrected proof)If you eat, you NEED to read this book."
5,Fast Food Culture,"Fast Food Nation is an eye opening book. It delves into nearly every imaginable aspect of the fast food industry and its impact not only on a nation but a global scale. From the birth of the industry in Southern California, a region that has historcally through the twentieth century been associated with optimism for the future, for dreams, for possibilities, to the bloody slaughter houses that endanger the lives of those who not only work at them but also those who eat the food processed at them, Schlosser's book is through. The pictures inspire compassion and disgust, sympathy and fear. As emotionally powerful in some parts as it is politically controversial in others Fast Food Nation was an enjoyable read."
4,Classic Mucraker,"This is a book written like a classic Muckraker. I was thinking of Upton sinclair the whole time.I enjoyed all the economics and history behind the story. I see the author's premise and disputes with the entire fast food business.The only thing I disagree with is his view about the corporations explotiations of children, I mean by marketing to them. he doesn't address enough parental responsibility in my view.If you'd like to hear about some of the inner workings of the fastfood industry this is it. If you'd just like to stay blind and keep eating the stuff...don't read this"
4,Interesting read,"Interesting read, and somewhat different from my initial expectations. I was somewhat worried this would turn out to be yet another book focused on the ""evil"" nutritional effects of fast foods, and delighted to find out this isn't that kind of book. It is based on the history and social development of the fast food industry, and the way these have helped shape America (and to some extent, much of the western world)."
5,Review,This book is one of the best book i have ever read. It will open your mind about all the things that happen in Fast Food restaurant. For all of the poeple that eat fast-food you better brace your self because after you read this book you are going to be vegeterian. You also are going to read about how employeesget treated and things they have to go through.
4,Book needed for class,This was a book that was necessary for a class in Economics for my son. It was good to get a decent used book at a reasonable price. It was shipped promptly.
2,So So,"I expected more information on the ""current"" state of food cleanliness, not a book report on the history of the food industry."
5,Worth your money and time.,"This is a great piece of journalism/literature. The material presented in the book is readable and goes by fast. Without this book I would not go out and research the subject of fast food on my own. I neither have the time or talent to do so. The history of the fast food industry is truely amazing and its a shame that good old American values can also be an evil thing. Yes, low prices are good but is it worth risking our health, I don't think so.I learned how the power of the fast food industry influences the meatpacking industry, the ""flavorizing"" of products, American culture, and abusive practices that are performed from the corporate headquarters to the slaughterhouses. Definitely a must-read."
3,Eye Opener,"I found this book to be an eye opener. If you've ever wondered about where the ingredients from that combo meal that you munched on came from, this book is a good start. Its quite clear that a lot of research went into the writing of this book and since Schlosser doesnt hold back on any of the details, I found some of the information in here shocking. He also covers the history of institutions that are shaping the fast food industry today and includes detailed examples to make solid points. Overall a good read for the curious fast food consumer."
4,You'll never eat fast food again...,"After just three chapters of this book, my New Year's resolution is to learn to cook so my husband doesn't have to do it all the time. We know fast food places advertise to our children, but it's more glaring in the black and white. I don't know that I will ever be able to set foot in a fast food place again. This is definitely a good book to read if you have any curiousity about the industry at all."
3,Educational and Interesting,"What a book! I enjoyed the history that involved not only fast food but much more of America including a little about the railways, highways, Disney, and so many occupations out there involved in making food that I didn't even realize. The first half of the book mesmerized me and kept me very eager to read more.BUT - I don't like the obvious Democrat flair and anti-Christian remarks. This book is very biased and puts down former presidents Ronald Regan and George Bush while making Clinton look like a victim of the Republican majority.... There is a lot of political jargon here, and though I can see how it deeply influences the meat packing industry, I would have rather read an unbiased set of facts.I did enjoy this book despite its flaws, and I am much more conscious of what my family is eating. It is alarming how much processed food is out there - and even more alarming is our naveté to it."
4,You'll think about a lot of things after reading this one,"I expected the book to be about the detrimental health effects of eating fast food, but that was just one of the topics. The book comprehensively covers the entire spectrum of the fast food industry, as well as food processing in a more general sense. While the author sometimes seems to over-simplify the issues by laying the blame at the feet of fast food executives motivated only by greed, his best point was that we consumers cannot continue to blindly trust the companies that put food in front of us, no matter how good the french fries taste. Of course the industry wants to make money -- that's not the problem. The problem is how we consumers encourage bad behavior by never questioning how they make the money. How many 99-cent items have to be on the menu before you question who's really losing out on the deal?"
5,"More like ""[bad] Meal""","Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation has given me a completely new view of the fast food industry. The book was fantastic - well written, fact filled, entertaining, and most of all, shocking. I had no idea what was going on behind the closed doors of fast food companies across the country. I was semi-vegetarian before I read this book, but now there is no doubt in my mind as to my ideas on eating meat. The book was at times almost too much to read, (and I admit I skipped over the account of a meatpacking worker getting his head jammed in a beef pulverizer) but overall, it was thought provoking and extremely interesting. I reccomend it to everyone."
4,You suspected that fast food was evil. Now you know why!,"In this book, Schlosser describes how fast food chains have transformed our culture in the last half century or so.His interesting writing style weaves statistics, history, personal interest stories and cultural commentary into a quite compelling comment on how industry titans use their power to addict us to their products, trick us into buying them, stamp out unions, grease the political wheels, abuse workers, and avoid regulation and accountability. As bad as that sounds, this book also makes it clear that this couldn't happen without our participation. And in that regard the whole insidious process, although ""bad"", also seems to be the inevitable manifestation of our societal values - our own chickens coming home to roost, if you will."
4,Eye Opening,"After reading the book, I became so appalled at the thought of eating fast food again. It's not just about health either. The sad and horrific stories about how factory workers were treated and their working conditions will wake you up. One often knows how bad fast food is, but until you read this, you won't really know just how BAD it is."
1,A extremly badly written rant,"This book came higky recommended, but has been a complete dissapointment. Schlosser rambles on without clearly stating anything, using unrelated data to create impressions of wrong doing. He is extremly naive in his view of the world - for example, should it come as a surprise to anyone that a corporation would attempt to stop a unionization drive???!!! He highlights major sucess stories, gives little credit to men who have created icons, yet does not even build a coherant case to demonstrate that what thye have done may not be good.To all those with a an analytic bent, stay away ... regardless of your political beliefs."
1,Regurgitated information...,"I really do hate books written by journalist's. Most of them regurgitate someone elses words and this book is no different. I decided against my better judgement to buy this book based on two friends recommendations... and now they are going to pay me back for the hours i spent reading this book! The book is written in a logical flowing manner... but i found myself blanking out through huge sections of the book... ""blah blah blah... The houses seem not to have been constructed by hand but manufactured by some gigantic machine... blah blah blah... mcdonalds...blah blah blah soviet bombers... blah blah blah...USDA... blah blah blah... "" Honestly... it didn't turn me off fast food- i enjoy being a part of the masses- a consumer... i enjoy marketing strategies and how ingenious they are... in fact i think i will go enjoy some e.coli 0157:h7 topped with some shigella between two sesame buns right now!"
1,Not a good experience....,"Not going well at all, have not received the book, and have not heard back from the sell on where it is or if and when I will receive it.Ordered the book on January 20th, 2009, and as of February 20th no word..."
1,Fast Food Nation,"I am not happy at all! As of today, May 18, 2010 I have not recieved this item! I ordered it the week before it was needed for a class discussion (ordered on April 16), figuring it would arrive in plenaty of time. My daughter's classs has finished the book and is testing over it this week... and guess what? She hasn't even read the book!This is the second purchase, back to back, I have made that has NEVER arrived. I am STILL waiting on a gift for my twins that was ordered the first week of December as a Christmas gift! I will probably not be ordering thru Amazon again!"
1,VERY MISLEADING,"This book was not written by an objective journalist. Schlosser is about as left-wing as one can get. I purchased this book hoping to learn about the fast-food industry and it's practices, not to be repeatedly subjected to one man's liberal opinion. Save your money."
3,Wanders,"I thought this book was going to be mostly about fast food resaurants, but it turns out that it's mostly about society in the wake of the rise of fast food restaurants. It was a good book, but the author seemed to get side-tracked often, kind of thinking about different matters while writing."
2,overcooked,"i purchased this book hoping for an interesting dissection of the world of fast food... essentially, i finished it because i bought it, not because i was captivated.. here's some advice when reading it...go to the last chapter. it is at this point that the true nature of the author emerges. otherwise, this was a total bore. file under: ""could have been a nice leaflet"""
4,Flawed Fast Food Feature,"Fast Food Nation is an intriguing look at the fast food industry--its food, servers and impact on society. I learned a lot about the history of the various fast food chains, the founders of the restaurants and their growth, but the most important part of the book is the examination of the dark side of fast food. Some reviewers of the book refer to Schlosser as a modern day Upton Sinclair, but the writing is no where near as persuasive or moving. The style is more like a John McPhee essay in that there are incredible details, interesting anecdotes and it moves in all sorts of interesting directions, but unfortunately it isn't always convincing. Yes, the fast food industry has serious flaws, but the book is often so biased that Schlosser ignores other potential causes of the problems he cites and this makes the book less effective. This book is provacative and well written, so I would certainly recommend it its alarmist content and tone should be taken with a grain of salt."
4,Knowing more about the fast food industry,"As I am a food lover, I was very interested in reading this book. Even though I got a little bit bored starting from the middle of it, I think the author does a very good job on researching and investigating the fast food industry. All of the facts and information in this book give me a clear and detail picture of the hidden problems that exist in many of the fast food restaurants. However, my main dislike about this book is there are too many facts rather than the author's opinions. I believe the book would be more interesting if the author put more his feelings and thoughts in it. Although most of us know fast food is not good for us, there are some hidden aspects that we don't really know. Therefore, whether you like or dislike fast food, I think you should consider reading this book because fast food is directly related to our lives and it can affect our lives in both good and bad ways."
3,"MMMmm, fattening..","Before the movie Super-Size Me, there was Fast Food Nation. Great read. Now, originally I thoughgt this was going to be the book that turned me off from fast food for good, with disgusting descriptions like chicken mcnuggets were really pigeon mcnuggets, but that is not the case. This book looks at the history of fast food from a road side start-up into the multi-billion dollar fat factory it has become. It looks at how they get the food to you and how they financially make it possible to serve an entire meal for $3.99. My favorite lesson from this book - chicken mcnuggets are fried in beef stock oil. Hence why I can never make chicken nuggets at home that taste so full of greasy goodness!***1/2Check out all my reviews at michaelslibrary.blogspot - dotcom!"
2,Heavy-handed,"I went in expecting to read an insightful accountof how fast food has effected our nation and the world. What I got instead was a heavy handed argument against development. I can respect the opinion of the author, as it well founded, but he dismisses the possibility that eh could be wrong, even finding surprise in the fact that there are people who could be happy with suburban growth. I had to throw this book down every few minutes in disgust. Just wading through the biased and self-satisfied jargon to the end was enough to make me want a burger."
4,Fries with That?,"This is an extremely important book for all Americans to read. It is not just an updated ""The Jungle,"" filled with page after page of details (although there is certainly some stomach-churning stuff in there). What this book is is a balanced, wide-ranging social history of all the facets associated with the fast food industry: automobile culture, the advertising industry's turn to children as targets, teenage work, migrant labor, the obese-ing of America, etc. The complete picture that emerges is of entire country's lifestyle gone wrong. The complex of factors that leads us to eat too much, to eat the wrong things, to exploit slaughterhouse and fast-food workers, to turn our land into strip-malls, and to treat living animals as assembly-line commodities must be overturned. It will be a virtually impossible task, but the first step is being aware of the problems. This book will jump-start our awareness."
4,The utterly Fascinating and knowledgeable,Scholosser gets very deep into the book about talking about fast foods. He's not telling to stop eating it just be open minded and make sure what is in your food.
4,Fast Food Nation,"This bbok made me seriously consider becoming a vegetarian. If you want to remain a meat-eater, I'd suggest not reading it. If, on the other hand, you like to be informed about the food you're eating at McDonald's and Burger King, you should read this very carefully. This book has some amazing similarities to Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"", and that was written in the early 20th century! Apparently, we haven't come too far. This book really opened my eyes to the world of fast food, and I'd suggest it to anyone who wants to be as informed as I have become."
4,great expose,"Do not read this book if you can't live without McDonalds. This book gets to the bottom, and mostly disgusting details of the fast food industry in this country. It is not for those with weak stomachs. For example: there is a section on the worst jobs in America (like those who clean up the slaughterhouses).If you read this book and still frequent McD's, Burger King, or any of the other places mentioned in it...I don't know whether to congratulate you or smack you upside the head.This book should be required reading for the entire nation. How long are we going to simply comment on the obesity epidemic instead of actually doing something about it?"
5,An excellent book,"An interesting and enlightening read. Although this book is ostensibly about fast food, the issues it broaches can be applied to many aspects of today's economy."
5,Well-Researched Expose,"I really enjoyed this book. I believe the author Eric Schlosser did an excellent job of research. To wit, despite all the revelations he has made in this book, no one has sued him, because he can back it all up.Too, I was relieved that this book did not go downhill into a pro-vegetarian rant. Schlosser calls for reforms in the way meat is processed but does not call for an end to meat eating. That would be like throwing the baby out with the bath water."
4,"A good read, sure, BUT....","I appreciate the light shed on an undoubtedly shady industry, but allow me, as a chef with 12 years experience, to enlighten you: It's not just fast food. Sure, fast food places are more likely to be scummy than traditional restaurants, but you could be exposed to the same dangers there. Who's to say your favorite Italian joint around the corner doesn't have a shady purveyor? How do you know the cooks back there are clean people? You think Outback steak houses get their beef from some magical farm with miles and miles of grazing land? Wrong. Do you know how many Outbacks there are? Same growth hormones, pal. Same corn that the animals can't even digest, which is why we give them antibiotics in the first place. What I'm saying is this: It all depends on your crew and on your suppliers, and while I appreciate the author's research, I found the book a tad alarmist."
4,"Welcome to ""The Jungle""","The author definitely has an agenda, no two ways about it, and as a political conservative I squirmed more than a few times at what seemed to be a blanket indictment against the Republican party, but as a human being I could not help but be affected by this book. The second part, especially, detailing the horrible conditions at meat-processing plants is certainly an eye-opener, reminiscent of Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"", written in 1906. This book, if nothing else, is eduational. Especially interesting to me was the chapter about the New Jersey chemical companies that develop formulas that make fast food taste and smell the way it does, totally in the chemical realm. There is also some interesting, if not comprehensive, fast-food history here. Unfortunately, one thing this book did not do is stop me from eating at fast food places. Excuse me, I think I'll go grab a Big Mac."
4,Changes one's views on fast food,"I feel that Eric Schlosser did a very good job at conveying to the reader his opinion of the fast food industry. He takes the reader through the history of the fast food industry. He describes the trials early pioneers faced and the pleasures of success. I believe that most of the facts presented in his book are factual, but as you read you begin to doubt some of his statistics. He is a very good story teller and I enjoyed reading the book from beginning to end, however, I don't believe that I will be able to look at fast food the same way ever again. After reading this book one begins to wonder how much we, as the consumers, dont know about what we eat every day. It has a slow beginning but is a great story the whole way through. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever wondered about what they are really unwrapping and eating. Enjoy."
4,Disgusting Yet Very Interesting,I learned a great deal out of this well written book by Eric Schlosser. Everything written is interesting although it is sometimes disturbing. Ever wonder what you're eating at McDonald's? Find out by reading this book!
1,Mislead,"I thought that this book was a sequel to ""Fast Food Nation"" since it was titled P.S.. Instead, I got the old book in a new package. I feel deceived. I have already read this book and was hoping to get new information, updated. If I had wanted to buy the original book, published back in 2002, I would have bought one for one cent on the secondary market."
3,There's poo-poo in the cow sandwich!,"Hamburgers come from cows. Chicken sandwiches are made out of chickens. French fries are potatoes fried in grease. These and many more startling facts are uncovered in Eric Schlosser 's ""Fast Food Nation""... If you eat a lot of burgers and fries, and you're feeling sick and overweight and don't know why... read this book. Otherwise, you might flip through it to read the gross parts just for fun.."
2,Fast Food,Fast Food Nation gives the reader an idea of how the fast food chain works. It gives life experiences of people that work in the fast food industry and how they were treated. It also gives facts of what's in the meat that we eat in restaurants. But overall it's an okay book.
2,Fast Food Nation,"I found lots of the information very interesting. However, Mr Schlosser showed his lack of understanding concerning the American consumer. His claims of profit motive only ignore the realities of our American economic behavior. The American consumer DEMANDS, PRICE, PRICE, PRICE. Any firm wishing to be successfull, McDonalds or anyone else, has to cater to the American unwillingness to pay. The mass market in this country wants everything from gasoline to food for pennies, ignoring value. How can any firm pay living wages, when the buying public will run to the shop down the street to save a nickle? Our retail society only knows how to compete based on price. Lower retails demand lower costs, whether it be labor or ingrediants. The retail industry and its suppliers are only giving the American people what they demand. I think the blame wasn't spread around to all the right places in this book."
2,"Good info, but...","I am a fairly intelligent person, but I found this book extremely hard to read. It seemed to have good, well researched information, but boring, boring, boring."
2,didn't amaze me,"although the book did have great details, it was so incredibly boring that it was difficult to read. some chapters held interest much more than others, but still there were a few parts that made you want to kill yourself. i did get into it after about 150 pages, but before that it was absolutely awful."
1,A hard stretch for facts.,"Fast Food Nation, unlike the Big Mac at McDonalds is hard to swallow. Eric Schlosser tries to associate everything from armed robbery to political bombings, to the spread of a particular strain of Escherichia Coli with fast food companies. He did this with lame anecdotes and an over-abundance of fuzzy facts, all while trying to push his political agenda. Eric Schlosser tries to become the Upton Sinclair of the 21st century by demonizing the meat-packing companies. Although he might have some valid points about sanitary conditions and lack of inspectors, he negates those with over-the-top stories of meat-packing and fast food workers."
1,Leftist Propaganda Slop,"The first red flag went up when Schlosser mentioned the formation of the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang coinciding with the founding of McDonalds in San Bernadino, CA. The first real FACT (that was not ubiquitous common knowledge) appeared about page 119. Schlosser spends most of this book decrying the woeful state of affairs in capitalist America. Most of what he has to say has nothing whatever to do with the evils of fast food. Karl Marx would be proud."
2,Disappointing.,"I must admit, I was excited to read this book, thinking it would be something like 'Super Size Me.' However, as I progressed through the book, I became more and more disappointed. It starts off with details that I found, had nothing to do with fast food. As it continues, the fast food portion comes in bit by bit. The parts that tell about the slaughterhouses, and the ingredients in the food did interest me, but there was little of that. I also felt that the book was entirely one-sided. The points about minorities are true, but to me, it sounded as if the author was saying that only minorities and teenagers make up the fast food nation. Don't get me wrong, teenagers and minorities do make up the majority of the working population at fast food restaurants, but when it comes to customers, I think all races and ages make up the fast food nation."
1,There's too much and not enough to this book...,"For anyone that is thinking about reading this book, because you are going to follow in the coat-tails of so many that have already, I say to you, if you do not want jargan and enough figures to make your head ache, then don't bother.While the book does repersent an O.K. study of the ""fast food"" industry, this book is probally not what the average reader thinks it is. It is filled with senseless numbers, statements, and terms that will make the average reader lose interest or pretend that they understand everything.This book is one of which many people won't finish, or will stuggle though to have that accomplishment. I say this, because this book is not leasure reading, and is even heavy with figures and data for a unprofessional journal.Whoever is out there looking for a book to read about the fast-food industry, and all the sick attributes that go along with it, look for another book or go work for one."
1,An Unorganized Rip-off,"This guy didn't bother to organize himself before he put pen to paper. The book is chaotic, filled with anecdotes instead of facts, and drips with the author's apparent communistism. A total waste of money."
2,I still will not eat the fast food.,"I usually never eat the fast food, especially MacDonalds because it taste no good. This book expalins not only the process of the production but behind the fast food business scene, which makes this book interesting. Schlosser did lots of reserch to create the fast food business, which made MacDonalds the king of the fast food chain. And for example he explains the secrets of his success such as why the French fris tastes so good, etc.However he states only the bright side, and not the dark side. For me it is a little sharrow. I wish he had gone deeper.But after all this book does not convince me to eat at MacDonalds."
1,JUST MORE LIBERAL HOGWASH AND HALF-TRUTHS,"Well, this is an interesting book. But I must say...God Bless the Fast Food Industry! It represents all that is great with this country. If you don't like fast food maybe you should leave America or are a Communist. Even EUROPEANS love our American fast food, fancy French restaurants are going out of business because the French know a good thing when they see it and can't get enough Big Macs. Books like this are just wrong they say fast food is unhealthy and evil my brother eats nothing but fast food he's 39 and healthy as a horse. I think Schlosser must be jealous of fast food success and that's why he wrote this book. How sad.You can go ahead and click ""Not Helpful"" but by doing so you're admitting that I'm right and it scares you so much that you feel the need to censure me in some way. Go ahead, I am used to attacks by liberal nancy-boys.Final ratings - 1 out of 5 stars."
3,Umm...,"This book is half page-turner, half (to borrow a friend's term) snoozefest. The very thing that makes the book a powerful commentary on American life - Schlosser's vast knowledge of the history and impact of the fast food industry - also serves to make this book, largely, incredibly boring. While those who are politically aware and active may find interest in the battles between corporations, unions, farmers, etc. that are mentioned - and while English majors and other heavy readers may devote themselves to the effort of slogging through the book's 288 pages of narrated history lessons - this book does not seem like the kind that would hold an average reader captivated. Readers should note that the chapter ""The Most Dangerous Job"" is not for the faint of heart / stomach. That being said, the book is darkly insightful and worth the read if you can deal with the boring parts."
4,EWWWWWWWWW,"This is one of those books you hate to love. The reason is simple, if you enjoy a hamburger, you enjoy it less after learning the ""truth"" about it. Schlosser did the same with this book that The Jungle and Diet for a New America did towards convincing one to become a vegetarian."
3,"Initially Interesting, but Loses its Way","Schlosser gets off to a good start, weaving a fascinating history of the fast food industry. The origins or McDonalds, Carl's Junior, KFC, and others provided a brief and interesting snapshot of the social evolution of post-WWII America. Schlosser is effective in connecting the dots between the family automoble and the life-style changes that made fast food a truly American culture. But beyond there, he tries too hard to vilify the industry, and to politicize the topic. While there likely are excesses and abuses in this business, I doubt that many have ever considered ""fast food"" a pillar of industrial virtue, leaving the reader underwhelmed in the ""truth"" Schlosser's reveals. (You mean a slaughter house is an unpleasant place to work! Gasp! And people even may get hurt there! Oh my God!)Perhaps we've all become too calloused since the muckraking hayday of Upton Sinclair to care anymore."
5,An Excellent Read,"I think everyone in America should read this book. It is an excellent account of the rise of fast food in America. It gives you a behind the scenes look at the quality of the food served at fast food chains, the corporate stronghold, the meatpacking industry, and many other insights into the business. The impact of fast food on our society and others is huge. The book was thought provoking and has definitely changed my viewpoint about eating fast food. America has to rethink it's eating habits, and eliminating fast food will certainly make all the difference in the world."
5,"Eye opening, cutting edge journalism that educates you!","This is an incredible book about not only the fast food business and its effects on all aspects on the economy and society but a look at the hidden costs that we all pay as a society thru this cultural movement of eating and living on fast food. This book shocks a person when you read about the innocent people who are injured or have their lives destroyed by working at slaugherhouses with dangerous conditions. However, the book also tells the amazing stories of how ordinary men launched fast food empires with American ingenuity and persistance and hard work."
5,More than meets the eye.,"I bought this book in a London airport bookstore, as something that looked moderately interesting to kill time on my flight. I found that this book was much more than I expected. Rather than just gross-out facts on why one should avoid fast food, this book is amazingly well-researched and informative.What impressed me the most was Schlosser's ability to weave the human perspective into the overall sociological and economical view. This book is extremely well-worded, and is so much more than just a dryly written collection of pointless facts. This book is educational and informs the reader of the myriad ways that the rise of the fast food industry has completely changed our culture in America and throughout the world."
4,Fast Food Nation Review,"Fast Food Nation is a fairly fast paced book in which Eric Schlosser depicts the nature of the fast food industry. The book goes into the history of fast food, and how it has effected not only the American economy but other countries as well. It shows the harsh treatment of workers, as they are given no benefits and have bad working conditions as well as little pay. In addition the book explains the process of the meat from when the cows are killed to when it is served. The conditions in which the meat is packaged and clean would discourage any reader from eating at most fast food restaurants, unless of course it is In-N-Out (which is only in a few states). Fast Food Nation is definitely a worthwhile read, that will change your view of the fast food industry."
4,lots of great infromation,"Schlosser points out many issues between fast foods industry and the society. especially, I am interested in the relationship between children and the fast foods companies. the companies use tons of dollars to get children as customers every year. their strategy is unbelievable, and I was very surprised to see that in the book. Even though many people know that fast food is not good for your health, people still go there and eat the foods. if you want to know the reasons why people are attracted to the fast foods so much, you should read this book."
4,Less of a polemic than I expected,"I was sure, when I picked up this book, that it would push me back toward those years in the 70s when we all seemed to think that vegetarianism was the logical answer just about everything that was wrong with the world. So I was surprised that Eric Schlosser wasn't really pushing that philosophy; he's not truly anti-hamburger, he's just in favor of healthy hamburger. Healthy for everyone: cowboys, consumers, corporations, and even the cows.One effect of those who read Fast Food Nation will probably be a severe lessening in how mindlessly they turn into McDonald's or Burger King when hunger hits on the Interstate. Instead, you just might find yourself looking for kosher and organic meats and packing your own lunches before heading off on a trip to Disneyland.A much-needed book."
5,You are what you eat!,WOW! This book was an eye opener. I think everyone knows that fast food is bad for us but don't know why. This is an interesting look at some of the largest fast food chains. It will make you question how they get away with it and it will definitely make me make better food choices from now on!
5,Fast Fast Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal,Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal. Good book. Very enlightening! No more Mickey D's or anyone else except Jack in the Box and Inn and Out. .
4,A good read.,"This book will make you want to stop eating fast food. I know it has been said over and over again, but, it is worth saying it yet again. It is amazing to learn the devasting effects our food production system has not only upon consumers' bodies, but also upon industry employees and our natural environment.A good companion read with Omnivore's Dilemma, which focuses on veggies as opposed to Fast Food Nation's focus upon beef."
3,An Informative Read!,"Eric Schlosser wrote a very informative book about the fast food industry in these days. He evaluated the fast food industry from the very beginning to the present day. The facts and details he stated about fast food are shocking, yet somehow believable. He wrote about every aspect of the fast food industry from the horrible health facts to people's reactions to those same facts. Eric Schlosser wrote a very good book that was somewhat of a slow read, yet still a very interesting and informative book that everyone should read."
3,Alarming,"It is often alarming for me to hear statistics on how obese our nation is becoming and the effect it has had on all Americans. Eric Schlosser has given the world the opportunity to see Fast Food through a different pair of eyes. Instead of just examining the products, he studied the history of fast food; he included why it was created, why it has become so popular, and how it has changed America. He also researched the food products from start to finish so that the Nation can see why their fries taste so good. However, Schlosser did have at times, in my opinion, a tendency to make his own biases come out through his text. Even so, I think Schlosser did a great job showing how the fast food industry is transforming not only our diet but our landscape, economy, workforce and culture."
2,A little boring.... sometimes interesting.,"I picked this book up hoping that it would make me never want to eat fast food again. It did work...for awhile. I have to admit that the ease of fast food makes it hard to stay away completely.Parts of this book were very slow. Although the author at times went into painfully long detail about certain things (particularly the part about artifical flavorings), I took away a lot of knowledge about the fast food industry.I had no idea how companies like McDonalds and Pepsi are giving schools funding in exchange for advertising and selling their junky food to the students. Reading this made me sick!The book also goes into great detail about what goes on in meat packing plants. After reading this section, you'll think twice when you go to order that next hamburger.Overall, an interesting read. Unfortunately, a lot of it was slow, so for every compelling section, there was another one that would put me to sleep."
3,Fast Food Nation,"This book was basically a bunch of facts. If you are a person who can remember things well then this book might be a little more interesting to you. Personally I forget very quickly and there were too many names, places, and etc. for me to even try and memorize. The parts that I thought were interesting were about how the fast food chains came to be. As for how food is made at the restaurants, what Schlosser said is what I've always pretty much assumed. Not too many things were much of a schocker to me. I do think it's amazing that Schlosser did so much research for this book and I think he did a really good job writing it too."
4,"Read, if you want to know what is really in your fast food","Fast Food Nation gives great details on what is going behind the counter, in the slaughterhouse, and how fast food became so big. If you are interested and have the stomach to read about what you are eating and what eating it too often can do to you, this is a great. Sometimes he can get a little too detailed on the background information on the current fast food chains and what type of business advances they made in the past. Other than that it's hard too put down and it keeps your attention. Great Read!"
5,If you give more than two flips about what you eat,"This book will give you an insight into the dark and disgusting underbelly of modern meat processing. After reading this book, nobody in their right mind will ever eat fast food again. Fast Food Nation confirms all of your suspicions about fast food and the meat packing industry with well laid out and thoroughly documented facts. But, the best thing about this book.....as you near the end, you wonder, ""When....How can I ever eat meat again? There's got to be some clean, safe, meat somewhere!!"" Eric Schlosser points you in the right direction to find it."
5,Do you eat? READ THIS BOOK!,"If you eat food, this book will probably change how you do so. Whether it's due to moral indignation at the brutal way employees at meatpacking plants are treated, disgust at how your food is processed, or concern for the next generation of obese & brainwashed youth, you will find a reason to alter your buying habits.Eric Schlosser does a commendable job of keeping the reporting balanced & his (justifiable) anger in check. He simply reports facts, interviews both employees & owner/management types & in the last chapter, offers easily adopted solutions to the myriad of abuses & problems discussed.My title pretty much says it all. There is no negative to this book to discuss, unless you have a financial stake in maintaining the status quo. In which case you should still read it, if only to understand the profound implications of your greed!"
2,Could use some Secret Sauce,"Fast Food Nation is a very powerful read, but Schlosser's writing is very dry (could use some gravy or secret sauce). Lots of facts and figures, not enough anecdotes, or first hand interviews. Schlosser mentions lots of different food agencies, goverment agencies, unions representing workers and restaurants, and farmers, and then just gives the acronyms. Pretty soon you can't remember if the IPAs or the GMC or the ICP are on the same side or opposite sides, etc. I'm glad to say that I was not put off eating French Fries, but I probably will hold off the s**t burger in future."
3,"Insightful, but tedious","I heard so many good things about this book, so i decided to try it out. At first, I was really into the book because it gave a lot of little known and interesting facts. but eventually, that's all it was: a tedious listing of facts. The detail was what made the book thorough and informative, but after awhile the detail started to drag down the content and made every little fact and statement over-analyzed. Yes, it offers a new perspective and outlook on the old well known fact that fast food is bad for you; yet, it was much too long and definitely could have been condensed and still have the same effect."
4,Ewww Fast Food,"Eric Schlosser's book Fast Food Nation is a book that everyone should read weather they eat fast food or not. Much of the talks about franchising, how hamburger meat and potatoes are producted, how fast food industries are anti-union and the science of food which I think everyone can learn from. The section about the science of food was especially interesting to me. Schlosser is a modern day muckraker much like the ones who found dirt on monopilized industries in the past and gives good evidence to back what what hes saying with his notes. Reading about the meat packing idustries was discusting but was the one of the most enjoyable parts of the book to me and I now think twice about going to fast food places. I gave this book four stars instead of five because the beging was too slow for me. I wanted to get into the discusting facts about fast food but feel like I had to wait a little too long time before Schlosser talked about it."
4,America and Its Naivete,"In Schlosser's message, I did not encounter one bit of subjectivity, which was surprising. The facts were presented in terms that I could understand and then shown as examples that undoubtedly appealed to my emotions and reasoning. I was revolted by some of the appalling facts (with good reason!), but I was never provoked into anger. The anger and horrification I felt were more, as I later realized towards the end of the book, the brilliance of Schlossser's writing ability. He has simply laid out the facts for every American to read and ""digest"" and has guided us towards our emotions, allowing us to acknowledge our dilusions. As the saying goes, ""One can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink,"" however, Schlosser led us to the water and left us no other choice but to drink or feign ignorance with petty guilt."
5,Great book,This is a very thought-provoking book on the topic of the fast food industry in the U.S. I'd highly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject.
2,For mr. jimenez,"I liked this book. It didn't really do anything for me other than elaborate, to great length, a fact which i was already privy to.All in all I have to say that it felt like a school assignment reading this. Which is exactly what it was."
4,Modern Day Jungle,"This is a pretty disturbing book about fast food. I was reading it on an airplane on the way to San Francisco when the stewardess brought be some sort of 'steak' sandwich. I couldn't eat it after reading the stories of the meat packing companies such as IBP. This book primarily deals with McDonalds, but includes others as well. Covers a lot of the facets of the fast food industry including history, advertising, sprawl, employee treatment, crime related to, where the food comes from, chemical treatment to make it taste 'good', and others. Definitely worth a read."
4,Response To Reviewer From Portland,"Arby's is mentioned in this book, on page 222.Overall, this is an outstanding book. Some of the stories will actually make you cringe, particularly about they way workers in the slaughterhouse are treated. Almost as bad as the way publicist Michael Levine of Los Angeles treats his interns. Let's hope he doesn't read this book or he'll get some good ideas on how he can cheat people even further."
5,A must read,"This book is well researched and well written. It definitely gives one something to think about when it comes to how we eat, where our food comes from and what our nutritional future holds. Even if you don't have any intention of changing your current dietary habits - know what your eating. It's hard hitting but not pessimistic."
4,Eye Opening,"This book has changed my life for the better. Before I used to eat fast food whenever because it was convenient, but after reading this book. I am now aware of the dangers of fast food. Eric Schlosser masterfully covers each aspect of America's fast food industry. Ever single fact that Eric wrote about kept me hooked and wanting to read more. I recommend this book to anyone that has ever eaten fast food before."
4,think twice before going to McDonald's,"Eric schlosser gives graphic details about the fast food indestry. I'll think twice before going to McDonald's and ordering something to eat.It's a really good book, I recommend this book to everyone. I espeacially recommend this book to people who eat fast food on a daily basis so that they think twice about eating there."
4,Fast Food Nation,"This book tells you everything about fast food. It tells you from how it all got started to all the companies that go along side of it. It tells you about their greediness, how they miss treat their employees, and whats really in the food they serve you. The book is well written and is very informative."
3,fastfoodnation,"Bought the book for my sister and her husband, they enjoy it. I have not read it yet."
1,Thought provoking and frightening,"This book is both distrubing and disconcerting. For anyone who is a hardened carnivore, read this book and then order that Big Mac."
4,Tastes Great,"Fast Food Nation does a very good job of showing the greasy underbelly of an industry that has long been at odds with the American public. It is easy to takes sides with Schlosser and see the fast food industry as an unstoppable and gluttonous economic forced that is responsible for everything from the destruction of the family to farm to environmental savages. So, it seems like a liberal read as you begin, but Schlosser is surprising fair. He is repulsed and enamored by the process as we are. It's an honest look at a disturbing industry."
1,Worked at Mcdonalds,"I had to read this book for ENG 101, and I found it a little misleading. Not defending Mcdonalds in any way, this book is inaccurate in some of its accounts. I have been previously employed by the big M and the accounts in which Schlosser tells of are isolated incidents. What goes on other than that I am not wholly sure of. However, young girls don't work all day till their exhausted, as well as the other ""select"" stories Schlosser has in his book. I know that much of the book is true, but that does not make up for the 1% occurance of the information he portrays as normality."
3,Depends on your opinion..?,"The book itself arrived in perfect condition and was clean. Even the corners were brand new. The material within...well that's a matter of opinion. There are a lot of facts but I don't appreciate that he trash talks America a lot when he lives here. That bugged me a little, but to each it's own."
5,Illuminating,"Schlosser creates a vibrant and extremely informative expose' of America through the demon that has become the fast food industry. According to Schlosser, American culture has become defined by the entire concept of fast food. Through stripmalling, anti-labor practices, mass production,and swelling waistlines, America's landscape looks sadly bland, uniform and souless.This is not to suggest that hope has vanished. Schlosser points out businesses that have retained solid and sanitary practices (In and Out Burger)and points to positive results of consumer outrage. Fast Food Nation is a call to action for all Americans to seriously evaluate the origins of our food and our culture. Schlosser's excellent and detailed reporting, along with his expert ability to turn a phrase, illuminates the entire process that produces our nation's (and ultimately the world's) food. He goes great lengths to show how we are all interconnected through food, labor, transit and technology.A must read."
5,Preaching to the Choir,The book I always would have wanted to write. But someone much more capable beat me to it. Fantastic. Thanks Eric.
4,fast food nation review,"everything you could had have ever wanted to know about fast food is in this book, in most cases it is everything you have ever wanted to not know about fast food. Overall it is a really good book written really well, so read it!"
1,Not Text Enabled,"This sounds like an interesting read, but I won't buy any Kindle title which is not text-enabled. The publisher apparently wishes to insist that the purchaser buy both the Kindle version AND an audio version of the book, so I will buy neither."
3,fast food nation,"great book, not boring like most books. i really think its one of the books that i ever read. it is very intresting. 2 thumbs up"
2,Could have been better,"This book would have been much better if Mr. Schlosser was not slanted one way; the left only. He failed to mention the legislation that the Democrats have passed to ruin FDA inspections. He should have reported both parties inequities or left them out. The book could have gone deeper into the improprieties of the fast food industry, instead of just scratching the surface. The book was a good read with out the political slant; It could have been excellent with leaving it out or including it all."
5,Excellent Expose on the Fast Food Machine,"I didn't know whether to be disgusted or angry after reading this, so I choose both. Disgusted by the recklessness and disregard of humanity these companies show in search of more profit. Angered by a government that would actually permit such horrendous practices to occur. And to any of those right-winged fools that try to attack the content of this book, take a look at the extensive notes Schlosser has filled with the entire back quarter of the book. Truth hurts, but better than not hearing it at all."
5,Who's afraid?,"Every year, 280,000 Americans die as a direct result of being overweight. This figure includes children aged six to ten who die from heart attacks caused by obesity. Probably the main reason for all this unhealthy fat is fast food.Do you love the people of the United States? Do you believe in a democracy in which every citizen is equally entitled to health and dignity?More specifically, do you want to know how to make informed choices concerning your own health?If so, read Fast Food Nation. Read carefully, read critically, and read courageously.Good health to all."
3,Just OK,"Well, the author did his homework. He ran around the country and did the interviews, so the book is very thorough. The problem is, it's just not very interesting. I thought it might be connected a little more to US cultural and social issues, but instead it's sort of an expose of the fast food industry. Not bad, I guess. Just OK>"
1,Not very good...,The book was not very interesting and I got board really fast...I would not recommend this book to children.
3,Fast poop nation,"If any one in the room has ever ate at a fast food restaurant rase your hand. Now if your the only one with there hand raised then your either in a room with a bunch of liars, or your alone. Either way you might want to take a gander into this book to see what you;ve been eating your whole life and how it is affecting the world we live in one happy meal at a time."
5,Everyone Should Read This Book,"This book is something that everyone should read, especially if you eat fast food or know people who do. Schlosser enlightens readers with astounding facts, stats and gruesome stories. His writing is very easy to read and although it's long, it goes by fast. Schlosser builds a strong case for why people shouldn't eat fast food and especially why people shouldn't give them their money. Find out for yourself and read it today."
3,Title Misleads,"I loved the concept of this book because we get sucked into eating [bad] food just for the sake of convience. I was eating at a lot of fast food resturants at the time and the food made me feel fat and drained. I picked up the book for motivation to stop eating it.The book's title is misleading in that the second part of the book focuses not on the fast food industy, but the meat processing industry. (If you need further justification of being a vegetarian, this is it) My brother in law stopped eating meat ""cold-turkey"" (pardon the pun) after reading this, and I have boycotted Mikey D's since because of their business practices (based soley on greed) and their refusal to improve the quality of their food. For me the food is just [bad] and I am not going to give them my hard-earned money for ....I highly recommend the book for its eye-opening information on the food industry."
5,A MUST READ,If you have ever consumed food at any fast food chain in the world you must read this book. Disturbing. You will stop feeding the exec's at all the large chains. You just might stop eating beef!! Eric does a great job from the history to where the meat in your burger comes from. I HIGHLY suggest everyone read this book. It should be required reading in all US High Schools.
5,"""The Jungle"" for the 21st century","This book provides an excellent view into the inner workings of the fast food, but mostly the meat-packing industry. This book is necessary for all Americans to read, become aware of what IS going on with big business and what our government is doing about it. If you are passionate about human rights, environmentalism or just democracy, you should read this book."
5,This is a MUST READ for everyone,This is one of the most informative books I have ever read. The information in this book is something that every American should know before putting anything in their mouth! I am absolutely amazed at how in the dark I was about the nations food industry before reading this book. Eric Schlosser should be praised for bringing this information to the nations attention. THANK YOU MR. SCHLOSSER!!
5,A Must-Read for All Hungry Consumers,"If you've ever wondered what a fast food hamburger is made of, do yourself a favor and read this book!"
2,Fast Food Nation DISHES OUT THE DIRT!,Eric Schlosser really dishes out the dirt with this book describing the not so pleasant side of fast-food. This book was a real eye-opener and will make me think twice the next time I grab a bite to eat.I recommend this book to everyone.
5,Fast food is slow death,"Schlosser's expose of the fast food industry is an eye opener. But he shows only the tip of the iceberg. Weston Price, Denis Burkitt, and others, showed years ago that when people ate their traditional food, they were free of the degenerative ailments that are rampant in our society, such as cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, etc., etc. These pioneers also showed that, when people abandoned their traditional diets and ate our junk food, they came down with the same ailments that we suffer from. Sally Fallon, and Mary Enig explain this fully in their book, ""Nourishing Traditions."" That being said, Schlosser's book is a welcome addition to the growing number of books helping people see the truth about junk food. Everybody should read it. Thousands of lives could be saved if they did. Fast food is slow death."
5,The Lies Exposed,"Shocking, stomach turning; and if you had problems giving up fast food before reading this book, this will get solve your addiction. I wish I had known about this book when my children were smaller. My daughter is finally fast food free except for an occasional foray with Wendy's; having found that after eating at any fast food place, especially McDonald's, that her stomach would give her problems for days.This book should be required reading in all nutrition courses. For an even more comprehensive view of America's food and medicine takeover by huge manufacturing concerns, Randdall Fitzgerald's The Hundred Year Lie is a great, well rounded expose starting with the early 1900's, and how the plans were laid to put profit above health for Americans."
4,a good read plus educational information,"I started to read Fast food nation for my economics class..i thought that i wouldn't like it that much, but it completely changed my views about eating at fast food restaurants, and i ended up loving it! Before reading this book, i thought that going to a fast food restaurant was simple, and just a place to grab a meal, after reading fast food nation, i realized the background information on fast food joints, and the minipulation that goes along with selling/buying a cheeseburger. Reading this book will make you think before you go and purchase a small bag of french fries."
3,"Interesting, though politically-skewed, analysis of fast-food mega corporations","Purchased for child's high school Senior English class. I read it as well, and we discussed the contents and postulations of the author.PRO: Eric Schlossler encourages his audience to think for themselves (i.e. avoid brainlessly following mass-market advertising) before consuming fast-food meals. He is effective at following the development of the meals produced by one fast-food chain from the farm/ranch, through the laboratories, to the manufacturers/packing plants and onto the consumer's waistline.CON: Although he mentions several members of the fast-food industry as he opens his essay, he focuses on one particular fast-food restaurant chain. As such he comes across as someone with an ax to grind. Further, 5 of the 6 pages in his epilogue contain politcal diatribe, and describe his feelings of persecution for his view points."
5,Ewwwww!,That is what you will say when finish reading this book. It seems that the only thing I can trust to eat is my fingernails. This book relates stories up through the early 2000's but is no less relevant today. Perhaps it is more important to read this book now to understand the damage we are doing to ourselves by not demand more humanely treated and cleaner food
5,Fast food,It was well written and not as gross as suspected. Although it was like nonstop information it was still really good.
5,Must read,"What a great wake up call for all those so blind to real food. Was surprised to see my hometown of Keokuk, IA mentioned. Great book!"
4,Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal,"One day I was trying to buy some books in the book store, then I saw Fast Food Nation this book. First, I was extremely interesting in the title of the book, because I do not really like any fast food in any fast food restaurant. Second, the style of the cover catches my attention. Then afetr I read the book, I realize that it talks about the dark side of the fast food that makes me feel even more unique and interested. Then as I was reading the book, I was surprised by the statistic numbers that contains in that book; Americans spent $110 billion on fast food in 2001. Also I am impress of how those smart people commence to make some great ideas of producing food in the fast speed for the busy people. And I feel how smart they are by using commercials to make more and more children and adults to buy fast food. And I think this book is great."
4,"Fast, Fun, Rewarding","Having not eaten a McDonalds hamburger in over a year, Eric Schlosser's book Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal won't change my buying habits, but it certainly made me more aware of the sinister side of the fast food industry. Schlosser's opinion about fast food is obvious from the get-go, but he does not paint a completely partisan picture with his words. Rather, he grasps the historical significance in the development of fast food and takes his readers on a journey through fast foods beginnings in Southern California to marketing strategies, food preparation, hiring practices, and its global impact."
4,"Chris ""Chris"" Santa monica ca","i though the book was very insightful i have read other books and watched movies that gave the same type of information, but Eric did a great job at making the book an enjoyable read for everyone."
4,Great read,"This is a great read, not only for the many interesting and shocking facts and anecdotes presented. The author attempts to trace historical trends from the end of World War II using the fast food industry as an anchor. Obviously, a book of this nature is not going to get a handle on all the complexities of our society, but it's a good venture all the same. The author throws a lot of different information into the mix which may bore some, but fascinated me.It seems to me that many of the negative reviewers for this book are probably either conservatives who are allergic to the faintest hint of a liberal attitude, or fast food industry people appalled at having their dirty laundry aired. If you fall under either of these categories, don't read this book."
4,"I'll always love meat, but not burger king","I work at a fatburger and its pretty clean, after reading fast food nation, uts really clean.I had no idea how dirty and wrong the fast food industry was. Its filty.Fast food nation convinced me to stop eating fast food, not meat entirely, but fast food for sure.I always wondered why the meat tasted funny, now I know why, its not beef. Its NU meat. So nasty."
4,good but long,i thought this book was very horrifying yet informative. It definitely makes me think twice about going to a fast food place. i would recommend this book to anyone because it's a very fast read ~~but it is quite long!
4,You won't eat fast food,"i enjoyed this book very much. It really tells the truth behind fast food. Not only the fod but how the companies work, and how it all started. the book was pretty interesting and kept me reading which is a miracle since I hate to read. However, some parts of the book got a little boring. But as a whole, it was a good book."
5,An Eye Opener Full of Statistics,"This book has had such an amazing effect not only on me but on my family as well. Every time I came across something that was worthy of yelling out I did. I have eaten at fast food restaurants across the nation since i was a little toddler. It never came to my attention of the ""god-awful"" things that these business put into making the food that I love. The biblical quote, ""the truth shall set you free"" is the exact feeling that came to my as I finished the book. I have never read such a book that delved into so my different background stories. The fact that the author spent so my time alone researching for the book proves that he felt strongly about what he was trying to prove. The most important aspect in this book are the effects that the fast food tycoons have over the nations. And how many of the technology advances and businnes studies have their foundation in the fast food business. I would recommend this book to any one who is willing to change!"
2,"Interesting Facts, Rambling Text","There are some interesting facts throughout the book. The history of the fast food industry is rather interesting. However, some of the chapters read like a rambling, disconnected biased news article."
5,Great service,"I ordered my book on wednesday and it arrived friday, its also in a better condition then i thought. Thanks!!"
4,Good Book,"This book is great. If you ever want to quit a fast-food habit, this will help you! I enjoyed it a lot."
5,This book will change the way you look at fast food,"If you like fast food, read this book. If you don't like fast food, read this book. It will change the way you look at ""America's Food""."
3,Fast Food Nation = War on Drugs,"While this book is very interesting, I agree with others that it is not particularly balanced. I could easily spin fast food restaurants as ""being brave enough to provide job opportunities for the poor.."". But my real issue is reflected in another review here: that we've all been helpless victims. We have not yet abdicated our personal responsibilities as citizens and adults. I would equate the metaphor in this book with the war on drugs. It is the demand, not the supply, that causes the epidemic. To get to the root of it, read this book, but then reflect on the root causes of consumerism and personal responsibility. And above all, remember that we really vote our wallet, not our ballots."
4,"The TRUTH hurts, doesn't it?","I though the beginning was a little slow but as you continue reading, you realize it's setting up for the big story. I was very disturbed, shocked and angered as I learned about the history of McDonalds, the meatpacking plants, the lack of USDA enforcement, the nonchalant attitudes of the government and organizations like OSHA. I didn't eat much fast food before but now I never will again. How many more reasons do you need to NOT eat it?Unlike the reviewers who just commented on political agenda or dismissed the book entirely as fiction, I actually read the book, ignored the so-called-politcal agenda, and passed it on to friends.The truth hurts and obviously some people can't handle it."
3,FAST FOOD RESPONSES,"This was a great book, especially liked the deep to help understand the process, the full of details about all aspects of the fastfood.However Mr schlasser just have spent more time to speak about the specifically ecologicals problems, and not only about the USA but in on mondial echelle.Finally, he seems a little too much pessimistic.We doesn't forget that the majority of people used the fastfood occasionally; so it's not so bad and very practical. In the life, all things is an question of equilibre : not to much but not never, especially when you leave in a city and when you have children.You have to feel yourself the limits and your possibility to respect those, in spite of the pressure of the systeme, the lying publicity.The idealistic solution should be more to come back at a ""slowly life"", take the time to cook and speak, and, at first, to be happy with less superficial things."
4,More Food Please!!!,"Well this is a great book that really got me thinking about what I really eat. I don't think I'll ever look at a burger the same way again without thinking about how it was processed. As a fast food consumer I took this book really serious especially since I know so many people who are overweight because of fast food. Back in the old cave man days obesity was never a real issue since everyone worked hard to eat what little they hunted. Know a days people can order pizza on the phone, walk a few steps and boom there you have a nice greasy pizza. This book showed me how the consumption of fast food has become a fast growing economy building business overnight. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone it teaches the reader about the politics behind the fast food industry and the actual processing of the food. I can guarantee you that you will not want to stop reading this book."
4,Fast Food Nation,"Fast Food Nation lifts the curtain from in front of the hidden scenes of American business and culture and their effects on our lives. This book is both intriguing and educational. Schlosser's ability to balance humor, tragedy and truth is admirable and entertaining. Fast Food Nation is a real eye opener, forcing its audience to see fast food for what it really is, poison to the global economy, diet, and culture."
4,"A good book, but not exactly what I thought","I thought that this book was good, but it was totally different from what I expected. I thought that it would literally be about fast food; burgers, fries, etc. it was but it also talked about everything that encompasses those burgers and what goes into them (how the animals are killed and all of that good stuff.) I never really ate at fast food places to begin with, and after reading this book it gave me even more reason to continue to not eat there. It's unhealthy!"
3,Interesting and informative,"Also for my Sociology class, but this was a lot more interesting and easier to follow. I like this book, I might just read it again just for fun."
4,Eye opening comprehensive verbal documentary.,"Deep dive into politics and supply chain issues of making food. Surprising and shocking how the initial good ideas of making food fast became good business, then degenerated because of greed and short cuts to processes that harm the workers making or processing the food, as well as consumers/purchasers. If you are a parent, grandparent, concerned/charitable citizen you should read this book. It's an engrossing story, reminding me of Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle""."
2,Paging off,"I hate, hate, hate this E-book. The page numbers are numbered off, which makes it hard to quote this source. It is more annoying to find something in this book, and highlighting. I ended up switching to paper back."
4,Ugh. Will make you mad and queasy.,"I never held any fast food company up to very high standards, but I was still shocked by what I read in this book. Schlosser shows that fast food problems extend far beyond the quality and cleanliness of the food the customer eats. The taint goes to meatpacking firms, the conglomeration of agriculture worldwide, a permanent lower class of low-skill, low-paid workers, the ghetto-ization and homogenization of world culture...or at least this is the case that Schlosser tries to make. He is more convincing in some parts than others. But the overall picture he provides is the same...fast food is ultimately a dangerous and immoral trend, and the solution lies with customers making smarter, more informed decisions."
3,My Book Review,This was a really good book. It really went into a lot of detail when talking about the fast food industry. It was very descriptive and really made me think twice when I think about going to Mc Donalds. I really recommend this book to anyone whos loves to eat at any fast food place.
4,Scholsser: an astute man,"There's a good reason why Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation is subtitled ""The Dark Side of the All-American Meal."" Although the book is filled with fascinating history and facts we don't normally think about -- including the best information we're ever likely to get on why french fries taste so good -- it's ongoing in its pursuit of connections. Schlosser won't rest until we're fully informed about how our Big Mac came to lie before us on its plastic tray."
3,Fast Food Nation,"I found this book very insightful, it really made me reconsider not only fast food resaurants but many factors of our society. It draws attention to how companies are exploiting the general public. Although i did enjoy the final message, while reading it, it did become rather tedious. everything was described in such detail that i felt the urge to skip paragraphs. I understand that all these ancedotes belonged in this book, and they every item mention correlated to message of the book, but it did become boring. I truly recommended that people should read this book but that it is ok to skip lines and ocassionally paragraphs."
2,Too Much to Digest,"I thought this book would be an interesting read. Some parts are, but the rest of the book just goes on and on and on. Schlosser needed to do more editing on this book.The book had anti-business tones sprinkled throughout and the author believes that the Fast Food Industry is responsible for peoples health problems and obeseity. Whatever happened to personal responsibility? Whoever doesn't know that fast food is not very good for you is quite ignorant."
5,fast food vs. home food,By reading this book it really changed the way I see the fast food restaurents because now I think about what I am really eating instead of just eating it. Also I think that the fries that I though were so good aren't as good as I though because I know now that what I am really eating is pure grease and hamburgers that may have a bacteria. Maybe I'll just stay with my homefood and I will know what I put in all my food so I won't have to worry that I could get sick with any other food. I know that I will be safe with my cooking than other people cooking my food.
3,Fast Food Nation by eric schlosser ....good book,"Fast food Nation by eric schlosser I thought was a good book especially for being the first book he wrote.I thought it was great how the book started a movement and actually forced changes in the fast food industry. This book showed me the power that words can accomplish. I also found the research and detail that schlosser put into this book fascinating. altough i did not find a clear plot in the book, i rate this book giving it 3 out of 5 stars. I also recommened this book to everyone who wants to know the truth about the fast food industry and how discusting it is."
4,"Great book, although not entirely fast-food related","This a very solid book related to a frequently referenced market. Extraordinarily thorough, the research lends insight to the practices that contribute to the final product that are rarely discussed (e.g., production, workforce, consumers). Well written with moving graphic images of some of the ""consequences"" of the Fast Food movement. At times, it does seem as thought there is an underlying axe to grind, and the purist business fan might get disinterested in the detail provided on the meat industry. After the first third of the book, the focus shifts behind the scenes, and the actual organizations move into the background, to the dismay of anyone interested in the fast food industry. All told, it does build on prior research, and is a pleasant read."
4,Cheesburger anyone?,"This book put so many things into perspective for me, and made me question more things fast food related, like how many illegal immigrants, or just immigrants, were hurt while making my big mac. Also, how many ranchers are not making enough money to support their families because meat companies are controlling the prices. These are the kind of questions presented and answered in this book. Fast Food Nation, The Jungle of our times, shows how food safety and food health issues are still current issues in this powerful cosmopolitan world of ours. I recommend this to any fast food consumer, not to make them quit eating fast food, unless you want to, but to become more aware of what goes on in the world, especially on the home front, wherever that may be."
4,Fast Food Nation,"I enjoyed reading the book very much, although I thought that the book could have examined some of the issues more thoroughly. The first half of the book examines the cultural history of fast food from the creation of burger restuarants to labor practices. The second half discusses food practices such as the meat packing industry.I think though that a part that was missing from the book that is very important to a ""fast food nation"" is an examination of why Americans enjoy the food so much. I didn't feel the book touched on this topic as much.Overall the book was easy reading and I learned a lot of information that I found very interesting."
4,interesting oversight,"This book presented an excellent history on the fast good establishments in the United States, and at this point around the world. Although not quite as many gruesome details as I thought reading other reviews I will admit that it was quite an eye opener on many aspects of what has happened, more in the past that the present. The issue of government ""protetection"" of the industry was quite interesting. As was the effect on foreign countries health in the aftermath of the introduction of fast food. A worthwhile read with lots of information that needs to be read by anyone exposed to our fast food eating, mobile lifestyle."
5,Awesome!!!,"This book was absolutely wonderful, it finally explained the whole workings behind the evils of McDonalds. It made me become a vegetarian, and made me look closer a what ""stuff"" is in our food. MUST READ if you want to start to have a healthy diet and prevent disease!! READ IT!!"
4,A thoroughly enjoyable read! But could be a little less end of the world in its tone.,This book is an expose into the seedy underworld of the American food system. It takes the reader throughout the massive infrastructure that is present in the United States and how the political clout that it wields is unnecessarily putting our health at risk. The message is an important one to cast and we as Americans should be absolutely apalled that things have gotten this bad. That being said I felt that his tone was to dreary and at times he focused to much attention on minute details that took away from his key message. I definately recommend that you pick it up. Don't be surprised if you have to walk away at times because of being overwhelmed by both the nature of the subject as well as his slow and meandering writing style.
3,Just my thoughts....,"Wasn't what I thought it was going to be when I chose it, but I did enjoy learning the historical part anyway."
4,A real eye opener!!,I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this book and will say while I haven't finished it yet I am really enjoying this read. The information I am learning on the fast food industry and it's history has been amazing to say the least. I definately would recommend this to anyone even if you don't eat fast food. It's a great way to learn how this industry has played a major role in shaping our culture!
4,Careful What You Eat ...,"Schlosser's book is a landmark for journalistic non-fiction. This is a great read because it is well-structured, well-sourced, and on an interesting topic. There are elements of humor throughout despite the scarier sides of food production."
5,What Fast Food Nation will do for America,"As I came half way into the book, I began to think that Schlosser was just another American who would begin a national reform on our fast food corporation. His work resembles a lot of the work that Upton Sinclair and Jacob Rii's did in the early 1900's with poverty and the slaughterhouses. Their work helped change the way American's live and has remained apart of our culture since then. I believe that Schlosser's work will slowly begin to change the way people eat and will slowly reform our fast food habits in America. Atleast I hope so."
4,Very thought provoking book,"Fast Food Nation shows the evolution of fast food, and shows just how the modern day fast food chains work. It goes right into the heads of the people that run these multinational corporations, and shows subtle examples of the damage it has done to us culturally, enviromentally, physically, and socially. Fast Food Nation is a good book that not only shows the damage that bad food does, but the damage of capitalistic corporations in a world that is run by money."
3,Not bad,"I chose this book thinking I was going to know gorry details about the book, but only found about the beginning of these huge corporations who have managed to make millions of dollars from the nation. Of course it talks about the slaughter of beef and poultry, but if you eat meat you already knew that, right?! Its nothing new and no matter what people are not going to stop eating fast food because either way its freaking good!"
5,The Big Picture,"If you thought that the problem with artery-clogging fast-food burgers was that they were setting you on-course to an early death, well, you missed the bigger picture. The real damage is much worse. And widespread. Schlosser performs a thorough investigation of the complete wreckage. Essential reading (before it is too late)."
1,Dissapointing-too much one sided rhetoric,"It's all about selling books folks-in this case,Schlosser compiled as much ""dirty laundry"" as he could,"" in order to line his own pockets. Truth be told there have been, continues to be, and will be be in the future, problems within the fast food and the meat industries. As there are in ALL industries. I believe though, both produce and market the safest products in the world. Maybe Sclossers next book shoud be, Fast Food Nation, The BRIGHT Side Of The All American Meal."
1,nothing new here,"fast food unhealthy?slaughter houses - bad places to work?macdonalds job = low pay?if these sort of things surprise you then buy this book. if not, skip it.don't expect alot of in depth information in this book, a very simple shallow investigation in the tradition of television journalism."
2,What a disappointment!,"This book is a real yawner. At multiple points through the book I stopped and wondered, ""Where's the story?"" There was nothing there, unless you think it is big news that the REAL reason McDonald's puts playgrounds at their stores is to <gasp> sell more food! Or if you think it is wrong for fast food restaurants to hire young, unskilled workers because they can pay them less. Or that the ability for restaurants to provide tasty, inexpensive food is somehow moving America in the wrong direction.While the history of fast food presented in the book was fairly interesting, the commentary was bland and unconvincing. The author yearns for the time when workers hadn't a care in the world, and everybody lived well; in other words, this book is nothing more than nostalgia for the imaginary. I recommend you skip it."
2,Lots of Beef- No Sizzle,This diatribe has more holes in it than a swiss cheese factory.Schlosser has people at restaurants in the 1950's putting their food in micro-wave ovens- after that little else can be believed other than his conspicous distaste for corporate America and capitalism.A must read for Ivy League vegans.
1,Shock Schlock,"Everyone knows that they don't really want to know what goes into what they eat or see how its prepared (unless you are glatt kosher). So many pages devoted to exposing the worst of the fast food and meatpacking industries is passe.Vegeterianism and socialism are not the answers. Rodents have been known to overwhelm silos and storage facilities. The government allows all sorts of nasty stuff into the products we consume. For instance, the government allows a certain amount of rodent droppings into dairy products and cyanide into the water supply. I like that fast food employees have work and are not ripping off my car stereo system or committing other crimes. It is not disturbing that people can choose to eat dangerous levels of fat, cholesterol, and calories in a free and affluent country."
1,"Sorry, I like McDonalds","Politics aside, this book is pure torture to read. Suffering from insomnia, I chose to lay away rather than read four pages of this boring book. Its pure negative energy, telling us how fast food is heralding the end of the United States. It's never fair or balanced.And here's the main problem; McDonalds is good - I'm not ashamed to say it. So I feel sorry for Mr. Schlosser because now he can't go into McDonalds without feeling like a hypocrite, and I bet he's dying for cheeseburger.Perhaps working conditions could be better, and animals could be treated more humanely. But for every teenager making 1,000 hamburgers for lunch for $6.25 and hour, there are 1,000 people who bought a good burger for $1.00. That's a good thing, isn't it?Sure, fast food is bad for you in large quantities. Brie Cheese is bad for you. Booze is bad for you. Sex is bad for you.But I'm going to have another Big Mac before I die, but I won't be reading this book again."
2,title misleading,I bought his book expecting more stories on how the restaurants are actually run. What I got is more of an expose on how the meat industry is run.I read the excerpts of the book and they do not tell the whole story.
2,Call me confused...,"I don't see why the author of this book should have such a chip on their shoulder about fast food. I'm guessing here of course, since I haven't actually read the book, but if the author had their way we'd all be waiting in line for food to be served at a relaxed, unhurried pace. In this day and and age, this is simply not going to cut it, since many people depend on being able to get their food as soon as they order it, sometimes even directly through the window of their automobile. I'm not sure if the author is aware of this. Call me confused, but if you take that away from people, they'll probably revert back to bringing packed sandwiches from home, perhaps with a flask of their favourite beverage, since they won't have the time to buy their food from the long-winded commercial outlets. Don't blame the food - it's just trying to keep up with the general pace of life nowadays..."
1,Garbage,This author truly has an agenda. If people abide by his philosophy we would return to an agrarian society.
3,Fast Food and the Truth,"This book is very eye opening. However, as an Animal Science major I have read and evaulated this book from a different perspective. First of all everyone complains about the lack of enforcement in the slaughter plants and the lack of overall enforcement in the food chain. In order to fix this problem, consumers need to be willing to pay more for meat they buy. We all try to save money, but we cannot save money and at the same time complain about consequences of it. Everyone knows it is hard to have your cake and eat it too! In addition like every book your read you need to take it all with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, this is a great book to open the eyes of America, but before you get upset about some practices in the food industry, do some research for yourself beyond this book."
3,gay harlequin,"I did not have many expectations when I ordered this book, I did it just out of curiosity.I was both disappointed and relieved: this short novel is clearly no Shakespeare, the plot is very thin and a little contrived, characterization is surely overdone. At the same time the writing is professional enough, the story is not bad and the characters are likeable.This is a perfect choice for anyone who wishes a couple of hours of very easy but not dull fun.A word of caution: this is supposed to be a gay romance and yet I was not a little disturbed by the rather explicit (and contrived) sex scenes. I am no prude, quite the contrary, but even if tasteful, the sweaty acts were really out of place, unnecessary for the plot.P.S. please, someone mend the cover ""art""."
1,Soap-Opera-ish,"I wanted so very much to like this book ;gay men need some really wonderful gay romance novels. Sadly the writing here is so sophomoric that I couldn't even manage to get through it. Trite and over-worked characters caught up in a silly,soap-opera-ish and gushingly romanticized plot coupled with cliche driven writing and limpid prose with illogical character development was enough for me to stop reading after page 25.If you like this genre,Gordon Merrick (The Lord Won't Mind) writes far better pot-boiler romantic melodrama than this and has the distinction of being the ground-breaker in this style way back in the 60s.Try his Peter and Charlie trilogy-infinitely superior to this silly novel."
4,good selections,This is a prescribed text for my 5th grader. The stories are varied and so is the difficulty level. Sport stories are interesting and there is a lot of non-fiction reading. Some concepts seem advanced and a little difficult to follow but it is good for introducing new vocabulary and explaining basic concepts of advanced topics. Overall good choice of stories and authors.
4,review,Was a nice continuation of the series. I would recommend watching them all one after the other. Nice fare interesting theme
3,A viewer,WARLOCK II is a pretty good fantasy thriller. I would have given this movie 4 stars but they tried to have some comedy scenes> the story line was good. WARLOCK II delievers 3 stars.
2,One of the many sequels failing to live up to the original,"Sands reprisal of his role as the Warlock is the only thing that gives this film 2 stars. Sadistic as ever, and with shorter hair, if you like seeing women getting all their hair ripped off then you should watch it."
4,Review,"A great score by Mark McKenzie who is not really well known as a composer but more of a orchestrator. The opening cue ""The Battle Has Just Begun"" is one of the many highlights of the score. With a orchestra and chorus together. The performace by the chorus is great but they are not too loud. They are chanting latin. When the Warlock appears that is when the chorus begins. Mostly with women choral. The other theme ""Ken's Magic"" is a good heroic piece of music. Although the sound is not up-to-date and the running time is around 40minutes it is a average buy. It will appeal to some."
3,very good sequel to a to an excellent film.,"I LOVED THE MOVIE WARLOCK.SO I BOUGHT WARLOCK THE ARMAGGEDON WITHOUT EVEN SEEING THE MOVIE.SO I WAS KINDA WONDERING IT WAS A BAD MOVIE AND IF I HAD WASTED MY MONEY.SO AFTER I HAD WATCHED IT I KNEW I HAD NOT WASTED MY MONEY.I THOUGHT IT HAD AN ORIGINAL STORY TO IT.AND I LIKED IT ALOUGHT AND I THOUGHT JULIAN SANDS WAS CREEPY AS THE WARLOCK.AND HE DID A VERY GOOD JOB AS THE WARLOCK.BUT WHAT I DID NOT LIKE WAS ALL OF THE GORE,BUT I RECOMMEND BUYING IT OR RENTING IT."
2,"Middle of the road. That's it, and that's all!","This movie is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the first one's success. Julian Sands once again returns as Satan's son, but he seems to be sleepwalking this go-round. Two disposable teenage actors (Paula Marshall and Christopher Young), play two descendants of Druid warriors who are the ONLY people who can fight the Warlock and prevent him from releasing Satan into Earth. Oh, and there are six rune stones or something he has to possess to unlock Satan from the bowels of the Earth (etc.etc.). You get the idea.Anyway, this has some pretty decent effects, and some pioneering computer animations, but all in all, it's a very weak film, and, putting the special effects aside, there's not much left but incompetent acting and cheap thrills. If you like the Warlock films or love Julian Sands, buy this one, or if you're curious, buy it, but overall, you could skip it without really missing anything."
2,Not what I thought I was buying,"Disappointing. A flimsy booklet that looks home made, very few pages. Would not have bought it if I'd know the contents. Was not useful for what we wanted it for which was to develop a Christmas advent calendar and functions."
2,good and bad,"This headset sounds fine and is reasonably comfortable. However, after a few weeks of use, the earphone sponge cover began disintegrating and became useless."
3,"A Post-Colonial work about race, oppression, and power...","I just finished reading this one for a class. It is a very complex novel that I think would benefit from multiple readings. The novel is extremely discriptive and tells the story of two women from different parts of the world and how their paths ultimately cross. Brand's prose is intricately woven with a combination of confusion, wonder, and anger that emminates through fresh use of voice and perception. The book illustrates the impact of the imperialism and the slave-trade in the Carribean and takes place in both the islands and Ontario. I recomend this one but caution that it is a book that takes effort to really get into it."
3,Does not fit PSP 1000,"I bought one of these for my psp 1000, but it was much too small. The company was great and sent me another one no questions asked, but again, was too small.Here is the product description as of 7-10-12""Compatible with Sony: PSP Only (PlayStation Portable) (NOT Compatible with PSP 2000 Slim)""It sounded to me like it was made for the original PSP. But since it's so thin, and doesn't fit the 2000 either, it must be for the 3000 only.I was given a refund and again, the seller (crazyondigital) handled it very well, but psp 1000 owners beware."
1,NOT for PSP 1000/FAT.,"The description of this item clearly state that it is for the PSP 1000 series (otherwise know as PSP Fat)and NOT the PSP 2000 (PSP Slim), but the case is completely wrong for the PSP 1000.Reasons:1. It doesn't fit.2. If it COULD fit, it doesn't have an opening for the memory stick bay.3. The speaker holes are in the wrong place.Overall, I feel that this case is made for the PSP 2000 and/or 3000 and that they should change the description to match.PS, This is a link to what I think should work for PSP 1000.http://www.amazon.com/Clear-Crystal-Hard-Cover-Case-PSP/dp/B003DS6LOU"
2,dont use it,i didn't like it and at such a small price just gave it to a cousin. It wasn't needed by me.
4,I Liked it!,"I like the case. Originally I wanted it for my psp 1000, but sadly it wasn't specific on which psp model this product was good for, but luckily my friend had the model this case was originally for and I gave it to him for a present."
4,"Works well, only minor fitment issues","Fits well, minor fitment issues like the d-pad and button cluster not being centered perfectly in the areas carved out for them, though this may well be due to minor differences in different PSP models. Speakers and microphone are both covered by the plastic shell, as is the headphone jack, so there is some minor audio muffling as a result, and you can't use headphones without removing the case."
1,Garbage,"This is junk! Very flimsy - but considering it's price, I guess I got what I paid for. Go for something a little higher quality."
3,for psp 1000's only,"The case provides protection primarily for the screen. I have a psp 3000 and because the case is designed for the thicker 1000, it was a very sloppy fit. This was remedied with some foam tape, but kind of a half baked fix. I would only buy this item if you had a 1000 psp."
3,It Works....,"It very nice, protection wise, i do enjoy the that if i were to drop it, hopefully this case will protect it."
3,Nice but not very durable,"I was very pleased with this product when we first recieved it. I got it for my son's christmas gift for his brand new PSP3000. It fit beautifully except for the flip part on the back where you put in and remove the games (UMD'S)...It is only the middle of January and the back flip part is now completely broken off and I just had to order a new (this time a jelly case) one. If it had been more durable and actually snapped right in the back then I would have been 100% happy with this product but because of one little glitch my review is negative... I would suggest if you are going to purchase this make sure it is for an adult or responsible, tactful teenager not for a child or carefree individual because you have to carefully open and close the backing everytime to keep from breaking the case.... By the way the case still fits the PSP just without the flap... But I don't want that to be scratched and ugly either...go figure"
3,Does not fit PSP Fat.,"I got the Crystal Case and was very happy with the condition I received it in.However, when I tried to put the case on my PSP Fat, it did not fit it was too SMALL.There are three models of PSP 1000 model Fat, 2000 Slim and 3000 GO.The package actually says and the claim is that they fit all PSP models, I,II,III and IIII."
4,psp crystal case,it is what it is keep in mind if u have a psp 1000 this isnt for u because it wont fit only 2000 and 3000 will fit but its really awesome i reccemend it if u have a psp 2000 or 3000 note for psp 1000 owners if u do not know what the diffrence is between the 1000 and 2000 and 3000 1000 is fatter than the rest 2000 has spekers on the bottom and the 3000 has spekers on top if this makes no since go to google images and look them up or go on youtube and look up coparisons so u will no the diffrece
2,psp clear case,"case was made for psp-slim (psp3000) can't beat the price at $0.99 the button layout for the home, volume, screen brightness, start/select works perfectly fine, but the case dosn't fit 100% the analog stick will get stuck between the case and the button are made rather difficult to press due to it being too close to the case. you can open and close the door for the UMD but it feels really flimsy and doesn't close half the time. I would suggest spending a few dollars more and buying a better case"
3,good but not good.,"it protect the PSP very good, but you cant use the volume bottom, also it open sometimes, the latch is nto holding very well."
1,wrong part shipped to me,the case i received was not the correct case. the case in the pics is for the original psp (thats what i needed)... the case i received looked nothing like the pics and didnt fit my sons psp...the case i received must be for the psp 2000/3000 not the original psp
3,PSP 1001 Case,"The case is alright. It is for the psp 1001. But the only problem i have is that I do not like how the case dosnt have a good way to press the buttons like select,volume,home,exe. But overall if it wasnt for that and also that to change memory sticks you have to take off the case it will be a great product. If you hace the psp 2000 or the psp 3000 this is not the case for you. IT WILL NOT FIT. I recommend one made by psyclone for psp slim. I have had it for a couple of years and my psp still looks brand new thanks to it. So overall I give this product 3.5 stars. Trust me on the psyclone case you will not regret it."
1,VER BAD PRODUCT...,"Eforcity is a great seller. A+. smooth transactions and very fast shipping, BUT this product is the worst, pictures are real nice here, but the final product is badly manufactured and very uncomforable for real players, it is great if you want to put your psp away and nothing will happen to it, but playing with it is awefull ! NOT RECOMMMENDED !!! the best cover or case for the psp while playing is the silicone ones !"
5,"On Par With Casablanca, Breakfast at Tiffanies?","Is ""The Muppet Movie"" on the same level of quality as ""Casablanca"" and ""Breakfast at Tiffanies""? What about ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Gone with the Wind""?I'd like to think that a seven year old might consider this among the greatest films ever. With no heavy message, ""The Muppet Movie"" is sheer joy. The singable songs, the colorful characters, the incredible silliness of it all make it a movie worth watching with your family without hesitation.As a DVD, you won't find many of the extras you might see on other films, but the kids won't care. In fact, as fun as the trailers are, your young ones simply want to watch the movie.I first saw this movie as a child, and still know the words to ""Rainbow Connection.""I fully recommend ""The Muppet Movie"".Anthony Trendl"
5,"""Life's like a movie-write your own ending""","Jim Henson was the true genius of our time. It's a shame to see the pablum kids have to suffer through nowadays-the brainless repetition of Barney, the perpetual Power Ranger battles, and cheesy ""teen life"" high school dramas. This was a fantastic movie debut-and the only movie Steve Martin and Richard Pryor were both in!"
5,Don't be crazy. Get this movie,"Hmmmm...BrianH...as in Brian Henson, maybe? Either way, if you haven't seen this movie, see it. If you don't own this movie, buy it. The music is splendid and the story is great. This beats all the cookie-cutter animated movies coming out of Hollywood these days by miles."
1,"NO BLU-RAY??? Love the movie, but we need an unedited Blu-Ray edition!!!",What's the hold up with The Muppet Movie Blu-Ray? I've been reading that some of the DVD versions are missing some scenes or lines from the original theatrical release. PLEASE release an unedited theatrical version on Blu-Ray! With lots of bonus material! Pronto! Thank you!
5,One of the greatest films of my childhood,"I don't care if I'm 22 or not,I just love this film.The Muppet Movie is the best of the Muppet films,it's funny,cute,charming and just plain fun to watch.Filled with cameos from some of Hollywood's best and with some of the best songs like my favourite which is The Rainbow Connection sung by Kermit and the begining of the film.The film as some very memorable lines but the most memorable are Kermit's at the end ""Life's like a movie,write your own ending.""The Muppet films aren't as good as they were in the past,so just watch the first three Muppet films and love them.Jim Henson will always be a genuis and will always be Kermit The Frog."
4,Please put it on DVD...,This movie is the ultimate classic. You get to see Kermit and Company make a trek to Hollywood the dream factory... this was the first film that shows Kermit riding a bike! In a way kermit achieved his dream of making it big in Hollywood. this is a true blue classic! this film was direct by Jim Frawley (The Monkees) He has a cameo in the bar scene. Passing out Frog Legs to a couple at a table... Watch for it.
5,Still a winner - on its way to Classic,"My husband & I took my nine year old sister to this movie on one of our first dates! Now our kids are watching it on video. This is one that will definately stand the test of time & I'm sure my grandchildren will be watching it. I still love the ""fork in the road"" & ""gone with the Schwinn""!"
2,The Muppet Movie - Ridiculous and A Waste of Time!,"I love the show and I love the 2011 movie, but this is ridiculous. The plot is lame, the script is lame and I think this film has one purpose - to put you to sleep! There was only one good part in this movie - the opening when Kermit sings ""The Rainbow Connection"". After that the movie is as dull as dull can be. This film will for sure bore your kids to death. What is the point in buying this? ... Exactly. There is no point. If I were you go and buy the 2011 film which is way better than this."
1,50th anniversary?,"Would somebody please explain the Kermit's 50th anniversary advertising to me? The Muppet Movie came out in 1979, and if they are saying 50th anniversary that would be 1955. I know because I am 50 and the Muppets did not come til much later. Maybe 50 years in a frog's life is 26 years to you and me."
2,Disappointed in quality -- not restored version,"I love this movie, and was so disappointed to see all the mars on the dvd image that you'd expect when watching an old VHS tape. I've never bought a DVD that had this problem before, and would not have purchased the product had I known the situation. In addition, the audio, is not the best quality--sounds almost non-stereo, maybe a bit hollow and shallow. I definitely do not recommend purchasing this item until the studio restores it."
4,Brings back fond memories,"Ah, something my children and I can watch together and not drive me insane.This is the original muppet movie from 1979. I remember seeing it in the theater as a child. My kids like the singing, but get bored with the dialouge. But they are young (18 mo. & 32 mo.), so I am not suprised. I enjoy seeing all the big stars and comedians who took bit parts in this movie.The only thing I don't like...most kids films with music/singing will have a bonus feature of the music scenes. It's a nice way to see the kids' favorite parts and only takes a few minutes if they want ""just one more"" show, song, story, etc. This DVD doesn't contain a music scene bonus feature.Definately worth the money if you are a child from the 70s raising children today."
1,Don't Buy Censored!,"Okay, I love this movie! I remember watching it as a child, many times, and loving it, but I can't support this edition. It is censored! I don't support ANYTHING that is censored (movies, music, art, etc.).So, I sadly have to say that I will not be owning a copy of The Muppet Movie until it is released uncensored. Maybe someday I'll be able to introduce this movie to my nieces. One can only hope."
3,Fun family film- lousy transfer.,"Watched the film last night, and it is as enjoyable as ever. As ridiculous as the story gets, and the fact that these are puppets, one still gets drawn into the story and comes to care about these characters.The down side is that the video transfer is completeley disappointing. The entire film appears washed out and grainy. Surely a better copy of the print must be available. Or maybe a digital restoration should be done.The movie appears especially bad when compared to the much higher deifinition extra feature- although with high def the characters look a little too much like the polar fleece that they are made from, and some characters color looks slightly off. It became distracting. It will be interesting to see how the new film looks, although the previews look promoising.I wondered how Disney would treat this franchise, and so far, I'm not impressed."
5,still wonderful even viewed through adult eyes !,I saw this movie when it first came out & enjoyed it... now that I have children I'm excited that they'll be able to enjoy it too ! Jim Henson was a wonderful creator.
3,Dissapointing transfer of a classic film,"This film is an excellent version of the muppets, the DVD, however is disappointing. The extras are minimal, and the grain is evident in the transfer.Why no director's narration? Or better yet...why not a narration from Fozzie Bear?If you already own it on video, don't bother. If you don't own it yet, of COURSE you need this."
4,A good indie rock debut with some nice appeal - genre fans will probably like it,"""This Up Here"" is a pretty solid debut that doesn't really break new ground, but you'll still like it. The singer is pretty recognizable and has a relatively good voice. The music sounds sort of like synth-influenced indie garage rock. The musicianship is pretty good, but nothing really great. There are no ""bad"" songs here, but some of them get a little annoying sometimes (the guitars are a little too much to handle at times - see ""Carnivalore"" for an example). Thankfully every track is relatively catchy and interesting (they know how to create a hook). The lyrics are usually hard to make out, but when you can hear them they aren't that worthy of analyzation. It's not one of the greatest CDs I've ever heard, but genre fans will still be satisfied with it. Slightly recommended.Highlights include:the entire album (if you can stand some of the noisier guitar parts)!"
4,A twist to the historical romance genre,"This was a great read because it is refreshing to see a woman who was born into the demimonde and still aspire to be ""normal"". I like the view of the world from the mother and her friends who try to make Gabrielle accept passion and not marriage. The seduction attempts were both interesting and touching at the same time. All in all, a good value for your money and definitely not a waste of time to read."
1,Amazon sent volume 1 and claim they do not stock volume 2,"My review is not about the book. In the description the book is said to have 2400 pages but I have received only volume 1 from Amazon. The CD Rom supplied with the book mentions a second volume. When I wrote to Amazon their response was that they did not stock ""the book I wanted"".I have contacted the publisher to buy only volume 2 but they quite rightly informed me that they do not break up the set and have refused to send me volume 2.I am awaiting a solution to this problem from Amazon."
5,Wonderful translation,"It is more than a little amusing to see reviewers stumbling over their tongues to comment on Aristotle. Volumes--no, entire libraries--have been dedicated to Aristotelian commentary. I doubt any prospective Amazon buyer cares what Joe Smith from Anytown, USA thinks of Aristotle. What would be helpful is an assessment of the particular translations.Hands down, Martin Ostwald's is, in my opinion, the best available. Well-annotated, with no interpretive essay to clutter the text, Ostwald immerses himself in the Athenian moral vocabulary, to our great benefit. Especially worthwhile is the glossary of oft-used, untranslatable ethical terms at the end of the book. Here, Ostwald clearly shows that the Greeks could convey in scant semantic space what it takes us an entire paragraph to even approximately explain."
5,Great book,"The book arrived fast and it looks like a new one. The book is great, good entertainment and I recommend it."
4,Pcongelliere,great book for classic leadership strategies and tactics. used in college and found Nichomachean Ethics to have profound effects on our culture of leadership in america.
1,I have another version of Auralog that was also a waste of money.,"Fortunately, I paid a lot less for my version. The descriptions give by the other reviewers sound very familiar. I am at the intermediate level and my complaint is the paucity of content. It took me very little time to exhaust, and thus memorize, all of the games, etc. I felt cheated as well."
1,A terrible program - don't buy under any circumstance,"First let me say that the reason I selected Tell Me More as my Mandarin language program was because of the good experience I've had with their German program. But this ... this is just a disaster. Unworkable, clunky, unhelpful. I've never thought of ""Tell Me More"" as a cry for help one might shout when running one of their programs, but that was my situation. I looked at this thing a hundred different ways, thinking I must be missing SOMETHING. Alas, it's just a poorly designed program unworthy of stealing, let alone purchase."
2,Software Quality,"A note about the ""look and feel"" of this software. When I loaded the software, I felt like I had been transported back into the 80's. Installation messages about graphics modes. Unsophisticated/flat graphics. No installation mode that allows the software to be run without the CDROM (so forget running out of the box on a laptop without a CDROM). If it were free, or maybe even $20 or $30, OK. But this for close to $200?"
5,A shocking novel of violence and cruel choices in a bloody underground war.,"Written by global traveler Allan Kahne, who has experienced firsthand the increasingly negative perception of America by the world at large, Fire With Fire is gripping novel of revenge and suspense. When Jake Burke's wife and daughter are slain in a terrorist attack on U.S. soil, he devotes his personal wealth to track down and execute the lone surviving bomber in Egypt. In the process, Jake and his assistant Miranda are swept into an operation run by rogue intelligence agents who dare to combat terrorism with tactics the government cannot use - fighting fire with fire. Though fictional, Fire With Fire draws heavily upon real people and real situations to present a chillingly believable threat, from suitcase nuclear bombs (eighty-four of which are currently still unaccounted for) to the past and present realities of Egypt, Israel, and Iran. A shocking novel of violence and cruel choices in a bloody underground war."
4,Thrilling but with a naive and slow ending,"I received the book as a gift and read it almost in one sitting.The plot is well conceived, credible but the ending was predictable and I am still wondering why there was a Miranda in the story.She was almost mute and did not help in any way the hero (only in their affair).One interesting thing in the book, and the reason why I gave it 4 stars, is that the author expressed his opinion about what is really happening in the Middle East and was not afraid to be politicaly incorrect, naming the things as they really are, which is not something we see everyday.The whole cenario may happen any day especially in the U.S. and the part of terrorism is credible enough."
5,Surprise,Actually found it to work well. Smoother ride and can tell there is a added boost in performance. I would buy again.
3,Not impressed.............,I bought the marvel mystery oil because of the positive reviews. I have to admit that I'm not that impressed by those claims made in previous reviews.
1,"I did not received the item, 1 week overdue",This is the second time I had trouble with a book order... I wish i had gone a different route.
2,Disappointed,"Read you guys' reviews and buy this. Upon receiving this I am disappointed. It is not worthy 30 dollars(plus shipping). The cover is made of some kind of cheaper materials. And it is really small. I measured it and it is not like the size claimed 13""x20"". I guess they measure it before filling in the buckwheat. But after filling buckwheat, it is not the same size. Not fit my neck, I will fall out this pillow when I turn over.Have not sleep on it yet, dont know it is comfortble or not."
1,BUG CONTAMINATION!,"I purchased 2 pillows from their website. Both were in the original packaging. I never opened either one. Before opening the packages, I was shocked to see hundreds of brown little bugs crawling everywhere! It was thoroughly disgusting. I sent both pillows back hoping for a full refund but was still charged $26. Needless to say, I highly recommend you look elsewhere unless you want bug contamination in your bedroom. Poor product and poor customer service!!! Very disappointed."
4,glad it's organic,"This is bigger than the ones bought in Japan so I had to take ALOT of hulls out of it, but it's a nice sleeper for sure. You have to get used to the noise of the hulls moving against each other but that's just par for all of them."
5,A Very Satisfied Customer,My physician recommended that I purchase a buckwheat pillow. I was most fortunate to find my orgnaic buckwheat pillow thru beans72.com on Amazon.com. The order was processed and shipped promptly. It arrived in perfect shape and is the most comfortable pillow I have ever owned....I even travel with it. It is worth every penny.
5,Excellent Pillow,"I have slept on these pillows for years and will never change. My head never gets hot at night and I don't wake up with back pain or a stiff neck. The once you start using this pillow, it will be extremely hard to sleep on anything else."
5,Buckwheat Pillow,This pillow is terrific. I've looked all over locally but couldn't find themso I was very relieved to find this on Amazon. The service was great also.Thanks for the good work.
4,Pillow is comfortable.,The pillow is really nice and comfortable. I like the well made cover. I thought it came with a free lavender but did not get it.
4,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Not the cheapest, but high quality - needs a bit of breaking in, but my old one (not from here) had turned to dust inside and I was used to the feel."
1,looks like I can't make bad reviews,"my last reviews was not approved by the website, that explains why this item has such a high rating(it only allows good words). I will make it short, this pillow is very small and light, you can't use it for sleeping, probably for massage only. The seller is not honest about this product, it says the shipping weight is 7 pounds, but with all the packaging stuff together, it's only less than 5 pounds. Don't buy it!"
2,Not soft,"I would not buy again, have not slept well using the plllow...If I was not lazy I would return, but I am lazy. I am very picky on my pillows, so take that into account when u read this review"
2,Good idea but not the size listed!,"I received this pillow and carefully measured it and it only measures 13"" x 19"" at most. It by no means measures 14"" x 20""!The idea/technology of a buckwheat pillow is nice in that you can control how flat it is by removing some of the buckwheat hulls and it seems to provide an nice stable support for your head while you sleep, yet is very comfortable.I don't think I trust this particular maker however give that the pillow I received is definitely smaller than advertised."
1,Uncomfortable!!,"Misleading and confusing review on this pillow. When it arrived, the packaging was ok, but when I opened the box...I see a small ....VERY SMALL pillow full of beads. Its very uncomfortable...I wouldnt use it. Straight to garbage! Do NOT BUY!"
2,Neck ache,"I would have benefited much more if this buckwheat pillow came with directions. It might seem bizarre to request directions for a pillow, bowever I purchased it to allieviate neck ache. After much testing my my neck is much better although it still hurts somee."
3,crunchy,hi - this product is noisywhen you put weight on it or move your head around - it makes noise because the buckwheat hulls are rubbing against each other. we have a quiet millet pillow so the noise of the buckwheat was a surprise to us. takes some getting used to
5,fantastic upgrade from the sobakawa pillow.,"i wish i purchased this sooner!i've been using my sobakawa pillow for almost ten years now, maybe longer.i figured it was time for a brand new pillow... and i definitely wanted to go organic and american made.beans72 had tons of great reviews and i thought, why not?i'm totally satisfied.the pillow is larger than what i expected, so i was able to remove the hulls and adjust it to the size i'm comfortable with.there is no smell, no off-gas, and the hulls feel so clean and so fresh... they're obviously superior in quality to the sobakawa.the case is thick and sturdy, and the zipper is such a genius feature.i appreciate the care guide that came with, as well.i'm definitely going to purchase the travel size and some extra cases/ticking for easy laundering.if you're an old sobakawa pillow user... it's seriously time for a change.upgrade with [...]!!!"
5,"""normal"" size buckwheat pillow","Huge neck pain before getting this pillow.This smaller size doesn't impact the comfort. I use it under my back, knee for side sleeping, or for guests...(Twin size used more regularly for my head, but the smaller one works just as well)I tried water pillows, foam, cotton, tempurpedic, etc before this product, including 3 chiropractic pillows. Nothing is as comfortable and supportive. Even my eyeballs feel relaxed! (I'm serious!) It turns a crappy mattress into great support just by a pillow! (It makes sense though when you consider animals and baby's body positioning being determined by neck support...see Alexander Technique)I have fantasies of adopting or fostering children just so they can try my kid-sized pillow!Now I just want more of them...and free shipping!"
5,comfortable,"I tried many different kind of pillows since I have neck problem.Finaly I found the best one. I wake up every morning, I don't have any pain for my neck and sleep very well every day. I recommend this pillow."
4,Takes getting used to,"I'd used a contoured foam neck pillow that was very comfortable but lost its firmness over a relatively short period of time. Therefore I decided to try something new. The buckwheat husks make for a VERY firm, somewhat noisy sleep. Nevertheless, once I settle down to sleep, it provides good support and I no longer notice the noise. Another benefit is that the buckwheat pillow doesn't get hot like foam or polyester pillows. I've only slept on it for a month, so don't know how long it will last. Stay tuned ..."
1,Bugs!,"I ordered this product almost 8 months earlier this year to replace a pillow purchased a couple of years ago. I didn't open the packaging because I didn't need it immediately and I am very glad that it was in a sealed plastic bag. I went to pull it out yesterday and noticed an immense amount of ""dust"" inside the bag and fortunately took a closer look before ripping open the bag. The ""dust"" was moving and was actually tiny bugs crawling around inside the bag. I'm not sure what type of bugs these were - they are tiny and off-white in color - but needless to say this pillow went out in the trash. I'm very disappointed by this waste..."
5,Great Pillow - Love the smell of nature,Just wanted to leave a comment to support positive comments- All positive reviews mentioned are true- I just brough the item and used it for weeks. It solved my neck and flipping around problem :) Go ahead and disregard the negative reviews since maybe 100 our of 1 will post negative reviews with no experience.
2,BUCKWHEAT PILLOW,THE PILLOW IS SMALL AND OVERFILLED WHICH MAKES IT VERY HARD. I'VE REMOVED A LOT OF THE CONTENTS (OVER HALF) AND IT IS STILL NOT VERY COMFORTABLE. I'VE STOPPED USING IT. IT IS EXACTLY AS ADVERTIZED--JUST A MATTER OF TASTE I GUESS. THE QUALITY OF THE MERCHANDISE IS FINE.
4,great pillow,"I've been using this pillow for over 2 months and my neck and shoulders feel much better. Before this pillow, I would buy so many pillows (memory comfort, down, etc.) to find one that is good for my neck. I stare at a computer all day and am probably tense. At night, I could never get comfortable. Since I got this pillow, I don't notice my neck anymore."
3,Cannot live without Buckwheat Hull pillow,I absolutely will NEVER be without a buckwheat hull pillow. Since I love mine so much I got one for my adult son and one for my husband for Christmas. The filling is GREAT (there was so much filling that we had to take some out and reserve it for when the pillow becomes a bit older and needs a refill) but the covering fabric is very stiff and crunchy. I am hoping that the fabric will soften up over time. Also another company that I bought a buckwheat hull pillow from included a pillowcase this company did not although the price was comparative.
3,very stuffed pillow,"If you enjoy a pillow that is so overstuffed that your head can not sink into,this is for you. I am in the process of spilling out the contents in order for my head to rest on the pillow comfortably. I'm optimistic that eventually I will be successful"
1,Not good pillow,"My Girlfriend got this pillow. It's very hard, it's loud, and its not particularly comfortable.I'm not sure who would like a pillow like this, but I certainly don't."
1,Pricey,"This is a pricey product, nothing great, nothing special. would not buy again, but thats just my opinion. was pretty small."
2,Crunch Crunch,"That's the sound these pillows make when you put your head on it. It was so loud, and uncomfortable (like a hay pillow) that I returned them."
3,its okay,"if you already own one of these you know what to expect- if not it will take you a few weeks to get used to it because its really hard, but it will eventually grow in you."
4,Do I like it?,"I have a really bad neck problem and that is why I bought this pillow. It is beautifully made. I have to admit it takes some time getting used to it, it is nothing like any pillow I have used before. I find I wish I could have designed it with my neck in mind. I need it just a bit higher in the neck area and lower where the head lays. This is all really my issue. I am sure if I did not have this bad neck I would be saying it is the greatest pillow I have ever used."
2,Buckwheat Pillow,"The pillow is extremely LOUD. It is encased in a paper sack, and every time I move the pillow makes a ton of noise- I wake up it is so loud! This is not a sufficient sack,and I feel that I wasted my money (I have bought buckwheat pillows before- never had this problem)."
1,dont know I never recieved the correct item,"This is the worst company (BEANS72) that i have ever delt with. i ordered the 14x20 buckwheat pillow and recieved a 11x16 pillow, but was charged for the larger pillow. When I called the company to correct this they told me i had to call Amazon, which i did and Amazon told me i had to contact the seller, again which i did, again they said that they couldnt help me and that i had to call Amzazon. I asked them to connect me to their customer service and they told me they could not, i asked for the phone # and they said that they didnt know it. ( they dont even know the phone # where they work??) I guess Amazon is taking care of the problem, will have to wait and see. would not recommend ordering from BEANS72!Also Amazon shouldnt outsource their operators, they are hard to understand and vice versa."
3,Organic Buckwheat Pillow,I bought this on a whim and out of curiosity. I like it but I do not use it all the time. I wish i could find pillowcases in that size.
4,"Visually beautiful book with accessible, interesting recipes","I was first drawn to this book by its wonderful photography showing landscapes and people of West Texas, the writing style is comfortable and drew me into the story of cowboy cooking. The recipes are all very accessible, Texas cowboy comfort food! but not quite what you might expect to roll off the chuckwagon. The variety of recipes is surprisingly strong, and are all accomplishable by everyday cooks and beginners. The sidebbars scattered throughout the book give a good sense of ranch life. This one will be in my kitchen book shelf a while!!"
3,Theo,Being a fan of Theo Bikel I loved the book. But at the same time I know that it was not deep or really informative. It is in the vein of the usual autobio's of stars who must tell how great they are and who they know.
5,Simply elegant,"Buying things slowly, I have the Duchesse collection wine glasses and iced beverage goblets. Bought two sets of these toasting flutes for special occasions and are thrilled with the product and the price. Bought in conjunction with a 4-for-3 promotion through Amazon and they arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Adds elegance to our romantic dinners! Don't fear buying crystal or glass, Amazon stands by anything they send. Would buy again for sure."
5,Excellent Condition!,My All Creatures Great and Small: The Complete Series 1 Collection DVD arrived in excellent condition and fast too - just as if I had just bought it at a store brand new. I plan on purchasing the remaining James Herriot series on DVD the same way.
3,Great series,"All Creatures Great and Small (the first 13 episodes) is a must see for James Heriot fans. The one disappointment is that the 4th DVD is flawed. Straight out of the box the DVD player registered ""disk dirty."" Not sure what the problem is."
1,"All Creatures Great and Small, Series 1, Volume 1,","We were unable to view this DVD on our regular DVD and the European DVD player, it just said ""NO DISC"" no matter what we did. I wish they would have specified more clearly that it was not the American version. We're old people, so maybe we missed something. SO disappointed as tonight was movie night with the grandkids and this was what we were going to watch. After 45 minutes of trying everything we could think of, we gave up."
4,mixed,"I love this series. The case,holding 4 CDs, was falling apart. The condition of the CDs was ok. There were some spots that would 'freeze' but after I had played the CDs a few times that stopped."
5,James Herriot is an big hit all over the world.,"Back in the 70's this tv serie was a huge hit.It still is now cause it's timeless.All the actors gives warmth in their play.It's a family spirit to watch James Heriot the veterinary in the great Yorkshire Dales.Peter Davison (Tristan)brings a lot of humor in his role and Christopher Timothy (plays James Herriot)has the same humor when he drinks to much beer.The problems with the animals and the solutians of the three vets are joyful to see.After all these years the TV series ""All Creatures Great & Small"" is a must seen ! (what about trickie woo......)"
4,"Love the books, enjoying the tv series","I read the James Herriott books many years ago and really loved them. They made me laugh until I cried. The tv shows have done a good job of staying true to the books, but I will always prefer the books just because I so enjoy the way he writes."
2,Terrible tone from great guitars and amplifiers,"This DVD features legendary Fender guitars and amplifiers. I was hoping to hear how these wonderful instruments sound from a good guitar player. Well Jim does play great guitar. The instruments, amps are fantastic. So what is the problem? The tone he gets from these wonderful instruments are horrific. He even manages to murder the tone of Fender Jazzmaster when he attempts to play surf music. I never thought a Jazzmaster can sound so bad... thanks Jim. He does show a few tricks of legendary guitar players like James Burton, Roy Buchanan. But the tone he gets is so horrible that they all sound alike, like a broken children's guitar."
1,Just horrible,"I bought these headphones thinking they would be pretty decent because of the price. And they work great except for one thing. They should come complete with a roll of black electrical tape. I've had these for about a month now and the wire cover has split everywhere, exposing the wires inside. Now I'm not an expert in electronics, but I'm guessing this is a bad thing. So my advice to you is, if you decide to purchase these headphones, buy a roll of black electrical tape to go with them."
1,"A Shocking Price, But A Shock Nevertheless","I used these phones for a week or two and noticed a sligt ""popping"" noise every now and then. Then one call and I got a wicked shock from a frayed wire.They are in file 13 along with other ""must have"" gizmos."
4,Look and Feel is fine,I have received this just have a backup because my earlier one was little slippery in the hand.Mine is blue in color and I feel it in the hand when I hold it and may not slip.There are no openings for volume and power button so far no issues in operating those buttons.I was expecting it to little thicker so that it could save my phone if I drop from a pocket or jacket but I doubt it would save the phone.I may not use the stand to watch anything on the phone but it works.Backside is transparent and I like it that way.Overall for the price I paid I am fine with it and I might change if I find something else if that can save my phone from a drop.
4,Make what you already know better (it may save your life).,"""Well sure, our art is good for self-defense."" If you've heard that from your instructor or if you believe that about your art, if you study martial arts for their self-defense benefit (even if self-defense is not your primary focus), AND if your ""real fight"" experience is limited at best, then you need to read this book. Surprisingly, it is not one of those books that tears down everything you've worked so hard to learn. Rather it builds on what you already know, broadens your thinking (beyond the dojo or tournament scene), and prepares you for the ""unexpected"" (about the only thing you can ""expect"" in a real fight). You don't have be in a lot of fights to learn this stuff -- as long as you're smart enough to learn it from someone who has."
3,Good Defnsive Book,When I purchased this book I was hoping it would help me better prepare for a street fight. I think this book is a great mental primer and is very entertaining to read. However if you art emphasizes kicking this book is not very helpful.
1,taking it to the street: making your martial arts street eff,"This is not a good book, the information contained within will give you a false sense of security that will get you seriously hurt or killed, I think this author to be a self-aclaimed expert with an ego problem, if you are looking for an excellent book on how to defend yourself, based on REALITY, try Streetwise by Peter Consterdine"
5,Must-have for anyone interested in aviation,"Even though I've watched many documentaries on the subject, I have to say this DVD set expanded my knowledge tremendously. It incudes videos I've never seen before. This is a great collection of aviation history and it will be of interest to any history buff looking to add to their collection. Having seen the entire footage I can say that I'm very pleased with my purchase, it was totally worth taking the time to watch it."
1,Disappointing,"I was deeply disappointed by this DVD set. After reading the description, I believed I was ordering a balanced, representative viewpoint from both the civilian and military side of historical aviation. However, what I received out of the 23 hours of advertised ""non-stop flight action"" was a pathetic one hour (not even that much) of a 1909 Wright Brothers Flyer, and the rest nearly all military-based. I realize that numerous aviation developments came from government-funded, military needs, but I was hopeful that there would be more from a civilian standpoint, too."
4,A different path....,"I love reading books like this. Having been raised in capitalist America, and properly educated that I must out-work, out-earn, and out-consume my neighbors to find true happiness I found this book challenges my chosen (indoctrinated?) lifestyle.Pedersen tells the story of taking 10 years to tour the world on his BMW motorcycle. Finances and career are secondary, and somehow things always work out. He finds that in spite of significant cultural and political differences, we have more in common than may be apparent. No matter where he finds himself, human kindness and hospitality see him through.Good pictures, great adventure, and a good challenge to the equation that consumption equals happiness."
2,10 years on two wheels,"Great photography, contents most disappointing. Just not very well written and lacks detail on visiting so many countries. Book was put together in a hurry to just earn some money."
2,Where's The Beef?,"A beautiful coffee-table book for the casual observer, but lacking in substantive passion for the motorcycle. The reader is told various details about this adventure in a dry manner, as if one is telling about eating breakfast. And there's no ""thread"" to keep the interest. Nothing seems to tie in with the previous subject or event.Grand photography, though, but a lot of money for this visual tour."
3,Not quite that great,"Sorry, this book is not that great. You get a very brief one or two page article about each country. You don't really learn much about the author, the country, or motorcycling.He is also an American hater. Whining about how we ravaged the Indians, the buffalo, etc. He is drawn to the poverty of third worlders and disgusted by the plenty of the American lifestyle. Hiroshima is a tragedy but no mention of Pearl Harbor.Like a lot of Europeans he hates America but forgets if it wasn't for us he would be goosestepping around the platz every morning."
3,Slightly boring,"I got this book for free, and I am a little dissopointed with it. one of the main characters was suposed to be a computer/tech geek, though by the level of computer information he gave, I doubt he knew what a BIOS is, let alone what the difference was between DDR3-1333 & DDR2-800 memory.One of the things in the book is jumping through the internet. IF THIS BOOK WAS NOT WRITTEN BY A CHRISTIAN AUTHOR, THEN THIS BOOK WOULD NOT BE CLEAN. The author stayed away from the bad stuff on the internet (if catch my drift) so I did like that. Over all, if you are age 8-12, I think you would find this book enjoyable. Otherwise, you might want to save your money."
5,Pure aggression,This album is awesome. Its fast and clean. Jared Anderson shows people that he is a multi talented musician with Book Of Lambs.This album is brutal/ very heavy and well recorded.
2,Needs Work,"My experience is consistent with the previous reviewer's. The razor's edge needed careful reworking before it even approached a usable state. (I used an ad hoc sequence of fine oil stones, followed by abrasive papers up to 8000 grit, with water, on a piece of float glass, before stropping.)At first I thought it was me. I used a straight razor, cluelessly, 30 years ago, and am trying to teach myself how to use one correctly now. I tried this razor and gave up for months, until it occurred to me that I had nothing to lose by trying to sharpen it. The visible grinding marks on the edge should have been a clue; the problem was NOT me!I'm giving this product two stars because I got mine at a local beauty supply shop for $10. If I had known it was not really a finished product, that would have been a good deal, in context. If you have any idea how to sharpen something like this, $27.99 isn't bad. Make your mistakes with something like this, and then look for something fancier!"
2,I finished this desite the book itslef,"I wasn't looking for political correctness or even adept writing, but the boring rambles of the self-important Sherman just couldn't entertain."
3,The first several chapters were great.,"The highlight of the book was the chapter ""Conversation with a Lama"". I found the rest of the book, from section TWO on, simply seemed like the reminiscece of an old hippie. I would buy the book for section ONE, and throw the rest away."
4,Would recommend,"I really liked how light weight and durable this stroller is. The only problem I have with it is that the foot release, to break it down, is a little tough. I love the color and it reclines back (not a lot) so my son can sleep."
1,Don't waste your money on this item!,"We recently did an extensive remodel of our kitchen and thought this would be a great addition. Unfortunately, as soon as we drilled the holes in our new cabinets to install it, we were sorry. The sound quality is so poor we had to turn it up full volume to understand it, and then it rattles. Note: the advertised size of the screen is not the picture you actually get - it's 2"" smaller and poor quality. The 90-day warranty just ran out and the picture wouldn't come on unless you tapped the box. Now it won't come on at all. I would say this is an expensive disposable tv."
5,Under Counter TV,"THis TV is working great so far. It is a real space saver for a small kitchen. It is an LCD screen so sometimes as you change the angle from which you see it , the picture quality varies. But overall, we are very happy with it. We haven't even played the radio yet, but it is there."
3,Under Cabinet TV,"Transaction was Spot On... Other than the screen being small it is a good product. Receive years of good service. Only replaced it for a, larger, 14"" screen. A diffent brand as Audiovox didn't offer one."
4,Smells great,"Good soap formulation, real lemongrass smell -- I only wish it was more of a rectangle bar shape, because it would be easier to hold. Plus these flat soaps seem to dissolve pretty quickly. But it's the best smelling lemongrass soap I've found on Amazon, so I'll buy again."
4,Lemony fresh scent!,"Pamper yourself with the soothing scent of lemon in a long lasting soap. Lathers well, rinses completely and does not dry the skin. You and your guests will love this quality soap."
5,Excellent All Natural Soap,"This is a very moisturizing soap. Also, you can see the all natural ingredients including the strands of lemongrass. I highly recommend this soap as it's all natural. This may dry out your skin if you have dry skin, but, it's really good for acne."
4,great dvd,"I just bought this dvd a few days ago, and i've yet to finish watching it. with tons of concert footage, videos for 'king of the closet', 'pitiful', 'all of us', etc, photo slideshows, and a documentary showing blindside's 10 year journey, it is a great buy. i only question how many times i need to see blindside perform the same song. the concert energy is perfectly captured. it's pretty sweet."
4,Rubinstein and Brahms/Beethoven Concertos,"This is probably one of my favorite recording of the Brahms D Minor Concerto. Rubinstein has a wonderful ability to bring out the beauty of this concerto. One can truly see Rubinstein's amazing ability to color this artistically difficult concerto. The Beethoven 3rd concerto is also magnificent but it would sometimes go a little too much on the romantic side for my taste. Overall, this video is a must for a library of Classical videos."
5,Fragrant Volume,"I have to say I was very impressed with this conditioner! It gives your hair so much body, and doesn't weigh it down at all. This has been the best as far as organic conditioners that I have found. I highly recommend it! Plus the scent will just make you melt!"
2,Doesn't live up to the cover.,"I found this book a lot of fluff, and am quite disappointed that I actually spent money on it. I was taken in by the beautiful cover and lovely illustrations. It could have and should have been much more."
4,Plush airline toy,"Another great plush airplane to add to Baby's ""aviator"" nursery! Collect them all!! Shipping was prompt and arrived as described."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"This book is a joke. Apart from the typos and syntax errors, the content is weak.There is very little information regarding doing business on the course, just golf etiquitte in general and stories about people who happened to have some success building business relationships.I got the distinct impression that the authors would rather have written a book on their history of covering pros, but decided that a book on business on the course would sell better."
2,my advice is to keep looking,"This book is not for the non-golfer looking for reasons to take up the game. Full of golf lingo and references to past tournaments (you *do* remember the surprise ending of the Such-and-Such tournament in 1988, don't you?), it will leave new golfers scratching their heads wondering what's the point of most of the stories presented here. Other than that, the book is very poorly written and even more poorly edited, with far more than its share of misspelled words, run-on sentences and sentence fragments. Certainly there is a need for books on how to conduct business on the golf course, but there have to be better books than this one on the subject. My advice is to keep looking."
4,Excellent Book!,"Playing golf with a client or prospect is an excellent way to develop a relationship with that person. By getting to know a person better, it increases your chances of strengthening your business relationship and creates new business opportunities.Playing a round of golf enables you to spend at least 4 hours with a client or prospect, instead the hour or so for breakfast or lunch. It also takes them away from the distractions of their business.This book is an excellent source of information about using golf to develop business relationships. For those who have never played golf with clients or prospects, this book offers almost all the information you will need on how to do it. It will also be very valuable for new golfers who have been invited to play in a business related setting.I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to do the right things when playing business golf. It can keep you from ever embarrassing yourself!"
2,"Cute, but disappointed","This costume is very cute but I was disappointed for many reasons. The skirt is definitely not as long and full as the picture shows. We did fluff it up after shipping, stretched out the tulle, but still no where as shown on the picture. The size is VERY small. This won't fit my 3 year old at all. Sizing on the packaging would have been helpful if it was listed on the amazon listing. Probably would have helped me decide on what size to buy. It will fit my 2 year old. The arm holes are VERY small and tight. I don't know what 3 or 4 year old could have worn it. I had to take it to a person to cut the elastic and re-sew the arms just to fit my 2 year old. The workmanship is very poor also. The seams around the crotch area are all crooked. Definitely not top-notch product here. It's fine for dress-up around the house."
1,Poor Chinese Quality (again),This steamer lasted only about 10 uses and the metal steam chamber cracked. The stuff from China is cheap. But it's also garbage.
2,Great at beginning but failed in the end...,"I bought this steamer for my boyfriend last November as a birthday gift and he loved it! However, by late spring, the arm on the steamer began to bend since it is located right next to the hot water area. Now, in August, the steamer won't heat up at all! $80 down the drain and it hasn't even been a year yet. It did start out great but gradually declined. I would recommend shopping around."
3,Perfume set,Smells a bit different from my last 2 bottles. Not sure if formula changed? Drys down nicely but has a strange smell when first sprayed on.
5,wildwood flower,I have been a john and june carter cash fan since they joined have been a johnny cash fan for fifty years and I am coming up on sixty years old in july am also a big fan of rosanne tennessee flat topox has always been my favorite wondering if wildwood flower is is on cd or cassette the song and others
3,Save Your Money -- Not Their Best Work,"This is a good period for both of them, and there are a few standout tracks (the hit ""Jackson,"" ""Long-legged Guitar Pickin' Man""), but the rest of this record is unfortunately filled with low-grade Johnny. You all have heard this type of stuff from him, so you probably know what I am talking about. ""Beans for Breakfast,"" the MCA 80s period, that sort of thing.Personally, I am no fan of their hit remake of ""It Ain't Me Babe,"" but that's hardly the worst cover of the bunch. Johnny's tuneless vocal on ""I Got a Woman,"" and their beatless cover of ""What I'd Say"" are strong contenders for that crown.And let's just pretend these giants never recorded ""Shantytown,"" a song so bad that, coupled with the novelty track ""Fast Boat to Sydney,"" will make you yearn for any one of at least two dozen records by Cash that is a heck of lot better than this one.I'd take a pass and keep poring through their catalog -- there's much better stuff out there."
2,ill-advised covers...,"The first cut, Long-legged Guitar Pickin' Man is a fine start, but it's downhill from there, especially with such ill-advised covers as It Ain't Me Babe and What'd I Say."
4,The land of geysers,"A beautiful book. Get insight into the delicate ecosystem, the people and the wildlife in this amazing natural wonder."
3,The sequal to Survivors ST-TNG #4,"What is unique about this book is that it is the first ""giant"" book to be released, as well as being a sequal to a previous book. Of course, this was before the Hardcover books started coming out and before there were any miniseries. A good read, but make sure you read Survivors #4 first!"
2,Great music.......bad singer,"First and foremost the music is excellent. However I can not figure out why such a talented group of musicians would choose such a poor lead singer. His voice ruins the listeners experience. I tried as hard as I good to get passed his voice but it was so bad on some tracks I had to laugh. The music, think Dragonforce meets Helloween with a poor....imitation of new Avenged Sevenfold style signing (which I can't stand)....overall save your money."
4,REAL Power-Metal from AMERICA,"Actually with one Eastern European and one Brazillian, they are not technically ""American"" through and through. So what, this Nebraska-based outfit kicks it live. I've seen them live twice and they deliver the goods, no matter what the previous bored-with-metal-looking-for-something-new reviewer said. If you like it hard and fast, you'll dig this set, and if you see their name on a list for upcoming shows, you'll do yourself a favor and catch 'em live. Full-on energy."
4,Nebraska? Debut? I can't believe this,"This debut from Nebraskan Power Metal group, Cellador is mind blowing. From the guitar intro of 'Leaving All Behind' to the 7 minute epic 'Seen Through Time' all the way to the last solo of 'No Chances Lost' this is a really epic piece of work. I can't imagine some band from the middle of nowhere( sorry for people who live there), can create such power metal with european influences clearly embedded in their music. It's just shocking. Honestly, i picked up this CD by chance. I listened to half of 'never again' on the radio, and i was very impressed by their musicianship. I bought the cheap cd and put it in my cd player and i was just.... i think you get the idea. Buy the CD if you like Iron Maiden, All That Remains, Dragonforce, Kamelot, Iced Earth and etc."
4,Awesome!!,"I disagree with the last review. This album pumps me up like no other!! The whole album is at blasting speed beginning to end similar to Dragonforce, but reminds me more of Helloween with blast beats or even some Stratovarius really. Could have used some keyboards and also the production is pretty dry but I love the aggressiveness and overall catchiness of the songs. Good for a debut album!"
5,WWII Thriller that is Impossible to Put Down!,In 1944 Hitler makes a last desperate effort to halt the American armies through secret assassinations. This World War II thriller is based on a true German operation and is impossible to put down.
1,3rd rate,"Felt like a cheap WWII tv movie.I recommend Peter Temple's Identity Theory, The Broken Shore........"
1,No Good,"Wow, not really the type of book I thought it would be. I was suprememly disappointed, especially with the twist."
5,Out of this World,"Don't hesitate to buy this album, i bought it right away after sampleing the songs on his website. Beautiful album, amazing voice."
5,I love this artist.,I'm just a normal person (who doesn't really know much about music and it's politic sides). I really like this album for thousands of unexplainable reasons. That's all.
4,Bright Future,"Not only is Sondre extremely talented, he is also very funny. When I saw him at Schuba's in Chicago back in Feb 2002, Sondre, playing by himself, said to the crowd, ""I'm going to attempt to play you some rock"" then asked ""What is the penalty in this country for 'attempted rock'??"" Actually, it was the first time I had even heard of Sondre Lerche, and I made it a point to not forget his name. I just purchased Faces Down about a month ago, and I was not disappointed. I'm going to spread the word as much as I can, and hopefully Sondre will continue to record great albums."
5,A great debut album,"Norwegian-born singer/songwriter Sondre Lerche has a clean sound, just guitars, some strings, drums, a great voice and intelligent lyrics. Nothing like the over-produced, electronic-infused pop most people hear on US radio today. A very refreshing change. Some of the best songs on this CD are ""Dead passengers,"" ""You know so well,"" ""Virtue and wine,"" and ""No one's gonna come."" Plus, the US release of the CD contains a wonderful bonus track called ""Rosebud"" and the video for ""You know so well."" A great CD!!"
5,2004 Honda VTX 1300C,Installed it on my 04 VTX1300C and looks just like it does in the picture. The only downside is that it does rust easily if you don't have a garage and store your bike outside.
5,I'M AMAZED BY THE QUALITY OF THIS CD-R!!!,"I threw away all my SONY CD-R's because I was duped. MAM-A CD-R's really do set the standard for quality and intregity. I burned my first CD and I could see and hear the difference. Labeling this from my CASIO CR75 looked darker and complete, versus the hard texture surface from SONY. SONY has great products, but after losing data from several discs I decided to try this, and both CD's I've burned have been exceptional. I will buy MAM-A Mitsui Cd's from Amazon in the future. Nothing but the best for my music. Peace - JG"
3,Needs bigger magnet.,The magnet is not strong enough. If you get too much in the holder it falls off. Would be great if had a stronger or bigger magnet.
2,customer service,The saw arrived but before we could change the blade (it comes with a ripping blade) we had to figure out how to get out a tri wing (Y shaped) screw. We called service number on the booklet that came with saw and they did not know anything about it and in 3 days have not called us back. We ended up buying a special driver for it. It also was not assembled properly and had to be reassembled to make it work.The moter is very strong and good though and is the reason we have not sent it back.
5,Mandatory Reading,"This is the most comprehensive guide to pricing illustration and graphic design available. If you are a professional or thinking of becoming one, then this book provides the kind of in depth information you need to run a successful business. GET IT TODAY.It's not a how-to... there are plenty of those around.WHAT IT IS is a detailed resource of the tools you need to sell your work for a fair price and retain the rights to that work. Sample contracts are provided that cover a variety of situations from an artist-rep agreement to a Multimedia job order confirmation.Next time you ask ""what do I charge for that?!?!?"", turn to this book. It'll save your business and repay the cost of purchase many many times over."
3,Why Such Ugly Covers from Graphics Professionals?,"In the graphics industry, communication is the name of the game. There's no point having a message if your intended audience can't read it. Why on God's green earth, then, are the covers to both this edition and the previous one so hideous? It's like a Where's Waldo maze just to make out the name of the book! Both covers are horrible examples of graphic design, and it doesn't speak well to what the art buyers must be paying good money for. Now, once you get past the cover to the inside, here is good information, somewhat generalized, about the prices publishing companies, newspapers, ad agencies and the like in New York City are charging for their artists. Those of us outside that zone will have to adjust accordingly, I suppose. So my suggestion is to buy the book, rip off the front and back cover and make one of your own. It's bound to be better than what the ""pro""s have done."
1,why follow rules?,"rules are meant to be broken! dont follow this book, dont follow any graphic design ""rule"" book. dont buy it!"
3,Worth the money,"Overall, I'm not disappointed with this purchase. The performances are a bit inconsistent, though. A number of the symphonies are well done -- I especially enjoyed the 4th symphony here, and the 5th is generally good, too. The 8th, on the other hand, is a low spot of the set. Unfortunately, it's one of the best symphonies written by Shostakovich (particularly the first movement). I know it's hard to tune an Eb clarinet when it's that high, but come ON..."
5,buy it!!!!,"Randy, you're the man... This CD rocks! Whether you've always been into break beats, or just gettin into it, this CD is a must have. Well mixed, and well produced. Not to mention the fact that all the tracks are original. Do yourself a favor and pick it up now!!! Cell block 90 forever....."
1,nasty,"i thought this product was nasty it smelled terrible,musky it actually kept my husband away dont fall for this one!!!"
2,"Not impressed, not my style!","The book is OK. Photos are not all that great (some blurry and out of focus, obviously amature). Most of the dolls are modern and mass produced. I was hoping that there would be more artist creations, one of a kinds, limited editions, and antiques. Instead there are a bunch of plastic/vinyl manufactured dolls with just a few quality pieces sprinkled in. I only recommend this if you collect that style of doll (manufactured/mass-produced)."
5,ONE OF MY MOST TREASURED POCESSIONS,THIS BOOK IS LONG AWAITED AND NEEDED FOR THE DOLL COLLECTOR.I AM A BLACK DOLL COLLECTOR AND UNTIL NOW HAVE NOT BEEN ABLETO FIND ANY BOOK ON BLACK DOLL COLLECTING. IT IS VERY INFORMATIVE AND ENTERTAINING. I WILL TREASURE THIS BOOK AS I DO MY BLACK DOLL COLLECTION. THANK YOU MS GARRETT FOR WRITING THISBOOK. IN MY OPINION IT SHOULD BE A BEST SELLER. I CAN'T PUT ITDOWN. IT'S SOAKING UP KNOWLEDGE OF BLACK DOLL COLLECTING. IT EXPLAINS THE ART OF BLACK DOLL COLLECTING SO ELEGANTLY. THANK YOUAGAIN FOR SHARING YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF COLLECTING WITH US.NANCY JOHNSONJACKSON MSWLBD
1,Simply terrible,This movie just plain sucks. I got it to see Ahmo Hight but the scene are just terrible.
5,Fantastic quality!,Just opened the package...Very soft sheets! I can't wait to sleep on them! They're beautiful! Definitely worth the money!
1,300 thread sheet set ad,"I just received this ad for Embellished Edge 300-Thread-Count 100% Cotton Queen Sheet Set, Ivory- when I went to order it says ""not available""- why did I receive the ad?? No other product was advertised????"
4,Great Sci-Fi that leaves you wanting more.,"I decided to give this one a try because it was free at Baen, and wow, what a surprise. Great book of Short novellas that covers a broad range of ideas. I usually like full length novels, but this one has changed my perspective a bit. Will definitely be looking into more Laumer books b/c of this one.[...]"
5,this book pushes every button,"BRANDED T is amazing. It keeps you captive from beginning to end. This book is provocative, real, graphic, and intense. It's a personal story and a text book. It's [] provocative and it's spiritual. Pass it on!"
4,Almost a hero...,"Credit must be given to the author for exposing major parts of her life as it takes great courage to tell the world of our secrets, our past and our dark sides.Experiencing a life on the street as a prostitute, a peep-show girl and a drug user yet working hard to be loved and to advance in life through college and education. The author had a life of constant struggle and at the same time lived a life that was guided by her own sexual desires and fantasies. Some things have changed over the years but her promiscuity is still well engrained in her life style - I know!I highly recommend the book as the author has done us all a great service and we should all learn from this incredible passage."
5,Fantastic,"As a newcomer to macrobiotics, I absolutely loved this book and have used it every day since I bought it. It outlines easy, quick basic recipes that anyone can make - most of which involve few basic ingredients.Everything down to how to make basic brown rice is in here. I am so blessed I happened to get this book in the beginning. After now having read some of the other macrobiotic books, I realize I might have been frustrated by the foreign ingredients and complicated recipes and been turned off from macrobiotics otherwise.One thing I did when I bought this book (as I was just slowly learning macro foods and starting to introduce them to my cupboards) is sift through the book and start noting common themes of ingredients. After identifying and buying some of the ""base"" products identified, I was able to make several different recipes. These recipes make up my diet today and every day.I would recommend this book to anyone, especially beginners like me."
2,Changing seasons,Didn't really like..Nutrition factors should have been noted at the bottom.Also with macrobiotic cooking you spend alot of time cooking. Too much salt as well.
5,Worked surprisingly well,"I previously used one of the electric ones to change the oil in my 4.3l Mercruiser engine and it was horrible. It took over an hour and then never worked again. Given the good reviews and low price of this hand pump, I gave it a try. To my surprise, it sucked all the oil out in less than 5 minutes. I was very impressed as to how well it worked. There's no priming or anything, just start pumping it and it moves the oil very quickly. I didn't even warm up the engine either and I run 20w50 oil in it! Highly recommend."
4,Handy Pump,"I would have given it 5 stars , but want to see how long it will last . I have only used it a hand full of times . Quality looks good , but time will tell . I feel it is good value for the price ."
5,Did the job,"Pump worked great,Very pleased with it,Did what it was ment to do. Only bad thing is the drain tube wish it was a little longer."
4,Protect your investment!,"The newer, brighter screens on the Tungstens and Zire 71 are also softer. They scratch easily. My Tungsten T3 was showing marks on the common areas of the screen within a few weeks. Unfortunately, I didn't get these from the very beginning. At least now it wont get any worse.A little difficult to apply, but if you carefully apply one edge first and slowly roll it on while smoothing with the included cloth, you can get it on perfectly. It will make the screen slightly less bright and can look poorly when the palm is off, but when the palm is on they are unnoticeable. Believe me. As the owner of at least 8 different Palm models, this is an excellent investment in your $300+ Palm. Get em!"
2,Cutting your own screen protector,"I've been using screen protectors from Palm (now PalmOne) and other brands for a long time. I bought a T3 and my surprise, when I got the screen protector pack was the need to cut myself the protector. Or you have a precise use of scissors or your work will look bad in your palm. I'm not happy, but right now for T3 people have no options.Otherwise I would prefer (even paying extra bucks) a pre-cutted protectors."
4,so fun,"i picked up ""hallo liebes leben"" when i was in germany a couple months ago. so fun. if you really want it, and are having trouble finding it, i can probably hook you up with a burned cd. (amiramarion@aol.com)"
5,Good Book on Chicanos in Prison,"This book is a good book on how the life of 'Chicanos' is in San Quinten. I was more interested in gathering information on the origins of the 'Mafia' that was formed and gathering quotes, but overall it is a good book on the subculture of the everyday life of what Chicanos live in prison."
3,"Cute, but small","This item turned out to be much smaller than I had initially anticipated, but seems to be of good quality."
5,Used as a giveaway at a trade show that tied in with our theme. Everyone loved them.,"We used this woolly doll as a giveaway at a trade show that tied in with our theme. We had some excited winners. Everyone loved them. They are 8 inches, very soft and huggable. Overall response was great on these."
4,Mammoth Discovered,"My daughter wanted a wooly mammoth for Christmas. It is an unconventional toy so I looked for it online. Most of the mammoths that I saw were very cute, but not very realistic looking. The Everett Wooly Mammoth was cute, cuddly, and realistic looking for the price. It is only 8"" and looked smaller in the box. But it didn't upset my daughter. She loved it completely!"
5,My 9 year old loves it!,"I bought this toy as an aid for teaching math to my daughter. Math stresses her out, and this toy, which I introduced to her as ""Professor M. A. Moth"" has been very helpful in keeping her stress level down while she is working on learning and practicing math concepts. It's small enough (about 6 inches tall) that she can hold it or cuddle with it, soft enough that it feels warm and cuddly, and has a very friendly look. So far, after a month of daily use, it has proven to be durable. We use it every day; I'm glad I bought it."
1,Yuppies can be trashy too!,"This book made me sick, and I don't know how I finished it. I cannot believe this woman wasted her time writing a book about her obviously spoiled daughter. There was no excuse for this girl's behavior, and maybe if her mother had set standards when she was twelve or thirteen, rather than wallowing in her own self - pity, none of this would have ever happened.Living in a slummy neighborhood surrounded by poverty and crime, it disgusts me to see such a privilaged girl living in Marin County, the wealthiest county in the United States, thinking she was so persecuted, when in fact she lives better than most children in the United States. Oh boo hoo, her mother was divorced, but so are about half the households in the United States, and I don't see my friends and classmates acting like slovenly whores, cutting classes, and participating in drinking and drug use."
2,Where is the Mom in this girls life?,"A daugther spirals out of control. Yet mom is busy with her new husband (what a gem he is), shuts her daughter out of her home office and generally puts her head in the sand--thinking that simply worrying about her daughter means she is being a mother. A mother stands up and tries to do what is right-takes action and does something.It is very annoying to read how this mother excuses her own (and her daughters behavior) without EVER learning a thing. Whatever Morgan does, mom grounds her, sends her packing to another relative-does everything but mothers this girl. I would be VERY interested in a book by Morgan--""How I pulled myself out of a terrible time in spite of my mother"""
2,"Bad acting, softcore sex, good story.","Inner Sanctum is about suspicion, jealousy, adultery, and murder. A woman suspects her husband of adultery and attempts suicide. She becomes a hypochondriac invalid, and as her husband reluctantly cares for her, he continues to cheat with his secretary, leading his wife to suspect a murder plot. He hires a nurse who was previously cleared of murdering her own husband to take care of her.The acting is pretty bad for a ""mainstream"" movie, making it seem like an excuse for the excessive nudity and R-rated sex scenes, but the plot thickens and it's interesting to see if the wife's suspicions will bear out, and who is really trying to kill her. Not for children."
5,"Well made, nicely designed","I have two of these and love them, but I'm a big baggallini fan. I have several of their purses.I have not experienced the quality issues the other reviewer mentioned. My cases are sturdy, very lightweight, with ample padding to protect my laptop, and plenty of room for the extras that seem to migrate into my bag.One of the nicest things about baggallini bags is the contrasting lining.Very nice product."
3,Not nearly as nice as the picture,"Let me start by saying, I bought this for $19.99 on a Friday Sale. For $20 it is a decent bag, for $80-90... no way! It is made of a slick polyester-like material, the foam lining can be seen along the seams inside, there are loose threads throughout (easily trimmed away), and the shoulder strap padding cannot be adjusted properly (it does not slide over the buckle to fit well).If I had seen this bag in say, TJ Maxx for $20, I still would have walked away (and I am a compulsive shopper). And, therein lies the problem... if something looks like a good deal, I buy it. Unfortunately, the items sold on the internet are not always what you imagine they will be, and you are unable to ""try it out"" before buying. If it didn't cost me half the price of the bag to return it, I would have."
4,Glimpse of an era,This is a great compilation of the underground club songs you would have known a few years back and should know now!!
1,"Good DVD , bad movie","the DVD was in good shape but the movie was really bad: bad argument, bad cinematography, pretty bat sonography and even worst photography."
3,"works, but doesn't seem to be right.","I bought this battery and charged it per the instructions (3 full cycles), but when I turn on the laptop, after the battery has been fully charged, the battery light flashes amber and I have to push the ON button again to get it to start. In addition to this, the laptop won't play a DVD now on battery alone, but will function correctly when plugged into the power supply (the screen brightens noticeably once I plug it in). The conclusion I've come to is that perhaps this unit has a cell with low voltage. Otherwise, it does run for several hours when fully charged."
3,"Delicious Taste, Sinful Price","These little candies truly are delicious. The flavor is great, and the meltaway texture is sublime. They really do pack a lot of satisfying flavor, and can help a disciplined person pass up a high calorie dessert.So why only 3 stars?Because they charge $3.50 for a small cardboard box with 36 little pieces of candy in it. The box is about the size of a pack of cigarettes. Each ""dessert"" consists of three wafers the size of a penny. The candies truly are tasty, and they do help banish cravings, but $1 or $2 would be a more fair price."
1,Not received the item as promised by Sep30th 2011,"I have not recieved ""Zen Meditation Balls (Miniature Editions)"" as promised by 30th Sep 2011. There is no tracking information. What are my available options ?"
1,"to me, it's not a ""book""","I ordered this more so for the book than the miniature balls, so I was disappointed to find out the ""book"" is a miniature too. It fits in the palm of your hand, so as you can imagine, you can read the whole ""88 pages"" in about five minutes. I don't think that was made clear and am returning mine. However, that being said, it is an attractively put-together set and perfect for someone who didn't want a deeper study. I am leaving this here as an FYI for the next person...."
4,"choking hazard, lol!","these things are tiny, so much so that they are move novelty than anything. I would recommend getting the larger ones from like baoding balls website."
3,Great food but particularly time-consuming,"I have yet to make a bad or even boring dish from this cookbook. That said, I haven't made too many because: a) I want to eat the delicious thing I had once before again but also b)many of the dishes are very complicated and I'm not convinced they need to be.Also, if you don't live in a particularly diverse area, you're going to have to order ingredients online because there aren't substitutions listed. Apparently, it's go ""authentic"" or go home."
1,faulty bottom bracket bearings,"the second time i rode the bike, there was a loud pop and i did not have the ability to pedal or brake. there was a subsequent two week process of trying to get the replacement part from the manufacturer that ended with me returning to the vendor i originally purchased it from."
3,Good Socks but Expensive,"They are pretty good socks but you pay for every thread in them. I bought a pair 3 months ago for $10 here. So, I am going to wait until the price goes down again. Amazon will drop them when they aren't selling. Evidently they have the price fixed because every site that sell them has the exact same price.I only started buying better than Walmart cheepo's because of diabetes and foot pain. I wasted $15 on a pair of Thorlo Thick Cushion Tennis Crew Sock and they are horrible. They ball up hard as a rock after washing.These socks are comfortable and soft."
5,A superb & outstanding book about real people and ghosts,A superb book that'll make you think twice aboutthe ongoing debate of the existance of otherdimensions and beyond death.
5,The Definitive Quiz,This book changed my life. I had been living with my boyfriend for years and feeling very unsure when I read this thought provoking book. The Shacking Up Chemistry Quiz on page 47 cut through the confusion and illuminated my situation. I knew I needed to move on as soon as I took the quiz. I only wish I had read this book earlier. I highly recommend this read for anyone who feels unsure about their live-in or potential live-in. Thank God for Stacy and Wynne! Without their book I might still be stuck in uncertainty.
5,GREAT BOOK...A Must Read!!,"I bought this book after having the ""talk"" with my boyfriend of moving in together. I had always been the one wanting to move in and he was dragging his feet, but once we decided to start looking for a house I started to freak (not so sure anymore).This book was so helpful to put things into perspective. Not only does this book give great advice and recommendations for couples thinking of moving in together....but it also gives such great relationship advice. From how to communicate, how to live together, how to work through problems...etc.I think all young women should read this book before shaking up! It will give you great insight."
5,Shacking Up thanks,"I read the book on a New York / Phoenix business round trip. I am 26, and about to take the plunge with my boyfriend of ten months, the book was totally helpful. My biggest obstacles regarding this HUGE!!! decision, like telling my parents, were all really well addressed. The issues I've faced, or completely stressed about, in thinking about my upcoming move, were pretty well covered in the book. If moving in with a boyfriend is as big of a deal to others, as it has totally been for me, then I would definately suggest the book. It covered all my issues, and gave me a good guideline to be successful in what's been an exciting, and challenging decision. The book really helped me identify with a lot of the emotions I've been having, and has quickly helped me feel more confident about my decisions."
5,"Funny, Informative, and Useful!!","Stacy and Wynne Whitman have put together a book that combines humerous anecdotes with very useful and much needed information. It is about time someone addressed this difficult yet common situation! The book used the real experiences of people to help unravel the obvious and not so obvious problems associated with living together. I highly recommend it for anyone thinking about living together, currently living together, or couples who have already lived through the process!"
2,repetitive,"If you are in love with your man, skip the first hundred pages, which simply asks the reader: Are you sure you want to be with him? Assuming the answer is yes, you can move on to the actual shacking up part. This has some good info, but is drawn out for far too long. You can pick this book up in the store and skim the few useful chapters to get the main ideas. I gave up reading this book towards the end. I also read Unmarried to Each Other, which I enjoyed. Check out that book instead."
1,Puh-leeze!,"I agree with the previous reviewer, this book focuses only on women who are looking to get married and settle down. It does not offer good advice if you are merely interested in sharing a place with your man to live closer and cut expenses. I read the book and regretted it because it made me doubt my decision. In the end, no one knows your relationship better than you so always go with your gut because no book is going to know any better!!"
3,Good Discussion Guide,"I don't think I fit the target market for Shacking Up. Shacking up is aimed toward women and assumes too much and relies too heavily on male and female stereotypes. It is too quick to assume the shackers don't have any problem with it and to quick to assume the shackers' parents do. It's also a 100 miles wide and 1 inch deep.That being said, Shacking Up is a great resource for any couple either considering moving in together or who has recently moved in together. It may be geared toward women, but the issues it looks like are the same for both parties. Shacking Up can be valuable just as a discussion guide. It's also written in a chatty and easily readable style.Shacking Up gives important financial and legal information, but it's not entirely accurate. For example, Shacking Up states that common law marriage takes a long time, but in at least one state--Texas--common law marriage has no time requirement. Readers would be better served with a chart."
2,"Not What I Expected, Pick a Different Option","Eh. The book was written in a fairly chatty, irritating tone, instead of the intelligent tone one might expect. Most of the book is about the emotional aspects of living together, and does not present much actual information. I suggest buying one or both of these books instead:Unmarried to Each Other: The Essential Guide to Living Together as an Unmarried CoupleLiving Together: A Legal Guide for Unmarried CouplesI found both of these to be excellent and informative guides, and much more mature in tone and approach."
2,"This book is, like, only for the truly, like, confused","Personally, I threw this down at page 34: ""If we weren't willing to take any chances whatsoever, we'd probably still be living with our parents, working at our local libraries, and hiding our hard-earned money under our mattresses.""The tagline may be ""The Smart Girl's Guide..."" but this book seems to have been written for morons. I agree with the other negative reviews - it's extremely basic, and assumes the man is not wholeheartedly committed and that the couple is just rushing into this uninformed and fly-by-night. If you are actually a smart girl, read a different book, don't bother being patronized by these babbling bimbos.And working in a local public library IS not a risk-free, easy-as-pie to make a living."
5,INFORMATIVE AND INSIGHTFUL,"Any woman needs to read this book before ""shacking up."" I was thinking of moving in with my boyfriend and after reading the book I realize that I have alot more thinking to do. There are many issues to resolve before taking that step especially the fact that he won't discuss the ""M"" word with me! I thought living together was a step towards marriage but after reading the book I realize that it could be a step in the opposite direction. Thanks to the book, I may have saved myself some major heartache."
5,Food for thought,"As someone who is struggling to decide whether to ""shack up"", I I found this book helpful and informative. I especially liked the stuff about how to tell your parents. I know my mom and dad will have a heartattack (!), so it's good to know how to approach the conversation. The book has actually made me feel more ready to ""take the plunge,"" because I can be sure that I've thought through all the issues. The chapters are a little long...but the book is comprehensive...and you can skip around to find the info that applies to you."
2,"Heterosexist, narrow-minded","I did not find this book helpful or worth my time. It's light-hearted and easy to read, but at the expense of being incredibly shallow. It focuses exclusively on hetero couples who are headed to the altar, with no allowance for other lifestyles or choices. Particularly shocking was inclusion of different religious views and children as a ""deal breakers.""For a thoughful, comprehensive consideration of this topic, head to ""Unmarried to each other."""
1,Ridiculous book,"This book is like a Cosmo article. This is not surprising beacuse it's written by a person who writes for women's mags like cosmo. I really think its a horrible resource. Its overwhelming message is that to live together who have to be seriously considering life-long committment. It completely ignores those of us who simply want to share our lives with someone. I found it to be very poorly done and actually scared me about moving in with my mate. A much better book I would like to recommend is _Unmarried to eachother_ by Solot and Miller also offered here at Amazon. It is a good resource which discusses all kinds of reasons that people decide not to get married and includes all kinds of different relationships. It discusses financial and legal issues. It is a book that made me feel more confident about my ability to make this important change in my life, that the risk might be worth it.Leave Shacking up on the Amazon shelf."
1,"Better than I expected (Oops, 5 star, not 1)","It is a pleasant surprise when a product works better than expected. I am using the keyboard with a Zire 72. I actually find the keyboard to have a better feel than that on my laptop, and it is a whole lot easier to lug around. I decided to get an infrared instead of a bluetooth because I had read they have better battery life (not to mention being more than $100 less in cost). I have yet to replace the batteries in the keyboard, and it seems very easy on battery life on the Palm itself."
1,"Need help - Palm wireless keyboard is Locked, frozen tight","The keyboard is locked. Checked everything -- all in good order. The keys are locked up tight and no one i know has been able to figure out how to unlock it. It been extraordinarily frustrating on this trip as I have docs and info on it that I need for my busn travels, meetings. Does anyone know how the #%*+# keyboard can be unlocked???? Thanks to anyone who may respond."
5,The quintessential Rock 'n' Roll movie of all time.,"I can't say much that hasn't already been said here. Michael Pare is phenomenal as Joe West/Eddie Wilson, a musician trying to come to grips with both his past and the troubles it has caused for him in the present. The soundtrack is the best I've ever heard for ANY movie. I especially love how throughout the movie Joe West/Eddie Wilson acts as a tutor of sorts for a speed-metal playing, self-flattering guitarist. He bestows gems of wisdom like ""Music's gotta live; it's gotta breathe."" A true modern-day classic movie. If Amazon can help get this movie on DVD it would be great. I count myself lucky to own an original VHS tape, but having this movie on DVD would be nice."
5,LittleFoot,I recommend this selle. My item was in great condition and was mailed to me quickly! I would purchase from you again. Thank you!
5,Eddie and the Crusiers 2 Eddie Lives,I remember the first time I saw it on TV I thought it was a great company for the first one.I wish TCM or AMC would have these on a bit more.I do not think they have been given a fare shake.The story lines and actors are really good!!
5,Eddie and the Cruiser: Eddie Lives,"I have had the first one for many years, but could never find part 2. I was thrilled when I found the second part. The movie showed up in excellent condition and I was very happy."
3,not a bad movie,I thought the first movie was alot better it was ok but not what i thought it was going to be like in the first.
5,Unbeleivably Great !,"I saw this movie years ago in my youth and it was unforgetable. I felt transformed by the music and now watching it again. Its like stepping thru a window in time, its a magical fountain of youth and eveytime I watch it I am transformed ,renewed, I am young and energetic, I feel alive !"
1,Eddie and the Snoozers,"I don't know who they are paying to leave these reviews but this movie is terrible. As a musicians I immediately identified with the first installment of Eddie and The Cruisers and it's characters, but outside of the shell's of men in Eddie and Sal this movie seems like a straight to VHS masterpeice in terms of substance. Not only is the dialogue and storyline terrible but it's take on 80's Pop and Metal musicians suddenly mastering the fusion of gritty soul and rock 'n roll in the matter of a couple of jam sessions completes this blunder of a film.Eddie would have been better off dead."
3,Bring it out on DVD,I totally agree with all the writers who want this brought out on DVD. I have the original Eddie and would love to have this on DVD. VHS is old school. DVD is the new way to go.
5,A Classic Rock and Roll Movie,"Eddie and the Cruisers and this sequel are an example of Great Classic Rock and Roll Movies. Excellent Music, Plots and Performances are sure to make these cult favorites for years to come. The sound track is available, and is also excellent! I hope Eddie Lives!!! becomes available on DVD."
4,Really good,Never heard of Eddie and The Cruisers until a fb friend mentioned it on fb. I was looking for the original and came upon this and decided to give it a try. I liked it a lot and would love to see the original.
4,Eat your heart out!,I love this movie! I have it on Laser Disc (p/s) and will not part with it. I am also waiting for the DVD.
4,GOOD ENTERTAINMENT WITH A DECENT PLOT,I WAS COMPLETELY CONVINCED THAT MICHAEL PARE' WAS SINGING AND PLAYING THE GUITAR. HE WAS PERFECT FOR THIS CHARACTER IN BOTH MOVIES.
4,Barren Book,"This is one of the view novels Georgette Heyer (her own sternest critic) suppressed. If youre expecting one of the lighthearted, feel-good romances Georgette Heyer usually writes, prepare yourself for a shock. The title is aptly chosen and rather gives it away: this book is barren, lacking warmth. Dont get me wrong, it is very well written and you find no difficulty in falling in love with the heroin, crying when she cries,but unable to laugh for the simple reason that there is nothing to laugh at. The story is devoid of even a light sprinkle of wit or irony, leaving it rather stark and chilling. Heyer also fails to provide us with her usual charming hero, which could have been a saving grace. A good book, well worth reading, but if this is your first Heyer novel it might be wise to start with another titel, as this will give you quite a wrong immpression of the rest of Heyers incomparable works."
5,World religions,The book Came quickly in the mail and arrived exactly as advertised. No problems here and highly recommend this to others
4,its good interesting,i bought this book for a religion class and i'm finding it quite interesting one thing i really like about it is it is NOT biased it doesnt INSULT any religions.
1,"HORRIBLE transcode, VHS has better quality!","I suppose if you're a diehard fan of this movie, you can sit through the grid pattern that shows up throughout 80% of the movie but if you're getting this because you're looking for DVD quality, you're not going to find it here. Sad given that this is a decent thriller from the 80's."
2,Dull movie,"This movie was not at all as I had expected. It was supposed to be scary but I found that I was not at all scared. I mean I was grossed out at the fact that the madman was putting everyone in heck with slaughtering them, but that's about it.Nothing in the movie was scary, really. The only reason I gave this movie a 2 was because it could pass as another genre, but it was supposed to horror. It could have been an action movie but they made it sound like a horror movie.The special effects were good but the acting slowed it down. The lame Texas accents were as I said lame and [bad].Trust me, rent Joy Ride or Jeepers Creepers. You might enjoy it a bit, but it is slow and not worth the wait.Thanks."
2,NOT A HORROR MOVIE,"If you think this is a horror movie you are VERY wrong. So did I... This movie has almost NOTHING to do with hitchhiking. This is more of a cop chasing killer movie. Its not scary and I stress that. I bought this movie and now I deeply regret it. Its okay for a thriller maybe but this movie is not very good and hardly scary. Its just like ""The Chase"" only a thriller. NOT A HORROR MOVIE! The Hitchhiker isn't even scary..."
4,A great thriller.,"Well executed psychological thriller with nice blend of story and action. One of the great thrillers from the 80's. Rutger Hauer is terrific in this film, on par with his performance in Blade Runner. This film effectively deals with the issue of fear, how it haunts a person, how it consumes, and how that person becomes one."
5,One of the best thrillers ever.,"This movie is amazing. I've seen it so many times and each time I pick up on something new in the movie. A great thriller, great cast and I can't imagine the new remake can come anywhere close to the original. Rutger Hauer is truly so scary and psychotic. You won't be disappointed."
4,The roads weren't safe back in the eighties,"There can be something almost magical over 80:ies movies. ""Terminator"" has it. Especially the ending with the desert road and synthersizer music. The same kind of magic is present in ""The Hitcher"".A young man is almost falling asleep on the road, early in the morning. He stops to take up a hitchhiker. From there on event follow upon event with nightmarish logic. Literally. (Maybe it all is a nightmare?) Great acting by the main characters. Actually very good acting throughout the film. And Hauer is cold as ice as the hitcher/madman.The fine synthetic music and beautiful nature pictures sets the mood. Add some action, and good dialogue scenes. This horror/action/thriller is not for all tastes, but it is very well done."
5,Rutger Hauer can do it all,"This movie is a tell-tale sign of Rutger Hauer's acting abilities. At this time he was making a killing in the movie, he was giving us a mysterious character which we know nothing about. Even so, the viewer is scared of him. This movie made people quit picking up Hitchhikers, because this could really happen. It even spawned a TV series named after it and a ton of other Hitcher style movies. If you haven't seen it, watch it before you see the remake, this one blows the new one out of the water."
4,Does anyone hate this?,"Everyone who has watched this loves it. Need I say more? It's just one of those cult psycho thrillers that goes off.There's another DVD which I am hoping to find (anyone heard of it?)called ""Back for revenge"" starring C Thomas Howell in a reversal role. He is the avenger and some of the murder scenes are just great."
5,Very Well made horror thriller,This film is not really about much at all. You will not emerge from the cinema a better or more intelligent person. It is however an effective well crafted horror thriller.A young man is driving a car across America. He picks up a hitcher who is clearly a psycopathic killer and is perhaps something more. He is able to escape but as he travells across America he is followed by the killer.The role of the killer is played by Rutger Hauer. He is brilliant in the role and is able to convery a sense of both menance and evil.The film is not one that has many scenes which are gross outs or filled with horror yet the film has an absolute tension which goes from scene to scene. It is a consumately brilliant film from a technical point of view.
2,"Gripping...yet really, really long","Hitcher takes a great story and turns it into an unbelievable, frustrating mess. Murphy's Law is definitely the premise of this movie. It becomes so frustrating watching everything go wrong. The problem with the movie is one that is just so unbelievable. I have this problem with a lot of movies but this one just takes it so far that it totally ruins it for me. The killer manages to be everywhere with little explanation of how he got there. Not only that, but he seems to be able to move and kill silently without anyone noticing until an opportune moment when he suddenly appears. The only good thing about this movie is Rutger Hauer who plays his part perfectly. And it is occasionally suspenseful when you're not too busy laughing at it."
2,Dull movie,"This movie was not at all as I had expected. It was supposed to be scary but I found that I was not at all scared. I mean I was grossed out at the fact that the madman was putting everyone in heck with slaughtering them, but that's about it.Nothing in the movie was scary, really. The only reason I gave this movie a 2 was because it could pass as another genre, but it was supposed to horror. It could have been an action movie but they made it sound like a horror movie.The special effects were good but the acting slowed it down...... You might enjoy it a bit, but it is slow and not worth the wait.Thanks."
1,Movie would not play,"Thid movie refused to play. I think the copy is very old or defective. I'm a C. Thomas Howell fan, but I don't know if I liked this movie."
2,There is nothing wrong with your television set....,"The two-star review is for the transfer. While the movie itself is pretty good, the transfer for this DVD is awful. It looks like they burned copies from an old VHS tape (that happened to be in widescreen) and turned around and sold it to the public for consumption. Sorry I bought it."
2,Stop watching after 20 minutes,"The first 20 or 30 minutes of The Hitcher are really well done and genuinely frightening. After that it breaks down into a film of strung-together, ludicrous plot devices and nothing more. The film does nothing but turn your stomach for the remainder. Many people enjoy it, but I'd see it first before purchasing it."
3,The Hitcher-stupid film!,"man, what a dissapointment! I thought the idea behind this movie was great so I cheacked it out(its good Amazon rating also influenced me to see it).Maybe I went into the movie expecting something else, because I didn't get the intelligent fun thriller I was expecting. This movie is more like a B horror film, rather then a realistic thrill ride. Rutger Haurer did a wonderful acting job, but the guy is more like Micheal Myers then a real pyschotic hitcher. Rutger shows up like a genie at every turn and he is almost invincible.acting=4 starsFX=NAending=3.5 starsatmosphere=3 starsEditing&Directing;=2 starstoryline=2 starsmeaningfullness=NAOVERALL-2.9 starsA really weak unrealistic movie that must have been a favorite on USA up all night. I think people who praise this movie, like it more for nostolgic reasons, then if its good or bad..."
2,To Anyone Who Rates This Movie With More Than 2 Stars: Huh?,"I want to know what movie they were watching, beacuse this is not that great a film. Some suspense, a lot of bad acting, and way too many scenes when you say out loud ""OH, come on"", like falling out of a moving car at 60 MPH and then getting up without a scratch. This movie, it's just OKAY. RENT IT!"
4,A Good Horror/Thriller,"The Hitcher starts off promising, although exactly as you'd expect it would based on the title and the cover. It's a rainy night on a highway in the middle of a desert. Our main character falls asleep for a few moments at the wheel of his car, and almost crashes into the front of a tractor-trailer. Realizing he needs something other than the radio to help keep him awake he picks up a hitchhiker on the side of the road. The hitcher doesn't say much at first, but as they pass a broken down car the hitcher is quick to admit that he killed its driver by cutting off all of his limbs. Then he pulls out a knife, but our hero manages to narrowly escape.The rest of the movie follows our hero as he gets set-up by the hitcher and wanted by the police for murders that he didn't commit. And naturally it all ends with a showdown between him and the hitcher.A good thriller but it gets rather boring in the middle with the exception of a good car chase or two."
3,Remember What Ur Mom Said About Hitchhiker's,"This film is nothing your mother hasn't already told you about the danger's of hitchhiking. It's a film I guess you sould see especially nowadays, but it isn't one that's an all out blockbuster. I was disappointed that there wasn't more to the story, but the ending was classic. To me this is a film you can see once, it is far from a true classic. I will say this about the movie; it's a learning experience for those who are careless about who they haul around in their vehicles.-Kris L. CocKayne-"
4,"""Good 80's Thriller!""","Rutger Hauer and C. Thomas Howell star in this 1986 thriller.A teen becomes part of a killer's deadly game after givinghim a ride. Rutger is a good villain and this dvd has decentpicture and sound, but only the trailer. I recommend thisgood 80's thriller."
2,"Great movie, horrible DVD","The reason I bought a DVD player almost four years ago was that I finally saw for myself the drastic increase in picture quality from VHS. I can tolerate DVD releases that skimp on extras like behind the scenes documentaries and director commentary, but I do demand good picture quality. This DVD fails to deliver. It doesn't look too bad when the scenes occur in daylight, but when you reach the point in the story where darkness falls and the scenes were shot at night, the extremely low quality of the film print and digital transfer come shining through. I haven't seen this much grain and artifacting since... well, ever. It's even worse than the ""gray market"" DVD of the Twin Peaks pilot episode. Buy if you must, but as for me I wish I'd held out for a better edition."
3,An entertaining horror/ thriller!,I class this film as a horror simply because it is a relativly scary feature. Imagine picking up a hitch hiker only to realise he is a psychotic maniac! A good film!
5,One of the truly scariest horror flicks out there,"Great horror film, incredible acting, great killer and more suspence than most can handle. Great direction and executed to perfection. THIS IS A HORROR FILM!!! DON'T PICK UP HITCHHIKERS!"
4,Truly an original,"There was no need to make a remake. This movie is compelling, thrilling, chilling and will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat.I remember the first time I saw it at the age of 21--My chest was tight, my heart was pounding, and I never picked up a hitchhiker again.You must add this to your collection of thrillers.Good cast, and convincing acting.This is truly an original!Stephen John BecciaAuthor of The Treelanders"
4,South Texas Romance at its best!,"In Blue Plate Special, Cheri Jetton has blended a mix of down home truckstop wisdom, true southern values, and cattle ranching family wholesomeness into a compelling story about two hearts finding a home. Megan Stallings, running from scandal and her bad judgement of married men and their intentions, breaks down on the highway to Houston. Chad Winslow, Huntsville native, rancher and son of a truckstop owning family, plays knight in shining armor. It doesn't take long before he realizes that Meg is really in trouble and needs more than just car repairs.This riveting story about two stubborn people overcoming their own hurts to plan for a future together is a delight to read. Curl up and enjoy this heartwarming story again and again. Guaranteed to become one of your favorite ""keepers""--I know it will be one of mine!Avalon has proven that it knows great new writing talent. I will look for Cheri Jetton's next book with great pleasure."
3,average sheets,"These sheets are just about average... they are very thin and light weight and for 1000 thread count, I thought not very well constructed. I could have spent half the money and got a set of sheets just as comfortable. Nice sheets, but not worth the amount they cost"
5,for crafts and repairs,It was exactly what I wanted to bind the edges of a completed needlepoint. I also use this type of tape to make clothing repairs for grandchildren. I would recommend it to anyone for similar purposes.
5,"All-in-all, it's great",Love this product - much more pleasant smell than Febreeze and seems to freshen better. I highly recommend this fabric refresher - especially if you have a house full of teenage boys!
2,Kenwood KDC-232MR Marine CD Receiver,"I am a bit unhappy with this unit. It arrived in good time, but took me a while to install. It is being installed in a hot tub. The Radio plays excellent , but the CD gets a TOC error on every CD and will not play any CD. Granted it is a refurbished unit, but it is supposed to work as it was checked out buy Kenwood. It took long enought to install it that it is past the return time for amazon. I will have to return it to Kenwood now for repair. I had to have a marine radio for this application and they are tough to find. Don't think I will buy refurbished again.Buyer Beware.That's my review ....BS"
5,the Montgomery Clift conundrum,It's AT's world. We're just living in it. Cath them live with his full band. There's nothing else like it at the moment.
2,Good but needs more meat on the bones - call the doctor!,"This book was geared toward a high school student,someone with minimal experience in the work force, or someone who does not have access to computer websites. Interviewing, forms, college costs, were briefly commented on.If you are looking for specific nursing classifications and job descriptions and titles, career paths, this book does not provide any good data."
1,Book,"Never got the book!! WIll not use Amazon again!!!!If this is how Amazon works, it sucks... Should have gotten a follow up e-mail to make sure items were recieved"
5,Helpful,This book is great for people that have a difficult time understanding Shakespeare. The side notes are more elaborate than most of the other editions and they include an act by act summary so that you know exactly what's going on and don't get lost in all the wording.
2,It's awful!,I read this book this last year in highschool for English class. It was awful! First of all it's really confusing and second of all it's just a stupid plot and ending. It was so boring and so long. Don't read it it's a waste of time.
4,Excellent copy of Othello,"I've been using the Folger library series for years now, and although the Norton Critical edition has its place, the Folger edition cannot be beat for clarity and accessibility. Pay the extra couple of bucks for the 5.5 x 8paperback rather than the smaller mass market paperback. The paper quality and illustrations are far superior in the larger version."
5,This is an easier way to read Shakespeare.,"The Folger editions have the notes on the right page and the text on the left. The summary at the begining makes looking for quotes easier too. The book got to me on time through the storm, the seller was great."
3,a bridge fro mm quantum mechanics to semiconductor electroni,"The book is a good introduction to semiconductor electronics. Starting from the basic principles of quantum mechanics, the reader is introduced to some well known problems (potential bariers, wells, etc.). The cristal structures and the motion of electrons in lattices are then presented. The theory of the transport (drift and diffusion of electrons and holes) concludes the statistical mechanics part. Starting from the band models the operation of semiconductor devices (diodes and transistors) is finally presented. The book is a general introduction, but lacks some details and some proofs that would be appropriate for an undergraduate senior class. There are some important typos. A software package is also included. The book is a little overpriced."
1,It's an imitation,"I thought I was buying Eau de Parfum, not an imitation of Obsession. I'm very disappointed that it was not disclosed as such."
4,"Rubber Ducky, You're The One !!","Obsession.... by Calvin Klein. This is my wife's favorite fragrance, and I usually purchase it for her around Christmas. I shopped around, and Amazon had the best price by far. Shipping usually only takes a couple of days, regardless of the shipping method I use. Save your time and money, just buy from Amazon !!"
3,Too Strong,"I bought this perfume, good packaging, good quality, but personally, I did not like the smell, it was too strong and was more like a male fragrance than a woman's. I have used other CK fragrances, and they were nice, this one wasn't. some people may like it but I felt it was too strong and masculine, but it depends on what individual preferences are."
2,Obsession or Secret Obsession,"In looking at the bottle and description you would think this was Obsession. What I received was considerably different. The bottle is not shaped anything like the one picture here. It is not a round/oval shape it is more of a star shape and is entitled ""Secret Obsession"". This is not the same thing. It has a different, not unpleasant, fragrance. I advise caution to ensure you get what you are expecting. As this was a gift it was not returned."
1,Sprayer,This product is missing the sprayer. Can't return since it's a flammable liquid. This product would ship non regulated by DOT due to it's size exemption so the return policy is a sham as well. Customer just ends up $28.00 ripped off.
5,Always a hit.,"This my wife's signature scent, so I know I can't go wrong wrapping this for Christmas. One of our granddaughters said to her ""Grandmom you always smell so good."" She often get compliments from friends and coworkers as well. I like giving her something that I know in advance she will love."
2,Seams old ...,"When I first sprayed it ,I was sure it was the original obession as I was worried about fake perfumes however, after like 15 minutes of spraying this the scent that remained was not at all fresh smelling but rather like an old perfume that has been lying in my closet for ages .. won't buy again.."
1,Not Genuine?,"This bottle of Obsession does not smell correct. It has none of the vanilla essence that made it so appealing. It smells more like a men's musk cologne. I don't know if it is a fake or if the formula has been altered, but it is definitely NOT the same as the Obsession Eau De Parfum that I have been using for the last 6 years. Buyer beware!"
5,Great Scent.....,"I always wear Obsession at least for the last 20+ years.I thought it was a larger bottle, I can get a better price locally, and not pay postage!"
1,Smells like old men,Not a very feminine smell. Smells like men cologne. Would never ever wear! Horrible product!!!! Guess I will throw away since can't return!
2,Buyer Beware,"Beware of ordering fragrances from Amazon. I love Obsession and have worn it for years. This bottle smells like it is old...it has an alchohol-like distorted scent...not like the Osbession I am accustomed to. I cannot return it to Amazon because of federal regulations which prohibit regular citizens from packing and shipping fammable liquids. So I am basically out $35.00. From now on, I will buy all fragrances in store."
1,Fake Obsession Sold By Amazon LLC!,"I have worn Obsession for years and although this item was wrap as though it were new, I opened it and sprayed to test and it does NOT smell like the current bottle I am almost out of. I will talk to my credit card company about this!"
3,Spicy & Strong,"Not too crazy about it;the scent is okay. I like the shape of the bottle, but its Probably my least favorite of the Calvin Klein Line. Three words....Spicy, woodsy and very strong."
3,fake,"this isn't the real Obsession. it is a knock off and should be labled as such. It really doesn't do much for me but my boyfriend likes it. Regardless, they need to mention you aren't getting what you think you are buying. It is a very large bottle though."
5,obsessed by obsession!,"I have worn Obsession for years and it never fails that someone will comment on good it smells, how good I smell. It is a great identifying perfume if it fits with your body chemistry. I absolutely love it and it is well worth every penny of the purchase price!"
5,kvepalusala,This is one of my all-time favorite scents! This perfume isn't comparible to anything - finally a totally unique scent!
2,parfum,Well I bought this for my girl . I had sampled the men's and thought it had a great scent so I assumed the women's would as well. The women's has more of a powdery smell not to my liking. I prefer a vibrant deep scent not sweet that makes you remember the lady who is wearing it!So beware I'd advise you to go and check out the scent before you buy!The shipping process was great.
3,Obsession,"I bought this product as a Christmas gift thinking that I had smelled it once before, I was wrong! Usually anything ""Calvin Klein"" is pretty good, but I was not impressed by the smell of this perfume. I did like the price however! I would recommend this product for someone over the age of say 45. It is more of a fitting scent for a mature lady."
3,Comment on Feb. review,"The previous reviewer lists three psychiatrists/neuroscientists, Daniel Schacter, Joseph Ledoux, and Richard McNally, that are very important to trauma studies; however, his or her claim that Caruth ""ignored"" the work of these scientists is misleading and unfair.Her book was published in 1996, while the majority of these men's work on trauma appeared in the late 1990s and the 2000s. Schacter, who has been publishing longer that the other two, did have a book published in 1994 on memory. However, ""trauma"" does not even appear in the index. While the work of pschyiatrists and neuroscientists can illuminate other, more literarially-minded trauma theorists today, most of these sources were not available to Caruth."
2,"Hello, Mary Sue","If you see this novel's herione, Sola Thane, as a high end ""Mary Sue"", this novel makes a lot more sense. That doesn't make it a very good novel but does give it a sort of consistency. And hey, it's better than ""The Vulcan Academy Murders."""
1,wow..abysmal,"once again another cool premise proposed by the co authors which fails miserably...love..between kirk, sola thane...and..spock?!?!? that love triangle makes a very interesting premise for a star trek adventure only to be ruined by poor writing and a convoluted parallel plot...as with the prometheus design, the authors dwell on metaphysical 'villains' (for lack of a better word), who's motivations aren't very clear...in addition, when reading books by these authors I feel like I'm comming into a movie 20 minutes late..as if there were three or so chapters missing from the book...no character backgrounds, no exposition..just thrown violently into a story that they feel you SHOULD know what they're talking about..bad..just bad..."
5,One of the best Star Trek novels,"This is a prime Star Trek novel. Easily one of the best. The plot is direct and easy to follow as in all ST novels. But, where most others are thin on character development ""Triangle"" makes the characters rich and real and believable. In fact, I can't think of one Star Trek novel where the authors did a better job of creating emotion than Marshak and Culbreath do in ""Triangle.""What's more surprising is that this is one of the shortest ST novels. I read these mainly because they are fast easy reads, they're purely entertainment for me. I therefore let them evaporate from my memory. I've read almost 50 of them and this is one of few that has stuck in my head, even though I read it in the late 80's."
1,Can't finish it,"I have an OCD involving novels, that no matter how bad, I will carve my way through it like a scout in the Amazon, machete in hand. But in this novel, for perhaps only the second time in my life, I packed up my gear and headed home. It's so dreadfully written that I can't read more than two pages before putting it down again, wondering why, oh why, did this bad writing get past editing. This makes even Larry Niven's characters believable, and makes me reconsider how bad I thought Dayton Ward's Vanguard novels were. In contrast, those were quite good compared to this Star Trek novel. Granted, it's been 28 years since it was published so this review is not exactly useful when the book can be had for a couple bucks, but only a die-hard collector of these novels will acquire Triangle for their collection, and then only for the collection, not for reading."
1,One of the worst Star Trek novels,"I used to read Star Trek novels regularly, and this one stands out in my mind as the worst one I read. Sometimes I would have to read a novel for a while before I understood the plot -- but I never got this one at all. I got half-way through ""Triangle"" and still had not even the slightest clue what was going on -- it seemed to be mostly a lot of talk about people having various visions and hallucinations and whatnot. I finally gave up and tossed the book aside, not having even the remotest clue of what it was all about."
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased this stroller after hearing from people and reading reviews about how great Combi's products are. At first I liked it, but there is no room for storage underneath and the wheels are constantly getting stuck to where I cannot push the stroller. Plus I am taller than most women and it is nearly impossible to push this stroller comfortably without kicking the wheels. I can't imagine how it would be for men to push it. It is made with very cheap materials...I am already looking for a new stroller after only having it for a few months."
1,Am I missing something??,"This is the worst stroller ever, I bought this one on a whim because I forgot my stroller at home and this one was on clearance and I really liked how it folded up and then folded again into a really compact stroller...I thought this is perfect a little rickety because it does fold so much, but good, then I actually put my son in it and the basket underneath is a joke, it's more like a drawstring bag and when I put my purse in it, it weighed it down so much that it drug on the wheels and much longer than 1 day & it would've created a hole in the basket. The harness was annoying to unclip and it didn't do much in regards to holding my son in, he did fall asleep but he didn't look all that comfortable and he was able to get under the actual seat which is only attached to the stroller by a few straps, (this apparently makes it possible to remove and wash) but it was annoying that he was able to put things under it! I will be returning this stroller and never buying it again!"
5,Excelente!!!!!!,"It is a very good DVD set. The Pianist, the orchestra and the Director are the best. I prefer the PCM sound, because is lossless."
4,Waiting for success,"I've had this for a few months now, I like the sound it puts out, but it has provided no success in calling in a predator. I'm not giving up on this quite yet. It's very convenient and saves my breath from blowing my call."
2,A mild let-down.,"I read this book in its entirety while queuing for a NIN gig in London. When the line moved up, the book stayed behind.'Going Under' is an amateurish psychological murder mystery with, at best, only a bland 'surprise-ending.' I concede that Wright seems to me an author worth reading in his own 'wright': his prose is both elegant and memorable. Thus, the book comes recommended as a time-killer -- if you've a few hours with nothing better to do -- simply for its distinct and stylish prose, which is clever enough that you will wish the plot was half as good."
2,Customer service is the best thing about this...,"We were pretty excited to get this cabinet at such a good price, but then we realized why it was priced such. The craftsman ship was terrible, the door latches didn't align so the one door with the other when closed. It also took way too long to put together compared to the quality of the finished product. On top of that the shelf spacing was odd in that if you had DVD's on one shelf you couldn't have them on the one directly above or below it (only fit CD's). As the title of the review says, the only good thing about this product was the customer service, they said they will send us a free shipping label so we can return the product. Finally have a vacuum handy when you open this item as the cheap styrofoam it is packed in flakes and gets EVERYWHERE. Product deserves 1 star but will give 2 due to the nice customer support."
4,Great Soundtrack,"The Accompanist is a fabulous soundtrack. It is very much a stand-alone album although watching the film obviously gives it a greater depth and warmth, if that's possible. Laurence Monteyrol's voice is delicious and the section and arrangements are delightful. Strauss, Mozart, Schubert. Grab a glass of red, lie on the couch and enjoy."
2,Disappointing,"I've had this sander for a few years now and it has never been that great. I got it because of a positive review in ""Fine Woodworking"" magazine but the paper flies off whenever I use it and it vibrates terribly. It was sent back to Bosch to have checked out but it just has never performed as promised even after I got it back."
3,Bosch sander,After 16 months the sanding pad disentegrated - Stick with Dewalt. I have an old Dewalt that is still going
4,Garbage Disposer Stopper,"This is not an easy item to find, so when I located it in this site I immediately ordered some. I would recommend these."
1,junk,"I order this heart rate monitor for my forerunner 301. It appeared to be brand new out of the packaging and I am sure it was, however, it does not work. It could be a dead battery, who knows, the bottom line is that it should have worked. Now I have this useless piece of equipment. I would buy a battery for it but I can't because I am in Afghanistan. The CR2032 battery required is not sold out here."
1,im not buying anything from this site anymore..they suck,this is the second one purchased in one month..only got partial credit for last one that was only used once then failed
2,Should have been better,"Room 33 is about a troubled young couple and a roller derby team who get stranded in an abandoned mental hospital where a crazy girl is running around and people are turning up dead sans eyeballs. Good luck figuring out much of anything beyond that. I guess the actual killer is supposed to be the crazy chick's dead father who is living on as one of her multiple personalities and was the head doctor at this place. Why is he dead? Got me. Why is he killing people? No idea. Too bad the script is such a mess, because they had the makings of a decent b-horror flick for the first half. The girls were cute and you start to care about some of them. The acting is poor but not offensive, it was filmed pretty well, but the script and plot holes are what really hurt it. Still, for budget horror you could do a whole lot worse (Secrets of the Clown, dear God)."
2,Not Too Good!!!,"This movie started off okay, then it got weird and confusing. These roller bladers get stuck in the middle of nowhere, and seek refuge at an insane asylum. They meet a crazy girl, and people begin to start dying. I wouldn't recommend ROOM 33!!!"
2,small ball,I guess I didn't read the specs on this one. Really small ball. My one year old boys can't find half the time. Dont think I would buy again.
3,Great toy but TINY,Fun and entertaining toy for a toddler but it is so small! I was expecting something larger based on the photo and this fits into the palm of my (small) hand!
1,Choking Hazard,"I wanted to love this but sadly it went in the trash this past weekend. The product is meant for 12 months and up but Amazon has their own ""choking hazard"" warning stamped on the product page stating the toy is suitable for 3 years and up. I suppose I should have taken more notice. When this toy arrived, I opened the box to find one of the rings had fallen out and one of the little smiley face figures was rolling around at the bottom of the box. I put it back together, thinking it was sturdy and dropped it on the floor several times to see if it would come apart again. It didn't. However, if I tugged a little on it the ring would come out and with it, the smiley figure. So unfortunately, this cute little toy just went in the trash because it really is a choking hazard, per Amazon's warning. I do not recommend buying this toy :("
3,Ok but LOT smaller than picture implys,"This is a nice toy, and my little girl likes it, but this is about the size of a tennis ball. I was thinking it would be a lot larger."
3,Smaller then thought.,"Although this item is very cute, it is smaller then I imagined it to be. it is only about 3 1/2 inches in height. Since there were no dimensions listed for the item I had to guess the size by the picture. Was very disappointed when I discovered how small it was."
3,Tiny,Bought this ball for a Christmas present for my 15 month old daughter. Package arrived and I discovered that it is just one size above a choking hazard. Guess this will have to be a stocking stuffer because it is TINY. Cute toy but beware it is small. A photo with someone next to it or holding it would be much better.
2,"loved it, until it became choking hazard","My baby loved this little toy for a few months but as another reviewer stated, the wooden ring and the small little smiley face piece fell out. My husband luckily saw my daughter playing with this and snatched it away. Time to retire this toy."
3,"cute until it came apart, then a hazard","I bought this seven months ago for my daughter (and for a playmate's birthday party). It gets five stars for being cute and produced responsibly, two stars because it is so heavy when thrown, and zero stars because it just came apart on my kitchen floor, ejecting one of the little peek-a-boo characters, which is wooden and about the size of a foam earplug. Possible choking hazard, but luckily my baby is not one of those to stick every single thing in her mouth. If yours is, I'd be careful. This should be assembled using something more permanent than wood glue."
3,Cute but Very Small,"Maybe I didn't pay enough attention to this when ordering, but I expected a 8-10 inch ball...the box it came in was actually only 3 inches high. It is well made and cute for a little one, I just thought it was much bigger."
5,Great Toy!,"He watches intently as we roll the toy back and forth. He also likes to try to chew/suck on it and since it is made of wood and nontoxic paint, I don't have to worry about what he might be ingesting. I recommend this toy for other babies!"
4,unique toy,"Wonderworld toys are made in China but certified to be sold in the EU and USA so I decided to take my chances since EU standards are higher. The paint and material are made with non-toxic materials so I decided to add it to our daughter's wish list for Christmas.The toy was smaller then expected-I should have read the reviews on it...but otherwise it's a nice toy. I continue to change out the toys that I give our daughter to play with so this toy, like her others, seems new to her again. I think the little pegs playing peek a boo is cute plus the ball is small enough for her to grasp and play with."
3,Incredibly simple toy that children LOVE - (but can be choking hazard for infants),"WARNING: After writing the below review, I read other reviews warning about the pieces that come off, and that it should only be given to 3 yr-olds and up. Though this didn't happen to mine, I can certainly see how it could, and wanted to include the warning here too - it does have pieces that if come off, are small enough an infant could choke on.Original Review:I got this for my 1-yr old nephew for his first birthday. Out of all the toys he got, he like this one the best and rolled it around all day. It's the simplest of construction - just 6 little heads that pop out when gravity pulls them out, but he was completely entranced. It looks really strange/intriguing as it rolls around on the ground - as if there were some actual mechanism in it. (hard to explain). For 10 bucks, this is a no-brainer."
1,Easily the worst Marvel book yet....,"And that's saying something ...! It took all I could muster to finish this book (I only read half of the last story before putting it down in disgust). How all but ONE of these authors could make a awe-inducing character (when you really think about it)like the Silver Surfer, and make him a boring TOOL, is actually comendable. It actually makes you think if a character that can go anywhere in the universe is really interesting? And the answer must be no. This guy obviously can go anywhere and see anything, but obviously finds nothing of interest. . .... Only get this if you're a die-hard Silver Surfer fan, or a Marvel novel completist like myself."
5,Gotta luv it!,"From the moment I heard the first two songs, I stopped to write this review (and I never write reviews). Immediately hearing the first song, started to move and got right into the beat... this music just does it for me."
5,"Live Model Book One Artistic Nude Figures for Drawing, Painting, and Sculpture","This is a great book for those of us who do not have access to live models. The photography is crisp and clear, and the lighting is great- there are no details obscured by shadows. There is a really good selection of poses, with detail pictures of ""hard to sketch"" body parts such as hands and feet. Each pose is also photographed from different angles, which gives even more selection. The e book is very easy to navigate, and also has a print option, which is a HUGE plus if you don't want to be stuck at your computer trying to sketch. This is a great book!"
1,no marking on this carafe,"I find it impossible to have to use a meeasuring cup to know how much water I'm adding to my coffee....I've always had markings on the pot, so that I can put the proper quantity of coffee grinds into the filter."
4,"great performance, mostly quiet, but dust like crazy","I'm very pleased with the performance of these pads; they have an aggressive bite and great stopping power. (Even before I bedded them in they had excellent bite.) This car is retired from autocrossing and track days so they've only seen street duty, but absolutely no complaints about their performance at that.They appear to be very well made.I have noticed some minor squealing but it's hardly worth mentioning.The only downside is that despite EBC's claims, I'm getting a lot of black brake dust from these pads, substantially more than I got from the previous OEM Nissan pads."
3,FAIR: DEPENDING ON YOUR NEED,"This revised edition of ""Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology"" is comprehensive, clinically relevant, and fairly up-to-date. It has a good coverage (for degree students), although that advanced researchers may need something more extensive. Its ability to correlate biochemical terms and data is appreciated. But with just over 17,000 definitions, its listed price is a bit on the high side. Buyers could get a better illustrated, more voluminous Biochem dictionary at that price."
4,word and definition,i think this book have important words for me and for other student or sciencetist and i think the definition of this book is easy to read for me. finally its not expensive like a other dictionary thank you
1,Irresponsible seller,This book was delivered to me by the Post Office wet and totally destroyed.I was told by them that they were not responsible for articles that were not insured.I sent my complaint to the seller but received no reply.
5,No More Prilosec!,"I'm forwarding this review for my brother (who I purchased this for):This stuff is amazing. I've been on Prilosec for the last 3 years because of bad reflux. I just didn't like being on Prilosec (I felt it was giving me rashes and other issues). I've tried many times to stop taking it but I couldn't last more than a few days as the reflux was unbearable. I've been taking the HCL with Pepsin now for about 2 months and stopped taking Prilosec about a week into taking the HCL. I can't believe how well it works for me. Some reviews say they need to take large doses but for me I only take one or two each meal (depending on what I'm eating). As of this writing - I am having NO reflux/heartburn issues at all.I really can't say enough about this stuff - I'm so happy it worked for me. Maybe it doesn't work for everyone, but give it a shot cause it works for me!"
5,Best shoes,Iam verry glad that I bought these shoes.They are veryt convinient and they look amazing-everybody looks at them.They are perfect!!!
4,"Distinctive and at times sensual, but very single-minded.","Richard Kern's photographic and film works are immediately identifiable -- blending S&M, punk-rock, documentary and fetish styles into a sensibility that is at once bold and revolting, sensual and ugly.His photographs are more intriguing than his films, which suffer from too much emphasis on violence, oftimes bad acting, and shaky shot selection (and I'm not referring just to the handheld style). It's surprising how beautiful some of Kern's photographic subjects appear very often, just because his style has a complete lack of pretension that can be inviting.Granted, all the violent imagery, gun fetishes, and people (usually women) in compromising positions gets repetitive. But Kern is one artist you can pick out from the crowd on the spot, and his toughness can be welcome in a world of airbrushes and perfect bodies and makeup. You could even argue some of these subjects look more human in this style than in any fashion magazine!"
5,"excellent,excellent,excellent",i cant say enough good things about this book!the photographs are striking reverently disturbing master art with no fashion model looks. i highly recommend it.
2,High Expectations,"The concept was excellent, but the execution is disappointing. Maybe the format is just too big, as the size itself drew my attention to the mediocre photography, rather than the otherwise interesting commentary on pop fetish culture. If the intent was to lend immediacy to the subjects though casual photography, it failed, because the models were clearly posed. The style of photography may have work with unposed models (as in Kroll's photography) but it didn't work here."
2,Next please.... . .,I wasn't impressed with the photographs. I have a more interesting collection of ex girlfriend nudes then this book has to offer.. Save your money.
3,this one must get Catholics clapping,"Montgomery Clift as the priest in this film aboutthe love of a married woman for a priestwould be a crowd pleaser in Latin America?That he became a priest after learning his childhood sweetheart had marriedan important man is the subtext tothe theme of a priest bound by the confessionalnot to reveal what he has heard about a murder.The movie is intense and I thought in the trialthey would find the priest guilty.Karl Malden plays the detective who seems bent or ruiningthe lives of the priest and his loverwhen their blackmailer is killed by the church German refugeehandyman,but everything turns out right in the end."
4,A classic Hitchcock thriller does not disappoint,"This is the classic Hitchcock thriller. Wonderfully done, it takes place in Montreal. The movie begins with a Catholic priest hearing the confession of a man who just committed murder.Of course, the priest can say nothing. He cannot even say whether or not he even heard the confession of the man.The Catholic Church is treated respectfully in this 1950s movie. (Which is probably why it is never shown on TV!) It is not a religious movie by any means, but it is, like so many Hitchcock movies, an excellent character study on life, choices people make and how people behave under incredible stress."
1,DVD review,DVD arrived but had no audio. I tried it on 2 machines and had similar results. No new arrival of DVD has happened. This was a bad happening.
3,Cassocks Aren't For Everyone,"A standard Hitchcock plot device: the wrong man. Dark, sinister, foreboding, and claustrophobic with exteriors shot in Quebec. (Hitchcock lamely claimed he chose Quebec because the clergy still wore cassocks.)Essentially a one-actor film. Without Montgomery Clift (the priest), the movie may not have been possible. Most of the supporting players are outstanding especially Carl Malden (the totally focused Inspector Larrue) and most especially O.E. Hasse (the ungrateful killer) who was a star on German stage and screen before WW II. Anne Baxter (Montgomery's pre-priest squeeze and not Hitchcock's first choice), however, delivers a so-so performance (she was not an especially happy camper during production). Many script variations were considered, but abandoned in face of the censorship still prevalent at the time (early 1950's) including a Clift/Baxter love child and the execution of the priest for murder.A must for Hitchcock enthusiasts.WILLIAM FLANIGAN, Ph.D."
4,another Hitchcock classic,"Hitchcock's ""I Confess"" with Montgomery Clift and Anne Baxter is not necessarily among his greatest directorial acheivements. however, it is engrossing entertainment with Clift and Baxter both delivering stellar performances. any Hitchcock fan should enjoy this little gem."
2,"Nice light, poor humidifier","I purchased this to be a bedside humidifier, with hopes that it would quietly raise the humidity levels while I slept. Well, it's quiet, yes..no doubt because the internal fan is so insufficiently small that it only sends mist out a couple of inches before it plunges directly down to soak anything underneath it. It would do this at either the high or low fan speed, not dispersing the mist whatsoever. It's too bad, bacause the programmable timer is a nice feature.Buy a blue light blub and put a glass bowl over it if you want cool special effects; that will produce an equal amount of humidity as this model does and not soak your floor."
3,Simple Humidifier,"This is a pretty small humidifier which is pretty cool. It fits anywhere. There are no filters and it's very easy to clean up. This humidifier is for smaller rooms. If you plan on using this in a big room then you need to look for something bigger and more expensive. The blue light is pretty cool. You can use it as a night light or a simple light when you need to get up in the middle of the night. It is also pretty quiet. So far (2 weeks) this has worked pretty good. However, there are some cons.To start, there are blue lights above the buttons which are VERY annoying at night. They are pointless. I'm going to put black tape over them. The fan that blows the mist out could have been just a little big stronger. The price of this little gem is the reason I gave it only three stars. For $40 dollars I feel this is a little overpriced.Overall i'm pretty happy with my purchase."
1,Stopped working in three days,"I was excited about this product. It humidified my office, looked cool and even had some aromatherapy. Then on the third day of using it, it just stopped. The light went off and now the won't go back on. The fan doesn't work either so it doesn't humidify. In short, great concept -- terrible execution. It's money down the tubes. It just is not built to last."
3,over rated,works good but could use a little more power to push the vaporsto where needed.You need to set it on a chair right next to your bed because itdoes not blow far enough.
1,bad product,"This is a cute small item that lights up like a nightlight. As soon as it is tilted, allowing too much water to go into the top it will not function. The directions indictate this, however even after drying it out, the mist will still not come out...ever again! I purchased 3 of these and my kids tilted 2 of them and they ceased to operate correctly, despite the fact that they were completly dry before re-filling and trying again. I returned all 3 and bought another brand. This is crap. It gets minus 5 stars. Do not buy it."
4,"Small, but damn good","I'm giving it four stars (instead of five) because the thing is tiny. But it's solid, reliable, quiet, and it works. Very easy to use. No filter to clean. I use it to humidify my entire studio apartment. So far, I'm totally happy with it."
2,Don't bother,"I live in a very dry, high altitude climate, and a night-time humidifier is crucial. While I like that this unit is small and quiet, I dislike that only functioned properly half of the time. When it didn't work, it didn't emit the vapor, even with the fan on. When it did work, it drenched the furniture upon which it sat, even with a towell underneath. The ""vapor"" emits horizontally, but then immediately falls downward. Given the cost of the unit, the damage it can cause furniture, and that it functioned only half the time, I wouldn't bother."
1,it was great until it broke,"It worked nicely for about 30 days, and then it decided to produce noise instead of mist. When I called amazon, I was asked to contact the manufacture. When I called the manufacture, the people there were mean and unhelpful. They asked me to send it in for repair at my own cost."
4,Medisana Ultrasonic Personal Humidifier,"Excellent Product. Does exactly what I wanted it to do....especially in DRY-Aired Hotel rooms. Works so well, sent one to my son in the military deployed in the Sahara."
4,Little Humidifier That Could,"The Medisana Ultrasonic Personal Humidifier is surprisingly effective for such a little guy and simple to use...no complicated ""systems"" to figure out or replace, just fill, plug in, and turn on. I use purified water in it just like in my iron to prevent scaling. My husband can't handle extra humidity, so I keep the Medisana on a tray and just carry it around the house with me. It puts out enough vapor to keep me from drying out in our desert home, but not so much that it ""vaporizes"" my husband! We're both happy."
2,Medisana Ultrasonic Personal Humidifier,The product seemed to work well the first couple of weeks but has had intermitant problems since. It stopped working and a call to the customer service line revealed that the water had to be at a certain level for it to operate correctly. The mist originally seemed to flow upwards in the air toward your face but now seems to flow down and wets the surface the unit is sitting on. It has helped with my sinus condition but with the other problems I am not sure I would recommend this product.
3,Decent but not really worth the price,The footprint of this humidifier is great. It is much smaller than the photo would lead you to believe. I am a little disappointed with its ability to alter the local humidity. I keep it on my nightstand and it seems to assist in my sleeping but my hydrometer does not change. A full resevoir lasts just the one night. This isn't such a bad thing as it forces you to clean it more often.This would be a better buy if it were cheaper.
1,Stopped Working after 6 Hours,"Don't buy this product! I carefully considered the reviews Amazon's humidifiers before buying, and found that this one received fairly high ratings and was in my price range. After it arrived, I set it up right away and it seemed to work fine-- blue light and all. When I went to turn it on the second day, no blue light-- ok, I can live without that. However, it also could no longer emit mist, eventhough it was bubbling away inside as before. If you purchase this one, you may spend more time researching and ordering, then repacking it for return than reeping the benefits."
5,"easy to clean, lasts for years, handles a small room well","I've owned several humidifiers and this one has outlasted the others. After using is every winter night for 2 years, it hasn't`gotten any build-up of minerals on the nebulizer. It is easy to keep clean -- just wipe it dry. It still works like new, and I'll be using it again in my children's room all winter. It lasts only about 6 hours per filling, but that's enough to keep the air in a 12 x 12 or 15' room moist as long as we use it every night."
4,Humidifier,"Neat little machine, lasts for several hours. Best for small rooms. Love the easy refill. Tired of lugging the big ones around."
4,Cool looking in a dark room,"This product got 4 stars instead of 3 mostly because the blue light looks cool while the product is running. It does a pretty fair job of humidifying a small room too. The vapor is not hot, so it does not raise the room temperature."
2,Disappointing...,"This little humidifier gets everything around it wet! I had to raise it up on a block and put a thick plastic placemat on my nightstand so the wood wouldn't get ruined. It is also difficult to clean. I use only bottled water, as recommended, but it develops a pink film on it if it's not cleaned every couple of days. Overall, I am disappointed. Although it does emit a stream of vapor, it doesn't seem to do anything for my dry sinuses or dry skin."
4,Health Care,The product is wonderful but putting oil in the product causes it to malfunction. This putting the oil should be forbidden. I have ruined two of these products by adding oil.
1,"Bad customer service, poor quality humidifier","I agree with a lot of the other negative reviews that this is too small a humidifier to provide relief for anything but the smallest of bedrooms. But worse than that, the humidifier doesn't last. When it broke down I called customer service. There was a long wait before my call was received, the rep was unsympathetic and told me they would only replace the unit under their 1 year warranty. My unit was outside that warranty period so there was nothing they could do to help. My only option was to buy a new one. I will not be buying Medisana again."
1,Worked for 6 months then broke,"This humidfier worked well for about 6 months, then it stopped working. After trying periodically for a few months, I was unable to contact the Medisana customer service for assistance. Unfortunately, I have to conclude this is a piece of junk and the customer service is also useless. Don't waste your hard earned money!"
2,Not worth it...,Mine stopped working after about a month. It's currently with the distributor for repair...not sure I'll ever get it back. Produces little mist. Save your $$.
1,Really small and broke after a month,"This humidifier is actually quite small (the photos might make you think it's bigger than it really is). Furthermore, the construction is flimsy and the unit stopped working quietly after a few weeks. Now it's practically unusable since the motor noise has gotten excessively loud. Not recommended... and the blue lights are cheesy anyway!"
4,Great for small rooms,"This humidifier is great for a small room. I would have given it 5 stars, but the way the nozzle is pointed makes the water/condensation/steam(?) (whatever you call it that comes out) flow downward and dampen the bedside table. I would prefer it if the nozzle pointed straight up."
3,Takes a little patience,"I ordered the Medisana humidfier upon the recommendation of a friend, to replace a very noisy humidifer in my office. The Medisana product works well, but needs frequent refilling. DO NOT USE THE EUCALYPTUS OIL, which plugs the output nozzle. Why they supply it is a mystery. If the output nozzle stops working, remove it and dry it thoroughly before replacing it. This makes no sense, but it works. The little blue nightlights aren't an issue at work, but they would drive me crazy at home. Luckily, you can shut the nightlight off.UPDATE: 12/2008 - My humidifier stopped working for no apparent reason. I filled the reservoir, pushed the buttons and it ran for about 30 minutes before stopping, never to come to life again."
2,Dissapointed,"I purchased 2 of these humidifiers from the sharper image. I am assuming they are the same type and model with the sharper image logo. This was absolutely the best humidifier I ever purchased, it was convenient, easy to use, and compact enough to sit on your nightstand. My dissapointment came that when we took them out to use for the 2nd winter season they only worked a few days. We followed all manufacture directions using distilled water and cleaning them daily after use. The went from turning off after a few minutes to not working at all. Sharper Image assumed no responsibility for them since they were a year old and the only help I got was to send them in to a address to be repaired with no phone number. I had no idea where they would go, how much it would cost, nothing. So, great idea but expensive if they need to be replaced or repaired every year. I almost purchased 2 more but decided it wasn't cost effective."
1,Stay away,This humidifier quit working in less than 2 months. It does not lid or blowing any mist. Contacted Medisana and not response. Medisana is very short-sighted company.
2,no power,"Was excited about this after reading the reviews, but it is so small and imho did not produce enough moisture in the air to warrant the pricetag. After buying it and trying it, I went out and bought a larger one. Barely ever use this."
1,Don't Buy this product...,"I purchased this item and it worked wonderfully for five minutes. I followed every ones suggestions from the remarks column and nothing worked. I e-mailed Amazons return address and they sent me a new one. The second humidifier worked for three days and I loved it but it failed also. I just threw it away and said, no more. Wish I could have been one of the lucky consumers and gotten one that worked. I really liked the small features. Although I agree you have to be right below the mist to get the benefits. Good idea anyway."
3,too small too mild,this is good as a show piece than a effective Humidifier .... better go for something bigger and more efficient .... sorry to say this ....
3,Small and querky ?,IF you overfill it it will not work !!Very compact....I would only reccomend if you are extreemly short on space....Small rooms.
1,The Road to Happy,"The authors have an introductory statement: "" We assume you are smart, if not give this book to someone else..."" Well, I assumed the authors were smart and obviously I made a wrong assumption. The book is absolutely the dumbest thing I have ever read. I tossed my copy in the trash."
3,Kronos Would be Proud,"All in all, not a bad outing for Buck.Too many slow songs for my taste.The standouts are All Tied Up, Five Thirty-Five and Born To Rock.In that order.Besides being a great guitar player, Roeser has always been a great singer as well.Would have made a stellar EP.Bonus points for including Neal Smith and Dennis Dunaway from Alice Cooper.Still, I've had this on vinyl since it came out, so it'll be nice to grab it on CD finally."
3,Basil,Basil Rathbone (in my opinion) was absolutely the best SH without a doubt. He (I don't know this to be a fact) could have been Liam Neeson's inspiration and was a great actor for sure.
3,"GOOD, BUT STILL AWAITING CLASSIC HOLMES ON DVD","Granada did an excellent job in bringing Holmes to a mass audience; however, these television productions simply cannot compare with the best of the Rathbone / Bruce features. It is rather a shame that the only DVD's available to date from that series have technical issues. It can only be hoped for that some company (like Key Video in the 80's) will step forward and do justice by the greatest Holmes of all. In the meantime, though, these television episodes will have to suffice."
4,"We all know the content, it's the transfer...","The other reviewers here have had their say about the quality of the production in its entirety, which I wholeheartedly agree with.What has been mostly overlooked in the other reviews is the image quality of the conversion. It is passable most of the time, but in low light scenes there is obvious artifacting that creates a busy, static-laden blocky buzz that for me at least is very distracting.In my opinion unnecessary costs were cut in the production of this DVD (inferior encoding to MPEG-2) that reduce my rating by 1 star."
1,Technical problems with two copies of this DVD,"This DVD appears to be encrypted or mastered in a slightly unusual way. My DVD player could not play it, nor could any of the normal DVD players on my computers play it. This was true of two copies of this DVD that I bought.Eventually I discovered that VLC (VideoLan Client) on the Mac could play it and we did get to see it in the end. The episodes are good, but I agree with most of the other reviewers in saying that the quality of the DVD is far below what is expected. There are sound problems on ""The Naval Treaty"" and a piece of dirt appeared to get caught in the projector's film gate at one stage during one of the episodes!"
3,good show,"This disc contains the first four episodes of the Granada series. I found all the episodes on this disc to be very enjoyable. I agree completely that Jeremy Brett is great as Holmes. The quality of the disc isn't outstanding but it's not terrible either. There are some sound problems at the end of ""The Naval Treaty"" and in one scene in the middle of ""The Solitary Cyclist"". The picture doesn't look as good as you would expect to see on DVD but it doesn't look that bad either. I consider this disc to be well worth buying."
3,The era brought to life,"Just a brief coda to the previous remarks.""A Scandal in Bohemia"" is a wonderful introduction to the series, establishing its marvelous sense of time and place. The long shots down Baker street, with gas lights aglow into the distance and the procession of carriage and pedestrian traffic create a city teeming with life and energy. In such scenes, each individual appears to have a life story that extends beyond the briefly glimpsed moment.Alas, I must agree that the quality of this first volume is far below expectations, with some inexcusable lapses in the transfer. Fortunately, the quality of volume 2 is stunning."
5,Excellent,"Fantastic quality, and Holmes is dependable as usual. This TV series is the best. I am waiting for the rest - a boxed pack of the entire series would be awesome."
5,The Definitive Holmes,This series is terrific as the original manuscripts were placed in Victorian England so are these finely executed settings and scenes.It is my opinion at this time that Jeremy Brett is the definitive Sherlock Holmes even surpassing Christopher Lee or Basil Rathbone and David seems to be truly Watsonesque.
3,Story not much worth telling,"Coffey tried to write a pretty good novel here; he almost succeeded. The narrator, Garrett, is a nasty s.o.b. who thinks he's better than all the hard-working people around him who remain faithful to their spouses. The accusations of CIA involvement in coke-peddling are old, tired and hackneyed. Coffey hasn't spent much time in Florida, and except for one flying cockroach and some stereotyped Cubans, the story might have been set in Alaska. Next?"
1,Enviromentalism,"If a reader wants to know a few ""syllables"" of Spanish it's fine.Otherwise, a tree was wasted!"
5,Cardiovascular Nursing Secrets,Excellent resource book. I use it often in my practice. It is broken down into easy to read sections and covers all of the important aspects of cardiovascular nursing. I highly recommend it to anyone working in the acute critical cardiovascular area.
4,Cardiovascular Nursing Secrets Delivers,This is a great reference book to have. It is easy to browse and find what your looking for. I recommend it for anyone working in a CCU or ICU.
3,A nice blend of spices. A little too sweet for my taste though.,Rock 101somthing lake hartwell and boats and stuff. Bass fishing and the Army Corps of Engineers. Sorry for the random words. Apparently I have to write at least 20 of them for data mining purposes.
3,Kind of rough but looks nice,"This is the second set of sheets I've ordered off Amazon and although I find these sheets very pretty, I feel that they're a little rough compared to the ones I previously ordered. It's true that they wrinkle quite a bit as well. I don't think I will buy this set again although for the price I paid, I'd gladly keep it. The blue color is very pretty and I like the embroidery on the hem (my husband doesn't though, he prefers plain sheets)."
4,Nice but wrinkles,Nice quality sheet set for the price. The depth of the pockets were great. Fit over the mattress very nicely without a wrestling match!!! The sheets came out of the dryer very wrinkled! A good buy.
4,California King sheet set,"The sheets were far better than expected. Soft, pretty blue, and lovely detailed embroidered ends of the pillows and flat sheet. I'd recommend them for anyone to buy for the price. Not as big as I'd like as my bed had a big pillow top."
2,alittle disappointed,My product arrived with 2 rust stains on it that will not come off. This is probably the only product that has been disappointing to me in all my orders in the past.
5,One of the best war documentaries ever!,"I am buying this for my dad who was in Army Intelligence in WWII and trained many, gifted European POW's as Army Intelligence staff not far from Camp Richie a few years after the war.This is one of the the best written and certainly most humorous documentary on WWII I have ever seen. You would love to spend a weekend with the guys in the film just listening to their stories and enjoying their spirit and heart for God, country and others. These are the kind of men that have made America great in he past. May God give us more like them in the days ahead."
2,Disappointed with sharpening,"I thought I had discovered the perfect combination of triangular pencil without the too-large size of the Tri-Conderoga, but then the Tri-Write proved to be very difficult to sharpen in my mechanical pencil sharpener. The pencil leads kept breaking despite my taking every care. I'm going to stick with the basic black hexagonal model and maybe try the Mirado Black Warrior."
2,Too small for tiny hands,I hadn't read the reviews carefully and I was disappointed when they arrived. They are standard size number 2 pencils that have been reduced in size to make them triangle shape. Too small for my grandchildren to hold as their fine motor skills are not advanced enough yet.
4,What can I say? They are pencils!,"And yet, their triangular shape is easy to grip and does not roll on the bench. They were reviewed and highly recommended in a woodworking publication. I like them."
5,Getting a Good Grip on Things,"Does your hand get tired writing? Do you frequently change your grip on the pencil? Have a kiddo with a grip that must be fixed? Then these pencils are for you.Upon first glance, these look like regular pencils. As you pick one up in preparation to write, you discover that your fingers easily adjust to the perfect position. The triangular shape is both comfortable and strong.Dependable and long lasting Ticonderoga pencils come through again. Tri-Writes are made with top quality cedar, strong graphite lead, and a secure eraser head. They are the preferred pencil for all my students. Try a box. You will immediately feel the difference!"
1,This inverter is JUNK!!,"I bought one of the AIMS 2,000Watt continuous (4,000W surge) ""pure sine wave"" inverters for around $400.00 bucks to power up some lights, fridge, and oil fired furnace during power outages. The inverter could barely run my fridge alone!! AND it generates so much RF noise, forget turning on the TV!! I installed a noise suppressor which did help, then upgraded to a Magnum Energy MSPAE4048 It was well worth the extra $$$. If you want a decent inverter steer clear of the AIMS junk... If you want a cheap piece of crap, that you'll be disappointed with - I've still got my AIMS 2KW inverter and can give you a good deal on it!!"
1,dont buy it,This is capable of running the same appliances that a modified square wave inverter is. Electronics ....NO!!!. Am sorry I bought it and more sorry I paid so much. Buy a power bright inverter instead. This thing pours out rf.
4,As expected,This product is what I expected it to be. I had researched it online and got what I thought I would.
4,Great for a home brew fridge/freezer,"I bought this controller to help maintain the temperature of my fridge for my home brewing. This product works as expected. The temperature seems to stay with in 2-3 degrees of the setting, which is great for my needs. I would recommend this to anyone needing a inexpensive means to control the temperature of a fridge or freezer, especially for home brewing setups."
5,Very good product.,"I ordered this with the hope that it would override a refridgerator's thermostat, so that I could use it to hang prosciuttos and salamis for curing. The intent was to get the fridge's temp into the mid-fifties range. It works very well in doing so, keeping the temp range between 54 to 58 degrees. It is easy to install and set the temp to what one would like, with only a little bit of experimenting with the controls."
5,Couldn't Ask for Better,Does exactly what it supposed to do. Came calibrated perfectly.Turned my rarely used stand alone freezer into a bottled wine cooler @ 52 degrees.Less than 10 min. to install including clean up!Outstanding product!!
5,Happy with this thermostat,Installed this thermostat to convert a chest freezer into a refrigerator. It is a simple installation and is working well. Temperature setting on the thermostat is within a few degrees of what I am measuring in the freezer.
1,Shipping Weight,"""Shipping Weight Six Pounds"" I think not. Other comparable controllers are labled as two pounds. It's probably a typo. Let's hope so."
3,Having some issues,"I am using this to keep the temperature normal(35-40degrees) on my deep freeze freezer. For some reason (even when the door is kept close) this thing will get anywhere from 40 degrees to 20 degrees without changing the dial or opening the door. It almost completely froze my keg because the temperature dropped so drastically. I have the thermostat set to 40, and temp gague is in the middle of my freezer with a freezer thermostat right next to it. Is anyone else having an issue with this if so were you able to resolve it? I noticed that one guy put his in a class of water, i might give that a try."
5,"Perfect, does just what I needed.","I over-rode the fridges internal thermostat, replaced it with this one and now have the exact temps I want. Perfect. Could not be simpler to use. Would buy another if needed. Great way to turn a freezer into a fridge(kegerator)or to reduce a fridge's temps further than these new electronic digital displays allow."
2,Not calibrated correctly,I used this for about 3 weeks and found that I had to adjust it to 26 to keep my freezer at 32 degrees. Since the calibration appeared to be off I sent it back and am getting the digital controller. The copper wire sensor on this one also seems like it could break eventually if it is moved around. The digital controller appears to have a sturdier sensor. I'll find out.
5,Excellent,Needed this for freezer control and it works great. Johnson has always come through for me and this item did not dissapoint
3,good for the casual reader but not for serious study,"This book has a wonderful collection of ancient literary sources for the study of Artemis, but these are not presented with meaningful context. Obscure references of minor aspects are given the same emphasis as major cult epithets, leaving the reader with a fairly skewed view of Artemis in ancient Greece. Epithets are given with a pronunciation guide, but the pronunciation is modern Greek, not ancient Greek, which is quite different, and that difference is neither acknowledged nor explained.All in all it's not a bad choice for the casual reader, but people who want to pursue a more in depth and well balanced study of Artemis in the ancient world should look at Larson, Cole, Lefkowitz, and Blundell instead."
1,Absurdly OVER PRICED!!!!!!!!!,"This book is extremely over-priced for what it is. It's like a long pamphlet with info-bites, rather than a book. For $25 I would have expected a tome...or even a mini-tome, but this is the size and length of a 4th graders novel...likely less. It measures 8-1/2"" x 5-1/2"", and the pages - before you get to the appendix, number only 126. As I breezed through it I found nothing new that I could not find by simply doing a keyword search on line. I'm returning it, since I can search the net for free. Ridiculously over-priced, and if you're not annoyed by doing a bit of online research, your time will be way better spent doing that, than ordering this over-priced book."
2,Problematic,"The latest novel in the popluar mystery series has taken a turn for the worst. I didn't enjoy it as much as the other books, and the premise was far-fetched and unlikable. Like other readers, I am upset that Jessica's friends from home didn't make an appearance, either by person or phone. Jessica's snoopiness is daring, more so in this mystery, and I was worried where the author was taking the story. Pass up on this one, or borrow it from the library."
5,One of Jessica's Best,"This is one of the best Murder She Wrote books thus far. While normally the stories set in Cabot Cove are the most enjoyable, this one set in Mexico with her publisher friends is just as good. I completely forgot about Seth and Mort back home and this time they were not missed. There's a lot of action right from the start and the ending is very well done."
