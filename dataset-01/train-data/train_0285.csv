5,Clear and concise.,"I really enjoyed reading this book. In the past I have been confused with different ""interpretations"" of the book of Revelation. It makes sense that the Revelation was written for the church of that day.I love the way he explained the symbol 666, and the fact that Armagedon was the name of an actual mountain.God is not the author of confusion, and all the various ""interpretations"" of this book causes controversy among God's Beloved, the church. It is not exhaustive, but give a clear understanding. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to have a simple, but accurate, explanation of the book of Revelation."
4,The other side of an obscure writer,"As Ivonne Bordelois states in her preface, there's more to Alejandra Pizarnik than meets the eye. The gloomy writer that thrilled everyone in Argentina and other Spanish-speaking countries with her obscure, death-stained poetry turns instead to be a gay and solicitous friend who tries to help her friends and comments on projects and books. This is Alejandra's other side, although as you turn the pages her psychological and money problems start marring the happiness she had achieved as a promising poet. Bordelois' comments are always helpful and enlightening. A very interesting piece of reading for those who are familiar with Pizarnik's writing."
5,"Thee Viceroys, The Pins and so much more!","This comp is worth buying for the tracks by Thee Viceroys (if ya dig, you should check out the Big Bad Sound of Howlin' Andy Hound) and The Pins (see All the Night Sky and Radar). Besides that, there is a plethora of indie, garage and unconventional gems in all fidelities possible."
2,Don't Let's Start,"I realized when I was four songs into this album that I was still waiting for it to finsh getting started and go somewhere. Paul is an excellent pianist, and he certainly has the New Age Piano technique down. Unfortunately, he does nothing with it. His melodies are simple, and he does little to embellish on them once presented. Rather, he focuses on repetition with slightly varied flourishes. The most interesting piece is ""Hunter's Heart"" which is so close to David Lanz's ""Desert Rain"" as to be considered a cover. Paul will be an interesting composer to watch, once his skills mature."
5,Soothingly simple melodies that touch the soul.,"I love The Looking Glass. It is the kind of music that can be played over and over again without becoming tiresome or irritating. Perfect music for contemplation, study or simply relaxing."
4,Not just for chess players,"I was concerned that I wouldn't like this book, since I don't know the first thing about chess. But happily, this was not a problem. The book had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, wondering what was going to happen, and I was interested not only in Isaac's fate but in all the minor characters too -- Janek in particular was fascinating. My only complaint is that all the many POVs in the story sounded the same -- which may be a problem with the translation more than the original writing. I can't read Lithuanian so who knows."
4,'Click Here for More',"In color and Mananra's artwork is stunning! Decent story and follow up to 'Click'. A little less sexcapades, but still pretty damn cool."
2,Dissapointed Loyal Customer,"I've been a loyal fan of Manara for years and I've never been dissapointed by this publication,(Click 2). I wish I had bought another issue from him. Issue like the African Adventures or something that takes place in Europe. Although this is one of the best materials he's made I wouldn't be discourage from buying it.I am dissapointed that he used a James Dean look-a-like that took place in Hollywood. I moved from Hollywood years ago when the city seems too fake. I'm not a fan of Hollywood like I used to.Now I can't stand the Hollywood and James Dean he used in his Click 2. I recommend first time buyer to purchase Click 1, Indian Summer and Gulliver's Travels. These are proven reliably perfect comming from me."
4,"""Brother Bear"" meets ""Captain Planet""","Naysayers may decry WHAT THE PARROT TOLD ALICE as propaganda for young minds, you can't go wrong when you've got Dr. Seuss as a trailblazer for kids' eco-fiction. The beginning reminds one of ""Brother Bear"". A young man is transformed into a parrot to atone for a crime against nature. The young man-turned-parrot ends up, Lorax-style, in the home of Alice Smith, a preteen who, although bright, has no idea of the environmental devastation her species, namely humans, wreaks upon tropical birds and rainforests. While the book and its sequel present grim and what this reviewer thinks of as exaggerated portraits of man's inhumanity to the whole universe, the book also provides an imaginative gateway to thinking about the future of life on this planet as we know it...and as we want it to be...straight from the parrot's mouth, right to our hearts."
4,"Review of Puccini's ""Misa di Gloria"" LSO","An excellent rendering of a seldom-performed work from the young Puccini. Soloists and orchestra compliment each other well. Particularly liked the fugal section. Certainly foreshadows the ""greatness to come"" from Puccini...would highly recommend this recording."
4,FastCap 3rd Hand Carry Bag,"I purchased this bag to carry my poles for my laser level and it works well for this purpose.The bag is well made with a two zippers that allow you to open the bag almost all of the way down one side for easy access and roomy enough for the intended job.My only suggestion/complaint is that there is no shoulder strap, which would make carrying the bag easier.It does have a pair of loop handles at the center of the bag."
5,Hits the Nail on the Head,"As a 23 year resident in Miami (from NYC) I was astonished at Didion's eloquent articulation of what I haven't been able to describe but have pondered over these many years--the cultural and cognitive disconnect between native Americans and disgruntled Cuban exiles. They talk about LA, but Miami really is Never-Never Land with impossibly obdurant and involuntary immigrants who have no clue or stake in the American values of reasoned discourse, free speech, and fair play and no desire to abandon the cultural attributes that have allowed them to suffer under one form of tyranny or another for a long long time. This books explains what they are thinking--the Cubans--and why they behave the way they do. Well-researched, accurate, and beautifully crafted prose."
2,OK,"This is a complex and detailed history chiefly of Cuban exiles in South Florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various U.S. administrations. In that sense, it is the story of two cities - Miami and Washington - and two peoples - Americans and Cubans.I have an objection, though, with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse, the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup.The author, in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose, apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers. It is, in that sense, a boring little disaster of a book."
2,Outdated---Ancient History,"Exiled Cubans in Miami up to 1987. This is real old stuff. I wonder why this book is still being published. Felt like a collection of shorter magazine--newspaper articles compiled to look like a real book. Many long, disjointed sentences. Could use an updating. There must be better books out there about this topic."
4,Read this book for a preview of Clinton Round 2,"Reviewing this history of the health reform effort, the central failure of the first Clinton Administration, is an excellent way to anticipate the shape of things to come in Clinton II. The authors, masterful insiders, use their unprecedented access to the highest levels of power to demonstrate how universal coverage, a goal supported by virtually all the key players, drowned in a sea of amateurish, hubris-ridden ineptitude on the part of the boomer generations' ""best and brightest"". Will history repeat itself in the form of another domestic Vietnam? Or have all the president's persons learned from their mistakes the lessons as set forth by the authors in their incisive conclusion, in which they conclude that the sickest entity of all may well be 'The System' itself"
1,Only Washington insiders,"could offer the following assessment as a critique, that Hillary Clinton was too committed to universal care to be considered unbiased. These MSM practitioners fall into the trap of all such: they think that sin resides equally on all sides. If, as they show, Republicans, industry lobbyists, even the Christian Coalition, and ignorant citizens, are arrayed against a project blaming the brave at the Alamo is stupid. The fact that President Obama is now facing similar problems after trying to avoid all the Clinton's so-called errors shows that this is not a fight that is remotely fair. And the press, including the Johnson's and especially the Broder's are in large measure to blame because they adopt a ""he said, she said"" everyone's a sinner stance that gives the opponents, once again, an unfair advantage. This book does not note the failures of the press to do their job, to find and report the truth. Save your money."
1,So Much for your Ignorant Post,"Top 'o the charts, ma. JACKSON'S HEIGHTSArista Nashville's Alan Jackson doesn't have a 9/11 anthem on his new album, What I Do, but that didn't prevent it from going to #1 in its first week, with 182k+ in sales..."
5,Love it,we started this train when my son was born and i had a hard time finding this one and it is perfect
5,Practical Evangelism,"Floyd Schneider brings a different approach to evangelism, one that anyone can use- ask them to read the Bible with you! No more telling others what the Bible says, but having them read the truth for themselves. All the students in my Personal Evangelism class read the book, and now many of the students are involved in a Bible study with people they met in town. I've read the book, and it's right on. I recommend this to anyone who wants a real and practical way to evangelize."
4,A great common-sense alternative,"In our efforts to share the gospel with those we meet, Schneider recommends that our primary goal should be to read the Bible together and allow Scripture to speak. He advocates using the gospel of John as the starting place.This has great merit on many levels:- It allows God to work through Scripture- We do not need to know every answer to every question- This creates an ongoing Bible study where Jesus and his work (the gospel) can be seen in a full way.Schneider does more than focus on his core premise, however. He surrounds his premise with sound and helpful advice on how we can better enter into the lives of those around us.Evangelism is often defined in the context of a short encounter. While we should always be able to share the gospel, I think the short encounter is overrated. Schneider's approach is well suited for engaging those we connect with regularly. It not only gives the gospel, it gives the gospel in context.Waldean Wall[...]"
3,Calphalon pan fine but lid doesn't fit,"Pan appeared new but was not in it's original packaging, which was awkward for a gift. Apparently the original lid was swapped by the 2nd party vendor for another Calphalon lid. The lid shipped with the pan it did not fit the pan, but luckily I have another Calphalon lid that will work. I'd rate the pan a 5 star and the lid a 0."
3,"works well, very expensive","like the glass lid, felt quality, works well. way too expensive at list price. good buy at 50% off."
5,Good air filter,I think that this air filter is worth it. I replaced the stock filter on my ducati 695. The stock one looked a lot more restrictive than the KN. I think the sound was louder after i put it on too. Havent noticed any real performance gains nothing noticeable but im sure it helped a bit.
3,Does not fit the XM Xpress RC,"Product description stated that this was comatible with Xpress RC, but the case is much too small for the Xpress to fit in it. I haven't been able to find a compatible case and decided to try this one because the price was low. Oh well I tried."
3,XM Zippered Case,Works very well in protecting your XM deck when moving it from vehicle to vehicle or from vehicle to home.
5,Wish they had more,"I bought both of Saraya's albums when they came out. Still play 'em regularly today. It's just good ol' American kickass rock and roll! Love the riff on Hitchin' A Ride. I still remember most of the lyrics to both albums. Sandi's voice is fantastic, and the guitar work is sharp. They certainly stand out of the hair band crowd, and I have a lot of hair band CDs. Just wish they had put out more than two albums..."
5,One of the Great Children's Books,"I can't believe this great book is out of print! Robert McLoskey's pictures are hilarious, and at the same time nostalgic. Waking up one morning to discover that his head is missing, our poor man tries various substitutes. As he visits the county fair, his friends and neighbors hardly seem to notice that he has substituted a pumpkin or a turnip for his missing head. The story's ending is safe and predictable as he finally wakes up in bed with his own head properly in place. For the sake of the current generation, I hope publishers will rediscover this lost classic"
1,DON'T PURCHASE THIS DVD!!!,"This DVD (and it's second volume) are absolutely unacceptable as anything other than complete trash. What a disappointment! For starters, the video and sound quality are horrible! It honestly looks worse than a VHS video. (No joke here.) There are noticeable glitches, it looks and sounds as if someone was adjusting the tracking on a VCR as this was being transferred to DVD! Most of the videos have obvious edits and skips in them, and most (95%) of the songs have the beginnings cut-off (mid-lyric) and the ends just chopped. I don't believe one video is complete. Some videos are so washed-out it's ridiculous. There are NO extras at all, nor are there any credits or record company recognitions listed. Please don't waste your time on this thing. Unbelievable!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS THING!!,"Being a fan of music videos from the early 80's, I was looking forward to this DVD. What a disappointment. I honestly suspect that this disc is a bootleg production that has somehow managed to sneak by the record labels. For starters, the video and sound quality are horrible. It looks worse than a VHS video. There are noticeable glitches throughout. It looks and sounds as if someone was adjusting the tracking on a video cassette player as this was being transferred to DVD! A couple of the videos have obvious edits and skips in them, and ""Breaking Us in Two"" by Joe Jackson is missing about the final 1/3 of the song! There are NO extras at all, nor are there any credits or record company recognitions listed, furthering the notion that this is a bootleg. How many compilations have you seen or heard where the original source is not credited? Please don't waste your time on this thing."

1,Deceiving Disk,"I thought this disk contained music. It is a short, rather boring interview with the band, which, frankly, was a waste of disk space. Don't waste your money!"
2,microtek - windows 95 beware,"i purchased this scanner because of the dpi and the easy to use buttons on the front - however not being a ""computer guru"" didn't realize that you cannot use it if you have windows 95. the usb connection is not supported by windows 95. I am not sure how it works but wanted to warn others about the usb issue."
3,The Wine-Dark Sea,Great service as always. Books are attractive and seem well constructed but the printing and editing leaves something to be desired.
5,Don't Read This Book. . .,". . .without first reading Truelove. Wine Dark Sea is the 16thbook in the Aubrey/Marturin series and as usual, the writingis as rhythmic and sensual as the sea itself. O'Brian does hisusual great job of spiking the plot with layers of meaning andtwists and turns. He is also at his best in emphasizing the'novel' part of his historical-novel niche.If this is your first experience of the series though, you mightfind the characters and motivations a bit hard to follow, especiallysince so much groundwork was laid in Truelove. Some diehardfans may be disappointed by transport of so much of the actionfrom the sea to the mountains.Still any O'Brian is better than no O'Brian at all and this is one ofthe best books in the series.--Lynn Hoffman, author of New Short Course in Wine,The andbang BANG: A Novel ISBN 9781601640005"
2,Too Heavy on Naval Termonology,"This is the second Aubrey/Maturin book that I have read. I did not enjoy the first one. I figured, however, that I had to give the series another try because Patrick O'Brian has so many fans. I fared no better with this one.I just cannot get into these books. O'Brian's repeated use of archaic nautical words and phrases is more than distracting. It is overwhelming and it buries the stories. I would suggest staying clear of this stuff unless you are well-versed in 18th century naval termonology."
2,My Comments are Strictly on the Performance of the CD Reader,"Unlike Patrick Tull who has performed the readings on the previous fifteen books, Richard Brown is the reader on this CD production. But Brown is no Tull. His voice is dull and repetitive, and it has little differentiation between any of the characters. More than that he doesn't seem to try and make the story interesting but seems to be in a hurry to get the whole thing over. Whereas there is some great spirited writing in the book you wouldn't know it from listening to the CD, he could just as well be reading from the phone book.BTW the story is great as usual and deserves a four star rating. So read the book or listen to the cassette.Zeb Kantrowitz"
5,Gz20090709,Patrick O'Brian continues to impress with his ability. It is unfortunate that he passed away before completing the Aubrey story.
5,"Amazing, As Usual","Wine-Dark Sea is the sixteenth in Patrick O'Brian's wonderful 20-part nautical series. It is also the final in a four-part mini-series, as volumes thirteen through sixteen are an ongoing circumnavigation of the world. In this installment, Aubrey and Maturin and the HMS Surprise finish their adventures in the Pacific, land in Peru and then round the Cape into the Atlantic on their way home to England. For fans of the naval wars, there are some good 'ol rip-roaring chase and battle scenes. The Maturin crowd will find their hero high in the Andes examining wildlife and carrying on his intelligence activities. A wonderful worthy addition to O'Brian's series."
2,Didn't Live Up To My Expectations,"From the reviews and the hype I had expected something a little meatier but I was a little dissappointed with what I ended up taking away from this book. Swanwick seemingly jumped from place to place, idea to idea without any transition. Information was suddenly thrown at the reader and the reader was left to use his or her imagination a great deal to fill in the gaps. That's not to say that the ideas weren't wonderful - they were. And the imagery and language was well executed. Swanwick is an excellent writer but Stations of the Tide didn't show off everything he could do as an author."
4,"Insidiously, perversely clever. Quite brilliant!","Nice to see the book reprinted - it certainly deserves a wider audience than it enjoys now. Swanwick's surreal novel is fast-paced and intelligent, with engaging characters and sometimes way-out-weird situations, alternately delighting and shocking. To describe the plot would be to do the book injustice - it is much more than a mere search by a faceless beauracrat for a renegade wizard. The book grabs you right from the first word, and drags you breathless and amazed up to the surprising ending. I think it's indicative of Swanwick's brilliance that my favourite character is the AI briefcase!"
3,Vivid distance,"The problem with telling stories that involve different layers of reality is that it can be hard for the reader to track which set of rules the story is playing by at any given time. Rich with imagery, fetid with ambiance, this is an interesting story in a fully imagined world, but one that never fully engaged me as a reader. The early chapters had too many lists and throughout the book the choice to devote creative powers to the dark and mucky views made me impatient. While not being quite on the same level of grotesquerie as China Mieville's work, his fans should check this out."
1,Remember how he stold your money the first time?,"Well, he got me for a doubleheader as well. Two useless chuncks of bond paper promising to change my life and many I knew, so many we all got together and roasted marshmellows and had fun...then said farewell to our poetic dreams and stood in line for Mc Jobs."
1,Why Pay For The [Japanese] Version...,"I rate the Digitally Remastered version of the Gauntlet Soundtrack 5 stars, but I ask why pay double for the Japanese version that doesn't even say if it has been Digitally Remastered. I understand the Japanese versions of a lot of albums offer extra tracks over other releases, justifying paying the extra money. But the track listing is the same as the other much cheaper Digitally Remastered release of the Gauntlet soundtrack available. So I ask why bother listing the Japanese release of the Gauntlet Sound track?"
1,DVD-R release!,This release is not factory pressed DVD - it is actually VHS copy burned on crappy CMC DVD-R media! Be aware of this when buying because that is not mentioned anywhere... :(1 star to DVD release! :(((
5,Great compilation!,"I purchased ""Totally Hits 1"" several months back when it came out. I was so pleased with that one, that I had to purchase this CD, as well. You get some of the biggest songs of the past year including a few which are still current releases.Of course, there are a few songs which, although not bad songs, could have been left off in return for the inclusion of more popular songs. I question the inclusion of, let's say, R.E.M. or Donell Jones. I think Destiny's Child or Macy Gray would have provided a little more punch.All this considered, however, it is still a great CD for the person who likes to listen to nothing but today's biggest hits without any of those annoying radio commercials. I recommend this CD as well as the ""Totally Hits 1"" and ""Now, That's What I Call Music"" (volumes 1, 2, and 3) CDs."
4,Rescuing Great Singles from Not--So-Great Albums,"This collection works best when it retrieves great singles from albums that aren't that great. That's what the initial Totally Hits did. Volume 1's choice of ""Believe"", ""Summer Girls"", ""This Kiss"" and ""One Week"" were a good reminder of why these collections sell. Why spend [money] for one good song on a CD, when you can get 18 tracks for the same price? Volume 2 does an equally good job of getting the best singles out of ho-hum albums: Missy, Third Eye Blind, Lou Bega, LFO (again), the Madonna Austin Powers song, Lonestar, ""Genie In A Bottle"" and Donell Jones. A good investment and a decent compilation. This is a good mix tape that you don't have the time to make."
3,Good CD,"This CD is OK, but not as good as the first one. All the songs on the first one were big hits, but this CD only had a few hits. I only liked some songs like ""Never Let You Go"" by Third Eye Blind, ""Natural Blues"" by Moby, ""Girl On TV"" by LFO, ""Take A Picture"" by Filter, and ""Genie In A Bottle"" by Christina Aguilera. The rest of the songs were OK. I hope that if they make the third one of this collection it will better than this one and that all the songs on the CD will be big hits."
3,OK,"This is an ok collection of hit singles,the problem with thes kinds of cd's is by the time they come out they are no longer popular for example Mambo no.5 has been over played and is hardly heard of.This does have some great song such as Falls Apart.If you don'tcare what is in the top 10 as of now get."
4,"The best,","I do like some major productions couldn't tell what about you know? I like Lou Bega's Mambo No.#5,Lonestar's Amazed,and Sarah Mclachlan's I Will Remember You.If you into pop,R&B,or rock.get this CD today! bye!"
1,Totally Hits 2 Is A Total Mess!!,"I'm still racking my brains to figure out why I bought this. The only good song on here is Madonna's ""Beautiful Stranger"". Everything else is just contrived and boring. Whitney gets a remix (& I HATE remixes), TLC and Monica get stupid songs put on this, and everyone else just bites, especially Lonestar. I hated their song ""Amazed"" when I first heard it on the radio. If you want a good collection of hits check out ""Totally Hits 3"" or anything from the ""NOW"" series (exept 2 & 6). ""TH3"" is wonderful! I'm glad a phoenix rose from the ashes of ""TH2"". Save your money for a better CD than this."
5,Great pan!,"This is a terrific pan--- nonstick is very good, easy to clean, looks good, comes with see-through lid-! I have had it for 1-2 years and the nonstick is still 100% in effect.I use it for pasta, scrambled eggs, making sauces, heating soups, sauteing, and even browning meats.I can't think of one thing that I do not like about this pan (besides I own only 1!)."
5,Calphalon Short & Saucy 2 1/2 qt saucepan,"This was the most recommended by Cooks Magazine. I had searched locally and not able to find. Found on Amazon.com at a GREAT price. I'm a Southern Cook and grits just pour out with absolutely NO sticking. Sauces cook evenly and without sticking. Clean up is a breeze. Great product at a Great price, no shipping charges, too!"
4,Dents,"It fell on the floor and is now bent--I know I dropped it, but I expected a sturdier pot--and now the lid won't fit because the pan is dented."
5,Great pot!,I love all the calphalon lids and pots and pans. They work great hold even temperature and are nonstick too!
2,Really Bad Coating,"I sent an older non-stick pan in for replacement because it was flaking. They sent this as a replacement. It is a piece of crap. After less than 6 months, the coating is coming off. I use it almost exclusively for rice and never use anything but safe utensils. I have always like Calphalon, but this is not a good piece."
4,Lid handle will burn fingers,"I do like this pan, it's a replacement for a Calphalon 2-qt that I ruined after many years of use. I preferred the smaller size, but I like this anodized finish much better. I wish the handle on the lid was heat resistant like the older, cheaper 2-qt pan. Even after a year of using it, I sometime forget to use a oven mitt and am burned. Such a simple thing would seem easy to fix."
5,Calphalon 2 1/2 qt non-stick saucepan,"I am pleased with the performance of this pan. Wanted a safe non-stick saucepan, and thought about the more expensive Calphalon models, but this has a good price/quality index. The glass top is a plus. It's made in the USA so that is also a plus for me."
4,"Calphalon is good, but could be better","The pros: Calphalon is a great material for cooking, it has a very uniform heat distribution and is very solid. On this piece, the shallow design is perfect for simmering up your favorite sauce. The curved lip makes spills a thing of the past.The cons: Calphalon is not dishwasher safe, so make sure you are ready to hand-wash your new pan. Also, avoid drips down the outside of your cookware at all costs - Calphalon stains like crazy! They DO sell a cleanser, haven't had a chance to clean mine yet - so I hope it works. Finally, this is NOT the standard depth pan, it is SHALLOW, so make sure you know what you are buying.Final word: This is a fantastic price for this piece of cookware - can you believe this is going for 60% off? Problem is, if you want to complete the set, you had better be willing to shell out some serious dough. If you love to cook, can afford Calphalon, and don't mind the clean-up, this is the pan for you."
5,Cook's Illustrated Recommends for 2006,"Just got my March/April 2006 Cook's Illustrated magazine and it rates this pot one of the best small nonstick saucepans, and its certainly the cheapest! I love mine."
4,Need strong arms,"The handle on this is not the most ergonomic, your wrist bears a lot of the weight."
5,Calaphalon product purchased from Amazon,"I received it in perfect condition and found that it fit my needs. Already have other Calphalon products, so I knew that I would not be disappointed."
5,Calphalon Contemporary,After using this set I would never go back to cooking with anything else! Great price when you watch for a deal
5,great!!!,"these are nice size pots. they're very easy to cook in and clean and i have no problems when i use them. i bought two, and they're both great."
1,"For the second time, this saucepan disappoints.","About 2 years ago, I bought one of these saucepans and really liked it...until the non-stick coating deteriorated after about 18 months of use. (Yes, yes, we were careful about utensils and how we washed it.) Even though I prefer kitchen equipment that stands the tests of time a bit (much!) better, I liked the pan so much that I replaced it. Well, after only 6 months or so, the non-stick coating on pan #2 has started peeling off. NOT acceptable. I won't be buying anymore of this brand of saucepans."
5,"A quality saucepan, solid, attractive, works well.","I bought this shallow saucepan and it works rather well. It has a quality feel, very solid and sturdy, and is attractive too! The nonstick is good quality and food cooks more quickly because the pan has more surface area. I use this pan for soups mainly. A little heavy, but isn't every quality pan heavy? Looks attractive and I got a great price, less than it is now. All in all, a great deal! Much better deal than I could have gotten in the store, that's for sure!!"
5,i love it,"this is a sauce pan that any chef will love. i looks nice, easy to clean and the handler which i found people complaining it is the right size."
2,"Great, till the coating lasts","I purchased the pan back in 2006 and it was wonderful, better than just anything Walmart carry; for the records Walmart was the course of my cookware (or whatever you call them) back in grad school's salary. Unlike most pan, the sheet of metal is thick and by soem magic heats up really fast. Now after carful using (alwasy wooden spatulla and hand wash) teh coating started to peel of soem tiem middle of 2007 and the process is still on. Now, it sticks up everything, only thing I can really cook is sause; I used to saute my food a lot and now I can do so only if I use a different pan. Overal, not worth the extra $; I think a more resonable way to get nonstick is hard anodized stuff."
3,pouring,"Pours exceptionally badly - makes messes all the time. Metal is thin and light. Inexpensive, but you get what you pay for."
5,Very Versatile,"This is a great pan - I use it everyday. With the lower profile it fits the burners on my smooth-top range better than most sauce pans. The price was right as well. I will probably be purchasing a second one because I often have two or more things going at once, and I just don't like my other pans after using this one!"
5,Excellent quality,"by error i select 5xl, my bad. but the quality of the sleeve is amazing, so i order again the same item with the correct size. excellent product."
2,"Try ""Stranded"" instead","The story behind this movie is one of the most amazing stories I ever read or heard about in my life. I was a teenager when the crash took place. I read the book ""Alive"" back then and I just read it again.No questions about it: this is the most amazing story about survival and dealing with death and hunger.As for the movie unfortunately it lacks all the reality of the story.The main actors are weak; the director is even worse; I bet he read the story real quick and came up with this lame scenario.After 70 days in the mountains all actors are still looking clean and healthy which was never the case.This story needed a director like Robert Zemeckis of ""Forrest Gump"" or Ridley Scott of ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and the movie would have been an award winning one.2 hours is too short for such an amazing story.I say stay away from this movie; read the book or watch ""Stranded"" instead."
2,New Age Glop,New Age sentimentality messed up a great story. The original Mexican version was much better--but it seems the Mexican firm has now also been messed up. When will film makers learn to leave a good thing alone.
4,Alive- The Triumph Of The Human Spirit,"Alive is a powerful and controversial movie about the famous rugby team plane crash, in which the survivors had to result to cannabilism to stay alive. Alive is an excellent movie with a great cast, who present a moving tribute to the actual events that occured in the Andes Mountains. A must see movie which will reach into your heart and show the true meaning of the human spirit and what it can do in times of tragedy."
2,Incredible Story -- Weakly Portrayed,"I just watched this movie, and have immediately placed the book ""Miracle in the Andes"" in my Amazon shopping cart. The is an incredible story of survival, a thought that cannot escape you as you watch the movie. However, the movie itself does a rather weak job of portrayal. Most of the acting is seriously flawed and just not realistic. Scenes are frequently over-dramatized -- for example, lots of overdone slow motion waving to rescue helicopters...with Ethan Hawke hanging out the door with smiles and waves to boot...he seems o.k. for a guy who just spent two months eating people and climbing out of the mountains with no gear. The story carries the movie, and if it were fiction, it would get just one star. This story truly deserved a better movie portrayal. If someone just doesn't read books, they'd likely thoroughly enjoy the movie. I'm am quite confident that the book in my cart will be much, much better!"
3,"Good stuff, but no where near the power of the book.","Solid movie. For fans of the book however, this picture does not come close to evoking the emotions felt in type. A much better job could have been done, not by the actors, but by the director, in capturing the sheer weight of the undertaking, and especially the expedition. I did not have the overwhelming feeling of accomplishment at the end that I did when reading.The ending is true to the text, but glossy and rushed.Uplifting, to be sure, but yet another example of missed opportunity in turning an incredible book into a so-so film.Three stars."
5,Alive is real,"From the days when I worked in a movie theatre, this movie still dawns on me as one of the best live to tell stories of all time. Buy it, rent it see it..."
3,not updated to 3.5,"For all those that do not want to do the research themselves: The Monster Manual II and Fiend Folio books included in this set have NOT been updated to the D&D; 3.5 rules. All three books are hard-covers though.Note: I have not purchased this set (for the abovementioned reason), but this review was based on posts on the WOTC message boards from people who actually owned this set."
3,"Interesting, but too much detail!","This book was interesting, but provided way to much detail. I had a hard time getting through it. However, I did learn a lot and was surprised by it. On the whole I was glad I read it, but would not recommend it to others."
2,Not worth the money,"When I bought the Pet Portage Sport Backpack with the intent to wear it while I ride my bike and be able to take my Dachshund along, I took the chance that it would fit my body, and his, since the weight requirements matched. The ad said it was on sale for 35.99, so I took a chance, since I'd been researching and shopping for a long time now.When it arrived, I realized that there was nothing specifically pet special about it, and there was no way to secure the shoulder straps in front of my own body, as would be on any real hiking pack, especially if you are carrying any kind of weight in it.So, it didn't fit me quite right, but I figured I was only out 36 bucks... til I got the credit card statement and discovered I'd been charged 75 dollars.... and of course, no response from either the seller, nor Amazon as I tried to find out what happened during ordering.I can't use it, I can't return it, I can't get a refund. Not happy."
5,Love the smell,I sooo love the smell of this tea. I actually haven't tried it yet but I gave my co worker a box of it amd she loves it
5,Very flavorful,The organic peppermint tea has an intense flavor. This tea has a number of uses for me. I use it in an Iced Spice tea blend that I make; as a single cup of hot tea at night to calm my coughs; as a digestive aid when I eaten food that is a little spicy and to flavor a simple syrup for plain iced tea.
5,The best peppermint tea,"This is by far the best peppermint tea I have tasted. If you brew it as suggested it is strong and very aromatic, if you prefer it weaker just brew for a shorter time."
5,One of the best,This is one of the best summaries of AmericanHistory ever written.NOT Politically Correct- No Liberal revisionism.Excellent stories about those who made our country great
2,"dull and lifeless, if competent","I came to love history relatively late in life. Unfortunately, this book exemplifies why I came to it so late: it recounts the facts without examining any assumptions, has little tone or style, and absolutely minimal narrative. In other words, this is an old-style survey that you would find on a shelf at the high school library, the kind of book that teachers thrust into young hands as a duty to to study, not as something to enjoy. I skimmed this book and felt no wonder, no desire to read further, and no incentive to remember what I had read so laboriously. It is a complete and utter bore.Fortunately, this style of writing has long since become obsolete. There is great popular history available - e.g. the new series of Oxford histories that is first rate - that also satisfies academics.I cannot recommend this book. It is designed for captive audiences, not the person who reads for pleasure or even as the enthusiastic autodidact."
1,Disappointing,"If you are looking for good old classic Mother Goose that you grew up, with these are not the books you want. I was disappointed to find that I have never heard of over half of these nursery rhymes and the ones that are familiar have been changed. On the up side, the illustrations are great and the book is okay for a child who isn't familiar with classic Mother Goose."
5,who hasn't had a car like this?,If you're used to hearing the sound of falling metal from your jalopy or hoopty this bumper sticker is for you! Acknowledge your flaws and faults and the world winks and nods.
4,Cute little statue to serve as a great tribute to a tricolor JRT,"Love this little figurine. It sits on a shelf to pay tribute to my JRT, Harley. It has almost his exact markings, and I love it."
3,A Solid Effort From D.A.T.,"Double Action Theatre (D.A.T.) worked with an A-Team of producers like D'La Vance (worked with Color Me Badd & Bell Biv DeVoe), Isaias Gamboa, and Leon F. Sylvers III who had worked with huge names like Shalamar, the Whispers, Stacy Lattisaw, the Spinners, the Brothers Johnson, Glenn Jones, Howard Hewett, Gene Page, Lakeside, Real to Reel, Midnight Star, SOS Band, Blackstreet, Guy, Janet Jackson, and Big Bub of Today. The lead single ""Something Special"" failed to cross over on the pop and R&B charts hittin No. 78 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart in the year 1992. The album failed to chart, but chart positions having nothing to do with the material on Double Action Theatre's debut album, shouldn't be overlooked."
3,BIble Adventures,"I don't remember if I finished any of these games or not. I used to love the story of King David and Goliath. I believe that was on this game. I always met up with Goliath, came close, and then got pelted with those rocks. The sheep were adorable the bears annoying. My other favorite was the ARK. I loved carrying around the lightning bugs in the jar. The lightning, and the tucans were my favorite. I wasn't much interested in the baby Moses one. I did get past the first two levels. Course, I could go down and bring them up to play it, and then come back and review it. But I'll stick with this. My favorite of all the Wisdom Tree games is Spiritual Warefare, but that is another game..."
1,Rip off,Rips stuff off from classics and compresses it into a short non-fun game. It wasn't even legally made by Nintendo.
1,don't waste your money,"After one time use, the nonstick coating was peeling off, and all I used was a wooden utensil.Don't waste money on it."
2,Failed black comedy,"This is a black comedy that doesn't make it. The director thought it enough to hire big-name English actors and have them do droll cameos, but he neglected to make sure that the over-all production was amusing. It isn't. After an hour of being unable to produce a smile, the film just lumbers on and viewers will be wise to look elsewhere for entertainment. A big-budget flop."
4,Great sound,"Use this in sound reinforcement events, wedding ceremonies, etc. Great pick up compared to the one that came with the SLX Shure unit we bought. Shure is the best!"
4,"Great for urban use, but additional tire liners recommended...","These tires run and look great on my bike. They were easier to install then my previous tires. However the only con I see with these is that they are a bit weak in terms of flat protection. I recommend you also get tire liners and/or flat resistant tubes with these. I have already gotten a flat on the front tire. But this was more likely because of the cheap tube I used in that tire.Aside from that, I have had no other problems with these. I recommend this product!"
5,Wonderful tire,"Replaced some SLK Semi Slicks on my Hybrid bike. These are not only quiet, they ride nice and are great for light and minor trails. Michelin quality shows here. Would recommend again!"
4,country rock,Great tire for the price. And I always am happy with Michelin products regardless. I recommend them for a nice street tire.
5,"Michelin Country Rock tires, 26x1.75","nice tires, I put these on a bike that only gets used on the street. Very grippy in the corners and a nice stiff sidewall, pumped up to about 60 psi & they're perfect, roll pretty fast too. The weight is as advertised, about 560 g's for the steel bead version."
4,Michelin country rock tire,"This tire is good for someone who wants a tire with good roll with a not so aggressive tread for casual riding or commuting. That being said, the Michelin name speaks for itself. As far as durability The jury is still out. Great tire for your bike that you ride when you ride with your kids."
2,More info,This is a good book in some of it's own ways. I think it should have more info about each of the different conures. I own a pair of green cheeks and they are not rare nor are they expensive. They are the cheapest of the conures. Also they are really sweet and not loud at all. They do get nippy in thier older age. The over all of the book was pretty nice though.
4,Perfect for when you want to read about cougars,"I got this book as some sort of ironic joke gift, but have since found it a fascinating, yet seriously spooky collection of stories.Cougars are not to be trifled with - they will totally eat your children!"
1,Don't use this seller !!!!! item never received,I've contact this seller with no response. I never received my purchase. buyer beware.
4,The air from the rear ends of cows is destroying the ozone layer,"""Daddy Has A Tail!"" is the most retarded album of all time. It reminds me of when I was a little retard way back when, and a song title like ""I Miss Her Beer"" would set me off on an hour of hysterical convulsions followed by a round of vomiting and drunken skateboarding. If you dare call yourself a ""punk"" in our current era of industry goons wholesaling safe rebellion, stick yer toe in the warm goo the Cows left behind and see if yer really man enough..."
5,Priceless Anecdotes,"This excellent book of anecdotes is a necessary addition to any teacher's library...Or anyone's bookshelf who does any speaking at all. A good anecdotetells you more about a person than a whole volume of factual material...And this book if full of interesting, often humorous stories. I love this book. Thanks, Amazon!"
4,An unexpected gift from the past.,"I first saw the Mahavishnu Orchestra in 1973 when they opened for Frank Zappa in Cincinnati.I collected all of their albums and many solo releases ever since.This is a wonderful gift to be able to hear something from one of my favorite bands,that I didn't even know existed.My only disappointment is that all but 1 song were released previously on either the live BN&E album or Goodman & Hammer's ""Like Children"" album.Despite this,""The Lost Trident Sessions"" is a lost and found masterpiece."
5,Lost Trident Sessions,"For Maha-Ork fans and fusion lovers -- this is a rare glimpse into the final days of this legendary band. Studio takes of cuts that made it to the live release, BETWEEN NOTHINGNESS AND ETERNITY, are here as well as compositions that appeared in another version on Hammer and Goodman's post-MO release, LIKE CHILDREN. One new song by McLaughlin finishes this CD's offering. The musicianship is as good what MO was cranking out in their prime and that nervous energy and explosive soloing remains a constant. Hear quality engineering and production of new riffs, new solos, new songs, and get rid of that inferior bootleg of this unearthed treasure. (c: Tons of great historical liner notes and pics. Strongly recommended fusion - Editor of ECLECTIC EARWIG REVIEWS"
3,Great Drumming by Billy Cobham,"Mahavishnu Orchestra was certainly one of the preeminent fusion bands. When ""The Inner Mounting Flame"" was released, people were awe-struck by the virtuosity and the new sound that is now referred as Jazz Rock Fusion. Next, ""Birds of Fire"", their second album, was released -- it remains a classic to this day. And now we are presented with a whole new, unreleased album cut from that holy cloth.Well MO fans, this new venture is just not that good. If you already own ""Between Nothingness and Eternity"" (MO's third and live album), there is very little new here. And while it sounds much better than BNaE, it really isn't up to the quality of tIMF and BoF. Mclauglin's guitar playing sounds muddy and sloppy. The band lacks tightness, making the material sound hurried and thrown together. The saving grace is Billy Cobham's excellent drum work - clean, crisp and agile.Being a MO fan, I had to have it. If you're not, don't bother."
3,Use with discretion.,"Well, if you read the review that quotes directly from the original Crawdaddy interview, the reviews that tell you where all tracks but the last eventually surfaced, and the few reviews that actually analyze the LIKE CHILDREN tunes technically, you'll get a pretty good idea what you're in for...EXCEPT:1) For a studio album, the sound quality here is decidedly inferior. The most obvious defect (the only one that really bugs me) is that volume increases and decreases erratically and greatly.2) Jan Hammer uses one, and only one patch, on his Mini-Moog throughout the entire album (which suggests to me that these were never intended to be released as finished performances, that they were more-or-less run-throughs)."
2,Disappointing,"I consider the Mahavishnu Orchestra's Inner Mounting Flame one of the best recordings ever made. But the Lost Trident Sessions is disappointing. Where the Inner Mounting Flame matched fiery playing with brilliant compositions, the Lost Trident Sessions has the feel of ad-libbed warm-up exercises. These are great players every one of them, but I do not think their reputations are well served by the contents of this disk."
5,Fantastic - the masters,"After reading so many reviews.I felt the need to get my two cents in. This is a phenominal recording. After the recording of ""Birds of Fire"" you can see the progression of the song writing of John for this band.You may also notice that there is a blend of the ""live""improvisation of the "" ""Inner Mounting Flame"" and sound clarity of "" Birds of Fire"". There is so much here more so than Birds that remind me of the spontaneous improvs of what John learned with Miles. There is so much honesty. This makes it such a beautiful CD. Wow!!! I can't stop listening to it.It keeps geting better after every listening. One of the best EVER!!!!"
3,Now we know why they got lost,"I'm not surprised Mahavishnu couldn't keep it up. The first two albums were mighty tough acts to follow. But it's kind of funny to think that with all the spiritual grooviness they projected, the band and music fell apart over ego issues.I don't hold it against 'em. ""The Inner Mounting Flame"" and ""Birds Of Fire"" are such classic works, anything that followed is icing on the cake. I have a feeling, though, that if the other boys had kept their egos in check and deferred to McLaughlin, a third masterpiece might have emerged. As has been demonstrated by their solo works, they did have what it takes to crank out terrific original music--this just wasn't the ensemble to do it with. C'est la vie.Hardcore fans of the Orchestra should probably own this. But buy it used. Also, be forewarned: it's only about 39 minutes long."
3,Hold The Holy Grail Talk...,"It certainly is wonderful to have a ""lost"" album of music from the late, great Mahavishnu Orchestra, but to compare it favorably to any of the band's official previous releases is more than a little off the mark. The studio versions of the compositions released 25 years ago on ""Between Nothingness and Eternity"" pale in comparison - sluggish, studied, not extremely well-recorded. Play McLaughlin's solo on ""Sister Andrea"" here beside the one recorded for the live disc and you'll see what I mean.Certainly even 25 years later this is the best Jazz Fusion disc released in 1999. The ""new"" material is a welcome addition to the canon and it certainly came as a big surprise to me when I heard this was coming out, but a Holy Grail it's not...maybe another teeming tributary entering the ocean of joy and spirit that was The Mahavishnu Orchestra!"
2,Mediocre Mahavishnu,"The live versions on 'Between Nothingness & Eternity"" absolutely smoke this album.The complete Central Park concert (promised for CD release back in the 90s...still waiting) is something fans should clamor for, not studio outtakes that the band rejected.Btw, it's true that a sticker on the CD release of 'Inner Mounting Flame' years ago promised 'Dream' as a bonus track -- but the sticker was wrong, the track wasn't included. So this *is* the first official release of the studio version."
2,Great nerveracking music,"If you like solos at a 100mph and basically a wall of noise, then you might like this, personally I didn't care for it despite the glowing liner notes."
1,Not the correct Book,"I ordered this book for a gift and it came with the correct cover and had a cover page inside that was correct. But it also had a cover page for Five Plays by Lord Dunsany. And the rest of the book is plays from Lord Dunsany, with no more mention of Ustinov. The last play also ends mid-sentence. Do not buy this book. Printed poorly, as well."
4,Keep this with your bible. (No offense.),Many books are written with sound advice but what makes this book different is it can be used as a daily reference book. Easy to read and easy to carry. If a critical situation arises this pocket book can be there to save the occasion.
5,The only brand I'll use.,"I'm a house-painter, and this is the only brand of brush that I'll use. If taken care of properly, a Purdy brush will last a life time.The angle on this brush lets you get into smaller nooks and crannies with ease, and makes cutting fast and effortless."
4,"Top-of-the-Line Uniform, Well Worth the Money","I have owned multiple Ironman uniforms as part of my practice of karate-do, and they are unquestionably the highest quality uniform that a casual martial artist can own. The fabric is soft and comfortable to wear, even first coming out of the package, and the material is thick and highly tear-resistant. I have been thrown by my uniform multiple times, and it still just as strong and durable as it was when I bought it. The thickness of the uniform delivers a high level of snap, and moving in it sounds and feels good. I absolutely recommend the Ironman.(As a sidenote, the black version of this uniform does tend to bleed the first few times it is laundered, which was slightly disappointing, and also is why I neglected to award a full five stars. Otherwise, I have been very, very satisfied.)"
1,design flaw,"I have had this vacuum for about a year. I absolutely loved it. It's very very quiet and really just a nice, simple machine. BUT...the other day the prong broke off of the cord when i tried to plug it into the wall. When I took it to have it fixed, the guy told me that because of the way the vacuum was made, i would have to completely replace the entire cord winding mechanism...and of course, this would have costed about as much as I paid for the vacuum. The cord winding spool is wired to the vacuum and you cannot just replace the cord. Just FYI. I ended up buying a Hoover Wind Tunnel canister vac from this same company (Allergy Be Gone) and I love it. I have no idea if it has the same design flaw, but i will say it works much, much better than the Electrolux. The first day i had it, i picked up three canisters (it's a bagless) of dirt and cat hair off of what looked like clean floors. In my opinion, it's money better spent."
3,Workout!,"Wonderfully quiet; pets don't run from,great on hardwood floors or carpet w/ with a lower nap such as a Berber HOWEVER very difficult to push on regular carpeting. Leaves little ""clumps"" after doing it a few minutes that require you to remove attachment and suck up with the wand. Half my house is hardwood, works wonderfully there, but in bedrooms with more plush carpet very difficult to push. Have owned for 6 months now. Will be replacing this one soon; will give to my daughter for use in her college suite, which is a rather expensive vacuum for a dorm, but this makes it too difficult to use for my shoulder."
1,Manufacturer's description misleading,"While the vacuum does everything it is supposed to I feel cheated that the description says the HEPA filter is washable and it is not! On their own website,Electrolux has described it as washable while neglecting to add that it is optional and can be purchased for $30. Most dealers will tell you that it is washable because that is how Electrolux is marketing it to them. Check the Amazon site and you will see it too! Without the washable filter one has to pay $15+shipping for each filter replacement. The suggested schedule is one for every fifth bag change.Thats a lot to add to the cost of the already expensive vacuum cleaner.I contacted Electrolux and received no help from customer service. They denied that the website mentions the washable filter - I have copy of it. Calls to the home office have gone unanswered. I might return the product because of the false advertising. Just wanted others to know what they were getting."
1,This is an Eureka- not truly an Electorlux,"As my vacuum repairman put it, ""That's not an Electrolux, that's Eureka JUNK."" And it is.... I have had it in the repair shop twice and it is not a year old. He explained that Electrolux sold the rights to Eureka to put the Electrolux name on the Eureka line... I asked why Electrolux would do this.......MILLIONS! There may be a misrepresentation lawsuit somewhere in here....but who would want to take the time?...."
1,Hard to find service for this vacuum,"We loved this vacuum for the 10 months that it worked. It is quiet, great for hardwood and delicate rugs. However, one day it quit working and NO ONE in our area will service it. The electrolux website lists 10 service providers in our area but not a single one will touch it. We are told that this item is an Electrolux knock-off and no one can get parts for it. I fear we have purchased a $200 disposable vacuum."
1,Plastic,After having a silverado vacuum for over twenty years the cheapness and poor quality of this vacuum made me send it back. I prefer quality that lasts than a cheap product that does the trick for a couple of years. I was very disappointed because I bought this vacuum based on others high reviews.
5,i love my electrolux harmony!,"I bought the Electrolux Harmony on Amazon more than a year ago - a refurbished one. It is awesome! Lightweight, quiet, powerful. I live in a 2-floor apartment and have a downstairs neighbor, so I wanted a vacuum that is quiet, easy to take up and down stairs, and really gets the job done. The Electrolux Harmony is perfect. The suction power is great - I've accidentally sucked up a sock on more than one occasion."
2,not for pet owners,"I'm not thrilled with this vac. Mostly because of the pet hair and dirt tracked in from pets. It seems like I have to stay in the same spot and ""encourage"" it to vacume up anything. Twice the work of my old vac. Not as I had hoped for the money. Maybe if it had been 80 dollars I wouldn't be as disappointed"
4,Nice Industrial Design,"The downside for me was the lack of a simple hardwood floor brush. Hence 4 stars. The upside is really slick design, light weight and quiet operation."
4,I really like the quiet part!,"We have had the Electrolux for about a month now and it seems to be all that we asked for. I would have to say the best part is how quiet it is; we were, indeed, able to vacuum while the children were sleeping, though watching TV and vacuuming was still only done with close-captioning! The vacuum is light-weight and seems to pick the dirt up off the carpet. We have Berber carpet and I wonder how effective it would be on plush carpeting, as the agitator brush doesn't, to me, spin as quick as our last upright did.Overall, I am pretty happy with the purchase."
3,No warranty on parts - only motor,I purchased the Ultra Quiet in November 2006. The power nozzle and the cord locking mechanism have already failed. I spoke with Electrolux today (april 2007) and they advised the parts are not covered under warranty and they apolgized for any inconvenience.The Power nozzle was priced @ 124.00 to replace - which is more than half of what I paid for the unit.I have owned Electrolux brand all of my life and this is by far the most disappointing. I would not recommend this model for those that expect quality and longevity in a product.
2,Truly Discouraged,"I too loved this vacuum when I first purchased it. It was quiet and everything seemed to be just fine. The turbo nozzle lost its wheels, lost its suction and became torn and battered in a short period of time -- less than a year. The paper that came with the vacuum indicated I could purchase a new turbo nozzle for approximately $30. I thought, ""Great"". When I called to order it I was informed that the price was now $125. There was no way I was going to pay that amount! In addition to the problem with the turbo nozzle, the retractable cord now retracts whenever it feels like it while I'm vacuuming. Definitely not worth the money that I paid for it."
2,Nice unit but attachments are poor and scratched my floor,"Overall the unit has a nice feel to it and is quiet as expected. However, the concern is with the attachments. We have dark hardwood floors and therefore any scratch becomes obvious. Unfortunately the attachments for the floor rely upon either a brush or red felt to guide the front of the attachment. In short, grit got caught under the attachment and scratched my floor. I was obviously very disappointed and returned the unit. I have since purchased a Bosch which is ideal in that it has wheels which support the main head attachment on the front and the back and therefore reduces the chance of scratching."
3,"Light weight, quiet, bag too small","I've owned this vacuum for a year. For a vacuum, this machine is quite. The unit is also small and light weight. The light weight combined with the large, folding handle makes this unit easy to lift and carry around. Power is adequate for house cleaning.Since the unit is small, the area alloted for the bag is also small. The biggest drawback for me is that the bag is too small. I have house plants that shed leaves. Sucking up a few leaves fills the bag. If you suck up only dust, the small bag most likely won't be much of an issue. If you like to use your vacuum to suck up anything that winds up on the floor, this may not be the unit for you."
2,electrolux cannister harmony,"For the first 4 years I loved this vacuum cleaner, then the turbo brush broke. Not the brush itself but a plastic ring that keeps it attached to the hose. I replaced the brush with a regular brush and that one lasted about 6 times and is not powerful enough on the carpet. I now have to decide if I want to buy another turbo brush for $130 or so or if I want to invest in a new vacuum cleaner. If electrolux would have not have used the cheap plastic parts both brushes could have lasted a lot longer. I would not buy this brand again. The plastic parts are too flimsy and do not last."
3,3 1/2 Years Of Light Use - 1 Broken Attachment,"I bought this vacuum 3 1/2 years ago. We don't have pets, don't wear shoes in the house, there's only three of us, and we use it maybe once a week. Light use by anyone's standards. After 1 1/2 years the rug attachment (with the spinner) failed. I tried to replace the broken piece (roller opening had widened/torn over time and turns and shakes violently in the shaft) - they do not make it easy. I searched the internet and found myself in a vortex of parts, how the heck to you find a replacement rug attachment? You don't. Idiotic. We've been using the hardwood floor attachment since then. Not impressed with this vacuum but am stubborn enough to use it till it falls apart completely."
4,Is good until you need replacement parts,I just can't seem to find a replacement attachment since the one which we use broke. We call the company and a replacement attachment seems to cost as much as the whole vacuum. The vacuum worked pretty well while it was in good shape.
3,Harmony Vacuum Cleaner,Nice product for the price. It is very quiet and convenient for hardwood floors. Came with carpet attachment that I did not know would be included. Not sure if it a genuine Electrolux product. Manual states to contact Eureka for repairs.
2,Disappointing longevity,"This vacuum works well on hardwood floors. It is lightweight. The attachment for carpet does not have a power head so it doesn't work so well if the carpet has much dirt or pet hair. The bags are expensive and do not fit well in the compartment. My main complaint, though, and the reason why I would NOT recommend anyone buying this machine, is that it does not last. It is all plastic. And the plastic parts break and render it useless. We have had it for 4 years and now it's headed for the dump. What a disgrace! My previous vacuum was my grandmother's Electrolux, which she got decades ago and used regularly. It was metal, durable, useful for a lifetime (or more). This vacuum is a cheaply made, poor imitation and Electrolux should be ashamed for falling so far below the bar they set so many years ago."
3,Not Sturdy Enough,"I loved this vacuum cleaner at first. It was quiet and powerful. But the turbo nozzle broke, and the price of a new turbo nozzle went up $95 in one year. Also, the cord now creeps into the vacuum while we're using it, and doesn't shoot in like it used to when we push the cord retract button. The company should stand behind the product and work harder to fix problems and defects, while keeping prices of replacement parts in line."
3,Great vaccuum -- misleading advertising,"This vacuum is great. Very powerful, very quiet, very ergonomicallydesigned, very cute. BUT...I know someone else has already posted this info, but I just checked itout myself and was amazed to find the exact same thing. All of theadvertising for this vacuum (including the manufacturer's descriptionon the Amazon web page) extoll the virtues of its ""washable HEPA H12filter."" However, the other reviewer is exactly right -- this filter doesnot come with the Harmony vacuum. You must purchase this separatelyfor $30. The Elextrolux website also clearly implies that this vacuumcomes with a washable filter. What a crock! Somebody call the betterbusiness bureau! Somebody call Consumer Reports! Don't let them getaway with it!But I will say again, this vacuum is brilliant. It's a wonder of design andsimplicity. It is to other vacuums what the iMac is to other desktop computers."
1,"Powerful suction, flimsy parts","Although this vacuum has powerful suction, the quality of the plastic wand and cleaning attachments are not consistent with the cost of this vacuum. The carpet attachment does not come off easily and in my case, broke off from its collar. I had to spend nearly 40% of the original purchase price to replace the wand and attachment which were NOT covered by the warranty. Overall a poor value and not recommended for the price."
5,canister vacuum review,"This canister vacuum is great, please note I mostly have hard wood floors and tile flooring. The suction is awesome even on bathroom tile. It is unbelievable on dust.The head is slim so can easily go under sofa and chairs. I do have some carpeting you will need to slide button for carpeted areas also will need to switch to turbo speed. You cannot beat the lightness. I can lift with one hand which works out great since I have a 5 mo old! Note, I ordered the canister bags extra when I placed my order, vacuum only comes with one bag."
2,Read this first nothing else matters,"Regardless of all the virtues of this vacuum, there is one important issue that seems to be overlooked by all these glowing reviews. When your floor tool breaks and it will...(mine broke at one year) you can't buy a replacement! Yes you read this correctly. Electrolux does not sell a replacement floor tool. So you now need to duck tape your vacuum together or buy a new vacuum. End of story"
2,"Parts don't last, terrible customer support","The hardwood floor attachment has a pair of felt strips on the bottom along the intake. One of them fell off within a month and the other one fell off within a year. As a result, the attachment doesn't perform as well and it scratches the floor. We called support to get replacement strips (we were even willing to pay for them) and were told we had to buy a new attachment which costs over $100 and they refused to budge or offer any alternate solutions.Also, the attachment holder doesn't stay on the wand or hold the pieces very well. As a result, I'm constantly running around the house trying to find pieces when I need them.Finally, the cord retractor has weakened over time and doesn't work as well - we've only owned it for a little over a year.Other than that, it performs reasonably well, but don't gamble your money on a flimsy product the manufacturer won't stand behind."
5,Electrolux Harmony Vacuum,"We have owned this vacuum for 3 years and it has performed to great satisfaction with no problems whatsoever. Absolutely recommended for homes with hardwood/linoleum/tile floors. We have no carpet, but the carpet attachment works well on area rugs. I would be concerned that it may not be the best choice for homes with many rooms with carpet, however. Note that we paid $255 (delivered) at time of purchase."
3,REALLY expensive replacement parts!!!,"I bought this vacuum about two years ago and lovedit, zero complaints. I have mostly hardwood and tile floors. I have a separate vacuum for the carpeted rooms, this vacuum does not work well on carpet. I also have horrible allergies, vacuuming always made me sick. The filtration on this is awesome, no allergy problems at all. I use the clinical bags.Thehard floor nozzle started coming apart, the metal on the bottom wore through and started scratching my floors. I called Electrolux to order a new one and they wanted $102.00 plus shipping. That is ridiculous, half the price of the vacuum for the new attachement. This vacuum is worthless to me without the nozzle though. Not sure what I am going to do with it."
4,"Silence, or almost, is golden",The relative lack of noise is great though my cleaning person prefers the old Electrolux with the power in the carpet cleaner nozzle.
1,Not worth it,"This vacuum is okay if you have tile or wood floors, and you don't have anything pea sized or larger to pick up. A broom would do a better job in my opinion. And forget trying to vacuum the carpet or even a throw rug. It's worthless. At least you don't have to stock up on extra bags, you won't need them with this machine, it doesn't pick up enough to fill one!"
5,great canister vacuum,"I love my new Electrolux. I have not had ANY problems with it. We have hw floors and a large rug in the living room, bedrm is carpet. The vacuum works great. Mind you, the ""turbo"" brush is not much of a turbo, most times I just use the regular floor piece, on the carpet setting. It works great, the bags, although small, are long lasting,I have not had to change mine yet. I've had this for about one month and use it about 3 times a week. We have 2 dogs and 3 cats. And a 2 year old daughter. My dogs shed a lot right now and we also have a lot of foot traffice so to speak. I have no complaints at all about this machine and can only recommend it. The price was all right as well in my opinion. It shipped within a couple of days and was easy to ""put together"" and I used it right away. It is very clean and light and easy to use. the attachments are good too, we have carpet on the stairs and I have no problems with this one."
3,Almost Good,"I have had the Harmony for a year and it lives up to expectations EXCEPT for one big issue and that is the attachments which are cheaply made:1. The telescoping tube does not always lock into place.2. The turbo nozzle and carpet/hard floor nozzles are very difficult to remove. The latching mechanism is poorly designed and again cheap.3. The combo up upholstery nozzle/brush has the opposite issue. They do not latch in at all and when in use, continually fall off.Other than these mechanical issues the machine work great for cleaning, mobility and it is quiet."
5,Great Detergent,I have been using this detergent for over 3 years now. Still as good as ever! Great supplier.
4,Pricy but worth it,This is the best laundry soap in existence. I use about 1-2 tsp per load in my smallish machine. Astonishing what it gets out. Just wish it was cheaper.
5,One of the best of the eighties,"I'm surprised how strong this group is as far as staying power and the ability to produce a quality product. it seems impossible that 5-men can remain in the same band for long with the egos. This band also burned out however before they did they made some of the best music of the eighties and this is no exception.The strong vocals, instruementation this group has a strong sense of the music they wanted to create and they work as a very strong outfit. Each component from the back beat, rythym section, saxes and vocals they all fit in their place.A few examples ""I'll fly to You"", ""Only when you leave"", ""Nature of the Beast"" almost all the numbers should have charted.This group it hard not like any of their albums."
3,Novelty item,It seems kind of strange to buy something that's freely available online. I bought it as something of a souvenir. The production is nice. The bonus materials are nothing special.
1,Bad,"I don't care if ""Brother"" Haggard moves the hearts of every man in the world, I listened to this CD once and I probably won't again. I bought it because I am a huge Merle Haggard fan, and I thought maybe Marty had something to offer. Maybe he did, but this isn't it.Noel Haggard's ""One Lifetime"" is a much better listen if you want to hear something by one of Merle's kids."
5,Good worship sounds,"We have thoroughly enjoyed this CD...although some of the songs are common almost worn out praise and worship songs, PCD offers a fresh sound and transports you to the presence of GOD."
4,A good buy,"This CD consists of mostly familiar songs. On the whole, makes for soothing, familiar and comfortable listening. I felt as if I could hear the worship and the passion in the voices of Philips Craig and Dean. Their voices are clear yet comforting and worshipful as well. This is the first time I'm listening to this group and I'd say I'm a ""fan"" now."
1,received wrong CD,"I ordered Let My Words Be Few and received Lifeline. CD is in the wrong case. too bad, I was really looking forward to it..."
3,...,"... A) I have seen Caphalon Contenporary NS products in Target stores in Texas. B) I bought a large frying pan to try this set out. It definitely had paint -- or something very akin to it -- on the underside of the edge of the glass lid. And it started to come off after a couple of uses -- flakes of which landed up in the food. I peeled the rest off and it seems to be okay without it. The clerk in the store where I bought it (not Target) told me it was dishwasher safe, so I put it in the dishwasher. It seems to be surviving okay -- still pretty non-stick after a few months of use. All-in-all it is an ok pot, but I'm not sure I'll buy any more. C) I have tried to call Caphalon Customer Support a few times and have never gotten through their wait list (I hang up after about 10 minutes on hold). So it's not too world class as far as I am concerned."
1,I've eaten better teflon!!,"I cant believe anyone would rate these overpriced, overweight no-stick pots and pans more than a 1 star. I boil water in the 2 1/2 qt. one for pasta, that's all i use it for. I just noticed that all the no stick at the edge all the way around, is gone. I hand wash only. Dollar store cookware is better than this garbage product."
2,bent lids,One of the lids i received was vent very badly making the lid unusable since it didn't hold the heat in and it seemed as if my package was purchased returned and sold again to me rather disappointing since i spent so much on the cookware set!
3,Bad shipping one of the items is damaged.,"I ordered this product due to my past experience and coworkers recommendations, however when I received the box it was twice the size of the package and had been beat to pieces. The largest frying pan was damaged on three places on the lip of the frying pan. The damage is seriously enough to prevent the lid from making a seal or having gaps. Other than this the other pots and pans have minor marks from the box sliding around in the packaging box. I would really like to give this a 5 but I will see what will be done to fix the large Frying Pan/Skillet."
5,Calphalon Contemporary Nonstick 10-Piece Cookware Set,"This was a gift to my son, and not being a Chef, I figured he needs all the help he can get and bought him the best... Calphalon starter, NONSTICK set, which will serve him well"
3,Loved them while they lasted,"I bought this set straight out of college and loved them. The pans cooked well and cleaned easily. However, even after following all care instructions and using only nylon tools, the pans all began to peel after 6 years. That may be the price you pay for the eqse of non-stick, but I went with stainless for my new set. The idea of eating teflon flakes was just too upsetting."
1,Completely dissapointed,"We purchased this set less than a month ago. Our pans started to show discoloration around the outside. When I researched and inquired this issue with Calphalon Warranty I was informed that this was due to washing them in the dishwasher despite the pamphlet insert which came with the product clearly states ""Calphalon Unison is 100% dishwasher safe"". The customer service in my experience is less than stellar. I will NEVER purchase another set from Calphalon after this experience and would say I am completely dissatisfied with their false care directions and refusal to resolve this issue."
1,"Loved it at first, but now HATE it!!!","When replacing my cookware several years ago I decided to spend the extra money for this brand/style because of it's excellent reputation as being durable. Initially I LOVED the cookware. Lids fit well, heated evenly, nothing stuck to the surface. After about a year, despite following all care instructions, the non-stick surfaces stopped working. Thinking I just got a defective set, I sent it back to Caphlon. No problem with the return, they replaced the pieces without hesitation. Almost a year later that set too had the same sticking issues. The skillet I have sent back several times.I'm tired of paying shipping and dealing with the hassle of replacement. I'm not alone in my complaints. A neighbor has the same cookware and the same issues. We are both in search of new cookware. I'm not sure what it's going to be yet, but it will definitley not be Caphalon!"
4,Cats went nuts for them,"After getting over their initial suspicion of the new food treat, my cats wanted more, more, more! I was even suspicious at first because the treats seemed awfully hard. But once in kitty's mouth, the nibblet moistens a little and the cats just crunch away."
5,grrreat DVD,"I absolutely love this! No tellin' how many times I've watched it and I've had it for some time. Trust me, this is an awesome DVD, even if you haven't seen him in concert. I've seen him twice, and it just gets better and better."
4,Michael W. Smith - Live in Concert: A 20 Year Celebration,"A very good dvd in which michael does a number of his popular songs. Add to that a special appearance by Amy Grant and the video for Signs plus the making of the video for ""Signs"" as well as some still photos and you have a very good dvd. Song list included ""Place In This World"" ""I Will Be Here For You"" and they were done as a medley and only with piano which was disappointing as those are two songs that so many people relate with. If you are a fan of Michael W. Smith and like the ""live"" atmosphere of a dvd concert then this is a dvd that is worth having."
1,A Very Poor Biography,"Superficial, scattered with an odd smattering of references, this is one of the worst biographies that I have ever read. Ted Hughes deserves better."
1,How Not to Write a Biography,"This is an extremely shallow book. It is riddled with errors. Although it paints Ted Hughes in a very pleasant light, it does not give the reader the slightest idea of what the man was really like. I was very disappointed by this book."
1,Horrible!,"Elaine Feinstein obviously didn't have access to many sources for this VERY poor biography. Sylvia Plath certainly cast a huge shadow over Hughes' life, but we get very little insight into the Hughes-Plath marriage from Hughes' perspective. Feinstein doesn't know how to write biography--a difficult art form for anyone who isn't willing to hurt feelings or take criticism. Feinstein didn't want to annoy ANYONE with her lame book. Dates are given incorrectly and names are misspelled to the point at which I wonder exactly how much attention the author was giving to her sloppy manuscript, and how quickly she felt she needed to get it published before somebody else decided to cover the subject of Hughes in a thorough, responsible fashion. Don't waste your money on this book. Check it out of the library if you must, but don't buy it!"
3,"A biography of Plath, then Hughes","This book, though well written, contains far too much information on Plath. True, we must understand Plath to get at Hughes, but the book seems to be telling the chapters on Plath from her point of view. I would like to see a biography of Hughes from solely his point of view b/c he deserves that."
3,not the best,"This is the textbook I was required to buy; but because of its sloppy content, I was compelled to buy other books. This may be also due to the fact that my professor is inadequate. However, if you are like me and take responsibility for your learning, consider Linear Algebra by Larson. I bought an older edition for almost nothing. It is so much more thorough and clear."
5,"Incredible depiction of the whole, interconnected earth!","I saw this while on an island in the pacific and felt closer to the rest of the world while simultaneously a speck in the ocean, ""drop in the bucket"", and gald I was not an ""ant of the city"" or worse, the ""army"".... Nevertheless happy to enjoy an insignificant, wonderful life fully aware of how far we have come, and how we can only change our tiny portion. Awesome!!!"
4,eye candy for the soul,an amazingly deft collage of scenery and agile cinematography that takes you through all extremes of our planet. excellent scenes include group mediation rituals and time lapse scenes in modern cities as well as an excellent score. the variety and scope is ambitious.
5,Mind Expanding...,"...The film is mind expanding; making one see how interconnected we all are and how our communal, global greed erodes away our human dignity! Time has truly become of the essence if we want to save our planet and maybe even mankind ."
3,Angst-Ridden Humanity in a Mechanized World,"This film starts with some great scenes of nature and indigenous societies. But one of the main themes is the meaninglessness of modern, technological society. Scenes of baby chicks being sped along are juxtaposed with scenes of commuters rushing to and fro. Yes, we know the modern world is often inhuman. While this is a perceptive film, it's not really an upper. It also is one-sided in its appreciation of humanity connected to nature, as if nature is itself without a dark side.Naive primitivism is not an answer to technological angst.There are some good time-lapse clips, but overall the film did not, for me, live up to many of the superlative reviews. I was questioning whether I should buy this, and would have appreciated more critical reviews."
1,Baraka Blu-Ray Freezes on Samsung BD-P2550,"From reading various posts on other sites, it appears that there is a known problem with this Blu-Ray title. I don't know if it is a bad batch of discs or what. When I play the disc on my Samsung BD-P2550 with the latest firmware as of 1/19/2009, it freezes in Ch 18 in the scene showing the Egyptian ruins. I am unable to move forward and get the player to continue. I have to return to the menu and then select Ch 20 to be able to get past the problem. I requested a replacement from Amazon and received it. The replacement does the same thing. I don't know whether to return it again or not.Other that that, I love this disc. The cinematography is beautiful. I would give it 5 stars instead of 1 if I could get this issue resolved."
2,Koyaanisqatsi wannabe...,"Sorry, but I see this film not as a unique new view of the world, nor a unique way of filming the world, making a statement, etc.This is really just a Koyaanisqatsi/Powasqatsi wannabe.The film looks like it was made in the same locations, many of the camera angles are the same, even the dump scenes are virtually identical. True there are some very unique perspectives, but overall the degree of similarity makes this very nearly plagaristic.Do yourself a favor. Buy Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi. Rent Baraka if you want to see it, but save your $$ for the ""real McCoy."""
1,So close yet so far,"Beware of the small print.I read the reviews, read the technical specs regarding the scanning sample rates and was blinded by the hype.Went out and paid for it to be delivered 9000 miles to me.Put it in my region A PS3, sat down with great expectations and was presented with a message that imformed me that the DRM region was not compatable with my player. First time ever this has happened to me.Now hunting for a Region A player and can now say to all - ""read the fine print"" with regards to region playability.Upon actually getting to experince the disc I will revise my rating accordingly."
2,not for everyone,"This is actually a five star film in terms of the quality of the production. The only way I can describe it as sort of like an extremely well done National Geographic special without any narration and with an excellent soundtrack. Why do I give it 2 stars then? Because of the disgusting scenes of animal torture involving live little chicks (as in baby chickens). I never got past these scenes which the director seems to fixate on. It mars an otherwise beautiful movie. Animal lovers beware, you will hurl this dvd across the room in disgust as I did. It's too bad, its otherwise very good..."
3,visually stimulating,"Not a single word is spoken throughout the entire movie; the images speak for themselves. There is lots of visuals to feast your eyes on. It will remind you how good one has it living in America in the 21st century. The movie doesn't preach or make extensive criticisms - just shows what was observed with a 77-mm lens. Often, the settings are confusing and refernces get lost on the general public, and one almost wishes that there was an explanatory audio track to along with this documentary (there might be on the DVD of this film, but I saw this movie in theaters)."
5,"Stunning, unforgettable experience","I first got BARAKA many years ago, this is one of my all time favorites, some people don't understand it, thats ok, it is a journey, what we are, what the world is, AMAZING!"
5,Awesome,This is an awesome film. Everyone should see it and also get the 2 disc set so you can find out how everything was done
1,REVIEW OF MIAMI MERCHANDISE,"I did not receive the movie Baraka. It took 5 weeks and an email asking where it was to alert me that Miami Merchandising did not ship my order, or was no longer selling the movie."
2,Region 1 beware,beware. this is region 1 coded and will not play outside the contintntal USA.This information was not available on the Amazon website when I purchased the blu ray.Makes a nice paperweight though.Bill RinerBrisbaneAustralia
4,Baraka - A Silent Videographic Movie about Life and Humanity,"The movie ""Baraka"" is a spectacular video documentary that chronicles life, the earth, and humanity. It is also a silent movie that creatively uses HD cinematography to visually portrayBaraka [Blu-ray] the connectivity of all of the world's major religions, cultures, and landscapes; furthermore, it cleverly portrays some of the modern global challenges resulting from our ever-increasing human population. In a unique and visually enthralling manner it causes viewers to more deeply contemplate the oneness of life, earth, and humanity. In my opinion, The Baraka movie is a wonderful video documentary worthy of being added to anyone's home theatre movie collection!"
5,A Truly Moving Film,"This film was truly moving and had all the things that are signifigant (and needed)for all life. This film showed nature, religion, and civilization-the basis of which our whole world was formed. This was a truly moving film and I reccommend that everyone who can see it go see it. Keep some tissues handy, too!"
3,"Great Movie, Mediocre DVD","Baraka is a wonderful, entrancing movie, full of rich images which hold your attention. A friend (who had not seen the movie) said: ""You just can't take your eyes away, can you?"" That being said, I thought the DVD image transfer was not much better than the VHS version and the promised ""letterbox version"" was a lie - you only get the 4:3 version. The sound is Dolby Digital - excellent! The movie gets an A+; the DVD gets a C."
4,Christmas gift,"Thank you for the speedy delivery.I initially thought I could not play the DVD but after purchasing a new player,the DVD is now playing.I didn't realise there were regional codes across different countries and was disappointed not to be able to view DVD at Christmas but problem is now resolved."
5,Spectacular and visually stunning,"This DVD makes you really appreciate the planet we live on both in a beautiful and sometimes sad way. It is shot in a way that is truly spectacular similar to the Planet Earth series, yet there are no spoken words just beautiful music and sounds.If you want a DVD that will help you appreciate the world you live in and the many different cultures, this will truly inspire you to learn more. This is one of the most amazing videos I have ever seen."
5,Summary of humanity,I agree very much with the reviewer who wrote that it is hard to review this movie without sounding cliche or naive. Baraka is truly a unique movie and you should go out and see it.
5,Visual Poetry,"Think of poetry and it's relationship to language as the most potent, expressive use of language. Now, change the word 'poetry' to Baraka and 'language' to film.Baraka is a daring, beautiful, heartbreaking meditation on the separateness and sameness of people. It's a vision of the grandeur of nature, the depth of spirit and worship, the assembly line feeling of urban life.By all means watch this film, let it take you where it goes and your mind will be full."
1,Beautiful movie but skips,"I love this movie but, from the first time I played it, my blu-ray copy skipped starting around 1:10 mins in. The disk does not appear to have any dirt or scratches and careful cleaning does not help. I suspected a hardware/firmware issue until I did a web search and found that many others are having identical issues. I am disappointed to have to return my copy. I am using an Oppo BDP-83 with the latest firmware."
3,Global Images of Life and Death,"""Baraka"" is essentially a series of images from around the world set to ambient sounds/music. Myself, I enjoyed the fast-motion, rat-raced city scenes and their symbolism; also some of the nature scenes from the Galapagos Islands and elsewhere. But much of the rest of it I found to be strange and even creepy.Be aware that you need to be in the mood for this sort of thing; ""Baraka"" is not suitable for casual slap-dash viewing. I don't know anything about cinematographer/director Ron Fricke or what his trip is, or whether he indulges in ""controlled substances"" and the like. And I'm not suggesting that the viewer do likewise; only that one needs to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy this. PS I'm referring to the VHS version, so I can't address the features on the DVD."
3,Impenetrable,"I have to say that I was totally lost when I watched this documentary bearing a fame of ultimate picture quality. Without even a single piece of lyrics or narrative, how could one possibily understand whats going on with those people doing weird things (worshiping or sth like)??I am not quite into it."
3,Decent Eye-Candy,"Friends kept hammering me with this as a recommendation and frankly, I just watched it without reading a thing about it.Certainly well-produced visually, but I found myself feeling like I was grazing through video clips from the Getty image library. The documentary guy in me was frustrated without just a little context to go with the visuals. I dunno. Roll one up and watch this I guess but I found myself doing other things and glancing occasionally after about the first hour. Still, I suppose it's better than sticking a fork in your eye. For my time, I'd rather watch Planet Earth (ANY of them)."
3,great movie with bad tunes,"The movie is wonderful, melting many cultures and places into one wonderful movie. The drawback is that the music background leaves you a little wanting. Maybe the music did not come through well when recording. It seems like it is a vibration that becomes somewhat hard to handle at times. I use the film to teach teenagers in homeschool ""mental mapping"". It works very well for that."
5,Brilliant,"This is a masterpiece. Superb music, breathtaking photography and beautifully captured scenes. I can't praise this film enough. Don't waste your money on Koyaanisqatsi/Powaqqatsi. Baraka puts these to shame."
5,Amazing,I have watched this masterpiece 20 or more times on a regular dvd. I was amazed to watch it in Blu-ray. You percieve a greater depth of meaning through the clarity of the video.
5,stunning visual feast!,"Baraka really has to be experienced. It is not a conventional film in any aspect, as there are no spoken words, no plot, no special affects but a visual and cultural spin around the globe with absolutley stunning visuals and highly effective sounds. I like to watch it every so often and I still get amazed by it. Ron Fricke has done an astounding job at making us realize that in every part of Planet Earth we are all connected by this living experience. We are all connected to life. So watch and draw your own conclusions."
5,A non-verbal trip through magical (and utterly real) times and places.,"A great cinematic voyage to a fantastic world that is, in fact, our own earth, seen anew."
5,"Wonderful , touching film",I highly recommend this film! It is a beautiful video storybook telling stories of places all over the world past and present.
5,Stranger in a strange land,"I did like it how one of us said here that this is a film made by a director who is, although very talented, an alien.There is this unhuman impartiality in the film that allows a lot of us to see it not as a message, but as a collection of unrelated beautiful and disturbing (to us) images, all of which try to paint for the alien traveler a picture of our world as inclusive as possible.This view of life on Earth through an alien's eyes is somewhat distressing - it seems so objective. This film shows that nature does not understand, does not accept human definitions of right or wrong, ugly or beautiful, and it makes us wonder how much our individual lives and our individual values are really worth."
2,What a pity!,"I saw it in the theatre and bought the laser disc version. It is a movie that can be watched repeatedly, usually with friends. You can imagine my great disappointment in having to return my Christmas present - the DVD version of the film - to the place of purchase because of its poor quality. It is unsharp, excessively high in contrast and low in color saturation. What is more, the image flickers in certain scenes, especially those of skyscapes, giving one the impression that they had been shot through the rotating blades of a helicopter. This must be one of the rare instances where the DVD is inferior to the laser disc.This is a great pity, for it is a film that will continue to entrall, surprise, amaze, sadden, etc for a long time to come.I will purchase it when a new remastering becomes available."
3,content VS style,"Like most reviewers here, I liked the film for its beauty,and obviously the effort that has gone into each frame. But if we still believe in the content VS style debate, the message that the movie conveys is something that I dont agree with. The glorification of tribal over city life with cityfolk compared to mechanical assembly line productions and hapless chickens, whereas tribalfolk are full of energy and celebration. Havnt we overgrown this simplistic binary yet? The linear progression of serene forest-cold factory-lifeless cemetries-bombs etc etc. could have been rethought."
5,The language of Film,"It is truly amazing to find a handcrafted work of art that guides you, without using concepts and words, into your own world in two hours of fascinating journey.The music, the rythm, the photography, the whole MEANING of it all is memerizing.Guys, this DVD is truly an eye opener, I think you'll look at the world differently after this experience."
3,"Uneven. At times brilliant, at times boring. Needs editing!","The very high rating given this DVD sold me on it. I wish I had not bought it. It is over-rated, I think.The film needs editing down to 1:20 or less. It had beauty and striking composition and often effective music/video coordination and then ... strangely, is unecessarily repetitive. The star-transit scenes especially just don't work. I mean, how many times do we need to see the great arch at Arches National Monument? It was featured maybe 10 times! Or it seemed so.The film was a good idea, not realized. And a good many scenes are repeated twice, three times, even. Once was plenty.I might feel I'd gotten my money's worth if I'd rented this DVD. Maybe. It's a close call. I am disappointed to have bought it. It is not finished! It is obviously giving us many strong messages but not, I fear, terribly effectively."
2,its Okay,Probably the most overrated Blu-ray on Amazon. Watched this 1 time. I also have the Planet Earth Blu-ray which I think is much better and watch frequently on my high-end home theater system.If you want to purchase this watch for used as I will be selling my copy here.
1,Freezes on Sony Blue-ray player,"Really disapointing. This is the third time I bought Baraka movie! first VHS format on 96, than DVD and now Blue-ray format. I was one of the first to receive, I believe, because I have pre-ordered on Amazon. Came with problem, and I have returned, than received another copy. But same problem, in my opinion think this problem was spread out on the very first release, so better to wait a couple more months to get a better release. Don't buy now."
1,Horrible packaging!,"Normally I would review a movie in this spot but sadly, I never got the chance.The first copy showed up scratched. It was so damaged that it didn't work in my player. Amazon overnighted me a replacement and that disc was also scratched/not working.Amazon can't replace a replacement so I ended up getting a refund.100% recycleable packaging is a great idea in concept but without adequate protection for the disc, it does more harm than good. MPI ""are still testing this issue"" but I imagine that the return rate must be high. Enough that dud discs outweigh the benefit of recycleable packaging.I ended up having to import this Blu-Ray from the UK to get a copy with a real case. Hopefully, I'll be able to update this review with a review of the movie itself when I recieve it.-update The UK release is region locked B"
3,disturbing,"I can't get the awful images from this documentary out of my mind. At first it was a wonderful documentary- no words, just images and moody music. Images of fascinating things around the world that you wouldn't normally see yourself, such as religious ceremonies in far away places. But then it started to show really disgusting things- like cute little baby chicks being abused on an assembly line, and then some man with very ill-looking eyes making horrific faces, perhaps having a seizure. At that point I decided it was not ok for my child to see and turned it off. I can't stop thinking about those poor little chicks. Definitely glad I only eat organic eggs. I guess that's what the point of the documentary was. But I was expecting beautiful images."
3,"bad, bad image quality","Unbelievable movie, unbelievably poor encoding. It's like they recorded it off a dodgy reel... stratches, dust, desaturated colours. Ill, ill, ill, shame, shame, shame, ill."
1,Locks Up Sony 350 w/v.10 firmware,"What I saw of it was wonderful, but locks up and would barely load.You can take your chances if you like, but there are other similar reviews.My copy is going back.Update: Some have installed firmware v13 and reported that Baraka plays properly, but I have not yet seen an official release of v13 on the sony firmware download page."
4,Exquisite cinematography,"This is my first experience with this genre of movies. The images are absolutely gorgeous in detail and composition. I do wish that locations of the different scenes were identified. For many scenes, I could only speculate as to where they had been filmed."
4,interesting photos,"excellant photogreaphy, depicts life around the world thru photos.Would recommend this movie to those who appreciate good photography, but not for the average person looking for a movie."
5,Watch Me!,"I had watched this DVD before, but not in the special two-disc edition. It was beautiful and the picture quality was great!"
2,Sealing rings don't last very long,"I keep having to replace the rings every 6 months because they shrink and then they don't do their job. I have a Presto canner and if there was a better ring that fits (which I don't think there is) I would get it. My friend has a Mirro canner and she used it for 15 years and never had to replace the ring. I wish the Mirro ring fit into my Presto canner, but it doesn't."
3,Overrated,"Good, but not the greatest Stones album. It's been overhyped by everyone. Good documentary has been made about the making of this record."
1,Great Item-TERRIBLE Packing,"BOTH Vinly LP's were warped MORE than ANY I've ever seen in my 48 YEARS of purchasing Vinyl. Basically the Shrink Wrap used to enclose this double LP set was MUCH too tight, causing the warpage."
5,Great Stones Album,This is a great Stones album and one of the best albums of all time. This is the ultimate blues rock. It's one of the best Stones albums along with Let It Bleed and Sticky Fingers.
2,Bad remix,"The sound is too bright. Hard to listen to with high-end speakers or good headphones. Lots of detail -- individual instruments can be heard clearly -- but bassy, rolled-off speakers or earbuds are a must. Not recommended for good ears or good equipment. (But then, the original wasn't great on high-end equipment either.)"
2,not very good,"I wanted to buy a Rolling stones'cd but I didn't know wich one, so I've bought this one because it's supposed to be their greatest album.I don't agree with that. It's a kind of boring. I'm never able to listen all the cd 'cause I fell asleep before the end. If it's really their greatest album, it's too bad!"
1,I want to play it were I want to play it,"After finding out that it wouldn't play on 6 different computers in the office in my car CD player and in the clock radio on my desk, I contacted to manufacturer that said it is not supposed to play on computers or some older CD players and it is the way it is and no they will not send me one that will! Really ruined the whole experience of hearing this CD again:("
3,I don;t think it's good,"cuz some songs in formal studio version lost some oringinal feelinglike shine alight,all down the line, loving cuptheir demo version sounds much better than the one on exilethis 2lp contains some classicbut not perfect stones album at all!(cuz too separated,not has a total theme)"
2,"Good music, but sadly compressed","This is a classic Stones collection, of course, but I wouldn't recommend this particular version, ""re-mastered"" as it is. The material is overly processed to keep the volume constant throughout and as a result it is NOT a pleasure to listen to. This has been already pointed out by others; I should have noticed."
5,Boring?,"Decidedly NOT boring; maybe you had to be around when it first came out. Covers the whole gamut of rock influences, from gospel to boogie-woogie to hard rock much better than U2 did on ""Rattle and Hum"" or anyone else has ever done in a similar project. A true document of the history of rock 'n' roll, performed by true students and masters of the artform and its roots. Quite possibly the greatest rock record of all time. Dig."
2,Awful Remaster,"I wish I had read the bad reviews about this product before buying it. Sadly, it's another victim of the Loudness War."
3,"It's true, I don't think it's great","Well, you may think that I am crazy, but I am not. I love classic rock, Hendrix, Beatles and all that stuff. I like the Stones too, but I can't enjoy this record! Yeah, Keith plays great, it has good songs, it's bluesy, powerful, but something in it is wrong. I don't like the mix. The voices, the instruments, the sounds are a mess. So, every time i sit and say: ""ok, this time I will enjoy"", I feel very uncomfortable, having the feeling that something's not working. I put three stars only because I recognize that is classic."
3,Disappointing -- could have been a classy classic,"The (vinyl) LP mix is excellent, as is the disc mastering. The CD's however, are over-compressed. While this makes them sound louder and heavier at first, it makes them tedious to listen to all the way through.The DVD is OK, but it's not the complete film -- I'm not sure what was left out, and maybe it's not worth including, but for the price being charged here, it seems that buyers should be able to decide that -- and fast forward through what they don't like.But what really seems to be a cheat here is that there are only 4 of the original 12 post cards ... what's the story?Go find the old original 2-LP set with the 12 post cards, and then just get the individual components of this 2010 package when they're on sale at your favorite music vendors. It will probably cost you less, and the sum of the parts will be greater."
1,A terrible reissue..,Anyone who thinks this remastering is an improvement over Bob Ludwig's 1994 version for Virgin should not be commenting on the sound of anything. This remastering has been terribly compressed. The life has been sucked out of it. It's been made small and stupid and someone here has actually posted the measurements proving what those of us who listen for a living immediately heard.There's no excuse for what was done here. Find yourself the older version or better yet the original vinyl and get to know what good is.
2,What a HUGE disappointment.,"I've been eagerly awaiting this re-release since it was first announced, and my worst fears are realized. With the highly overrated Don Was at the helm I knew this would happen. It is so hyper-compressed and limited it sounds like holy CRAP! A full 8dB louder than the original CD release, vocals are pushed back in the mix, horn parts are barely audible, all of the traits of an over-mastered album. Granted the original CD was strident in the upper midrange, but you could compensate with a touch of eq around 3k or so. This, you can do nothing with. I only give this two stars because the album is so great even Don Was can't completely screw it up."
5,Excellent! Really a worth buying!,"PLEAS, DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND BUY THIS MASTERPIECE! PROBABLY THE BEST ALBUM OF ALL-TIME! NEVER EVER BUY NEVERMIND FROM NIRNAVA, BECAUSE IT IS HORRIBLE! THIS IS THE ONE FOR WHO DO LOVE ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC! THE BEST! ""TUMBLIG DICE"" IS ONE OF THE BEST SONGS EVER WRITTEN! ""RIP THIS JOINT"", ""ROCKS OFF"", ""HAPPY"" ARE AWESOME AND MIND BLOWING!"
2,Live in Concert With Mick Taylor! and the Return Of Bill Wyman! Watch And See!,This is all being set up for a possible world tour featuring Bill Wyman on bass and Mick Taylor on guitar watch and see if this dosent happen! everyone will pay for that one! and that's how they are going to go out!
3,Exile On Main Street.,"No slick production Exile OnMain Street hit the shops in 1972 and was hailed by critics as Their most mature and ambitious album to date. Recorded in Keith Richard basement in France and with his wonderful masterful guitar skills and amazing piano's , horns and voice of Mick Jagger they created this album that has become one of the most loved album in rock n'roll history.I must confess I did not enjoy this album that much. The songs I Liked was Rocks Off, Rip This Joint, Shake Your Hips, Casino Boogie, Tumbling Dice, Sweet Virginia, Torn And Frayed, Happy, Let It Loose, Stop Breaking Down, Shine A Light and Soul Survivior. Though that is a lot. The album does not work as a whole. Though every song is well craftet, well played and thoughtful and the arrangements are good. It seems that they did this album way to fast. Even though supposed to be shoddy they should have worked more on the songwriting or instead release a single album."
3,"GET A GRIP,THIS IS NOT A ROCK MASTERPIECE!","COMPARING THIS TO WHAT HAS COME FROM THE STONES AFTER THIS,YES, THIS ALBUM HAS IT'S HIGH MOMENTS, BUT SORRY, IT'S NOT THE BEATLES WHITE ALBUM,NOR IS IT LED ZEP VOLUME IV, OR PINK FLOYD DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. THE GOOD MOMENTS ARE TUMBLING DICE, HAPPY,SOUL SURVIVOR,AND ROCKS OFF. THE WORST IS SHAKE YOUR HIPS, TURD ON THE RUN,(SAY WHAT?)I JUST WANT TO SEE HIS FACE,AND SWEET VIRGINIA,SUNG HEE HAW STYLE. THE REST FLOATS BETWEEN OKAY TO JUST SO-SO. AT THIS POINT THEY STILL HAD SOME GAS IN THE ENGINE,BUT THIS SHOULD HAVE COME OUT AS A SINGLE ALBUM,IT'S JUST TO INCONSISTENT TO CALL A ROCK MASTERPIECE."
1,Bought it and Regret It.,"Yeah, I bought it, tried listening to it but couldn't. It had only two hit songs on it and the was filler in my opinion. Very country like type music but nothing that really grabs you. I'm sorry I bought it."
1,I've had the lp for years. It's still in new condition.,I do not understand the enthusiasm for this collection of crappy tunes. This is The Stones at their worst. Skip it.
1,strictly for the converted,"this album probABLY is the bomb for people whom like draggy ""blues"" masterpieces. while this album may fuse different styles and the guitar work is skillful....it's just a complete waste of time as 80% of the album sounds the same,a part from rocks off and the overrated tumbling dice, the album just rambles on and on. the songs are paced at a drone and really....it's not exactly fantastic or what the stones are really capable of. this is when the stones lost whatever flash they had and became *sigh* a ""blues"" band. it's exactly what the black album is for metallica,manic rock and roll geniuses slowing the pace down...just like metallica, they would never produce anything great after this monotonous low."
1,Hip Hop On Main St,"Mick Jagger has been listening to hip hop too long, for it has crept into ""Dancing In The Light"" one of the songs that he has added new vocals to. I guess that because the song had no vacals and there for no melody, Mick just went in and sung what ever melody came to mind, which in this case was more of a hip hop rhythm than an actual melody. I don't know whether to laugh or cry.In order to get this review on here I had to give it a rating of at least one star, however it should really be minus 5 stars."
1,Overrated garage music,"Any backyard garage band could probably have recorded this and done a better job.Unprofessional poorly recorded,murky,no tunes,non-existant production,need I say more!If you want an album that a bunch of 16 year old novices could have bettered than get this by all means.Would have been better with more tunes and glossier production tecniques.Save your money and buy Abbey Road instead."
3,Most Overrated Stones Album,"I'll probably be killed for writing this, but honestly, this is the most overrated Stones Album. I'm amiss as to where people got the idea that this album is the best album, or at least one of the best albums, the Stone ever put out. Really, it's just okay, nothing more. Listen to Exile again, then listen to the two best albums the Stones put out. #1) Let It Bleed; #2) Beggars Banquet. Everything else seems kind of sad after those two, especially Exile. So, skip Exile and go straight to Let it Bleed and Beggars Banquent--not only the two best Stones albums, but also two of the best rock albums ever put out."
5,Back in Exile,"I wasn't around when The Stones originally released Exile, but after listening to the ""lost"" tracks, I can only imagine what it must have been like when Exile was first released. My favorite song on the 2nd disc is Plundered My Soul (...I thought you wanted my money, but you plundered my soul...).I only wish there were more tracks on the 2nd disc."
2,I'll take Sticky Fingers and Beggar's Banquet,"Although every full-on full-tilt Stones fan I know digs this as their favorite Stones LP, I could never get with this album, and Lord knows I've tried. That said, Tumblin' Dice is one of the great Stones songs. But too many songs hit one groove, and STAY THERE. There is pretty much nothing in the way of dynamics for many of the tunes. A lot of the imagery is pretty gross - and I usually dig the outlandishness of the boys. But here it just feels lazy and...pointless. None of the righteous ridiculousness of Shattered, and none of the ragged beauty of Wild Horses. I know people love this album in a very protective way, like they do their little brother. I ain't got a brother and I don't love this album."
5,"Hey Mick and Keith, get a new bass player!!","Let's be frank. I have nothing against Darryl Jones, he's a great bass player. But you just listen to ""Plundered My Soul"" featuring Bill Wyman. Isn't it the best Stones single in years? This is 100% Rolling Stones. It's easy to understand why people is buying this great album a lot.So my suggestion is, the Stones should find a more 'bluesy' and 'warm' bass player, more close the the roots of the group.A funky bassist is OK, but it makes the Stones sound cold."
2,exiled on saint charles,I was very disappointed in the CD. It does not contain the original albums complete listing of titles and did not forewarn of said lack.
4,"Vey good, but not great",This is overall a very good album but too many songs sound like fillers to me.
3,Overrated,"Exile On Main St. is way over-hyped. It's really not that great. Sticky Fingers is a much better Stones album. This is a good album, don't get me wrong, but in no way deserving of the praise that's heaped on it. The songs are mostly forgettable, unlike Sticky Fingers which has several great, memorable songs. If you want to hear a truly great rock album, though, check out the Beatles' White Album."
3,"It was the Right Time, Right Place","IF {and it's a very big IF} you had been in your early twenties in 1972 then it was very likely (like me) you had been broke. I got some balance of my three-figure salary and bought the double album. I liked everything about the album ....nostalgia kind of black and white LP cover....and the best songs are Tumbling Dice (superb Charlie Watts drum ending) and Sweet Virginia ... AND it was the right time...Beatles had just splat....If you had this on the record player then you'd also be ready to turn on Santana Abraxas...and John Lennon's Imagine...and Elton John...and Dylan's New Morning.... for many, the world was new in 1972. Buy this super deluxe edition, people, fore keepsake... if you can spare a bit out of your pension funds..."
5,Buy Exile and Sticky Fingers Now,This album is a slow burn. It was the second helping that really hooked me. Sticky Fingers and Exile. Rock and Roll can not be better than this.
5,Robert Johnson would have approved,"Robert Johnson was the greatest bluesman of all time. The Rolling Stones had the audacity to take his masterpiece ""Stop Breaking Down,"" and turn it around and upside down and make it into an even greater song. This song is the centerpiece of the five songs that end this CD with the greatest flourish of any album in history: ""All Down the Lline,"" ""Let It Loose,"" ""Stop Breaking Down,"" ""Shine a Light,"" and ""Soul Survivor."" And the rest of the album's not bad either."
5,AMAZING!!!!,"I am rarely driven to write reviews but this album is an exception. I had all but forgotten about ""Exile"" until the hoopla of the past few days. Listening to it now, I see why it was one of my favourite albums way back when. As others have said, it is the album, the sum of all of its parts, that is great."
4,Get the 5-star single disc release!,"The original Exile LP, the now remastered version, is the one to get if you do not yet have this Stones classic. It is one of the great rock records of all time. The second disc of extras on this 2-disc deluxe is OK but in no way essential unless you must have each and every track the Stones released."
5,A Lesson in American Music,"What you have here is the Rolling Stones giving us back exactly what we had been missing right under our noses, and taking it to places that the creators never could have possibly imagined. Every element of pure American music is here and there isn't a sour note. From the smoke filled juke joints of the deep south, to the slick blues of Chicago's West Side, to a Texas roadhouse, to a gospel choir, right back to Chuck Berry, it's all here. Everything great about American music deconstructed and built back up to reach places never before imagined.This is music one could imagine spilling out into Beale Street in 1955 or shaking the rafters of a Mississippi blues hall or belting out of some Baptist church. It's what every Saturday night should sound like. No need to break down each song here. They all have their charms. Needless to say no music collection is complete without it, and if you don't get it, you don't get American music and you surely don't get Rock and Roll."
5,A smoke-filled basement bar at 3AM,"The funniest thing about this album is that it's hard to picture the Stones doing many takes of a song, or splitting hairs over production when recording this album. In fact, the whole thing sounds like an inspired, late-night jam-session. The Sixties were definitely over, the bar was closed, but in a murky basement somewhere, the Stones sounded like they hadn't stopped partying since. Rather than producing single, greatest-hits-type tunes, this album establishes an overall mood of inspired weariness. It takes a few listens, it but grows on you and stays there for a long time."
4,"Great Stones Album, but overrated","This is one of those items in pop culture that has gained a reputation as something that is supposed to be fantastic. You are supposed to love it, to think it is one of the greatest albums of all time. It always amazes me that people buy into these things.I am a HUGE Stones fan, and while I like this album, it is definitely not five stars. Even Mick Jagger has commented that he doesn't understand why people say it is such a great album. It has four or five really great songs on it, but it also has a lot of filler. Not good enough for a double album -- should have been a superb single album.If you want a true five star Stones album, get ""Sticky Fingers""."
2,The sound of White Soul,"Muddy Waters with gospel/Country Western - get a clue....Buy Muddy Waters chess compilation for the master and let the copycat Stones/Zep fans to their relics. Sorry, but I'm tired of Stones fans' Beatles inferiority complex that they constantly rip the ""studio albums"" - or try to measure up by comparing themseves to Chuck Berry (a bubblegum rocker who'd eat Keith for breakfast and you know it). Exile on Main Street deserves more than two stars, but I can't find it in my heart to give it... I'm tired of the classic rock fans holding on to unchalleging rewrites as high art. Punk came and went and classic rock (and it's 3rd eye/Santana/Dave Matthews/Sheryl Crow successors) still controls the airwaves (sigh). It's not our fault Stones/GNR/Eagles fans were born with a bad ear and little serious musical interest."
2,I don't get it,I know I'm supposed to like it but I don't. For me Muswell Hillbillies by the Kinks has it all over this CD.
2,A crude filler feast?,"I remember back in the summer of '72 buying two albums, Deep Purple's ""Machine Head"" and the Rolling Stones ""Exile on Main Street."" Well, to this day I still feel the same, Exile isn't nearly as good. Not even in the same league. Matter of fact, I don't think I played it much that summer at all, it was all Deep Purple.""Exile"" does have some bright spots, Rocks Off, Tumbling Dice, Sweet Virginia, Happy & All Down The Line, for example, but there's way too much filler. On the other hand, ""Machine Head"" had maybe one filler, but it was still very strong when compared to Exiles roster.Also, the production of Exile is also pretty rough which doesn't help when there is so much filler. I don't think Jagger even cares much for this effort. Overrated I think he said.With so many reviewers giving it ""5 stars,"" what's Machine Head then? 1O stars? Well, in fact it is!!!I'd pick up ""Exile on Main Street"" used."
2,Absurdly overrated,"The Rolling Stones' Exile On Mainstreet is the most absurdly overrated album in rock history. There is nothing overly special about this 1972 ""classic."" The Stones effectively pilfered the styles of BB King or Buddy Guy and repeated the process eighteen times. Some tracks such as ""Torn and Frayed,"" ""Tumbling Dice"" and ""Happy"" are fine on their own but the album as a whole falls flat, weighed down by a tedious repetition of murky, southern draws and generic, unexciting blues riffs. It is a decent album when compared to those of lower ranking British blues bands such as Ten Years After or Herman's Hermits but there are many more capable and radiant LPs in rock's arsenal deserving of Exile's rank in the classic album hierarchy."
1,Hey old people! Listen up!,"The Rolling Stones are garbage for old dorky hippies! Don't waste your money on this generic garbage. Listen to some awesome music like 50 Cent, Soulja Boy, Carrie Underwood or Green Day instead. You know why this band sucks? Besides every song sounding the same, they never got any MTV or BET airplay. What gives?!"
4,Good+,"No instant classics on the album but most of the songs are really good. For sure one of the best albums the stones have done. The only lacking song is ""Loving Cup"". Other than that it is the most consistent album that they have produced. ""Shake Your Hips"" is one of the best blues rock songs ever done. That song just cooks."
3,"Some good songs, some not so good.","'Exile on Main Street' has some really good songs, but other ones that are not so good. The album's highlights are 'Rocks Off', 'Thumbling Dice', 'Happy', and 'Loving Cup'. A decent mixuture of blues, country, and rock."
4,What a coincidence . . .,Has anyone noticed that Mick Taylor and Bill Wyman don't appear in any of the photos in the insert?
5,Nice package Mick!,"I bought the vinyl, Deluxe, and Super Deluxe packages. This boxed set is very well made and a beauty to hold on to. No need to review the album as we all know what a masterpiece that is. I assume the mastering of the CD in this kit matches that of the Deluxe which is mastered too loud. Hopefully the vinyl will sound better. The hard bound book in this set was a lot of fun to read and the pictures were really great. There are at least 3 pictures showing Mick Taylor who's virtuoso guitar playing on the album makes it what it is. The DVD is a short tease of what will hopefully be fully released someday (i.e. CS Blues). The post cards are included in this set. All in all this is a really cool collector's item for fans of the Mick Taylor era who can afford it."
4,A fine representation of versatile Stones at their peak!,"I too am mystified by all the hype about this being one of the greatest albums of all time. It's very good and it rocks in spots, but it sounds like it was recorded in a cheap mobile home with a small tape recorder. This album features however more of a versatile look at the Stones as they cover not only rock but blues, soul, reggae and pop in many different styles. If you love the Stones, they can do no wrong. I really like them, but overall I don't think there as many memorable songs as their other albums and the sound seems tinnier than their previous albums. But this newest remastering on their newer CD sounds punchier and bolder than ever before."
3,A Mixed Bag of Gold & Garbage,"This album is a mixed bag of gold and garbage. The good stuff is worth a modest entry price, but you have to wade through some mediocre stuff to get to the gold. It's a decent album- just don't pay too much for it. You'ld do well to listen to the individual tracks on YouTube or something before parting with your money."
4,"Sounds good, but less filling?","The remastered EXILE sounds ... OK. Better than the old CD or vinyl versions? Well -- as someone who started out listening to rock on a little transistor radio under the covers at night, maybe the subtleties of enhanced audio processing are lost on me. I think I actually like the original better, though I don't have the musical or technical vocabulary to precisely explain why.I really got this for the second disc of previously unreleased tracks. And here again ... interesting, I'm glad to get to hear these, but I'd be even happier about it if I'd paid a little less. ""Loving Cup"" is a great alternate version, and the different-lyrics-over-the-same-music ""Soul Survivor"" sung by Keef is fun, though I wish written lyrics had been provided. But it's pretty much yeah, the best songs were already on the original album in the first place."
5,"Sex, Drugs, Rock 'n' Roll","This album defines the cliche' ""sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll"". Recorded in the basement of Keith Richards' house in France, it has a shoddy production and care-free arrangements. Just as it was intended. Sounds like a bunch of friends got together and turned on the tape recorder. Overdubs at the kitchen table. People talking in the background. A completely honest album. Seering rockers (""Rocks Off, All Down The Line); Gospel-tinged (""Shine A Light""); R&B (""Tumblin' Dice). Great acoustic country campfire numbers (""Sweet Virginia"", ""Torn & Frayed""). And of course the signature Keith with ""Happy"". A-Z, dirty rock music the way God planned it. 18 beautiful tracks. Highly, highly underrated album. Stones at their best. All the myths are lived through this one release."
4,Stones at their Best!,"'Exile on Main Street' was the last of several albums the Stones created in their most creative and meaningful period of '68 through '72. The music is heavily flavored with Blues, R n' B and Gospel - the very sounds they absorbed and re-interpreted so well. There is not a bad cut on this album - it rocks from beginning to end. I think it is under-rated by many and loved by those who like their rock hot and spicy!"
4,dirty rock and roll,"This is the pure rock and roll album that laid the foundation for all other rock albums to come. The Stones created a muddled sound that really makes this album work all together. It's not that it has great singles but it has great rock songs. ""Sweet Virginia"" is my favorite but really the whole album needs to be listened to. This is one of their best along with all the other albums from 1968 to 1973. They would never meet that creative period again and ""Exile"" was their best. Also, see ""Beggar's Banquet"" and ""Let it Bleed."""
5,The Best Album Ever,This is by far the best Rolling Stones album. Every track is incredible. I have seen the Stones 45 times and they just never get old. True Rock Gods.[...] --> Stones Merch and out of print rock stuff.
4,Rolling Stones,"I owned the LP version of this for many years, and now the CD version finally since I don't play LP's anymore. Sound is great."
5,Are You Crazy?,"I am simply going to say this: Anyone who does not give this 5 stars must have their head examined. This is rock and roll. This is arguably the greatest album of all time. The Rockers like Tumbling Dice, the ballads like loving cup and Keith's compositions are all masterpieces. And yes, this is on par with the White Album and Abbey Road. What's wrong with you people?"
5,don't get a leap outta Lear Jets,"Better than the White Album and in many ways more diverse and dynamic. Probably the greatest pop or rock album ever made, at least in terms of scope, depth and vibe. Best use of horns on a rock record, Charlie's best drumming (Rocks Off and Rip This Joint blast outta the blocks) and Mick's best lyrics (Tumblin' Dice - could argue for Brown Sugar). Get it if ya ain't got it."
5,Exile!,"This is the World's Greatest Rock and Roll band doing what they do best. They blend blues, country, r&b, and even gospel and it still sounds like Rock n Roll. Who's Next is the only album that even compares with this one. The thing that makes it all so much better is the live emotion that resulted from a good portion of it being recorded in Keith Richard's basement. It almost feels like it is something from some garage band not caring about money but just wanting to make amazing music. I'll have to admit, it didn't take that well at first, but for me, a lot of Stones stuff didn't. Now, after listening to it over and over, like the rest of the Stones stuff, I love it. It is more of a complete album than any of there other releases. Although Rip This Joint, Rocks Off, Sweet Virginia, Tumbling Dice, and Happy are among my favorites, after a while, you begin to realize that it is meant to be played start to stop or not at all. Amazing album that everyone with a pulse should own."
5,What can you say ?,"I can't really add much to most of the stellar reviews on here. This is the real deal folks. I absolutely worship the Stones, both their recorded output and as a live act. But this album is on a whole different level. Truly, a defining moment for the band and rock music in general. This one sets the standard."
4,Essential rock and roll listening....,"There is undeniably no other album in the Stones' canon like it, and on no other album did they tackle so many diverse styles (Sticky Fingers comes close, but is only a single album). Though they may have relied on the horns and backup singers a bit excessively on this one, its definetly one of their say top 5 defining albums, for the rough and tumble raunch of songs like 'Rocks Off', and the way they were able to switch gears into the soaring melodicism of tracks like 'Loving Cup', 'Torn and Frayed' and 'Shine A Light'. Probably the last album on which the Stones hit the mark so much with so little effort."
4,new to rock but what a great introduction,If a album sums up a band sound and integrity then this album does all that imo. The different takes of such musical nuances all in one package.Aside from the elitist that has said much things not up to par or off kilter etc. Just sit back and let it stand on it's own two legs and possibly it will run up and boogie woggie along with honky tonk your soul to bluesville. Loving cup torn and frayed (A brilliant cover by the crowes on their latest tour by the way) stop breaking down shine a light among many others are simply in my mind just a seance of magical interweavings of a band working as one.And Keith Richards lead vocals on happy are simply blissful to one's ear.As another reviwer advised pass the bourbon mama and let's take a exile on main st.
5,Stone copying aerosmith???????????,The guy who wrote that the Stones were ripping Aerosmith off should check his history and find out that when this record was released aerosmith had yet to have a record released.
5,Some of the Stones Best NON-Hits!!!,"I still own my 27 original Stones purchases on vinyl, and Exile on Main Street is easily in my Top 3. Why?? Because of classics like Tumbling Dice, Rocks Off, Rip This Joint and Happy?? No actually, because of the plethora of beautiful non-hits all over this album.Sweet Virgina, Shine A Light (beautiful), Loving Cup (incredible), Sweet Black Angel, I Just Want To see His face and All Down the Line are some of the greatest songs out of Jaggar/Richards. Bluesy, diverse, rocking, they are differnet songs but united by some of their best lyric writing. The sympathy and redemption of Shine a Light is tremendous, the country rock of Sweet Virgina will lift a mood, and Loving Cup is one of the best all around rock songs the Stones gave us. You will be straining to sing ""Give Me a Little Drink.....From Your Loving Cup"", after your second listen, I promise....."
5,Best rock 'n roll recording ever,"Simply put....this is the best rock and roll recording ever! The rawness, raucousness, and bluesy energy of the Stones in their prime is the way all rock and roll should sound. Bury me with a copy of Exile on Main Street next to John Lee Hooker in Keith Richards back yard and paint a smile on my face!"
3,An Extremely Overrated Album - Even Mick Thinks So!!,"This would be a good album if half of it wasn't included. Songs like ""Rocks Off,"" ""Loving Cup"" and ""Rip This Joint"" are essential Stones songs, but this includes a lot of fluff like ""Shake Your Hips,"" ""Casino Boogie,"" ""Turd on the Run"" and especially ""I Just Want to See His Face.""Even Mick Jagger stated in a Rolling Stone magazine interview in 1994 that this is an overrated album. ""Beggar's Banquet,"" ""Sticky Fingers,"" and especially ""Let it Bleed"" are better albums and deserve the title as the Stones's greatest albums."
2,Don't waste your money,The 1994 remastered collection is what this is based on.The reason the additional tracks weren't on the original release is self-eveident.
3,Could Have Been Edited to One Very Good Album,"Everyone heaps praise on this, but like the Beatles White Album, I think it could have been condensed into one very good album. Don't get me wrong - there are some great songs here - Sweet Vriginia, Torn and Frayed, Tumbling Dice, etc. - but is Turd on the Run really top notch Stones material? Ventilator Blues and Just Wanna See His Face also could have been dropped without any big loss. I know that diehard Stones fans will disagree, but this album has way too much ""filler""."
3,Masterpiece???,"It strikes me as amusing how Stones fans nit pick other artist albums, and trash the whole thing based on one or two tunes, and call something like this a masterpiece. Masterpiece huh? Based on what? ""Tumbling Dice""? Its a good song, but other than that, these tunes are just ordinary-George Thoroghood(?) or AC/DC have made much better albums full of this kind of music, and theyre not hailed as masterpieces. Id venture to say that only the Stones most loyal fans would consider this a ""masterpiece"". Its a good little rocking album, but nothing earthshattering, or even very memorable. Other than Beggars Banquet, and Let It Bleed, the Stones arent known for great albums, never have and never will. So stop bashing Led Zep, The Who, and the Beatles to try and justify you appreciation of the Stones. Definately a great rock band, with some of the greatest rock songs ever recorded by anyone, anywhere. But definately not an album band. And definately minus a masterpiece!"
2,8 of 18 songs are keepers,"i loved every stones album until this one, which is weak sloppy messy boring & not memorable. i own the cd but i copied the best 8 out of 18 songs onto a tape with the best songs from Some Girls. sticky fingers was the last great stones album. they should now be permanently retired."
1,NOT VERY GOOD.... NO SATISFACTION HERE,"I LOVE THE STONES AND I LIKE MOST OF THE ALBUMS THEY PUT OUT BUT I REALLY DO NOT LIKE THIS CD.IT'S FLAT BORING AND DULL.I NO THE HARD CORES WILL DISAGREE BUT I AM A LONG TIME STONES LOYALIST AND I JUST THINK THIS CD FALLS SHORT.AS A COLLECTOR I NEEDED IT BUT FOR LISTENING I NEVER PLAY IT. GET, LET IT BLEED OR SOME GIRLS YOU WILL BE A LOT MORE SATISFIED."
2,The Greatest Rock Band In The World?,"What? They aren't the best rock band in the world. The only rock songs that rock are Start Me Up and Shattered. What's the point? They used to play punk back in the 60's. They were never the best rock band in the world. Or maybe they are, they are a great band but they are way better than the Who. The Beatles suck!"

1,GARBAGE,joe fleckenstein here to give you his opion of this sucky band. they were sucky not half as good as led zepplin or metalica. Terrible muscianship blended in with mcjaggers whiny and awful voice. completely talentless utterly bnal trash. i would recomend this to you unless you enjoy going to the dentist. keith richards was a terrible guitarist. metalicas guitarist could play circles around him. you people who like stones dont know good guitar work. anyway terrible awful album avoid like the plaque.
1,"hey, vinyl fans - ""screw you!""","Do Not Buy This Reissue. This reissue comes with none of the bonus material. I can understand not including a 3rd record with the bonus tracks on it, but they don't even bother with a CD insert or an MP3 download of the bonus tracks. All you get is the original tracks in an insultingly cheap version of the original jacket. Get $12 together, go to your local used record store, and buy a decent used copy of this fantastic album. You won't get this big middle finger being offered up by Universal Music Group, and you might even find a copy with the zany postcards intact."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"I had read a review where they had concerns over the re-mix quality, I must agree they have done a very poor job from a sound quality standpoint. I have listened to the LP a few times and doesn't matter where the volume is set, it hurts my ears. This is a great LP by the Stones, just be sure and find an original recording, not the remastered."
1,Hello?,I asked a question about this item and it's been a week and no answer. Looks like I'll be purchasing somewhere else.
3,Decent but forgettable,"Quirky and poppy and reminds me of a less broody Talking Heads. However, the lyrics are very forgettable and absurdly inane. The music is quite catchy but I can't find myself singing along. The most interesting thing which I usually forget about is the drumming. The drummer seems to keep things interesting underneath some songs' otherwise repetitive chords played by the guitars and synths with offbeat snare pops, rumbling toms and jangling hi-hats."
5,good retro vibe,Being ahuge fan of 80's new wave music. I like this album alot. Reminds me of xtc of course also a little of madness thrown in. I recomend this to fans of 80's new wave.
5,FREEEEEKING AWESOME MAN!!!!,"this cd is awesome, i love it, it's adorable. i was waltzing around F.Y.E. and heard the radio play ""i love you cause i have to"" and immediately sought out the cd just cuz of that one song. i was scared but i was not disappointed. this cd is FREEEEEKING AWESOME MAN!!! the tracks are trippy pop awesome. track 2 is awesome!!! this is some going-away-to-college driving music. excellent man. nice mix of indie-folk-pop-punk, and everything else. get it because it's good for your health."
1,A Complete and Utter Rip Off of XTC,"I can't believe a band can get away with this. Well I guess I can, but...... Not only do they instrumentally sound like XTC, they even have the vocals down as well. Pretty shameless to copy a great band and pass it off as new and innovative to the unsuspecting. Is it that hard to come up with your own stuff? I mean bands will always pull sounds from this or that band and come up with something relatively fresh, but this is just shy of musical plagerism. Shameless, corporate-spewed fluff."
4,No expectations.....no problems!,"Just happened to see this on the shelf as another CD to buy in the 2 for $25 category. Picked it up, listened, strange...listened again, hmmm, I'm remembering hooks now. Soon enough after a few more listens, this bands got me singing some of their songs. They're pretty catchy, pretty poppy, pretty good. It's different than what's out on the airwaves, thank god."
3,more deserving records out there,"there is another band who are more clever (and yes i think the Dogs' single is pretty good on its own--and a few songs on this debut are very catchy and rollicking) at cloning XTC--they are called THE SUGARPLASTIC. give them a chance. there is another band as well that is like the folkier XTC that has a new ""innercity garden"" EP out--they are called THE BLACK WATCH. both of these pop outfits are much more deserving than the Dogs."
3,You get what you pay for.,"The chargers indicator stays green and does not give proper charge, after trying to charge my third battery I realized that I should have bought a Sony. Thank you four timely shipping.Flavio327"
1,You get what you pay for,"After the second or third charge, this no longer works. Seems like you get what you pay for. Not worth sending back.Now we purchased a Sony AC-SQ950 charger. Quite a bit more expensive, but hopefully it will last much longer. It also charges 2 batteries, has quick charge (for SQ batteries), charges faster regardless, and has a readout for how much longer it will take to charge. If you want a real charger, get a AC-SQ950 for your M series batteries."
4,Battery holds up so far,"So far this battery has performed as expected. Only time will tell if it is as good or better that the original. As for the charger it too performs as expected, how long it lasts only time will tell. But so far I would have to say that they both are worth the money I payed."
4,Good value.,Received this in a fairly timely manner considering that I am in New Zealand. And for under half what rip off artists over here want for it. It's not even twice as expensive as a stock replacement. Fits perfectly even though no Toyota Caldina listed. Just crossed the original part number over. Always pays to check though.
4,Increase in HP NO noticable increase in MPG,"This product is great because it lasts longer than other filters making it pay for itself in other filter costs. I had a noticeable increase in horsepower, however this product made NO noticeable difference in miles per gallon."
3,Worth the money.,These holiday type films are just that. A sort of treat during the holidays for every one in the family. You will like this one. I have dozens of these and I am glad I added this one this year.
4,Happy with purchase,Love the movie - had been waiting to be able to purchase it and it was sent timely and met my expectations.
5,Great movie!,This was a gift for a family member and she loved it! I have been waiting for this Lifetime movie to come out on DVD and was glad to see that it was available. Plus this is a great story as well!
4,Love the magic of Christmas,So glad this finally came out on DVD...a holiday favorite for me. Love the actors and the magic of Christmas.
4,Nice to have this Christmas fluff available,"This movie is now 15 years old and only sporadically shown on TV (not at all this year, as I can see, because of an outright explosion of new Christmas TV movies). So, it is nice to have it on DVD.The plot for this movie had been filmed before, in the 1940's, with Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck (titled ""Remember the Night""). Pretty good back then, but a little on the dark side by modern Christmas movie standards. This remake, makes it lighter than air, but also takes a little of the believability out of it. However, the leads are great, and very likable, and who's to quibble. It's a very entertaining way to spend a Christmas time evening.By the way, this plot was used again, in ""Undercover Christmas"" with Jamie Gertz, and Tyne Daly. (Not yet on DVD in 2012.)"
2,Don't buy this unless you are really into operator theory!,"This book is very technical in the mathematics of shift operators: even with a good understanding of Hilbert spaces and Banach theory this book will be very hard to read. If you are a PH. D. student in this specific are of math, it might be useful, otherwise it is probably a waste of money! Even if it is cheap!"
2,Not impressed...,"Maybe I was expecting too much, but I wish I hadn't wasted my $$$ on this book. The book is dry and contains nothing special. The information written is pretty much common sense thinking. The author really doesn't tell us anything that most of us don't already know. (Avoid ""empty"" calories from foods such as cakes, cookies, & candy and focus on getting your nutrition from healthier choices.) Save your money, and instead refer to the web or your doctor for information regarding what to eat and how much while pregnant."
1,A very inaccurate book,"I fought Synanon for over a decade and possess they internal memos showing their conspiracy to commit violence. The evidence was offered to writer and publisher who turned it down to meet ""deadline. The book is highly inacurrate, didn't follow the evidence. Conclusions on brainwashing and violence embarrassingly understated.Only true history of Synanon is [...]"
3,Basic story on Synanon.,"Not the most exciting book I have ever read but it was interesting and informative in a text book kind of way . Doesn't really give you the dirt,but it does give you the basic story on Synanon."
3,Just as advertised,Book was in exact shape as advertised and was shipped promptly. Would use again in a heart beat.
5,Excellent guide for system architects and project managers!,"If you're in the process of architecting a new system or planning to rearchitect an existing system, this book will prove invaluable in helping you evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Even if you're just interested in both technologies and want to dig deeper into each, this book is a sure bet!"
5,Love them! So bright and cool.,"I bought the red, yellow, orange and blue more as art for my loft rather than for their practical applications. I love the way they look, so vibrant and funky. They do fit together, but you will have to put a bit of muscle into it. As an ottoman, they'd prob be perfect, but they're quite firm, so not sure they'd make a good chair.All in all, I'd definitely recommend for adding a splash of color to any room."
5,6-pc T-Handle Hex End Wrench Set,"I needed to retighten a few existing electrical conections, and I the Insulated T-Handle Hex End 6 Pc Set worked the way I needed and expected them too, Amazon.con was the best price I found for this item.DaveLas Vegas, NV"
3,Editions,"This book is great but I would reccomend getting the edition before, anymore than one edition off and it throws you in the class. I wrote a paper on a passage in here the essay was fine but the author was different genders. My professor and I had a wonderful time aruging over if it was male or female and figuring out that problem. XD"
3,Excellent ideas for peace in Middle East!,"This work was well-though out, but not well edited. Still for informational purposes, there are no rivals in terms of water policy and its impact on the peace process."
5,Beautiful and functional!,"The pan heats quickly and evenly and is extremely versatile. I was impressed by how easily it cleaned and resisted staining. It also is beautifully designed - the handle stays cool and though the pan is heavy it's not nearly as weighty as cast-iron. Add the fact that it's much, much cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else and you have a fantastic pan!"
4,Nice mid-sized saucepan,"This 3 qt pan is a great size for smaller families. nicely made. Would have reviewed slightly higher but the handle is a bit skinny feeling in my hand and when empty the pan is not perfectly balanced. But, for the price and all steel construction its a nice pan. Great for all kinds of foods and cleans up well."
5,Great Cookware,"I really like the saucepan. Bought two to accompany a couple of stainless steel KitchenAid's I have. They are great looking, well made, and I love the lower profile on a 2.5 quart size. My initial impression after cooking with them a few times is that they are an absolute steal at this price as a participating item in Amazon's 4 for 3 pricing."
5,Turning Toward Joy,This is an excellent book to use if you desire greater joy in your life. It takes you through the book of Phillipians and is an easy-to-understand commentary of the letter from Paul to the Phillipians. David Jeremiah is an excellent Biblical author. I highly reccomend this book.
3,Good for intense study,"I have always found Edershiem to be an excellent author and gifted theologian but reading this book just backed that up. The reader however, must take into consideration that it was written in the 1800's, so some of the theology and doctrine of it may still be from the middle-ages. Beyond that, he makes excellent points and really stretches the mind. If the reader is serious about learning theology and Bible history, this is a good book."
3,Least favorite Heyer so far,"This was by far my least favorite of Georgette Heyer's books. After the promise of the first few chapters, I found Horatia to be an irritating twit and could not fathom why Lord Rule would have been in love with her."
4,"A quick, enjoyable read","This was a quick, funny read--the secondary characters were quirky and often LOL-hilarious. I adore the hero, the Earl of Rule, and how he's perpetually slumberous, amiable, and oh-so-polite. The heroine was also a unique character, although there were times that I thought she was too flighty and stubborn for her own good. I don't recall ever having read about a heroine who is a ""hereditary"" gambler, and it's a testament to Georgette Heyer's skill that I overcame my initial aversion to this aspect of Horry's personality. I would recommend to this fans of the Georgian period."
3,"Began promising, fizzled out","This book looked like it was going to be charming in the first couple of chapters. Lord Rule and Horry's meeting was a really humorous and delightful scene. Unfortunately, once it got underway, I quickly lost interest. Horry's stammer was really annoying to read and I found her naivete and stupidity astounding! This was my first Heyer that followed a married couple and needless to say it didn't leave a very good impression."
4,good book,"Read this book was short, I liked it, but was a little confussing, i would have loved to read more of The Earl (Marcus) and Haratia (Harry). There was alot in there of other charactors. I was glad that Harry and the Earl did have feelings for each other, which the basically told each other at the end. Wish to read more of them!"
4,"Came for the reader, stayed for the story","I only bought this so Richard Armitage could read me a bedtime story. In the end, I very much enjoyed the romance and I thought the characters were well-voiced. With the intricate dialogues in some scenes, RA's distinct and often humorous characterizations were very helpful. I didn't much like Horry; I prefer my heroines with a bit more art and a lot more intelligence."
3,Not one of the best,"While I have been a fan of Georgette Heyer since the mid-1960's, I can honestly say I did not enjoy this book very much as the main character, Horatia, is just too immature, silly, and plain annoying. I found myself wondering over and over again why the Earl would put up with her. Perhaps my dislike comes from listening to the audio version of the book, I don't know. Over the years I have read many of Heyer's books and know she is a wonderful author, but I doubt I would've liked this character even when I was a teenager like Horatia. Like another reviewer said: Read this one for the hero(the Earl of Rule)!"
1,Difficult reading,It was not easy reading. I found myself reading each sentencetwice to understand what was being said. I decided not to finish the book.
3,Hard for me to like Horatia,I have to say that I love Georgette Heyer and have never been disappointed but our heroine here is not interesting me in the least. She's annoying boring and I find myself wishing that it was another character that was going to catch the eye of Rule.The stammer doesn't bother me but I just feel like the other characters in the book that she's immature young and doesn't carry anything interesting for me to wish the Rule would fall for her. The first meeting didn't grab me with these two and that's vastly disappointing as I always rely on Heyer to take me in with the couple upon first sighting even if they aren't at first attracted to each other.This is the first time for me that it falls flat and I'm disappointed.
2,Ok but better version by Ana Blackwell available!,"If you are interested in A. Kardecs books relating to Spiritism, read Spirits & Mediums books by Anna Blackwell also New Version by Allan Kardec Edu. Soc of Phil, Pa. excellent !"
3,Visiting the past.,"I read this book when at school, this time round I found it a bit dated but still very enjoyable."
4,"A True, Worthy Classic","Sometimes it seems that half of the books on this site have been called ""classic"" by someone at some time. When I decided I really needed to try this book, I more or less expected something along the lines of Disney's ""Charlie, the Lonesome Cougar"". Well, surprise, guess what? This is a really great book.It is powerful, clear-eyed, direct and informed by a natural and compelling realism. It is violent, but honestly so. It is plain, unvarnished and unsympathetic. It is exciting and yet a romantic adventure. It is authentic as only good fiction can be. It really is a classic, and it should be available for your young reader."
4,Review Of Call Of The Wild,"This book was a pretty good book. It was about a dog named Buck who learns to become a sled dog. Throughout the story he gets many different owners, some good, some bad. At the end of the book he heres a howl from the forest. So he follows it and he is never seen again. There are a few videos about that are also interesting. Over all it's a good book to read."
3,I think Call of the Wild by Jack London was an alright book.,"I think Call of the Wild by Jack London was an alright book. About a trip through the Yukon with a bunch of sled dogs including Buck. ""Naivre such a dog as dat Buck""(pg 27) was said by Francois, which is quite true. Buck was a great dog very strong and he worked hard if you treated him right. He was especially loyal to John Thorton, whom of which he cared very much for. When John Thornton was murdered Buck became free and loved it. John Thorton was Bucks last tie to mankind, when he died he had nothing left but the wild.I thind this book had a good plot and some great points, but all in all I didn't like it. It just wasn't an appealing subject to me."
3,"A good story, but confusing","Jack London's Call of the Wild is interesting in how it lets the reader imagine what it's like to be suddenly taken to a completely different environment, but the book is confusing and, at times, dull. I like the personification of the dog, but when Buck calls people and dogs half breeds, full breeds, etc, it takes a while to figure out what they are. Between the exciting scenes are long, drawn out worthless bits of drama, but when its good, its pretty good. I do like the richness and abundance of the descriptive details, though."
2,The Call of the Wild,"In my opinion, The Call of the Wild is a good book to read if you are wanting something quick to read. If you are interested in dogs than this is the book for you. It is loaded with lots of detail, but within the course of the book not a whole lot is covered. At the begginng of the book it is very slow, but near the end it starts getting good. It is definitely not hard reading. Anywhere from a fifth to sixth grader would be able to read this book. I probably wouldn't suggest it, but after reading I can say that it is a decent book."
2,Not pleasing,I did not like this book. It was very confusing and boring. I'm used to reading about action and adventure not dogs in the snow. Some may find it cute or compelling but for me it was just plain childish and corny.
4,Pretty Good,"This was an okay book. Some parts were kind of boring, but most kept you want to keep reading. I liked the ending the best, b/c the dog, Buck, goes where he's always wanted to."
2,Call of the Wild Review,"Call of The Wild ReviewThe Call of the Wild, by: Jack London is an excellent short read. This classic is about a dog named Buck, and his life. Buck goes from being a pampered pet to a sled dog pulling mail for the Canadian government. This book is seven chapters long, and a great book for those of us who like books written from the point of view of animals. However, I wouldn't recommend this for readers who like to challenge themselves, the vocabulary and content of the book is pretty elementary. Make no mistake I think Jack London is a magnificent author, but The Call of the Wild is to short for my taste, and probably most adults."
3,It was an ok book,I just resently finished the book the call of the wild. It is an ok book. I liked how they had it in the dogs point of view. I would probably recomend this book to other people. I would read more of his books.
3,cold of the wild,"L's wilderness books are really interesting at times. many details about survival and adjusting to the wilderness. his writing styles is simple, and it should be, when describing the wilderness. this book is about two characters. one dog, one man. interesting read."
4,"Not the best, but it was enjoyable.","I was assinged this book as a novel to read for school. At first I didn't want to read it, all my friends said it was stupid. I should have known not to listen to my friends. This book was very good. I am not going to say awsome because at some points there was so much detail it was rediculus. The plot had a lot of twists. I read ahead in the book instead of reading at the pace of the class because I was very into it and the class was reading WAY to slow. Nothing agenst them, sorry getting off track. This book was told from a pont a view you don't see a lot of, it is told from the dogs point of veiw. along the whole book we get to see Buck ( the main character) grow and change. watching how Buck changed is what i liked about the book. I would recomend this book to all who need something to read"
1,May as well be downloaded and printed on computer paper.,"When I buy a book, I'm not expecting to get something printed on 8.5"" paper in 12 pt Times New Roman. I could just as easily downloaded the text for the book online and stuck it in a folder. Awful. I would absolutely recommend not buying this book. I will never read this copy."
2,"Another Man vs. Nature (ok, Dog vs. Nature)","The story of Buck and cut-throat survival seemed rather cliched. As the traditional American frontier has basically ended, these symbolic stories of adventure and hardship do help to serve as a representation of challenges, but there are such better works that achieve these goals. Even a novel like The Catcher in the Rye uses savvy to explain the ironies and false pretenses that life offers. Holden, like Buck, is faced with the choice of how to adapt in a losing situation. While you may now be wondering how The Call of the Wild and this Salinger novel can be paralleled, the point is that the theme is so universal and not restricted by the plot, that there are many other works that accomplish similar goals."
1,"If you like boring books, this one's for you","I am reading Call of the Wild for an Accelerated English class and I can not stand it. I don't see why so many people find it exciting and a ""classic"", and I know even if I was not reading it for an assignment I would still find it dull. I mean,the main characters are dogs, the plot is very slow and boring, and it is extremely predictable. It is one of those books that I would try to read, but never finish. I have to do an essay, plot chronology, ect. on a group of prissy dogs stuck in the Yukon suffering from a reality check. This is not anywhere near my definition of a classic novel,it is more like a waste of time."
1,I thought this was SUCH a boring book!,"Ok, matbe it's just me, but what's so interesting about reading about a bunch of dogs in a sled team. This book was so boring and really hard to follow at some points. Also, it doesn't relate to my life at all. It was the worst book I have ever read."
1,I HATE THIS BOOK,"this book really gets on my nerves. it's about a spoiled little dog that sits on his spoiled yet ""hardened"" butt on his ""sun-kissed"" farm.things only go downhill from there. buck- (that's the dog) is now forced to be a sled dog. (the horrors.) read this book- but only if you're brave enough."
5,Called BACK to the Wild yet again...,"... and this time I've brought my son with me!! This is a classic on so many levels -- as a quick ride through the turn-of-the-century (the LAST century, that is!) Klondike; as yet another of London's lessons in ""man vs. nature""; etc. -- but the reader who sees it as ""just some story about a dog"" is truly missing its greatness! For instnace, be sure to keep an eye open for Mr. London's socialistic views (e.g., ideals of becoming leaner and meaner as individuals and, subsequently, as a society) as well!!"
4,oh that Buck,"Tale of a dog that gets dognapped and taken from the comfortable confines of the Santa Clara region to a much less friendly Alaska.How will it survive? By size and instinct. Really this is a good read, but I think the themes in it are better explored in his other book, ""the Sea Wolf""."
5,The call of the wild,"Amazing just amazing never read a book like it the excruciating detail had me just not stop reading it. I started up late every night just to read it, Jack London your are a matter"
3,This movie a good watch,"This version did not follow the 8th grade novel read in my language arts class, but it is a great story. Students like it and if anyone is a dog lover, they will love it."
1,Call of the what??!,"No doubt, ""Call of the Wild,"" is one of the most boring books I have ever read. Reading it is like a nightmare. It should be properly be labled ""Call of Boredom,"" and I'm not kidding! Though it's only 150+ pages, and it includes only seven chapters, it really drags and you'll fall asleep after reading its first few pages.It has no story at all. It's just about some dog who has to survive in the wilderness of Alaska after getting kidnapped. Jeez! What kind of plot is that? This book includes lots of poor, one-dimensional characters, even annyoning ones like Francois. It's really pointless to read, and I recommend that you stay away from it, unless you are forced to read it for school. ""Call of Boredom"" is one of the world's overrated books, and I mean it."
3,My Book Review,"The Call of the Wild by Jack London gave me a nonchalant feeling. It is one of those so-so books that you read just to read it. The Call of the Wild is a boring book to read. Because of the tedious actions done by the characters, you really would not get a feel of the story. The story did not keep me interested. This book did not leave an indelible mark on me whatsoever. When the protagonist is walking through the mounds of snow, the author could have described the scene more so the reader could almost feel the same way as the characters were. Although I did not like this story I would recommend this book to kids between 7-11 years of age to let them know how other sorts of books are."
3,Call of the Wild,"I thought Call of the Wild, by Jack London had too much detail. In some places, the detail was needed, but sometimes it was just too much. The begining and end of the book was interesting, but the middle part was just stupid.It was like,"" Oh my gosh Buck! We have to deliever the mail!"" This wasn't my favorite book, and if reading Call of the Wild wasn't school required , I would have chose another book."
3,welcome to the primordial world!,"I read this book in my grade 8 english class. It was a pretty good book. I must admit, I had dooubts about it at first. The whole wildneress thing isn't usually 4 me. But it was actually pretty good!!Buck is one of those characters that you really get attached to, and if you like animals, especially wild ones...give this book a shot. It's good!!"
2,It needed more pictures.,"I thought the book was interesting yet boring in a way. I liked the part when John Thornton whispered in Bucks ear and said ""Do it as if you love me"". There was also alot of cheasy parts in the book. I also thought the book went too into detail in spots it didn't need it. It really didn't get my attention enough. In some parts it made me want to keep reading, but it didn;t enough."
1,product not as decribed,the product I received was not the same as described on the wed site.I was very disappointed with the book. that is why I returned it.
2,This is not a very interesting book,"The problem with this book is that it seemed like nothing really happened until the end ... and I don't want to spoil that for you by telling you about it. There were some characters that could have been interesting, but they were under-developed - tough to figure out where they fit in. I would not recommend this book."
1,The worst book ever. Who cares about dogs in the Yukon?,"Don't ever read this. Okay, a dog could really go from being spoiled in California to the best dog in the Yukon. Huh, believable, right? Take my advice, don't read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Old, but not outta touch","This book is good enough for a wide range of readers. A younger crowd may find it boring, but with enough action to keep them entertained. Also, the book only had 7 chapters, but with enough detail to keep you informed. (Perhaps too much.) Despite the good, at a few parts you may find yourself happy about things that you wouldn't normally be glad about. (Like death.) All in all, this book was good, but I wouldn't probably read it again under my own free will."
4,The Awesome Buck by: La'Shantena,"When I first starded to read The Call of The Wild by Jack London, I thought the book was boaring. After reading several chapters I begin to enjoy the story. I felt that Jack London gave a powerful messege to let you know that you should never be content in life because you never know when thing may change. This was shown by Buck who had a very good life living with Judge Miller. After he was stolen and sold several times he found himself in a cold, mean, harsh world. He hafd to learn how to adjust to a different way of life.I think the book is a great book for young teenage children. He teach you how to set your goals in life, however your goals should not be base on one thing."
4,Call of the Wild is Still a Classic,"This novel, even in 2004, can still be considered a major piece of literature that has infulenced American Literature since its first writing. Adventure, intrigue, hardships, friendships, and loyalty,even if it means death, are all found in this story. Aren't these the elements of a good example of literature. Isn't this what we educators still use to engage our students into reading? Dog lovers will adore this book, written in the perspective of our dog hero, Buck, an animal with human-like tendencies,intelligence, strength and dignity. A classic in every true sense is the best way to evaluate this novel. Jack London allows his readings to become a part of his stories; we begin to have empathy for Buck as he nearly dies, or when he risks it all to save his human friend, John Thornton. If you like this book, you might also want to read some of London's other classics White Fang, and Sea-Wolf."
4,Call of The wild,"The title of this book, ""Call of the Wild,"" by Jack London, shows how Buck straddles between two worlds, one as a domestic dog with the ability to be loved and trained, and the other as a primordial beast constantly having the instinct to return to his primitive ways. His journey takes him from being a pampered household pet to running with the wolf pack and surviving in a savage environment. Along the way he learns to fear some humans, to survive among savage dogs, and to love a master."
4,The Call of the Wild review,"In the story ""The Call of the Wild"" by Jack London, the protagonist is a large Southland dog named Buck. Buck leads a life of luxury with his master, Judge Miller, in California's Santa Clara Valley. One day he is kidnapped and sent to Canada's Klondike region, to become a sled dog, working the gold rush. Here, Buck is forced to deal with Canada's arctic temperatures, along with learning the ropes of being a sled dog. The story follows Buck from his first fight, to becming his team's lead dog, to near starvation, to finally becoming one with the wild. This is a heart warming story that readers and dog lovers of all ages can enjoy."
4,London Weathers Time,"London's dog tale, while moderately archaic in prose and style, effectively engages the reader to view events from the canine's perspective."
3,My review,A great book and a true classic. I would recommend it to beginner book lovers. And teens with good vocabulary
3,Good for My Home Library,"Haven't read it yet, but have seen the movie before. I will get around to reading it soon. When I have time."
5,Amazing as ever,I read this years ago as a youth. It is still an amazing tale. I recommend this book for ALL ages.
4,A must read,"A must read book. Very well written. Touching story may bring some to tears at times, may make some angry."
5,Interesting and fun read!,"This was my first 'Kindle' read and I loved it. I had never read it before and now I know why it is a classic.Without giving away too much, the story is told from a Dog's point of view, and is masterfully done. It is clever but not cliche, it really pulls you into the story and makes it exciting.I recommend this book for anyone that wants a book of adventure but with enough of a twist to keep things interesting."
3,Call of the wild,Classic worth reading and what a gem to be able to use it on my Kindle. A great read and a great way to spend your time reading one of the great classics.
4,Great classic!,"I think this book is a great classic to read. The language is a little difficult, but it is still understandible. It is a great book for school reading, and for book reports too. I recomend this book for anyone."
3,The call of the wild,"This book was pretty good. I really liked the whole story plot behind it. It was slow in the beginning, but as I read on it became more interesting. It's a must read classic."
3,Recommended for anyone who loves to read about the outdoors.,"In the book the Call of the Wild by Jack London, there are very good descriptions and I would reccommend it to anyone who is interested. The main character is a dog named Buck. I love the descriptions that London gives about all the dogs. He tells you emotions as well as physical traits in great detail. However, he could have spent more time describing the humans. This book is, in my opinion, hard to follow. There are a lot of flashbacks and dreams. This makes it hard to tell whether the book is in the present or flashback. The weather and conditions of the land were described well also. ""No lazy, sun-kissed life was this, with nothing to do but loaf and be bored. Here was neither peace, nor rest, nor a moments' safety."" (London page 8) This is a prime example of the description of enviromental conditons. To sum things up, I would reccommend this book to any person interested in the era of the Gold Rush and the great outdoors."
4,Call of the Wild is truly a wonderful piece of literature.,"I read this book as an 8th grader and didn't take much at all from it. Reading it now as a sophomore I realize what Jack London was getting at the whole time. Everyone deep inside is truly a savage such as Buck knew he was. Domestication was holding him back from what he really was. Out in the Artic where he ancestors resided once, brought out his primitive instincts actually learning there's more to life then he knew."
3,"Good story, but a disappointing ending","The Call of the Wild was a good, enjoyable book. Not the best I've ever read, mind, but easy and relaxed and straightforward. However, the book left a bitter taste in my mouth, so to speak, because of the ending. The ending just spoiled the whole thing. Not because it was unhappy either, (I am a devoted fan of Robert Cormier, patron saint of unhappy endings.) But because it didn't seem right somehow. I mean, Buck just forgets everything he's learned and goes to live with the wolves. It made the whole story seem pointless."
2,The book was verry dull and unenteristing.,"In my opinoin THE CALL OF THE WILD was a non interisting book. The only thing that i thought about the book that was good, was that it was discriptive in the fights against each other. One of the biggest things that i disagree with is the vocabulary, it was very hard for me to read all those big words, and phrases for example. With the Aurora Borals flaming overhead, or the stars Leaping in the first dance,and the land Numb and over its pail of snow. I read that phrase about fivr times and i still do not know what it means. I would only reccomand this book for people who like to read and have a good vocabulary."
3,This book was very well written though it was not my favorit,"In my opinion Jack London's The Call Of The Wild was not as exciting as I thought. The vocabulary sounded very old fashioned and boring.In some paragraphs I didn't even understand what was going on.I did think the story itself was good though. I also like how Jack London described everything in the book.When Buck and Spitz got in a fight it really kept me reading.I also liked the part when John Thorton fell in the river.In the book I liked the quote""I spik true when I say dat Buck two devils."" I think it really explains Buck's character and how he is strong and powerful.The Call Of The Wild is not a book I would have picked to have read on my own but I enjoyed reading it with my english class. I would recommend this book to people who like reading about the outdoors."
2,The Call of the Wild,"First of all the book is about 5"" x 7"", real small. I purchased this for my 10 year old grandson because i read this book when I was about his age and really loved it. This book is written in old english style and small letters. My grandson started reading it and could not understand the words, he got frustrated and gave up. I thought it would be a regular size book geared to children. It is not for children. It is for adults, but not for elderly people because the print is too small. What a disappointment, a book that I had enjoyed so much turned out to be not a very good gift."
4,Call of the Wild,"The book The Call of the Wild is an excellent book. It is about a dog named Buck, who had to struggle while turning from a tame dog to a wild dog. He ran into cruel people, but a man named John Thorton saved his life. Buck and Thorton were devoted to each other until Thorton was killed. Buck then had to live by himself in the wild. I enjoyed this book because of the interesting plot and descriptive phrases. I would recommend this book to other fourth and fifth graders because it is marvelous."
3,Call of The Wild,"""Call of The wild"" is a great novel by Jack London. Buck kidnapped from is home in California is thrown in to a harsh life of dangerous ways of living in the Klondike gold rush that is going on. Buck is half st.Bernard, half shepherd. He is taught to obey his owner by the ""guy in the red sweater""he has to learn to survive on his own; not to trust any one. this is a great adventure story and a lesson of life!"
5,it was a very good book,very interesting and great for people who like to read about dogs and outdoor adventure books
5,Appeals to our desire for freedom,"This book sparks an atavistic strain in all of us. For those of you who feel out of place in the artificial, constraining construct of civilization, this book can be a much needed release."
3,I think that this is a good adventure book for all ages,"In my opinion The Call of the Wild by Jack London is a good book. Jack London was very descriptivein this book. He used very good situations that made me want to read more and more. The one thing I didn't like about this book was that I don't think he used enough dialouge. The part that really stuck in my head was when Buck and Spitz fought to the death. The one thing that Buck had was imagination and that is what won it all. One of the qoutes that really sticks in my head is ""you've learned your place and I know mine."" (pg 6) The man in the red sweater said this to Buck after the beating. overall this was a really good book and I would tell anyone to read this.Toni Nunn"
3,very Simple and Quick,"Jack London's Call of the Wild was, to say the least, an extremely shallow book. London omnisciently narrates the difficult life of a dog named Buck in 217 pages. While the book was with out a doubt interesting, I fear it lacked substance. Its simple nature resembles a children's book but at times the vernacular would be difficult for a child to comprehend. At the same time, the introduction of characters is another confusing aspect as I found myself unable to conclude whether the new character was a dog or a person until five pages after their introduction. This leaves me wondering who his target audience was. It is with out a doubt too simple for an adult, yet too confusing for a child. The book definitely kept my attention, though, for I read it cover to cover in two hours. I suppose I would recommend Call of the Wild to middle-schoolers. They would enjoy the adventure and appreciate not being buried with themes and motifs."
4,Book on Tape Version Classic Tale/Nicely done audio,"That this book is a classic should come as a surprise to no one, so my reveiw is strictly based on the audio version. I first read this novel years ago but recently listened to the tapes on a long car ride with my children. The reader did an excellent job and the story kept us all interested. I recommend this as a great way for a family to share a classic."
2,"Well read, abridged version.",This is not a good version for a classroom setting. The cover doesn't reveal this.
1,THIS BOOK DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR!!!,tHIS BOOK WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!!iT WAS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!
1,Confusing,Jack London wrote this book so that he could win a Newbery Medal. That is why he used complexed words. I am reading this book in school. It is very confusing because it is hard to understand.
1,lacking in dialogue,"it was a liittle confusing. but all in all it was an "" interesting"" book, but because of some of the narrative writing it was boring, and because of some of the events that were happening ,the dog fight, it was "" disgusting""."
5,This is a grate book,Start :(g cu ha f2f st February and a great book is a great book is a great book is a great book is a great book is a
4,Call Of The Wild,"I thoroughly enjoyed the story of Buck, part Saint Bernard and part Shephard who got to know first hand the best and worst of men in the harsh and unforgiving Klondike.Poignant and beautifully written. It really was a joy to read. Time well spent."
3,good book,"I liked the action in the call of the wild, especially the scene with buck and spitz barking for supremecy."
4,A great book about the Alaskan life,"I really enjoyed the Call of the Wild. It goes by very fast with its many adventures. It is a great novel about courage and strength of a sled dog trying to fit in in the Alaskan North. It was very well written, where the dogs don't talk, but their feelings are described. I thought the love between Buck and his last owner was amazing. My favorite thing about this book was the feeling of self dependence it givs you. You will thoroughly enjoy this book."
4,"Adventurous, sad, and exciting all in one","After being taken from his home in the Santa Clara Valley, Buck must learn the law of the harsh north, how to keep what is his and the most important thing, either kill-or-be-killed. Follow Buck with all his masters and try to survive along with Buck. I liked this book because you get to see what it would be like in the wilderness of the north. Another reason is because I am a huge animal lover and this book showed me what the sled dogs have to go through. I loved this book and I think that if you like animal stories, so will you. I think that this book would be appropriate for anyone above ten."
3,It was an okay book.,"Jack London's The Call of the Wild portrayed the Gold rush in the early 1900's. I especially loved how much the dog characters were personified. London described the human characters as if they were animals and the animals as if they were humans. John Thorton is my favorite element in the story. The love between Buck and Thornton gave the book a positive essence after perceiving ideas of all the brutality. On the other hand this story was drawn out, awkwarkly worded, and used exceptional vocabulary. All these concepts made the book boring and incapable of being read to the degree that it was meant to be. Over all I would recomend this book to somebody who enjoys nature, has a high vocabulary and likes to read a book more than once."
2,"Good storyline, but very boring along the way...","I had to read this a part of my English class. It is a good story, and Jack London did a good job of writing it. However, this is the type of book that I will sit and read and slowly my mind drifts off and I start thinking of other things. It's very hard to keep your mind in the story, because the words go into such great details that it's hard to grasp all at once. Jack London's intentions were good. The storyline is very basic and easy to follow, however. It's a light hearted story about a dog Buck and his struggles in life. It makes you wonder how dogs really think. But honestly, I give this story a 2 because it just wasn't what I look for in a book. It's more old fashioned in a way. Maybe I'll have to give it another chance."
3,6th grade Katie,"Buck is a dog that is living the life in a nice house, good life and good friends, when he is kidnapped and taken to be a sled dog. When he is there all the dogs are being beaten to the test. Some die some don't. All the dogs have to do is wait to see what happens to them. Buck then finds out what his life will be. A sled dog.All the dogs there were taken to be sled dogs, but when Buck finally finds out what he is doing he starts living a horrible life. He has to survive the artic winters and become as strong as he can to pull heavy amounts. If he doesn't is might be death for him or worse more beating. All Buck sees is death and pain. Many people die in front of him and even his dog friends that he loved. But finally Buck finds an owner who truly loves him. Buck starts to fell like it was with his old life."
3,Only warm fuzzies,We read this book for school. We have to say it was one of the better school books but it is still not amazing. The stoy line was very hard to follow and the reading was pretty slow. Jack London has a very wordy style.We reccomend this book for older and more expierenced readers that can take a little blood shed. If you liked other Jack London books then we reccoment this one because his writing styles never vary.
3,"Lively plot, historically interesting, NOT great writing","A classic story well-worth reading. The author excels at harnessing you in to root for Buck through all his harrowing adventures in this lively plot. I also found the historical and cultural aspects of the story interesting.Were strength of plot the only factor, I'd rate this novel at 5 stars. Unfortunately, the writing itself is a little lack-luster, good but not great. For an excellent modern treatment of a canine character, try ""The Story of Edgar Sawtelle."""
4,A London classic,"Though its not as great a read as some of his other books, this will still put a hold on your spirit with a call to something greater."
3,"Classic tale, yet lacking detail and depth","I enjoyed this novel, yet found it to be a little short and lacking a certain depth. The fact that it was free allowed to not get really frustrated or disappointed with the lovable Buck."
3,"""The Call of the Wild"" had some high and low points.","I thought ""The Call of the Wild"" was an average book. Jack London did a good job on description. ""The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars."" Symbolism was also very important. On the flip side, I thought it was a little redundant. The allegory was played to death, and some dramatic parts were almost the same. Overall, it was a decent book. When writing an allegory sometimes it is hard to use ones imagination, because one must keep everything sybolized. If you are looking to read a book that has deeper meaning, I would recommend this book. If you are looking to read a fun book I would not."
4,This Book is a very discriptive book.,"My Opinion of CALL OF THE WILD by Jack Londin is a very interesting book. I Liked it. It kept me reading and i did not want to put it down. Jack made the dogs sound like they were human. That is what captivated me. For example at the very beginning on page one. ""Buck never read the newspaper or he would of known the trouble was brewing."" There he tried to make Buck sound like an illiterate person. Then again on page nine when Curly was getting beat up. Buck looked at Spitz and thought ""Spitz ran out his tounge and laughed again, from this point on Buck hated Spitz with a bitter and deathless hatred."" If I would give CALL OF THE WILD a grade it would be a B. I liked how Jack London descibed everything and how he made the animals sound like humans."
3,"Call of the Wild, a good book to read .","The book Call of the Wild was in my opinion , a good book to read . It had a little bit of everything in it ( humor, drama , death etc. ) some vocabulary is a bit old-fashioned , but other than that it is very well written . You feel drawn into the story , and will not want to put it awat . London captured the spirit of the gold rush and the savage behavior of the times . ( p24) ' Mercy was a thing reserved for the gentler climes'. On the trail [ in the Yukon ] you have to have both imagination and instinct, such as Buck had to become lead dog and to kill Spitz , who had been the lead dog . Over all this is a book you will want to finish . I would recommend this book to anyone of anyage ."
4,Literary Gem,"I had to read this book during the summer for school and was not looking forward to it. But the more I got into the book, I started to enjoy it. It's not exactly my kind of book, but it has a great story and amazing descriptions. A great classic!"
4,Call Of The Wild,Call of the Wild was an interesting and violent book. If you do not like gore and violence Do Not READ THIS BOOK. It was somewhat boring at parts but then there was excitment and lots fun gore and broken necks. Not the most ecologically accurate book. the book had a unique perspetive of nature and dogs. thank you.
5,Loved it,"It was one of those books I knew of but had never read. I loved it. I just believed that London was the dog. It seemed so right that if a dog could think and reason, this is exactly how it would think and reason."
4,CALL OF THE WILD,Good book for real it was a book about a dog named buck who is kidnapped and brought to Alaska
5,Call of The Wild,"Call of The Wild is an adventerous, wonderful book. You should read it if you like happy endings and like adventures. In the beggining a nice dog from a rich family gets dognapped. As you can imagine it would probably be scary for a dog whos only been hugged and kept in walls. He gets sold to some men who deliver medicine. He works his way up to the top, has fights with husky's , and has many ferocious adventures. It is very sad in the beging but the ending is very happy. White Fang is another good book by the same author who wrote Call of The Wild."
3,Call of the Wild,The name of the book I read was The Call of the Wild. The call of the wild is in first person.Jack London used many writing styles. Jack London used large words.The characters used slang and dialect. The author's word choice does affect the reader. Jack London does not write dialogue convincingly. I think the author chose his words carefully.The theme of one of the books comes from a wolf that lives in the woods. The wolf goes through many obstacles. In my life I went through many obstacles I feel a personnel connection. This author is well known for writing. I would recommend this book to 9th graders. I don't think this book is for 8th graders. This book did not have an affect on me. I thought that the book was very adventurous. There was alot of traveling and fighting.
5,The Call Of The Wild,I like this book because it gave me something to think about after one chapter because it keeps me i suspense. I liked how they reffered to the dogs as like human characters and how they used figurative language in it.I like it because it shows the life of Buck and how sad it is that the dogs have to go through all of this and how they stay alive. I also like that Jack London (the author) put in that their is a great problem and they end it with a great solution and how Buck finds his way to the wild because his people get killed by the Yeehats. The book is great and i recommend this book to anyone from ages 10-14 because of the words that are in the book. Some of the words are hard to find out unless you look them up. This was a really fun book to read.
2,The Call of the Wild- NOT FOR YOUNG KIDS,"I am in the eighth grade and this was one of the two books that I had to read this year (see my review also for The Giver). This book is about a dog named Buck who is kidnapped and has adventures along the Yukon in a team of sled-dogs. He has trials and tribulations, and the whole time, his ""primordial instinct"" is pulling at his soul, and he yearns to be free and wild.Let me start off by saying that this book is NOT for kids under 11. Some of the details (i.e. a dog is attacked and ripped apart-alive!) are too much for young kids to handle.I personally did not enjoy this book. It was much too grotesque in some details and it made me depressed."
5,"Quick, quick, quick",My son needed this for school. He had it in hand 2 days later! It was much easier than driving to the book store and searching for what we needed. Thank yoU!
3,"Abridged, but still depressing","This abridgement keeps the story line and characters of the original, but cuts out a lot of the descriptions, scene-setting, and sermons to make the book more managable for kids. Still, nothing can take Jack London's story of human malice and cruelty, and the viciousness of dog-status fights to the death, and turn it into a sweet story for dog lovers.Buck, the dog, descends the ladder from loyal and loving pet, to chained and beaten cringer, to skulking wanna-be, to dog killer, to watching humans die, to killing humans.The call of the wild means that inside every good and decent creature, there is a vicious and snarling animal. Only civilization keeps us mannered and orderly.People think this is a story for children, and it's fine as a moral cautionary tale, but it's not entertaining family reading."
3,Beyond Depressing!,"I not only ordered the book but also purchased the audible book. After Jon Katz's reference to Call of the Wild in his books, I was interested to see what inspired him. I kept looking for a happier end for Buc but, unfortunately, it wasn't to be. I found myself gasping in horror, chapter after chapter, while reading the abuse this poor animal received from his many handlers. Not for the animal advocate!!"
3,Thrift Edition fine print,"This is a review of the THRIFT EDITION of the book. The story itself is fine. The thrift edition however is printed with fine print, probably about a font size 8. It was difficult even for a near-sighted teenager to read for extended period of time."
5,"a gripping, compelling read","This is a book about a sled dog's harsh survival in the frozen north. I had to read this for my english classes and i really enjoyed it. Basically, it's about a somewhat spoiled dog named Buck, who gets kidnapped and taken to the snowy wilderness of alaska during the klondike gold rush back in the 1800's, and it tells all about what he endured, how he was able to get much tougher than before and finally, how he meets a human he can really love, john thornton. I don't want to spoil the ending, so you'll have to read to find out what happens in the end! wil he make it back? or will he be willing to stay in the frozen north? it will have some parts where the dogs endure some pretty harsh challenges and cruel humans. you will love it"
4,This book teaches so much...,"I read this book over and over as a child and after reading it again this past week, I see so much value in it. A story told from a dog's point of view, it teaches children empathy for animals and that value cannot be overrated. One might make the mistake of thinking that because it is written from the dog's POV, it is trite or cutesy...it's not. It is gritty and realistic, emphasizing how a man's character can often be revealed in the manner he treats animals.A rollicking adventure from start to finish, expect to cry and be overjoyed as you read. I would recommend that you read it before giving it to a child, just to make sure it is age appropriate for their developmental stage."
3,Reading with Tequila,"I remember The Call of the Wild being a perennial book report choice for many students when I was in school. I never selected it and for that I am glad. I don't think it would have held my interest in elementary school as it barely held my interest now. While reading the book, I saw the hard life of a dog through the dog's eyes. It was a decent enough story but I just can't grasp why it's a classic. There was a lot of dog on dog violence and some brutal animal abuse. All in all, it was kind of depressing."
3,Jack London's The Call of the Wild is a book worth reading,"London uses complexity in his phrasing that allows you to feel challenged to think about what you're reading as well as giving you the sensation that you are there. ""Buck rushed at the splintering wood, sinking his teeth into it, surging and wrestling with it."" (London p.5) I like how the reader can picture exactly how Buck's anger is taking him over. This gives the book texture. The Call is definatly not a page turner for the general audience. I believe it appeals to readers who enjoy the 1800's and outdoor setting. London allows the reader to feel the savage behavior of the times. ""No fair play. Once down, that was the end of you."" (London p.9) In some areas, none in particular, it seems the situations drag as if the point is never to be reached. Over all this is an average novel that I think everyone should give a chance."
2,"A well written and descriptive book, but not in my interest","Jack Londons The Call of the Wild, was a very well written book. Although it has great uses of words and phrases, the book didn't grab my attention. I thought the time period follows the book very well. Nothing was too modern. One of my favorite parts of the book was at the end. Buck becomes friends with the other wolves. Before that, Buck and the wolves got into a quarrel. One of the scenes in this novel that I disliked were how much the dogs were traded. Because London did this so much it makes The Call seem like the same things keep happening over and over again. London writes: Francois called Buck to him, threw his arms around him and wept over him. And that was the last of Francios and Perrault. Like other men they passed out of Bucks life for good. (London pg.27). I advise readers who enjoy naturistic adventures, to read this book."
2,"A well written and descriptive book, but not in my interest.","In my opinion The Call of the Wild by Jack London is mediocre. My favorite part of the book is the in depth descriptions. For example, I really like the way that London describes Buck after he had been pulling the sled for awhile. ""His muscles had wasted away to knotty strings, and the flesh pads had disappeared, so that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness.""(London p.38) I also like the way the book is written and how it doesn't drag on forever. I do not like the beginning of the book because i think it is boring and doesn't grab the attention of the reader. I also think that the vocabulary is too tough and overall the novel is a bit confusing. Although personally I do not like, The Call of the Wild, I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys a great adventure."
4,it really grabs your attention!,"Jack Londons Call of the Wild will definately keep you on the edge.This book is an attention grabber that will prevent you from putting the book down. This book teaches you about survival,life in 1897, the gold rush,and life in the Yukon. The book was based on the life of the dogs,specifically Bucks point of view.I believe the way the world is and how people treat eachother today can compare to the story.The part that was my favorite was when John Thorton saved Bucks life on page 41. His words were ""If you strike that dog again ill kill you""I automatically thought of John as my favorite character.Ihighly reccomend this book to anyone who wants to read an excellent story that you wont want to put down."
3,"beautiful first go, hollow the next","though this story is a wonderful book (and i do recommend it is read), i have to say i found it lacking the depth needed to make it worth reading even a second time. any truly good book should be treasured and enjoyed a thousand times, but i found that in reading it again it lacked the quality of plot and character development to justify another reading. instead, i suggest to anyone to read it once and savour the memory, because that's as good as it gets."
4,Call Of The Wild review,"This book is about a dog named Buck that is pulled awayfrom his nice laid back life, and thrown into work to become a sled dog. While Buck is becomeing a sled dog he is sold to many different people with many different attitudes towards Buck. Some of these people are nice to him, and some are not. Buck also finds that it is very hard to become a sled dog, and to get along with the other dogs. Although its is very hard to become a sled dog, Buck does it, and becomes one of the best. I think this book was a very good one, and I also think you should read it!"
3,This was a sad book of abuse.,"In my opinion, ""The Call of The Wild"", is an okay book, for people who like to read novels about animals being beaten. I know everything in the end turned out okay, but I still don't think Buck shouldn't have had to go through that. Buck would have had a fine life at the ranch before he was doggknapped by Mannuel. The first time Buck was abused was when Mannuel handed him over to the other man and said ""Twist it, an' you'll choke 'm plentee."" (London page3). That was awful. Another reason I didn't like this book is because of the time period it was uninteresting. The speech was also hard to understand. I wouldn't reccomend this book to little kids or animal loving people like me, maybe to someone who wants to learn about history, death, and hard times of the Yukon."
2,"The call of the wild has some good parts, as well as bad!","I think The Call Of The Wild was a decent book. It had some positives and some negatives. Some positives about the book I liked was the description he used. he described the characters very well, as well as the senery too. Also i like how he made the dogs out to be just like humans. Some negatives about the book I didnt like very well was that the book was not very interesting! It needed some kind of spark or something else added to it to spice it up a little bit. Also it lacked action, there was some action but not enough that made me want to keep reading the book. One quote Jack London used in my mind, that i liked is ""Dat Zpitz fight lak hell, but that Buck fight lak two hells!"" I like this quote and it stands out in my mind because it shows some dominance Buck has in the book. It also shows that buck is the rightful leader of the pack! These are some things that i like and dislike about The Call Of The Wild."
4,this is one of the most interesting books i have ever read.,"I thought that the story call of the wild was an interesting story. I thought it was interesting because there was fighting and violence and i like those kind of things. I liked the man in the red sweater when he said ""I'll put you in your place"" because it's violence. I liked when the dogs fell in the frozen river because when he explained how it happend I could see it in my head and could emagine that happening. I think over all it was a very GOOD BOOK."
3,this is a book for adults rather than children,"Jack London's The Call of the Wild is a story about survival. The time period gave it a boring atmosphere,though. Some parts kept the reader interested and others seemed to drag on. I really liked the part where Buck killed the rabbit,it kept the reader alert. Chapter 4,""Who Has Won Mastership"",seemed to drag on. The vocabulary is difficult,I wouldn't reccommend this book to elementary or middle school students. I don't think they'd understand such sentences as,""The ghostly winter silence had given way to the great spring murmur of awakening life."" (London p.39). Another thing I didn't like was that the human characters were so boring. There wasn't enough conversation. Overall it had a great plot and beautiful ending."
2,"The call of the wild was a boring, pointless book.","The call of the wild was a boring, pointless book. I had no intrest in it because it was just another book about a boy and his dog. It was a plain old boring family book. It's even stated on page forty-one ""it's my dog."" Said by Hal to John Thornton in a fight over Buck. That quote totally proves the whole boy and his dog theory. I would never recomend this book to anyone. I'm not saying that it is a bad book but it was not a book I could get into and enjoy."
2,I really thought this book needed some spice.,"I thought that THE CALL OF THE WILD by Jack London was a decent book. It was kind of dull and lacked that spice that keeps the reader glued to the book. I did like how descriptive he was in some situations, but this description was also the downfall of this book. I didn't like how he gave the animals human feelings. Like on page 42 when he was talking about Buck. He says ""love, genuine passionate love was his for the first time."" In all, I would only recommend this book to people who have nothing better to read."
2,This book is about a dog who devolves into the primitive.,"Jack London's The Call of the Wild, I think, wasn't that great. It was descriptive, nd the characters did seem real, but I wouldn't recomend it. For one thing, there isn't much dialogue, and when there is, it's not very understandable. For example: ""T'ree vair good dogs. Dat Buck, heem pool lak hell. I tich heem queek as anyting."" Ther are worse, but I could't understand them. Also, I don't like the way that all of the characters died (or left without return) except Buck. I don't think that the main character should miraculously live through everything, just because he's the main character. That is wht I think about Jack London's The Call of the Wild."
1,"""Not a Childrens Book""","This book, about a dog being terribly mistreated throughout the story, should come with a warning label. Some of the more graphic computer games are not as descriptive as the treatment that the good natured dog, Buck, receives from most of his owners throughout his travels. Finally, the one owner who saves his life and gives him love dies at the hands of the Indians! Not a fun book to put down at one in the morning without another good book to pick you up. This book probably should not be advertised for children under age fourteen."
1,Buyer Beware!,"If you would like a computer to read this book to you, this would be the book for you to purchase. A dollar tossed in the trash!"
3,textbook,"product was recieved when specified, in the condition expected and was exactly what I wanted. Haven't been able to read it yet it's for class I will be starting in august."
2,At least it was short,This is a very boring book. Dogs get beat every page. Jack London thinks he knows everything about wolves. NOT!! HORRIBLE!
1,"The Call of the Wild was a good, descriptive book.","In my opinion The Call of the Wild by Jack London was a good book. Jack was very descriptive; he made the novel come alive and he kept me reading. Though, there were certain sections I didn't care for, such as the beatings of the dogs and John Thornton's death. Also the characters Mercedes, Hal, and Charles were very annoying, and it seemed unrealistic when they made it so far acting the way they did. The quote ""I spik true w'en I say dat Buck two devils,"" (page 25) shows that Buck was a strong fierce fighter and what the language they spoke back then was like. I found the colloquial languages easy to comprehend. I suggest this novel to all younge adults eager to learn what life was like in 1897. Again I enjoyed The Call of the Wild and would like to read more books like it."
2,A bad book,This book was one of the worst books i have ever read. It was boring and pointless. Irt was bad i didn't like it. i had to read it as an assignment. i hated it. it was not groovy. it was ungroovy.
5,Klondike Gold Rush Becomes Heartfelt,"I am not one for most classical literature, but after being required to read Jack London's ""The Call of the Wild"" in an 8th grade language arts class, I cannot wait to read more books written in a similar style. London's choice of words and realist/naturalist style of writting are very interesting, even for me as a 14 year old. Buck has become one of those ""close"" characters in terms of reading, though the story itself is more depressing than not.In my class, we were required to annotate the text, which personally made it easier to connect with the characters and harder to part with them. In this set up, that is a good thing.I was hesitant to read this book even though I had to, but now I'm glad I broadened my horizons a bit more. For the teachers out there, this is a story that I bet your students will truly enjoy. I know I did. :-)"
4,Good but a little slow.,This book was used for my book report and I thought it was good. If you liked this I would also recommend other books by Jack London!
2,You have to be a dog fan,"I couldn't get into this and I didn't finish the novel. Unless you are a dog owner and love the animals, I would say this is not going to be very interesting."
3,The call of the wild,A great book for young and advanced readers. I really enjoyed it. One of the best books I have ever read.
2,Expected it to last a little longer,"I purchased my upright about 2 years ago and while it continues to have good suction and cleans fairly well, I'm disappointed that it has already developed a short in the switch area which has melted the handle and renders it unuseable for fear of a fire. Online research reveals that others have also had this problem. While it is probably fixable, I'm not in love enough with the sweeper to keep it. It does not lay flat enough to clean under tables, and the on board hose and tools have a habit of falling off at inconvenient times. The other inconvenience has been finding replacement bags anywhere but online."
1,Hate this vaccum!,"Owned this product for a couple of years now and have had nothing but headaches. It clogs frequently. It rarely fills a bag, so I know it is not picking up. The furniture attatchment sucks up the fabric and does not clean. It is heavy and bulky and very hard to control. Also, after only a few months the plastic piece that lock the vac into the sandup position broke. This vaccum is not worth your money!!"
2,Don't let the name 'Electrolux' fool you,"To our dismay, after we bought the Electrolux Aptitude, we found out it doesn't perform as well as other Electrolux vacuums. The reason - Electrolux bought out Eureka and are marketing the Aptitude Vacuum with their name on it!How did we find this out? We could NOT buy the belt or bag at the store we bought the Electrolux at because it is NOT a true Electrolux product. It's a Eureka with an Electrolux name.Save yourself the journey and either buy a more expensive model of Electrolux or a less expensive vacuum in another brand. This vacuum is NOT worth the price!"
1,Do not waste your time and money.,"This is really sucks item.Before I bought this, I used a LG vaccum.Compare to 10year old LG, This vaccum is a really shameful one.Do not waste your time and money.I bet!"
2,Too hot to handle!,"This isn't the worst vacuum I've owned. It did its job well for less than two years. Then the plastic at base of the handle/neck became extremely hot to the touch and eventually melted. It's not safe to use anymore.At nearly $300, there are better vacs out there that cost less money. After this guy melted, I checked Consumer Reports and found they highly recommended the Eureka Boss ""SmartVac"" (Eureka and Electrolux are owned by same company.) I spent around $150 for this machine and it's been awesome."
4,Great vacuum for the price,"I bought this product to replace a Hoover Bagless Vacuum that I purchased four years ago for around $400. The Hoover model was no longer working very well & the allure of a bagless vacuum had definitely worn off. My parents have owned Electrolux products for years & have always been happy with their quality. When I saw the Aptitude at such a low price, I was a little skeptical. The old saying you get what you pay for. The Aptitude is plastic. However, so was the Hoover I had purchased four years earlier. Does the Aptitude compare to the Electrolux models of the past? No. However, I didn't pay the $600 price tag that my parents did either. In my opinion the Aptitude works great, especially for the $250 price. If you're looking for a good vacuum cleaner in this price range, the Aptitude is definitely the one."
1,What a Rip-Off,"I first, i thought i was getting a ""True Electrolux"" for a bargin price. The old saying ""you get what you pay for"" is oh so true. As it turns out, this is a cheap Eureka vacuum cleaner. First time i tryed to clean under a chair, i discovered the brush head lifts off the floor completely. Forget cleaning under a bed. It's noisy, looks like cheaper tthan normal plastic parts. It also left scuff marks all over my wood flooring. I could get the same vacuum cleaner but branded Eureka for a lot less money if thats what i wanted. For me, it's going back for a refund. My advise, stay away from this product. If it is an Electrolux you want (as i do) then be sure you buy the real item. Don't know why, but the real Electrolux is now called Aerus or something like that. Same great products but a different name now.My 3 cents worth,"
4,awsome,"Great product !!! At first when you get it the gloves feel wide and big on your hand but you get used to it, I felt I was not going to like them and than I never took them off."
5,Warms the Heart,"As I read through the stories in ""Seeing Beyond the Wrinkles,"" my heart was warmed. I work in a nursing home, and this book reminded me of all of the special people I have met throughout my career. ""Seeing Beyond the Wrinkles"" gave me an even greater appreciation of the population I serve everyday. They have stories to tell about their lives - they aren't just ""Room 342, Bed 2."" Tindell truly has an understanding of the aging spirit. ""SBtW"" is a fantastic find."
5,Il Ladro di Bambini,"When I first saw this movie in the theater, the plot and the acting was stupendous. It remained engraved in my brain for this long and as another reviewer states, it should be converted from VHS format to DVD so many others can purchase/view it. It is well worth it. Questo film merita essere convertito in DVD, così chiunque potrà vederlo e apprezzarlo. Mi è rimasto in mente da quando l'ho visto al cinema (cosa che non mi succede spesso!). Vale la pena vederlo."
5,"Powerful humanist film, shockingly unknown in the US,","Terribly sad Italian neo-realist tale of a young cop assigned to escort a young, abused brother and sister across country to an orphanage, and the bond that grows between them, with unexpected results.Perhaps a bit manipulative in the middle (the damaged kids respond a little too quickly to the cop's kindness), and the lead actor has his awkward moments along with some very strong ones (all three leads were non-professional actors).But the two kids are remarkable for their ages, and the uncompromised honesty of the ending makes up for a few convenient twists, and `easy' transitions. Overall a powerful and moving film full of humanity. It's shocking and sad to think this award winning modern Italian classic is essentially unknown, and unavailable on video in the United States."
5,An Award winning video that needs to be released on dvd,I was fortunate enough to have seen this movie on a cable network and recorded it on VHS. It is a shame that such an award winning movie has not yet been released on DVD. I would purchase it immediately. I am thrilled that I have it on VHS (for viewing at a later time as they say) and am thrilled to have it in my collection
3,A diary?,"If you are VERY new to eastern thought or one who wants someone to break things down for you to the 'nth degree, this could work for you. For everyone else there is one not-too-basic anaylsis and about an additional 10% which seemed insightful. Sorry, I think this was probably someones reading diary and a good one at that; however, it was too basic too fit my needs even for easy reading."
5,Superb and thorough introduction to woodturning.,"As a beginning turner, I really appreciate both the clarity of the discussion and the detail with which tool technique is discussed. I think this is the best single introduction to turning on the market. Really superb."
1,DON'T PURCHASE THIS DVD!,"This DVD (and it's first volume) are absolutely unacceptable as anything other than complete trash. What a disappointment! For starters, the video and sound quality are horrible! It honestly looks worse than a VHS video. (No joke here.) There are noticeable glitches, it looks and sounds as if someone was adjusting the tracking on a VCR as this was being transferred to DVD! Most of the videos have obvious edits and skips in them, and most (95%) of the songs have the beginnings cut-off (mid-lyric) and the ends just chopped. I don't believe one video is complete. Some videos are so washed-out it's ridiculous. There are NO extras at all, nor are there any credits or record company recognitions listed. Please don't waste your time on this thing. Unbelievable!"
1,The worst DVD I've ever seen,"Like any big 80's music fan, I was thrilled when I saw this DVD. Of course, I bought it right away, drove home, and sat down to watch. I quickly realized 30 seconds into the DVD that I made a big mistake. I could record these videos on my VCR with better quality and transition--almost anyone could. Please save your money and treat yourself to a couple pizzas--they will be much more satisfying and last a lot longer than this DVD."
1,Sub-VHS quality,"The videos look like someone dubbed a video, then digitized the result. There's actually a video hiccup at least one of the videos. These were apparently originally broadcast on something called ""That Teen Show"". Sound and video quality are poor, and the beginnings and ends of many songs are cut off.On the other hand, there are several songs here that are hard or impossible to find on video anywhere else."
4,The Brassknuckles,"Well, the only reason I got this CD was to have the Brassknuckles song on there. They were a band from the Boston area and I liked them, but they never had an EP or anything.(They broke about a year ago.) I found out that this is the only album theyre on. After getting it...I found that ALL the bands on here are good. Its a must for and street punks or skinheads."
4,FACE VALUE,"You've got to take this recording at face value. What you hear is what you get. If you want the perfect dance record, stick with (or desperately try to find) Baby Ford's Bford 9 (1992) or Jam and Spoon's 1994 release Tripomatic Fairytales (that's 2001 AND 2002, folks), or for the more adventurous, Final Cut's Consumed CD(1992). If Lefitsm was never recorded, everyone would go gaga over Leftield's R+S. It's an extremely impressive follow-up CD, and my only personal gripes are the seemingly commercially-motivated singles, Phat Planet and Afrika Shox, which completely disrupt the ominous tone and overall continutity of the CD. Use your CD-program button to skip these sub-par tunes and you've got a great listen."
4,rhythm infection bliss,"I bought this before the Leftism one and actually prefer it. When it hits the speakers I pull out my djembe african drum and don't stop playing along until the very end, drenched in sweat!"
2,Hope you like reggae,"Hope you like reggae. I bought this CD because I was linked to it from an underworld purchase - you know - ""people who bought this cd also bought..."". Well, I happen to dislike the junky sloppy flavor of reggae - it is actually appaling. I like clean, precise, flowing sounds. I could see how some would like some of the more trancy songs on the CD, but the reggae mixed between - ruins it for me."
3,a little bit funky gut not too fresh,"I haven't heard Leftfield's first album ""Leftism"" yet, so I can't really compare it. So all I can say is this is a decent dance album. It is a mix of techno and british hip hop, which is a good thing I think. Some of the other reviews have stated that many songs are boring and repetative. I agree with that somewhat. There are some pretty good, funky beats in most of the songs. I'm sure that if you already have ""Leftism"" then you will be disappointed with this one as everybody else is. It's a good album to just kick back and relax to or when you're just cruising around."
4,Pretty good sequel,"Having reached the dizzy heights of Leftism (which was an absolute classic), Leftfield were already billed as a one hit wonder. However, Rhythm and Stealth continued on a lot of the good work that was started before. Phat Planet and Afrika Shox were the 2 tracks that really stood out. Even though this album is not nearly as good as its predecessor, it is well worth a try."
2,Not the epic that Leftism is,"So it's taken 4 years to produce this...???? Somehow, I don't think so.Big beats? Yes, and they are infectious. But it has none of the enchantment that Leftism had. It sounds like Leftfield just put their sequencer into automatic. Even the sounds are nothing new, and I can hear samples from the Leftism remixes.Buy this CD if you're a DJ looking for muzak fillers. If you're looking for a CD that demonstrates all that's innovative about British music, this ain't it.Sorry guys, but the wait wasn't worth it."
4,a brave move,"Like a lot of people, I've been looking forward to this album for years. When I first heard it, I was disappointed. But now, I think it's a very brave follow-up to a classic. They could've just made a 'Leftism Part 2', but instead they've made a fine album which stands up well on its own merits. Some of their best work is on this - 'Dusted' in particular is excellent. I think people probably have a problem with the mood of the album - it veers from the laid back 'El Cid' to the pounding, agressive 'Double Flash'.Overall, it's a superb album from an innovative band. Can't wait for the next one!"
2,"Compared to the first release, this is simply boring",I'm sorry to spoil the other reviews but when compared to the first release this is simply boring electronic music with no real new ideas. Listen to the first release if you're interested in Leftfield
2,middle of nowhere,"not dance, not trance, not experimental, not the combo of the above. you can buy it, but you have have little fun with it. only track #3 is enlightening"
2,Phat?,"Fresh sound effects drive this album, from the lush synths of El Cid to the guitar freakout on Phat Planet. That being said, most of the tracks sound like their energy is threatening to burst from the rigid framework they are written in. I suppose dance music isn't about writing songs, but dance-albums really ought to be. In fact, there are a few dance albums that are. Beaucoup Fish, Risotto, Movement in Still Life... Those three albums alone make this particular effort look just rather weak. High production value, yes, it sounds pretty. But pretty what?"
5,RHYTHM & STEALTH,"R&S is an extremely varied and well rounded record.I think that it is way better than the first (and overrated) Leftfield cd, LEFTISM. If you are new to the genre, or a longtime fan of DJ music, than R&S is a good choice.Prime cuts include Afrika Shox,Double Flash,and Swords. I also reccomend Lionrock's ""An Instinct For Detection"""
4,A breath of fresh air...,"In a sea of sameness, Leftfield deliver something that's very listenable, but has a lot of texture and subtlety. If you're bored with your last few techno CDs try this one."
2,Disappointing,"I sure hope that first review I saw was accurate, because I just finished listening to it for the 1rst time and I am really disappointed. I only like 3 tracks on it, I don't think it has the rythems that LEFTISM had, in fact most of the rythems and drum lines a mundane or just don't spark any interest, and I kinda wish I hadn't bought the CD. Sure hope it changes next time I listen to it."
2,"Oh dear, what a shame","Well, after four+ years of waiting for the sequel, I have to admit nothing but disappointment. It sounds like recordings I bought 4 years ago and didn't like. Where's the energy of 'Open Up'? Afrikaa Bambaata makes the only worthwhile contribution as far as I'm concerned. The Guinness advert music works only as advert music. I shall go back to Moby and the Chemical Brothers."
1,Rhythm & Stealth,I would love to give a review of this Cd but after purchasing it I was told they the seller didn't have it after all & my money was refunded.Very confused why someone would offer things for sale that they don't actually have.
5,Spy Fox in Dry Cereal,"My 6 year old loves this game and has for almost a year now. He really enjoys the puzzles and the fact that each time you play the game, it is not the same. When we first got it it took him several weeks to solve all the puzzles so I felt like we'd gotten our money's worth. Educationally, it's great due to all the problem solving and the go fish game. The best game for this age range!"
5,Build Teams,"(Full disclosure: this book contains a copy of the FunStandard.org which I maintain.) This book should be required reading for anyone thinking of managing or leading people, covering all the things you need to do to succeed, or, in other words, all of the things managers so often don't think about resulting in unnecessary failure. I particularly liked the chapter on building teams, providing a framework for doing so to avoid a mistake that often dooms projects before the first meeting is even held -- haphazard assembly of individuals, mistaking ""organization chart"" for ""team"". This book's distilled wisdom will make you a better manager in a very short time."
5,Eyeopener,"I absolutly liked this book!The author did a great job explaining what to do and HOW to do it.It improved my own skills to train and guide employees on an individual basis. And that was beneficial to the whole company.I highly recommend this book for anyone in a position of leadership, management and even employees with a vision."
1,dangerously sharp,"This feeder says rolled edges for safety. im not sure what that means. its crazy sharp, you could cut a tree down with this thing. I sliced my finger open sliding it open to fill it up. After a couple of days using it, i noticed my quail with some serious injuries to their feet. Turns out they hop up on top of it to eat and their feet slip inside of the holes, when they jump out, it slices their feet. Half of my quail have very nasty cuts on their feet. Two were down to the bone, and one actually amputated a toe. I would strongly advise a different product. We are lucky we did not lose any to infection."
5,Best Ever!,"Elaine Paige on her albums is like listening to her in person on stage. Exciting, clear and deeply felt. Her voice is a pleasant change from Streisand or Beechman. Her depth in voice tones and versatility must be just a few of the reasons why she was chosen and was such a dramatic addition to the cast of ""Sunset Strip"" Bravo Elaine!"
2,Approach with caution Queen fans,"Elaine Paige, famous stage star (""Evita"", ""Cats"") was urged by her then (and possibly still) boyfriend Tim Rice (part of the legendary musical team with Andrew Lloyd Webber) to record an album entirely of Queen songs!Obviously she stayed close to her roots by not choosing any of their harder rock tracks and instead went with the lighter side.Her light and airy voice is well suited for the classic ""Love of My Life"" and ""One Year of Love"".Naturally, there were some mistakes. Her take on ""A Kind of Magic"" is the worst kind of lite-FM pop complete with saxophone. Ugh.The highlight is ""Radio Ga Ga"" in which she added actual bits from BBC radio giving it a true nostalgic feel (which was what the song is all about.)A fairly good album...if you like late 80's adult contemporary music."
1,Lack of Effort,This CD is a lackluster attempt at music. Many of the songs are cheap answers to the worlds problems.
4,You may want to listen to this album during the day,"The first time I heard this album was late at night. Alone. In my dark apartment. Somewhere in the middle of ""Grin"" I became filled with such an intense fear of my surroundings that I had to turn it off. It was amazing. Check it out."
5,Silly Amazon Crap,"Dreamed of languid moments with my lawn mower belt, have it wrapped around the bed post. Shipped on time, arrived on time what more can you ask of a simple belt."
3,Cheap but decent,"You get what you pay for with this watch. It's a pretty good deal, but with in the first week of wearing it one of the stones fell out."
1,Not recommended - Predictable and boring.,"I don't like to write bad reviews especially considering this is probably Ms. Stocker's passion but I would not suggest purchasing this book.After spending many a vacation in P-Town I was really looking forward to this read, but instead found a predictable drawn out storyline. The story revolved around having a drink every waking moment, constant cattiness, predictable hookups, and boring conversations. This may sound like interesting drama, but it wasn't. If it is at all possible to make drama drab, this book has accomplished such a thing. It just didn't seem real in any sense and that was not a good thing.Bottom line, I would not recommend buying this book. It's not as fun as you think it should/could be."
1,God Awful Book,Why this book was published is beyond me. I could only read up to page 44. I am a bibliophile and NEVER throw out books - this one made the cut and down the dumpster it went as it took up space on my bookshelves that I reserve for well written work.
2,"Average women, average vacation = dull reading",If you like stereotypical pseudo romance with a lesbian twist this might be a novel for you. The descriptions of Providence are certainly full but the plot and characters get repetitive very quickly. I never got invested enough to care about Claire and Rita or Kit and Sabi to wonder if someone might cheat or with whom. I also didn't care much when their straight friend Diane experiences some orientation confusion. Everything in this story just seemed to be surface level with minor attempts to dig deeper that just are not enough to keep me interested.
2,poems the drag,This book of poetry drags. Maybe its the conversion into English that causes this effect but I had a tough time goetting thru this work.
3,Just ok,"I've had it for 2 months now, but now the lid handle gets hot. My other pots I could always pick up the lid anytime to check how things are going, this one I have to get an oven mitt to use. To me the most important thing about a pot is a cool handle, which this has, but I didn't expect for the lid handle to get hot.The outside finish does start to look ugly after a couple uses. I bought the Calphalon copper cleaner but I can tell that one tub of it will go by very quickly because you need a lot of the product to clean the whole pot. There's really a huge difference from when it's cleaned and when it's not.It is really pretty when clean though."
3,It's OK,"This pan works fine. It heats evenly and looks good if maitained. A single cooking discolors it to an unattractive grayish orange. This is unlike other thicker finished copper pans I own which very gradually tarnish and require only occasional polishing. This pan's finish can be easily restored by wiping it with a mixture of white vinegar and salt, but it is an inconvenience to do it every time you use the pan."
1,laughable,"Well, first off, this book might have been useful if you knew absolutely NOTHING about the Internet a few years back, but in today's environment it strikes me as just plain clueless. It is more or less designed to teach people how to fake their way through an interview and fool people into thinking that they actually have some idea of what they're talking about. Of course any interviewer worth their salt will be able to see right through some idiot trying to use buzzwords to look smart. I get no sense that the authors have actually ever had any success in any industry involving the Internet. I'd be amazed if they actually were able to parlay these ""skills"" into a real Internet related job and even more shocked if they were able to hold those jobs for more than a month. Hopefully they've been weeded out during the recent economic downturn and will have a chance to see just how useless their ideas are in an economy that isn't hiring anyone with a pulse"
1,"those who can't, teach","and those who can't teach, write books about the internet.you'd be better served with release 2.1 by esther dyson or check out some theodore geisel. at least the nonsense in his books isn't masquerading as business advice."
1,You've got to be kidding!,Talk about someone with absolutely no clue. There is so much bull in this book that you'd be better served using this in your garden as fertilizer.
5,Comprehensive and Comprehensible,"An excellent analysis of the Internet industry, job market, and figuring out what is right for you. Takes out a lot of the mystique and tells you what really to expect if you ever land the job that you think from the outside is a dream. Also good to determine whether your skills make you conducive to working in the industry and various positions in the industry. It's a really big book filled with quality and a real steal..."
1,Bad Design of the Lids,"The new look of the Contemporary Series is attractive but not durable for long wear.The underside of the lids have a black band which I thought at first to be heat resistant plastic of some sort but it turned out to be some kind of paint! I found this out after the paint started to chip off during cleaning! Who did the engineering and testing of this design? Very bad design indeed. And water can be trapped under the metal band of the lids which the black paint band is suppose to hide. What a joke!Also the lid's lip is easily dented if accidently dropped.So in sum, the attractive look of the Contemporary series quickly fades when its vulnerability and durability are factored in. Avoid buying this line and choose the other time tested lines of Calphalon."
4,Beautifully written.,"Monsieur Bonnard is absolutely, utterly adorable! He is wise, witty, imaginative- the embodiement of good- yet totally unaware of it. Anatole France has created an extremely real character, some even say it is Anatole projecting himself into the future as an old man. The work is humorous and sincere. The translation I used was by Lafcadio Hearn and seemed to me one of the better ones."
1,When Will we see the Full Version?,"Until recently, I would have given this video 4 or 5 stars...but from what I understand there is a restored version of this film with long-lost footage. More scenes of the dinosaur in London, Etc. So... hey guys..if this is true, how about getting us the full movie on video?"
1,"Good Golly You Missed, Molly","It looks like Amazon hasn't been paying attention again, as usual!There was only one Lost World released in 1960. Wallace Beery, one of the stars of the 1925 silent classic, DIED 10 years before the Irwin Allen film was made.I would love to have a DVD of this Michael Rennie, Jill St. John, David Hedison, and Claude Rains masterpiece, even if produced by such a schlock company as GoodTimes. But alas, this seems not to be.GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT, AMAZON!!!"
2,The Lost Extras,"This is DVD for Disappointing, Very Disappointing. And Sloppy, too. Very Sloppy. Slingshot gives us a (reasonably) good transfer of a classic and lovely old monster movie, but the supposedly ""Special Collector's Edition"" fails to deliver half of the extras advertised on the back of the DVD. There is no Second Audio Track (Music Only), no in-depth essay by Scott MacQueen, no Ray Harryhausen Letter, no Technical Notes, and no recreation with stills and script excerpts of ""missing scenes"" of the original 10-reel version. What a pity! I'm returning my copy and hoping that someone else releases it with the care and supplements that the movie deserves."
5,The best Lost World easily.,"Out of the three versions of Conan Doyle's masterpiece this is still the best and though the dinosaurs look out-dated now they are far better and more realistic than in the 1960 and 1992 versions.A team of explorers led by the excellently-portrayed Professor Challenger set off to find a plateau in South America where dinosaurs, in isolation from the outside world, have escaped extinction and still live on. They finish up bringing one of the creatures back to London where it escapes and causes havoc. (Both these plots were new ideas back then, and have been ripped off countless times since).Not only a visual treat, this is a piece of cinematic history and is certainly far more watchable than that special-effects-laden bore of the same name. Get hold of a copy of this 1925 classic now!"
2,Lost World,A weak script and tepid direction derail THE LOST WORLD before it has the chance to leave the station.About the only reason to rent this one is for the chance to see a youngish Wallace Beery in a fright wig and Bolshevik beard and a stop-action animated brontosaurus stomping through downtown London. Director Harry Hoyt may have established the tradition of welding a weak story to a special effects spectacle and hoping for the best. Pass this one by unless you're interested in pioneering special effects.
2,A big disappointment,Combines terrible claymation animation with other poorly rendered special effects. Difficult to sit through. The dinosaurs won't convince anyone.
5,A Revolutionary Film for Its Time,"""The Lost World"" was the ""Jurassic Park"" of the silent film age. While the plot of adventureres finding a South American plateau inhabited by dinosaurs may seem far fetched today, just sit back and let suspended disbelief sink in while enjoying a well made picture. There are plenty of dinosaurs and dinosaur confrontations in the atmospheric jungle/volcanic setting. The stop motion animation and even inflatible stomachs (to simulate breathing) gave the creatures a realism unmatched at the time. True, it lacks the modern special effects of ""Jurassic park"" or ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" but viewers should remember just how painstaking the processes that brought these beast ""to life"" were in the 1920s. The film contains a number of memorable scenes from fierce dinosaur battles to a volcanic eruption to a brontosaurs stomping around London. Overall, an enjoyable and revolutionary silent film."
1,not THE sabatier,"alas, i bought this knife set by brand name...thinking 'hey, a good brand for cheap'...well. they are cheap. and they are not 'the' sabatier knives. my set has rust spots after 2 months, and the blade edge dulls in mere days of use. terrible product.sabatier is not a name that can be copyrighted due to old french laws, therefore not *all* sabatier knives are produced by the brand name sabatier we all know and love.dont bother with these, you'll end up like me: a cheap set of rusty knives in the trash and a $25 knife block."
3,Great Value....,"Well as a avid online shopper i read many reviews of products that i am interested in buying people are so negative This set for instance i was so excited to order until i started reading all the bad reviews which now i can proudly say are wrong. Thats right WRONG!! I recived this unblivable set yesterday 09/29/03 and its unblievable... Great knives, Sharp realy sharp look great clean easly nothing bad to report my order came quickly and it was so much more that i ever expected essecially after reading all the bad reviews. If you want chef grade 500.00 dollar knives you must spend 500 dollars If yo want good nice looking knives that regular people can afford you want these. Also for people just staring out what a great inexpenssive gift that they can really use!! Well take it or leave it a deffinate value for ... heck even 100 dollars in my book"
2,HORRIBLE!,"These knives are horrible. I was SO disapointed when I got them. I bought them a couple years ago from Amazon and when I first got them they were NOT sharp. The only thing I do like is that thee handle is actually sturdy. It's not flexible like some of these cheaps knives. Mine knives also rusted in areas. The steak knives are okay. I usually use them and I do used the scissors. If you are looking for really sharp knives, don't waste your money with these."
2,The price says it all,"These knives are very cheaply constructed. Right out of the box one was missing the crest on the end of the knife, others are glued on crooked. They are not sharp and the bread knife tears the bread apart instead of slicing it, and the slicing knife does a much nicer job on my breads. RUST spots appeared the first time washed, now I just throw them into the dishwasher, because they are not the quality I expected.. The handles are comfortable and you get a good grip on them even with wet hands, so that is a good point. Overall I was very disappointed with them, but would recommend to someone that is on a tight budget because you do get a complete set at a very CHEAP price, but if you don't need them immediality do yourself a favor and save up for a better set."
2,don't waste your money,"While I certainly did'nt expect anywhere near the top of the line Sabatier cutlery, I also didn't expect the junk I received in their name. I'm surprized thar Sabatier allowed their name to be associated with this junk.While I appreciate the concept, I will certainly be more cautious before i ever order anything from your company again"
1,Would not want them for free,"This a very bad set of knifes ... I own a similar set of Sabatier Precision, I got them on Amazon ... and I love my set.The ChefStar knives are very light and not sharp at all!! I don't understand how one company could make two products with such a different quality."
1,Poor Quality,"I recently bought this set of knives from Amazon and I have to report that the product is severely overprised even at it's discounted rate. The product looks knives, the weight is right, but regrettably they cut like genuine fast food plastic knives.Avoid this product if you can. Unfortunatly the first of our kids who move out will get these knives. This could categorize us as virtually abusive parents."
2,knives,"I was very disappointed with these knives. While they carry the Sabatier name,they certainly do not have the quality.They do not remain sharp.The kitchen shears are the best item in the set. This is nowhere near the professional quality of Sabatier"
3,Not so Bad.....,"I use mine every day. The edge comes with a factory finish. If you want razor sharp, get a wetstone and go to work or take them to a knife shop who'll put a lifetime finish on them for about $5-$8 a blade. They'll polish them in the finishing process also. The handles are dishwasher proof and the blade tips are stronger than the old Sabatier blades that held a great edge, looked fabulous, but broke tips off if someone else in the family put them in the dishwasher (I have a collection of those). I find the blades are quite a bargain for the price, the wood block and blades are quite attractive and the steak knives are sharp enough for surgery on any piece of meat from shoulder to tenderloin. However, the unpolished stainless requires more cleaning and dryiing than the older Sabatier blades as the unpolished surface can spot. For twenty bucks or so, they're a bargain."
1,Worst knives ever,If you like cutting with poor quality knives that rust within 2 weeks of use....then these knives are for you.
1,sabatier 20 piece,Disgraceful. I have never bought knives that arrive unsharpened. That is the very least you would expect. I returned these.
2,"poorly packaged, rust, and more...","I feel taken. I wish I read these reviews before buying them. The negative ones are true. The box was open like it had been returned, blades outside of box, blades banging against blade during shipment, chipped like crazy. Cheap tab feel off knife, rust on blades...very disappointed."
2,you get what you pay for; or less.,"The knife blades on all the knives look good and sharp. I don't know how long they will had a good edge. The handles are cheap plastic and the little silver end pieces remind me of cheap models I made as a kid. Also one knife arrived with rust already on it and another missing end piece. I found another set of knives at sears for $20 that was the same size but built better. BTW this set was bought as a gift, the sears set will be given instead."
2,Good value BUT !!!,"This set is a good valu for the money. But if you are looking for a good quality set at a cheap price, this set isn't. The small knives are like using saws. The larger ones are not real sharp nor will they hold an edge. All of them will come out of the dishwasher with rust spots. But what do you get for this price?"
1,Don't do it!!!,Complete waste of the little amount of money you pay for them! I didn't even waste the money to ship them back. I threw them out. Just the block was worth saving. But no good without decent knives. These knives are terrible. Can't cut a single thing. The are extremely dull. My knives rusted after the first washing. Spots and stains all over them and they were hand washed and dried. The steak knives just shred at the meat they don't cut it. Like using a grater to cut your steak. Please do not waste your money on these knives. I will never again look at a Sabatier knife they ripped me off once never again. I'll save up more money and buy from better knife company. In the mean time the knives I bought at the local dollar store are working better than Sabatier's
1,Not happy,Bought 2 set. Worst knives I have come across. It's not sharp. I will never recommend this to anyone.
2,Quality below what was expected,"Yes, the price is good for this set I purchased and they are definitely sharp. HOWEVER, before we used them we put them in the dishwasher to be washed. All the knives came out of the dishwasher with RUST on them. We have an excellent dishwasher and no other items we have cleaned have come out of the dishwasher with rust on them. I don't know if it is typical for this brand to be low quality, or if I just got a defective set. I don't have the box any longer to get the address in order to file a complaint, so am looking on the internet for it. If anyone does have the address to the company which produces these, please email me."
2,Pretty-looking crap,"I got these knives on time, but one of them from the set was missing and it was probably sharp one. This set sucks for cutting meat, onions, tomatoes, bread... all the stuff you want to cut cleanly and quickly. Of course I got the set for $20. They MAY be worth that, but definitely not the $2xx.00 they claim here. Buy another set!"
1,How stupid do they think we are?,"I fell for this offer, and sent a set of knives to my daughter-in-law, thinking that I had gotten a great deal on a quality item. After I found out, from Sabatier themselves, that there are many different companies producing knife sets under the name Sabatier, I began to understand why her knives rusted and discolored, even though she was washing them by hand and drying them immediately. Amazon arranged a replacement, and guess what? Surprise! The new set is no better! We are currently arranging a second-and-final return. How embarrassing to have given a crappy gift! Don't fall for this one!"
3,What you'd expect for a $20 set of knives,"If you're looking for a steal, look somewhere else.The knives are okay... the only real use I get out of them is the steak knives. For $20, they aren't bad. I purchased a high quality chef's knife to substitute for the one included.Certainly *not* at $300 set."
3,Learn the ways of the garou.,"This is an excellent sourcebook for any devoted werewolf player. It is the silver record printed for you.... tales of heroism and foolishness from the best and worst of the garou. The greatest in character deeds are recorded lovingly in this little book. It also helpfully gives a full list of the pictograms of the garou nation, which is usefull for creating realism in games.This book is not a rule book, but a resource to allow you to understand the way the garou honour their heros. It is also a very intresting read. If you love werewolf, this is a great book for you."
5,Masterpiece!,This gets better and better the more I play it. It IS as good as Dylan. This guy is as cult as they get. Cool. Gritty. No nonsense. Moving. Hard hitting. Tender. Profound. He'll be a star when he's dead!
4,A good partner of a course of linguistics,"I love linguistics and I knew this book for a long time. This book can't be found in China easily. After I read it I understood the reason. The exercise book is so useful but doesn't have much content. A quite big part of it is white paper. Hehe, in general, I like it."
5,So glad to find this!!!,I first tasted this tea at the Russian Tea Room in NYC. I loved it then and have looked for it ever since. Bought this as a gift and hope the recipient shares my taste.Add orange peel and dried cherries to the cup for the ultimate experience.
1,doll house,Only dissapointment was that it did not come with all the furniture pictured on the box. My daughter was not happy on Christmas day when the furniture was not there.
3,no furniture,"I was very disappotinted to see that the house didnt come with furniture other than a crib, swing and kitchen table and 2 chairs. The other disaapointment is that I am unable to find or purchase any fruniture for the rooms by Loving and Learning by fisher price. It is not available anymore except for kitchen sets (which already come with this house) and baby furniture (which includes another crib). We have another dollhouse that our child loves much more!"
3,FUN BUT FURNITURE TOO LARGE FOR TINY ROOMS,Granddaughter loves her pink dollhouse but rooms are too small to even fit a whole room of the FishPrice furn in them. It becomes too frustrating to try to arrange bulky furn. into tiny rooms so she spills out onto the floor and uses the dollhouse mostly as a backdrop. I am going to refurbish my daughter's wooden dollhouse which has full sized rooms. The half sized rooms of the fisher price doll house are useless.
4,I think this is a good toy.....,My daughter received this as a Christmas gift when she was 3yrs old. It did not come with many accessories...but since I knew that she was getting it as a gift-I bought the extras for her as the rest of her Christmas. She is almost 5 now and still loves to play with it (it has held up well!). Even the older neighbor girls come over and play with the doll house for hours at a time. Each year at Christmas I try to get her a new item to add to the doll house. This is a toy that I would like to hang on to for a long time.
1,its awesome,"i got the classic dollhouse for christmas 2004.at first the rooms were too small but after a while i worked out were each set fited.and you dont have too put a set together.you can mix and match.were i live,australia it is very hard to get furniture or any fisher price for girls.so we shop online. but this house is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,price-loving class dollhouse twins,"the rooms are too small to fit the furniture in..I bought the folding doll house for my granddaughters & I had to check it out! The middle rooms are a good size but the sides rooms are not! Look I'm 60+ years old; I had a doll house of metal which I enjoyed playing with as a child; it did not collapse; the house was fully furnished for each room; kitchen, dining room, living room, BEDROOM, bathroom, nursey & little people (dad, mom, brother, sister, & baby). This was my Treasure; I had it until I was grown. Unfortunely my mother let my nephews & niece play with my Treasurer & destoried all that I had collected over the years. I would love to be a TESTER OF TOYS; I have three granddaugters which a hard on toys...I don't believe this little doll house will withstand their handling."
4,Pretty crystal,"Very pretty, although the blue is much darker than appears online. If you're looking for rainbows, the darker crystals don't give as much.Good value for price."
3,Crystal Blue Ball,I was expecting this to be a light blue ball which shows in the pix. Instead I received a dark blue crystal balls. They worked but not what I expected.
4,great book,i used this for my third graders book report and it was very informational and interesting.
3,looks good - sounds bad,"This air purifier looks good and I suppose gets the job done but it sounds like a 20 year old device ready to break down. Rather than just a smooth ""fan"" sound when running, it reminds me of the engine sound of a Ford Pinto compared to a Porsche 911. Not loud - just an unpleasant, irritating sound. I wish I knew if this was the normal sound it's supposed to make."
2,Should be a crime to call this quiet,"It works fine at cleaning the air, but it sounds like a lawnmower even on the lowest setting. It's okay to leave it on the timer when I leave for work, but I couldn't sleep with this on, in a different room on a different floor. Not recommended."
5,Small and Wonderful,"I really just want to give this a five star rating. All the good things everyone said in their review I find to be true. It is small enough not to be noticed and even if it does get noticed, the unit is designed well enough not to be an eyesore."
3,Decent,"This unit was bigger than I expected it to be, and not as quiet as I thought it would be either. It's not loud, but on medium to high settings you can clearly hear the motor going, I can only sleep easily with it on the lowest setting.As for clearing the air, it does that decently well. Doesn't do too much as far as trapping dust, but it does remove a lot of airborne allergens. I noticed a week after buying this that I breathed a bit easier and my sinuses were more clear in my room than it was outside or in other people's houses.For the price, it works well enough. You can probably buy a better one at a more expensive price."
1,Ionizer,"My bf and I bought this air filter specifically for the fact we both have asthma and wanted a nice air filter that not only cleaned the air, but would not create ozone. No where in the reviews did it say that it was an ionizer so we bought it. We had it on for one night, it did a great job cleaning the air and was quiet but when I went to go break down the packaging, I noticed teeny tiny print on the bottom of the box that said: warning: includes ionizer that produces ozone. do not use if you have asthma.We were both quite upset that we didn't see this warning on Amazon before we bought it. Had to return it! False advertising!"
3,"No so quiet, but works","I don't know what other people talked about ""so quiet"". It is not quiet at all. It has three speed settings, even at the lowest speed, it is loud enough to be heard anywhere in our 2000 sqft living room. On its highest speed, you can not have a conversation near it. Of course, we get used to Sharper Image's totally silent air filter.On the positive side, it does push a lot of air through it, even at the lowest speed. A lot of air compared to the Sharper Image's product.This product has 5 years warranty, and the filter should not need to be replaced (wash needed from time to time).This unit has no ionizer, which is the main reason I brought it, trying to see if that help the sensitive noses. But don't believe those who said this unit is quiet, those comments fooled me....."
1,Honeywell Purifier,I am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it!! The purifier I previously had was like walking out into fresh air (even living with a smoker). It is bad walking into my home now. And the area covered with this one isn't that large. I SHOULD HAVE PAID MORE FOR WHAT I HAD BEFORE AND NOT WASTED THE MONEY ON THIS.
1,HONEYWELL HFD-110 HFD-010,HI everyone just a quick comment so no one else gets burned like i did.I purchased the hfd-110 about 6 months ago along with the hfd-010.I spent alot of time researching hepa filters.I did not want a ionising unit due to the negative heath feed back they get.Today i started to try and take mine apart to try and fix the unit because the fans started to make noise and ive now found out that it is a ion/hepa filter.So after all the reading i still was tricked and i have a $200 paper weight.Shame on you honeywell ive always had faith in your products.
4,Decent product for the price,"While the product works well (I have used it for about 30 days now) it was not quite what I expected.What I like...-It really seems to work well and I get that ""clean air"" smell every time.-The tower is fairly large but not difficult to move.What I don't like...-Somehow when I read ""permanent filter"" I thought it was more along the lines of my previous air purifier which had an ionizer plate which was very easy to clean when wiped down with a damp cloth. This one has a filter which actually needs to be removed and cleaned (recommend running under the water in the sink).-It makes more noise than I expected... closer to a fan on low but still not obtrusive."
2,NOISE,The unit is not quiet all the time. Occasionally it sounds like a playing card is flapping against a fan. Other times it runs quietly
4,a good place to start with The Jam,a great British band that never caught on in the USA . . pity . .they were quite good . . . Oasis got a lot of their attitude from the Jam . . .
4,4 stars for the quality of production BUT....,"THIS CONCERT ACTUALLY WAS DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE THE GUYS DRESSED LIKE MONKS LOOKED MORE LIKE DRUIDS THAN MONKLS --AND FOR A 'MONK' TO SING A SONG AIMED AT A WOMAN JUST DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT TO ME IT SEEMED SOOO WEIRD --IF MONKS SING TO A WOMAN OR ABOUT ONE IT WOULD BE TO THE BLESSED MOTHER MARY---I GAVE IT 4 STARS BECAUSE OF THE CASTLE SETTING AND THE OVERALL QUALITY OF PRODUCTION BUT THE SONGS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SPIRITUAL AND THE ROBES SHOULD HAVE LOOKED MORE LIKE A MONKS ROBE AND NOT A BLACK VELVET WHATEVER ----SOME SONGS WERE GOOD LIKE 'BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER' BUT SOME SONGS DIFINITLEY NOT --SOME SONGS THEY COULD HAVE INCLUDED WERE THE BEATLES 'LET IT BE'; AND 'BENEATH MY WINGS' , 'CLIMB EVERY MOUNTAIN' --SONGS WITH A SPIRITUAL SLANT TO THEM --I WAS GOING TO SHOW THIS DVD TO A GROUP OF LADIES BUT NOW I'M NOT SHOWING IT-----"
5,Nice little machine,I wanted an inexpensive radio for my pickup.This one fit the bill. Easy to install and has good sound.
1,Wasted money,This is the worst P. O. S. i have ever purchased. A record player on your front seat would not skip as much as this CD player. Avoid at any cost.
2,Much lower quality than expected,"This unit wrote the book on cheap garbage. The picture is not what you get, there is no bass/treble or even tone control, forget loudness it's not there either. It is 2 channel no front rear, etc. Fully analog, no way to save stations or presets and of course no seek.The mounting hardware is flimsy and would undoubtedly be insufficient in any vehicle application. I put mine in my shop so that doesn't matter.The speakers have perhaps a one ounce magnet, but I suspect even less. The cones are paper, I didn't know they even made automotive speakers from paper anymore. Expect them to rot fast in humid environments. They of course sound very tinny, maybe with a bass or loudness control they would be better.The cd does work I doubt it would play ripped mp3's. The amplifier outputs are rated at 250mV@10% Total harmonic distortion.In short, this product is absolutely not worth the money. Maybe for $15 at a sidewalk vendor?"
3,For the money its ok,"I like the retro look of it but it feels cheap, well it is cheap but it worked in my 1974 super beetle just fine. If your looking for bells and whistles look somewhere else. This is a basic deck for a cheap replacement."
3,when is it NOT stalking? ;),"American-born Katharine and her elderly Aunt Celia are on a tour of England to see it's famous cathedral churches. While visiting the Winchester Cathedral, an architect (Jack Copley) sees the two ladies and is smitten with the lovely Katharine. Of course, in those days you just don't introduce yourself. Luckily for Jack, Katharine drops a copy of their itinerary and he is able to follow the pair from town to town in hopes of getting to know Katharine. It's amazing the lengths Jack is willing to go to in order to be with her.First published in 1893, this is a wonderful short story. Each chapter is titled ""She"" or ""He"" depending on whose perspective it is. There is formatting trouble, however. The preface is right aligned and the main story centered with odd markings for apostrophes and page numbers. If that doesn't bother you, go ahead and read this delightful tale.- posted by Poor Richard's wyfe"
3,She Sells Seashells by the Seashore,"This easy reader book may not be such an easy reader. I have used this book with students in my class and they have found it difficult and confusing to read because of the tongue twisters. I would not recommend this book for first grade students. This book because of it's tongue twister contents must be used with experienced, confident readers. This book uses letter repetition which combines single consonant sounds with blends. For example sea and shell. The s is a single sound and the sh is a blend. The story can be very entertaining for more experienced readers. Students find it funny and like practicing trying to say the tongue twisters out loud. This book could be used as a read aloud with younger children."
1,"BROWN SUGAR, THE MOST DISCUSTING SONG EVER",WOW! WHO LIKES SUCH AWFUL TRASH SONGS LIKE BROWN SUGAR??? THE ROLLING STONES ARE DEFINATELY ONE OF THE WORST BANDS EVER AND THEY HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING DECENT EXCEPT START ME UP AND SHATTERED AND THEY SHOULD BE DISHONORED FOR MAKING SUCH AWFUL MUSIC ALONG WITH QUEEN U2 DOORS AND SABBATH. GET ANY METALLICA ALBUM INSTED.
5,Perhaps the Stones finest album.,"This album is one of the Rolling Stones greatest of all time. ""Beggar's banquet"", ""Let it bleed"" and ""Exile on main st."" are also great. Features many memorable songs (""Brown sugar"", ""Wild horses, ""Can't you hear me knocking"", ""You gotta move"", ""I got the blues"", ""Sister morphine"", ""Dead flowers"" and ""Moonlight mile"" are awesome). Do yourself a favour and buy this classic, I'm sure you won't regret it! Thanks for reading."
5,Wow what a great album!! Review from a new fan in his 20's,"Just getting into the stones myself after being fed up with most of the new music out there. After checking out the Beatles and Pink Floyd the next logical place to look was the Rolling Stones. While it is hard to say which album is better from the magical period('68-'72) I think my ""favorite"" is sticky fingers. An all-time great album in too many ways to even name! My personal favorite songs are Sway, Dead Flowers, and Moonlight Mile. This album is the opposite of an album like Dark Side of the Moon which is why I think I love it so much. Buy this album now.Also yes the remastering isn't very good but it was the only copy they had at the store."
5,The greatest rock n roll band ever,The Stones are totally amazing both on record and live. They seem to go forever. And this is one of their finest. Worth the money just for Brown Sugar & Wild Horses..
4,POSSIBLY THE BEST THEY DID,"YES THE SAME GROUP THAT HAS PUT OUT SO MUCH TRIPE IN THE PAST 25 YEARS ALSO HAD THERE SHINING MOMENTS, AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM. BROWN SUGAR,SWAY, DEAD FLOWERS,WILD HORSES,ITS ALL PRETTY GOOD. THERE IS ONE HORRIBLE MOMENT CALLED YOU GOTTA MOVE, WHY THIS WAS EVER INCLUDED OR EVEN RECORDED FOR THAT MATTER, IS A MYSTERY TO ME.OVERALL,HOWEVER,AS A WHOLE,THIS IS WORTH OWNING."
5,One of the Rolling Stones best efforts ever,A classic and overall stellar representation of the Rolling Stones during a peak period of their history.
2,not as advertised 'good condition',the seller should have disclosed the ink pen scribbles on the inside of the album cover on the underware. no one would buy this item if it was disclosed so i would say I was ripped off.
5,Finger lickin' good.,Keith Richards sells his soul...The Rolling Stones go into Muscle Shoals studio. The rest is history. No need for wordy over analysis by some top 1000 reviewer 'cause any real Stones fan knows you can't put Mick & Keith into words. One of the top 5 albums of all-time...'nuff said.
4,Rock n Roll Classic,"All I have to say is if you buy this album, make sure you listen from beginning to end. Its paced perfect for a rock n roll album.Great Stuff"
5,Very Sticky Fingers,"I am glad to own a version of this album that I can fully appreciate - the remastering is top notch, the vocals are clear the instrumentation can finally be heard.This new remaster is a worthy upgrade and makes this one extra sticky!"
4,Stones,"I like their music, but can't watch Mick sing. This product was very good. In good condition, packaged great, no problems in receiving. Music is great too!"
3,AH... they all sound the same....,"Several Stones albums were on my recommendations pages, and for the life of me, I can't figure out why. I have never been a Stones fan. To me, the only real talent they have is Kieth Richards and even he is VERY limited in what he does on guitar. The rest of the band is what I call ""generic"" - they aren't above average talent wise. Maybe I'm wierd, but Mick Jagger's voice bores me, and watching him grosses me out."
2,Juke Box Heroes,"Along with ""Let it bleed"" and ""Exile of Main Street"", ""Sticky Fingers"" is one of the best Stones albums to come down the pike. If you were disturbed By Juke Box Hero's 1 star review - you need only read his other reviews. 1/100 to 1 star albums are rated at 5 Stars (Metallica and Foreigner) 5 Star albums are rated as 1 star. Obviously, this poor soul is trapped in a parallel universe ... or bizarro world ...Des"
2,What were they thinking?,"OK, Sticky Fingers has some excellent songs on it (Wild Horses, Sister Morphine etc), but then there is the WORST SONG EVER. have YOU read the lyrics to Brown Sugar? Hey, lets combine some of the worst ideas ever... ... into one song! Supposedly its also about cocaine (cant see the references) but that stuff is bad for you. Dont glorify it. Stick to the psychadelics, folks. Its just like pretty much every Stones album, and every Guns N Roses album. You have some amazing songs (YCAGWYW, Paint it Black, Beast of Burden) and some absolutely horrible songs, like Brown Sugar and Midnight Rambler (and of course some downright stupid songs like ""country honk"" and ""miss you"") ... I for one have a burned compilation CD of the best off of Beggars Banquet, Let it Bleed, and Sticky Fingers (to augment High Tides Green Grass and Through the Past Darkly)"
1,Average,Monotonous.Dull.Uninspiring.Unadventurous. What this CD needs is stuff the calibre of All You Need Is Love or Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey.Stuff that sparkles and shimmers. The songs here are just pseudo junky nonsense. More imagination is needed here.If you want halfway decent stones try Hot Rocks which has all the stuff youll ever need.The best of their poppy material such as jumpin jack satisfaction and paint it black.This is as good as they got.Try Imagine or All Things Must Pass instead.
5,a big thumbs up.,"my fingers are tremblin' at the keyboard here. these fellas careers probably ride on my review. I was not suited for this kind of responsibilty over the lives of others. anyway, here goes: great album. buy it if you don't have it. ""moonlight mile;"" one of the great songs of all-time. keith & ron are great nowadays, but i do miss mick taylor. he brought a dimension to this album that is lacking after his departure from the group. so there you go fellas. hope i helped get your careers going a bit. no need to thank me. i should be thanking you. a big thumbs up."
5,One Of The Best,"No Loooong winded review needed. You want Rock n Roll? Fine, You want your moneys worth? Who can blame ya.You want top lyrics, great riffs and cracking vocals? Great! Buy this and satisfy urself."
5,The Stones match The Beatles,"In The Stones versus The Beatles debate, I will always side with The Beatles. However, Sticky Fingers proves to me The Stones were capable of operating on the same level. The album is conceptual and creative. It holds a glimmer of the sixties while infusing 70s blues and straight up rock. I love this album and will never tire of it. Wild Horses is one of the most beautiful songs ever written and Can't You Hear Me Knocking has an incredible guitar riff. Worth the price of admission just for these two songs."
1,"Brilliant album, rubbish re-mastering","Firstly, this album is gold. I love it. This is the Stones during their epic era. There's never been anything in music better than the Stones during the Mick Taylor/Jimmy Miller era. Keef's just got into open tuning and founded his sound. Mick Taylor is amazing. BUT...This remaster is rubbish. Everything's turned up to eleven. There's no nuance, there's no definition. It sounds like a mozquito buzzing in your ear. And this for a band that understood groove better than anyone. This remaster is unlistenably bad. I never listen to this cd because it's such a travesty, a crime. Someone should be prosecuted for such derogatory treatment of an amazing album."
5,unqualified Stones admirer,"While most of us acknowledge that this is definitely one of the greatest Stones albums, I see it as their most IMPORTANT album, as it was the first post-Altamont album, a horrific event that marked the end of the turbulent '60s. How would they respond? Less evil, more rnb, a collection of great songs that also come together as a real album. ""Sway"" just exudes drunken cool, one of my favorite songs ever. And what a bonus!>>one of the best album cover ideas of all time. I wish I had an original lp."
5,Can't Get Unstuck With These Fingers,"Although not as revered as the other albums in the Classic Stones Album Block(the Beggar-Bleed-Fingers-Exile period)SF is in my opinion the greatest Stones album.Not only do we get classics like Brown Sugar and Wild Horses,but we also get Mick Taylor in his first full appearence on album(his miniscule appearence on LIB not counting).Regarded as their greatest second guitar player,they sound like a completely different group.His work on Can You Hear Me Knocking is incredible,especially on the Santana-esque jam at the end.Other great moments on the album include Sway,B#*ch,the Stax-esque I've Got The Blues,and the chilling Sister Morphine.Although tagged as a substance influence album,the final track Moonlight Mile,a beautiful open-ended coda shines a ray of light and hope on this claustrophobic collection of songs."
1,New Remasters Are Not Worth Hearing....,All I want to say is these new Stones remasters are brittle...washed out...compressed...totally distorted and unlistenable. Do not buy these...stay with your Virgin Records versions...worst I have ever heard. I'm being liberal here folks...it's your money though.
5,just a short mean critique,"Mr Knopper should spend some time reading the booklets that the Stones are always too careful to fill with detailed info about who plays what. Sister Morphine is among the greatest songs of the Stones ever, true, but Mick Taylor DOES NOT play on it, the solo guitar is by Ry Cooder (lately famous with the Buena Vista Social Club project)."
3,fits nice,"good quality and works great, so far has not given me any problems I recommend, should have better packaging recommended"
5,Can't kill it!!!,"My husband and I purchased this toy chest for our daughter when she was about 16 mos. old. It has withstood moving, rambuctious kids, you name it. You can't kill it. It will hold up for years to come."
3,We love it!,We absolutely love the size and durability of this toy box. My son loves the shelf too; he place his favorite toys for the week on the shelf. We purchased this shortly after his first birthday. I love that it has matching accessories and is in neutral colors. It is now in our downstairs family room and doesn't stand out with bright primary colors. Great product!
4,Great toy box,"This toy box works great. My daughter can get things in and out most of the time on her own. (She is 19 months old) You can put toys on top as well. One down fall, my daughter has just realized that she can climb on it and into it. It is a safe toy box in that she can't lock herself in it, but not so safe if she is standing on top of it. We keep a close eye on her, so it shouldn't be a problem."
5,Holds more than you think,My 18 month old son had so many toys I had run out of creative places to store them all. This toy box holds more than it looks (of course it could always be slightly larger). I was able to get about 75% of all his toys into it and still have room for him to get things out by himself. He can't climb on it yet - though he has tried. The price is better than if you went to the step 2 web site and I couldn't beat the free supersavers shipping. It also arrive much faster than predicted. I am a very happy Mom.
5,Lifestyle Storage Chest,I love the durability of the product. I also have the lifestyle kitchen so they look great together in my daughter's room. It looks decorative but serves the purpose.
4,Excellent In Small Doses,"At 18 songs, it is about as many of Peter Noon's bubblegum songs I can stomach and still call myself a fan of Herman's Hermits. The CD is a decent collection of the origional hits -- hence the title. This is important, being the first two H.H. CDs I bought contained remakes of the songs. While I can't honestly say that I like to spend an entire 50 minutes listening to the album it tastes great when taken in small doses of a song or two."
5,Blue Ox Rocks !,"This tow bar is VERY easy to use....hook up to my Jeep Grand Cherokee takes only a couple of minutes, no tools needed."
3,"Comprehensive, but biased","Ms. Armstrong fails to fully disguise her pro-muslim bias in this history of Jerusalem. While it is true that atrocities were committed by all parties (Jews, Christians, Muslims and others) at different times during Jerusalem's long history, she focuses primarily on those inflicted upon the Muslims, ignoring the fact that the Christian crusades occured after more than 300 hundred years of Muslim invasions upon Christian, Jewish and pagan lands, often brutally, and with disastrous consequences.The ""claim to Jerusalem"", while a very touchy subject and one fraught with the landmines of what constitutes a claim, is presented with her usual bias towards Muslims, largely ignoring the very clear historical fact that it was the Jewish temples upon which all others were later built.Very readable and complete, worth adding to your library if you can take it for what it's worth and balance the information with other sources."
3,Just started taking supplement. Not sure of results yet.,I have just started taking this supplement. The Taste is kind of strong but I have no problem with it. I take it twice a day and hope it will help with my allergies.
5,CALPHALON are the best!,Bought this set a little over 6 months ago. I've never had any problems. I love all Calphalon products as they deliver what is promissed on the box.Recommend! I just ordered another one from AMAZON. Hope it's the same quality!
2,Inconsistent (to put it mildly),"We all know that the Melvins are a frustrating band putting out brilliance and cack with unpredictable regularity and this collection of mid-90's singles is definately in the latter category. With tracks of noise, live improvisation, ladies screaming (really!!!) and remixed (ie. messed with) old songs it's again down to the covers to save the day with strong versions of Germs, Flipper and Wayne Kramer tracks as well as a very odd choice of an early ZZ-TOP song. Generally though this is one to go with Honky as for Melvins obsesives only."
2,Not worth it,"It's OK, but only for the hard-core fan. Others will grow to hate the Melvins, as this CD is mostly comprised of experiments and outtakes. But there are some cool songs."
3,"some good songs, a lot of junk","I picked this up cheap years ago. I'm glad I own it based on some of the prices people are selling used copies for. Maybe I'll sell mine.Many Melvins fans think everything they do is amazing. I am not one of them. I think they have made some great records and some pretty bad ones. This is more bad than good in my opinion. The best songs are covers (Germs, MC5, Flipper, ZZ Top). The worst songs are a waste of time and kind of insulting that they would charge money for it.Melvins fanatics will be upset for that last sentence, but that's the way of the world! Check out Mighty High...In Drug City. You'll probably hate it!"
2,Not so great collection,"I just found this collection too safe. It did'nt go far enough to illustrate the Bakersfield sound in general. The examples seem either too bland or you have heard that song too many times as an example. This collection needed better more passionate scholarship. It didn't make a very good case for what is unique about the ""Bakersfield"" sound!"
5,He WAS a Superstar!,"As much a heart throb this man was....he could be VERY funny too!I especially love the soup scene!I read that it was during the filming of this movie he learned that Rambova was leaving him (going on a ""Marital Vacation"") and his ulcer started to really give him trouble. Yet, none of this shows in this wonderful movie.Also, what wonderful chemistry he had with Vilma Banky....easy to see why she was chosen to play Yasmin in ""Son of the Sheik""."
5,This movie was my first introduction to R Valentino...I now understand what all the fuss was about!,"This man was truly an AMAZING, CHARISMATIC, HANDSOME actor. He did not even need to speak. I really enjoyed this movie. I never knew anything about him except that he died young and his death caused chaos among his female fans and some even committed suicide. I now can understand them. I will be checking out his other films too."
5,Another classic film worth to have,"Lovely film, romantic and funny.Valentino deserves be calledan idol and great actor."
2,Disappointed with Synergy Release,"The Synergy release is made from a decent but worn 16mm copy. The music is not extremely poorly chosen in all cases, but is terribly inappropriate in the scene where Doubrovski Sr. dies. An entire sequence is completely missing where Valentino massages the neck of the female lead. The Alpha version is actually a better transfer (which is saying a lot). Go with the Killiam collection version. In the absence of a DVD release of the Image Videodisc version from the early 90s with the Carl Davis score, it's probably the best out there."
4,"good product, poor service!","Very happy with the product, very unhappy with the company. Despite paying a lot of money for shipping was left with an 11.90 bill for customs before i could receive the parcel. Emailed the company and did receive a prompt reply offering a credit note to use for other orders. When i rejected this offer and requested a refund no reply was received. I would not use this company again!!"
2,Too difficult,"If you're getting this for a kid that's never taken dance before, don't bother. The pace at which the child instructing the video goes, is impossible for an average kid to follow, in my opinion. It made my 10 year old daughter feel inadequate and like there was something wrong with her that she couldn't keep up. Hell, I couldn't even keep up."
5,great,My 6yr old loves this video. It is simple enough for her to follow along yet difficult enough to keep her interested.
4,"cute, difficult","cute moves and instruction, but it goes very very quickly and may be difficult for a child who is too young (mine is 5) or who has not taken any sort of classes before"
4,Great workout but not for kids that are out of shape,"Its a great workout but it's a little intense for an overweight child just starting out. And if your child is younger u might have to watch the DVD and teach him/her the moves 1st, as it goes thru them pretty quickly."
2,"Bad Choreography, Rythmless, Stiff Movement","If you have a child that can't dance at all, this may be helpful. The choreography is slow and choppy, with some songs the kid's movements seemed to lag the song, and the kids seemed stiff. I got the feeling these kids could really dance, but were being restricted to what was rehearsed."
4,Still sounds great,"This legendary album was a right of passage for any rock fan raised in Michigan in the 70's and 80's. This remastered version (Remastered yet again...Keep them cash registers ringin' Bob) is an upgrade over the poorly remastered version released in 1999. Just one complaint...Why take the concert announcers proclamation of ""Get High And Have A Good Time"" that ended the original recording, off this edition? Would that really offend people in 2011?"
4,Bob Segar - Live Bullet,"A timeless arena rock live album . Bob Segar at his best rocking Detroit in the 1970's. The hits of that time are all here-Turn the Page, Katmandu, Ramblin Gamblin Man, Travlin Man, etc. The Bruce Springsteen of the Midwest is the best way to describe Segar's songwriting style. Bob pays homage to Chuck Berry with great rock n Roll riffs throughout and the rocking version of ""Let it Rock"". Bo Diddley gets equal treatment in Bob's cover of the song ""Bo Diddley"" that goes into Who do you Love. Great album everyone should own."
3,A great album but a terrible remastering,"This is a 5-star album with a 1-star remastering, so I split the difference with 3 stars. Stick with the older CD version that is still available. I have no idea what happened on this remaster, but everything sounds much more distorted than on the LP or the original CD issue. Sure, Live Bullet is never going to be an audiophile album, but this Seger classic deserves much better treatment than this.Fortunately, the Night Moves reissue released at the same time does not share these problems, and is a bit of a sonic improvement over the original CD."
5,A must have for any Seger fan,"If you are a Bob Seger fan, then you must own this album. It is probably one of the greatest live albums ever recorded. Many say he and the band sound better live than on any studio recording. Great cd, great songs, its hard to beat."
1,Seger fanatics only,This record isnt too great in my opinion. I like bob Seger but after getting this album delivered I realize I didn't like him enough to listen to the whole vinyl.
1,Find an old copy somewhere else,"This is a 5+ star album with -5 star remastering, so when I split the difference, it's one star from me. I dropped a few tracks on Audacity and there is no dynamic range. It's all hyper compressed and clipped into a sonic brick. It is another casualty of the ""Loudness wars.""[...]Just look at this for example:[...]Why would anyone want to replace their old version with this new, ultra distorted junk. Some remasters are fighting back. Paul McCartney's new remasters are lovely.This version encoded as a 'lossless' digital file would probably sound worse than a 128k mp3 of the original cd release.I know my Seger. I drank beers with Seger at the Red Carpet Lounge when he met Alto Reed when Alto Reed was with Ormandy and Teegarden & Van Winkle were the MC's. Seger cared back then, now he must be too busy, or on vacation. He doesn't seem to care about his legacy as much as his fans do. We deserve way better than this."
5,got to love bob seger,Love the cds I bought nothing can beat him or the price at amazon.The cds was great the music is great.
5,One of the best live albums ever made - EVER,"If you can't appreciate live Bob Seger, we'll just assume you don't really love good live rock 'n roll. In concert, the man knows how to rock the house like few others. ""Nutbush City Limits"", ""Let It Rock"", ""Ramblin Gamblin Man"", ""Get Out of Denver"", ""Turn The Page"" and ""Katmandu"" ... what a performer, unbelievable cd. Always gets me going and tunes I never get tired of. Long live Bob!"
5,Great CD,"This is the first concert I ever saw. Bob Seger was the opening band for Blue Oyster Cult. The music is great. This is one of the best live albums I've heard. The music is crisp. ""Get out of Denver"" really makes you tap your feet. Great CD"
5,"""The Best""","This rates in the top 5 of all live rock recordings (Frampton Comes Alive, Elton John, Here & There etc.) The music is heartfelt, you can relate to most every song personally. The sound quality is surprisingly good for 1976. This is the beginning for Bob Seger into the mainstream and a live recording just four short years later with no duplications attests to that.A footnote to Editorial Reviewer, You're fired. Bruce Springsteen is not from Detroit!"
5,Rockin' Blues at a Rockin' Concert,"Start to finish... Blues Rock!A concert that ROCKS the house... sit back, grab a drink, and crank the volume. The pure energy of this album makes it hard to press stop. A fantasticly involved audience that the band feeds off the whole show long. The essence of Seger is purer in this album than in any other he's released. Whether you're a long time fan or just adding to your collection, you won't regret throwning this CD in anytime you're looking to have a good time. Blues jams w/ tributes to Van Morrison, Bo Diddley, and Chuck Berry round out this full bodied rock show that puts the city of Detroit in an uproar. I only knew some of his later hits before this, and it's converted me to a full-fledged fan. Buy it... play it... and enjoy the aftermath."
4,Great to hear again..,"I had this on LP and CD years ago. lost ove time,Great to have it back in the collection Re-master sounds good."
3,"Good cookware, needs a little tlc","My husband I received this cookware as a wedding gift in 2004 and used it for years with no problems. But after about 5 years of steady and proper use they started to go south quickly. Even with hand washing and proper care the teflon started coming off. The bottoms of the pans are discolored (now whitish grey). I know they are probably still under the Calphalon warranty, but I will be replacing them with the stainless primarily because of the health issues surrounding non-stick, but also because I want to upgrade my set a bit. With hand washing they occasionally retain the smells of the food that was last in the pan, particularly tomato based items such as tomato sauces. It was a pricey set and I expected it to last longer than it did, but it was good while it lasted."
3,Ok.,This story was ok but I have listened to better romance stories and the characters the guy named Nevada and the lady named Cherish Blassingame are ok. It was ok to listen to once but it's not an audio cassette recording I would listen to again and so it wasn't a keeper.
2,"Cute, politically correct daycare production.","Kids MIGHT like it - this ' yet another ' visit to the underpriveleged (??) circles so overused today.Cute, but no cigar ! Boring & simply another production filled with misleading presences of mysticisms, ' ain't they wonderful ' clouds of immaturity aimed at some sort of imagined mistakes etc. ' the white man ' made ( isn't everything the white man's fault? ) against these creatures of God who supposedly had lead a wonderful 'Valhalla'-esque existence on the earth until the ugly old white man arrived .........Nah - way too shallow, way too typically-ga-ga idealistic. My kids aregrown now ... but if they were still kids, I would not provide this sort of overly romantic sugarbowl type of viewing for them.Again, I say "" cute, but no cigar ! ""."
2,"great, if you want to see a bad film","unintentionally hilariously funny at times, this sequel to Tanya Roberts' INNER SANCTUM has little to reccomend it; except for the fact that it is so bad. The cover of the box may decieve those who wish to see a steamy sex film, because all such scenes are confined to the first half hour. The remaining time is filled with cliches and ridiculously fake or stupid horror scenes. Although the film will make you laugh, it leaves you feeling like you wasted your time. The writer ought to be given a pat on the back, and then be shot."
5,Best for a single volume?,"I've never run into a better 1-volume collection of American Poetry than the Oxford, but I prefer the 4-volume Library of America series beginning with 0940450607. You just get so much more, including large selections from Whitman, Dickenson, etc. I have both, but you can decide between the two based on how much you want to spend, shelf-space, level of interest, etc."
4,all the rage,I really like these glasses. They fit my face very well and stay snug with the hook straps at freeway speeds. It would be nice if they did darken a bit more but that's not a complaint. They keep the particles out of my eyes where other similar glasses have not. They will fog up a bit on cool or humid mornings when I stop at stop signs n semifores on my way into work on my motorcycle.
2,dissapointed,"most of these sellers save you a few dollars vs retail but if you have a problem good luck, im not sure about this one ,the last one wanted 15% TO return,these folks ain,t bricks and mortor."
5,one of the best,"i dont know what trichard was up about, but this is one of my favorite albums, right along with too rye aye, don't stand me down, and let's make this precious. i found a dexy cd by chance and bought it for come on eileen, and thats where it started. to me, there is no other music. this is what life is about. the only other stuff that comes anywhere close might be paul simon or colin hayes. i hope that the dexy fan base stays small so we can hold onto the last good thing in the world without the population polluting it."
2,"I thought that this would be ""Geno""","I am somewhat confused. I thought that this would have all the tracks that were on the Geno LP but, alas... no.Only 4 tracks from ""Geno"" made it on to this CD:1) Geno2) There, There My Dear3) Keep It4) I'm Just LookingThe other tracks on this album are taken from other sources. Now, please do not get me wrong... I really like anything by Dexy's Midnight Runners; it just cheeses me off that I have to end up purchasing 3 more CDs just to get the original track listing from the ""Geno"" LP. Also, ""The Horse"" (from ""Geno"") is not available anywhere on CD!... thank you."
5,Great book,"Want to get up and running with Eclipse? This is your book. Informal style, packed with information. Recommended."
2,Chapters reference obsolete tools,"Time has started to diminish the value of this book. Chapters 6, 7, and 8 deal with building GUIs using the V4ALL Eclipse plugin, which is now classified as Obsolete. Also with Eclipse 3.3 now available (the book focuses on Eclipse 3.0), a new edition of the book is definitely needed."
3,a dissapointment,"first of all the book i got (yes i checked the isbn)was only 317 pages and was not subtitled,""A Java Developer's Guide"" but instead ""Programming Java Applications"".There was less than 20 pages coverage of 3.0. very lightwieght.I wouldn't say this was a book for programmers, but the equivalent of a user's manual for eclipse(eclipse made EZ, or eclipse for VB programmers).The first two chapters(60 pages) is just telling you what the menu items do. Almost all the material in this book was covered in the Manning Eclipse in Action book. The exception being this book had 3 chapters(60 pages on gui and swt), and a chapter on struts. I only kept the book for that stuff.I get the impression this is just a knock-off that book so that O'Reilly gets some of the beginner market...Probably not worth your time if you have used eclipse for more than 10 days..."
3,Ok book,I agree with most of the other reviews the book is a little disjointed but it does a better job of explaining Eclipse than the confusing on-line documentation. However I was a very disappointed that it did not cover any of the CDT (the C/C++ development tool) which in my opinion is just as important as the JDT (Java development tool) I switched to eclipse in order to have a common cross platform editor for Linux/Windows/OSX and I also wanted that for cross language development but the CDT was never touched upon.. grumble grumble...
4,"Eclipse, by Steve Holzner",I found this book very helpful in navigating through Eclipse. Be sure to check which version of Eclipse you have; there are differences that can lead to confusion for first time users.
2,"Great start, bad finish","If only this book had stayed on course. Chapters one through three are a great introduction to installing Eclipse and using it to work with Java applications. It then takes a turn away from Eclipse by covering CVS in chapter four, and then continues into a basic Java development book in all of the chapters that follow. If I wanted a book on how to develop Struts I would buy Programming Jakarta Struts. I don't need chapter ten to give me a cursory glimpse into Struts programming. Only the first hundred pages are really about Eclipse. Which is a shame because there is so much to say about the Eclipse platform. I can't recommend this book."
3,Eclipse,"I bought this book and have been making my way through it to teach myself about Eclipse. I did fine for the first five chapters, but after that the trail grows cold because the book is based on Eclipse prior to the 3.0 and later releases. I began having lots of problems because the instructions and screen shots no longer came close to matching what is actually in Eclipse 3.0. So I gave up after chapter five."
1,Not what the title implies.,"The book is a large overview of web development. The amount of XSLT 2.0 information is trivial, unworthy of being on the title."
2,big hopes big dissapointment,"Well, I was hoping this cd would be good but it sucks. Big disapointment"
2,So - So,"The practice tests are nothing like the real tests. That is the main problem. The informational sections were well done. A lot more information is presented than other MSAT books. There is much more detail than other books. But the practice tests make me wonder what they were thinking. For example, almost all the questions in the science section are part of a passage that relates to the questions. Most of the Literature questions are the same way."
1,Poor Preparation,"I WOULD NOT suggest this book to MAST takers. I found it very poorly put together I then wen online an found another book packed full of relevant information which WAS useful. The math section in this book is very poor, harldy any information. Keep in mind with the MSAT - it is generally centered around your state's 6-8th grade curriculum, dont purchase this!"
2,Emblematic of modern education's shortcomings,"On page 340, they tell us about ""theory"": They tell us what it applies to; what it attempts to explain; what happens when it is tested and established; and what is its purpose. Nowhere do they tell us what a ""theory"" IS. Worse, even this ""talk around the subject"" approach is fuzzy. We are told that theory ""applies to a BROAD range of phenomena and is applied to a SMALL aspect of nature"" (my caps). In the process of describing theory, they diverge into the requirements for a hypothesis to be considered scientific. However, they don't define hypothesis either. Perhaps they define it elsewhere (I doubt it), but the reader has no way of determining this, because there is no index. The rest of the book's sections are similarly vaguely written. Like so much of education today, this book seems unable to directly define and elucidate the subjects; it only ""covers"" them."
3,Stop Singing Along,"I've had this album for a number of years and thought I would let Tom's style age on me for a while. There are so many great songs here, but only one that I went back to over and over, Heidi's Song. The reason is that he is humming along in the background of most of others. Some say these are ""signature"" vocals. I call them annoying. George Benson's does this occasionally, and while they are more prominent and part of the song, often taking a solo lead, it is equally as bothersome. I find that these melody line scats distract from Tom's obvious composing talents and playing on the Steinway. I like his piano only CD and will get it soon. I suppose it's just me, considering the quantity of music he has put out, yet I wish I could enjoy more of it."
5,Great new author on the horizon!,"A friend of mine told me to buy this book - what a welcome surprise! I'm not usually a fan of romances - too predictable, not much more going on than boy meets and wants girl, etc. But this book had a story that was fun and twisty and made you root for the characters!I look forward to reading more from this author - she's great!"
4,a trip through heaven,"A friend gave me this book. I had no idea what it was about. It's the story of Adam walking through Eden, reinventing and questioning sections of the bible. I admit I'm ignorant to some of what was being discussed, and who some of the people were, but it was fascinating. The language is poetic, the settings are vivid, and Adam and his little dog are more dimensional characters than in most books I've read. I can see this being a very controversial book in time, especially among people who read religious and spiritual stories. Although i should point out its not preachy in any way, is more satirical, and in fact is a moving story I could see made into a movie. I read Pastore's bio and apprently he is a leading expert on classic literature...and it shows. This is classically written."
2,Mixed feelings,"I've been looking for this in CD for YEARS! When I found it I had to order! The thing is it doesn't sound as good as it did on the albulm. There a shallow, tinny sound to it as if it's lacking bass or something. I've only played it a few times and I'm not as excited with the quality. Is it a download?JG"
5,My dog loves them!,Since she's a treat-oriented dog it's nice to find a healthy product that's also (apparently) delicious!
3,OK,"To be honest I must say i was a bit disappointed - the morillo remix is in my opinion not quite up to the standards that he has set in the past. None of the remixes sound too close to the original - each sounds very different, so for those who are used to borland's guitar riff will find that the central sound no longer revolves around that. I would say that my favorite one would be the EK spider or NuBreed mix. It's only a few bucks, so i think it's worth it for the fans. Those who aren't should stick to the legion of boom album itself - born too slow, wide open, and the highlight, weapons of mass destruction, are definitely more satisfying."
2,Stale,"Well, ever since their first album The Crystal Method has sold records on pure hype.I saw them twice on tour, and both shows were almost the same performance with MINOR tweaks...It goes to show every album has a niche or one cool sound that is promenant throughout the album... It's too little too late. The album reminds me of the old booty bass discs that people used to blast to show off the stereo's bass in their cars.The cd is a bore after one listen through....notice the low price you can buy it for and where you can find it in bargain bins."
1,Otto of the Silver Hand without illustrations!,"Otto of the Silver Hand, by Howard Pyle has appeared in many editions, with illustrations by the author The illustrations are more than half the value of the book; the book IS the text WITH the illustrations. I have given away dozens of copies of it to children and adults. I selected this one from Amazon because it is being newly published, never conceiving that it wouldn't include the illustrations; I can't believe that a publisher can be so terribly insensitive as to produce this book. I am returning it."
2,"Well, it's got beautiful artwork...","...but the story is boring. The best part about the book is the title. There are some good adventure bits, but Otto himself gets to do nothing but sit around and suffer, which is a shame since he has the coolest name. And then there are the tedious descriptions, which maybe seemed interesting to past generations who didn't know any better. I'm probably being too hard on Pyle, because I know he can do better than this. But in any event, trust me: you can safely skip this book."
5,Beautifully written.,"This was a wonderful little book, beautifully written, and a wonderful redemptive story. I am only surprised that this is not commonly cited as a children's classic. Although it should be a fulfilling book with substance for children, as with all good children's books, this is a great book for adults as well. Makes me want to read more by Howard Pyle."
1,Heed the Title,"I made the mistake of reading this aloud to my children based on the first 13 comments.I don't know what is so appealing to the reviewers who believe young children should be exposed to visions of a boy taken prisoner and having his hands chopped off. Yowza. Do you not realize the horrific violent messages this sends to young children?Honor and chivalry? Where? Was Otto's father honorable when he yanked his weak naive child from the monastery only to place him in danger because he had to ""make a man out of him.""The story itself is whiny, boring, and sends no messages at all about chivalry or honor.If you're looking for immersion into the Middle Ages, this book isn't what your child needs."
4,Bayberry candle for Christmas,"The candles were quite nice, and fulfilled the need for a bayberry candle to burn as a Christmas Eve tradition. I only wish the candles came in a box, so the unused candle could be saved for another time without fear of being damaged. But that's a minor issue that does not take away from our satisfaction with the product."
5,Orwell' 1984,This was a tremendous help to my grandson for his English class. He is a senior in high school. Bravo!
1,read the book,"I decided to read the cliffnotes instead of rereading the book before I had a test on it. It was awful, the cliffnotes completely fail to really illustrate the ideas George Orwell was trying to convey. 1984 is an excellent book and well worth the time to read it."
3,asking for more,"i used to listen to dawood alkuwaity from a long time. any way i was pleasesd to have this rare edition in kuwait. only i would like that it was just in one cd not two, just like what eminem did in relapse. and also the music is mixed in maybe two of the songs (i mean that i could hear a far song for another song). any way the product itself is valuable, only we are seeking the best"
5,GREAT GRIDDLE,I BOUGHT THIS JUST TO COOK PANCAKES AND EGGS ON THE STOVETOP. IT'S REMAINED NICE AND FLAT BUT I'VE BEEN CAREFUL NOT TO HEAT IT TOO MUCH TOO SOON(BECAUSE I READ THE OTHER REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING). I FIND TO COOK THE PANCAKES YOU HAVE TO TURN UP THE TEMPERATURE TO 8 ON MY SMOOTH COOKTOP. I LOVE THE PAN AND THE CLEANUP IS EASY.
5,GREAT wedding present - perfect pancakes everytime,"My wife and I received this as a wedding present and have loved it. There is just a bit of a rim, so it is easy to avoid spills and very easy to flip pancakes. I can make 4 at a time on this thing.The non-stick surface works really well, and cleanup is almost unnecessary - a quick rinse pretty much takes care of it.We recently upgraded our oven to a glass top so the griddle makes total contact with the heat surface, but it seemed to heat evenly on our old half broken 70's stove as well.We haven't had it long enough to really tell how long lasting the non-stick surface will be - generally I think you can count on a few good years with proper care - but I hope this lasts a very long time."
5,used every day for a year... outstanding,"Perfectly flat and terrific griddle after over a year of near daily use. The handle stays cool and the surface cooks almost perfectly evenly. I have followed the use and care instructions exactly and have had no problems whatsoever. I season it before every use with a little olive oil and that seems to have kept the non-stick surface in good shape. I have also been careful to never heat it too much. Overall I highly recommend.Update: 2 years+, still going strong. I continue to season it with a little oil almost every time I use it and I try to never overheat it.Update: I think I'm around 3 or 4 years now and it's starting to show its age. The non-stick is less effective (not surprising after several years of nearly daily use), but still I've seen almost no warping. I'll buy another one to replace it, as well as look into other Calphalon products for my kitchen."
5,love the griddle,"The handle is easy to hold and doesn't get too hot, heats up evenly and quickly and cleans very easily. great with blintzes, crepes, and pancakes."
5,Love it!,We use this griddle all the time and it is great! I love the small lip on the edges that keeps things from spilling out. The nonstick works great.It does not get scratched up if you use the right tools on it.
5,Best fry pan yet,"I purchased this to replace my Scanpan Classic Ceramic Titanium square pan. This pan is a fraction of the cost, it's a bit larger, it looks better, and out-performs Scanpan hands-down. The Scanpan failed in just over a year - it suddenly lost it's non-stick finish despite gentle cleaning and care. The problem Scanpan is a thick round metal plate which is supposed to provide more even heating. In practice, it over-heats and burns the corners.This fry pan is better designed. It heats up quickly and the non-stick surface is really amazing. It looks great on the stove-top and it has lots of available cooking surface - something I've enjoyed with square pans. How many slices of bacon can you cook on a round pan? One - right down the middle. With the exception of pancakes, all my food is square.My advice is to let the pan cool down before washing it else it can warp, from experience."
4,Another Calphalon Griddle,"We have been using Calphalon griddles for many years and like them. They heat up quickly, hold the temperature, and clean up easily. These griddles are well worth the money."
5,great griddle,"This is great for bacon or making grilled cheese sandwichs, does pancakes quick also. Does not stick and fits the burner perfectley."
5,nice and easy to clean,This product is great if you like easy clean up. I bought this to replace my Cuisinart Griddler. The Calphalon pan is better non-stick-wise and clean up is a breeze! It gets really hot! the first time I made pancakes I burned the butter while greasing the pan. Just a notch before Medium heat is perfect.
4,Good Replacement/Great price,"I finally ruined my Calphalon griddle from my wedding 8 years ago. I decided to replace it with another Calphalon given how well it stood up over the years. So far, so good. Seems to heat evenly without the sticking...I couldn't ignore the price, I think my original was twice as much."
3,Keep Out of dishwasher!!!,"I spent several hundred dollars purchasing this and the similar cookware set from Caphalon. Performance is great, however, the black finish on outside of the pots turn gray to white after washing them in dishwasher. I have only had this set for 6 months. I cannot believe that in todays busy day and age, that a cookware company would charge so much for cookware then insist it is ""handwash only"". Ridiculous!!! They still work fine but have faded to an ugly light gray. Pretty sad for an expensive set of cookware that I'd thought would last for decades."
2,It Blisters,"Was looking for a griddle that would last and do the job,well this one worked great for about a week then I noticed that the pan had bubbles and blisters on the surface and that it was like paint was being rubbed of the edges.Stay away from this product.The pan never had more than a medium flame as I used it mostly to cook bacon,eggs,and grilled sandwiches.I,m going to cast iron."
2,Warped Griddle,"I purchased this griddle In August of 2006 and use it every Sunday. There is alot i like about the pan, but one huge problem is it warped. I know you are not suppose to put a hot pan in cool water because that will cause this to happen, but I did not do that. I have a smooth glass top surface to my stove so a warped pan is not good. I do have to say the heat still conducts though the pan to give me even cooking thoughout."
3,"Like another reviewer here, mine warped","I love the pan, and used it a lot. Great for eggs, sandwiches, etc. Like another reviewer here, I have a glass-topped, electric range. The pan warped significantly- it will no longer lie flat on the range and that makes the heat uneven. After about a year of use, the non-stick finish is wearing off in some spots as well.So, it can be a nice, functional pan, but be sure to use only medium-high heat under it- especially if you have an electric range. And if you want the non-stick to last, you must be very careful in cleaning it. (Keep it away from teenagers!)."
2,surface peeling,I have used this griddle for about a year. The surface is now blistering and peeling. I am going to return it directly to the manufacturer and hope that the new one is better performing.
5,A Likely Childhood,You may find yourself reminiscing about your own childhood as you read this novel. Put your feet up and enjoy!
2,Not as Good as Accidental Tourist,"I read this book after being enchanted by the Accidental Tourist and other of Anne Tyler's books. This book deals with the life of a depressed teenage girl and unless that kind of thing interest you, I would not recommend reading it. On the up side, it's really short so you can get through it rather quickly. I was hoping to read a good book, but only felt worse after finishing this one."
3,First-time Tyler reader...,"My first impression was, ""What a waste of time."" But- I kept thinking about this story, which is a characteristic I value.The characters seemed implausable. Little they did felt real; they were just unbelievable. Evie's behavior is never really explained either; her seeming obsession and devotion to this remote guitarist is rather implied.She has a turning point when he publicly insults her, even though he has allowed plenty of humiliation in the hopes it would help his career. While it seems like it will cause no lasting damage, she eventually makes some changes on her own.It's curious and disturbing. I'd like to say it ends hopeful, but I don't find myself necessarily pleased with Evie. I can see some similarities in Tyler's work from the movie The Accidental Tourist. Don't know if I will read another or not."
3,""" Evie Decker: Fake Teen""","Tyler does not do much research on teen and their life. While reading this novel I wondered if she herself had ever experienced her teenage years. Although Tyler makes her characters very depressing, this depressing feeling makes you think about life. Tyler made some very fullfiling points, but did not express them to her known capabilities."
4,Anne Tyler is always excellent,"Is there a better author alive today? Nope, I still can't think of one. I read this in a single sitting.I gave the lady a short review last week, and I'm going to do it again now. I started with her first published book and am happily working my way forward through a career that the rest of us can only dream about. Not because of any financial rewards, but just because she knows she gave us this, an amazing body of literature that will always be there.This book and IF MORNING EVER COMES have a special charm for me because they bring back memories of my own childhood. It's been said she moved her writing out of the South, but I don't think you can take the South out of the writer. I'll find out.I went to used bookstores, but you can probably go to the local library. Do what I'm doing. Get all her books, start with the oldest, work your way to the newest, and just marvel and enjoy."
3,I did not like the ending.,It is a very good story. But the ending was not good. That is just my opinion. It was okay.
2,One of the most depressing books I've ever read,"Usually love Anne Tyler, but I found this book to be depressing, without a shred of redemption or hope. While I respect her gift for dialogue, to me, that was the best part of the book, the story was just a downer."
2,Yeesh.,"Tacky, hyperactive, loudly rock-flavored pop-country, with Restless Heart/Exile-ish group vocals, and a blunted Southern rock edge. It's terrible. A couple of songs are almost, I repeat, almost, good, but really -- this is a terrible album."
5,WOW!,I have the album and have seen them in concert at the Roundup in Tampa and the were GREAT. I thought the album was a great mix of fast and slow. I would recommend this to my freinds if they liked country music or not. My favorite is another nine seconds and all things considered. These guys are great!
2,Indoor use only,"I was disappointed by the quality of this flag. The material is too thin for use outside - wind, sun and weather will wear it out immediately. The Eagle Globe and Anchor application just looks cheap.If you put this up in the BEQ's you will get chewed out."
5,Condensed enough,This book is about 258 pages and has what I was looking for. There are plenty of reaction mechanisms for the molecular reactions taking place and the book is basic enough that I can start here before moving on to more detailed texts.
1,Biochenistry II,"I ordered BioChemistry I and II and Molecular Biology for Dummies.1- Bio I and II the font is too small2- Molecular for Dummies too difficult ie too many things you need to know to understandI am now studying the internet references and learning a lot, can go step by step andright gradient - and have found material that explain things very clearly and answersmy questions. Plus Youtube helps too.-So the 3 books are not being used maybe when I have done my Ba and know more they willbe easier...-I did try to review before and they looked OK, first off you can enlarge the font size ona computer, next you can easily click Wikipedia and dictionaries on line for definitions, but a book with a paper page is kind of a limited thing.-Bente Petersen"
5,Good thing I ordered this,"This book single handedly got me through biochemistry. Great as a study aide, especially if you are having a hard time understanding the concepts. Explains them in a simple, straight-forward way with lots of examples and diagrams."
5,Japanese Canadian World War II,Exccellent story detailing the facts from one who lived through the jingoistic treatment of Canadian-born Japanese during World War II. G
5,The way movie books should be,"I had previously readRound Up the Usual Suspects: The Making of Casablanca : Bogart, Bergman, and World War II, and the quality of that book prompted me to order this one. I was not disappointed. The book was originally written in 1977, which is a good thing as many of the principals were still alive. Their memories are a big part of the story, including all the conflicting memories that add spice. The author has a chapter on each aspect of the movie, including the munchkins with accounts of many of the 100 midgets used in the film. There is plenty of background on the major figures. The whole book is very enjoyable and is highly recommended."
1,Hammock chair,"Have not been able to use, the adjustment straps slip and you cannot sit in the chair. Needs a better design"
1,Poor Workmanship - Unsafe,"I purchased two of these for use in my backyard. The cloth material for the seat was well constructed. The wood and rope portions were very poorly manufactured. The packing material stuck to the polyurethane finish, some portions of the finish had no stain at all. The ropes were hazardous to use. When assembled and hung, the first person to use hit the floor when the permanently attached (factory assembled) rope separated, allowing the person to hit the floor. Rope was uable to be reused. Foot rest ropes were too short for application and could not be used. I returned both and am still waiting for refund for second chair (over four weeks). I would not recommend these, since I was just lucky that no one was injured."
1,Don't waste your money,"Ropes do not lock in place, adjusting is almost impossible. Foot rest rope is too short. Didn't buy the stand in time to be able to return the chair, now I'm stuck with it. Wish I would have spent the extra money and bought the Airchair outback lounger. My friend has that one and will have to see if we can modify the bars/ropes on this one to make it usable/adjustable.Don't waste your money on the Nami Chair!"
1,Zealously Negative Viewpoint,"I was excited to read this book, but was quickly disappointed. I rarely return books, but after reading some of this book I couldn't continue because, try as I might, I couldn't relate to the majority of what I read. The author holds zealously negative views of people, it seems. I am very introspective, feel confident admitting my faults and make a life's work of searching for how to be a better person, including learning of more faults. I was born on the cusp, gemini/cancer, but am gemini. The description of gemini was so off the mark that I read cancer, but was almost as disappointed. As I continued reading specifics for birth year under each sign I gave up. It seems this author confidently sees the world as a place chock full of extremely problemed people with little going for them (or at least all geminis and cancers). Too bad."
4,Personality/possibility blend,"Delighted to read this book, particularly the positive tone Mr. Lutin employs Additionally, my knowledge of charts compares with conclusions the author makes and broadens my thoughts of the individuals."
5,Sunshines:the astrology of being happy,"What a wonderful way to quickly get in touch with the stuff that can keepyou from being happy. If you can lower your defenses for a moment or two, you can begin to feel what Michael Lutin says is not only useful and true, but that his advice is positive and motivating. He has a wonderful sense of humor that helps take the edge off any painful self realizations. He gets to the heart of what's keeping you from feeling your absolute best. I've learned a lot so far from the book. It's a keeper."
5,I am buying this for everyone on my holiday list!,"A happy looking cover masks this amazingly insightful staple to any Astro-enthusiast. I originally borrowed this from the library. After two renewals, decided to buy it because it will be one to come back to on a regular basis. I have studied astrology informally for nearly five years & have yet to find a more accurate depiction of specific strength/weeknesses, attributed to more than you coul ever wish for in any horoscope. -Moving, yet playful. If you only ever buy a single astrology book in your lifetime, this really should be it. It's easy to understand; no 'mumbo jumbo' and yet helpful in understanding yourself & others' motivations."
3,why such a brutal split ???,for me sleeper is a band who belong to history.the beginning of nineties gave us wonderful great pop rock british bands....d'ya know what i mean....of course this is the last album of this band but i think this one deserves your attention and recognition.you will not regret it...i believe this is not a masterpiece but pleased to meet you sounds good ....and in my opinion it's so much better than most of british bands now
4,A very good album,"Contrary to information listed above, Sleeper is indeed together and have not split up. Although there's not a smash like ""Statuesque"" from 'The It Girl' or ""Inbetweener"" from 'Smart', it's still a great album. Standouts include ""Because of You"", ""You Got Me"", and ""Rollercoaster""."
4,Six Way Paragraphs: Middle,"Someone had lightly penciled in answers in the first half of the first portion. It wasn't a big deal to erase them, but I was under the impression I was getting perfect condition."
3,"If you like Provence cooking, this book is for you.","Some really good recipes to expand your mind and palate. There are an abundance of seafood and meat recipes in this book. Also, there is a 3 month menu planner than can help you get some variety in your eating. I would bet there are at least 10 recipes that you will enjoy very much."
2,Disappointing,"I live in Australia and the recipes are not well suited to the Australian way of life, particularly the long summers we have in the sub-tropics. The ingredients are very French and I find I have to do a lot of substitution. While there are colour photographs of some dishes, there are not many, they are of poor quality, and are all in 12 pages of this 260 page book. By current standards of publication for cookbooks, it falls way short."
4,nice choice,i really love this table set.i bought this for my 3 year old ...i dont have to worry if she s running around the table b/c its safe and made of plastic ...its light so easy to move around...easy to claen... reasonable price...i thnk i love it but i just wish that table size wa a little larger
2,Not for 2-3 year olds!,I too have to say that this set is not for young children. I bought it because the price was great and it was made of sturdy plastic. But the chair legs are too long and get more narrow at the bottom. My son was constantly tipping the chair over and hurting himself. It is a very sturdy set but I wanted something he could use now and ended up returning the set.
1,Totally disappointed,"I am completely floored, so to speak, with the chairs that come with this table... and so are my 2 and 5 year olds because they always seem to end up on it! The chairs tip over constantly. They've hurt themselves when it was on the kitchen floor so I moved it to the family room rug and they still fall over. The chairs are light as a feather. I called Step 2 and they sent me 2 new chairs that they said were better designed. Not!!! When I called them back, they said to fill the chairs with sand! In my house? It, unfortunately, is in my basement, awaiting disposal. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, no matter how much it matches your decor."
2,Chairs are too unstable! Unsafe for younger children.,"My 2 year old received this as a gift for her 2nd birthday so she would have a place to have tea parties and do crafts. There has not be one time that she has used it when the chair hasn't fallen over. They are too unstable and fall over way too easily. The solid plastic design is invincible, but it is also so light that they just tip over at the drop of a hat. I wouldn't recommend this table to anyone that is trying to buy a SAFE product for their younger child."
3,Lifestyle Table Table and Chairs Set by Step 2,We bought this set for our daughter to match the kitchen and she really likes it. The biggest concern I have with it is that she has tipped over several times when sitting on the chairs. They are a little top heavy and she tries to sit on them sideways and then they tip over easily. It is a very durable set though.
2,Chairs keep falling over-WATCH OUT!,"The light-weight, hollow plastic construction of the chairs will make your little ones fall over onto the floor every time they try to sit on these chairs. Also, the legs of the chairs are completely vertical (up and down) and do not provide much stability further ensuring that your child will fall over. We have pretty much given up using the chairs altogether and have our toddler sit on a box of baby wipes instead. Even though this table set is cute, BUY SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD."
2,Very Unstable,I bought this table and chair set to match my 2 year old daughter's Kitchen and Toy Box but she can never use it. The chairs are too tall for her to get on by herself and they tip over really easily! Even when her 4 year old cousin came over to play he had a problem getting on the chair! We ended up selling it at a rummage sell. We are buying a Little Tykes now since the chairs look like they won't tip very easily.
2,"Chairs too high, toddler topples off constantly","We bought this around Christmas time for our 18 mo. old. He was too short at the time to climb on and off himself and fell a few times. I figured it would be fine once he was taller, better at climbing....nope! He is over 2years now, 35 in. tall and today tipped over and almost hit his head on the fireplace (my fault it was too close, but still!) These chairs are just not stable. Might be good for a 3 year old?? Otherwise, I just think it is dangerous and if I still had the box, I would also return/exchange it."
2,VERY AGGRAVATING,"I love the fact that Step2 makes a table and chair set, to match the Lifestyles step2 kitchen. I have purchased the kitchen for my 3 year old son's birthday... and his grandparents purchased the table set to match. Unfortunately, the last two years we have purchased items such as these, from Toys R Us, we get them home only to find out that pieces are missing. I really wish they would do a better job of making sure that everything is in the box. It is a major disappointment when you have spent so much money for only half the product."
4,This should solve the problem!!!,"I purchased this table and chairs for my 3 year old twins. Just the other day for some reason one of the chairs were upside down I noticed a little plastic plug that unscrews and comes out. Well, I found out that the chairs can be filled with a little sand so that way they can not tip over anymore. My twins were both falling off the chairs everytime they would go to get on them, but now with the sand holding the chair down they are a little more stable. I hope this helps everyone that has this set. I am pretty happy with this table now!"
4,Awsome Table Set,"We purchased this for my 1 year old and she loves it. We have no problem with the chairs tipping. She actually climbs on them to sit. She loves to open and close the little drawer. I will be buying another set for my sun room, so during the summer she can get lunch out there. I also purchased the kitchen set and matching toy bin both excellent items!!"
3,Not the best choice,"I try to buy the best choice whenever I select a toy. This table is attractive and easy to clean. Unfortunately it turns out I did not make the best choice because it is a bit too tall for it's proportions. My 20 month old wants to color, make play dough, set up tea sets, and sometimes climb on the table. A lower or larger table might be better for these activities. Unfortunately this table is really only good for careful activities or else it may flip over. Also it is too small a surface area for most activities. The chairs are too tall proportionately also, which means they are easy to flip. If I could start over, I would select a low, square, steady table."
2,Chairs,"I really liked the idea of this table set - but when we got it home for my busy 20-month old, he had problems sitting in and keeping the chair upright. Just watching him manuver in the chair concerned me so much I put the chairs back in the box. I plan to take the set back."
3,the sound is great!,"Estas son las mejores cuerdas para guitarra que he comprado, el sonido es genial!Are the best guitar strings I bought, the sound is great!"
3,"Good strings, get weird green stuff on them after a while","These strings sounded great, but after a while some of the coating started wearing off and a weird green substance was on the strings. They still sounded good, but it was weird. They were a little overpriced, though. I'm currently using DR RARE's. Half the price and the sound is better (in my opinion). The DRs also feel alot nicer on the fingers."
4,Great Book,"I loved this book. I've read it several times, given copies away and then bought replacements. It's not particularly well written, nor is it badly written. The story is so-so. The main character is annoying. The few fights in it are under-described or only mentioned in passing. There are so many things NOT to like about this story. Yet somehow it stikes a chord in you as you read it. It triggers some kind of inheriant pride in being human that I just don't understand. It leaves you feeling good about the human race."
4,Entertaining,"A lot of pusillanimous yet funny and hilarious aliens. All the mental pictures I created made me laugh more than once (I do like the Turlog). An expected ending. Some seriousness mixed with a pleasant naveté. In a nutshell, a gratifying and enjoyable read."
3,poorly written military science fiction,"This is the first book in its trilogy, and the best written. However, best is really not that good, compared to works by other authors. Foster takes an interesting idea and tries to write something approximating military science fiction. But if you have read Pournelle, Weber, Stirling or Laumer, then Foster really does a mediocre job.In this book, the narrative is not bad and can capture the reader's interest. But towards the end, we see descriptions of actual battles. These do not match in drama or detail or intensity those you can often see in the other authors' writings.In the 2 subsequent books of this trilogy, we see a scenario of interstellar conflict between many races. But the descriptions of the futuristic weapons and tactics are rudimentary. Granted, Foster concentrates more on the politics. But the grand idea in the first book lacks something in its instantiation."
3,Interesting but I expected little more,"If you love reading about geisha, nature, Japan and relation between man and a woman you can find the book satisfying, enjoyable. I was looking for more dynamism. In certain point I just got bored by the book."
5,Beautifully written & translated,"A beautiful book. Kawabata is a master at depicting loneliness and sadness. You can feelthe whiteness and the cold, cutting against your face and under your feet,and otherwise engulfing you as a whole.Against the freezing quiet background, the passion between the characters stands in stark contrast,while the inevitable outcome blends in perfectly.Seidensticker did an excellent job with thetranslation."
5,Book Order,Great service. Condition of book was stellar and it was delivered in a very timely manner.
3,Lost in translation!,"I read this English translation and the story was hard to follow and boring at times. My wife, who owns the same novel but in a Spanish version translated by César Duran, was delighted with the story. Then she read it in English and told me that while at the most basic level the development of the novel was similar the English version seemed to her lacking poetic flow while the Spanish one was pure beauty.I found this fascinating!To think that a foreign author can be so differently understood by all of us simply because of who translates the work. I wish I understood Japanese."
5,the master,"As a teacher of comparative and literature (with a focus on poetry, but the novel as well), I feel confident in saying that Kawabata is a writer of such brilliant painterly effects (by which I mean I visual and emotional evocations), that I rank him at the very top of twentieth century writers in the world."
2,Very Mediocre Work,"Snow Country is about a man who takes regular trips away from the city & goes to a little town in the ""snow country"" in northern Japan to have sexual affairs with the local geisha. On one of his trips, he sees a young woman & becomes attracted to her. The book has some beautiful imagry that makes me see the sights, hear the sounds & smell the smells of the snow country. But the book just doesn't have the ability to really draw me in to the character's lives. Instead of fascination, I'm only mildly interested. While the sensual imagry is beautiful, it's not masterful, as in a work like People In The Summer Night. I've read another work by this author, Thousand Cranes, and enjoyed it much more. I was really drawn into the world of the characters in that novel, but not here. Overall, I felt that this book, for the author & classic Japanese literature as well, was a letdown."
2,Snow Country,"In spite of all the professional reviews singing the praises of this book I found it difficult to read. The characters are tragic individuals caught up in a state of existance that is pathetic at best. Yasunari Kawabata uses a mirroring technique in the dialogue between the two protagonists that dulled my senses. For example, ""I am going out"". ""You are leaving""? This is often followed by a paradoxical response, ""No, I am staying"". This was most difficult for me to appreciate.Kawabata does a wonderful job describing various nuances of life in the mountains and the life of one Geisha. He makes the scenery tangible and the people visible to the readers eye.I had to make a commitment to the book in order to read it through to completion; and, by the time I was finished, I was depressed."
2,Apathetic,"I didn't really care about the characters nor the love story. The implied passion was just that, more implied than revealed through the actions of the characters. I was excited when I picked this book and disappointed when I finished it because my expectations were high. Maybe too high.Do not read the introduction which spoils the conclusion of the novel. Just a heads up."
1,"Dull, dull, dull......","Ok, being fluent in Japanese and familiar with Japanese culture, I can see how this book (and style of writing) may be considered ""of literary significance"" in Japanese. Rendered in English, it is simply dull. For students of Japanese literature and writing styles, it may be worth ""research"" or ""study"" time, but it is not something the average English reader would pick up for entertainment value. The premise of the book seems to be based on ""painting"" the atomosphere around the characters, in all the drawn-out details. In Japanese, there would probably be a lot more significance in the descriptions and words, simply due to the underlying subleties of the language. However, in English, it's simply boring."
4,Snapshots from the snow country,"There are no revelations, no unwindings, no developments present in this book. Other than the change of season marked by two visits of the male protagonist Shimamura to the snow country, there isn't even a sense of time. Instead offered is a collection of beautiful, serene, _static_ images. Alongside the somewhat monotone dialogues between Shimamura and Komako, images of the Japanese countryside are ""displayed"" rather than ""described.""Characters in this novel are, so to say, lost (the Japanese have a long tradition of writing about lost characters, Murakami Haruki being the one of the latest of such authors). Komako, being a geisha and understanding that Shimamura is already married, cannot do anything. Shimamura, even after realizing he is in love with Komako, doesn't do anything. The beauty of their relationship lies in their inaction, indulgence, and pensiveness. These attributes were frozen into colorful yet subtle moments. I enjoyed such images."
4,"Still Poetic, but Not His Best","This story surrounds an arrogant, idealistic man, Shimamura, who is completely cut off from his true feelings. He uses a young prostitute, 20 year-old Komako, in the snow country of Japan to connect to his rigid ideals of love and beauty. She realizes the reason for his affections but allows herself to fall in love with him anyway. Twisted into this tale is another young girl, Yoko(not a prostitute), who also meets the main character's ideals. Symbolically, Yoko represents Komako's inner self. This is exemplified in Yoko's flaming death at the end of the novel. Yoko is Komako herself, burned and destroyed in the flames of her futile love for Shimamura. The story sounds powerful, and it is, but a great deal is lost in Seidensticker's translation."
2,Snow Country is a disappointing entry from a Nobel Laureate.,"Simply put, Snow Country is an incomplete work which tiptoes around the weakly-told tale of a vacationing husband and his relationship with an atypical geisha."
5,Dramatic yet Realistic....,"If I had to describe this book in two words, I would say it was Dramatic yet Realistic.You,the reader,actually start to feel sorry for this fictional character. Somehow, they slowly grasp a place in your heart, like a real person in that situation would do. Pricilla Cummings reached out to all teens who have ever had a problem with who they are, whay they look like, and made them realize being your self isn't so bad after all. I would recommend this book to all teens (yes, even the guys.) Although A FACE FIRST isn't the longest or most challanging book I've ever read it makes for a great ""quickie."" This book is definately one I could read over, and over."
5,One of the Greatest Books I've read !!! By: Stephanie Perez,"A Face First is about a girl named Kelly. I'ts Earth Day at school.On the way home that evening,Kelly and her mother got in a car crash.Kelly wakes up in a hospital in the burnt unit.Kelly discovers that she got third-degree burns.She goes through a lot of things.Like for example,she had to wear some kind of mask. Kelly doesn't remember anything about the accident.She wanted to know so bad.Her mother got burned too,but not as bad as Kelly got it.Kelly starts to remember but as dreams. She thinks ""Is it a dream,or did this really happen?Can I still go to school? Will her friends still like her? If you read this book,you will discover how much courage it can take to face the truth and go on with your life."
4,A Kid's Review,"A Face First is the book that I read. This book is about a girl named Kelley who gets into a horrible car accident and gets most of her body extremely burned. Now Kelley has to cope with herself while her skin and bones heal that nobody's perfect. I think that this book is a great book because you can learn from Kelley's expierence that no one will ever be perect. If you like books that teach you an important lesson, I would recommend reading A Face First."
3,"Really cute, fun, and educational but...","they get mildew in them because water comes in through the hole in their beak! It's annoying that they have that hole in their beaks because they do not squeak. But now all our ducks look greenish and sickly...some more than others. I have soaked them in bleach and that wasn't wholly effective on removing the mildew. I'm not sure what the other reviewer meant by covering their mouths with silicone...how does one do that? My 19 mo. old daughter LOVES them and is always counting, ""1, 2, 3...gibberish,"" when she plays with them and she has fun taking a bath with a big duck family. They couldn't be cuter little ducks, but I'm not sure if they're salvagable."
2,watch out they are painted not dyed,all non-yellow parts of the ducks are painted and come off pretty easily. a little moisture and some teeth for a minute can remove paint. this toy is best for those who are past placing toys or anything in their mouth. I still think they are cute and a great idea...just need to be made better/safer.
3,fun ducks,The ducks tilt over on their side in the tub so he couldn't count the dots. I have to hold it for him to count.
3,"Alright,but...","This album is actually pretty good.It's just it didn't include that many hits!Sure,all the songs on here are hits,but it really doesn't do Audio Adrenaline much justice.It barely featured songs from the debut-some kind of zombie period.It should have been 2 disks with debut-underdog on one and Lift-Until my heart caves in on the other.If I had been in charge of the making of this album it would have looked like this.Disk 11 DC-102 My God3 A.K.A public school4 Big house5 We're a band6 Never gonna be as big as Jesus7 I'm not the king8 Walk on water9 Free ride10 Chevette11 Some kind of zombie12 Blitz13 Blaze of glory14 Mighty good leader15 Get down16 Hands and feet17 It's overDisk 21 Beautiful2 Ocean floor3 Glory4 Goodbye5 Dirty6 Go and be7 Pierced8 Leaving 999 Miracle10 Start a fire11 Clap your hands12 Until my heart caves in13 King14 Starting over15 Are you ready for love?16 Light of the sun17 Losing control"
5,"Awesome way to say ""Adios""","For me, I've never been really big on Audio Adrenaline. Most of the songs on their albums have been hit or miss so it was never worth it for me to own an album of theirs. Even their old greatest hits album didn't work for me, but not this one. This one's chunky. It has the best of the best of their songs (minus ""Dirty"" from Worldwide) and what better way can one say ""Goodbye"" while going out in a ""Blaze of Glory""? I reccomend this cd to fans and ""hit or miss"" folk like myself."
2,"A little to ""hard"" for me.","Maybe I'm too old...I lead praise and worship, but I only felt drawn to a couple of the songs."
5,great album,"What can i say its Audio A!!!!!!!!!!!! Great band, great album. I am really going to miss these guys. Thanks for some great music, and some AWESOME live concerts!!!!!!!!"
5,Hollywood Vampires,"Even Kerrang (UK) could not say a word against this album at the time of its release. It brilliantly mixes elements of the two prior releases with a dark vibe to creating what was later known as ""Glam-Goth"". This album sets the band apart from the other signed ""sunset strip"" bands at the time. This and Vicious Circles are probably the best L.A.Guns recordings to date."
3,Not as heavy as their 2 previous albums,"I love LA Gun's debut album and Cocked & Loaded, but when I heard this one it was a disappointment. Cocked & Loaded had a heavy, aggressive, more serious metal-influenced sound. However, on this album it seems that they decided to change directions and go for a lighter, more fun rock n' roll style. Before this album they never had silly song titles like ""My Koo Ka Choo""... gimme a break. The only track on this album that retains their heaviness is the opening track, Over the Edge. The rest of the songs are not dark/heavy enough, and too ""fun"" for my taste.It's a matter of personal preference, but I cannot say that this is their best work. If you want serious LA Guns with a much harder edge, listen to Cocked & Loaded."
2,This was a HUGE disappointment after cocked and loaded..,"They were to eager to hit the big time. This album is terribly inconsistent.. my hookachoo.. or whatever.. please. over the edge was good as was it's over now but I never made it too far past the second side of my tape. ( I still have the 3-d glasses that came with this recording). They should have spent more time in the studio and less time on gimmicks. If you want classic LA guns get cocked and loaded, a much more fun album than this."
3,Bad packaging,I was very happy with the product however the CD arrived in a broken case due to poor packaging for shipment.
2,Only Good Song is Crystal Eyes,With the exception of the ballad Crystal Eyes this CD is not very good. Its strange how the band such a powerful song in Crystal Eyes and followed it up with such garbage. Its almost as if its two different bands playing.
4,"Holy Zion, Batman!","No idea what that even means really - but..I like this disc. I actually think it's more consistent than Cocked and Loaded - with a little beefier production..what it lacks is that one knock out song like Ballad of Jayne.. so many point to Crystal Eyes, but I don't see it, it's not a bad song by any means but is too long and drags..likewise the opening track Over the Edge.. even the big guns like Some Lie 4 Luv and Kiss My Love Goodbye don't quite have that knock out punch, but again are ""good""..just not GREAT. For me this disc begins and ends with It's Over Now and Here it Comes - too bad the music industry left this music in the dust when it was released no matter what we say now.. but do you really want to open with such a draggy number and then juggle It's Over Now to the near end of the disc?Better cover art and more thoughtful song placement could have worked wonders for this LA GUNS effort.."
5,Wow,"Dashboard does it again! The emotionally stirring music of Dashboard Confessional hits home with their new release of Dusk and Summer. Their new electric-style music echoes the sound of their old acoustic magic, while bringing forth a new stirring sound. It's beautiful!"
3,oh chris...,"this is upsetting. cant help referring back to his old music and thinking, what happened? im not sure what hes going for with this but its not what diehard dashboard fans are used too..."
3,It Sucks!..sorry :(,dashboard confessional's sound and beat are okay. They are more like U2 in a way. They have soft melodies . No songs ae really likr a rock song except Slow Decay . I think 30 seconds to mars is a better band if you want something a little more like rock. But i think everyone should check out my chemical romance ! Though dashboard confessional has serious lyrics they seem boring... if u want punk rock get Three days Grace or My Chemical Romance !
1,Worst Dashboard Album,"This is by far the worst Dashboard Confessional album. Gone are the intimacy, emotion, accoustic guitars and amazing vocals that put DC on the map. Now it's electic guitars, stadium rock, bland, radio friendly garbage. A HUGE dissapointment."
4,Great CD for summer.,"Even in the name, Dusk and Summer is a great summer album. Dashboard Confessional is a pretty decent rock band with it's own chord of slight emo, but it's still good for a drive around town with the windows down, just relaxing.The best songs were Don't Wait, Stolen, and Heaven Here, in my opinion, but many of the songs were quite good. Lyrics are nice and figurative, music is pretty chill. Sure, it's not the most musically genius band, but good for relaxing.So, four out of five stars. Good album. Worth buying to add to a collection of rock music."
4,Great emotion,"I like this disc a lot. Never been a fan of Dashboard simply because I didn't know about them. Heard one of the songs from this album on an episode of Scrubs and loved it. Good, soul-stirring stuff. Get a copy if you still can.[...]"
5,Bittersweet,"Like most other DC fans I have been waiting for this CD to come out since I heard about it's being recorded. This CD was semi-disappointing at first however as I got further on in the CD I got to really enjoy it. It takes a close listener to actually enjoy it. Listen to the lyrics and take it in. Track 9, Dusk and Summer actually brought tears to my eyes, maybe it sounds corny bu it was amazing. I would recommend this to just about anyone. My only suggestion to Carraba himself would be to revert back moreso to accoustic rather than electric/band sounding stuff. His old astuff was wonderful bu his new stuff has anew flavor to it which keeps it new and keeps fans from ebcomign bored. I'm in love."
3,Dusk and Summer,"This CD is neither great nor horrible. Some great songs such as Don't Wait, Stolen, Rooftops and Invitations, and So Long, So Long make this CD worth getting because of the expressive vocals. The best song is by far So Long, So Long, which almost makes me cry. Most of the CD is just average songs like Reason to Believe and The Secret's in the Telling. Slow Decay is easily one of the worst songs that Dashboard has ever recorded. To sum it all up, most of the CD is average, there are a few really good songs, and a few horrible ones."
3,its getting better...,"i havent enjoyed anything of chris' since the unplugged he did. i kind of bobbed my head to the singles whenever they came on the radio and i even thought it would be cool to learn how to play ""vindicated"".this cd is much better than ""a mark, a mission, a..."" whatever the hell the title was. i could have cared less when i first heard the whole thing just as much as i could care now... and thats not very much.i got this cd on a whim. eh, its chris; anything he does should at least be listened to once. i agree with the dude making the Stipe comparisons, but i actually really liked it. its been in my player for a while, so that must say something good.okay, chris, you've got my ear. what are you coming at me with next?"
3,"3.5 stars...better than A Mark, A Mission","This new album by Dashboard Confessional shows the group has grown a lot since the beggining. The Album is good but not overpowerfully strong. Carraba's vocals have gotten better and his lyrics are extremely good. Very good use of different instruments and the touch of the piano on ""Currents"" is perfect. The arrangements are very good and the band has progressed more from punk/emo to being more of a sof punk/rock band, which gives it that much more credibility and points.The highlights are the 2 best songs on this album : ""Don't wait"" and ""Currents"", while ""Dusk and Summer"" is very good.Great comeback for those like myself that basically only loved 1 song on the previous album : ""Hands Down"".Good Job DC!"
4,Good - but there is better.,"To borrow from ""People are People"":Synth-pop is Synth-popso why should it be,we all listen to Depeche Modeexclusively?This latest offering from DM is OK, but please do yourself a favor and try something new, like:Iris - ""Wrath""The Dignity of Labour - ""S/T""The Echoing Green - ""Supernova"""
3,"Eh, So-So.","Since I've liked bands Piet Sielk has worked with in the past, I thought I'd give this album a try.It's not bad, but I find it a little too 'speedy' and repetitive. 'When eden burns' is preferable to this album."
1,"Welcome to 1995, Fogware","I had purchased this item for my grandmother, and I'm glad I checked it out before wrapping it up and giving it to her. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. Horrible graphics, unimaginative features, and overall it looks like something written for Windows 95. Their ""high quality images"" are 320-by-240, 256-color bitmap files, their ""movie clips"" are a slide show of pictures, and I can't say enough bad things about it. Had I done my research, I would have realized there is a CD version of this software, which I'm certain is identical to the DVD version other than the ""7 hours of audio book"". Absolute garbage.I don't write a lot of reviews, but I had to do this. I really hope Amazon takes back software, because there is no way I'm keeping this POS dvd."
4,Dream On,"Dreamboat Annie is forty minutes and two seconds long and was released on February 14, 1976. Dreamboat Annie reached #7 on the U.S Billboard 200 Album Chart and went Platinum. This was the debut album by the group Heart. This cassette is more or less soft hard rock; not true hard rock. The only thing I hate about this album is the title song. It is on the album three times. That is a little bit overkill for me. Dreamboat Annie managed to chart three songs. I give Dreamboat Annie by Heart a B+ for reasons stated above; still it is worth owning.Side OneMagic Man#9 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesDreamboat Annie (Fantasy Child)Crazy On You#35 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesSoul of the SeaDreamboat Annie#42 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles#17 U.S. Billboard Easy ListeningSide TwoWhite Lighting & Love(Love Me Like Music) I'll Be Your Song#35 U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock TracksSing ChildHow Deep It GoesDreamboat Annie (Reprise)"
4,Best debut album ever,"Very good album indeed. 'Magic Man' and 'Crazy on You' stand with the best rockers written in the 70s, fast paced and vocals just belted out. 'Dreamboat Annie', while somewhat stretched thin over 3 tracks, is nonetheless an excellent song. 'Soul of the Sea' sounds more prog-rock, a bit like Yes. 'Sing Child Sing' is more funky, and the rest of the tracks have more understated arrangements. Throughout the album, consistently excellent musicianship and playing."
5,Heart- Dreamboat Annie,"This 180 gram re-release is awesome. The vinyl is very quiet, and the mastering is subperb! This is a must have for all Heart fans!"
5,very good,exciting and eletric album.Ann voice is something wonderfull.the fusion between folk and hard rock is very clear in this album.
4,A must have for any rock fan !,"Excellent first album ! Of course, due to the magical hit single ""Crazy On You"" ! If you should buy only one album from Heart, choose this one."
2,Not a great film,"It could be erotic at times, but for my understanding it was not a great film, Its pointless, so if You want to see just rent it, I got mislead with other reviewers about the film"
2,Not good but portraits the japanese culture quite well,I have seen this movie two years ago. I still have quite vivid movies about it.... Now I have been in Japan for a year and can better relate to the culture as an average american could. So if you don't know Japan don't see it. If you do if might be worth while.
2,"Good seller, Bad shirt","This seller is a good one, but this shirt quality is terrible.I have only had mine since january, worn in it about 5 times, washed it 5 times, and the back shirt is infested with long tear's and holes.I kept this shirt in best condition and as stated above, only worn about 5 times, and it still puzzels me how their are so many holes.It seems as if every time it goes in the washing machine, more and more holes and tears appear.Maybe i just got a defected shirt (if their is such thing as a defected shirt)"
2,What I have learned from Patrick Glenn,"From the passage about his temptation with Basil, I found Patrick Glenn to be a fornicator and a liar. I had to examine the impetus behind this book from the escapades he describes and found that the hypocrisy is so stark, that is dominates and casts a gloomy shadow in his real life. I found this memoir the saga of a serial killer, ""a womanizer"", who abuses women through their integral vulnerabilities, the sex and their baby.One Sunday afternoon when I was three months pregnant with my first child, Patrick Glenn told me ""I will never leave you."" I am 25 years old and Patrick exploited me, leaving me without any support by the time we were 5 months into our pregnancy. If you read this autobiographical piece, you must evaluate the author's character.I can't imagine how many tears and how brutal his relationship with his first wife's was, and this is what he did to me."
3,Good score,"There are better editions, but these are the most affordable. The print is rather small, but worth the small investment!"
3,"More Rubbermaid colors, please!","I got this because I can't stand blah white plastic in my kitchen. I have an old blue dishpan that looks horrid from years of use, but I can't stand to replace it because the only new color I can find is WHITE. This particular product was too small for us--I should have returned it right away because I never used it. But I kept it out of desperation for some $@!*%&!!! COLOR in my kitchen, thinking who knows, I might use it later someday... Found a couple of other color dish drainers, etc, but still would like a dishpan that is red or blue or yellow or..."
3,Must have publication,If readers need some basic information on horses. This is a great publication and contains some great photographics.
3,"Wonderful inexpensive watch, but spend extra for a better crystal","I have to commend Skagen for making inexpensive watches that are truly beautiful and elegant. I love the appearance of it and find it to be very comfortable. As a plus, I never have to take it off when I go through airport metal detectors when using the leather band.My only complaint is that they crystal seems to scratch very easily. I wish that Skagen would use a sapphire or mineral crystal like many other manufacturers. This issue aside, it really is a great watch."
5,BAND ON THE RUN - A REVIEW,"Back in the dim and distant past, i bought this album, which subsequently got stolen after a party.I recently re-bought the CD and it transported me back to shirt collars you could hanglide in and when the wind blew your flares would wrap around your knees!This album was easily Wings greatest album containing such wonderful tracks as Band on the Run, Helen Wheels, Jet & Bluebird.Simply brilliant.The production is superb and there are extra bonus tracks on the CD.A great CD for anyones collection.Please enjoy."
5,This Is McCartney at his peak...Best Solo Album,"This is McCartney at his best. The songs are all great, his voice is at its absolute peak and the production is crystal clear. Not only does Paul play great bass guitar on this album, he is excellent on the drums, which few people realize he played on quite a few Beatle tracks in the 1960's. Mamunia is a beautiful song, crafted around one of his trademark acoustic guitar licks. No Words For My Love could have been a Beatles song,complete with an eerie feeling that John Lennon is singing it with Paul. The track 1985 uses the same long ending gimmick at the end that made Hey Jude famous."
5,Great music!,"This is some of Paul's best music since the Beatles. 1985 brings a ""Day in the Life"" closing to this already great album."
4,ok,"this was one of macartneys best after the ""break-up""...i like it but it aint no ""walrus"" for sure...let me roll it was my favorite track...i'd buy the cd just for nostalgia purposes."
1,"Where's ""Helen Wheels"", Paul?","So, I bought the one disc version and looked at the tracks and thought only 9? Bought it anyway, but still had a nagging feeling something was off... and then when I got to ""No Words"" and then ""Picasso's Last Words"" came up next it hit me... NO ""Helen Wheels""! I have to buy the 2 or 3 disc version to get that on one of the extra discs. It's on my old vinyl version. wtf? Thanks for nothing, Paul, thanks a lot...OK, and for those getting on my case about not reading the listing online: I saw it in a store (remember those?), grabbed it, bought it, played it, not even thinking the record company had screwed around with it. Lesson learned: caveat emptor.And give us Yanks the US version, Paul! A 10 song album is now 9 songs? Come on, son..."
2,one third of it is good,"Packaging is nice but I can't get away from the fact that I still only like probably three songs on this album. In hindsight I would not purchase this if given the chance again. If you like Wings a lot then by all means, make the purchase. Not for the casual fan."
5,"Yo, Kevin A. from New York... Get a clue! Paul Rules!","I just want Kevin A. From New York to know that this CD is too a 5 star recording, and that Paul McCartney is a hell of a lot better than he says! To anyone else who reads this: Don't even bother reading the review of Kevin A. from new york. It's just a bunch of mindless shight."
3,Curious...,I'm curious what the size is for the first two discs. It seems that the entire album and the entire second CD of Bonus Cuts could fit on one disc making for a more compact package and lot less landfill.(The Musical Content of this Album is Top Notch and should get a 5 Star Rating for Music... I rated this Medium because McCartney seems very Ecologically-Minded and yet his latest projects create a lot of refuse... sorta like buying a Big Mac in Two Wrappers in a Box in a Bag...)
2,ruined by problem with packaging,"The rear card is glued to the back cloth cover with that dreadful rubbery goop they use to stick CDs on magazines. It is all but impossible to get off without ruining both the card and back cover. And it is necessary will to take it off because it's flimsily secured only in the centre and flaps around and gets caught in everything. My card tore, and the back cover cloth is all stretched from trying to remove the glue, most of which stubbornly remains on there and looks terrible.Collectors beware!As for the audio content, there are no unreleased tracks, aside from the One Hand Clapping material. And the recycling of the fairly pointless 'documentary CD' from the 25th Anniversary release is an insult to McCartney fans.Granted, the remastering, book itself, and polaroid 'outtakes' are great, but let's hope we get something more interesting in the way of unreleased and exclusive material when it comes to reissuing the rest of the catalogue."
4,A good buy !,"If you are a Paul McCartney fan, this is a great buy. The 2-CD + 1 DVD set is pretty good collection of this era in his career, and the DVD has some especially good coverage of Linda while she was recording and appearing with the band."
4,A Beatles album,"This album would have been right up there with the best Beatles albums (Abbey Road, White Album, Help, Revolver) if Lennon and Harrison had sung harmony on the title track, Helen Wheels and Jet, if Lennon had sung Mamunia and/or Nineteen hundred and eighty five and if Harrisson had added some subtle guitar licks to either Jet or No words.The Paul Mc Cartney album to own if you like the Beatles but not his best."
3,Sounds fantastic but I feel a little cheated,This cd sounds incredible except for one thing. The first 2 seconds of the first track (Band On The Run) are cut. The track starts off very awkwardly. The rest of the CD is intact. The missing 2 seconds must be due to the large data size of the DTS encoding. Looks like we will never see DTS versions of longer playing CD's. This would include just about everything from Pink Floyd :( It's a pity because I think Dark Side Of The Moon and The Wall would sound wonderful in DTS
3,GREAT ALBUM ON VINYL BUT WHERE IS THE DOWNLOAD,"I purchased this product so that I could enjoy a TERRIFIC ALBUM on vinyl and digitally. The statement on the review stated ""**VINYL EDITION: The original remastered album and bonus audio content issued in a 2 disc 180gm audiophile LP that comes with an MP3 download of all 18 tracks.**Where is the MP3 download??? I did not see anything in the packaging suggesting an MP3 download was included in with the vinyl. If someone out there can clue me in, I would appreciate it."
5,"Great Price,Great CD !","I own,two of this CD.1st,25th anniversary.I'd get this one for $15.00 Nice Booklet for Sure, 2 CD's + DVD. Buy It ! R.M."
4,One of their best!!!!,"I realy like this album because I like all the tracks!I still like ""Wings Over America"" better."
3,No compelling reason to buy this version of the disc,"The album itself, a five-star effort, still sounds great. But the second CD of commentary and snippets of unreleased song versions is something you'll listen to once and then probably never again. If you already own a standard copy of _Band on the Run_, skip this edition."
5,Fantastic,"This is a great double-disc; the first is one of the best, most consistent solo albums by any of the Beatles, and the second has some rare tracks while also telling the story of how it was made through people like Dustin Hoffman and the former band members. As for the music; 'Helen Wheels' is a good rock tune that was a top-ten hit, the title track and 'Jet' are just great songs period, and McCartney continues to push himself artistically with the cubist-styled 'Picasso's Last Words'. Paul even plays most of the instruments on here, including drums. All in all, a wonderful double-disc of great music(it was Rolling Stone's album of the year in '74), and great stories."
4,Band on the Run Take IV,"Although released in several formats throughout the years, this one is obviously the best yet. Bonus material is good. DVD includes a great deal of film I haven't seen. Worth the effort."
2,"Band On The Run - DTS Sucks, Music Cut Off","Beware: the intro to ""Band on the Run"" is missing several seconds! How could this happen? No doubt that this was noticed during the processing of these discs, but QC allowed it by any way. Rip off. Take it from me, it happens with ANY player you care to use.Do not buy this crappy DTS disc. Shame on Paul for his failure to oversee this mix and reject it. I hope he was much more involved in the Archive Series."
3,Could have waited,"Mac's Band on the Run is one of the finest he ever did with Wings, and just listening to the snippets of tunes, I can hear some differences:the bass is more pronounced, and the drumming is sharper. You can hear the lyrics more clearly and working with who he had, you almost wish for the fullness that the old mix or the vinyl version had. Maybe it does in other sections. Compare this with the $5 version from Amazon. I have not heard the whole thing, so I'm somewhat biased. But after buying the 'ultimate' 25th anniversay addition, which I enjoy very much.....why? I have not heard the second disc and what they may have done to it, but it would have been nice if Macca would have remixed Wingspan. I've already gotten the catalog with the bonus tracks, and I'm not willing to shell out more $ for remastered sound. Go ahead and remaster the entire catalog, but then release a single or double disc with the best of the remastered tracks."
1,Not another reissue.,"Great album and I am not giving this a low rating based on the music of this classic (and truly great) album but.......I bought ""Band on the Run"" when it first came out on vinyl,I bought it later when it was released on a vinyl picture disc, I bought it on an ""Original Master"" 1/2 speed vinyl pressing, I bought it again on CD when first released in digital form and just last year I bought a ""Re-mastered"" edition CD. That's five times I have bought this music. Now this.Which one should I buy now the $18.00 version, the four disc $28.00 version or the $80.00 Deluxe Edition. Why not all of them !!! Come on!! The only reason for someone like me who has multiple copies already is to get the new DVD. Why not just put out the DVD and stop milking the fans. McCartney is not the only one guilty of this but I wish it would stop (though I'm sure it won't). To all artists out there, please stop ripping off the fans who have supported you for so long."
4,LIKE A LOT.,IT's funny I love this cd but I think wings had better lps than this one. Put it still is great.
3,Falls a bit short,"Okay look, I'm a huge fan and that said, I was a bit disappointed in this single disk. Why? Well, the pictures are nice, it's also nice to have the lyrics and it does sound marginally better - more present and warmer, but really, how the heck do you leave off Helen Wheels? I listened to my original cd and this mix one after the other in my car - loudly. You know what? They're both pretty good and I don't know why I shelled out the money to have one less song. I don't really care about the two disk set blah blah. I would just like the album I remember and love. If Macca treats Ram like this I may not buy that one at all."
1,DVD-Audio a rip-off,"The first few seconds of ""Band on the Run"" are missing from the DVD-Audio DTS Surround Sound -- thus ruining the entire album. How on earth can a record company responsibly distribute a product that omits the opening to one of the most astonishing songs in Macca's career? It's as if the opening seconds of ""Brown Sugar"" were omitted from ""Sticky Fingers"" or a pause randomly inserted in the guitar solo of ""Stairway to Heaven."" What a rip-off. Stick with a regular CD and enjoy the entire masterpiece for a lot less money."
4,Approaching Abbey Road!,"Mccartney ups the ante big time with this album, which won a well deserved grammy for Best Engineering. ""Band on the Run"" features the wonderful title track, kind of a saga within a song. The supersonic ""Jet"" takes off as one of Mccartney's most excting efforts. The album does lag abit with ""Bluebird"" (which is no ""Blackbird"") but ""Let Me Roll It"" is powerful and the album's closer ""Nine-Hundred and Eight Five"" kicks pretty well. Mccartney would never again approach the slick production and songwriting of this album, a fine example of 70's pop. If your'e a Beatles fan, get this!"
3,i also miss Helen Wheels,"i'm American, but even so Helen Wheels was a great addition to the album. after all these years why would i want the UK version with one less song? so for me, the definitive version will still be the 1999 25th anniversary version. it sounds just as good to my ears & has the bonus disc of outtakes."
1,Great album! Not improved sound. Double dip!,"No doubt a great album. But I do not hear any difference from last remaster. Also, Helen Wheels belongs on disc one. I cannot understand Paul's thinking here."
1,as bad as pop gets,"""'Band on the Run' SHOULD [my emphasis] have been a disaster""? It WAS and remains a disaster."
1,wings,I never received the item even though it showed available. I don't think that should be able to list items they don't really have available.
2,Has Not Aged Well!,"Both Lennon & McCartney have put out a string of poor albums with a few good tunes and awhole lot of filler...only George Harrison's solo work truly holds up in this regard...Band On The Run sounds dated...""Let Me Roll It"" is the only half decent song on it! And if this is the album by which all Mccartney's solo work is measured, then paul needs to go into something else...like painting...oops, he already has, and that does'nt seem to work well either....hmmmmm"
2,The King Of Vapid!,"`Band On the Run' may be the best single that Wings ever produced, it is everything that Wings was, radio friendly, poppy and meaningless. I'll admit that I liked Wings when I was twelve. At twelve, the bizarre stream of consciousness lyrics of a song like `Jet' seemed to imply poetic depth, of course a year later I realized that it was just doggerel. That is what McCartney offers to the world, vapid pleasant sounding emptiness, junk food for the ear. For all the meaning of lyrics, he might as well scat."
4,Where`s Helen Wheels?,"I would have given this 5 stars and not 4 if Helen Wheels was on it. It`s one of the best songs from the album, so why did they not include it here?"
5,Band on the Run (Archive Collection),"Brilliantly packaged and first class, the order arrived ahead of schedule and also an email saying the other part of my order would be shipped seperatley but without an additional shipping cost. Keep up the great service.Aussie Ray"
4,Blissful biscuit recipes!,The biscuit recipes are varied and well explained with few out of the way ingredients to locate. Trying the recipes is very enjoyable. The only improvement to the book would be more pictures.
5,Great addition to the cooking library,"The hints and recipes within this book are outstanding, simple recipes with well written directions makes for a easy read. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone looking to start out making biscuits and those pros also."
4,Biscuits Are An Art Form,"I found this to be a very informative cookbook all about biscuits. I had no idea that the type of fat and even the variety of flour can greatly affect the texture/taste of biscuits. He recommends soft wheat flour from the south. Namely Martha White or White Lily flour. Or King Arthur brand soft wheat pastry flour.The author has recipes for basic biscuits as well as fancier biscuits and even scones. He includes basic, savory and sweet biscuits. He also has a chapter with recipes for using biscuits.The recipes are easy to follow and the ingredients are simple.Chapters:Introduction: The Romance of BiscuitsBiscuit BasicsPain Raised BiscuitsDrop BiscuitsCocktail and Tea BiscuitsSconesCooking with BiscuitsHe also includes mail order sources for soft wheat flour, which I've found can be ordered online."
3,"Great music, terrible sound quality","First off, the sound quality. Almost everything Lehua Records has released on CD has sounded terrible. They recently reissued the group's first five albums on CD, and I'm not sure if it's because the masters don't exist, but I'd rather listen to the vinyl, which is superior sounding.Because of this fact, I have to take away three stars. But as far as the group, the vocals, and their music, it deserves a five. Their style of Hawaiian music was from the Big Island, and the two brothers (Ledward and Nedward Ka'apana) and their cousin (Dennis Pavao) had a style that was all their own. It was also a style that would be imitated countless times through their existence in the 70's. This CD has a number of their great songs, including ""Sweet Lei Mokihana"", ""Pua Lililehua"", and the tearjerker ""God Bless My Daddy/Mom""."
4,A Love Like Ours,"This is actually a great album! Her voice is at its best and the music is beautiful. This is a must for all Barbra fans and music lovers. Her cover of ""Isn't It a Pity?"" is the best I've ever heard. Also features a wonderful reading of the country tune, ""We Must Be Loving Right"""
5,HEAVENLY DIVINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This album is SUPERB!!! Each song from ""I've Dreamed Of You"", through the sweet duet with the amazing Vince Gill, to ""The Music That Makes Me Dance"" is a piece in this beautiful mosaic of Barbra's love. Her voice sounds better than ever! What I love about Barbra in this album is the way she transfers from high notes to low notes and from low notes back to high notes. She takes my breath away everytime I listen to her sing.You may love her,you may hate her but when it comes to singing Barbra Streisand is the best. Barbra is the best female singer of the 20th century and this album is the ultimate proof for that."
3,Barbra....why can't you really share some great sounds?,"I am such a huge fan, but again disappointed. Yes, Barbra's voice has never been better...but an entire album with nothing upbeat whatsoever leaves me so discouraged. How about the idea of transitions from some wonderful ballads to a bit of jazz, pop?? Barbra's best works, as far as I have ever been concerned, were when she took some chances. Not on this cd. Ballad after ballad, though beautifully sung, becoming repetitive. Don't let that crazy Celine upstage you Barbra: you have THE voice, but get off of the on-ramp and get in the main lanes and sing to us and make us tap our toes again!!"
4,Truly a magical & romantic listening experience,To say this is her greatest is a bit far fetched but I'm a fan enough to savor the sounds whenever she opens her mouth to emit tone. She is the definition of talent and voice. Perhaps each selection wouldn't be anyone's all time favorite but her inflection and sensitivity to the quality of what she sings makes my heart and ears tingle. Another gift of sound to cherish with all her others. I defy any critic to slam her incredible voice no matter what she sings!
5,absolutely wonderful,"i'm enjoying this album so much, its hard to pick a favorite. as someone else stated you can really hear the passion in Barbra's singing. what a beautiful way to end the century with this album"
4,Celebrate Love!,"To really appreciate this, it helps to have known a love that makes you want to sing. Ms. Streisand has taken her experience and shared it with us. From the outstanding ""I've Dreamed of You"" to the very end she sings what those of us who have truly found their soulmates have felt. ""The Island"" is sensuous, and ""If I Never Met You"" and ""It Must Be You"" are songs that touched my heart. All the songs celebrate love and we should thank Ms. Streisand for sharing these beautiful songs and lyrics with us. I have to agree that Higher Ground is a slightly better album, but this is well done and is already one of my favorites. If you are cynical about love, then don't listen--you won't understand!"
1,This is music?,"If you think this is music then you need to check yourself directly into the smackdown hotel.Sappy love songs... how original.She sounds like every other worn out singer who couldn't come up with anything new to say. What is she 80? At least.This album could have been put together in days easy.Yet this woman has popularity through out the decades.How? Why? when this century is over people will talk about the greats... Nirvana,Black Sabbath,The Beatles,Aerosmith,N.W.A.,Weird Al Yankovich not this fossil."
1,The Single Star,"This is the very prototype of the CD that the 1 star rating was made for. Streisand fans like to tar and feather anyone who does not worship the ground that she walks on. However, I think that the woman herself has done more than enough ground worshipping for all of us."
1,SEEK THERAPY ELSEWHERE; JUST SING,"Once, a good number of years ago, Barbra could bring to a song emotion without making it melodramatic or phony. I regret that I have lived to see her become such a bad parody of herself. My fear is that she is more ""dramatic"" and ""emotive"" to mask the simple fact that her once superlative gift has faded after a forty year career. She needs to stop recording and explore other avenues of expression. I, for one, will not continue to purchase her CDs only to be once again sadly disappointed. Since this material and her interpretation of it is not what it once was, I will remain content listening to the classic Barbra: ""The Way We Were"" and the other late 60s and early 70s albums, when her gift was truly amazing. This new CD is an embarrassment."
1,The Most Obnoxious Diva Of All.,"A sad release here. Miss Streisand keeps putting her life on display for us. I, for one, could not care less about what she thinks, what she does, and who she does it with. I realize there are thousands of people who hang on every word and action of this woman and are happy to spend lots of money on her. Not me!"
2,She's ok but she's no Celine,"I like the song with Celine the best. Celine really pulled it off. Babs is getting golder and it shows it her voice. Celine has surpassed Bab's vocal short-comings, but Babs hums real nice."
2,"Glad she's in love, but weak songs make for a boring outing.","Other than ""Just One Lifetime,"" ""The Music That Makes Me Dance"" and ""Isn't It a Pity,"" the songs are sub-par and boring. Barbra's voice is still the 8th Wonder of the world, but this is an album she should have just given to her hubby and close friends or family members."
1,"bland, boring,barbra! what happened higher ground was great!","babs whats up with all the great song writers and arrangers,why do you continue to sing songs that sound like they are from bad love movies written by some that should have retired<TheBergmans>. the lack of sales should give you a hint. the worst part is that we may have a live version of this from the new years eve concert.i hope you find some new music before them,and please leave james at home!"
2,"Too much ""voice"", not enough background music!","Her voice is in-your-face and all you can hear, no soothing background music. The volume also fluctuates too much. Although I have been a fan for several years, this is a big disappointment and I turned it off after a few of the songs (that all sounded alike)."
1,A major gag-a-thon,This has to be one of the most gag inducing albums I think I have ever heard - certainly in recent memory. Why Babs seems to think the rest of the world cares about her and James Brolin being in love (although it is clear this two deserve each other) is merely proof as to how out of touch she is from reality. Does anyone else remember that horrid duet she sang with Don Johnson? Please. No more.
1,Dissapointment,"She's put out some good ones; this isn't one of em. That's just my humble opinion, but there just isn't anything new and at times the music seems so trite one would think it's Brittney Spears, not a talented artist like Ms. Streisand."
2,Boring,"I am not in any way trying to down Babs but you gotta like the slow, standard type of music in order to enjoy this and being a young person, this kinda slow music does not mix well with me. THe songs are nice love song but for people who appreciate older and/or standard type songs. THere are some nice vocals throughout though which shows that she still got it."
3,Barbara,"Great CD Barbra, let see you do a duet with the one and only Vikki Carr! Even the name of your first albums were similar, Vikki's was ""Color Her Great"" and yours was ""Color Her Barbra"" Hope somebody with authority will read this and act on it. I hear Vikki may do a duet with C. Dion, maybe Barbra needs to get in here too!"
1,worst album ever.,"Barbara streisand should be arrested for the injustices she continues to do to eardrums worldwide. Never will the pain be erased that this recording caused me. If only she stopped while she was ahead, i.e. before she ever started singing"
1,"Lazy, lazy, self-indulgent, ""aren't I special"" sap and tar.","When Barbra started doing films or attempting happy patter on her albums, I often found myself saying ""just shut up and sing"". After listening to this CD, I find myself saying, ""just shut up and go away"". At least until you stop hiding behind film-score arrangements and lazy self-indulgent self-glorifying Hallmark cards you call music."
1,"A lazy, nasal, self-indulgent album of dull songs.","After her last album, the beautiful 'Higher Ground', I was looking forward to Miss Streisand's new album. What a disappointment. We all know she's in love and happy, and that seems to be the whole self-indulgent point of this record. Its 12 songs all sound the same: big orchestra, lyrics about how special/wonderful/precious love is and the dullest, laziest delivery since her 'Till I Loved You' album. She could have knocked this off in her sleep.If you want to hear Babs singing this kind of thing with a bit of feeling do yourself a favour and get hold of 'Love Songs' (released as 'Memory' in the States).Personally I prefer her earlier material where you feel she really cared about what she was doing. To hear her belting out something with emotion and attitude listen to 'J'm appelle Barbra' from the sixties. Now there was a voice."
1,The First Barbra Brolin CD!,Barbra Brolin is no Barbra Streisand. She looks the same on the outside but she sounds a lot more boring.
3,BARBRA LOVES JAMES,"UPDATED REVIEW: 9/10/12A LOVE LIKE OURS is Barbra's celebration of her marriage to James Brolin and obviously a full blown romantic album. All twelve tracks reaffirms her newfound devotion and head over heels feelings for her new husband.Babs' voice embraces each song and on several tracks she's remarkably restrained, evoking an unusual gentleness. Her duet with Vince Gill, IF YOU EVER LEAVE ME and the countrified WE MUST BE LOVING RIGHT are the best tracks on the album. The balance is basically ho-hum songs made meaningful only because of the voice. Lush and romantic, A LOVE LIKE OURS is mainly a Valentine to James and not a true highlight of Streisand's discography."
3,Barbra sings to the heavens and her elation feels real,"It's great that Barbra Streisand finally found love later on in life--and not just in the movies but really & truly found her soulmate. This gushing disc of love songs is orchestrated to the stars and back, with Streisand in full-bodied voice(as always), yet uncharacteristically happy and content. The songs are romantic and gentle, with little complexity. This can be a problem, as the disc has a samey quality that can tire the ear after awhile(and makes repeat listenings redundant). Even those listeners happy and in love like Barbra may long for her to shake things up a bit, as Streisand the Serene on compact disc makes for a sleepy arrangement."
4,A risky effort that realy pays off!,"I think that if this album had been heavily promoted, it would have been a big letdown to the general public.That said, I think this cd is a real gem! For those that are expecting torch songs or showtunes, this is NOT that kind of album.It is a collection of love songs...repeat, LOVE SONGS! It is very simple in its exocution, and is also a much more relaxed Streisand.That is where it stands apart from most other albums.One more thing, I don't think it's fair to expect the ""brilliance"" of ""The Broadway Album"" in every new cd she lets out."
2,Underwhelming songs from an overwhelming talent,"Tracks like ""Isn't it a Pity?"" and ""The Music That Makes Me Dance"" remind listeners that Streisand is among timeless talents such as Garland and Sinatra. Her duet with Vince Gill reminds us that the singer is more than capable of recognizing and aligning herself with talents/voices that stir passion and love from audiences. Why then, is this latest album one of the most disappointing in years? Clearly the voice is at once as radiant, powerful, and affecting as ever. Streisand has always fit more with generations just prior to her own. She began her career when songwriters still knew how to write songs that touched the heart and challenged the imagination. Why not return to those roots as artists like Tony Bennett have done with so much success and acclaim? Nothing would please fans more. On a personal note, may I suggest ""Somewhere Out There"" from ""An American Tail,"" as a duet with Mr. Bennett for the long-rumored Movie Album."
1,"Despite interesting vocal talent, fails in disgrace","I hate having to say this, but Babs, in spite of an interesting voice, didn't catch my attention too much. I had the single ""I Dreamed of You"" before I realized news of the album's release.Mother told me about her singing a duet with Andrea Bocelli, but that's totally fictitious. She hasn't gone with Bocelli (she never will, either). See, it's a strategy that's gone on long enough: whenever new albums by Babs come out, it will seem like a miracle to her entire legion of fans, but not interesting to the likes of me.Bottom line: it's time to surrender once and for all."
1,If there were an option for 0 stars that would be my choice,"This CD is positively disgusting. For starters, the CD booklet is filled with horrificly intimate photos of Barbra and James. The opening track is a failed attempt at a Titanic sounding ballad. Tracks such as ""The Island"" are extremely disturbing. In ""The Island"", Barbra professes her desire to be ""bathed in the waters"" and ""warmed in the moonlight"". This is the kind of music that is played on tacky cruise ships where they serve veal cutlets and red jell-o. If you want a great laugh, buy this album. You will be extremely amused with the corny and nauseating lyrics."
1,Ow Ow Ow. Please stop,"It is painful to even know this album exists.Her voice is a beautiful thing, but since about 1975, La Streisand has lost her sense of taste and proportion. Why do so many divas pick such bad songs, bad arrangements, bad vibes? Why? Why? This album makes Celine Dion seem discriminating."
2,Let's Talk About this album,"Okay, here's my totally grand review. I want to say it's evident everyone is going to compare Celine Dion's and Barbra's voice simply because the two of them sang a song together called 'Tell Him.' And Celine's song appeared on Barbra's album. So it's very relevant to say these things.Celine voice is more high than Barbra's and sweeter, and it's true Celine is 30 years younger than Barbra. That's alot of years difference between them. While Celine may have the more exquisite voice, critics have said about this album that Celine will succeed Barbra as Barbra abdicates the thrown."
2,Our girl,"Went to her latest ""concert"" and let me tell you, save your money. It's not so much a concert as her own little political rally. You get to hear whats left of her voice in between her political diatribe and side show. Mindless socialist drivel. What Babs forgets is that she is the beneficiary of our democratic financial empire. But she defends and comforts the socialist leaders of the world. Funny Girl indeed.Let her go live in Cuba with the Dixie Chicks"
5,keeps getting better with age,"Barbra has done it again! I must say I was apprehensive on a album of ""love songs"". But with the best voice in music she shines on this album. highlites are ""I've dreamed of You"", Isn't it a Pity, the Island, Wait and the final track a throw back to her roots, Music that makes me Dance. Bravo Barbra. You've done a great job!!!!"
2,What a snore...,"Okay, you expect an album that celebrates true love to be emotional and sentimental, but does it have to be so BANAL? Except for ""Isn't it a Pity"" (a standard) and ""The Music That Makes Me Dance"" (a B'way classic) there are NO memorable songs. Streisand is as smooth as ever, but an artist as powerful and discriminating as she should pick better material. From Sondheim to this!"
1,Don't Hit The Add To My Wish List Button!,"For those people who worship Mrs Brolin, it is your perogative to rate this CD 5 stars. To be sure, this is no Broadway Album and even worse than Higher Ground."
1,"Barbra -- Well, you got three cuts right","""Just One Lifetime"" is an incredible vocal performance and an incredible song. ""The Music That Makes Me Dance"" is simply gorgeous. ""Isn't It a Pity"" is great.The rest all miss the mark. And trust me, it's hard for me to say this, as I own every album the woman has produced and nearly all of her obscure 45s.I don't know what the hell went wrong here -- it almost feels like sacrilege to say this -- the whole thing (other thant the previously mentoned three songs) leaves me totally cold.And I see that seems to be a very common reaction.I truly wish I loved ""A Love Like Ours."" As it is, I just kind of, sort of like a triplet of the selections.Maybe she needs some new producer or someone with a better view (and track record) than sycophant Jay Landers. Get a strong exec producer, Babs."
5,Perfect!,"This is great, it makes you want to fall in love over and over again. Barbra's voice is amazing. She sings with so much passion and feeling. Bravo, Barbra."
1,"Oh, man what crud!","This album is probably one of the biggest wastes of money I ever spent! Streisand needs to get some advise on what to record. Her albums were once such a joy. Now, just pure junk!And the photos-- it made me want to puke-- almost more than her dedication of ""Higher Ground"" to Clinton's overbearing mother. Well, what do you expect from a clueless socialist?"
1,"Barbra, do something!","Sorry to add a discordant note but isn't this album just a way to test just how gullible and stupid an audience can be? Not only is this a bad album, for Barbra it's positively shameful. It would be downright immoral for her to terminate her career on this one. Barbra, take some advice: Carole King is still alive, give her a call. For Barbra beginners I suggest the video recording of the 1990 concert in Vegas. There, she proves that she was one of the greatest American singers of the century."
5,Truly outstanding,"Considering that Barbara Streisand recently turned 57 years old, one has to stand in awe of this recording. Her voice is still capable of the emotions evident in her recordings of twenty, thirty years ago. One comes to a Barbara Streisand album expecting the unexpected, and in this case, one is not disappointed. Songs written specifically for her by Melissa Manchester, Alan and Marilyn Bergman, et al. provide a sense of intimacy which is only enhanced by the lush orchestrations.Truly a beautiful collection of songs."
5,Barbra Streisand still has the best singing voice.,"When I listened to Streisand's, ""A Love like Ours"" CD I loved it! This is her greatest CD. I have been her fan since I saw the movie, ""Hellow Dolly"" in the movie theater back in 1968! In the future, I would like her to record 12 songs written and produced by Babyface. This would be very exciting! I also would like her to work with Mariah Carey, Toni Braxton, Seal (Barbra called him ""fabulous"" in a New York Daily News interview), Whitney Houston, and Lisa Stansfield. Barbra needs to work with new and different Songwriters and Record Producers. I hope she works with Barry Gibb again, and she should record another CD similar to her 1974, ""Butterfly"". Barbra Streisand will always be my favorite Female Vocalist, Entertainer and Idol!"
1,She's Found Someone She Loves Almost As Much As Herself!,"An incredible batch of uninspired, lifeless songs. Maybe a lot of you people out there worship her but I cannot and will not."
5,"I'll take an ""overbearing...paean"" like this anytime!","As I listened to that beautiful voice singing with and from her heart, I couldn't help but recall the old Johnny Mathis ballads that inspired generations of young lovers. How refreshing it is to hear Ms. Streisnad bring out those same emotions in ""boomers"" so many years later. To me, there was nothing ""overbearing"" (as found by your reviewer) in her delivery, unless one considers honest emotion and warmth to be overbearing. I rejoiced in hearing a woman in her 50's celebrate in song the love and happiness she feels for her husband. Bravo, I say; dim the lights, uncork the champagne, put some logs in the fireplace, light the fire! Oh, and restart and replay the CD."
2,"Skip This One -- Buy ""EVERGREEN...""","Sappy, over the top, wring that voice into a charicature of itself. Com'on Babs. Isn't this a bit much? For those who love the melody without the melodrama, pick up the brand new ""EVERGREEN: MUSIC FROM THE FILMS OF BARBRA STREISAND"" with its wonderful orchestral performances of her greatest film hits."
2,Sappy all the way,This album was pure sugar. Her worst album in a decade. Mrs. Brolin was cleary drunk on love. Every song in this album was sweet like molasses. What a boring album.
4,Barbra - GREAT AS USUAL!,"I really enjoy her new CD. I think her voice is fabulous, as always. Barbra is truly the greatest singer and performer of all time. I always look forward to her new CD or movie. She is so talented. I do think some of the songs sound alike but I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I have been a fan of Barbra's for many years and will continue to be."
2,Mundane at best.,The cover alone gives away the fact that this belongs in the bargain basement bin of over-hyped infomercial muzak that pretends to be popular.Like her marriage to Dr. Welby's intern this album will not be what Barbara will be remembered for.
3,The first Spur winner of a noted western author.,"This novel won the 1954 Spur Award for best western novel of the year. The story focuses on the eighteen-year-old Dan Nathans who is traveling with his parents and young brother to settle in a region of southeastern Oregon. Dan, who is alienated with his father, goes to work for a local, and powerful, cattleman. He soon finds himself caught in a feud between the cattleman and the settlers. He is also caught between his affections for a young woman, who is believed to be of ill repute, and his own upbringing. The reader sees him mature through the novel."
5,Rebel Dynasty is the BEST,"If you love early Heinlein and you you like your SF mixed with a little real physics you have got to try these books. They are grittier and more true to life than early Heilein and far more violent than anything but Starship Troopers, but the violence moves the plot and is for a reason. These books are for adults (though the sex when there is any is far less detailed than the adverage bodice ripper) due to the graphic nature of the violence and the adult situtation. This is my favorite SF series and my favorite SF character. The author takes Heinlein-like grasp of physics and then places it in a real and gritty setting. The results are a modern classic."
3,read the track list before buying,"Not exactly the best of lime... there's only one lime song on the two cd's. Some good music and the track of ""Babe we're gonna love tonight"" is well worth the cd itself. I think a little infringement on the name of lime makes them ""guilty."""
5,Magic and Mayhem behind the scenes....,"As thrilling as the movies themselves, these accounts of making them add to any hardcore ""Star Wars"" fan's enjoyment. Mishaps, inside jokes, the pressure of deadlines, meticulous attention to detail, the intricate choreography of the space battles and duels, and how those fabulous special effects are done are almost as exciting as the finished product. The demands placed upon the actors, who must ""interact"" convincingly with characters and weaponry that isn't even there (added later by special effects artists and computer animators) is astounding. The reader gains a new appreciation for the genius of George Lucas and crew...as well as a hope that this won't REALLY be the last of this magnificent saga. I also recommend the excellent ""Once Upon a Galaxy"" which is the making of ""The Empire Strikes Back."""
5,Amazing!!,"This book is everything i expected and MUCH MORE!It gives a great insight into the making of Ep. III, and i gotta say i always wondered how everything comes about when making a Star Wars movie: this book details it!!Amazing pictures, great stories and a lot of details into the movie making process.I got this book with The Art of Episode III one, and they complement each other beautifully.This book is a must for any Star Wars fan!!"
5,Wedding Gift Confusion,"I'm assured by my Son and my Daughter-in-law that the Wedding Cake Gift Tower was really beautiful and had lovely contents. I would also like to thank your staff for sorting out a problem I caused at the Palm Springs Hotel, by addressing to Mr&Mrs before their marriage ceremony at the hotel. Which caused confusion to the hotel reception staff,in accepting the gift from the carrier."
4,Great story despite a poor ending,"While this is not my favorite House of Winslow story, it's still a good story overall. Joy and Travis lose their parents and younger sister and are forced to live with their selfish uncle who mistreats them and steals their inheritance. Eventually Travis leaves, and Joy goes looking for him. Along the way a circus performer named Chase saves her from unsavory characters, eventually they return to the circus and Chase trains Joy to work with lions and tigers.My one complaint is that the story cuts off suddenly at the end, leaving the feeling that there should have been more."
5,old fashion fun,I played this game at a friends house and then purchased to give to my family for Christmas. I know it will add to an enjoyable Christmas Day.
4,Great.,Good product and a good price. We use these in zone air filters and it does seem to reduce the particulate matter in the air. I recommend their use. It is a fair deal. I think they were in boxes of three and it beats trying to find them at Lowes or HD.
1,It's not the same,This filter is the same size but seems to be thicker than the original filter. It causes strain on the moter. I can't use them.
3,"filter is good, but system it belongs to can be costly","This filter fits into a small air purifier that only covers about a 10x10 foot rm. It works, but once I run out of these filters I stocked upon, I will lose the purifier itself."
2,Generic,"This filter is not a Hamilton Beach brand, it is a generic filter that is about 1/2"" (inch) smaller in width (at least the one I received) leaving a gap when placing filter in the air purifier. I will need to fill in the gap in order for the filter to remain steady."
2,"Joni, can you hear me?","Joni, how many of these re-hashes will there be? If you are not going to make any new music, then how about publishing some art books featuring your paintings? I am sure you would find a good world-wide market for them. Screw the art galleries, take your work straight to the people! Many of your fans would delight in a different aspect of your phenomenal talent. But this serial recycling of the past must stop! The original albums are all superior to these collections."
2,Released only for profit motives?,"(4 & 1/2 stars for the songs, 1 star for the concept) I can't think of any ARTISTIC reason for the existence of this collection, especially with so many of the songs on Joni's various other previous compilations, including the ""Hits"" and ""Misses"" CDs. Her recently released ""Beginning of Survival"" CD at least had an environmental theme to justify its existence. This new CD has no justification. I really love Ms. Mitchell's music - the Blue and Court & Spark albums are two of my all-time faves - so it's sad for me to see her be a part of a money-grubbing move like this. Joni fans like me will regret buying this disc even more when the inevitable box set comes out in a year or two and has all the same songs AGAIN."
5,If you were wondering.....,"If you were wondering why so many musicians and critics (and fans) think so highly of Joni Mitchell's work, or if you've heard a few songs and would like to hear a broader sampling, Dreamland is the answer. It offers the heyday pop hits (Free Man in Paris, Help Me) some early folky touchstones, (Big Yellow Taxi, Circle Game), a selection from the fantastic jazz-rock masterpiece Hejira (Furry Sings the Blues), a delightful 80s comedy-drama with Billy Idol and Tom Petty in guest roles (Dancin' Clown) and much more, including some late career orchestral reinventions of earlier songs (Amelia, Both Sides Now). Dreamland is a delicious taste of the diverse and delightful Joni Mitchell catalog."
5,very funny movie,"as a danish girl i heard about the movie from my brother who lives in denmark. i ordered it and was hooked.. i just LOVE this movie, its funny and crazy.it has the typical scandinavian humor in it, but i think most people will understand it though.i can only recommend people to buy or rent this movie, its great, refreshing, funny, no, not funny, hysterical!!the only thing i dont like is the translation, i believe that its almost impossible to translate the humor into another language. but this is a problem many movies have, not only this one..."
4,What a great treat in the movie theater.,I caught this film at the Nuart theater a fews years back. What a fun and entertaining film. Very nice to see a good foreign film. Rather than a rehash of boring themes.
2,*** DON'T READ Edmonson's review ***,PLEASE DON'T GIVE AWAY SOME OF THE PLOT THAT COULD RUIN IT FOR ME (the bit about the wife)
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"A friend loaned me this book and I looked at it here and there. I sat down one night to really read more of it, convinced that it would bring me closer to God. This book left me disturbed. Also, I was baffled by Tenney's twisted portrayal of the story of Mary Magdalene encountering the risen Christ. Investigation found me articles outlining the disturbing errors in Tenney's interpretation.Please DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Instead read your Bible (which Tenney, by the way, refers to as ""old love letters"" and the ""old, moldy pages of what God has done""). If you don't believe me, pull out a Bible and compare Tenney's teachings. This book could really confuse and disturb. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
1,Religion must die,"Yet another in addition to the endless line of religion & ""spirituality"" books written by graphomaniac, megalomaniac, scam artists and sociopaths.Why are people so gullible? Why are there billions of people who believe in silly things?There is no god."
5,Gabbard Hits the Mark Again,"Gabbard's Third Edition of Psychodynamic Psychiatry keeps an already classic psychodynamic analysis of the DSM IV up to date with the lastest revisions of the DSM IV. It is what we have come to expect from Gabbard and more. Listening to and hearing our patients remains as necessary now, and even more necessary now, precisely because of the chemical interventions which are now available."
4,A Very Good Movie,"Unlike _Lawrence Of Arabia_, this film delves into the talks after the taking of Damascus and all its frustrations. Excellent acting. A nice companion to _Lawrence_. END"
3,Laurence after Arabia ...,"This was a very intellectual film about what happens to Laurence in later life.It has its moments, and yet there are places where it seems to drag. If you loved the first film, you may find this one quite interesting."
4,How accurate is this movie?,"Spoiler alert.I just finished reading the chapter about the Arab Revolt in the book ""Paris 1919,"" which details the events of the Paris Peace talks after the end of the Great War. There is nothing in that chapter about this letter documenting a British promise of Arab independence, which Lawrence was to have released to the press. Was that true? I would like to know."
2,"Pretty sneaky, sis...","This movie is horrible so wanna know what I did? I made screen-caps of it so I can use the hotty pics of Ralph Fiennes as a slide show as my screen saver and sit at work pretending to be hard at work doing whatever it is I'm supposed to be doing while what I'm really getting up to is watching my number one celebrity crush dressed up like some kind of sheik and then sometimes dressed up like what appears to be a WWI era British soldier of some type.Whatever. It's better then what I had before which was a slide-show of my sister's newest litter of newborn Pug puppies in some sort of backyard pool with a Disney Tinkerbell motif which always seemed to depress me to no end. My god, Pugs are even ugly at birth."
4,Superb viewing,"This is an excellent film which gives the viewer a more intimate view of the enigmatic Lawrence than its predecessor ""Lawrence of Arabia."" The acting and directing are first-class and the rapport between Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes) and Feisal (Siddig El Fadil) is wonderful to watch."
5,MY DOGS LOVE THIS PRODUCT,I love Artemis food too. I know how good it is for my two yorkies.. The quality is far higher than other products.Amazon came through for our dogs and us.
2,You get what you pay for !,"every small amount, must be samples they are selling. will be gone in two to four usage was expecting more ."
2,Bvlgari BLV pour homme,"I ordered 2 of them and then the delivery was delayed. Apparently I was informed that they were out of stock so they only sent me 1 cologne and reimbursed me for the other. Pretty much disappointed by their service not the product, watch out for delays."
2,I Can't See It!,"As far as I can see, this CD is lacking a center of purpose! As a huge fan of the Zombies, this CD has little or no relationship to the simple, yet amazing band from the 60's. Although we expect musicians and their music to evolve, this isn't the evolution I had hoped for. This CD gives off an overproduced impression with some of the songs sounding like out-takes from a Broadway show, while others are reminiscent of forgettable 80's pop. Unfortunately, I expected much more from these two musical icons, but this CD isn't it. Colin Blunstone's voice is still one of the best to ever grace a pop record and Rod Argent's talent requires no explanation, but that isn't enough. Maybe one day they can make a CD that's simple, leave the overbearing strings behind and get back to their brilliant rock roots. Maybe they could just re-record some of their best stuff from the 60's, but if it means they'll sound like this CD, forget it."
3,Colin Blunstone & Rod Argent (Zombies) - 'As Far As I Can See' (Rhino),"Saw the two British Invasion veterans play live a year before this CD was released. To be honest, I wasn't all that impressed with this effort. I mean - it's okay. Sone of the tracks I was good with were ""In My Mind A Miracle"", their closest tune to a Zombies classic ""Time To Move"" and fellow Argent member, the Russ Ballard penned ""I Don't Believe In Miracles"". Pretty much aimed toward the die-hard fans and completists."
3,"A trip in the ""Way Back Machine""...","I have fond memories of owning this on vinyl and wearing them all out.I am only giving this 3 stars b/c while the remasters are good, there are alternate versions of the songs from the original release.Really takes me back to the bicentennial year."
3,Fly Like An Eagle,"The 5.0 Surround Sound remix of ""Fly Like An Eagle"" was excellent; however, the interview and concert was mildly interesting at best."
3,note: no Space Intro on the surround mix,"Fans of the album expecting to hear the groovy 'Space Intro' in surround -- e.g., me-- are in for a disappointment-- it's not there. It was also omitted on the earlier DTS suround disc. To me, this is like omitting 'Speak to Me' from 'Dark Side of the Moon'.Weirdly,one of the documentaries on the DVD *does* start with a bit of the Space Intro-- in surround.The CD remaster has it all of course,but of course that's also been given the 'everything louder than everything else' modern dynamics reduction treatment, common in remasters nowadays, so that you can hear it all in your car or when you're listening via your ipod."
3,Steve Miller - Fly Like An Eagle - DTS 5.1 an Oldie Reborn!,"This is a review of the DTS version. As stated in other DTS 5.1 CD reviews, the older 70's music is taken from the 4 channel era and the vinyl that was released for Quadraphonic CD4, SQ & QS systems. Since these were mixed for 4 speakers and not 6, the center channel is lacking and the subwoofer is weak. The DTS surround is fun, but that too has it's problems... the sound is mixed more to dazzle you with movement than to place the listener in the middle of the band. The overall sound is crisp and the music is still some of the best to come out of the 70's, so if you want a piece of music history in a unique format, grab it, you may find an oldie reborn!"
5,Miller Soars,"Steve Miller's transition from aquarius bluesman to top 40 hitmaker reaches a highpoint.Continuing in the same vein as 1973's THE JOKER;Miller's outstanding fretwork and friendly voice are now joined by hit parade sensibility.Songs like SPACE INTRO/FLY LIKE AN EAGLE,TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN,DANCE DANCE DANCE,ROCK'N'ME,SERENADE,and WILD MOUNTAIN HONEY all have appeared on ""best of"" compilations(and rightfully so).Steve Miller also pays tribute to his roots on fresh sounding covers of YOU SEND ME and MERCURY BLUES.Miller's band follow him confidently through different musical styles:blues,r'n'b,space rock,hillbilly.Although I would not include many of Steve Miller's albums in my collection(THE JOKER,BOOK OF DREAMS,and ABRACADABRA being the others),I always put on FLY LIKE AN EAGLE when I'm feeling down to cheer me up.A perfect slice of mid 70's top forty."
2,Where's Space Intro?,"Has anyone noticed on the DVD-V disc that the complete Space Intro is missing? All we get is a partial (0:27) Space Intro. What was EMI thinking when they did this mixdown. Come on EMI, you need to go back and do another remaster of this album again, this time rembereing to include Space Into. Then give a free exchange to all customers who already bought this horrible excuse of a album. Then at the same time, a recall of all unsold copies MUST be done. This isnt the first time EMI has bungled on a reissue."
3,you don't need the dvd,No doubt this album is great but if you already have it you do not need the dvd. The dvd concert is not what i call a good concert. The vocals are off and the playing by steve is very rusty. Trust me just enjoy the cd.
2,The Tragic Cost of Selling Out,"Once upon a time, Steve Miller was a musical force - though at the time, he got little airplay. From ""Children of the Future"" through ""Number 5"", the Steve Miller Band made great music.The came a troubled period, followed by ""The Joker"". With this album, he set his sights on breaking the Top 40, and while he succeeded, it was hardly admirable work (not an uncommon tale among those who trade respect for profit).""Fly Like An Eagle"" continues that pattern of pandering to the lowest common denominator - a pattern he seems determined to maintain.If you'd like to know what the man is actually capable of, I recommend ""Sailor"", ""Brave New World"", or ""Your Saving Grace"" (sadly, out-of-print)."
1,somebody start a school for these idiot concert producers,"the DVD concert. Horrible! I was very much looking forward to this, but all I can say is the direction here is just horrible. It suffers from the number one mistake most concert DVDs make- the camera never keeps a shot for longer than 5 seconds! I'm not kidding! By the time Fly like an eagle rolled around, I had to turn it off- it was making me dizzy. This totally detracts from a concert feeling.A good example of concert producing and camera work is the Led Zeppelin DVD set released in 03 and pick and Austin City Limits concerts on PBS. why is this so complicated to learn? one would think a monkey could do this right."
3,"DTS version is very good, but with some strange flaws...","We all know that this is a classic album, but how does the 5.1 mix hold up? Well, to start off with, my biggest gripe is that 'Space Intro', the original opening track, is NOT EVEN ON THIS CD! You hear a few seconds of it, then the title track starts. On top of that, the title track is the short version! When I pay ($) for a newly remastered album, I want the orignal album - Is that too much to ask?!?!As far as the mix, the sound quality is very good and the mix is clean and spatious, but the rear channels have an incredible amount of hiss as times, the only time I've ever heard this on a DTS disc.In summary, if you like the album, you'll like this, but let the buyer beware. Recommended with some strong reservations..."
1,Fly Like An Eagle (DTS Surrond Sound),"I should've paid more attention to the other comments concerning the deletion of the song, ""Intro"" before the song Fly Like An Eagle.Do the people who made this DTS Surrond CD fall asleep when the disc was being mastered? To leave out the song ""Intro"" shows they don't care about the product and probably never listened to the complete version which has the song ""Intro.""Anyone who purchased the disc should get their money back or if they ever redo the disc please include ""Intro"" and send us a free copy!"
1,"TRACK 1 ""SPACE INTRO"" MOST OF IT IS MISSING","The album is obvious a classic this review is for the DVD-Audio that sellers are listing item as. I purchased two they were both DTS-CD don't get me wrong it still sounds good but if you want a DVD-Audio disc ask before you purchase.MOST OF TRACK 1 ""SPACE INTRO"" IS LEFT OUT ON THE DTS-CD RELEASE.DID THEY THINK NO ONE WOULD NOTICE?"
4,Versatile,I have this pan and use it every day for a variety of cooking. I bought a new one for my daughter for Christmas and hope she enjoys it as much.
4,excellent large not stick pan,Really have enjoyed cooking with this pan. I hate long handles and this pan is perfect. Made chicken parmesian and the heat conduction on the bottom of the pan was uniform. Excellent for starting a dish and finishing in the oven
2,Junk,"I bought this everyday pan replacing a 20 year original commercial quality pan. I was amazed how much cheaper this pan is. Even though it has the same part number, Calphalon has significantly reduced the thickness of the pan and the handles. This pan is also now also made in China and not the USA (of course). That must explain the name Contemporary, code for off-shored. In my opinion, it is barely suitable for occasional home use and this replacement pan is unlikely to last 20 years like my original. This version is cheaper, but so is the product. You get what you pay for."
2,Far from the original model 1382,"Owned a model 1382 for 10+ years and loved it. Bought this one to replace the original that was wearing out. First thing noticed is that it is shallower then the original. Second thing noticed, is the weight. Original pan was 3 lb 10 oz while this one is only 2 lb 7 oz. Feels very cheap. Have not used it yet, but far from impressed. Trying to decide to return it or keep it."
1,This is the worst pan I have ever used,"This pan is absolutely horrible if you have a glass top stove. If you look at the bottom of it, you can see that the middle it a little bit higher than the rest of it. That means it will SPIN when you have it on the stove. This causes completely uneven cooking, and if you accidentally get water or other liquids on the bottom of the pan, they'll squirt out at you at random times when you're trying to stir. I had always heard Calphalon pans were fantastic, but this one was nothing but a huge disappointment.The handle design is also a big pain, since its impossible to pick up with one hand, but that's just preference. I was looking for a frying pan to use every day and hoped this would work. It doesn't."
1,Poor rating due to receiving damaged/poor quality product,"I ordered this pan on two separate occasions from Amazon. Product was advertised as new. Both were received with clear degeneration/defect in the non-stick coating. I wasn't willing to risk a third attempt. If you're purchasing, I'd recommend another seller than Amazon.I did eventually purchase this pan from Macys, and it's actual performance is outstanding. We truly use it for everything, everyday. It's large enough to sauté a mighty pile of greens while also handling braising duties in fine fashion. Do get the pan, just buyer beware of ordering from here in my experience."
4,THIS IS A GREAT PAN....BUT..,"I have had two of these and they are great. Easy to cook with a clean up is a breeze. This is a great everyday pan, buy one. The one down side is that using it everyday and despite taking care of it, I have sent two of these back to calphalon for warranty replacement."
5,Fantastic,"I am a senior music composition, classical guitar major and this book has perfect music for a college recital. Some pieces are so challenging they may take years to work them up. With extensive notes and no tabs, the music is easy to read and very fun to play. The pictures of the real scores are awe inspiring. Kind of just a gimmick because I wouldn't read them but very cool to look at. I love that the music is mostly contrapuntal because loads of classical guitar music isn't. Not good for sight-reading because the pieces are so hard. A wonderful book complement any guitarists notebook and to add many masterpieces to performances."
1,READ THE REVIEWS - 0 STARS,"It is now too late...I should have read the reviews. But, it is now too late...1. This megaphone is somewhat more expensive than comparable items on the site. BAD2. It is sold through Amazon so you get it quickly. GOOD3. It arrived with scratches on the visible parts of the megaphone. BAD4. It arrived with the packaging INSIDE the box broken showing it is refurbished while advertised as new. VERY BAD5. I am not sure it works yet so that is another potential surprise.This taught me a good lesson and I will avoid this re-seller in the future."
2,Opened & Damaged Product,"Like the previous reviewer, mine arrived with bad packaging, and the original box was already ripped open, without any manual, warranty, etc. There are noticeable scratches on the megaphone. Very disappointed."
1,Terrible - Do not buy,"Coaster Leather Furniture is terrible - very cheap construction!Our Coaster leather couch completely split and continues to crack after only 3 years of gentle use. On the other side of the couch, the seat is compeletely sagging.I tried to get the company to work with me to find a solution but they refused to help me at all. They have shoddy products and they know it. They push it on unsuspecting customers.Terrible - avoid this product.Note that we have a similar couch not exactly the same one"
5,Great! A sure win!,"My girls love to watch this! It plays beautifully, and the kids will sit and watch it! Love that it's on prime!"
5,"I thought ""West"" meant...Pennsylvania","Another classic Real Ghostbusters episode, a riff on the OK Corral legend. The writers played on one of the quintessential American genres, the Western, and it worked to a surprising degree considering it's a 22 minute childrens' cartoon. (""Duey La Mort""? I still have to laugh at that...) ""Aces and Eights...DEAD MAN'S HAND""...I grew up on this stuff, and this episode is another one of my favorites. Wonderful animation...check out the twilight lighting effect during the gunfight! Awesome. ""This is Boothill, Ray..."" A MUST for the RGB fan. As I've said in my other reviews, the tiny collection of episodes available on VHS is all that remains for us to re-experience this great cartoon...RGB FANS: EMAIL CARTOON NETWORK!! BRING RGB BACK!!"
2,Continental Portuguese Deserves Better,"These tapes cost too much for what they deliver. I love the Pimsleur method of teaching and have used their French tapes with much success. However, the speakers on these Portuguese tapes sound bored, the vocabulary is extremely limited, and unfortunately, you are not at all ready to use the language as a traveler when done with these tapes. I would love to see Pimsleur do justice to continental Portuguese."
1,Poor value!,"The Pimsleur method itself is really quite good. I used the comprehensive Italian course and was quite pleased with my results. The problem with the ""compact course"" is that there really isn't enough ""meat"". By the end of this course I was quite comfortable asking "" Do you speak Portuguese?"" ""Would you like something to eat?"" and ""Do you have escudos?"" That, however is about the extent of the vocabulary one will pick up from this course. Really not worth 70 dollars."
2,A Very Limited Language Learning Tool,"I was mostly disappointed with this product. Over the course of 10 1/2-hour lessons on 5 CDs, you are drilled ad nauseam on a very few words and phrases, only a few of which were actually helpful when I traveled to Portugal. Amazingly, you only get to numbers higher than five after something like 6 lessons have gone by. Moreover, the pathetic ""booklet"" that accompanies the CD only offers 10 pages of words that the speaker reads on the CD and you just passively listen. That's it. Except for the plus that the repetition of the words and phrases did provide some benefit in preparing for my trip, there is little else to recommend here. I would suggest that someone wanting to learn basic Portuguese get something more substantial."
4,Good program considering limited availability of European Portuguese programs.,This program is good. There is not a lot of variety in European Portuguese language-learning programs but this is one of the better ones I've tried. Slow pace but it does have enough to variety and helps you to stay focused. Ties new words/sentences into in with what you've already learned. OVERALL: good program for the price.
4,Pimsleurs European Portuguese,"It's difficult to find a European Portuguese program, and this learning method is excellent. And words are pronounced slowly so that they are easier to repeat."
5,Great for Learning,"This is a great starter for learning the language. If you drive 30 minutes to work every day like I do, then this is a great way to make that time useful. My Portuguese in-laws are impressed with how well I picked up on accents and what I've learned so far. Its a shame that these are the only lessons for this language, I would love to learn more of it with this technique."
1,Be Warned!,"IO Gear will NOT stand behind their rebates...be warned! Both my friend and I bought a 320 gig external hard drive and we both were refused the rebate for different reasons. We have the paper work to prove we were eligible and we are working with Better Business Bureau. This hard drive is very large! Twice the size as you can imagine by its pictured ad, another deceiving tactic by IO Gear."
2,Spring is too strong,"This is a nice can opener with a major problem for some people. It has a latch that holds the two handles together. The latch has a very strong spring, which makes it difficult to press. You need to press the latch button to open the handles to place to opener on a can, and then you need to press the button again to remove the opener after the can is opened. If you do not have a problem pressing the latch button, you would find this to be a good can opener. But I couldn't use it and had to send it back. Actually, I can't review the opener because I never actually used it -- just trying to deal with the too-strong spring was too much."
5,The best and most detailed in its field,"This book is a great improvement over the same authors' book "" Digital Signal Processing"". Not only they cover some new material but they greatly clarified presentation of the old. This book goes into pains to explain what's really happening rather than just scattering formulaes. It's a mostly theoretical presentation. It can be complimented by books which cover more of the applications."
3,"Alright, let's say it's okay","The electrical engineering approach to teaching a subject can often be quite rugged in comparison with the other hard sciences. I believe that for many students, an honest and unbiased appreciation of this text takes quite a bit more time than other hard science texts. Treating this book with respect and his or her instructor with reverence, the talented student who dedicates herself or himself to be a disciple of DSP will profit from Discrete-Time Signal Processing."
1,it s not the seceond edition which i was looking for,i was looking for the 2nd edition of the books not the first edition which has o use for me.
3,Ignorance of Elementary Network Theory,"The authors apparently are ignorant of elementary theory of electrical and digital networks. In the 1975 edition, on page 223, and in the 1999 edition, on page 829 - quarter of a century later - they give the formula for the transfer function of a digital network with finitely many components as a rational function of a Jacobian elliptic function of the normalized frequency.The authors - all of them Electrical Engineers - should know that the transfer function of a digital network or an analog network with lumped components is a rational function of the frequency, whereas a Jacobian elliptic function and any function derived from it by rational operations is a transcendental function. No wonder students are frustrated in the classroom."
2,discreet-time signal processing,"A decent book, but the seller sent the international paperback version which came in three volumes and was very low quality binding."
5,The reference for DSP,"This is probably the most complete reference in DSP. It's full of examples covering the whole stuff in DSP. However this is certainly not fur use as an introductory book because the aim is not the explanation of fundamental concepts in DSP (for that go to Lyons ""Understanding Digital Signal Processing""). Maybe it is possible to learn DSP with this book but then as a companion of a good undergrad course, not for self-study.As stated by another reviewer, this book is over-crowded with developments, details and examples that could be overwhelming to the newcomer. This is probably its biggest drawback, in that its completeness hinders on its readability. So be aware that this is not an easy DSP book, it's THE DSP book."
3,Didn't really live up to expectations,"Based largely on the company's videos of squirrels being spun about and flung off bird feeders with this device, I got one to try to discourage our very aggressive squirrels who have destroyed bird feeders, hogged all the birdseed, and generally been big annoyances. This thing did work for some of the squirrels for a while, but apparently our squirrels are smarter than those in the video, since they quickly learned to hang on as the device spun until it stopped, which it always did after a few moments. It senses the squirrel's weight on the feeder to start spinning, but it didn't seem to recognize when the squirrel hadn't been thrown off and stopped spinning. Maybe it only spins for a set time? Whatever, it soon was not a deterrent to our very determined squirrels and they ransacked the bird-feeders at will. Maybe it will work better for others."
4,Inexpensive Backyard Entertainment,"This product appears to keep squirrels off of our feeder. Have had one for multiple years and it finally burned out. This year, it has kept a family of four squirrels busy each morning as they try to defeat it. And watching them ""twirl"" is always fun!"
2,Poorly made,"I have bought 3 or 4 of these because when they work they work well! I think the first one cost around $15 now they're very expensive for what they are, and my last two have only worked for a few weeks!! I need to find out what kind of warranty they have because this newest one, for which I paid $35+, stopped working after two weeks. This is ridiculous."
2,Damn Rodents!,They figured out how to grab onto the feeder & stop it from twirling around. It worked at first but now they know how to do that! Pesky varmits!!!!!!
2,Hyper-sensitive,"While this machine does what it says it does, it is very sensitive. It works with your feeder, and when you hang the feeder from it, turning it on will cause it to go through a calibration cycle to set the hanging weight. Supposedly, it will spin for 15 seconds when the weight goes up by about a pound, assuming there is a squirrel causing the weight increase. Oftentimes it will just spin on its own with nothing to trigger it. After the 15 seconds, it stops, then starts again, and continuing this cycle for no apparent reason. . When that happens, turning it off and back on will re-calibrate it for its current hanging weight, and it will work OK for a while. But before long, off it goes again. Seems to be OK until a squirrel gets on it again, and then the sensitivity makes it go berserk once more. I would NOT recommend this to anyone. I'm trying a Brome 1024 next."
3,Problems with Stop Squirrel Unit,"While this unite does work sometimes, I am finding we have squirrels that manage to by pass the system and get on the feeder. They then continue to reach in the openings and fish out the Sunflower seeds. I am not sure if the culprit is just one squirrel or several."
5,Depressed? Suicidal? Cure all your ills.....BUY THIS BOOK,"This book is quite simply the funniest book ever written.My Father tried to read this book to me, as a bedtime tale when I was 8 years old. He used to get about 2 pages before falling off the end of the bed laughing. This, to an 8 year old was funnier than the book. To those over 8 who have read this book, nothing is funnier, ever.I read it first, when I was 14. I laughed so hard and so loudly that I woke up everyone in the house. To this day,the lines (and I paraphrase here, forgive me) ""Thank god the ground broke my fall."" ""Yes its handy for that."" sends me into spasms of laughter. I dare you to read this book in a public place and not laugh out loud."
5,A Very Talented Writer,"The New Tain... without the bulls, the Hound, Fergus or Meave. However, there is, a wild panther, Roman Centurions, wild bike ridss, a Chinee policeman and the worlds most sophisticated commode. All these threads (and more) are woven together by a master storyteller, hilarity ensues. Hilarity in the truest sense of the word, this is not a book you would read in public as the resulting howls of laughter are sure to draw unwanted attention. I'm new to Spike Milligan, having read only one other book, and I'm glad I discovered him. A truly talented writer who has written a truly memorable work."
5,Today I bought my FOURTH copy,"When I was 14, my friend lent me his stolen copy, and I loved it so much I went back to where he stole it and PAID for it! ( I had morals back then). Over the next 15 years I recommended this hilarious book to many, many friends. I lent my well worn copy over and over, never learning that it may not come back to me, it was always passed on by another new fan of Spike. So today I bought my fourth copy, amazed to find it still in print. My son will pee in his pants as he reads it! BUY THIS BOOK. If you like it, by Spike's ""silly verse for KIDS"" -- that's great too, but I can honestly say I believe this to be the funniest book EVER written."
4,A Really Nicely Done Biography of Helen Keller's Life,"I thought this was a very nicely done biography on Helen Keller. Its intended audience is the young reader but I found it interesting and satisfying as an adult. I love old photographs and was impressed by how many were included in this brief book, it's aptly named ""a photographic story of a life"".I liked the way the author was able to appeal to a broad range of readers by inserting explanations for concepts and words younger readers might not yet know off to the side of the general text of the story. For example abstract, proctor, inauguration and Bachelor of Arts are all defined inside an unobtrusive text box at the edge of a page.I also liked the way the author didn't sugar-coat issues, she included the fact that Annie Sullivan had detractors and at one point Helen was separated from Annie in an attempt to protect Helen. I found this book very interesting and informative and would recommend it to young and old alike."
4,Book review from an 11 year old,I thought that this book was pretty good. I am not much of a person who reads biographies but I thought that it was very informative about Hellen Keller's life and it made a good read.
3,"Great pictures, one flaw","I almost always read through all of the books before I give them to my children, and I am glad I did. While it is a wonderful book for the reason I bought it - the many photographs - it also has one page that just is not necessary in a children's book. It talks about Helen advocating for mandatory silver nitrate drops in the eyes of newborns. No problem there, but did it have to say, to prevent damage from Syphillis, a sexually transmitted disease? I don't want to have to explain that to my 10 year old, or my 7 year old!"
2,Not blue...,"I bought this since I was expecting a blue reed guard and instead got a black one. I complained that I also got a La Voz instead of the D'Addario, however I read the product description and it did say La Voz. However not one word about the color.Does it hold reeds?Yes.Is it what I expected?No.So why the low stars you may ask?Simple, I bought this only because I wanted a blue one, thinking ""I never saw a blue one, that would be so cool"" just to get a black one."
4,"Great headphones, as long as you don't have a fat head","These are the most comfortable, and fragile, headphones I've ever owned. The design is unique. The sound is well above average, decent lows and mids, treble is a little muddy. It's true what everyone says. The tension that keeps these headphones on your ears and off your neck comrs from a thin piece of clear, easily breakable plastic, so don't get them if you can't treat them carefully or have a big head. For me, they rest on a hook above the ground. The cable is relatively short, so they are better for mp3 players, music phones, headphone cable extenders, or bluetooth remote audio gateways (which is what I use it mainly for). Definitely worth the $15 I paid for them."
1,They break!,"I bought three pair. All three have broken at the back of the band. I was able to use some strong tape to hold them together, but now they look terrible, and they slip off easily."
1,false advertising -- not for exercise,"The Logitech Curve headphones are marketed as being ideal for the runner/excersizer to use with an iPod or other MP3 player. But after running with the headphones only twice, the foam pads slid off and were impossible to put back on. This rendered them useless."
5,Love it!,"I am not a cook, don't enjoy cooking, but I love this pot! It cooks very well, it's great for making soups and casseroles. It cleans very easily. Things I make that I used to use a skillet, then another pot or pan, I can do it all here! It's a perfect size. I looked for a long time for a pot this size, received this as a gift, and I will definitely be purchasing more Calphalon products. Very impressed with the quality versatility, and practicallity. Perfect for cooking for a family."
3,never received item as not able to ship to po box.,"order was canceled by seller as not able to ship to po box. so I never received this item, not sure why it is showing up for review?"
5,Great Product,"This is a great product. All of my favorite artists, singing beautifully in worship. I would certainly recommend this product to anyone!"
5,Love it!,"Love it, love it, love it! My children love it! We all listen to it when we sleep! We all sleep better! I leave the CD player on repeat...it is nice to hear worship playing through the house all day and all night!"
5,Beautiful!,"I love this CD, it is so beautifully done. It is calm and relaxing but fun and inspiring! Love to have it in the car and playing in my living room when its time to calm down!"
5,Great for Soaking,"If you like to ""soak"" in God's presence, this is a lovely album to put on for those quiet times. Every song is gentle and tender, so it's easy to quiet myself before the Lord when I put this CD on. I don't have kids, so I can't vouch for the songs as lullabies."
3,lullibyes?,so when i think lullibyes the druums dont really come to my mind. the only endearing thing about this cd is nicole nordeman who is really good! but she only sings about 4 songs on the cd so... also what is with Christian music nowadays? it has gotten so shallow and they end up just saying the same thing over and over like a chant almost. i hate to say it but i am so tired of songs that say hallelujah and nothing else. writers have gotten lazy! God is awesome enough to have a new song sung to Him. i too would like to hear it!
3,"Good as a reference book, but be Warned!","This book was one of the first books on a segment of the Taoist arts to reach the west and to that I give Mantak Chia high praise. The book deals with the energy circulation within the body. It is written in a easy to follow style (for such a subject).After studing the internal arts for years I find this book a good reference book. Unfortunately I believe this book is actually bad for anyone who is new to the subject. DOING ANY OF THE EXERCISES WRONG CAN HAVE TERRIBLE EFFECTS ON YOU.To any person who is new to qi gong/internal arts I say this book is not for you and you should first find a GOOD teacher to study under. For people who are already familiar with the study, this is a good reference book to have in your collection."
1,Say what!,"I read the book and feel it can be summarized as follows: ""Think good thoughts and direct them at your navel. Sit up straight when you do so. Be careful, your navel is going to just burn up with energy. This energy is good for you."" And it says this over and over again in 193 pages. Clearly I'm missing something (I hope). I'm relying on other readers to clarify what I missed."
2,Dissapointing,"I have been hesitant to review this book for a long time.This is a very rudimentary book that deals almost exclusively with the small circulation or sometimes called the Small Uiverse.The author used incorrect termininology for the Conception Qi vessel, and is unaware of the difference between Qi vessels and meridians."
4,This book is small,"This is the first and only Mankak Chia book that I have as yet. It's good for the little details that other people and books might confuse - like which hand to use to closing the orbit. I really wish that this book had more information, especially about the orbit as it goes through the legs and arms. I have come back and added a star to my review as I realised that Mantak is such a reliable source that it makes reading other sources on the microcosmic orbit much more lucid. My tan tien is not at my navel though."
4,Slightly different,master Chia draws in energy directly thru the third eye for the microcosmic orbit which may be questionable. Outer energy is not cleansed and to draw it thru your wisdom point does not seem wise. The chinese texts I have read first cleanse the energy before raising it to the third eye.
5,Microcosmic orbit,"No other book offers you a complete and clearer instruction about circulating your energy through the microcosmic orbit, which is the basis of the whole chi kung sistem."
3,Delightfully Frustrating!,"Not having read the previous books, Lovesong and Wondsong, I was a little lost when I began reading. Although, Nightsong has a unique story all on its own and the fact that I hadn't read the previous two, made no difference at all. If you enjoy a book full of adventure, jealousy, and one that frustrates you to no end, then this is the book for you. If I found the first two i would love to read them and put together the clues I didn't understand in Nightsong. Overall, this book was a well written, suspensful, romance novel. :)"
1,Not Good For MEDIA USE or PRICE,"Purchased This product thinking same as silver top , I dont know but this does not truely give you data return , you can store data in media format using pc or mac version used multiple burn speeds and software programs upon playing a media file it would either not load or it would become choppy and freezes not worth the price out of 100 dvd burned I have 23 disc left all 67 disc are a waste .do not buy this dvd-r printable format trust me ."
2,What is going on here?,"I too purchased this 100pk thinking it was a good deal. ($1 each) I used memorex regular dvd-r without a problem for months so i just assumed they would be of the same quality. Well they are NOT! Unfortunately, the end of the DVD is always crap. Whether it be a backed up movie or Data, The end of the DVD is a no burn zone! I called memorex on their warranty and they said they would value their warranty but i would have to send the defective back to be replaced. So that means i have to waste my time and check each one by one and put them to the side if they are bad? that's a good hour waste of burning!(4x)I purchased the printable because my printer has the print directly on disks capability. I guess im just going to have to look elsewhere unfortunately, and i suggest you do the same! I mean, look at all these reviews!"
1,Low quality for the brandname,"Before I purchased this spindel of DVD-Rs, I had a 50x spindel that was also Memorex. The previous (non-printable) DVD-Rs worked great, but these ones are horrible. So far I have tried to make 10 backups of my movies and NONE of them have worked. I had a couple of the previous batch of DVD-Rs and tried them and they worked great.Don't waste your money on these!!"
2,Not the same as the silver topped Memorex DVD-Rs,Purchased these thinking they would be the same as the silver topped memorex discs. Not so. I use a DVD duplicator tower to copy hundreds of DVD movies (ones I own the rights to). Sent the discs off to customer's only to have reported problems with them being read halfway through the movie. It's just not a common occurance but has been reported several times. I use all Pioneer DVR-A06 writers. When using the silver topped writable discs I have no problems. We need to have some 100 packs of those available (Memorex or whoever!)
1,White Coasters,"I too have a Pioneer TiVo (DVR-57H) but unlike the other reviewer have had little success with these disks. The disks seem to burn just fine, but have problems in playback. Usually the early part of the recording is fine, but latter half is choppy, and eventually ceases to play.I have had great success with the Memorex silver top disks(also CMC MAC AF1), but for some reason neither my TiVo or my PC like these white top disks.I would suggest buying these in smaller quantities until you know they work with your equipment. Buyer beware!"
1,Recording side bad? So is the print side!,"These print surface on these discs are completely unacceptable for my commercial needs. Memorex has used some type of rubbery glue-like substance on the print surface. I presume its purpose is to improve ink adhesion. However, the substance itself rubs off with very little effort. Its even worse if your fingers are at all wet or sweaty.I first noticed this while placing a printed DVD back into its case. I thought the printer ink was the cause at first, perhaps some wort of reaction with the surface. However, after some experimentation with some unprinted DVDs, I have concluded that the print surface itself was to blame.If you're really careful, you may never have this problem. But for commercial use, I can't risk the trouble. I'm guessing most people would never expect the printing to be so sensitive."
4,Excellent Value once firmware is updated........,"Once I updated my firmware on my 1x Pioneer DVD drive, there were zero problems. Important note on the spindle states ""Attn: Firmware update needed in DVD-R/RW drive is 1X or 2X "" I've burned 35 discs so far and not one has failed. Memorex has it right!"
1,DVD-R Printable Write Error w/Sony DVD Burner,"I have a DW-U10A & DRU-510A Sony Burner. I get write errors with both of them...firmware has been upgraded. Changed DMA settings, errors went away but DVD is still not playable. I've made about a dozen coasters and have contacted Memorex for replacement. I do not have any problems burning regular Memorex DVD-R or DVD+R...just the printables ones.I had to give it 1 stars because 0 starts is not available."
1,90% Coasters,I burned 25/25 discs with NO errors whatsoever on the standard memorex 4x DVD-R's they sell at Best Buy. These however burn all the way till 99% then fail. It's really annoying that these actually ended up costing more than the ones at a retail store (because it takes 5-10 just to get a good disc). I'll never order these again.
1,These are not worth your time or money!,"Also getting watermarks, especially if there is *any* minor dust on the surface when burning. Using a TDK Indi 440n with the latest firmware and still getting read errors on the 10 or so discs that I've tried. Getting read errors on 2 PC dvd rom drives and skipping on my Sony DVD player. Avoid these at all costs!"
3,"Memorex are ""seen"" differently-apparantly","I had similar problems- would work on shorter projects, but on longer ones (near the end of the disk) BIG problems!After about 25 ruined disks, (and contacting Pioneer), I found that if I changed the burning speed to the burner rate (in my case, 2x, instead of ""auto""), the problems went away.Seems like the info that the burner ""sees"" to determine isn't so accurate at the end of the disk-- no sure, but since I have burned over 150 without problems.I'm now ordering more."
1,Great coasters,$100 for a product that 66% of the time does not complete writing the data. I got about 30 good copies out of 100 discs
1,these blank dvd are crap,i ordered these blank dvd hoping to use them with no problem. wrong so far i used 25 only six have been useable.I get bad video poor audio i have wasted my money .I'll never buy any memorex ever again..I have tried them in 3 different burners. Never again
2,Does not burn with Pioneer 105 with firmware 1.33,"I loved the price--I use the silver top 4x memorex discs which have the same manufacture code as the printable dvd discs; however, much like the reviewer with the pioneer dvr 106 drive, my discs indicate a successful burn but do not play all the way through and the purple surface looks blurry and smeared. I have tried burning these discs at 1x but I have the same results.If these were identical in reliability to the non-printable silver tops, I would be giving 5 stars no problem. Had I read the review from the Pioneer 106 user, I would not have purchased the discs.If these discs work in your machine--great. At half price and no shipping this is a great value.I hate to bring down the rating but if I can save someone hours of heartache--its worth it."
1,Defective Item,Just bought Media assuming that Memorex DVD-R Media would work because the silver top model worked. Tried to archive a DVD Movie 5 times. Archived DVD plays until it can't be read halfway through the movie. Don't buy this item!!!!!
1,Not compatible with Pioneer DVR's,"Unbeknownst to this purchaser when this spindle arrives, there is a little note on top saying the product may cause damage to certain models of Pioneer computer and component DVRs. A fix is available but even though my model was not listed and I CONFIRMED with Pioneer that they were to work on my model, no dice. It damaged the DVR recorder, thankfully not irreperably.Buy TDK or Sony."
5,Works great for me,"I don't normally write reviews, but since so many people had trouble burning with these, I'll note that my Asus DRW-0402P has had no problem burning these at 4x. And the printed labels look quite nice, too (I use an Epson R200)."
5,"Good product, good service, but poor packaging",The discs are in good quality and reliable. Shipping is quick. The whole transaction went smothly. My only displeasure is packaging. The spindle DVD disc pack was placed inside a carton box stuffed with airbags. Airbags deflated. Discs are thrown all over in the container. It happened two out of two shippings.
3,,"Out of the pack of 100 I bought, about 5 wouldn't burn and about another 5 would have artifacts and glitches in the video. I never had a problem when using them for data backup. I have a Mac Super Drive (PIONEER DVD-RW DVR-105) and use DVD Studio Pro, Fast DVD Copy and Toast 6.0. I would recommend these. Just make sure you update all of your firmware and make sure your burner is compatible."
1,Not this one..,"Wasted a lot with writer throwing ""Power Calibration Error"" after 2% write. Previous lot was OK...but not this one. Go for something else."
3,"Some work, some don't, wonder why?","I have been using Memorex media for years, and this is the first media that I have had a slight problem with. I don't know if it is the recording part or the printing part that is causing some of my discs not to work. I have a dual burner and it does the +R printable with no problems, but the -R seems to have problems when it plays about half the movie. It starts to freeze up and do strange things. I talked to a friend and he said I probably just have a bad batch. I am going to order replacements and see if the problem is still there. Has anyone else had a problem before they printed the discs with the playback. On some of my disc it works fine before I print it, and not after I print it on my Epson 900 printer? It's kinda expensive and time consuming to sort this out, but atleast the discs are covered under warranty. The ones that do work, work great. But it takes so much time to find out the ones that don't."
1,Did not work with my new Panasonic burner,I have used many Memorex disks with good results. However this type would not work on my new Panasonic DVD burner. I sent them back.
3,Can't hardly remember,This was bought a long time ago but I do recall that these discs were ok but I found better discs to work with.
3,Military SF's Answer to the Hardy Boys,"The introduction was imaginative and held me in rapt state of attention. However, fifty pages later it was clear how the book would end and the book became a chore to finish.The characters are clean cut and represent themselves well. Their society is orderly, envision clipped green hedges and tidy lawns. The cause is fair and just, representing higher, but not unreasonable, ideals. The story, like the characters, reflects an array of stable and secure ideals, comfortable in their superiority.On the plus side, the book is well written and the characters, in their sterile world, are complete. They just don't seem real.No plot twists, no surprises, just a cadre of good men fighting the unimaginative, but very tidy, good fight.3 stars, no surprise:)"
3,Timeless Love,I like the book but that's about all I can say. It wasn't the best book in the world and when i bought it I was hoping for alot more. Sam was just to predictable and it seemed the boring parts took up the most of the book and the things that she really could have developed more were over in a flash. The romance just happened to quick and while i enjoyed it she could have devloped the relationship more. The ending was overly happy and if she would have extened it to create a second part of the story then it might have been interesting oh well.It was a good read just don't expect to much.
3,Well...,"I read this book when I was 12 or 13 and it wasn't too bad. I remember it being witty and entertaining, don't expect anything too thought provoking though.I wouldn't suggest this for anyone over 14 since it's a bit of an easy read and rather fluffy. (And not good fluffy like Old Magic, just boring fluffy.)"
4,"Over All, a Good Read","I thought Timeless Love was a good book because of the detail. Although the romance between Sam and Barnaby happened a bit fast. It really wasn't a real year long romance, just a beginning. That is probably why O'Brien wrote the ending the way she did. The book was a little over detalied in parts, but at least that painted a picture in your mind about what it like to be in whatever situation Sam was in. I would recommend this book to most teens who would like some laughs with a historical setting."
2,Okay,This really could have been a good book but to tell you the truth i was quite a dissapointed. The love story was sort of nice but also really predictable. The main character was annoying and some times just a complete idiot. The only reason i gave this 2 stars is that i like books that mix history with fiction and the auther did a good job at that. Read this book if you would like to but if you enjoy to have a character that you can relate to and a story that is surprising find another book.
2,Timeless Bore,"Timeless Love, at first glance, seems like a cool book with an interesting premise. That's the reason I bought it. But unfortunately, it was extremely disappointing. It was chock full of lame ideas and not very well written. The cliches and sadly overused plot points were insufferable. It bored me half to death and I barely finished it. That's too bad, because in the hands of someone else, the book might have been really great. I don't recommend it."
1,Very generic!,"Though there was nothing technically inaccurate, this book leaves a lot to be desired. I was expecting a lot more from ""The Official"" guide. I was also dissappointed to find so many of the ""Reviews"" written by people directly involved with the authors' company RYNO (a little research uncovered that Bob Britz is a Vice President for Steve Kaplan)."
1,You're better off with natural plain grape seed oil,"These are full of chemicals and crap and expensive too. I should have bought plain grape seep oil (the best alternative) and added essential oils as needed. All natural, and much much cheaper alternative."
2,Its alright.,"We really only like 1 of the 5 scents which is why I'm only giving it 2 stars, but we do really like that scent and have used most of it."
4,Great sampler,"I like the oil, I just don't care for some of the fragrances. I enjoy earthy, spicy smells, and two of the 5 fit the bill and I've been enjoying them a lot. But the other two were really floral and sweet, which are things I usually don't care for at all in a fragrance. The fifth is almond scented, which is practically unscented (not that this is a cheap product, but that almond fragrance is very mild). I will definitely order more oil from this company, and I'm happy I tried the sampler before buying a full bottle of any one fragrance. The oils themselves are very slick without being too heavy, and they absorb well into the skin."
4,"Great product, not great for sensitive skin","I have very sensitive skin and break out with pretty much any oil or fragrance, so it was no surprise that these oils had that very effect on me. However, they work and smell great, so if you don't have that problem, it would be a fantastic product!"
5,A must have if you are intimate with anyone.,The lotions last forever and the multiple scents allow the massages to not going old and repetitive. There is enough oil for about 100 sessions and its not that messy... The Oil does not irritate the area below... THIS STUFF IS GREAT
2,...,"Toy is much larger than expected. It does not have an off switch! Just walking by this toy will activate its roar and glowing eyes - not something you want to experience during the night! My 5 yr. old played a lot with it for the first 2 weeks or so, now it basically just sits there. It was half off online, otherwise I wouldn't say it was worth it. I wouldn't get the other ""fire"" dragon for him."
2,GREAT FLUORIDE FREE water but get the stainless steel one! Cracked and leaking after 2 yrs.,"We have had ours for 2 years and it has developed a crack around the spicket piece that it leaking water. I am currently changing a towel under it once or twice a day until we can afford a replacement. As far as the water quality, its amazing! It does take a long time to filter but you would never notice if you just keep the top full. We leave a pitcher next to it at all times and whenever we notice the top is low we dump a pitcher into it. We have also attched the optional fluoride filters to the carbon filters because fluoride IS VERY TOXIC and SHOULD NOT BE IN OUR DRINKING WATER! That is why we chose Berkely in the first place and will be purchasing another soon, only this time we will go with the stainless steel."
4,Clean water,"Simple and sweet, the water is soft and crystal clear not to mention all the potential bad stuff that's been removed. Compared to my other filtering system there's no comparison to taste etc.. its night and day.The only odd thing is, I was supposed to get several free travel water bottles with my order and they weren't part of the delivery.Never the less I highly recommend this product for those that have concerns about their municipal drinking water, well water or any other source they get the water from."
2,"Filters water, but there are problems","The elements seem good for filtering water, but will not remove flouride. The parts are all very flimsy especially the plastic tap, which seems like it will wear out quickly. The lid is just a nylon cap that slips over the top. For $209 I expected more. BEWARE, you will NOT get the 2 extra elements as stated in the description. I e-mailed a representative of this company, he nicely told me it was a mistake by Amazon that could not be changed. Take that for what it's worth."
4,Outstanding script and action,"Wow, was this movie exciting! The famous story was well designed for screen and the action was riveting! The old special effects are great! Very exciting, and you feel like you are viewing a masterpiece like Gone With The Wind. Sounds of speaking are a bit fuzzy to understand, but it eventually flowed into my ears better. The animal training is amazing. I will enjoy viewing this over and over."
4,"Is this it, finally? Yes!!!","Originally I gave this item a 2-star rating, based solely on previous experience with the title. I risked ordering it, crossing my fingers that at last maybe we'd get a print of the film worthy of its pedigree. I figured that if it was as bad as all other versions I've bought, at least I wouldn't have wasted too much money. Now I've received it and checked it out and FINALLY! A good, restored print. The colors are bright and vivid. The only thing preventing me from giving it a full 5-star rating is the sound, which is a bit muddy. But hey, I'm not complaining! Thank you, DigiComTV, for letting me see this film as I've always wanted to see it!"
3,The Green Hornet,The movie had its funny moments Kato was great I would buy it on dvd because I love my superhero movies but the movie is only so so.
1,very bad..... waste of money,Wow....It was just awful awful movie.Bad casting and still don't understand why does it have to be in 3D.And that Asian actor can not even speak English.They need to find some one who can speak English.
1,This movie is horrible...,"This is the worst adaptation of a serial to date...I had high hopes as Michel Gondry is an amazing director, but Seth Rogan is the person to place blame on here...Assuming writing, producing, and acting roles... You can see that Gondry really had nothing to do with this, and that SR got a big head and F'd it all up.Shame on you Seth Rogan... Take a back seat next time and let a master do his work.Let's hope this doesn't mess Gondry up in the future ala David Lynch and Terry Gilliam..."
1,Worst Movie of all Time,"I cannot even begin to tell you how bad this movie was. Just please, don't even bother to watch it. It insulted my intelligence with the potty-mouth dialog and EXTREMELY POOR ACTING. I am just glad I rented the movie and didn't buy it.PLEASE, if you value your time, don't bother. It is not only a STUPID rendition (the original comic book hero WAS NOT STUPID, but the movie actor made it seem like he was), it is in very poor taste. I will never get those minutes back from watching it. The highlight of that time was when I STOPPED PLAYING THE MOVIE. If you think, as you are watching, that it will get better, think again. IT GETS WORSE.THIS IS ONE SICKENING AND STUPID MOVIE."
1,I Really Tried To Like It.,"One of the worse movies I have ever seen, and that's saying a lot. Seth Rogen is not funny. You might think that would work to his advantage in a film like this. It doesn't. He's not serious, he's not funny, he's not - anything because he tries to be both, and sucks across the board. Sony just killed a potential franchise, and after seeing some of Rogens previous films, I'm done. I will never see a Seth Rogen film again. So how do these no talent guys keep making films? DVD sales I guess. Skip it, because you won't be able to get those two hours back in your life, no matter how hard you try. I have never seen so many people walk out of a movie, except for that time the film broke and everyone wanted their money back. Come to think of it, more walked out on this one. Hey, How do you give no stars?"
1,Green Crap!,"The Green Hornet.........This is a great franchise that they were talking about for a long time and I was looking so foward to it as I enjoyed the series when I was a kid...........I have over a thousand dvd's in my collection,so I'll watch almost anything.......I had little hope when I found out who the leading actor was for this action/comedy,but who knows,I'll give it a chance some actors have changed there movie genre and acted in some really great movies........this is not the case here!........I could barely get through it,it was so bad,poor acting,not funny, boring action...........in fact as the Green Hornet it seemed stupid.........thank god I was watching it on a plane and did not buy it........I did not descrbe anything about the movie because it is forgetable.......rent it if you must but don't buy it........pass it bye,waste of your time lets hope we get a real Green Hornet movie soon."
