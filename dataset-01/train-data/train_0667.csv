5,Dancin' at the Disco!,"Colin you dog. How do you do it? Usually by the third book the characters get paper thin and it seems like the writer is just ""phoning it in.""""Disco"" is even stronger and more fleshed out than the first two books in the series and they are superb. I am even a tougher critic now as I now live in Vientaine and check facts with former (?) Pathet Lao members and those who remember all that happened. No one has anything but the highest regards for your sense of history or accuracy in character. I have been to the hospital where Dr Siri's morgue is supposed to be located. I live in the same neighborhood. No one writes with more depth and feeling for the Lao people than Cotterill.Even if you have no interest in Lao, Dr Siri is a detective that could stoke a pipe with Holmes. Nurse Dtui is more that a Watson.This is a rich and brilliant read about an exciting and deep culture.Have you ever seen a book on Amazon where all the reviewers gave it five stars?"
1,Have not received shipment,Ironic that you ask for a review ....have waited weeks for shipment from your vendor - Tigerfac.Where is my book? What a hassle.
3,Not Many Choices.,"With most of the available two-line phones now being sold as console units that will support many cordless handsets and built in message features, I wanted a plain old, stand alone, two line phone. Like the old record turntables, most of the big manufacturers still offer one or two choices but the pickings are slim. I decided to chose Panasonic based on a mostly positive experience with their products over the years, but it is not a great phone. Good phone, yes. It can be staticy and not so clear from time to time but I always get a signal. The operation sequence for managing the incoming calls has you push one button and the phone will answer what ever line is comming in. This system does not perform well with ""call waiting"". I still don't have it down yet. Fortunatly most people call back if I cut them off.In closing, I had a V-Tech before this that worked great but died after about 14 months. They still make one but the Panasonic seemed a safer choice."
2,"Funtional, yes- Pretty, no!","A real nice phone if you can put up with the cheap silver look and some features. I put it up on the kitchen wall and after 1 day pulled it off.I couldn't stand looking at it. Esthetically sucks. It lacks a whole lot of features that I presently have on my Radio Shack 2 line cordless phone. EG a dial pad on the base with speaker phone, which most perople need. Do not buy a refurbished phone of this type thru an Amazon merchant. They will NOT take it back. Very unhappy with the way it is presented on their website. Let the buyer beware.."
2,Terrible interference with security 2.4MHZ video system,"WORKS VERY WELL AS TELEPHONE BUT MAKES VERY STRONG INTERFERENC WITH 2.4MHZ SECURITY VIDEO SYSTEM IN ALL 4 CHANNELS. HAD TO MAKE CHOICE AND GOT RID OF TELEPHONE.IF YOU DONT HAVE VIDEO SYSTEM ITS OK. IF YOU HAVE 2.4MHZ VIDEO, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,Where has quality gone?,"Works fine, looks and feels ""cheap."" Very few cordless phones with speaker on handset that are wall mountable? Why?"
4,These Curtains Serve the Purpose,"These curtains are super easy to install, although there is no easy way to adjust for minor length changes (be prepared for the puddle look.) you should also be prepared to spend some time ironing out creases. Color was as I had hoped but one of the units came in and looked like a completely different dye lot. This was ok for me because I was alternating 2 colors for my window treatment. The overall look is good but to the touch they are a bit on the stiff side. All said, I am happy with the final look"
3,An adequate reference,"I bought this book to help me study for my licensing exam. It is useful because it is a concise and easy reference. What I had hoped it would have, but didn't, is more comprehensive references for clinical modalities and for clinicians who had pioneered those modalities."
5,The best of the new generation of spain rock-pop stars,"A really excelent choice for those who like the dark, soul,James Brown inspired american rock-soul music.This guy is realy the making good music."
1,False Advertising,"The CD I received, was not the one shown here. It was with white gospel singers and a few blacks, but it was not what I ordered. However, the one depicted here is old time gospel, which I wish I could have."
2,"2 stars for anyone else, for Thomas Mann this is a 5","This was the first book I ever read by Thomas Mann, and I was proud and amazed that I'd gotten through the whole thing. In fact I still am. Then I attempted some of his other stuff and I found out that by comparison ""Felix Krull"" is a laugh riot. Actully, to a modern reader ""Krull"" is pretty tepid. Any post WWII book will be more lively. But if you want to say you've read one of Mann's novels as a badge of honor, this one is least painful."
3,"Thought provoking, but not quite what the doctor ordered...","Let's just say that this book stated the obvious. If you are a minority, the title grabs you, but it does not give much advice that would differ from other books. It shows a list of the different types of doctors and their current salaries as well as how long the residency would last. Helpful, but I could've gotten that information from anywhere. They go on to categorize the medical schools by price. I fail to see what this has to do with minorities. However, I did enjoy reading the book and was grateful that such a book was available."
2,a little outdated and not really specific to minorities,"I agree with the first reviewer; this book doesn't offer that much more than other books out there regarding getting into medical school. And like most other books, the section on combined degree programs really lacks insightful information, particularly regarding applying to MD/PhD programs. Also, some of the information is out dated and obsolete. ""MMEP"" is an obsolete term and has been replaced in name by ""SMDEP."" Also, there are a number of other programs mentioned that are simply no longer available. There's really nothing spectacular about this book. The process of getting into medical school nowadays for minority applicants really isn't all that different from majority applicants. The standards are just as high, especially for the top medical schools. At best, the useful information in this book that's specific to minority students could amount to a few chapters in a more all inclusive book."
4,"Great features & sound quality, cheap plastic","I purchased this microphone just prior to taking off on a two-week video shoot in SE Asia. I was a bit apprehensive about relying so heavily on a mic about which I wasn't able to get much information before purchasing. After having used the mic quite extensively for a couple of weeks, I can now breathe a sigh of relief and report that overall this is a very good microphone for the price. Its selection of frequencies and other user-changeable features are good, though its menu system is not intuitive and requires keeping the manual close by.My main criticism is its cheap plastic construction, typical with Sony products at this price point. It only took a few days to break the ""foot"" on the shoe mount.Overall, I am relatively happy with this purchase and would recommend this mic, but I would also strongly recommend a good hard case in which to store it (no case is included)."
4,it works,Filters the air quite well. has a anti-microbial protection on it. took off one star for no charcoal filter and for the edges being a bit flimsy. for the price you cannot beat it. installed on a 2006 Scion Xb
5,It's a cabin air filter...,Replaced my cabin air filter for my 06 Scion TC with this one. Matched up in size and fit in neatly and snug as a bug in a rug. Less than 2 minutes to install and I saved 5.00+ by ordering it from Amazon.com. Love it!
1,Very poor quality,I was attracted to this product because it was less expensive compared to the dealer price and the independent parts store price. I was not happy with how flimsy the filter is and it was very difficult to install. I had to trim it and reinforce it with cardboard before I could make it fit. I will not purchase it again.
4,"Good chain , nice price","I have a Husqvarna 359 saw that take this chain. It has good life on the chain and I do not have any kick back problems. The only problem I have had is when the chain fell off the bar it hit the guard and bent the teeth, but the is a safety feature of the saw having a metal guard."
2,Hound Dog Grass Clipper,"I expected the wheels to be bigger.....they are so small they are useless and I wind up carrying it to clip afterall, which defeats the purpose. The handle could be longer, too. Overall, it's not like the one I had years ago and I'm disappointed."
4,Hound Dog bites grass,"Y'know those dings in the fence and tree bark made by your weed whacker?Well, Hound Dog doesn't make those marks. It trims grass quite nicely...even in hard to reach places, like between the deck and fence.Where it falls a bit short is with weeds that have heavier stalks.It WILL cut them, but you will have to work at it.And, if your left-handed and unable to adapt to right-handed tools, well, this one is definitely for righties only.Overall, its a great tool...saves energy, saves back breakingbending-over, gets the neighbors to stop and ask where you got it,and saves big money on replacing scarred decking, fencing, trees, etc.And its so very adjustable that it will work for just about anyone.Get one."
3,A Good Gardening Tool,"This is exactly what the description says. It is sharp, light weight, and easy to handle. However, the wheel is too small and you will have to lift it in order to cut the grass. It's murder on my fingers because the pressure I use to cut the grass causes me to get callouses. If you have minor grass cutting then this is the perfect tool."
5,Everything you wanted to know about this lesser know Breed.,"An excellent starting place for information regarding this lesser know breed. Very helpful and informative. It answered more than a few questions we had regarding our dog's behavior. If you have a Belgain Sheepdog, this book is a must. If you are considering the breed, read this book FIRST."
3,I'm Jimmy Reed,"These are all great cuts, but very poorly remastered in my opinion. The treble is boosted; there is not enough bass; there is the addition of echo (or maybe reverb) on Jimmy's vocals; and the the speed seems a little off as well. The ""feel"" of Jimmy's music has been lost in all this. I own all the original JR 45's, & several cd collections. I bought this because I did not have a good digital version of the original Little Rain. I still don't. I am very disappointed - especially considering that this is released under the Vee Jay name."
1,Two Words Come To Mind,"Yes, folks, that's right. Two little words come to mind when I see this very, very, innovative product: ""Snake"" and ""Oil.""A normal ASCII keyboard has everything you need: space bar, X, C, V, J (Snap rotate), QWERTY keys, F1 - F11, 1 - 7 keys, ALT, SHIFT, Delete, CTRL, Insert, <, >, and arrows.The only thing you might want to do to modify your $20 keyboard is remove the Caps Lock key.And with that knowledge, I have just saved all of you $140. So let's split the difference, and you can each mail me $70 for posting this review.Some inventions are best left on the drawing table."
3,Cute flashlight,"I bought this for my 1 year old nephew. It's a bigger size for his little hands and seems sturdy. The only concern i have is the light, which is very strong and stays on for about one minute after pressing the inside of the handle. It can actually be used as a flashlight. I looked directly at the front while the light was on and it bothered my eyes so I will let my sister know. It appears easy enough to take the bulb out, but will require a screw driver. I still like it and rather do that then return it or take the batteries out because it makes a cute sound. I know he will like it because he enjoyed playing with thomas trains at the toy store recently, but the regular size trains are i think too small for him right now."
4,Eats batteries,We love Thomas and this flashlight is a very well made toy. It has been a hit since we purchased it for DS's b'day.I expected a flashlight to eat batteries but this one REALLY goes through them. So we resorted to rechargables.DS sleeps with this flashlight nightly.
5,A kid-attracter,"My nephew loved this toy! He already likes Thomas, so he kept coming back to this toy after he opened his other birthday gifts. Only problem was that we couldn't find an off button (his mom may hate me later for that!). We got our giggles when it would make it's train noises every time we came to a stoplight and the toy shifted in the back seat."
3,"good, not great toy","My son got this as a present for his second birthday. He loves trains and this was a thoughtful present for him. It lights up and makes the right noise for him to like it. However, the adults in the room got annoyed with it because it made train noises every time someone stepped on the floor across the room. It's very sensitive! We eventually had to move it because it wouldn't stop. It's a fine noise/light toy, but really doesn't have any benefits beyond that."
2,"Cool toy, but not at all durable","My son got one of these for Christmas and within 2 weeks it wasn't working. We got the receipt and exchanged it. That one worked for a few months. This year, someone else gave him the exact same flashlight and it already only works sporadically at best.We kept the toy because even though it didn't work, he likes to play with Thomas and push him around, but it's a pretty expensive push toy."
5,The BEST ever!!!,I got addicted to this series first by renting a few videos. I had to buy it. This series is worth every penny! I have told everyone I know to get it.
5,24 - Seasons 1-3,"All 3 seasons were superb! Even though I am not particularly fond of spy stories, 24 keeps you at the edge of your seat every hour. The premise is that the action takes place in a 24 hour period which makes one whole season, therefore each season has 6 DVDs of action. You certainly will get your money's worth!!! There are so many twists and turns to the story line, I was shocked each time (that's all I'll say because you must see it to believe it). It is indeed one of the very BEST TV shows I have ever seen. One word of caution though---this is not for children because there are some violent scenes and shocking action."
5,Is this what a heroin addiction feels like?,"I never knew I could master so many remote controls with such speed and accuracy as I go from one hour to the next, from one season to the next. I heard all the buzz about 24, but never saw even one episode. Anyway, I finally bought the first year on DVD just a few weeks ago. I bought the rest of the available seasons, 2-4, before I had even finished the first! I am almost finished with season 3 and my wife comments that this proves that I do in fact have time to go to the gym. Curse you 24! There is no way I will ever watch this series except on DVD, I simply couldn't take the wait between episodes.More. I want more. Give me more. NOW! I NEED MY FIX!!!"
5,24 The first three seasons,"I didn't start watching '24' until half way into the 4th season. I quickly became addicted. I anxiously awaited each week for the new episode. I purchased the first three seasons so I could catch up. I absolutely loved them. I hope the 4th season is made available soon.I received my order in a timely fashion and in good condition. Given the enjoyment I've received, it was money well spent."
4,Positive review,I enjoyed the After Dark Games. I was looking for this software and I finally found it. It is a past time for me.
1,After Dark Games,I was very disappointed with this purchase. I purchased it because it was suppose to be compatible with Windows XP and the CD that I received was not. My nieces and nephews were visiting and they were all set to use the video games and it would not work.
5,Marvy-lous brush,Works like a champ and doesn't shed like the others I've tried. For the price a great piece of shaving equipment.
4,Decent Entry Boar's Hair Brush,"I'm not sure why this little brush received so many negative reviews. First of all, when getting a new brush, it is best to wash it a few times with shampoo and hot water, and finish with a mild conditioner. Then rinse the brush thoroughly. This will help eliminate future shedding. Also, as with any shave brush, it is absolutely necessary to dry the brush with the bristles pointing down. I would assume other user's issues with shedding resulted from poor conditioning/care of their brush upon arrival. Secondly, boar hair brushes become better at lathering as time passes. The hairs split (not break) down middle, giving you a greater amount of lather capacity, and increasing the softness of the brush slightly. Granted, this is not at all a contender with the badger and boar brushes costing upwards of $50 or more, but it is a great little starting brush, or a travel brush. My one star reduction comes from the somewhat cheap looking handle on this brush."
1,CHEAP JUNK,"I used this brush one time and the bristles popped out of the plastic base that they have not been adequately secured within. They used an inferior type of glue that is brittle and not in adequate quantity to hold the bristles in the handle. The bristles go into the handle about 1/4 inch, and the small black ring in the image is beveled inward, forming a small ring of plastic that is designed to hold the bristles in with the adhesive that they used. The plastic handle is also hollow and the sticker that is on the outside in the image came off as I was using the brush.I highly recommend NOT purchasing this brush due to the lowest quality of manufacture possible."
1,I was schocked,"I bought this shaving brush in DC when I lost mine with my luggage. The first time I used it the base came off, but the hotel had some epoxy to reattach the handle. The third day, bristles started comming out. By the final day of my trip the brush was missing 40% of the bristles. If you think about this brush lasting about a week, then it is very much more expensive than a better quality brush.A couple more dollars to attach the bristles and secure the handle and they could have a great inexpensive product. The quality was so poor that I am actually shocked to see that Amazon os allowing it to be sold on their site.Unless you want a onetime novelity item, avoid this ""Shaving Brush"""
1,Brush,"I will not recommend this brush to any one,the hair keep folin off when soaping the face,atthend of ten shves noting is left."
3,Almost there,"The sound of the cymbal is great, but it never gets loud enough no matter how hard you strike it. It's like it starts to decay right when hit."
2,meh,"Lost two lbs, just go with a regular protein this is a waste. I am a hard gainer, I eat 4 meals a day 4 protein shakes and added this to drink in the am and post work out."
3,this is gainer that really makes u gain weight.,i have to say this is one of the only gainers i really get. the bad of this is that its extremely thick and u need a blunder to mix it so u dont taste the chunks which makes it inconvenient to take it on the go. ull gain weight fast if u take this least twice a day but runs out quickly. this is good for short term weight gain wouldnt rely too much on a gainer.
3,Tasty but disappointing results,When I began to use this mass gainer I was very impressed. I bought the Chocolate and the flavor couldn't be any better. It tasted better than Nesquick. And I gained 5 pounds in two weeks. But that was it. After I gained 5 pounds I didn't gain much more. So I was rather disappointed in the long term results.
4,It works!,"I've been taking Serious Mass (only half a serving per day) for about a week now and I've gained 5 lbs! I have been trying to gain weight forever and have taken other proteins as well. It's not the best tasting and it doesn't mix very well, but it works! I usually take one scoop of this (scoops are massive btw) and mix it with a scoop of 100% Whey by Cytosport. This makes it taste a lot better. It definitely will make you gain weight, and you'll see results almost immediately!"
3,Average,"When it comes to calorie count in carb+protein powder, 1250 a serve seems like a good deal. But I quickly found that these sort of numbers come at a price in terms of ease of drinkability. It's thick, and the taste of carbs (aka maltodextrin derived from corn) was thick and floury. I felt quite sick after finishing it, but I have a weak stomach so your milage may vary. ON's Pro Complex Gainer seems like a better choice. It's a bit of a cal drop but far more palatable."
3,Typical Gainer - Good Price,"First off. Nowhere in the preduct description does it say the size of the scoop. Serving size is ""2 heaping scoops."" The scoop is 118g! Not a huge problem but a little heads up would have been nice. Maybe ON could take out a little of the flavor and make the scoop smaller. Also, it doesn't mix very well. A shaker with a blender ball works ok if you don't mind downing a few large chunks o' powder. If you do mind then a blender is necessary. The bag is resealable which is good but I recommend dumping it into plastic tub. Everytime you open the bag a large puff of wasted protein covers your kitchen counters. Otherwise it is a good product. I gained 8lbs in first 7days! I had been stuck at my previous weight for 2 weeks."
3,tastes good serving size is HUGE,Bought for my husband says it tastes good was disappointed in serving size! portions are approx 4 servings per container! however my husband uses less
4,I LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE THIS!,"Effectivness: 8/10 I started takign it when I was 160lbs. Within a month and a half I had increased to 175lbs.Taste:6/10 The taste was decent. I added banana to this protein shake to improve the taste of the product.In other news I increased Strength in all of my workouts by up to 20-30lbs on almost every workout.Bench went from 175lbs to 210lbs withing a month and a half.On top of taking this product I also took Jack3d, a preworkout supp."
2,Gave me watery saliva..,"I've been taking it for like a month, gained about 5lbs.However, after taking it, my saliva turned super watery (like I was about to throw up, but I did not have a throw up feeling), and I've got a taste in my saliva the whole day. I cannot describe the taste, but there should not be any taste in my saliva I suppose. These side effects did not make me sick but I just dislike the uncomfortable taste and watery saliva in my mouth, so I stopped taking this product.In conclusion, I did gain 5lbs in a month, but I just can't stand with the side effects. This is the review for me, it might work for you tho. I'll give it 2 stars."
3,Built roughly 10 pounds in 2 weeks! Some fat though...,"With 3 cups of skim milk and 3 tbsp of peanut butter, it tastes like a Reese's shake. It comes to be about 1800 cals, but only 1500 without the peanut butter. Downside is your body fat increases too. I used this to bring me to a 4000 calorie diet."
1,ug,"Tastes horrible (which is ridiculous considering it's all maltodextrin and artificial sweeteners), instant headache as I'm sitting here not even 1/2 through a single scoop mixed with milk...... and the kicker is the giant horse-feed scoop they want you to use, which is only half of a serving... so it looks great on paper, until you find out that this 6 pound container only has 8 servings."
2,Nearly Impossible To Mix Properly,"I have never had such a difficult time mixing a protein drink as I have with this product. It is clumpy unless you put it in a blender, but then it gets all foamy, plus it leaves a residue in the blender than isn't easy to rinse out. The taste isn't all that bad, it does have an eggy flavor to it though. I would not buy this again, I have had better luck mixing the Cytogainer product and will probably get that next time."
1,What,Not the best even though it was a big 12 pounder. Looking for another mass gainer but it does taste decent.
2,Open Product,the serious mas was open and it has just like 6 pounds. I want to change it for a new one
1,Made Me Sick!,"I thought I would try this product for a change as I have been buying the Optimum whey protein powder and creatine for over a year and like both immensely.Serious Mass was not what I had hoped. It upset my stomach tremendously, gave me abdominal cramps and the runs. I've thrown the rest of the bag in the garbage."
4,A Big Bag with Big Portions,"I'll confirm this stuff tastes great (chocolate flavor). The bag is 12 pounds; however, you will run through this stuff very fast. The serving size is about 2 cups of powder. So be prepared to put a little water in a shaker at a time. I'd recommend using a blender for this stuff. When looking at this product I was hoping it would last a long time (because it was 12 pounds), even using half a serving size you'll go through it quick. However, it's great for bulking up!"
2,Having constipation!,"I want to put on some weight, got this product after reading through the comments. It's been a week now using this product. The first day, I took the protein with 1/2 a serving (one scoop) with milk, and used electric mixer. I had diarrhea that night as well as the next day. Wasn't good. I stopped using it for 2 days. Thought I can start again without problem. Now I realized I'm having constipation although I mix it only with water. I don't know what to say. Is it only me?"
2,"taste: not so good, 2 heaping scoops. and they werent kidding","i had the banana flavor. and heres my breakdown.pros: yes its cheap. yes it'll give u a ton of calories to put on weight.to me, it ends there.cons: taste was one of the worse ive tried. ive had ON, BSN Syntha. i'd rank Syntha, then ON, then.. this trails far far behind. size of scoops, each serving consisted of these massive 300g+, so yes, it definitely help you gain weight though. i tried mixing with milk, and banana, neither of which worked, i tried adding some chocolate. not so hot.i would not recommend any of my friends to pick this up even as this is dirt cheap. but for those of you who want to save some $$, this could be a decent choice. but be warned, imo, the taste was rough to swallow. you literally have to just chug it. then go eat something to get the aftertaste off your mouth. (it probably help the cause of weight gainer i guess?)"
1,2 Bags were opened when I received them,"I have been ordering this product for a long time and I love it. However, the last time I ordered 2 12 lb. bags, they were both opened when I received them. At least 20% of the product had spilled into the shipping box. I had no choice but to dispose of 24 lbs. of Serious Mass. The manufacturer of this product does a good job, but the distributor must have cut the bags with a box cutter and ruined it."
2,Attention!,This tastes nothing like the optimum nutrition protein powder. Mine tastes so rancid I have to hold my nose to get it down... should have just bought more whey.
2,Keep in mind,"The scooper that comes with this thing is HUGE! about 1 cup size and that is only half a serving. This product does not taste the best, but it's bareable. If you do buy this product make sure you use it in a timely manner. The powder in mine smelled bad after about 3weeks. It would have been consumed by then, but I was out of town for 2 weeks. I wont be buying this again."
2,Filler? Tastes terrible!,"Chocolate flavor tastes TERRIBLE!, I've ordered many products from Optimum Nutrition many flavors and this is the first product that tastes so bad I had to write a review, all others products I've tried taste great!, not sure if it was just the serious mass product or this is why the price of this product is so very low, in any case I would skip this product and order ON's Gainer product or whey protein product all available here on amazon."
3,Mohlis,"Not your normal protein shake. This will add weight quickly, just make sure you are lifting like crazy when you take it."
3,discusting but does the job,"I knew it was going to taste awful when as soon as i smelt it. However the price is very good compared to other weight gainers and it does the job. If you can deal with the taste go for it, otherwise i would get true mass from bsn"
2,"Made me sick. Tastes fine, Huge Scoop... Just made me sick to the stomach.","I was wondering why there was only 16 servings in this 12lb bag... now i know. I have a 28oz blender bottle, only 1 scoop can fit in it and allow you to add water... so you'll have to take a full serving in two bottles. The Chocolate is good, but about 30 mins after I took this, I got sick in the gut. Then around 5 hours later needed to throw up. It's a little much for me to say the least, but looks like it works for others."
2,HUGE SERVINGS!,"when i read the reviews an people said huge servings, i thought they were exaggerating! well they werent. The scoop is bigger than 3 regular whey protein scoops easily and ur supposed to put two scoops in ur drink. Its really hard to finish an entire serving. A 6lbs pound drum is only 8 servings!!! Thats almost a pound of powder per serving. come on, thats alittle obsessive. Other than that, it tastes alright. Its only gunna last me a week so i probably wont see any results.(im 120lbs - shouldnt be that hard to gain weight) Took 2 weeks to ship it to my house but it was free so i won't complain. This is definitly an expensive product to cycle. Dont even buy this unless you get a 12lbs bag. (Thats barley 2 weeks worth -- 60$) Optimum Nutrition still makes great stuff but weight gainer just isnt for me, ill stick to whey proein."
4,works,arrived in a timely fashion. effective for weight gain (muscle if you work at it) don't slack off even a little or you just gain weight
5,good product,"I had the 6 lb tub of this, It only lasted me a week and a half, yet still did the job. I gained 4 pounds in the first week. I was always stuck in the 150's but this help me get to 161.4 in just a week and a half. I do not see any noticeable gains yet but I think that's because I need to gain more like at least 15-20 lb. I am thinking about going to the 12 lb bagTASTE: the taste is good with milk (taste like nesquick if you buy chocolate) but its disgusting with water I do plan on trying bsn true mass just to see if its better, but i still recommend this product"
4,Serious Mass Choc,"When i opened the serious mass protein i noticed they include a scooper that barely fits into the actual container, i use 1 and 1/2 scoops before workout and 1/2 after mixed into blender bottle with milk. Taste is fine."
4,Good product. Dissolve hard !!,Good product but only thing I dont like about this Vanilla flavor requires more vigorous shaking than the strawberry flavor. I dont know ? Overall the product is good.
4,Good for the price I paid,Good supplement for hardgainers. having low protein and more sugar % mi8 be a disadvantage. Overall good product for the price I paid
3,too much dextrose per serving.,"if you are too skinny and want to bulk up, take this product....i went from 150-175 pounds on it. (put on some fat also)but if you have been already going to the gym for more than two years, bulk up using superior methods...the overuse of sugar isn't so good for you...your body does not need 200 grams of dextrose after working out for recovery. a half a scoop of this if you must with 1 serving of whey protein (24 grams) will do it.I stopped this after a while, my body didn't respond to this after my 5th bag....it just got me fatter really and just put a lot of water in my muscle.1 sweet potato or 1 banana, 2 scoops of whey, 1 table spoon of honey mixed all in the blender is my current shake."
4,15 Pounds,"I have a hard time keeping weight on, even with regular PT. Serious Mass has helped me gain and maintain 15lbs in less than a month. The extra callories are a huge help!"
5,excelente,es muy resistente el precio es económico fácil de usar de lavar y ayuda mucho porque no tiene que usar una batidora si no que en pocos segundos ya esta.
2,poor service,"I've had many weight gain products, and this is the only one that hurt my stomach immediately. After asking for a return I was bounced back and fourth between amazon and 24hr fitness with no luck. I've given up on that idea so it will sit in my closet until I find someone to give it to. P.s I only took half a serving, as they are HUGE!"
3,Does as advertised,"It's overall a pretty decent product. While I've been taking it for a week or so now I haven't seen serious results yet, but I've also been halfing the portion sizes. The average body just can't process 1,200 calories efficiently on a whim. Additionally, their portion sizes are also the only thing keeping this product down. I figured that weighing twelve pounds this bag would last me a good long time, but if you go by their servings you'll be out by your sixteenth usage. That for me makes this product far to expensive for consistant usage. It may work, but I can't afford to wait and see."
5,"Not quality Calories, but none the less, LOTS of qualities","With the size scoop this weight gainer comes with and the amount of calories per serving, I only use one scoop per serving which is half of the recommended serving. For someone who wants to put on mass quickly, I think this is the optimal amount as there is no way the human body will digest a serving of 1200+ calories. With that being said, the taste isn't bad at all, and for the price, it's the weight gainer to get if putting on weight is your primary motivation.I would also recommend to anyone with these types of goals to also supplement amino acids separately to help with digestion and absorption and if your hitting the gym hard, definitely adding a natural test and gh booster likeTribulus Terrestris 90% Bulk Powder 25 Grams + FREE Primaforce D-Aspartic Acid 100 Grams(which is what I take) or even some longjack root to elevate hormone levels in order to use those extra calories build more muscle is not a bad idea at all."
1,Don't waste money,"I bought this for my boyfriend as he was trying to gain more mass. I was excited to buy this for him.The serving size is 2 HEAPING scoops. I looked for the scoop and it was more like a bowl!! It's 8 oz. of powder per scoop. (I hope you have a big shaker)It was hard to dissolve, if not impossible. Chunky!! Very clumpy.Also a side effect is fatigue after 30 minutes or so. I thought it was just because of the high calorie consumption, but no, it's most likely because of the large quantity of maltodextrin (worse than sugar) in it.I would not suggest this product. Rather use an extra serving of something else."
2,Powder was all over the delivering box,"Hi! I ordered Optimum Nutrition Serious Mass, Vanilla, 12 Pound for the first time. Before i was ordering 6 pound only. How mad and dissappointed i was when i ve got that amazon box and the powder was already all over that box. I am not sure if it was UPS guys fall or the product packaging was bad... but now i will have to throw out nearly 3 pounds of that ""box"" powder. Very upset!("
5,Perfect,"Taking It Right Now, It Came In Just Like I Expected, Cant Wait To See The Results Of This Product!!!"
4,Great value,"This is great for the price that you pay for it, its 12lbs of weight gaining protein powder.Its made by a reliable company ""Optimum nutrition"" which also makes ""gold standard 100% whey"" that ive been taking for years and works great. The only downside and reason that i took off 1 star is because the scoops are HUGE and i mean really massive. The scoop that comes with it looks like the ones that come with laundry detergent, i would recommend only drinking 1 scoop 3 times a day with milk instead of taking the recommended ""2 heaping scoops""Besides that, its a great product that works. I would definitely recommend it to anyone trying to gain some mass"
5,Awesome,This product works.Flavor is great.The recommended serving size is way too big. I take 1 scoop everyday and 1 scoop after exercise and it's enough.As soon as I run out of it I'll order more.I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
2,"serious mass, serious bloating",Well. For me this product just isn't practical. After drinking it it leaves me feeling really bloated and sleepy. You have to use 2 huge scoops to get the max calories. And after addinng 24 oz of milk the shake it so thick that I have to use water to wash it down. I added 48 Ozs of milk to thin it a bit but this filled up the blender and was just way to much to drink. It does mix well in a blender and taste great. If you use a shaker cup you can only use 1 scoop with a lot of milk but you will still have chunks. I won't buy this again. I'm going with true mass next time.
5,Overall 5 Stars,"First of all the price is incredible. The free shipping option is very quick, I purchased mine last Thursday and they arrived on Tuesday, for free shipping that's quick.The vanilla flavor is good and it doesn't over flavor the other ingredients of my protein shake, let's say my Strawberry-Banana protein shake tastes like strawberries and bananas.Mixing the the powder is a bit tricky but I use my blender or my manual bottle-blender and it dissolves very well."
3,don't believe everything the description says,this product requires added creatine to be what it is described to be it has no creatine or only one gram
1,Get a huge blender...,"Good luck mixing this in your protein shake bottle, you will need a full sized blender to use this product correctly. One serving consists of two scoops, which... had I read the label before opening, I wouldn't have even opened it. Because - each scoop is 170+ grams.So with this 10 lb bag, you're going to get approximately 16 shakes total.Other than that, it tastes pretty damn good."
3,Too Many Calories,"There are + and - to this package. Bad thing is that it has over 1200 calories per each serving. If you are trying to achieve 6 pack, that will prevent you from it. Good thing is, this package has creatine and L-Glutamine"
5,New,JUST GOT THIS ITEM SHIPPED TO MY DOOR. I AM EXCITED ABOUT IT AND THE RESULTS I'LL BE GETTING. HEARD A LOT OF GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT.
4,Good product,"This is a good product if you're looking for a mass gainer if you're trying to get a combination of protein, carbs, and vitamins in your system. It's not a miracle worker but it's a solid product and I have no regrets buying it."
2,Not the best - to me,Pro - the shipping was fast.Con - I ordered the vanilla protein and I had squirts both times after I drank the shake. I stopped using the protein after the second time. I don't know if it was just my bag or if it is common. Also the smell and taste of the shake is pretty bad to me. It smells/tastes a little vomity. Has anyone else had this issue with the vanilla?
1,Serious Waste of money and time!,"I thought a 12lb bag would last me at least 1.5 months. Using 2 servings a day and the bag lasted 12 days because the scoop is gigantic, Very hard to mix. A month supply will cost $100. or a lil more."
4,works!,"Bought this for a friend and definitely noticed a difference in his body and build within a month. It might also have been due to his exercise regime, but he says this helped him a lot.Went from scrawny asian boy to decently buff asian boy"
4,Got a great deal!,"$44 dollars for a 12-lb bag of protein is one of the best deals you will find anywhere!!! Usually it's about $60 for a 5 lb jar. However; I do NOT like this as much as Optimum Nutrition's Pro Complex GAINER. It does not mix as well or taste as good. Also, do not be deceived by the nutrition facts; you cannot fit the serving size into a standard shaker. I actually put about 175 g in a shaker (only half the serving size) and it is almost too much because the mixture ""grows"" when you shake it up. So in truth you're only getting about 25 g of protein and 625 calories from a shake. I always add milk it makes it taste better and adds more calories and protein. The upside of this is that a bag lasts a long time, even if I have 2 shakes a day. Again, I much prefer the Pro Complex GAINER, and will always choose that when the prices are comparable."
4,Taste good,"I wonder why some people on here say it doesn't taste good. To me, it is just another concentrated chocolate whey protein with 25g of protein (half serving).A takes less than 60 secs to get it mixed well with water in the blender bottle. However, it is more difficult when I mix it with 2% milk.The scoop is too big (1 cup size) that I can hardly get it out of the 3(lb) container. Yay!!! I only use 1/2 of the recommended serving (1 included scoop) as the pre-workout energy since I have almonds, apple, banana, peanut butter sandwich during the day already. Drink about 1 to 1 1/2 hours before working out is good to me."
4,Decent supp,"Been taking this for 2 months now, has actually helped me gain some lean mass. I take it as my 3rd meal, and after my workout. It also helps maintain weight. Not a bad supplement at all. I recommend it."
3,Works for the price,I haven't seen too much improvement with this product and I Am almost done with the bag in about a month.My weight has stayed around the same. I do however notice an immediate improvement when having my full diet plus a shake. I have used the shake to stay where I am and it saves me from losing if I split up the shake and have one morning and night. Overall a good product for the money. Combined with a high calorie diet works very well and tastes very good when cold.
3,"Requires a lil' hard work to liquify the powder, but otherwise, it is okay","Big scoop, was surprised.So took 2/3 scoop per serving instead, but around 2-3 times a day.Sometimes with low fat/fat free milk.A lil' difficult to mix it with water,and if you don't blend/shake it long enough,the drink will be chalky.Am using a blender ball and shaking it manually.It just took longer than usual to mix it up.The trick to liquify it:First, fill bottle with water.Don't add the powder first, if not a certain amount will precipitate at the bottom.Next, put in powder on top of water.Then, shake, or blend it in a blender.Lastly, if you want to add milk, only add it after you mix it well with water.If not, it will not mix well, it might even stay in powder form no matter how long or hard you shake the bottle."
1,Very bad tasteing,I don't see how a weight gain product can taste so bad. It has a very unexplainable taste no real vanilla flavor at all more like chalk. It doesn't mix well.Id recommend something else unless you like bad tasting stuff.
5,awesome stuff!!,"First off, all the reviewers saying this stuff is fake are one excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet. Anyway, this product has done myself and many others WONDERS. This is a top ranking product among many body building forums for hard gainers such as myself. I think these people who review products like these are either fat, lazy, or eat McDonald's 5 times a day. This stuff is everything it is advertised to be."
4,"Fill your gut, build that muscle!","I like to drink a half-serving of this immediately following my workout, and one more the next morning. I'm a hard gainer, so this helps me increase lean muscle mass while bulking up. It also tastes great!"
2,Some common sense please.,"It's too early to review it for effectiveness and the product tastes great but it's the most irritating thing I've ever bought.When I first opened it my container (which was a plastic tub not a bag) I was excited to try it out but after diggingthrough the tub to find the scooper my mood changed. For some reason these geniuses included a scooperthat doesn't even fit in the top of the tub. There's no way to get the scoop in or out without turning the entire tubsideways and the powder falls out or going through some other idiotic adjusting. For the love of sanity Optimum Nutrition,include a smaller scoop and increase the amount of scoops on the directions. Use a little common sense because there'sno way this was going to work. The scoop has measurements on it which are useless seeing as there is absolutely noway to get the scoop in and out with more than a quarter of it full."
1,Vile!,"I have been using ON Whey for several years and have been completely satisfied. I also use ON Casein and aside from the fact that it doesn't mix well, I don't have any complaints. Serious Mass, on the other hand, is the most vile tasting supplement I have ever used. I can't quite place the taste but it tastes kind of a corn-chip-flavored liquid. BSN True Mass beats this hands down and after trying Serious Mass, I am running back to True Mass. Since Amazon won't take it back, I guess I just blew $40. It's so bad though that I would rather lose the money than take a another sip of this garbage."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT TERRIBLE COMPANY,I accidentally ordered this product without realizing it had whopping 20 GRAMS of sugar in it per serving. That is 100% my fault. Being a loyal Amazon customer I have never had any issues returning an unopened product on here until now though. This is a terrible product loaded with unnecessary sugars from a company selling it that has no integrity whatsoever. PROOF: They don't offer returns and make it hard it to contact them about any issues at all. I am especially angry so i will be making a press release and bad mouthing this POS company every turn I can until the day that I die. If you want to waste 50 dollars of mine then I it is my social responsibility to confront this pitiful organization for the cowards that they are.
1,Low Protein High Carbs,First the serving size is 368 g with only 50 g of protein. 1250 Calories. Save your money and buy some protein bars. This product is for those who want to get fat.
1,Not recommended at ALL,"Problems: the serving size for this product is MASSIVE. I mean 1 scoop fills up my shaker by more than half. Its like shoveling cement into your mouth. I dont know how your supposed to take 2 scoops per serving. This product is misleading in its nutritional value2) taste 2/10 For something loaded with carbs and fat, it is the worst tasting gainer ive tried.3) Its cheap, but dont let that lead you to buy it. this is an inferior product.4) Shipping sucks, the crap company they use to ship got this product lost and i had to wait another 3 days to get the package.DISAPPOINTED"
2,SLOOOW Shipping,"Product itself may be good. I really don't know since I bought it for my son. All that I know is that the shipping took FOREVER. Not even close to what was indicated when I made the purchase. If you got time to spare maybe this would be OK, but if you want your delivery within 3 weeks, buy elsewhere."
5,"Great Price, Taste & Value","This is a great protein supplement for those looking to put on some weight. The amount of calories per gram of protein is ideal for putting on weight and has an abundant amount of nutrients as well. There is also a sufficient amount of creatine to support a low-intensity workout (1g), although I would suggest adding some creatine to this shake as a post-workout drink. I'd suggest Optimum Nutrition's creatine as it has the best price over any other (I'll provide a link below).This shake in fact can be used as a meal replacement depending on how large of a serving you use. Overall, this gainer has a ridiculous value over all others, BSN's True Mass, which I tried before, is more than twice the price of this powder at the same protein/calorie content.Optimum Nutrition Creatine Powder, 600g"
4,Tastes good..,I think it tastes good and wasn't to hard to mix with a mixing cup. I have had it less than a month and have gained a few pounds of lean muscle. I'll be getting it again.
4,Great product!,"This is a great product, from a fantastic supplier.The product tastes great - I tend to do only 1 scoop with roughly 20 ounces of water and 1 scoop of protein powder.I've used this supplier before, and will continue to do business with them after.After a week of using this, I've already seen some gains and improvements.Thank you for the quick shipment, I look forward to doing more business with you in the near future!"
3,its okay..,"I suppose this is good for a beginner, but there's barely any string so you don't really get to make all the bracelets with the colors you want. I'd buy extra string."
1,very disappointed,The book I received did not have what was advertised and pictured. The materials for creating the bracelets was cut off!
3,It was...,hard to do... at my friend's sleepover we tried to make them but it was hard... :( should have some easier begginner braclets.. but Klutz does rawk!
5,Great Book,My 8 year old has been asking for this book for some time and I finally broke down and ordered it for him. My son has been a huge fan of making friendship bracelets for a long time and when he opened this book he found that making these NEW bracelets to be easy and loves this book !!
4,Nice Product,"This was a gift for a child age 8. The book is nice and does a good job of explaining how to make various bracelets. There seems to be a decent amount of thread to make a good number of bracelets. I would add, as others have commented, younger kids might get a little frustrated making anything but the most basic bracelet. The slightly more complicated patterns take some attention and time to complete and I think a younger child would get bored quickly."
4,"Great for starting out, but you need more string!","I got this book as a present, and it was great! It showed me lots of new patterns and the book gave lots of colors. However, you do need to get more embroidery thread if you want to make more bracelets. Each cardboard spool only holds enough to make about 2 bracelets."
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!,I got this for my 9th birthday and I use it a lot! The only bad thing is it comes with not that much thread- I had to buy more. Step-by-step rules... Fantastic book.
4,Best for age 10+,"I bought this for my crafty 8 year old. She was very interested in making friendship bracelets and excited to get started. The instructions are clear but even the easiest bracelet is time-consuming and requires a lot of dexterity and sustained focus. She managed to make a few of the easiest bracelets in the book, but she couldn't take advantage of the instructions for the harder bracelets. I think a more accurate age range for this product would be 10+.She found on youtube a description of how to make a friendship bracelet wheel [...] This approach to friendship bracelets was much easier and more fun for her, and I think is better suited to the 6-9 year old crafty crowd."
4,Klutz craft,"KLUTZ is the place to start for creativity for the beginner. Easy with step-by-step instructions. Bracelets can be created in team colors, flowers, hearts and other designs. Fun to make with a great product to wear or share at end learning process. Book to be returned to over and over for new designs and colors."
5,Just the instruction I was hoping for.,My 14 year-old daughter knew a little about making these but wanted to learn some more complicated patterns and ideas she could use to create her own. This book fit the bill!
4,Great little kit for the kids,Purchased for my 12 year old niece as an X-mas gift.The quality is good and and the packaging is well made.I think she will like it.
4,Got a different item?,"Ordered what I thought was the item pictured; however, it was the fancy friendship bracelets version. The little girl I'm buying it for won't care, but it was strange how they sent me the wrong thing. However, I love Klutz books! Nothing was more helpful when I was a kid!"
3,Can't make up its mind,"Althought the premise is good, the cast fabulous (chuck full of cameo performances), and the production values above average, this film doesn't know whether it wants to be a Rom-Com, straight comedy, or mystery. So it's all three. The staging of the various ""Darwin Awards"" is usually VERY funny, and Fiennes does a great job as the lead (he's genuinely funny doing both slapstick and some more 'high-brow' stuff);but Ryder's 'tough-girl' is just too cliched, and you never really get to feel that she is capable of becoming involved with Fiennes. If you are looking for a little mindless fun(and I do mean mindless, as in people doing some really absurd stunts)then you will like this film."
2,The Darwin Awards,Did not like this movie because the storyline was absolutely weird. Like Joseph Fiennes but not in this movie. He's better in romantic roles.
2,fairly entertaining,"while the story line seems promising, actually watching the movie is a little painful - entertaining in parts, but as a whole, it does not make a movie. i am not sure how it won any awards. disappointing. and why so much crude language - to make up for the lack of quality content?"
2,Fine until Wynona shows up,"This film was somewhat amusing and then Wynona Ryder appeared. Her amazingly weak acting skills and sheer lack of charisma made me wince to the point of turning the film off ten minutes after she arrived, which is pretty rare. Normally I'll try to tough it out in hopes of a turnaround, but the pain was too severe.Given the subject matter, this could have been a lot funnier even before La Ryder showed up. Maybe a documentary on the Darwin winners would do the job. This sure doesn't."
3,"Move over Mythbusters, they are still fun stories","As a big fan of the Darwin Awards, it was fun to watch some of the older and more famous (infamous) stories come to life on the screen. It is an entertaining movie, although the love affair was a bit awkwardly done and I think wasn't even necessary to the story. It is something I would watch again and I am glad I added it to my library."
5,Service Industry Bible,"If you have any position of responsibility in any Service industry, this volume could be of tremendous value to you, check it out!"
5,Love this product!,I've been battling adult acne for several years now and have tried almost every product out there. Derma E's Very Clear Spot Blemish Treatment is one of the best I've found. It's strong but doesn't leave my skin feeling extra dry or irritated.
3,Decent,Has a sticky feel. Can't tell if the blemishes were gone the next day. Have used other products with better results.
5,Awesome,This is a great product I've been using a couple of years now (my father-in-laws). Glad to finally own my own.
4,BB 80,"I love duet songs, especially if they are blues songs. You get a good mixture of different voices with BB King's. My personal favorite is the song he did with Roger Daltrey. A must have for BB King fans."
3,slightly better than average,"B.B.King is One of my all time favorite Guitar Players for his basic approach but timely rhythm.this set follows His past colabs which tend to have a few cool moments&then quite a bit of Filler.BB is still sounding&Playing Good,but there is a cliche vibe going down that seems likely to be Grammy Bound.this is the Kind of Projects that the Grammys dig,but in terms of a Great Artist like BB King's Catelog it's just a bit better than Passible to me."
4,BB King having fun at what he does best,"BB King and friends at 80 is a bluesfans dream. BB is with some of the best blues musicians in the business.BB King and ""Lucille"" do duets with Billy Gibbons, Eric Clapton, Bobby Bland,Mark Knopfler to name a few.It is fun to hear the ZZ Top guitarist perform with BB King, well worth the price of admission.Eric Clapton and BB are togther for ""The Thrill is gone"".What is fun about this is the exchange of guitar licks between Clapton and BB King.There are also several other big names appearing with BB King such as Sheryl Crow. Glenn Frey of the Eagles, Van Morrision and Elton John with his Boogie Woogie piano.The CD is primarily blues songs that are done very well.BB King is 80 now but you would never guess it.File this under ""F"" for fun."
5,80 going on 25,"This will win a Grammy, as sure as I'm sitting here...and I am sitting here....you won't skip a track....every guest delivers the goods and B.B....well Mr King here's to 80 more...and thanks for bringing joy to the world."
4,"Happy Birthday, BB King!","BB King still sounds wonderful after 50 years of performing. This happy birthday tribute doesn't disappoint. King teams up with musicians from pop, rock, folk, and jazz to re-create his greats with interesting results. Probably my favorite is his teamup with Slowhand Eric Clapton on ""Thrill is Gone."" However, Gloria Estefan's clear, sweet voice adds a different and unexpected note to ""There's Got to be a Better World Out there."" Perhaps it's not King's best, but it's definitely an exceptional addition to any blues collection.Happy Birthday, BB, and may you rock on for many more years!"
5,Amazing At Eighty!,"You would never believe that B.B. King was 80 if all you had to go on was this CD. There are some really great pairings. He does a great version of ""The Thrill Is Gone"" with Eric Clapton. Billy Gibbons blends well with King on ""Tired Of Your Jive"". Sheryl Crow, Gloria Estefan, and Van Morrison also do a good job with King. However, the tracks with Roger Daltry and Glenn Frey keep this from being a five star CD. The tracks with these guys show a complete lack of chemistry. At the end of the day, though, this is a very enjoyable CD. I recommend it to anyone who likes B.B. King."
3,Don't judge an artist by his studio celeb album,"Granted BB King is 80, he continues to play the blues like no other. This album though, I think, does not show that whatsoever. If you're a 30-40 something house wife who digs the ""blues"" this is for you. But if you are a blues purist, this album lacks detail and motion. Celebrity guests doesn't sell this album to me at all. They should have done this live to really get an effect. I saw BB King in January of 05, and he was amazing. See him live, get Live at the Regal, then you'll know the real King."
3,Not Foresters best,I am generally a fan of Forester but this is not his best. Has some of the sailing details of the Hornblower series but gets distracted with a rather odd characterization of duty on both the American and British sides. There is a romance side to the story as well that feeds into this sense of duty that truly leaves you scratching your head.
1,Not worth Forester fans time or money,"I was so excited to have a C.S. Forester work available that I had not read repeatedly when I purchased this book. After forcing myself to slog through this book, I question 1. Why did I subject myself to one of the more poorly written books I have experienced in a long, long time and 2. Did C.S. Forester really, truly write this pitiful piece?This book reminds me of those contests of writing really bad Hemingway imitations, but in this case it is writing really, really bad Forester imitations. I have been a huge fan of the Hornblower series since I was old enough to read and that has been a very long time. Rereading one of the Hornblower books is like visiting a very treasured friend again. This book is such a disappointment and waste of my time and money. Mr. Forester should hang his head in shame."
2,"Pretty, but not my cup of wine.","Despite the fact that I share the same surname as vocalist Summer Bowman, I just wasn't as impressed by this album as I'd hoped for. I suppose I was expecting something else from it (having never heard their music before, I guess that was a poor assumption). I thought it'd be more electronic, not industrial per se, but darkwave or something akin to Switchblade Symphony or The Razor Skyline. If I'm going to listen to ethereal, I'd rather listen to Cocteau Twins or Chako; if I'm going to listen to neo-classical, I'd rather listen to Dead Can Dance or Qntal."
1,ROAD TO MOROCCO,"Amazon now lists tracks with this album, so you know what you are getting. There are some songs from Road to Morocco, but most are from different sources. The reigning theme song from the movie ""HO HUM"" is not on the CD. Neither is another personal favorite ""Moonlight Becomes You"". When I purchased the CD, tracks were not listed and I am understandably dissappointed."
5,Emily Dickinson's Best Poems,"If you are looking for a book to read on a rainy day and you're all alone, Final Harvest is the book for you. This collection of Emily Dickinson contains her best poems. Each is deceptively short. When you read a poem for the first time aloud, you will think you have gotten her rhythm down perfectly, and then BAM; you reach the end of a line to find a slanted rhyme, an almost rhyme, a word choice that will blow you away. Her poems reflect how she sees the natural world, life, love, loss of love, death in all its manifestations. I still have my original copy of Final Harvest that I used in college nearly fifty years ago. It is one of my most prized possessions. She will open up a brand new world for you: inside the mind of a language genius, a keen observer, a tiger in a tiny frame."
2,Not Essential,"This book offers a framework to organize your priorities for your child's education. This is helpful not only when starting the process, but throughout the process. It also helps organize information gathering. However, there are many better and more thorough FREE sources online. For starters the Department of Education has most of this information, as do numerous private school reviewers.In hindsight, the several of the 5-star reviews are written in very similar language. Real consumers do not repeat the title or authors' names in the review. Additional clues, this is the only book they have reviewed and the review dates are very close together. One Amazon reviewer is also an ""Admissions Director"" whose review is quoted in the inside cover of this book. Gotcha!"
3,"ok, not great","couple of good tips, but overall not worth the money got just as good info off the internet."
5,Exact Replacement for Dead Mouse,"The need for this product arose because the spring under the left button on the mouse I bought w/ my Dell Computer in June of 2008 finally wore out. I found myself pleased with the lifespan and really hoped to find an exact replacement for several reasons: 1) I did not want to have to get used to the shape and feel of a different mouse; 2) I really did not want to change out the wireless keyboard that came w/ the original mouse, too; and 3) I got four years out of a mouse and would very much like to get another 4 years out of the next one, too!Getting down to the details of this order, though, the package arrived as expected and on-time. The mouse worked perfectly w/ my existing wireless transmitter and feels exactly like my old one.Overall everything worked out perfectly and for $20 I got everything I wanted out of this transaction."
3,Decent mouse for the price,"Not bad. Not the most ergonomic, however not terrible either. Can be a little jumpy/inaccurate on some surfaces. Pretty lightweight."
2,LOGITECH LX5,"Nowhere in the description of this mouse does it show or describe a clumsy added attachment that plugs into the USB port and requires more counterspace and worse yet, in my experience has to be situated in very close proximity to the mouse. Oh well, you get what you pay for I guess. It was a good deal.. I knew it was too good to be true. Most optical mice have a USB attachment about as long as ones index finger. This has an 18 inch cord (just a guess-timate) with an added attachment thats just as big as the actual mouse... too clumsy! The mouse works ok."
5,No Complaints,This is now the fourth one I have purchased for 4 different computers. There have been no complaints at all from any of the users.
3,"not bad, but still some bug","Sometimes the scroll wheel still work after I release it. Once I switch to a window which has scroll bar, the bar automatically moves to the end due to the mouse. I don't know how to fix it."
2,"Disappointing, returning mine","I own (and love) my Logitech Cordless Optical Mouse for Notebooks, so when it came time to replace my desktop mouse I thought I'd try Logitech again. Not a good choice.Install was painless, although it does take an awful long time. Howver, my problem is that the mouse is ""skittish"" (all over the desktop, hard to control) and the buttons are unresponsive (somtimes they work, sometimes they don't). Tried moving the receiver closer to where I use the mouse, didn't help. Maybe you'll have better luck, who knows. But mine's going back to the store."
1,wireless mouse,I was very disappointed that I never recieved this purchase! Ordered it standard shipping.ELECTRONICA DIRECT and USPS confirmed my delivery date.I ordered A keyboard from amazon at the same time and recieved it 5 days later but never recieved my mouse.I can't really put the blame on electronica or USPS but because I didn't recieve my purchase from electronica I most likely WILL NOT be ordering from them again!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Seriously not worth $30,"If you are considering buying this mouse, please let me advise you. This mouse is actually part of a keyboard/mouse combo that together costs about $50. I was able to get a great sale on it, but that is the normal selling price. Simply put, the mouse alone presented here is more than half the price of the FULL COMBO. In other words, this mouse is NOT worth the price it is being sold for.As far as comfort goes, it is a little lacking. The way that it is designed, it is tricky to hold for a long period of time. It is not awful, but it is annoying. The buttons for the mouse are very long, which means that there may be some problems with holding it for a long period of time.It is a decent mouse, but not fabulous enough to pay the high price."
2,"Freezes Often, Requiring Reboot","I have had a lot of problems with this mouse. It will work for a few days, and then will suddenly stop working. Hitting the ""connect"" and ""reset"" buttons on the mouse won't fix the problem - all you can do is reboot. Otherwise it seems to work OK - range is about six feet, and so far battery life looks OK. Still, I would definitely not recommend buying this mouse."
3,Beware of the Large USB Receiver,"This is a great little cordless mouse for the price, and the battery life does seem to last forever. However, for a laptop, the USB receiver is a hassle. Instead of a small dangle that you can plug into a USB port and forget about, it has a long cord with a huge receiver that you must find room for. If you want to move your laptop, it's one more thing you have to gather up and carry with you. For $10 or $15 more, it's worth the price to get a mouse with the small dangle. However, if you are looking for the cheapest cordless mouse out there and you don't care about the large receiver, the mouse works well and will not disappoint."
4,good and energy saver,the product is good it requires 2 AAA Bat. and is really quick just conect and in 3 sec you have it working really good thing when you are busy on works
2,Needs a mousepad,"Upon using it, it mouse is....jumpy; it stutters enough to be incredibly frustrating. When you use a mousepad, it works great. I just can't stand mousepads, though. I'll give it a bit more time, but I think I'll be returning this one."
4,Nice Rodent,"I can't remember this mouse real well. I have about 4 logitech mice. I like the ones that the sender is plugged into the USB outlet. This one may have a cord on it and so I don't use it as much as the others, no problem in the way it works, just don't like the cord on the laptop, more to deal with. REX"
1,Cheating,"Not as advertised. Picture shows antenna just like a USB flash memory, but actually it is a 2""x2"" triangular paper weight. Not responsive when mouse is 2 feet away. Not a good buy at all. Sucks..."
1,Sluggish mouse,"I liked how the antenna of the mouse reached from my computer on the floor up to the desk, but it turned out that the mouse was very sluggish anyway. I'd click the mouse button and the cursor on the screen would pause before responding. I tried moving the antenna really close to the mouse, and reconnecting it, but nothing helped the sluggishness, so I returned the product. Not recommended."
2,NOT cordless!,"Works great for a desktop's mouse and at a great price, but... although some reviews here say the pictures have been corrected, this is not exactly a cordless mouse. The RF receiver is almost as big as the mouse itself and is connected to your USB by a long CORD, making it practically useless for a notebook computer."
3,"Great, BUT...","I use these bird feeder stands to hang my hanging baskets for flowers. These stands are so stable and strong, they don't bend when the flower basket is heavy with water. And they look great! BUT... assembling them is a problem. I bought 6 of them. Two were no problem to assemble. The other four were a nightmare. The metals come with pre-drilled holes for the nuts and bolts. Unfortunately, the holes don't align. We ended up using very thin bolts (several trips to Home Depot) that could squeeze by the poor alignment. So far seems to be working."
3,Attractive but seed container and assembly very poorly designed,"This is a very pretty product that deserves a prominent spot in the landscape. However, there are several design flaws in the seed container and it's assembly. We had to use a drill, metal file and washers to get the top and bottom of the seed container to seat properly and even after attaching the top finial, the feeder was still crooked. It will be cumbersome to keep refilling the feeder and I hope the threading will not be stripped with repeated use-there should be a better re-fill design also. Even though it seemed pretty obvious how to assemble the feeder, the instructions were not detailed enough and did not address/resolve the issues we had with assembly. There were some included parts that did not seem to be needed and/or did not fit properly (e.g., too big or small, insufficient threading length). The shipping packaging was lacking also as the round ball piece was completely exposed through the outside of the package."
2,Disappointing,"I was pretty disappointed with #2 in the Daisy Dalrymple series. The mystery doesn't start to unfold until about half way through the novel-- the rest is just set-up. When things finally do get rolling, I wasn't very engrossed by the mystery, and found the final resolution anticlimactic."
3,"5 stars for material, 0 for sound quality","It's great that someone is finally releasing the Smothers Brothers' classic Mercury albums. They've been out of print way too long.Unfortunately, the sound quality is hit or miss from one album to the next, and ""Think Ethnic"" is a definite miss, here and at iTunes. It sounds like a 3rd or 4th generation cassette tape dub, all but devoid of highs, and while that doesn't hurt the material (I doubt anything can) it gives the impression that those responsible thought the albums worthless right up to the point of pricing them. They also got the channels reversed, placing Tom on the right channel. Dick is deaf in his left ear, so Tom always played to Dick's right, which should put him in the left channel.What a shame. I hope someone gets a clue and re-masters these albums properly. The Smothers Brothers deserve much better than what we have here."
4,A triumph for silent movies in 1921,"I watched the whole movie. Yes, it is possible to enjoy a movie without dialogue. I really did enjoy the innocence of the movie, even though it were deamed evil with Arab Savages. However, there is a heart-felt feeling of passion and love by Valentino and is co-star Agnes Aryes. It is an especially interesting movie to watch now during our perilous times between America and the the Middle-East."
5,Only Valentino,"As a child I came across a book about Hollywood movie stars. There was a page showing a picture of Valentino as The Sheik, I was hooked, I was only 10 years old. Now I finally got the opportunity to see him in his most famous role of all, ""The Sheik"" and as a bonus ""The Son of The Sheik"". Both are silent movies but there is no need for dialog, when Valentino appears there is no one else there, only him. His magnetism is incredible, his presence absolute, no doubts about it, there is/was something about him I cannot explain, something unique, a force that drives you to imagine what it would be or was being in his arms, and those eyes only looking at you. I understand why women all over the world fell for him."
4,An Evening with Valentino...,"His name has become somewhat of a catchphrase today, and, with these films, it's not hard to see why. Not only are you offered both ""Sheik"" films (1920 and 1926), but you are treated to such ""extras"" as a newsreel covering Rudy as he judges a beauty contest in NYC, and a VERY exploitive short that simply has our star basking by the water's edge at the seashore--no plot--just Rudy in his (vintage) 20's bathing suit!Women back then loved him...men hated him--but, yet envied him. I was personally disappointed with the print of ""Son of the Sheik,"" however...I'd originally purchased the IMAGE version, which is stark, sharp, and crisp...this KINO version is dulled and seemingly washed-out. ""The Sheik"" is NOT the version that was shown a few years ago on AMC...as part of the Film Preservation project...the tinting is VERY strong, sometimes washing out the image. But, for those who want a double-feature + a nice array of ""extras,"" you'll be 95% satisfied with this disc."
1,Not for Novices,"The title ""Collector's Guide..."" led me to believe that there would be informational text about dating, printing techniques, and other descriptive information about post cards. The book is entirely illustrations of post cards in various categories and their prices...fine for long-time collectors, but useless for someone seeking historical information."
3,"Short on info, long on pictures, prices outmoded","This reference book for postcard collectors is entirely given over to images of the cards themselves, with no history, grading guide, or other information. That being said, it has thousands of photos of various kinds of postcards, well organized by subject (but I wish the reproduction were clearer). The prices are dated, and do not reflect the impact that Ebay, Amazon, and other online auction houses have had on postcard availability. All in all it's a nice pictorial reference, but not a must-have."
1,Collectors guide?,"Horrible prints, can hardly see details, blury pictures in black and white (a very few colored). Set up is okay, but again, pictures are horrible and crammed into the page. A waste of money!"
1,Useless,"Absolutely useless. Waste of money. Not worthy of its description. This is NOT A REFERENCE BOOK. This is a (poor) photographic journal of a collection, with speculative values based purely on opinion."
3,Not very comprehensive.,"For one thing, the index lists almost 200 artists, yet Schmucker is not on the list!(a few of his cards are shown, with no credit, under ""Winsch""). Not a bad overview of catagories and artist examples. Not much (if any) post WWI is shown. Only 16 pages are in color. Probably a good intro. for people looking for a catagory to collect."
1,Collectors Guide To Postcards/Jane Wood,Collectors Guide To Post Cards/ Jane Wood.The postcards in this book are hard to see as they are not in color and instead are in shades of gray. I'm very disappointed and would not have purchased this book if I had seen it in a store.
2,good minister,"Book is ok, a good start, but not a lot of meat, mostly a lot of water, beginner level faith, Ilike Robert, and will retain this book."
5,best read,"This author is one of the easiest reads . The content is very deep and well explained,as well as laid out to be followed with full understanding of the knowledge given."
3,Good value with minor problem,"Overall, I'm happy with these playmats. I ordered 5 sets for my babies play area. The only problem is that the ""little tikes"" logo on the blue tiles has been coming off since the day we opened the package. This leaves little glitter size white stuff all over my babies legs and hands. Seems harmless at this point, but annoying."
5,Excellent Family Movie,"I thought the cinematography of the the beautiful English countrysides were visually stunning. The cherub faced, talented young actor Courtland Mead was spellbinding to my children and my husband and I alike. The baby dragons relationship with the young Mead is heartwarming. This movie is touching, funny, heartwarming, and the latter part of the movie is filled with light suspense, adventure, and good action scenes."

3,Ultraman Great- maybe not as great,"If you are a Ultraman fan, You may find this a bit stupid. There are several factors which makes Ultraman Great a bit hard to swallow. 1. the story is a bit choppy. 2. some of the dialogue is hard to understand. and finally 3. It just doesn't seem to give Ultraman justice. However if you are a Total Ultraman fan, you just may find a diamond in this rough show."
2,Same mistakes as most Argentine movies,"Argentine movie makers seem to make it a point not to tell a story in their movies.Instead, an Argentine movie has to be plotless, be somewhat Costumbrista, slightly testimonial and, most of all, have a ""French ending"" to leave the viewer wondering.It has to be pretentious and boring, because Argentine viewers do not go to the cinema to enjoy themselves, they go to the cinema to be educated. Let's leave those minor things like create a good story to those stupid gringos, we are beyond that.Unfortunately, this movie follows all those guidelines.Which is a pity, because the acting is, in general, acceptable (except for Adriana Aizemberg, who manages to bring the movie to a stop by overacting in her only 30-second speech).But in all justice, no character is engaging, and there is only so much the actors can do.I enjoyed the voice-over by the protagonist (performed by Daniel Hendler), with his cultivated, yet young and typically River Plate accent."
3,Pretty good,They worked for about 5 hrs - not all sticks worked about 20-30 would not light up. Dollar store ones worked as well
4,Synchronized Swimming,"I ordered these for my classes Synchronized Swimming performance. They were wonderful, even though we had way to many for the first performance. We cracked them about an hour before the performance and they made it all the way through (this was for our last song).My only problem was that the connectors that were included had issues holding the sticks, not sure if it was the connector or our fault. Also some of the connectors ended up getting a slit in them making them useless.Over all wonderful product and made our performance so much better.(meant to put this on the green one as well) If frozen over night they can be used again but it should be within 24-48 hours, we pushed it a week and they did not reuse as well."
4,"Not a book to read, but a useful reference","This book introduces the languages of the world by continent in eight chapters. For every language genetic affiliation and the number of speakers is given. There is a striking imbalance in the treatment of the languages of the Americas, and those of other continents. In particular, the languages of Africa and Southeast Asia are only described very sketchily. At the end of each chapter (continent) an in-depth discussion of two selected languages is provided.Although the book is obviously designed as a textbook, it can only be recommended only as a reference, or as one among many textbooks for a specific course, because the style is too monotonous. It is also not a book to read through unless you are a language freak.Since the book came out in 1997, it is not up-to-date any more in every area. Still, the author's cautious and balanced approach makes it a reliable reference."
4,Tasty home jams,"Jimi Hendrix / Morning Symphony Ideas: Here are some interesting private Jams between Jimi, Buddy Miles and Billy Cox. This is not another one of those `look we found a live version of the same old song' CDs. This is a true collection of Jams, not concerts, which were never intended to be released. This is for the Fan, not the casual listener. As such, this rates four stars."
3,Characters Annoying,Passing is okay read for me. The tragic mulatto theme was annoying to me. I found both of the female characters were a little off. Even the woman who decided not to pass lived in a world of white imitation. She was distant from the regular folk and live her life based on a color caste.
2,"This novel just barely ""passed"".","I am an avid reader of all kinds of literature. I like the simplistic to the complex. ""Passing"" met none of those criteria. I considered it to be very superficial and there just wasn't much of a message or the journey of a life in this book. I read it, but it is not particularly anything that I would want to pass on. That's shame because I think the overall theme has promise, it just wasn't developed well."
4,Interesting subject matter,"I had to read this book for an American Women Writers class in college. It was a very interesting read. I enjoyed the subject matter and history. It was something with which I was not very familiar. A good movie that covers this same topic of ""passing"" is the Human Stain -- very good movie."
3,Missing Pieces,"The theme of 'passing' is one that has been explored throughout the years by few black authors, if any. Alex Haley is the only other writer I know of who touched the subject in 'Queen,' although his book did not entirely deal with the it.I enjoyed Larsen's treatment of it--her understanding of the familial and tribal loyalty conflicts that exist between black and white were impressive and well stated within the narrative containing Irene's self reflection and judgement of Clare.However, many aspects of the novel are melodramatic and undeveloped. I would think that with such delicate subject matter and so many interesting characters Larsen would have been able to flesh out the story more, perhaps by revealing more of Clare's motivations and personal thoughts. I also didn't particularly enjoy the criticism at the beginning of the book either--it seemed like an unrealistic attempt of filling in the blanks and gaps that Larsen should have been responsible for."
4,"Great Book, Strange Edition","Cheaper than other editions of the book but the text is sometimes not centered, crooked, or sketchy. I got it for a college English class and it worked fine."
5,Great!,"A short book but soooo amazing! It's a fascinating tale of culture, race, life choices, the meaning of happiness etc. It's an easy read and definitely makes you think!"
5,YEAH BABEY YEAH!,"This is what a mix is all about. You go for a ride through Acid Jazz, Dub, Trip Hop, Ragga, Lounge and many other styles. Once you've experienced the whole electronic scene of Rave and Techno and had enough of it, this is where ya end up. This still is true to the underground just with such a beautiful chill factor to it. Now I'm off to buy their other music. Perhaps I'll go to D.C someday and chill on a couch at their 18 St. Lounge Club, sounds groovy!"
3,Not quite what I expected from this downtempo duo,"With more of a Carribean, bossanova feel than a london beat feel, this disc was slightly dissapointing for me. It is all a matter of preference, this is by no means a bad mix, but it is not the type of downtempo that I am most fond of. I was expecting something more along the lines of the OM lounge series."
5,63 Minutes Of Global Lounge Exploration-VERY FUN!,"Knowing that Thievery Corporation comes from Washington D.C. speaks volumes. Our nations capitol home to ""the rat race"" where everyone works for the government or knows someone who does. Looking less like groovy fashion conscious DJs and more like Pentagon workers who have unbuttoned their collars and rolled up their shirt sleeves for a night of lounge going and DJ kicks, Garza and Hilton perfectly reflect a rhythmic fusion of big city grooves. Thievery burns a hot late night groove filling it with Global Lounge, Jamaican Dub, Eastern Indian Ambience, Brazilian Bossa Nova and London Grooves. It's all perfectly cohesive with an inspiring yet diverse mix. Playful with Tropicando by Les Baxter infused with a spice like Jassanova's Fedime's Flight and rounded up with a sleepy dub by Dual Tone. This is pure sophistication groovy and seductive. Light candles and incense mmmm...enjoy. This cd is addictive spin after spin."
5,Top Notch Mixing by the Pros!,"This mix is simply the most complete, seamless musical journey I have ever heard on a compliation CD. The way to listen to this CD is on a long drive when you won't be interrupted. Turn it up nice an loud and play it from beginning to end! Beginning from a subtle lounge sound that is reminiscent of tropical islands, it moves on to grooves with eastern flavor provided by sitar riffs, and then into some subtle reggae flava. By the time you are half way into this mix, you realize that it is shifting gears and the tempo becoming more feverish, finally arriving to driving house rythmns that highlight drumbeats. It is an amazing journey. Thievery Corporation are head and shoulders above the hordes of DJ's doing compilation CD's. They are true creative musicians who really know music and how to blend it together to make one solid mix from beginning to end. It really shows on this DJ Kicks CD."
3,Pleasant but uninspired,"I suspect most reviewers confuse the fantasy lifestyle the disk represents with the actual music. It is unfocused, uninspired, no vision, just well executed series of gimmicks that have no coherence. These guys are no Adrian Sherwood."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Alright, who's the wiseguy that replaced my ""Sound of the Sea"" CD with this? I didn't notice for 6 months."
3,"Good, but there's better","These guys deserve their props, cuz they got the chops. But if you can't get every CD in this genre, then go with Kruder & Dorfmeister instead (particularly DJ Kicks and K&D Sessions). TC is good, but K&D kick ass. This round to the Germans."
1,Warning: This is not the same No Man where Steven Wilson appears,"Amazon pages have confused two No Man -bands together. This is not the same No Man where Steven Wilson plays. All those who like music by Porcupine Tree etc. would be very dissapointed with this one. Although not totally bad, this No Man plays music which I would categorize as punk-rock."
1,"This is Teflon, folks!","I contacted Regency Wraps before I bought these, and this is NOT silicone, nor is it parchment. It is Teflon. So if you're using liners to avoid toxic non-stick surfaces, this isn't the product for you!"
2,maybe the product has changed,"I see many rave reviews, but my experience doesn't match! I baked oatmeal cookies which have lots of butter and sugar, and while the cookies didn't stick to this sheet as badly as they do to my steel tray, they had to be cooled slightly to avoid tearing them apart when sliding off the sheet. My main concern, however, is that the butter soaked through and permanently stained the sheet. Can't wash it out, so I wonder how sanitary this will be in the long term. I also bought theFox Run Silicone Baking Mat, 11-3/4 by 16-Inch, and it is impervious to oil, more non-stick, and stays in place on the baking tray."
5,Most awesome item ever!,I love love this product! Its a fraction of the cost of a silpat and just as good. Nothing sticks to it that I have experienced and the clean up is a cinch. Just a little warm water and a paper towel to rub and crumbs or residue and you are done. And I was sceptical about it not leaving behind any odors from one batch of cookies to another but it truly doesn't. I actually need to pick up a few more of these just to keep handy around the house.
1,Waste of money,"This is the most disappointing item I have ever purchsed from Amazon. Previously I have used parchment cut sheets and they are by FAR the most useable and convenient. After baking chicken using this product, I had a mess cleaning up and the sheet became very wrinkled. I threw it out and good riddance."
3,You get what you paid for,"Well, I can't say these are very good cues, they're light, the balance can be inconsistent between cues (I bought two, and one was weighted more heavily towards the rear), the tips aren't very adequate for applying spin, and pool shop owners laugh at you when you want the tips repaired.Despite that, though, I used them pretty much every other day on my dorm's rec room pool table for about 3 months. I didn't NEED a well balanced cue to be able to have fun with friends, and I wanted a cue that if it got destroyed (highly likely with college students) I could replace it easily. I'd say that these cues are fairly useful for beginner-intermediate players who don't rely on a lot of spin."
1,The worst pool cue I have ever shot with...,"I ordered two of these horrible cues for my father. They are not fun to play with AT ALL. They feel too light and flimsy, and it is nearly impossible to pull off a good shot with them. I guess you get what you pay for, because the best all around description for them is CHEAP. Do yourself a favor and buy quality cues. They make the game so much more enjoyable."
4,"Excellent but omits Nagel's ""The Structure of Science.""","This book is excellent as a first introduction to the philosophy of science. Two weaknesses are firstly, that it gives a less than precise explanation of empiricism and secondly, it omits discussion or even mention of Ernst Nagel's superior work ""The Structure of Science"" which is unforgiveable. Nagel's book is one of the half dozen or so superior analyses of the philosophy of science and positivism and should be essential reading for any intelligent reader in these fields."
4,"Good, solid overview","While not perfect, this is the best general intro to the Philosophy of Science I have read. Even though a few scattered parts of the book (especially the sections about the sociological aspects of science) are a bit murky, in general it's an accessible, clear, well-written overview."
5,Both deep and accessible,"The book covers the most important debates in philosophy of science with an amazing clarity and simplicity (it's a accessible to anyone) and still retain the deep arguments. The historical background and the multiple examples (including most of the canonic examples) are also of great interest... In my opinion, one of the best book I've read in philosophy of science."
3,Decent.,"This book does a nice job of covering all the different ideas related to and about the philosophy of science, but I became increasingly annoyed each time the author contributed his opinions or solutions. I would have enjoyed it a little more if that had been left out. Other than that it's a decent introduction."
1,Sad But True,"It makes me sad to have to say this, but what the other reviewers have said about this product is true. I am a small business owner with a tea lounge and wanted to try this out for possible use in my store. However, after brewing one pot of green tea I can say this pot is totally unusable simply because the brewing process never stops.It seems that part of the problem is with the designers' lack of tea knowledge. In their brochure for this product they describe green tea as a tea that can ""circulate freely within the teapot"" without a specified infusing time. This simply is not true. Anyone who knows even a little about green tea knows that it can become very bitter if left unattended in a tea pot.Simply put, while very aesthetically pleasing, this product is overpriced and does not work as advertised."
1,disappointing,"not user friendly & not as practical as desired & would like to return for credit, cover is very hard to get on & off. What is procedure for returning?Thank You"
3,Creative and somewhat useful,"This is not great literature or even average comedy. This book is designed by a rather-talented cartoonist named Vinnie who is proud of his mono-brow and wants to make life easier for his female friends. The entire spiral-bound journal has each month designed as a roller coaster, and there are stickers to put on the roller coaster for PMS, first day of period, heavy flow...etc. It is really a quite creative and useful little journal, and comparing the menstrual cycle to a roller coaster is quite accurate. Besides all this, it is a great way to keep track of your cycles for that next Gyno visit!"
1,Make sure these are the right units before ordering them,"When you order these, you actually get 2 per order. It doesn't seem too clear in the description, so if you only need two, order one unit as described here. Because, just like in the picture, you'll get 2.I bought it for my wonderful ergonomic keyboard and mice, to adapt to a wireless USB KVM. For some reason, they didn't work. What's more, even when I plugged these adaptors directly to the CPU USB ports, they still did not work. I'm not sure if it was my computer setting or whether they worked or not. When I'd plug my mouse and computer directly to the CPU PS/2 ports, they worked fine.They came nicely packaged, very professionally wrapped. So, make sure these are the right units because they may not work with every PS/2-USB set up."
1,Poor Quality Poor Design,"This stick is weird looking. That doesn't mean that it's practicality is great, it's not. It's short, unbalanced and a waste of money. The glossy finish on the end does not slide through your fingers well. If I were you, I'd choose another stick."
5,worth it,poor instructions..just pictures..it took my husband 2 hours to put it together....good quality.....worth the money.......my daughter is 3 and loves it
1,disaster,absolutely a horrible deal-got it with broken pieces and useless instruction manual-lost money in sending back the package-never deal with these guy again
4,Great dollhouse.,"My daughter (and son!) love this dollhouse. The thing I was not pleased with is that there are so many small parts and it isn't very sturdy once together. However, we fixed that with a bottle of wood glue. We glued all the dowels in and the doors and windows are glued on. Now, it is a very sturdy, beautiful dollhouse. So far, we have had nothing but compliments on it! It's really fun and cute!!"
4,Enjoying it but has issues,We are enjoying the dollhouse. It packs a lot of punch for the dollar but it does requires some additional work on the part of the builder. The instructions were useless and it does require wood glue to hold it together. My husband also had to shave down some parts to make them fit properly. Once you get beyond the frustration of putting it together it is a fun toy. My 2 and 4 year old girls love it.
1,Couldn't really finish it.,"I never did finish this. It just wasn't interesting to me. So by the time I found this on my ""to be reviewed"" section, I forgot I even owned. it."
2,Dated,"This book was written in the early 1920s and is so dated as to be almost useless today. There is also a heavy reliance on religious beliefs instead of unbiased facts about sex. In its day, it was probably a breakthrough and can make interesting reading if you are interested in finding out about early sexual thought and attitudes. But if you are looking for good modern sexual education with modern scientific facts, look for a more modern book and don't waste your time downloading this one."
4,"funny, no nonsense advice for singletons everywhere","I was given this book as a gift. Although it is for the singleton readership, which I am not a part of anymore, it gives the kind of advice that an old friend might give. Sure there's laughs, but the book makes sure to laugh with us and not at us. A good read."
2,Never bloomed,"So disappointed the lavender plants never bloomed. They grew about 5 inches tall and that's it. It was my first attempt growing lavender, so we'll see what happens this year. Shipping was good and the plants were well packaged."
3,"Some unique, focussed viewpoints","Interesting leadership book with some unique perspectives that I hadn't come across in other leadership books that I have read. Interesting writing style, as I read the book as it had been written that meant that I did not have a clue, how far I was to the finish line.I recommend this book for its unique writing style and the focussed unique viewpoints, for which the book has to be read."
5,"Not all gold, but certainly a few gorgeous pieces","Khachaturian is not very well known for his piano solo pieces, but rather for his orchestral music. However, some of the former are really great, and even if this CD contained only these - it would deserve 5 stars.Above all, I would mention here the Valse Caprice and the 2nd movement of the Sonatina. the sonatina as a whole is not hard to play, and this lyric movement is incredibly easy, but I personally see it as one of the greatest achievements of 20th century piano solo music.Murray McLachlan is a great pianist: great touch, very good technical capacity, and wonderful musical sensitivity. I will be glad to hear him in other composers, too."
5,great price,This T-stat was a great deal. then I saw that there was no gasket. It didnt bother me as to seeing how much i paid for the t-stat so i just went to my local autozone and got 1 for around $2.00
4,Good but not great.,"I was pleased to see Dr Joel Hayward's review of this book below. His own book ""STOPPED AT STALINGRAD: The Luftwaffe and Hitlers Defeat in the East"" (also available from Amazon.com) is, alongside John Erickson's book, easily the best book on Stalingrad. I strongly recommend these Stalingrad authors as best: Joel Hayward, Anthony Beevor, John Erickson, Graig. Your library is not complete without all these.But when we look at this book, by Stephen Walsh, we find a different type of book. It focuses too much on ground operations, ignoring the Red Air Force (VVS) and the Luftwaffe. And it is weak on explaining strategy. To counter these weaknesses are terrific black and white photos, many of them appearing in print for the first time.Walsh's narrative is average. You won't find it as thorough and authoritative as Hayward's or as compelling and racy as Beevor's, but it does the job.Overall, I still recommend this book and give it 4 stars."
2,Not Engaging,"I am not going to repeat observations made by earlier reviewers and which I felt were quite accurate (e.g. nice pictures, dry prose, errors etc..). I am an avid WW2 reader and I must say that this book failed to engage and get my interest. I found the lack of maps which follow the narrative disconcerting given the assumed scholarly background of the author. Few sources are cited, and when they are, it's in trivial statements like ""in the words of prof. X, from this point on, the Yth army group didn't have the resources to carry its mission"". Finally, I found the way the distances were indicated extremely irritating, e.g., the 6th army only advanced 274m (300 yards)???? Where did all these signifcant digits come from? You should know that ALL the distances mentioned in the book are cited this way. Decent editing should not have allowed this to be."
3,Great photos but spend your money elsewhere,"This is really a picture book with commentary, not the other way around. True, the photos arwe good. But if you want to lean something substantial about the wretchedness of Stalingrad and the failed strategies that caused it, and the brilliance of the tenacious Soviets, go elsewhere. Read Anthony Beevor, Joel Hayward, David Glantz, John Ericson. Or read General Chuikov's masterpiece, '''The Beginning Of The Road'''"
4,A GOOD GENERAL OVERVIEW,"For the non initiated, I would recommend this book about the battle that made the difference in the eastern front. It gives a good view of the final siege in Ostland, and is fact filled, the figures and orders of battle are there. I give it 4 stars because maybe there are too much numbers and figures, and this interferes with a linear reading of the history. Also, because there are some minor mistakes in the descriptions of some photographies, as a previous reviewer from Holland has pointed out. But if you have the time and the interest to live and suffer the battlefield in detail, then read Anthony Beevor's Stalingrad. But then, you only get the visual part through the emotions and images evoked in your mind by an accurate account of Dante's inferno on earth......"
5,A portable Bible encyclopedia,"It seems clear from the few negative reviews that these people haven't even bothered to read the book. Their antagonistic bias against Jehovah's Witnesses gives them away easily. How sad. Has writing a simple review become so difficult for some people?This book was designed to help facilitate discussions between Witnesses and members of other faiths as well as agnostics, atheists, etc., on various topics. I've used it several times as a reference work without difficulty."
1,Reasoning from the Scriptures,I purchased this book to see what they believed and how to refute what they believe.The book showed me they are very well versed in their doctrine.
1,the Bible is the only book you need,"it is sad that some people need a book like this... a Christian should rely on the Holy Spirit when witnessing, not on a book with prepared answers.Jesus said: ""Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer: for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist."" Luke 21:14, 15"
3,Not a book to retain for future guidance,"The book provides case studies reflecting various complexities in internation HR field, however most examples are not recent enough to guide students with newer ideas associated with HR. This book is definately not for keeps."
1,"Have to agree, it's a dog ; (","Hound Dog Products Planting Auger #HDP9-6I couldn't believe I wouldn't get some usefulness from my newly purchased Hound Dog auger, as the areas i wished to plant are recently tilled and planted (I am putting in end-of-summer replacement color), and found this auger stalled out before cutting through hair-fine roots near the surface. Arrrrgh. The wrenching of my wrist when the auger froze my 18v drill was worse then if I had dug the hole by hand. I tried different speeds, and practiced in different soils around the garden to no good effect. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM!!!!! I wish I'd read the previous review before my purchase, and can only OSH will reimburse me when they see the length of the register tape upon which this item was purchasedl"
2,Not Pleased,"I purchased this manual because I thought it would help me get started as a notary public. Instead the manual is full of statutes of each state. I'm not concerned about other states since I have the handbook for the state I'm commissioned. The handbook which is the same as that in the manual doesn't offer much information as far as practicing. I eventually found the information I was looking for from the website of another state's handbook. The same information is listed in the book. I believe all the information in this book can be found online and in the library. Unless, you want it to look good on your bookshelf, I don't think purchasing this manual is necessary."
1,Stay Away From this Manual,"Stay away from this book! You get more useful information out of a Notary Primer Guide published by the National Notary Association. The manual only contains about 50 pages of vaguely useful reference material. I purchased it thinking that it would make a good technical reference that I could consult when I had to prepare a tough protest or affidavit, but even the small amount of reference material contained in it is poorly written. The other 750 pages are copies of state notary statutes, many which are out-of-date since the manual was published in 2001.I don't see how any publisher could put a product like this out on the market - to charge $30 dollars for nothing more than copies of state statutes is highway robbery. If you need to consult Notary statutes in a certain State then use the internet to find an up-to-date copy. Buy a Notary Primer Guide for your State if you need a general reference book."
5,Very pleased with my purchase,"I am very happy I bought this book.I've read books that handled on serotonine and dopamine before, but this book is so extensive and varied...It explains very well what kind of effect certain substances have on your body and mind and also why we 'selfmedicate with alcohol, chocolat, coffee... and why in the long run those are no good for you.More importantly, it hands you alternatives that are healthy and nonaddictive.I'm going to recommend this book to everyone that I know!"
5,Quality and improvement of Life!,"All recovering addicts and lost peaple (also everyone out there), this is great book for a little improvement."
5,Another Days of Wonder hit!,"Days of Wonder is quickly becoming my favorite company. Their games are beautiful to look at, simple to play, and a whole lot of fun! Memoir 44 is no exception. This is a great two-player game, which can be hard to find. My wife (who likes games where you have to think) loves this game. I prefer games where I don't have to think TOO hard, and this game is just the right balance of strategy and luck for me.The game is educational as well. Each battle scenario printed in the rules book gives a historical background for the real-life WWII battle it is based on.As with all of Days of Wonder's games, this one is beautiful! The game is very nice to look at. The board is also fully customizable. There are plenty of expansions too which will increase the replay value. Try this game, you will love it!Also recommended: Pirate's Cove, Ticket to Ride (Marklin edition), Carcassonne, Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers, Agricola."
2,Too shallow to have any strategy,"I guess some people are right to call this a lite wargame. But to me, even as a rookie wargamer, I found it too lite. Basically it felt like i just moved units into obvious spots (cover areas) and throw a die. There seemed very little in the way of options and tactics or counters or flanking. While im sure the many many expansions might add more to options, i didnt go that far with it.While im not afraid of randomness, i found that how the game splits the board into 3 sectors and you had to play cards to move in each sector just meant that this mechanic just limited more of your options. Setup took a while, and even if you have 20 minis or 100 minis on the board the strategy or fun never got better.If you want a WW2 game where you can use strategy, i recommend go somewhere else. Even if your a noob to wargaming."
4,Great Game,This game is great because unlike other war games like Tobruk or Warhammer you can finish it in about 1 hour. I can actually get my wife and sister in law to play.
3,"Ok game, but to much luck.","I have been into strategy board games most of my life. Although I like the design of the game it's self (i.e. being able to set up different battles) personally I think that there is to much luck involved. Having you whole battle based on ""the luck of the draw"" and on top of that ""the luck of the roll"" combined with the way that the game rules are set up can make for very frustrating game play. If you are looking for a hardcore strategy game, this is not it, but if you don't mind having a large part of your games based on luck, then it might be right for you."
5,Great buy on many levels!,"I bought this game for my 10 year old grandson who is fascinated with WWII. At first we thought it was going to be too difficult to learn but after a couple of days of play the whole family loves it. It is fun, interesting for all ages and amazingly educational. It is a total hit!"
2,disappointed,"I bought this cover from Amazon in the spring of 2009.Several weeks ago, after 2 years of use, the material began to disintegrate, so forget about it ""lasting for years"" unless that means 2 years.Our barbecue is exposed to sunlight, but I was still hoping to get more use out of this cover. Not sure if I will buy another one or try to look for one made of sturdier material."
1,Lasted less than 8 months in the sunlight - fabric ripped easily,"Looks nice and feels nice when you first get it, but it is definitely not UV resistant. Based on past experience, I'd expect at least two years out of a non-Sunbrella fabric. The cover first tore after about four months outside, but I thought I might have pulled it against a sharp edge on the grill when I removed it. I couldn't find a sharp edge, but was careful with the cover after the first tear ""just in case"". Well, after another four months it was useless. Ripped if you looked at it wrong. Don't buy this product."
1,How to Be a Great Husband,"The author gives tips on how to have a happy and successful marriage. The tips are simple and consist of things men normally take for granted. These include such acts like making call before going home, spending time alone,going out together, encouraging wife to realize her dreams, complementing, et. cetra. It is an easy to read book, consisting about 200 pages with large type face. It however requires a lot of imagination for readers outside America, as the author seems to address situations only in America. In my view, this is not a book for a general reader, as the examples given are rather boring and may not apply in other parts of the world. The cover design is good, and the price is fair."
5,A French Masterpiece in English,"I've taught French for years and worked as a technical translator for computer hardware and software providers. I love poetry. I love the English language. I love the French language. For a student or poetry lover, this book is an invaluable guide with original and translation presented side by side. Serious students may quibble a bit over specific phrases in translation, but any English-speaking person can enjoy the art of Beaudelaire without the drudgery of leafing through translating dictionaries and grammars. Lazy students of French could use the book to cheat on assignments, but no one can escape the revelation of the artistry of the verses."
5,Believe it,"I realize that all of these other reviews hyping Mr. Russo's abilities as a lyricist get a little tedious after a while. But they're all true. In my mind, Legio Urbana has just a bit in common with Pink Floyd, in that the words are just as cool on paper as they are set to the tunes (assuming you speak portuguese, of course).The thing is though, this band was not driven by just one guy. The accompanying music itself is good good good, and it bears repeating that you don't need to speak the language to like it.PS: If this was an American album, track #5, ""Era um Lobosiem Juvenil"" would be a radio anthem."
5,A classic,I was so happy when Condorito came out in book format finally. The only drawback is that there aren't more of these types of books out. Condorito is a beloved character and I am happy this fact was recognized with the release of this book in english and spanish.
4,Saint be a Sinner tonight and tip the whiskey o and tears,"Gosh, I ordered Audible Sigh about a minute after hearing it. It was good that first listen. Man, it hit hard in the heart. I read a review of this christian album and what, Christian album?? Ohh no. I was not raised a religious fellow and not christian especially, but now I was tapping my toes to these songs. I was conflicted. We all need something spiritual. Bill Mallonee is a poet and darn good songwriter. I may not be religious but I know what I like. I always cry when I hear that last song. Play on man."
3,Visit Bill Mallonee's Web Site,"Buy Audible Sigh. It's a good album. I know the phrase ""good album"" tells you absolutely nothing. Because, naturally, your taste in music is different than mine. But if you like any VOL song from any of their other cds, then I'm sure you'll like Audible Sigh.Of course, the Vigilantes Of Love are no more. They bit the dust a few years ago. But that's even more reason to buy this cd. You just don't know how much longer it will be available.If you like your records live, seek out a Viglante cd called ""Resplendent."" It is a U.K. import that was recorded live, in 1999 at The Axiom, in Cheltenham. Nine of the eleven songs on it are also on Audible Sigh. The only song on it that is also on there other live cd, ""Live At The 40 Watt,"" is ""Could Be A Lot Worse."""
5,Turn up the VOL-ume...,"Bill Mallonee & Co. have delivered yet another masterpiece. Audible Sigh is a true sonic gem from a band that deserves more attention. How VOL maintains only a modicum level of commercial success is beyond me. If you like poetry wrapped in pedal steel then procure this CD. Alt-country so good it'll make your mama cry... --Roy (Atl., GA)"
1,"""Blessing in Disguise""","I found this to be a very sweet story and a great addition to the ""Red River of the North"" series. I would recommend this book to be read alone or as a part of the series without hesitation."
5,I loved it!!,"I absolutely loved this 6th book in the series. Yes, the author did jump back and forth from the ranch to Blessing etc but it did not make the story disjointed. In fact, it made the story more interesting by keeping up with what was going on in both places and making us look forward to what we knew was going to happen in the end. When you start this series, it's hard to put down.I can't wait to start the Return to Red River series."
3,I found the book to be rather disconnected and hard to read.,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book. I have read all of the books in the series, and this probably is the weakest one. I did not like the way that the story shifts from Blessing to the Ranch and back again. I would have liked more material about the romance between Augusta and Kane. Maybe this will happen in the next book in the series!"
5,Good Audio and Picture,It's the only one version of this movie in DVD. Good picture and audio quality. Jose Mojica is a good tenor.
3,"Ok, but info lacking","I was in the market for a dvd burner. I did research and decided this would be the right one. I have a HP system, so didn't think any compatibliity problems would arise. None have so far. The only gripe I have about it comes from my own ignorance. I had no idea that there are different types of DVD recordables. What's all this + and - stuff?! There is nothing on the box or any website I found about it ONLY being able to read DVD+R & DVD+RW's. So I now have roughly $30 worth of DVD-R & RW's I can't use.I like the writer, it does what I want and has a couple of perks, like being able to edit the scenes (I'm new to movie editing programs).Just beware if you're not buffed up on the absolute latest in recorable media."
1,WILL NOT WORK WITH ALL MEDIA,"I just hung up the phone with their support desk. The machine kept spitting out a brand new FujiFilm DVD-R and telling me no media has been detected. So I brought the DVD-R back, thinking it was faulty. I bought a Verbatim DVD-R and everything worked perfectly. The next DVD I tried to create with a TDK DVD-R and I had the same problem.HP Support has told me that they are having compatibility issues and they can only guarantee that HP and Sony DVD's will work with this machine.This is a waste of money for me since I have to now go out of my way to buy Verbatim, HP or Sony DVD-Rs. Avoid this product!!"
1,"Good hardware, really bad software!","Easy enough to install. Hardware solid. However, there are a lot of DVD writers out there that are equally as good. I bought this because the software and cables were included and I wanted to edit home movies. Arcsoft Showbiz is too buggy and the tech support is very bad. HP is not much better but at least you could talk to a real person. After one month of emails and phone conversations, I was able to determine the source of two separate problems. The first was related to a known driver problem on their end. The second, was due to a mechanical high pitched sound that developed with Showbiz DVD recording. Finally, someone directed me to the audio sampling settings. It seems so obvious now. They do not know this software and made me reinstall it several times. I would not recommend this product. Pinnacle is a better product for editing. Again, REALLY BAD TECH SUPPORT!!!!!"
1,should have read these reviews before purchasing,"Dead out of the box. Installed programs..had recognition problems as stated before by others...would not run on brand new Dell system With XP Pro and 1 Gig ram. Spent 2 hrs on phone to tech.. "" needed to research problem more"". Email got multiple suggestions to no avail. Finally concluded it was defective...new one to ship next day....15 days later it had not shipped. Solved my problem by returning it to place of purchase and exchanged for new one. New one works finally. Still trying to get them to cancel shipment. Quality of productions so far have not met my expectations."
1,Didn't work,My son bought me the HP DC3000 for Christmas and I hooked it up to a Dell 4500s which contained everything the system demanded including Windows XP and 256mg of ram. My system would not recognize the unit. I spent a day trying many of the fixes offered on the HP website and it still would not function. I called and was on the phone with a techie for almost two hours trying different fixes - nothing! I then connected it to my wife's PC which is newer than mine and it still would not recognize the HP drive. The unit was returned today.
1,Is not so good after all,"There are many factors about DVD recording as I learned from this device. First, at least 20GB of free memory should be saved on your hardrive, I ended up buying an external hardrive to fix this problem. Then it takes forever to record a two hour movie, and if for whatever reason your DVD+R/RW can't take it all in because it doesn't know who much space it has before hand, it stops at the last minute of the 6hr time to let you know that it doesn't have enough space, so please try again, from the start. Finally, when it is all fixed, it doesn't write smoothly, it records with flickers all through out. This device makes you want to use VHS tapes forever."
1,Product just doesn't work.,"I am very technical and paid very close attention to the instructions. I even went to a forum where the HP Product manager was giving advice and distributing patches. I made numerous changes to the WinXP operating system trying to speed things up. As others have reported, I made many coasters (bad DVD's). Yes, I tried several brands. I finally gave up and sent it back for a refund after a month and many, many hours of effort. I think the USB interface is the weak link. The unit had trouble reading marginal VHS tapes, it had timing problems where the voice would not match the actions and even got worse as you progressed through the movie.I got rid of the unit and bought an internal ATI video card, a plextor drive and Nero burning software. I had this running the first night. Sure wished I'd done this at first, but I was depending on the HP quality - which I didn't find this time."
1,HP DVD Movie Writer DC3000/4000,"IT:s like this I purchased the dc 4000 about a week ago this is my 3rd one. But anyway i;ve had nothing but problems, with it ive spent 3days talking to tech support for about 3hrs eac time. Right now hp is doing research on it. to figure out he problem. But it appears to be a software issue.It does every thing but the main thing , which is burn the dvd . Al;so its its only compatible with the software the comes with it. so if it ever gets that fixed it might be ok. But i was very dissappointed with it and i expected better from hp"
1,Use an analog to digital converter card.,"I gave dc3000 an extra star because it finally did work. The transfer button never did work. I had to find the ""wizard"" to set it up. Not much is said about the actual copying, that it takes a looooonnnng time, that you may need multiple disks for one movie, the vcr must be stopped at the end of a disc recording and then restarted for the next disc (after you have searched out the appropriate frame. Last but not least -- the audio was displaced 1/4 to 1/2 second. This made it appear like a foreign movie which had translation audio dubbed in.Also should have a firewire interface, needs its own dedicated VCR and - surprise - ties up your computer endlessly.The verical mounting accessory -- if you do not mind holding the disc in while the door closes, then it's OK.I have 1.5GB memory, 320GB storage, speed 2.6MHz"
1,Didn't work at all,My Dad picked up one of these units for my Mom so that she could take our movies downstairs and start converting them from degrading analog tape.The unit we got does not install properly in Windows XP. After plugging it in there is a missing mass storage device in the device manager. When you get around to installing the software it can't find the drive during setup. Also it appears to hang our BIOS while the unit is plugged in when the computer reboots. I have to unplug it just to get past a certain point in our BIOS. I've had no problems with other USB devices at all and the available BIOS updates for my motherboard (GA-7S748) do not address any USB issues which leads me to believe that the unit we have is defective.There is also close to 0 documentation included in the box. If you decide to buy it at all make sure you're buying it for someone who is competent and doesn't depend on manuals.
1,What a piece of ******,"I would have to say that this is the most overpriced and ineffective hardware, that I have wished that I had not spent my money on in my entire life. Not only was it very cheaply made but the software did not work properly. I thought that this was going to be a great product but I have found that for the same price you can buy a dvd recorder at Frye's that does the same job but does not have to be hooked up to your computer and screw up your computer when you attempt, Yes I said attempt, to uninstall. Do not make the same mistake that I made....stay away from this product like it was your ex-wife looking for more alimony. And now I have to deal with UPSing it back to Amazon. What a major pain!!"
3,"Good hardware, lousy software","ShowBiz 2 stinks. After many hours of frustration I was able to reach ArcSoft only to be informed that the User Manual is not yet available for ShowBiz 2!!! When will it be - we don't know, ""we have no idea"".The help screens are great for explaining the obvious but forget about any real help. There are no toll free numbers to be found; there are no tech support numbers of any kind to be found; not on the CD, not on their website and certainly not within the software itself.I was only able to get a phone number for ArcSoft indirectly. HP wasn't much help either but cured hanging of Showbiz 2 by providing a .dll file download. That only took about 2 hours.In short ShowBiz 2 is buggy and arrives without instructions. The unit itself works well otherwise although there is no ON/OFF switch."
1,Not ready for market,"I got this DC3000 for Christmas and now, two weeks later, still have not been able to get it to work on my late model, high-end computer. My computer will not recognize it. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the software numerous times with no success. The only suggestion from HP was to do extensive editing of my Windows Registry. Well, no thanks. It's too late to return it for a refund, so I'll dump it on eBay. I think HP rushed to get this unit to market for Christmas before they had the bugs worked out."
1,Worthless junk,"Over the past 30 years, I've bought countless electronic items, including at least half a dozen computers. This DVD recorder from HP was one of the worst items I've ever bought (Acer gets the grand prize, but that's another story). After countless conversations with HP's customer support and endless uninstalls and reinstalls of the software, I never did get the unit to work. Finally, I've given up."
3,copyright remover,How about connecting a copygard remover between the vcr and recorder.I do this between vcr machines all the time and it works well.It should work -
5,Definitely makes my filter stand out,"Second time ive purchased this item. i bought the black cover previously. Looks great, but pretty expensive for something made of such simple material. Happy regardless"
3,Tomita takes liberties with Holst,"This older electronic transcription of Holst celestial work comes across dated due to the technology used and the styles employed. There are long passages of material which appear to have no resemblance to the original. For someone who listened to the normal version and liked it, the electronic version seemed more like an adaptation. I much prefer the treatment Tomita gave Debussey and Mussorgsky."
1,"I bought it, I listened to it . . . and I returned it.","Let me say right off the bat that Holst's ""The Planets"" is (probably) my alltime favorite orchestral work, and among my most overplayed CDs. I have several recordings performed by different artists and ensembles (my personal favorite being the recording by Charles Dutoit and the Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal). If anyone knows of a concert/symphonic band or wind recording of it, let me know!Having said that, I thought Tomita's interpretation was a travesty.I felt that ""Mars"" was very emotionless and antiseptic. It did not come close to capturing any of the tension or emotion that Holst was trying to convey. Also, I felt Mr. Tomita destroyed Holst's intention of conveying each planets' astrological definitions by combining (previously separate) movements into single movements.I am always looking for different interpretations of ""The Planets,"" but I was so disappointed in this album that I returned it to the store and demanded a refund."
4,Tomita,"One of my favorite ""transcriptions"" of Planets. Listening to this in college introducted me to classical works that has led to life long love of good music. Tomita had the ability to help you ""visualize"" music, through sound. Wonder what ever happened to him...he seems to have disappeared after the early 80's?"
2,Not worth it,I installed the replacement and After 6 months the lamp Went out again.. Warrantee only covers 90 days. Not happy!!
4,great variety of puget sound area music from the early 90's,"For the past couple of decades, the Seattle music scene has had a great deal of diversity and creativity. Much of this was overshadowed by grunge's mass popularity. The songs on this album are a compilation of some of the big non-grunge artists from the area during tha time."
4,Boredom Turned into a Pleasurable Story!,"This is my first book by this author. It started out so strong, which was why I liked the characters so much. And believe me they had to be great for me to have stuck with this book, because, (and this is hard to explain), I loved the story-line and Tatiana and Matthew, yet I became so bored with the telling of it.Of course, it became very interesting again - more than half way through the book. So, if you can stand the idleness, you'll be well rewarded with the 2nd half of the book. I think you'll love Lord Matthew!!"
2,"Her Highness, My Wife","I have read most of Victoria Alexander's books and have enjoyed every one of them... until I got to this one. I have started it twice already and cannot seem to be able to get through it. It isn't exactly bad, but I just can't get into the story. I would definitely recommend other books by Victoria Alexander especially ""The Marriage Lesson""."
4,"Her Highness, My Wife","Nicely written historical romance, if you are looking for a light enjoyable read with touch of humor, this book is for you."
1,Bored to tears.,"I normally adore anything and everything Victoria Alexander. This book started out to be good but I felt it quickly left me feeling bored and dissatisfied. The Princess's character was very annoying. Although I love Weston I just couldn't get passed how slow the book moved along. I would not recommend this book to a first time reader of Victoria Alexander. She is a wonderful writer, this book I feel was just a lemon out of hundreds."
4,Love a princess...,"I admit that I love any plot with princes or princesses and the story of the fabled Avalonia drew me in from the first book of the series. I agree with the other reviews that the first half of the book dragged. Normally, I read through my lunch hour and have a hard time putting a book down and getting back to work. I didn't have a hard time doing that with this book until the second day. Once I was past the half-way mark, I was finally intrigued. I was worried that Ms. Alexander would disappoint me, but she did not. Read through this book and I promise the end will be worth it."
4,Alessandra in love,It's just like real realationships bettween young high school kids.Alessandra was in love with a guy named Wyn and they went out like boyfriend and girlfriend.At first I thought it was about a young girl that likes punk rock music and likes to dresses like a punk rocker and she likes a guy that likes classical music and dresses very nice. I thought that the well dressed guy wouldn't like the punk rock girl it turns out there going out. They have realife situations and they have to solve them. Alessandra's friend first found out she was suprised and couldn't belive it.I think it's a wounderful book but I think 7th graders and up should read it because it deals with adult stuff.
5,Good Job,"This is another one of HFL's(Health for Life)good books. They have many good books on bodybuilding and strength training for individual bodyparts. This book covers the wonderful plyometric exercises which increase the strength of the fast twitch muscle fibers which are invloved in fast explosive movements. You will run faster, jump higher and move harder than you ever thought. I'm not kidding either. These exercises really work. There are exercises for upper body and lower body. There are even special exercises for martial artists who want to greatly increase their punching and kicking power and speed. There is also a section on how to use plyometrics to use more muscle and help bodybuilders get bigget quicker by using more muscle. This book is one of the best on the subject of plyometrics."
1,Bootleg copy,"First of all, this game is so bad I couldn't play it for a minute. The Playstation version of this game is dirt when compared to it's PC counterpart. The Playstation version doesn't allow you to save in the middle of a mission, and also features horrible graphics and sound. Also, you can't play via the Net, unlike the PC version."
4,Unit Lost,This is an ausome game to start with and has ausome expansion packs.It gives players multiple choices and total control of your army and facilities.
4,ya,"im jus gon put a review... might not be to good but its entirely true... its a lil buyest:-p red alert 1 was is n alwayz will be my favorite game.... the only reason i didnt get it for the computer was bc i run on XP n it only runs on 95,98, and me but i also have PS2 so i was so genius n i got it for PS1 bc the graphics r worse but its still the same fun fun fun fun game!!!... presonally i think this is the best game westwood ever came out with... too bad they didnt make one with better graphics and playable on XP:-p (red alert 2 is not as good if u ask me but get it:) its still fun and it has better graphics... but i would prefer and red alert XP..)"
4,A straightforward account,"I can attest that this book is an efficient gateway to the understanding of the roots of Christianity. The period it covers starts from the very beginning of Christianity and ends around the Seventh Century. All the usual suspects are there: the early Church Fathers, the heretics (viz. Arius, Nestorius, Pelagius), key Roman Emperors and Empresses. Naturally much more topics are covered: e.g. the development of theology and politics. The continuity of its long history really renders Christianity remarkable: e.g. current liturgies have been in use since the third century! A fascinating read if you are interested in the topic."
4,"interesting, detailed anaylsis of the early church",This is a good book to build on one's knowledge of the early church if the reader already has a general knowledge of church history. Most of the book is easy-to-follow although I must admit he lost me on some of his explanations of the various doctrines held by some of the early church fathers.
3,Excellant coverage of early Christian history,"Mr. Chadwick has produced an excellant book that contains information all Christians should know well. I did find the text some what difficult to follow. Complex sentences, many subordinate clauses, a pelthora of names, these and similar traits, will probably disuade the casual reader. A great reference for Teachers, bible students, and those with a serious interest in Church history."
3,Early Church,"Once again, this book is heavily weighted toward the Catholic church and is less than objective. I was disappointed that there is not more information about the 1st and 2nd century Christian churches."
3,Material for teaching,The Early Church History gives good information for teaching in a Bible study class. It clears up many mysteries and spectulations about other characters involved in the early christian church that is not found in The King James versions used by many Bible Study Classes.
4,Concise and interesting,"This is a great introduction to the early church. While it provided an interesting history, the stories of the early church leaders and martyrs also were inspirational. Reading about these early heros renewed my faith in what the Catholic Church is really about. Jesus did matter and is just as relevant today."
4,"Somewhat outdated, but still an excellent introduction","Some of the scholarship here is a bit outdated (for instance, the contention that Eusebius of Caesara and St. Epiphanius of Salamis were proto-iconoclasts has been thoroughly dismantled in recent years) but this is still the standard and the classic text on early Christian history, covering roughly the period of the Apostolic Fathers (late first century) to the Seventh Ecumenical Council (eight century) and introducing all of the major themes of Church history along the way, including theology, liturgy, art, major figures, etc. The focus throughout is primarily on Western Christianity but the author is also familiar with Eastern practice and generally takes a balanced approached. If anyone is interested in learning more about Church history but has very little knowledge of it already, this book is an excellent place to start."
1,Amplifier is defective.,I have had this amplifier less than six months and the right rear channel is not working at all. After e-mailing Amazon and the store I bought it from(Discount Jungle) I was told to contact Blaupunkt directly. Blaupunkt informed me that neither Amazon or Discount Jungle are athorised dealers and any repairs that the amp needed would not be covered by any warrenty. I would never purchase anything like this from Amazon or Discount Jungle again.

2,disappointing!,"Graphics are terrible, it is more arcade style then simulator! They have stock car and Indy car modes, stock car is way easy to win all the races and be the stock car god, but switch over to the Indy car mode and you get the (...) beat out of you every race! The Andretti’s slam into you and just basically play dirty! Trust me don’t waste your time or money on this one!"
1,Worthless,"Can't use dual-shock controller, graphics are piddling, car dynamics are not even realistic. Try GT2 instead."
4,good but isn't the full system as stated,"Good product but it isn't the full system as stated you have te reuse your old strut tops and that's not a huge problem but I expected a full kit,"
3,never received exchanged item,"I received my order and wore it one time both clasps broke on the straps. I returned the item and never received the new one. I have been charged the amount of my purchase, but have no product to show for it.. I am quite disappointed in this experience."
1,Save Your Money,"Considering that Wicca has no history going back to the Paleolithic times I can find nothing to recommend about this book. For anyone who wishes to read a truly scholarly history of Wicca I would suggest 'Triumph of the Moon' by Ronald Hutton. Wicca is a modern religion created by Gerald Gardner in the 1940's, not some ancient belief system.As for Morgan Le Fay, she is a fictional character who doesn't even appear in the original legends about the equally fictional Arthur. So claiming that the spells come from her also rates as a piece of fiction.Save your money, there are far better books out there."
4,Overall Fairly Good,Haven't had them long enough to comment on longevity however I can say they don't squeal and there is no noticeable brake dust. Only negative to note the casting of the backing plate for the pads was a bit rough and needed to be filed down to fit more easily. The installed shim worked better than the factory part and the pads were considerably cheaper than stock.
4,Book report for school,My son Zack (10 years old) read this for a school assignment. He loves reading this book.
4,A funny alternate history time travel,"Janice Meredith Atwood has been groomed since birth to be a genius. Her mother, a failed time traveler, decides that Janice should travel to the medieval age to prevent the devastatingly deadly plague.Jan goes back in time with all sorts of surgical instruments and equipment from the future. She appears at the cottage of Ethelred, a barber/surgeon who was burned at the stake for washing his hands and instruments, just before he's killed. She convinces King Edward and everyone else that she's from the future and is there to help. Will she succeed without messing up the future and more importantly, does she care?Without a doubt, this is one of the funniest time travels I have ever read. The heroine changes history as we know it. It's enjoyable from a time travel or historical standpoint, but also as a comedic farce of a tried-and-true genre.Kathy Boswell, Romantic Times Book Club"
5,My favorite show *sigh*,"My son, when he was in college, got us hooked on Buffy. Buffy was so much more than a vampire show. It was about growing up. When Buffy ended we bought Angel season one. We continued to buy Angel until we had all 5 seasons. We couldn't watch season 5 on TV because the station we watched it on would preempt it with basketball.Angel takes us into young adulthood. There is drama and action but what hooked us on Angel (and Buffy) was the humor. The writers were so creative. All of the characters were multi-faceted but the Angel team all wanted to do ""the right thing"" at great personal cost sometimes.We actually delayed watching the last episode because we didn't want Angel to be over and done. But this is the type of show that one can watch over and over again. I guess we will have to buy all the Buffy episodes next."
2,America's Funniest Home Videos: Guide to Parenting,"The jacket implies that the program will add funny home videos along with guide to parenting. This is just clips of the old FHV show and not really good. I don't understand the title. The video does not have very much video on families or children. It is a mix of anything you would see on the show...dogs, people do all types of activities, and skits or staged performances. They stop short of putting advertisements in the show but they have them before the show. I would not recommend anyone buying this unless this is what they wanted."
3,The Whistle Pig -- an interactive endevour!,"Discover this cute little book! -- it packs a big challenge. I think the reader is suppossed to ""open his or her eyes to see the light"" and then they will be the enlightened. I think the PA ground hog ""Phill"" saw the lighht this year. Most intellects will like this one -- and the stories are also OK for the beach chair reader."
4,"Soft, Smokey, Goes Quickly","My dog enjoys these treats. They are soft and smoky. Smells really flavorful. I only give one to my dog at a time and not every day. The little soft bones can be given whole or broken up into little pieces for training. I don't feel like these are the most healthy treats so I limit how much I give and rotate with other wholesome, nutritious, low calorie snacks. I definitely don't give my dog one of these every day. That said, it's a good motivator/reward for my dog and I like to use it when I ask him to do something challenging. And a small bag will last me a while since I only use this occasionally."
2,Good when it works,"The unit I recieved wouldnt power on, reseated the battery several times and it eventually came up. When it worked it was handy for check temps around the house. Replaced battery but this didnt resolve the issue I have the same problem now and will be checking with the manufacurer to see if the unit has a warranty."
1,MISSING CLIPS,"I received this book directly from Amazon. It was used and described as ""good""; I purchased it and was VERY disappointed to find upon receipt that many, many clips had already been removed from this ""good"" used book.They say returns are EASY, but they are not. As an Amazon Prime member, I would expect them be believe me and send me a new used book, period. It is so much trouble to return this book, that I'm just going to write off the $3.75, keep it and make do.I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in Amazon Prime for essentially calling me a liar -- if they had believed me, they would have taken the steps I described above -- that's what virtually all other merchants I buy from online do.Ready-to-Use Old-Fashioned Illustrations of Books, Reading and Writing (Dover Clip Art Ready-to-Use)"
2,The Earth2100,"The earth movie 2100 script has some problems, which leaves a bit monotonous and confusing. The documentary should be more objective, clear and straight to the story was more interesting. Also missing subtitles in Spanish (the second most spoken language after English in the world) and I felt the lack of subtitles in Portuguese. Brazil today is a major consumer of the world. Only in 2011 were more than 7 billion U.S. dollars that Brazilian products consumed in the United States.Amazon also should create a sales channel for Brazilians."
5,Earth 2100,ABC news done again! We can feel it by now. I watch via DVR and it is beauiful show and the artist work is so cool!
1,This propoganda could have been more plausible,"Saw this nonsense on TV. It feels like the creators of this ""masterpiece"" made thing up as they went. No proof whatsoever for any of the assertions the authors packed this documentary with. Pure fantasy! They tied to tell the story partially thru the experience of one imaginary character. The story sounds so fake, you have to have no clue about anything to find it belivable.I would be ashamed to be a part of this documentary."
5,Earth 2100,"This is really good because it give a very real depiction of what could be a our future.. Seen in the eyes of a little girl from (June, 2009 - 2100)"
4,Stiff animation aside Green Lantern shines bright.,"Green Lantern contiues Bruce Timm's winning record when it comes to animated tv shows. The show is smartly written that both young and old, comic book fan or not can enjoy. The CG animation is a sore spot, but combined with the excellent staging, music and voice work you tend to forgive it and be swept away on the adventure."
4,Green Lantern,"Enjoy this show. Animation is good as is the storyline. I would highly recommend this to fans of the genre, you won't be disappointed"
4,Not for young kids but pretty good for us big kids,"While I am not a huge fan of the computer-generated animated (I have heard it called clunky and I agree - reminds me of claymation), the writing is pretty good. Hal Jordan is a jerk, but that is what he is in the comics. The only thing is, and this regards marketing of GL animated, there is death and a lot of violence. Not for kids 5 years old and younger, probably ok for a 7 or 8 year old. But some episodes have lots and lots of fighting and shooting and usually death is alluded to or mentioned if not shown outright (like in the pilot)."
1,Mama Panya. Seriously?!,"I have not read the book, however, as a Kenyan I cannot get over the fact that the Mothers name is Mama Panya, which, translated, means ""Mother of Rat"" (similar to how ""Mama Simon"" = Mother of Simon, ""Mama Mary"" = Mother of Mary, etc).As a sign of respect in Kenya, children often refer to adult women as ""Mama X"" where X is the name of one of her children (typically her eldest child). As such, the name Mama Panya suggests that this poor lady has a child named ""Panya"", a rat, which Kenyans consider one of the lowest/ nastiest animals. This makes the name ""Panya"" an unlikely name for anyone.The author could certainly have selected a better name. I will not be purchasing this book despite the positive reviews it has received."
4,Great book -- and we like the recipe too!,"We had fun with this book -- my daughter thought the boy was just being ""bratty"" until we talked about how everyone contributed and how sharing led to more for everyone. Then she ""got it"", and now requests we read it often. The recipe for the pancakes is also easy and kids are able to help. Great book -- we also loved the illustrations -- some parts reminded us of life in Haiti which our Haitian-American kids loved."
4,"A good read, but only for Saberhagen fans....","This novel, really a novella, is not for anyone but a Saberhagen Berzerker universe fan, as it is not a stand alone book. If you have read a number of Berzerker series books, this one will make sense and be a good addition to your Saberhagen collection. If you pick this one up first, you will feel like you wasted your money.I only recently started reading all the Berzerker books, but that interest was started by reading a berzerker short story back in the 70's, which really stuck with me. So, I started buying used copies on Amazon. This one is just the latest. As a Berzerker fan, I highly recommend it.If you are puzzled by 'Berzerker' in the title, pass on by."
3,Hallman Pro Boost Controller,"Seller did not disclose anodizing defects on product exterior.Defects are cosmetic, but the Seller should have disclosed this information in the sales ad. I would not have purchased this item from this Seller had I known beforehand that the anodizing was defective. Because of the undisclosed defects, I do not trust this Seller and would not buy from them again."
5,Celine Dion:Let's Talk about Love-GREAT!,"Precised.Vivid pictures of Celine's best moments as an amazing artist.One of the best compilation,light and sleek.I highly recommend especialy for Celine fans."
5,Awesome Debut Album,"In their first album The Hippos show the promise of becoming one of the great punk/ska bands in the near future. From their opening track - Far Behind to the ending track Forget the World The Hippos show off an amazing blend of horns, vocals, guitar and drums.Throughout the cd you'll find tight vocal harmonies between Ariel, Rich, and Louis with amazing drum fills by Kyle, moving back and forth between pounding the drums to smooth rhythms on tom-toms. To bring the band full circle the brass section gives a lift to the cd that most punk/ska bands miss these days. Whatever son you pick you'll find a brass part you'll like whether it be the groovy trombone solo from Rich in Diane, tight brass harmonies in Irie, or great sax solos by Roman.If you want a fun, groovy, lay back, California ska band this is it. These guys show what it's like to have fun in music all over again. You'll never tire listening to this cd and it gets better each time you drop it in."
5,Definitely one of my favorite cds,"I was never a really big fan of ska (i actually didn't even know what it was) until i heard the hippos. Now i'm addicted to ska! They are absolutely great! Some of the songs are so funny, and they are all great, even the filler tracks :). If you want something fun to listen to...this is definitely it! And if you love this cd, you'll love ""Head Are Gonna Roll"" even more!"
5,Great ska/punk with unusual but fun percussion.,"I'm not sure any punks or ska dorks hang out on Amazon, I sure don't, but I saw this link and thought I'd do this c.d. some good. If you're already into ska, or new to the seen, the Hippos are a great addition to your collection. I'll admit, they sound a lot like every one's favorite sell outs Reel Big Fish, but they have a much cooler dimension -- their percusion is fantastic. Each song has the normal drummer going at it in the back round, but they have another percussionist banging away at bongos and other instruments usuaully not associated with run-o-the mill punk/ska. And I bet you're wondering if you can dance to this? Well, you skank you're little heart out too. Well, enough for now. Excuse the typoes and spelling errors."
3,Too Average,"While this album is decent there are barely any songs that stick out as being really good (Diane is the only one I can think of off hand). If you have no other albums by The Hippos and want to get one, the best choice would be Heads Are Gonna Roll. The songs on this album may not be bad, but after listening to it a few times you'll find yourself skipping over a good portion of the tracks to get to the ones that are worth while. Over all there's nothing on this album that would make it better than their other album, Head Are Gonna Roll, so don't bother."
5,mmmm hippos....,"the hippos just rock all around. This c.d. is one of the best I have ever heard, and although, yes, the hippos have not quight developed their own sound yet, there is no weakness in this album. Every song is perfect."
5,Forget the World ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The first time I saw the Hippos, they played with MxPx and since then I have never forgotten them! I knew right away after seeing them that I definately needed they're CD. I never liked ska until I heard them, they've changed my life! Spankx to :~Ariel,~Danny,~Kyle,~Louis,~James,&~Rich!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I L O V E Y O U G U Y S !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,this is not a good game,"This game sucks. The game play is bad, the graphics are bad, the game is all around bad. You don't want to play this game. Find another one."
5,Completely satisfied,"We had a 3 cup Zojirushi for a year, which we gave to our daughter to use in her dormitory. We decided to buy Sanyo as it is cheaper. We have used this for 2 months now and am completely satisfied with it. It is as good and has as many functions as Zojirushi. Rice is cooked as righ. My wife actually likes Sanyo better because the inner pot is much heavier and therefore does not move around as Zojirushi when she scoops the rice.Buy either Sanyo or Zojirushi. They are both quality products that will last for years.If you use rice cookers as long as we have, you will like this new generation type becasuse they never burn the rice on the bottom as the old generation did."
4,pretty good overall! (rice snob for 38 yrs),"This unit is really nice. The only drawback is the time it takes to cook a full (or even partial) pot of 'sticky rice' - might as well be an hour! The best solution I've come up with is to rinse the rice, add the water, pop the titanium coated pot over a low flame on the stove, and preheat to a boil. Drop it into the cooker, hit the cook button, and you'll save about 20 minutes. I've grown up with zojirushi's, sanyo's, hitachi's, etc - this little cooker does it 'ok' for me."
2,Good rice cooker but......,I'm generally pleased with the performance of this rice cooker - it doesn't burn the rice when cooking smaller amounts of rice unlike some of the other rice cookers that I have owned. The one item that really dimishes the appeal (no pun intended) of the product is the teflon peeling off of the interior of the cooking pot. It is coming off in 2-3 inch sheets. I've only had the cooker for about a year. I've e-mailed Sanyo and have received no response. I just want to know where/if I can purchase another cooking pot. This is what I consider an expensive rice cooker and I thought that I was paying for quality. I would not buy another Sanyo product.
1,Burned Out (Literally Burned) After Two Years,"I was looking for a good, small, fuzzy logic rice cooker for under $100 and this one fit the bill.It makes small batches of rice very well (which many cookers do not), cleans up easy and is not too bulky.UPDATE: Burned out after 24 months."
5,My third and best rice cooker.,Cooks evenly and the interior rice pot is very thick. They did not cut corners when manufacturing this product.
5,Sanyo 3.5 cup rice cooker,"The cooker is excellent, easy to use, fool-proof. We use it about three times a week."
1,defective recording,I own a high end Onkio DVD player. One of the 4 DVDs refuses to play on my player.
5,Charlie Chan movies,"The movies were great, the DVDs were in excellent condition. We now have a complete collection! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Charlie Chan movies."
5,The uncredited music in the Black Camel,"Most everything that needs to have been said has been except for the commentary track on the Black Camel which fails to make any mention of the beautiful hawaiian steel guitar music used in several points of the film which is devoid of music otherwise. I have heard that this contribution was from the greatest steel guitarist of them all who is Sol Hoopii. Sol was in big demand in Hollywood in the 20' and 30's as musical director, performer, actor, and as a talent scout for Hawaiian and polynesian themed movies. I marvel at the fact that the two male commentators were watching the complete movie and were not at all moved by the shear beauty of Sol's music to even make any comment about it. This film shot on location in Hawaii with a true son of Hawaii furnishing the slide steel guitar music is as good and as closed as it ever gets."
5,charlie Chan Volume 3,Fox has done an excellant job restoring the Warner Oland Charlie Chan Moviess in this collection. As an extra they recreated a lost Charlie Chan Movie by having people read the script while still photos appear on the screen. The only problem that I had with this was the person ding the voice of Chan was poor. It would have been better to have had a well known asian actor do the voice like Mako. Definately this volume is a must get for any Charlie Chan Fan.
5,"Charlie Chan, Vol 3","To those who are into old movies, I highly recommend these Charlie Chan movies. My wife and I really enjoy these compared to some of the crappy movies that is being made today. These are suspenseful, funny and wholesome movies."
3,Annapolis Grads Will Want Their Money Back,"Battlestations is a great game (don't short-quote me) for young kids whose dad or mom is in the Navy. They'll get a rudimentary understanding of the various vessels of our naval fleets, with a very cursory look at each vessel's armament and characteristics.Now to those of you who are looking for a naval strategy game, simulating vessels from PT Boats on up to the Aircraft Carriers, this game will not pass morning quarters inspection. The hydrodynamics (movement over, under, and through the water) was not only unrealistic...it was comical. Although the aircraft carriers did not turn on a dime, they were still swifter than any vessel Dennis Connor ever skippered!Time, tide and formation...save your money for (hopefully) a better game to come...or a yacht rental in the Chesapeake or San Francisco Bay."
2,Too much hype and not enough substance,"There was far more preaching than substance (90% preaching); I was really hoping for more specifics on HOW to create the separation; way too much emphasis on his opinions on the devil; not a waste of time, but be prepared to skim for the essential parts"
4,Dark Shadows the beginings,I didn't buy this product for me but for a birthday gift. Inow she really loved it she bought all of the twenty plus dark shadows and is now starting on the beginings. I was impressed on how fast it arrived.
4,Dark Shadows Fan,"If you like Dark Shadows, you will love the original episodes pre-Barnabus. Get to know the characters from the start."
5,Dark Shadows is a timeless classic!,"I have watched Dark Shadows on a regular basis ever since it's debut on the Sci-Fi Channel back in the '90s. Granted, the acting isn't the best, although I've seen much worse, and the budget was minuscule. Despite all that, the story demanded attention. I just wish I had been born about 15 years earlier so I could have enjoyed it first run. This box set is an excellent collection. While the story of Barnabas was the most popular on the series, this beginnings collection (before Barnabas) is ace as well. I recommend it to anyone whom is a Gothic cinema fan."
3,Why Barnabas was badly needed.,"The early story lines were just okay. The introduction of Barnabas Collins transformed the show into the cult classic that it is today. The price for these early storylines is way overpriced by MPI. In fairness to the true Dark Shadows fans, I think MPI owed us something better than the high price for 6 dvds. I truly felt cheated in Vol. 26 for 19 esp. Nothing against MPI, but you can`t be serious about the pricing structure of your product. In most of the dvd`d there was some type of distortion and video malfuction. I do understand it was from the master tapes. Again, the price of the dvd`s was to high compared to the quality we were given. I`ve been wanting to get that off my chest for years. I wish anyone well who chooses to buy the pre-Barnabas years. I`m not going to be one of them."
5,First time seen now,"OK, this is the first time I have seen now the serie on DVD (i have started a few days ago). Well... the episodes was taped 45 years ago. The Picture is not perfect but looks (with few moments) good.Of course its a little bit slow but still very interesting and its great to see Joel Crothers and Louis Edmonds. Great is to have interviews / indroducing to the show by Alexandra Moltke.Each box contains also a postcard with a character from the show."
5,Much better than the video,"I already have all of the B&W Dark Shadows episodes on tape, and I must say that I will be owning them all on DVD. It offers so much more to the quality of the story line and adds depth to the characters and their stories! You won't be disappointed with these DVD's!"
4,A revisitation,"I first came across Ian Kayes verse in the 60's when I was serving with the Black Watch and he produced 'An Amateurs Anthology"".I enjoy his work, and having lost my original copy sometime during several moves around the world it has been very rewarding to have been able to purchase a (used) copy through Amazon. 'Pick and Shovel Poems' is a very worthwhile read for anyone who has served in a scottish regiment and Amazon is to be commended for being able to find a copy."
4,Floater is a good sounding band.,This is the only Floater CD I've listened to. I think it's great. It has a somber sound which allows me to reminice of the days of sad hard rock -- but with a new sound all to its own. Good stuff.
2,Why?,"If you are a fan of the fictional world created by White Wolf in connection with the role-playing game Vampire the Masquerade and the failed Kindred TV-series, you have probably read the previous books in this series. As the last books in this series are not yet out, I am not giving this book a one star just in case in some way this book serves some function in advancing the thirteen novel series. At first read, this novel is only loosely connected with the other novels.As a stand alone novel, this novel is a complete jumble. While I guess it is supposed to reflect the madness of the Malkavian mind, this does not make for an enjoyable read. Nothing in this book makes sense separate from a vague connection with the previous novels."
1,Clan Novel : Malkavian,"I am an avid reader of all things Vampire, I have read all the Clan novels as they are released. This latest entry into the series is the first one I felt was just not very good. I understand that Malkavians are all mad but this book is enough to drive you over the edge. The story line was not advanced in this piece except to kill off a few more characters. Perhaps I'm missing something but you could of told this story in two pages, the rest of the book was just a wordy jumble of confused prose written in the first person then switching over to dialog between an ego and his ulterego. I know this is fantasy but give me a break, this series has been so good what has happened? I hope the last four novels in the series are as good as the previous eight, I guess thirteen great novels was just too much to ask."
1,I was really looking forward to this book,"but after only 18 pages, I had to give up. I love clan Malkavian, mostly because it is a rare person who can truly play one. A subtle clan to comprehend. I saw only one great Malk character in the novels so far, and he got killed in the first book (which tells me it's a rare author who can truly write a Malkavian). But this story is told in first person, which breaks the entire feel of the series, and of course, the teller is a mad man. I couldn't understand what he was talking about, or even how one sentence related to the next. Such an incomprehendable waste."
1,Clan Novel: Malkavian,"This book was the worst of the series. It is an extreme task to write a series of 13 novels. As a writer, I know this to be true. The writers must continue to hold the interest of the readers and they had done a great job up until this novel. Each novel took the reader deeper into the World of Darkness and made us interested in that world. The novels were easy to read and easy to follow. This one sets us back. I undersatnd that the writer tried to show us the ""madness"" of the protagonist but he forgot that this is a series and not a stand alone novel. It can easliy be skipped. If you want to enjoy the series as a unit skip it. There is a matter of style vs. subsatnce and the writer should have kept with the substance of the series and not the style of Anatole"
1,I do not recomend this book,"Wow, I read all the books up to this one, and every one pulled me deeper. THEN this book came out. It is filled with stuff that just doesnt make sence. It liked reading my sterio instructions more than this, and it was more entertaining.This book can and should be skipped... you miss nothing other than a small trip my Victoria Ash"
4,Great book,This was a great book that showed the Malkavaians as I always imagined them... crazy. But crazy in a smart way. The hallucnations in the beggining of the book are a tad confusing but you get used to it and the last half of the book does much to further the plot of the series.
1,"Poor. Tell a story, don't try to be an artist.","This was a sad book -- sad because the author tried to become William Faulkner and write in stream of consciousness. Unfortunately, unlike Faulkner, it ends up being unintelligible babble. This gets further complicated when the author misuses words (such as using the word ""debtor"" to indicate the person to whom a debt is owed, rather than the person borrowing). Mistakes like this kill the credibility..."
1,"Barely worth reading, if at all!","I thought that this was the worst book I have read in a while. While true the Malkavian are hard to figure out and understand, did the book have to be page after page of gibberish? You have to fight to even care what is in this book in the hopes that it makes sence later. It doesnt... Other than a few, VERY few parts that are even understandable it was not worth the paper it was printed on. Oh yea, and those few parts... they dealt with non-Malkavian topics.I read this book hoping to get someting for the series out of it, but if you skipped it, you would not miss anything. I think that the idea that to be Malkavian, you had to write pages that could not be understood was a terrible idea.This is tragic considering how much I LOVED every other book in the series!"
2,Was sadly dissappointed,"Unfortunately I thought the product was overpriced for the quality received. I found one for the same price at a hardware store that had a gage built in that measured the water going through. This would let you know when enough water had passed through for a small, medium or large shrub, and the same for different size trees. This one is simple bare bones."
3,A return to form!,"This album is welcome, especially after his last disc, the overproduced, almost-unlistenable ""Pisanlov."" This features a more melodic selection of songs and lyrics that are more grounded and less pretentious. It doesn't approach his great work of the '80s (""Cuando Seas Grande,"" etc.), but it's better than anything he's done lately."
2,What a disappointment!,"This is NOT Alabina! Alabina is a complete band, with HOT Latin Gypsy guitarists and passion. There's passion in this CD alright, but it's strictly Ishtar's...reserved FOR Ishtar! A self-indulgence that is largely devoid of the energy and FUN which made Alabina such an addictive, happy sound. ""The voice of Alabina"" says it all...she definitely has a fantastic voice, but this music is dull, dull, dull. If you want a Mariah Carey or Cristina Aguillera re-hash, done up in ""exotic"" French, Arabic, etc...fine. But just be forewarned, that is what you're getting with this CD. Nothing original, and a pale, washed out comparison to TRUE Alabina!"
5,"Ishtar ""Voice of Alabinia""","I love the music on this album. It is very lively and makes you want to sing along and dance, even though I don't understand the words except for ""Last Kiss"" which is sang partially in English. The majority of the songs, I believe are in French. Ishtar has a beautiful voice (a musical instrument in itself) I feel better than Celine Dion's. I heard her on a PBS radio station and found her album only available here. I feel it is money well spent and enjoy listening everyday. It just doesn't seem to ever loose its appeal. My only criticism of this product is when writing the words to the songs on the enclosed brochure that some of the pages and lettering doesn't have enought color contrast to make is easy to read (only on two songs). FYI, she speaks seven different languages and chooses to sing her songs in the language most pleasing to the ear."
5,Absolutely wonderful!!!,"This CD is absolutely wonderful. It is full of ethnicity, passion and just plain good music. It is great for any belly dancer and anyone who loves to listen to multi-cultural music. AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! :) :)"
4,Brian Mitchell shines,"I bought this after it was shown on PBS, principally because of Brian Stokes Mitchell and because I like the songs from South Pacific. Brian is a great singer and actor. Reba McEntire was good also, but I enjoyed the supporting cast with Lilias White as Bloody Mary and the young man who played Joe Cable. Both of them have terrific voices. Anyone who enjoyed the movie should also love this offering as well."
5,Absolutely delightful!,"Just finished watching this concert and I can't wait to watch it again. I had a few small problems with it (the tempo of some songs felt a bit rushed) but that was probably done knowing this was going to air on TV and that the show *had* to fit within a certain timeframe. Plus, you knew there was going to be that much applause!Great talent in this cast, but I'm especially blown away by Reba McEntire. I've only recently ""discovered"" Reba and as I find more of her work I'm constantly amazed. Every moment in this show she is totally engaging to watch and I can't tear my eyes away from her."
5,South Pacific,This dvd is a really good but anything with Reba in it is a great one for me to watch. The music is really great and the songs are wonderful. If anyone like sittting watching plays you can sit at home and watch this one. The other actors makes it as if you are there watching it.
5,brilliant spectacle,"I like this kind of shows (I recommend also Les Miserables at Albert Hall).It's other great musical of Rodgers & Hammerstein with a superb perfomance of Brian Stokes Mitchell(singing speaking. 'Some enchanted evening' for my sense, is far more better than the film), and a lady, full of grace and beauty, like Reba McEntire.I recommend this DVD for a people who love musicals. The sound is perfect and also the picture."
5,Reba McEntire South Pacific,"This Carnegie Hall production of ""South Pacific"" was wonderful. Even without benefit of full movie or stage visuals, McEntire, Stokes Mitchell and company ran me through the emotional spectrum. I recommend it without reservation."
1,South Pacific,I was disapointed with this product. It was read from a notebook by the stars. There were no costumes or beautiful sets. I suggest that you pass this one by.
5,South Pacific in Concert from Carnegie Hall,"I had seen part of this concert on Public Television but had come in at nearly the end as Brain Stokes Mitchell was singing; ""This nearly was mine"" I could hardly breathe as I listen to him. I knew I had to have the DVD to see this Concert from start to finish.I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed this Concert. Brain Strokes Mitchell is an amazing Artist, his voice leaves you breathless. Reba McEntire's performance demonstrated her talent far outreaches her background in country music. Alec Baldwin kept a smile on my face each time he preformed. My husband I were clapping our hands sitting in our own living room. I recommend this DVD to anyone that appreciates a wonderful evening of music and talent of outstanding performers.Bravo to all connected to this Concert.Gloria C. Chadwick8/20/06"
4,Not What I Wanted,Good concert I guess...but I wanted the musical. This is just singing the songs not much acting. If you want to hear the songs this is ok but dont purchase if you want the musical.
5,Brian Stokes Mitchell ls great,"The entire concert is excellent. I heard Brian Stokes Mitchell in person in March, so I'm especially interested in anything he does. Reba McIntire is very good too. I had seen this on PBS in the past."
4,Excelente musical!!,"Me encantó el musical... Nunca lo había visto, pero tiene imágen nítida y muy buen sonido.Lo malo: Falta de subtítulos... Puedes descargar la letra de las canciones en internet, pero NO los diálogos!"
5,South Pacific Shines,Wonderful performances from the entire cast. Brian Stokes Mitchell is perfct in the lead male role and Reba McEntire is perfect as Nellie Forbush. The voices are wonderful and the orchestra does Richard Rogers music proud.
2,Dreadful rehash of same stock characters,"Do not read this book first, as the earlier works are fresher, wittier. By the time I got to the scene between Clyde and Gordon in the bar, I was rooting for Gordon to grab Clyde by the throat and slap him but good. As usual, the sad-sack male becomes more miserable and the women sparkle brighter. I'm sick of Boston and your silly, jaundiced view of academe, sick of your migraines, sick of the loser already. (But loved Object of my affection and Easy Way Out was worth the quietly tragic ending.)"
3,"for a ""witty novel"" it is a downer","The author definitely has a way with an occasional insightful comment or witty line. But the greater bulk of the novel is about a group of VERY neurotic people -- mostly adults -- who meander through their lives waiting for something to happen. Jane Austen had the writerly sense to introduce at least one character to ""stir things up"" in her plots, but here we have a main character who is as stuck in a morass as much as all of the other characters. The writer ties things up at the end but honestly as a reader I felt like I was reading a book written by a very depressed writer, who wrote this book in order to think about his own neurosis. Too much like being forced to watch some stranger's therapy sessions."
4,Savage Boom Arm,"For the price this is a nice piece of equipment. I like the fact that they give you a bag you can fill with coins or sand or rocks. The boom arm seems strong enough, and extends fairly far out. I would not recommend putting too much weight at the very end of the arm with having a good amount of weight to counter-balance everything. I also say this because the plastic clamp-wheel that holds the arm in place is prone to slipping with excess weight. You can only crank it so tight. With that being said for the money, this is an excellent purchase for people seeking a well made boom arm at a low price.fightgregphotography"
4,"ring is nice, cover is ok","the ring is nice and sturdy, but the cover is just felt over something like cardboard..good price though"
2,"Great picture, too much interference","I was very impressed with the picture on this monitor. I liked how you can hook the camera right up to your crib for a great view of your baby. BUT there was way too much interference, to see the ""great"" picture for more than 2 seconds at a time. There was so much static. I tried all the channels and they were all equally as bad. We live in a townhome community, so even though our phones are 5.8 GhZ, and we do not have wireless internet, it's possible our very close neighbors may have 2.4 Ghz phones, (the same frequencey as the monitor), or maybe wireless internet. Thats too bad b/c a video monitor is a great idea. ~Kim"
4,It was just what I needed,"I have read some bad experiences with the product, specially interference with wireless routers and stuff like that. Since my home internet is wire LAN based, it does not bother me. The only thing I would have liked would be a battery for the camera. It is comfortable to use, friendly, and it has been quite reliable, so far."
3,Display not so good,"The reception is fairly good, however, the lcd display is one of the older types where it can only be viewed from certain angles. This makes it difficult to see when the unit is placed higher or lower than your field of view (ie. on a table top). The video camera works great in the dark, in fact it's excellent. The mounting system looks good for a crib, but it is not designed to use on a bassinet. I had to do some ""custom"" mounting to see my son in the bassinet. However, you can place the camera on a table or mount it to the wall if need be. Overall this is a good product, just needs a better screen."
1,Not worth the money,"Despite all the bad reviews, I still registered for and received this monitor as a shower gift wanting to see for myself. I completely agree with the other comments that this is a horrible monitor. It's very noisey due to all the static it produces. Definitely not something you could use at night while sleeping and forget about using any other electronics while it's on, especially the cordless phone.We were able to exchange this monitor for the Summers Infant video monitor. This one is much better and about $30 cheaper. I should have listened to the other reviews in the first place."
2,Horrible monitor,"This monitor has horrible reception. With my first child I bought the Sight and Sound Assurance Video Monitor. We love it. It gets awesome reception and I like the additional cordless sound monitor. Our only complaint was that the video monitor is a bit bulky. When we were expecting our second child we decided to buy this color view monitor. We liked the fact that the video monitor was compact. We tried it out and the reception is fine as long as we are no more than 10 ft away. The sound is horrible as well. It's very ""crackly"". I called the company and they stated there was nothing they could do. We unplugged our cordless phones to see what the difference would be...there wan't any difference. Not a great buy."
2,"Okay Monitor, Not Great","We purchased the most expensive video monitor thinking that we would ""get what we paid for."" I certainly hope there are better ones on the market. The sound on this monitor is not clear, there is a constant electronic-type hum. Pretty annoying when you're trying to catch some much-needed sleep! Also, while advertised as a color monitor, beware that the color is very ""washed out"" (reds look pale pink)and not significantly different from a black & white video monitor, even after adjusting the brightness. Additionally, the rechargeable batteries run down rather quickly (3-3.5 hours).Having said that, it IS wonderful to be able to ""peek"" at the baby without waking him/her. A video monitor is the way to go, but perhaps there is a better one out there."
1,HORRIBLE!,Does not work. So much static and picture quality is bad. Waste of money for soemething so overpriced not to work. Very displeased with this product.
2,not good for apartments,I would like this item more if I didn't live in an apartment building. I have to turn off the sound because it is all static the picture is ok but has static on it too. I can not find a monitor that is good for apartments. I hope to not live in one forever and it still helps me out a little to see the baby. In the end I am keeping the monitor but it needs some inprovements.
1,Waste of money,I have to agree with everyone else... don't buy this product! The static is horrible!! Not anywhere close to worth $200!!! Don't waste your time and money!!!
3,Not bad,"The baby still hasn't arrived, but I set it up and walked around the house a bit with the reciever. My house is not very big, and there are still places where the signal isn't very good. However, with a bit of tweaking, I can get it working adequately just about anywhere in the house. For the [...] that I paid, and considering how much the alternatives cost, I think that it works fine.I did check, however, that not many of my wireless devices are on the same frequency before I bought it. This seems to be the main concern for any monitor that you might buy. So...if you wan't an economic option, and your wireless devices aren't on this frequency, and your house isn't too big, this device seems adequate to me."
2,DON'T BUY from BABYAGE or this monitor!!!,"My review is ditto those below it, but it is worse! My monitor also will not run with my wireless devices in the home, yet unlike all other unhappy customers before me, BABYAGE REFUSES to take it back, won't even give me a refund, all with much attitude on the phone! I called Safety first and Amazon and all can do nothing apparently, but now I am out the money and stuck with a monitor that to me is useless. This babyage site is UNBELIEVABLE...DON'T BUY FROM THEM WHATEVER YOU DO!! BUYER BEWARE!"
2,not good,"we tried this monitor twice. the first time the sound didn't work, and i had to ship it back to the company. amazon shipped a new one and it worked for a week and then the video portion went out. while it worked it was great, but not reliable at all."
1,terrible reception,"This monitor has terrible reception. You can't see the picture clearly unless you look directly at it. It is far from clear or color. Do not buy this monitor!! Plus once you mount the camera onto the crib you can't really use it for anything else except when your baby is in the crib. Great idea, just the technology is far from being where it should for the price!!!!!!!"
1,What a waste!,I bought this monitor at the babiesrus store based on a reccomendation from one of the employees. She said a lot of people bought this item and she never got any complaints or returns. Well I took the monitor home and sset it up and it worked wonderfully from the next room. Well that night I took the monitor in the bedroom (about 30 feet from her room) and the reception went horrible. It got a lot of static and became very annoying. I tried putting it on different channels and finally decided that channel 3 was tolerable (although it still got a bit of static). The next day my laptop went haywire. I couldn't get my wireless card to see the router and after hours of frustration figured out that it was the monitor interfering. Do not buy this product if you have a wireless network in your home. It's a complete waste of money.
3,linguistics for non-linguists,"They said that the book is looked like very good condition.But, it's different."
4,Very good resource,"I'm CEO of a medium size business and wanted a resource to teach me accounting. This is a great book, with plenty of assignments which fully reinforce the lessons. The only disappointment is that there are no solutions and the publisher only gives them to you if you are a registered teacher."
5,Great book for Engineers,"This book was part of our text for the MBA program. Being an Engineer having no background in Accounting, this easy to understand book has been very helpful. The chapters build upon one another. One topic naturally leads to the other. The practice problems at the end of the chapter are very good for cementing the learning. The book is scattered with lots of real life examples and problems representing real companies. Buy this book with the solutions manual."
3,good book late arrival................,"The book is in good condition but it arrived a week after I ordered it, it was supposed to arrive within 2 days with prime 2 day shipping. Little late doing homework but the book is in good condition."
4,A Good Starting Point,"I like this book because it focused on Proverbs. If I and my children could memorize the whole of Proverbs, I think we'd be better for it. Its a good simple book. I appreciated the sequence of topics. I liked the pictures at the beginning of each chapter. I actually made copies for the kids (8,6 and 4) to color while I read them the story. Every morning was a short reading (which is good for small children's attention span) with questions. Sometimes I asked the questions verbatim, sometimes we discussed other questions we thought of. I liked the activities in the back that related to the lesson. Every Friday, if the children had the memory verse memorized, they got a treat. So, I think this book is what you make of it. You can make it into a good bible study or perhaps just a reference book. Either way, its a good purchase."
4,Good book!,"We liked it. I like the fact that the chapters deal with individual traits (ie-controlling anger, honoring parents, lying, etc) There are scriture cards included to help with memorizing and a neat game. Each chapter also starts with a good cartoony kind of full page illustration with the main scripture that you could copy for the kids to color and make a notebook."
3,Decent garden helper,"Takes a little getting used to, but once you get a rhythm going, this thing will save you a lot of time and backaches. Great for edging small areas like flower beds or gardens. I wouldn't recommend this thing for large areas like long sidewalks unless you have the whole day to kill and want a good suntan. Get a edger attachment for your weed wacker or bite the bullet and buy a commercial edger for those jobs."
3,Good for small areas,"I have a very long driveway with a huge bermuda grass invasion problem. The Hound Dog did a pretty good, clean job of edging along the drive, but I got tired of the manual job and tried the electric trimmer again. I plan to use the Hound Dog for touch ups because I hate using the trimmer."
5,Best little tool ever!!,"I purchased this product a couple of months ago and it works beautifully around beds as well as along sidewalk and driveway. It cuts through ""crab"" grass which grows over every barrier that exists. I love it - it is quiet and no exhaust smells. I can edge almost as fast as my husband with his noisy, smelly high-tech edger - even he was impressed. If it ever breaks or bends I will purchase another one - it has earned its place in my tool collection already and FYI - no one paid me or requested this review and I don't usually write reviews, but this has worked so great that I was inspired to take the time to review the Hound Dog."
3,Steppin with my Step Edger,"First off, the productHound Dog Products Steppin' Edger #HDP6-4arrived in a much larger box than it needed. The box was filled with yards of paper. I finally found the Step Edger in and around the paper in which it was wrapped. The edger comes with a guard on the blade. I didn't see it and tried to use it with the gaurd. Rectifying my mistake I proceeded to edge. It took while to get the knack of the process. One must make tiny steps and keep the back of the edger down in the sod next to the sidewalk. It works better with two. One steps and edges and the other crawls around behind and removes the sod and sweeps. I think my right leg is bigger than my left from the every two weeks work out. It works. It is pretty sturdy. Once you get the rythm down you move right along."
1,Does less than half the work,"It seems to cut. I developed ""good style"" with it. But when I went to remove the grass I edged, it appears that the blade only pushed down the tougher ""runners"". Yes, I removed the blade guard! Yes, I edged 3 times, trying to get as close to the concrete as possible.Still, I had to use a short-handled shovel to scoop it, and it would lay over itself. That is when I saw it wasn't really cutting it all. Maybe the blade needs to be deeper. So, I had to really hit it with the shovel to cut it.I could've saved my money and used the shovel itself. Funny, the shovel is made by the same company!"
2,be cautious,"I sort of like this product but don't love it. It does as promised to a point -- you step on it and it edges -- but i had to go back over my grass with a power edger to clean up what i missed with the steppin edger.The nice thing is it requires no gas, makes no noise and emits no smoke. The bad thing is it just doesn't work as well as a power unit."
3,hound dog edger,I loved it but after awhile it bent i was so mad it is a good product but needs to be stronger Iloved it but can't use it anymore
3,edger,"It sounds like a good idea and probably is for people who weigh enough. I weigh about 135 and find I am not heavy enough to cut through grass. Therefore, I have been disappointed, but feel it would be okay for others who weigh more."
1,Worthless pile of crap,"Looked like a neat tool. Totally useless on a regular lawn, maybe if you have a golf green lawn with a sand foundation it would work great. If you have normal 2-3"" lawn grass it doesnt work worth a damn, you practically have to jump on the thing to get it through the grass. Neat idea but it doesnt work, the positive reviews on this thing must be company hacks trying to make their products sound better than they are."
5,You Just cant stop skanking,I saw Edna's Goldfish live in concert. They were a suprise guest at a Reel Big Fish concert I was at. They are the most amazing Ska band I have ever seen live. There wasn't a single person in the place who wasn't skanking to the tunes. I had to go out and buy this album. Every song on the album is amazing. Anyone who is a serios ska fan should pick this one up
5,Gone in Sixty Seconds Soundtrack,"I'll be brief. This was an amazing blend of music. Old, new, pop, rap. You name it, it's got it. It's rare for me to like more than two songs off any CD, but this one is a great find. I love every song."
3,There's a new edition!,"This is a very good commentary on the Critique of Pure Reason that usually interprets it in the most charitable way. If you're out for economy, buy a used copy of this--but be aware that there is a new, considerably expanded edition of this book that Allison has put out, and the changes are worth the money."
1,Achingly boring...,"Martin Mull can be hilarious when he wants to be, and that's what I was expecting. However, this tape is completely mislabeled; it's not stand-up at all. What we're 'treated' to is a collection of small town people playing instruments badly, unfunny sketches, and drawn-out stories with no point. The few guest stars do nothing, despite their best efforts, to save this waste of film. Avoid. This will only lower your opinion of Mr. Mull, a man who is capable of much better."
4,Musashi...the chosen one!!??,This game is so sword slicing cool!! I like the flesh sucking demons that come out at night. (Which you will incounter through the game.)If your a musashi hater... I have my own army.
4,One Flaw,"Great game. Entertaining storyline and voices. Fun concept on being the ""hero"".The one flaw I have noticed is a need for more save points. Several times i found myself either continuing on when i didn't want to, or just turning the game off without saving simply because I was not able to find a spot to be able to log my progress."
4,A ver y good game,"Alright it looks like a Zelda clone on the surface but it has litttle in common. and another thing, it may look like a easy game but its anything BUT!!!!!!!! this game would have been perfect if it wern't for a couple of problems: the game is not long enough, fixed camera angles. aside from that its perfect."
5,Final Fantasy meets Zelda.,"I remember having a demo of this game as a kid and I loved to play the demo. Now, I saw it for 15$ and decided to get it. It's better than I remembered.GAMEPLAY: A fine mix of action, Zelda, and RPG. You play as Musashi, the summoned hero. Slaying enimies and solving tricky puzzles in the dungeons. Kinda like Zelda. Musashi has two swords, Fusion, which can swipe fast and turn enimies into powers, [like Kirby] and Lumina, which is slow, powerful, and when you find the Scrolls, can use element power. There is much more things to do, but I'll let you find that on your own.GRAPHICS: They kind of look like FFVII's graphics: Very pologonal characters, but a bit more detailed this time.MUSIC/SOUND: As usual, very good.VOICE: This is the first Square game to have voice acting. The voices can be kind of cheesy, but are very good for a first attempt.Overall, a great game. If you like Zelda, you will like BFM."
4,"Great gameplay, but the voices get annoying!","For RPG fans and adventure fans alike, this game is for you. It combines the two so perfectly that it is a great gaming experiance. However, this is only put down by the annoying voices."
2,otaku,"Brave Fencer Musashi is one of the most horrid things ever to come out of Square. In fact, the only game by square that is worse is Ehrgeiz. The gameplay in Musashi is okay but the dubbing and puzzles are all very low rate, if you're looking for a fantastic RPG, check out Xenogears or Final Fantasy (any of them)."
2,Not for your average gamer,"I am a professional gamer and this is the hardest game i have ever played, not only that, but there is rarely any action to it, so dont let the beginning fool you, this game is worth it if you are professional, i beat it, but not very many people have, ... the worst buy i have ever bought, so dont get it unless it's cheap"
3,THE POOR ATTEMPT OF SONY TO MATCH N64 ZELDA,"My title says everthig , this is a poor attempt by sony to COPY the legend of zelda , same style , same dsign of characters , except musashi , the princess , and everyone else of this gsme is so STUPID , and CHILDISH ARRRGGGThis RPG is OK .......... and NOTHING MORE"
5,Awesome flavor,"This is one of the only ""edible"" lubricants out there that is, in fact, edible. The flavor is great. Not dissimilar to a jolly rancher.As far as the feel goes, both I and my girlfriend think that this is the most natural feeling lubricant we have tried, that it works well for any type of play, and doesn't dry out quickly. Typically, a little of this stuff goes a long way. Plus, its hypoallergenic, so its great if you're worried about reactions (we were). Finally, its a vegan formula if you care about that kind of thing (we didn't).Great product. There is a reason that they sell so much of it at the top sex shops in Hollywood."
2,Pink Lemonade Flavor is Disgusting,"I suppose it's an okay lubricant, but I won't be using it because neither my boyfriend nor myself like the taste. It's obviously sugar-free, but I wasn't expecting for it to taste so sugar-free. Usually sour-tasting things taste fine sugar-free, but the pink lemonade flavor is sweet in a nasty, sugarless kind of way and not sour at all. I can't say that no one will like it, but I would avoid it unless you love the taste of sugar-free candy."
4,"A little sticky, but tastes great","The Sliquid gets the job done and tastes better than most lubricants. I find it a bit sticky when there's some left-over on your fingers, but not too bad. It makes the whole room smell like blueberries and works great. I would definitely recommend this product."
1,Disappointed,"All you can do with this toy is move the arms up and down (not in a karate chop motion) and move the legs. There's no karate chop involved. I got it for my 4-yr old grandson, and he was disappointed that it didn't do what he thought it would."
3,Ok for the $,"Really needs power to shine. Does not compare well to Infinity or Boston Acoustic, sensitivity is low and sounds rather dead, though there is a flat response, not overly colored."
5,An Excellent Book!,"This book is the best fantasy book I've ever read! the characters were great and their personalities depicted well, and the story line was captivating. I could not put this book down, and was anciously turning every page! highly recommend to any dragon lover!"
3,"Slightly dissapointing, but convulted and interesting","Dragoncharm is a so-so book. It's great in some areas, but lags in others. On the bad side, the narrative is often formal and extended, and the fact that it's almost always Fortune making the right choice gets tedious. Also, he falls in love with Gossamer far too easily, and he seems remarkably clairvoyant for a dragon who isn't old enough to fly. The plot is also dragged out an some points, with needlsess exposition On the other hand, this novel is incredibly creative, and is quite epic in its scale. All in all, not a bad novel, but some things could have been better."
4,An facinating story about the life of a dragon,"This is a rather unusual Book the (first of three) The author puts you in a world inhabited by dragons,but it's from the dragons point of view.No humans are featured in the book at all.The dragon rules supreme.The characters are very well defined and the become your friends (or in some cases,enemies).If you like books about magic and dragons,try this one."
3,"Fresh and unique, but not something that I can't put down","Seeing a fantasy adventure unfold through the eyes of dragons is fresh, rather refreshing.... particularly in a world where dragons are the predominant species (humans are inexistent so far....). But the writing is only mediocre and the pace of both plot as well as character development are somewhat inconsistent. There are moments where things happen too quickly (e.g. Fortune's falling in love with Gossamer) and others where there is too much dwelling on the journey and minor details that do not contribute much to the character or plot. Feels as though there are moments of lull while the author searches for inspiration on how to carry on.An interesting read, but certainly not something that I will lose sleep over."
3,okay - with faults,"Wouldn't a school like Faraday insist that the parents of a disturbed student get her some professional help, or at least remove her from the premises?Catriona's father didn't want her to go to a mental hospital because they might notice her blood type precluded her being his child? Please.Would the police insist on following a woman to the bathroom for her protection, but not bother checking that the bathroom was safe before letting go in? Come on! That just seemed like a quick way to wrap things up.This is the first of Janet Neel's books I've read. I'm disappointed because she writes well enough, but the mystery part of it seemed lacking--boring even--although I didn't guess who'd done the deed. Francesca and Alex were interesting enough as characters. Jamie was too saintly to be believable. The others never gelled for me as complete people.I will look for more of Neel's books. Maybe this one was a fluke."
4,"Disjointed, but kids will love it","For those who are new to the Eyewitness format, it consists of thematically arranged two-page spreads of brilliant photographs on a white background. There is an intro paragraph in the upper left-hand corner, but most of the text is in the captions that go with the photographs. Generally, the biological sciences titles are the strongest in this series, since other topics often need a more organized progression of topics. You'll get a lot of information out of these books, but you won't get a systematic anaylsis.This is a decent addition to the series. The information is rather dated, and this entry particularly suffers from the bite-sized, disconnected spreads that are arranged thematically rather than progressively or chronologically. However, the spreads themselves have a very high ""cool"" factor and are interesting and are coherent within themselves. Though practical use is limited, any child who loves spies or James Bond will adore this book."
3,Good Set of Music However.....,Received on time and in good order.Would have given it More Stars but Windows media Player comes up with info of disc # 1 of the 2 Disc Set version After 30 years life is Just for living.
3,Trilogy of complacency,"This set comes with some good 3 games, but it's nothing to get really excited about except the fortune of just having them all together instead of buying them all separately. Having never play this series I expected it to be oh, I don't know, a little more exiting. Yes, it has its moments but none of the 3 really captured my attention as other action ""drama"" games like GOLDENEYE or even the lowly Bond games. From a 1 to a 5 I guess me, personally would give it a 2.5 rating , but then again I'm not a ""Gamer"" and might get blasted by them. I think that only when YOU play them, YOU will oviously make your own judgement."
4,Hitman Blood Money- the best,"I bought this for my boyfriend and you can really see a difference in the graphics. He tried playing the first two of the trilogy. Got bored quick, and went to the third one (blood money).He absolutely loves that one! It is definitely a big difference."
4,Balanced assessment of the UN,"There is not much new in this book for those who follow the UN, but it is a balanced assessment. His reform recommendations err on the conservative side, although he does show how the US Congress imposes limits on the organization and then blames it for not doing more. The book is intended for a general readership rather than scholars or those with an in-depth knowledge of the UN."
1,VERY Boring,"While very informative and in-depth, this book on the UN is most of all... boring and terribly difficult to get through. Even the economics section (which SHOULD be somewhat interesting) was putting me to sleep. Will be my first and last Kennedy book"
3,"""or why I'm in love with the UN""","The author believes in world government, with the UN being the first step in that direction. Anything or anyone who is not on board with that agenda is open to either criticism or total dismissal as irrelevant. In not so many words the author effectively is willing to throw out the US Constitution if it conflicts with a decision made by this ""world"" body consisting of socialists, monarchists, anarchists, petty dictators and some not-so petty dictators - with the occasional democracy. Of course, the Security Council Permanent Members - mostly democracies with the exception of Russia and China - comes under criticism for having too much influence as well as not being able to act decisively and in the world's best interests rather than their own. If this is the best case for the UN's enormously broad mandates, let's tighten the reins. The US is still the world class example of governance; there is no room to compromise on our principals."
2,"Very similar to the Chinese game ""BIG 2""","Very soon after I played this game, like 2 minutes into this game, I instantly had this feeling: Why is this game so much like BIG 2?""BIG 2"" is a game play with regular playing cards and I believe originated from Hong Kong and then migrated to Taiwan, China, and Southeast Asian countries and then U.S.If you know BIG 2, skip this game, don't waste your money. This is a almost complete ripped-off of BIG 2 with slight modification.My two cents for this game: Forget this game, go get your playing cards out and play BIG 2 cuz it's more fun."
3,A nice idea - execution still lacks,"The Bad: These digital frames are a nice idea, but the execution is still lacking. The resolution is 384 x 234, but the pixalation looks even worse than that - they seem to be kind of widely spaced apart which adds to the effect. As a result, the pictures look much better from a little distance where astigmatism can help smooth them out.The Good: The memory card reader and the interface work very well. It's easy to cue up a nice slideahow, though a randomizer on the transitions would be nice.Conclusion: I paid around $200 for mine - it is a present for my grandmother. I think she'll get a kick out of it, but if I had to do it again I'd look for something with better resolution."
3,Questionable Quality,"The VistaFrame has turned out to be more of a novelty, rather than a good piece of photo displaying equipment. The resolution of the pictues displayed is grainy. The further away you view the display, the better it appears. None the less, it is fun to display pictures like this without the necessity of the computer."
2,Terrible as a textbook,"I didn't think it was possible to make linear algebra (one of the most straighforward subjects in mathematics) appear either confusing or complicated, but this book has managed to accomplish just that. The writing is incredibly dense and the assortment of fonts and symbols that all look alike (u's that look like v's and so forth) don't make reading the proofs any easier. If you are trying to learn linear algebra, find another book, any book - seriously.On the other hand, if you already know linear algebra and are looking for a different perspective or for a concise reference, I suppose this would work just fine."
2,Can you say obfuscate?,"Concise, yes it is. Overly concise? Absolutely! I was completely, 100% befuddled by the thing! Put it this way, this is not a useful text if you are trying to learn Linear Algebra for the first time. Try ANY other linear algebra book for a first go. Then, maybe later, come back to this."
1,THE HORROR!,"I have had better quality TV's from the Goodwill store. I bought my Tatung TV about a year and a half ago. Mine was actually a bigger one than this one but same brand. Right from the begining it had problems with the screen going out whenever it had an all white background on whatever show or commercial we were watching. I called customer service and they told me to do a reset and that it was probably my cables. I got tired of calling them and them not helping me so I just lived with the problem. Now, just a little over a year of having the TV, it just won't even turn on anymore. I paid 798.00 for this piece of crap and they won't honor their product. I guess its ok for a 798.00 TV to just stop working as long as its been over the one year warranty mark. This company should have stuck to making microwaves. I would NOT buy anything from this brand ever again. Try Goodwill, you will probably get more for your money."
3,Fun Old Game,Only problem is the PC version runs at 640x480 This version runs at 320x240. But the PC version wont run easy on newer systems.
2,DIABLO II,"Excellent graphics and game play but problems. You cannot save the game when you want to. Every time you die and reload, you have to start in town. Every time you reload the game, the monsters regenerate in the levels that have been completed. This makes the game very tedious. In Blizzard's efforts to make the game harder they have added unnecessary tasks that take the fun out of the game. They have done to Diablo what Quake did to Doom (not that Quake is a bad game) -make it overly complicated at the expense of fun. Also a few bugs - wait a few months before you buy."
4,diablo is fun,but after a while diablo get s boring all u do is go to different lvls in the church i beat the game as a lvl 24 warrior(not multiplayer) then i got diablo 2 lots more places to go more weapons that can do 800 damage u also kill diablos brother misqueto it and on diablo 2 expansion u kill his other brother baalPs im not sure if thats how u spell misqueto
5,Diablo,"Once in a while, an awsome games comes along and everyone is just stunned about how great it is. They might say how fun it is and how you should get this. I'm not telling you that you have to buy Diablo, but I reccomend it. It is definetly worth a try if you're a big action/RPG gamer and don't mind some gore. It has wonderfully beautiful graphics. Add some bone crunching sounds into it and it's a masterpiece. This will definetly be a game that you will not stop playing until you beat it. If you don't buy this game, you're getting left out. But then again, this is just my opinion."
1,Would not recommend,"I purchased this product from a local garden supply store. I have made 2 batches of the nectar, following the directions extremely carefully the 2nd time to make sure I didn't screw up on the first batch ... and no birds this time either. They fly right by it barely even stopping to take a look and go to the neighbors feeder. Waste of money...back to making my own."
1,?!,The item delivered WAS NOT the item shown on the web page. Very aggravating. Cost too much to return ship to bother with.
4,Great Solar Power,"I was a bit skeptical about these panels when I originally tested it, but in the end it performed excellent. I use it to charge my Duracell power pack 600hd and it charged fully in 4 to 5 hours. I noticed that you don't need full sunlight for this panel to work but the more sunlight the higher output of course. Don't plan on using this panel to power AC electronics its not designed for that. My inverter only powered up to about 15 watts ac power or one 13Watt CFL bulb. It also is good for charging cell phones or anything under 15 watts. On the negitive side I have not tried this product in wet weather and I don't think that I will as it's not water sealed very well, and I've noticed so far the stands that prop up the panel aren't very robust and would not hold up in much wind."
3,"Bulky, but does the job","I wanted to like this product as I love helping any endeavor that decides to sell solar products. I've been trying to see where it's made, no where on the unit itself or the literature does it say. I'm curious because it seems like it's put together by some guy in his garage from off the shelf parts. Except for a few design weaknesses (it doesn't close well and can dangerously pinch the power cable if one isn't extremely careful), it does generate decent power.If this, however, is made in some big factory in China -there are much better products available for the money (the Brunton 26 watt is an excellent unit)."
4,Whitney,I got this book for my husband who is a true Whitney fan. He was happy about it and has not said anything negative so it must be pretty accurate.
3,Denver County,"If you like the sound of a ""Denver Country"" you will love this CD.Otherwise, you'll be sorely disappointed, as I was."
4,"Works well, uncluttered remote.","I didn't get this player for the DivX capability, I mostly got it to be a good player for vhs and dvd and it has been doing those well. I tried out a variety of DivX/XviD files and all the ones I tried worked fine. Though most of the ones I tried had more standard resolutions, usually 640x480 or 640x360. Seeking through the DivX files worked suprisingly smoother than I thought it would. 2x seek was just a playback at faster speed with no audio, 4x and faster was more of frame jumping but it still worked pretty well, plus the normal chapter jump buttons would move forward/back 5 minutes.I rather liked the remote as it was fairly simple. There aren't a whole lot of buttons, and most of the more complex toggles and controls are in a menu system. I much prefer this over my previous VCR which had way too many buttons, far too many of which if bumped accidentally could screw things up."
1,Skips and Freezes,"This player will not play my Sony brand DVD-R's. It loads and tries to play but skips a lot. I did get a Memorex DVD+R to play. Samsung's tech support told me when it comes to playing burned DVD's it all depends on ""What program you use to burn disks, the brand of disk and what format you are using."" Wow...I just want to put a disk in and have it play. I have a $25 cheapo that plays all formats. For $100 you can do better than this unit."
2,I was underwhelmed with this product,"I bought this DVD/VCR combo a little over 2 years ago, and I really liked the idea of a combo unit because I have a decent collection of both VHS and DVD movies.For the first year or so I was very pleased with the product. But then, when I tried to switch from the VCR function to the DVD player function, nothing happened. For some reason the DVD function had failed, and now I had a unit that was effectively only a VCR. I couldn't use the clock feature either because that was controlled by the DVD side of the unit. At the time I had a Playstation 2 so I could still watch DVDs, but I've since gotten rid of that.I took it in to a local home electronics repair shop, and the estimate to get the DVD side repaired was $340!! I'm going to take that money and buy myself a better quality DVD/VCR combo.Buyer beware!!"
1,SORRY BUT THIS PLAYER IS TERRIBLE,"purchased in 2005, have used a lot, but it still shouldn't have died in 3 years! Will not buy Samsung product of this type ever again! Don't buy it, you'll regret it."
1,WORTHLESS,"We have hardly used this player and already it is broken. The DVD door will not open any longer, and to remove our son's DVD we are going to have to take the whole thing apart! We were disappointed from the get go with how SLOW it worked. It takes a long time to load and skip scenes. NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY! Buy another brand altogether. When we replace this one, WE WILL!"
1,DEAD OUT OF THE BOX,NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO TRY IT OUT. IT TURNED ITSELF OFF AFTER RUNNING FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS. TRIED TO GET IT TO STAY ON MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE PACKING IT UP AND SENDING IT BACK. I RECOMMEND AVOIDING THIS DECK.
1,Waste of time and money,The text is so garbled with OCR mis-recognition and there doesn't seem to be any way to get directly to a page I want from the page I'm currently on.
3,Lacks Quality,"If you are looking for just a set of dominoes to play with, then these ar for you. But if you want a good set, continue looking elsewhere. These dominoes are nice and solid, but the paint details of the dominoes left a lot to be desired. To be honest, it looks like my youngest child painted the numbers and lines, and they look like they were previously used. As the saying goes, you get what you pay for."
1,Sad Excuse for a Humidifier,"I was horrified by how cheaply made this machine was... even the holmes nameplate was attached upside down.More than that it didn't work out of the box. The directions were hard to understand. There is no on/off switch.Please, this is just JUNK."
1,needs to be recalled,the first one I bought home leaked about a gallon of water after about a hour...I returned it and got another... worked fine for 5 or so hours... I checked it to see if it was leaking and I went to bed ... I got up in the morning and all the water leaked out all over the floor... could have been a very dangerous situation...
4,Wonderful purse!,"I really love this purse. It's hard to find a nice purse that is not giant or too small. For those of us with kiddos, this allows me to hold what I need. This is very fashionable, goes with almost everything. Has a great little pocket for my cell phone, and another for keys or little things. It's roomy, and not so big that it overpowers me. I have those wonderful canvas totes, but they are giant and bottomless. This is great. It's an awesome buy. I wouldn't mind having it in some other spring fabrics and colors."
5,A must purchase,Buy it as soon as you can and protect your Leica lens. I delayed buying this and had water drops splash my lens both at Disneyland and Universal Studio. I use it with Lumix LX5. You need to buy DMW-LA6 adapter and a separate 52mm lens cap for using this with Lumix LX5. The is no problem of vignetting or brightness reduction. This filter is of original Panasonic make as mentioned in the specs. It came in its original packing and I am using it without any trouble. Also get a lens cleaning pen.
1,Heating element for Marvin Heater,I ordered this item 3 times from 3 suppliers and ended up with a total of ZERO items. Two companies shipped this glass heating element with no support packing and they arrived broken. There was a 99% chance they would not survive without protection. The other company didn't have as advertised. I did receive a refund from all the companies but wasted over 2 weeks trying to buy one on internet... Mike Sweeney
1,Discontinued Product,"The WB Marvin Company is out of business and the product that I received did not fit the heater that I have even tho my heater is on the list. No way to return, stuck with it, can't use! Don't order this item under any circumstance."
4,Great Game!,"This game was great, but there were some flaws: 1st was I hated how you had to return to your stance after you struck, this could get you killed. 2nd Some of the physics were messed up, like if the computer threw their sub-weapon, and it would hit your knee as you were trying to jump, it kills you..., or it hits you in the foot you die. 3rd To few weapons, the first had better weapons, like the hammer. Other than those reasons this game was great, it's much better that games with life meters and timers and super-move meters. Plus being able to cut down the background was fun."
3,Mediocre at best,"Bushido Blade 2 is fun, with a realistic fighting system and easy control functions, but at this stage in the world of video games, it just doesnt measure up.There is very little storywise, which is a shame because with one it could have been a great game. The character dialouge is possibly the worst ever written...and not even some very good (and fairly well known) voice over actors can salvage it. So what you get are sections between fights with main characters where there are short CG movies with really poor dialouge and almost as bad animation.Replay value is just barely there. Even with a fairly large character selection, once you've sliced and diced your way through the game a few times your ready to put it down.On top of all this is the fact that the game has become rare and pricey; the game is fun, but not worth the price."
2,"Good Graphics, horrible game",I played this game for 10 hours straight...being instructed by someone who has owned the game for a long time...and i HATED ITi found no strategy to it...just hit the button and get luckyEhrgeiz is WAY better
1,sub par,"When I played my friend's Bushido Blade (first one), I found itamazing. So I went to buy the second one, and gues what? It sucksroyally. Of course, it was cool in the beginning, but I quickly got bored of it. There are fewer weapons, which is the major drawback when comparing with the first BB, and the story game is a total bore. There are many more characters, but most of them have very similar moves anyway. The best parts are probably the school vs. school fights. Anyway, I sold it to some gullible guy I know. Don't get this, get the original."
2,"Its Origional, but The First Bushido Blade is Better!","Busido Blade 2 is as original as fighting games get. One strike one kill style Asain sword fighting. As for how that translates to game play though, give me a boreing old overhead life bar anyday. The rounds in Busido Blade 2 last seconds. It is near imposible to block a sword strike! In the origional you could at least defend yourself a bit making it a much better game. So only play this if you are the most die hard fighting fan. I will take Tekken 3, or Street Fighter Alpha 3 over this every day and twice on Sunday!"
1,bad,forgot how bad graphics were then BUT that is irrelevant the story line sucked royally. there's no real challenge unless you play another human but in the end it's all about luck really.
1,This game was a yawner.,"Made by the same producers of the Tekken series, I was quite surprised to have found this game extremely boring. The movie-bits that come programmed in this game were decent enough to watch, but the load time and the actual game play were slow and unexciting. If you're into fast paced action type fighting games, this one is not for you. You'd probably enjoy other fighting games like Soulblade (or Soul Edge, I keep forgetting the exact title) or any one of the Tekken games better than this one."
5,this is the best fighting game i've ever played.,"if you like martial arts fighting games and adventure games and tournament games, then you'll love bushido blade II. it is the bee's knees and i can't get enough!"
2,did not live up to expectations,"I ordered this after it was recommended by fellow Mom's of Mulitples. My girls kept spitting out their pacifier and then crying. Friends said that this could be laid next them and it would stay in their mouth. The Wabbanub hardly has any weight to it at all and is about 1/3 the size of a ""beanie baby."" Basically it was useless. I didn't return it, because it isn't any worse than their normal soothies, and they do look cute when they are hugging it."
1,Not a big fan,I understand the idea behind this but think there are better products out there. Maybe you will feel differently. I dont recommend.
2,Cute but.....,"The Pink Horse Wubbanub is really cute and well made. Those are the only positives I can give. When I opened the package, there was a very distinct ""petroleum"" smell to the Wubbanub. I'm assuming this came from the glue that holds the pacifier in the stuffed animal. I boiled the pacifier three times (which is difficult) and washed it several times before the smell went away. My daughter does not like the pacifier at all. She repeatedly spits it out. As one of the previous reviewers stated, the Pink Horse is not very big at all, and is of no assistance in keeping the pacifier in my daughter's mouth. I do not recommend this product."
5,LOVE IT! My little girls favorite!,"I love this product!! I would love for the pacifier to have a cap... but other than that is great!! My little girl started using it around 2.5-3 months, before that she couldnt hold the horse, but now she loves it and grabs it without a problem!! It makes it easier for her to put it back when it falls too!"
1,strap is way too small to have it fit right,"Metal seems flimsy and the strap isn't long enough to come down to the right place. I am only 5'9"" so not like I am crazy tall or anything. Had one of these when I was a kid and really liked it. Clearly the quality has gone way, way down. Don't buy unless you are really short"
1,Piece of junk,First the belt that comes with it thats suppose to hang off your neck is not is way to short. its like they where cutting corners and trying to save money. i had to remove that belt and put another one on. the one they give you is ok if you are 3ft tall haha. the rest of it is just poorly made. the shape of the product doesnt even feel natural. it better to spend the money on a name brand one.
2,uncomfortable.,"I may need to get used to it..so far the position of my arms and the angle on my back that this cause, forced me to use about 25% of the weight that I regulary use. So now I stopped using this device till i figure out the ""proper"" use."
1,writing with little purpose,"This book is the unedited and poorly organized rantings of a man whom, if you met on the dock one afternoon (and he would be easy to spot because, as he claims, he would be wearing $400 logging boots or barefoot) and engaged in conversation, you would quickly tire of his overly opinionated stances on everything and excuse yourself because you've got to get to the hardware store before it closes."
1,don't bother,"this book is written by an arrogant pontificating autocrat with a very rigid narrow world view. The book is full of sarcasm and cynicism but no humor or any real meaningful observations of the human condition. Reads like an essay by a 15 year old petulant self absorbed adolescent, and the editing is the worst I have ever seen in a published manuscript!There is more ridicule than advice. I don't know where all the bitterness comes from but it is tedious.Wouldn't recommend this or anything written by this guy"
1,escaping the self,"I encourage men to read this, only taking into consideration that this book describes just ""the pursuit of a dream"", the reality of the self is only inside your soul. It does not matter where you go, you take your ""self"" wherever you go. And for the sake of the search, it is worth to face and overcome your reality as is and not trying to evade it. It does not even enrich the language. It's poorly written,and edited. Yes, a teenager can have a dream with it!"
3,works great...breaks easy,"This product works great...love the idea of the bag so you don't have to keep scooping and dumping. However, ours broke the first week. The part that allows you to turn the handle just spins and spins so we had to duct tape it to stay put. Would recommend as I'm not sure if it is just the luck of the draw or serious manufacturing problems."
4,HDP5-4 Poop Hound,"Hound Dog Products HDP5-4 Poop HoundThe Poop Hound is well made and fairly easy to use, my wife says ""it's only draw back is that the handle is not long enough"". Myself I found it to be just right, go figure. The shipping of the Poop Hound was very fast even though I was told it would be a week to 10 days before I would recieve the Poop Hound I actually recieved it in three days time."
1,Falls apart!,"I have other products by the same manufacturer and thought this would be great. The attachment to hold the ""catch-bag"" on doesn't stay in place. The bag falls off everytime I try to use it. Junk!"
1,Complaint Resolved,"I bought a poop hound and the implement was great. Unfortunately I lost the little bag holder and was unable to get a replacement from the store I purchased it at or the manufacturer. I tried emailing them, calling them and writing them, I never heard anything back at all. So much for their life time replacement policy. I wouldn't recommend buying an item that the manufacturer doesn't have the courtesy to respond to the customer to try an resolve a problem.Don't know if this review prompted them, but they finally sent me the part I lost. Again, the implement is great I was just not satisfied with their service."
2,"Great concept, poor execution","This product works the way it's described; however, if the bag gets too heavy, which is very quickly, it falls off, and usually into another pile of poop. Also. the edges of the bag that are turned around the bag holder get smeared with poop, so you can't really avoid getting poop on your hands if you try to tie the bag shut."
1,Major design flaws,"Am I allowed to return this thing with poop all over it? For one thing, you have to handle the scooping area to put a new bag on it which, as you can imagine, gets covered in poop. Also, if you have a large dog as I do, the poop is heavy enough to pull off the piece on the back that keeps the bag attached. So on my very first use I had dog doo on my hands. I was not happy. It went straight into the trash. What a waste of money!"
1,worst poop scooper ever,this product is the worst ever. it is extremely difficult to have a clean pickup. It is the worst and most expensive product for poop scooping i ever bought. i would never recommend it.
3,No stooping,"This device is just as good as any other I've used. It does help with not having to bend over to pick up the poop. The bag was a little tough to figure out regarding attaching it to the device. However, because you can use plastic grocery bags, it does offer a way to re-use them."
1,May not be suitable for use by an elderly person,"I purchased this for my father, who is in his 80's. He has trouble bending over to pick up the dog poop. However, the handle is too difficult/hard for him to operate. You might want to consider this before purchasing."
3,The Great Coon Dog,I think the book sounder was a kind of good book. I liked it a little. My favorite part was when Sounder finally barked when his master came from the jail. It was also sad when the boys father went to jail. The pictures were also good. I think the boy was a little brave because he was always looking for his father. The book also made me feel right in the story.
3,The most amazing dog,I didn't like the book because it was sad when the farther had died. I like the book because the dog survied all those shots.It was very emotional.
4,The Poor Dog,"I liked this book cause it was sad. I was exited for the next time we would read. It was sort of boring, but not realy. I liked when the dog survived. I did not like where the dog and the father died because it was sad."
4,Slaves,I really liked it because it taught about what happened when slaves were around. I also liked it because it taught that you may loose something so you shoudnt get and if you do dont give up on finding it or on it coming back. It says in a different way dont let anything come between what you want to learn or find.
4,Sounder,I think that this book is very touching and i feel sorry for the family when that dad get's taken away and when Sounder get's shot. Those two were the family's heart and they can't live without them. I truly loved this book.
3,"This book was sad, yet exciting to read.","This was a required reading for 6th grade. At first I wasn't thrilled about reading it, but after the first chapter, I couldn't put the book down. Some parts were very sad, especially when the guard smashed the boy's hand in the gate. It really made me mad that he was treated so badly because he was black. It was a depressing story, but taught you about reality."
4,Kevin Smith,This is a great book for any young child to read. It tells the classic story about a boy and his dog and the things that they go through together. I would recommend this book to all parents. It is an easy read but not too elementary. Ny child who likes to read would enjoy this book.
2,Sounder is OK,"At first I didn't like the book Sounder at all because it was boring. I just couldn't get into it. Now I liked the book a little better. It is about an African-American boy in the racial early times of America. The boy does not have a great education because the school is far away. So one day his father gets accused of stealing a pig and was sent to jail. When they took the dad away, Sounder, the boy's dog, got shot in the side of the face and shoulder and then he ran away. Later on, the dad gets sent to hard labor and the boy searches for him. Before the boy went to search for his father Sounder came home. The boy sees a quarry and is looking for his dad and the guard throws a a piece of iron at the boys hands. Then the boy gets invited to attend a school and stay at a teachers cabin. Read on to see what happens."
1,SOUNDER,"The book Sounder was an overall boring book, the chapters were atleast 15 pages long each, and what kid is going to want to hear that in school? For this book we had to listen to it on tape in school and just about every day in Language Arts i would prewtty much fall asleep. I personally dont think this book should get a good reveiw."
1,OMG!,"I really cant belive that a lot of you liked this book! It has pretty much no baseline or ""plot"" in the story. It is so boring! I almost didnt read it when I got half way into the third chapter. It is too boring for my interest. A BLAH rating for this book. I could not go to negative 5 satrs. :("
1,Very Boring and Dumb!,this book was not exciting at all! I started to read it because I thought that it was about the dog ON THE FRONT COVER! It was really about some person that gets his dog's ear shot off and he goes tring to find his dad in jail! It was DUMB. Don't ever read it! pretend that you like it or if you buy it yourself than your out of your mind!
5,Amazing,"I am blown away I love it its the best book I've read in a long time, though very sadLove,5th grader"
3,Sounder,"I, over the summer, read a both heartwarming and depressing story about a boy growing up in the harsh south during a time of segregation. He goes through many hard times throughout the course of the story, including when his father gets arrested for stealing to feed his family. His father goes out every night only to come back empty handed. so one day he steals some ham and is put in jail. as they're taking him away Sounder, the family pet, gets shot trying to protect his master. Sounder runs away and eventually dies...this story by William Howard Armstrong made quite an impression on me, and it will do the same for you."
4,Lost dog,Sounder is a dog that lives with a family that is poor . The famaly are African American . The dog go out to hunt for food for the family .

1,"BORING, BORING, BORING!!","This book was absolutly boring! I am an extreme dog lover, so I've read a lot of books. When my friend gave me this book, I was very excited, and was ready to start reading it. When I got around the end of the first chapter, I realized it wasn't at all anything I ever expected. I think this book had a poor beginning, middle and end. It isn't anything you might think it is, and puts you to sleep. But, then again, that is my opinion.Anyway, if someone were to get a really good book, they should buy Stone Fox, Julies Wolf Pack, Old Yeller, or Wild at Heart: Fight for Life."
2,ugh,"Depressing and dull is what i would call it. I felt bad for the poor dog all mangled and everything! And ""the boy"" (who doesnt even have a name) hopes so hard for his dog to come back, and then when he does he complains again saying ""he doesnt bark anymore."" I thought at least the charectors should have names! I guess it did have some hidden meanings and stuff, but it was hard to get interested enough in the book to find them. I give it 2 stars."
2,Like a roller coaster - some parts are good - some parts suc,I had to read Sounder for a novel class. Judging by the cover I knew it will be a boring story and I was right. Some chapters didnt even make sense and it was confusing cuz the characters didnt have names except the dog Sounder. It was pretty boring. Only the end was good.
1,Sounder,I think this book is part good and part bad. It is a very touching story but it has too much inappropriate words in it like s)ex if you take off the sign and there is not enough romance and love!
2,Boring,"This book was about a young boy, whose name you never actually find out, and his dog Sounder. Like most stories about boy's and there dogs, man's best friend ends up dying, but the dying part happens very early along in the book. The rest of the story is the main part of it so I won't give it away.There is hardly any dialogue in the book which makes it exceptionally boring. The author seems to drag the story out and focus a lot on unimportant details. He is a good author, but this definitely isn't one of his strongest stories.The book is a little hard to understand, and hard to keep your attention on. Because of this, I recommend it to anyone who is 13 or older."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!,"I had to read this book for Academic Team, and afterwards I even regretted joining the team it was so horrible. It was so boring. It's supposed to be sad, and I guess the idea is, but I didn't cry at all at the end like I do with well written books such as Stone Fox or something like that. It's so stupid because at the end everything the boy as worked for and found just goes away. What is the point of that? Trust me, if you want to read a classic, read Black Beauty or The Call of the Wild. Don't even touch this book!"
1,this book is boring and long and dramatic.,"It is boring because the boy does not has self-esteem, also in the story there is no interesting.I was obligated to write this."
1,Souder Stinks,"Sounder for me was a very disappointing and depressing book. It was not very descriptive, but it was very sad. For example, a part of the book is ""The piece of iron lay on the inside of the fence. Drops of blood from his fingers dripped down the fence, wire by wire."" You need to be in the mood for a sad story in order to read this book.The people don't show any emotions. If anything bad happens, they don't try to fix it. If something good happens, which is rare, they act like they couldn't care less.[...][...][...]The whole thing was very tragic and had an abrupt ending that had people wanting to know more, like about what happens to the boy when he grows up. The whole story was a fiasco and I would urge you to avoid reading this book."
2,The book is boring.,"Is about a kid that has many problems in his family. Its boring, and it has many unrealistic things that made the book stupid. That is becuase the book doesn't has names of they're characters. It didn't has jockes or action that made a goog book."
4,Sounder,"This book can be enjoyed by children and adults. We highly recommend this book for classroom reading. It is a story about an African American sharecropper family and their dog. Sounder, the family dog, is known for his loyalty and devotion to his master. The boy's father is taken to jail for stealing food for his family. During the event Sounder is shot and disappears, which leaves the reader wondering about the fate of the dog (dead or alive). In the mean time the boy resumes the role of head of the household. Throughout the story the boy searches for his father during non-harvest times. This book leaves you wondering to the very end - Will the dad and Sounder be reunited at last!!"
5,It's the saddest yet the happiest book I ever read,"I liked the book Sounder , because it told the truth about what black peoples lives were like after the Civil War. A father steals a pig so his family can have something good to eat. He is caught and sent to jail . The father's faithful dog Sounder tries to rescue him and get's shot, yet the dog's corpes is no where to be found. When you finish the book,I think you should read the author's note at the beginning . Maybe you'll be able to tell if your tear's are of happiness or sorrow."
1,The mystery dog,"What I liked about Sounder is that the dad came home after he was in jail.I also liked it when Sounder came back home, and everybody was happy.What I didn't like about it is that when Sounder was outside on 3 legs and only had 1 eye and it didn't bark anymore.I think it deserved one star because it was really boring."
4,Sounder,"This childrens book by William Howard Armstrong digs into the life of a young black boy, his father and their dog, Sounder. It is set in the old south and details the struggles of an African American family of this time. The usual struggles for this family are getting food and staying warm until one terriable night that changes the family forever. The father is taken to jail and Sounder is wounded in the struggle. From that night on the boys life is faced with even more struggles to survive, as he is hoisted to the head of the house. He worries about his fathers well being, which sends him onn many adventures looking for him. Through all of the bad the boy does manage to find the good in all occasions.This would be a great read for fourth to eighth grade students. It is a truthful and detailed insight into the history of the African-American race."
4,Sounder and His family,"I think it was a good book.There should be another book about Sounder.About what happened to sounder in the future,and to the boy and his family.The part that was sad for me is when the sheriff shot Sounder.I thought Sounder was going to die."
4,The Great Coondog,Sounder was a very good book.The best part I liked about the bookwas when the father got out of jail and when Sounder came back tothe house.The children and the mother were excited because they had there family back together.The way it was before like when the father and Sounder were not even close to the house. They were far away.The mother and children were probably sad because therefamily was apart.
3,Sounder,"You have to read this book, by William H Armstrong. There are so many corners that you don't know what's going to happen next in the book Sounder. Sounder is a very emotional book. Sounder is the dog in the story and risks his own life for his master.The father gets arrested for stealing ham for his faimly. I really enjoyed certian parts of this book. I recommend this book."
2,The book is boring.,"Is about a kid that has many problems in his family. Its boring, and it has many unrealistic things that made the book stupid. That is becuase the book doesn't has names of they're characters. It didn't has jockes or action that made a good book."
4,Sounder,"Sounder is about a dog and his African American owner. Throught this book Sounder gets badly hurt a number of times. The boy is suffering poverty while his dad is in jail. This book is quite sad, especially when Sounder louses his ear. Towards the end of the story something bad happens!I hope you will enjoy this heart-breaking book as much as I do. Read this book to see how it ends!!!My opnion of this book is that it is a heart breaking book about a wonderful dog. My favorite part is the ending when everythig comes together. I hope you will like this part too!"
4,This was great book,"Sounder was a great book. It is about a african americanfamily that is poor. There father wa barley making the money for foodfor the family. But there father was hailed off to jail and left the famliy to fend for them selfs. While he is in jail he dies and now the family is really screwed. So the son of the family takes the dofg sounder out to hunt to get the food for the family. they do this for a while until some people catch them. They are chased by the guys and sounder get shot by a shotgun. He drags off into the woods and stays there. The boy cant find him so he is stuck at home trying to survive with the fear, anger,pain and sorrow and waiting for somthing good to happen.I am a eighth grader and really dont like to read but this book was one of the best I have read in m life."
5,Sounder,If you like a sad and sorrow this is the book.The story issad because a character gets sent to jail and character getsshot.It is sorrow beause a character look for the characterthat got shot and looking for the other character thats injail.I cannot tell you any more.To find out more go to thelibery or buy the book.
3,Sound Summary,"... I am here to give you a summary of the book Sounder. The book is about a boy, a dog Sounder, and the boys family. The boy is a young, poor, black boy. This boy has many obstacles in his life, including his father going to jail and his dog getting hurt. This book is the kind that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I personally thought that this book was average to high. On a scale of one to five stars, I would give this book three stars. I thought that this book did not have enough action in it. Though this book in not that long, it is very interesting. I hope you read this book."
2,the mighty dog,This was a very sad but good book.I liked it because it had sorrow but yet happiness.But their was some parts I did not like.um...like the part when ... that is sad.But their wassome part I like.Um....also like when the sheriff came that wascool.My favorite person or animal was sounder.It was a good book but not the best.But I will tell my friends to read it for sure.
3,This was a alright book,The book sounder was ok but it was kind of boring. Then there were some exciting parts like when the sheriff shoots the dog and when the guard hits the boys fingers.
4,I liked the book in some ways and didn't like it in others.,The reason I didn't like the book is because it was very sad.The reason I liked the book is because it has more detail than other books! It explains things better than other books! I always thought the book would end up happily but instead it ended up sad.
4,My English class had to read Sounder as an assigned book,I wouldn't give this book a 10 because it was hard to read and nobody had names except the dog {Sounder} I read this in 6th grade and I am still in 6th grade. I also saw the movie Sounder in English and the book was better. I hope you will read this if you are an animal lover and have a box of tissues ready!
4,one of those very few very good books for children,"This book is not just another book about a boy and his dog, but about the larger issues of life and meaning.The Platonic theme of the existence of an higher order of ideas and shapes is one of the nice things about the ending.The black boy comes to grips with a world of prejudice for the blacksouthern share crop farmers. Slavery may have ended in the 1860's, butyou really can't much tell it from this book. Freedom here seems to be the freedom to be mistreated ans starved inside an otherwise rich nation.The poverty here seems to be the color white in the south.One teacher reaches out and helps and shows thatnot all men are liars and cruel?"
5,The Best Book Ever!!,"Sounder is a great book because,''The Boy'' is a poor kid and his dad stole some meat and goes to jail.The dad's dog,Sounder, tries to catch the dad,{because he goes jail} and then Sounder runs away and the boy is always trying to find him.The boy meets someone special along the way........"
5,Sounder,I like this book becase the author explains everthing.I was angry when they took.The boys dad to jail.The author used alot of details to make me feel sorry for them.The boy had to drop out of school to help his parents.The author makes it the book very relistec.It was interesting that the dog was the only one with a name.The author did a wonderful job of making us hate the villins.This book is the best.I ever read.
4,Sounder,"""Chain him up"" said the sheriff, the boy tought he was talking about Sounder, the dog. This is only part of the life the young black boy puts up with. This boy is going through a lot. His dog got shot, his dad got arrested. But on top of that some good things might happen. He might be able to read, a book! But you will never know untill you read this book. Out of a rating of 5 stars, I would give this book 4 stars."
3,The loudest dog in the world,"I kind of like it because it looked cool and looked a little bit iteresting and it sounded like this story was real. It had a little bit of action when the sheriff got to the home and put hand cuffs on his father's hand and took him away and the dog went to try and save him, but one of the sheriffs shot him in the ear and his ear ripped off. That's all that was cool. The boy got sad but some of the stories were kind of exciteing and some were boring."
4,Good pet book,"I liked this book because it is a very good story about Sounder. Sounder is a brave dog and he is an important part of a poor southern family. I liked reading about how sharecroppers lived and survived with little money. I have not read any other pet book like Sounder. I also read the African American story of ""Ruby Bridges Through My Eyes"" and ""Sounder"" is different because it is a book more for boys and ""Ruby Bridges"" is more for girls. The end of ""Sounder"" is sad so the book would not be appropriate for very young children or for a reader with a sick pet. H. Gregory Moore IV"
4,D'ONT READ THIS,"Hi my name is John and I really liked this book.It is 'bout a boy and a dog.There was a sad.....part....I guess.....anyway the boy's dad and dog died in the end, but in the middle the dad stole a ham to feed the family ,and was caught, and put in prison to work in a mine.When the dad came home he had only one leg.I'll stop right there and let you find out the rest on your own."
1,How can people possibley like this book?!?,"I was looking forward to reading this book. It's supposed to be really good, and I'm only read a few books that I don't like. I can read almost anything, but this is the exception. Sounder was horrible and boring. It just dragged on and on and on, with no excitement. Yes, I know what the point is of writing the book, and I think, if it was better written with a better story, it would be a fine book. But it's not, so don't read it. It's a waste of time."
3,Guaranteed to knock your shoes off!,This book is about a boy who has problems. The boy and his father are black.Many of the white people dislike them. One day two big white men barged into their house and kidnapped his father and shot the family dog.When they let their father free he dies. The boy's mother is faced with a challenge as to why the father died. After he died. she failed the challenge. The challenge was to support her family with enough food.
4,SOUNDER,Hi I am here to tell about the book sounder.The book sounder is a great book.The book is about a youg boy whose father go'sto jail and his dog gets shot.This book olny has 116 pages. But when you finsh you will whontto read itagen and agen Becouse it is a good book.This book takes placein the countymost of the time.The reson Ilike this book it's about a dog. second reson is It in the county .the last reson is.The faimly is poor. I reccommendthis book to 5th gradersand up.To find out what happens go to your library and check out Sounder.
4,Sounder; The Great Coon Dog,"The book, SOUNDER,by William Armstrong is very intresting.This is a beautiful book. Thee are some very emotianal parts in this book. I just CAN'T wait to get Sour Land, The Sequel to Sounder!"
2,tear jerker : ( and lethargic,"this book was sooooooo sad! it wasn't very exciting either. i mean, its about a kid w/o a name! no one ever said his name! EVER! if you have to read this book, it's not too hard to read or anything, but if you want a happy, thrilling, exciting book, then this isn't the book for you!"
4,With a few minor modifications...,"Once I finally got it all up and running, this product is great. Even without the booster pump it sends enough cool mist around my front porch. My problem was the end plug ~ it wouldn't stay on, so I had to resort to a brass 1/4'' barb x 1/4'' FIP fitting. Clamped it on with a 1/4'' brass plug and we're good to go for hardly more than 2 more dollars. I was kinda proud of my inginuity being a girl and all. Just made sure the connections were pushed in and screwed on tight so nothing leaked, and it doesn't. Since no one else mentioned the end plug issue, this one may've been defective. You know how Chinese manufacturing can go sometimes. (just kidding ~ especially if you're reading this and you're Chinese.) lol"
3,Not that fantastic,"I have this system set up along my deck railing, so keep it lower so the kids can either run along the deck and cool off or in the garden next to the deck.The little ""plumes"" of mist don't spread very far at all, not more than a foot from each nozzle. You have to be pretty close to it to feel anything at all. It does make a wet patch on the deck flooring.It also attracted a couple of birds who sat on the deck rail, between two nozzles and enjoyed the cooling shower.EDIT: The tubing has cracked and split and broken, its no longer functioning at all. (after 2 years)"
4,keeping cool this summer,"Very happy to have been able to find this product thru amazon,the summer on my terrace should be cooler!"
1,Doesn't really work...,"I own the 6-nozzle misting tower from this company, which works well, but this set doesn't seem to work at all. I hooked it up in accordance with the instructions, turned on the water and.... nothing. The misting tower works fine on the same hose connection, but for some reason, the hose on this kit will fill with water as if it's pressurizing, but it won't start spraying anything until 10 minutes later - and even then, it's not a fine mist, it's little spurts and drips. Buy the 6-nozzle misting tower instead - it's not available on Amazon, but it's much simpler to set up and use."
1,Leaks like a sieve,"I got this and put it together per the instructions, I'm a pretty handy guy so I thought it would work well. WRONG, it leaks like a sieve from every joint. I had to take the whole thing down; I had put it up because I'm a trusting person and silly enough to believe that a new product right out of the box should work. I took it all down but that was easy because the low number of chintzy clips they send aren't very long. I have put Gorilla Glue on all of the joints because that's a product that I can rely on. That should hold but it's too bad that an expensive item like this with about five bucks worth of parts that they sell for $33 should work.One of the small screw-in misters was missing so I sent them an email, that was never anwered. I guess I'll plug that hole with more Gorilla Glue.Caveat Emptor"
5,Clear and informative,I found 'How the US Securities Industry Works' to be an excellent review of the entire securities industry. It explained the industry with more depth and clarity than other books I have read on the same subject. I also found the author's 'Securities Operations Glossary' to be useful.
2,Just Okay,"First of all, did anyone proof read this book? There are typos on almost every page. Also, a thesaurus would have come in handy. If I had to read the words ""Canon"" or ""Pastiche"" one more time I would have had to gouge my eyes out. Also, the pictures are inverted, showing Neil and others playing guitar left handed. The information in this book is interesting, but it's all rehashed from other sources. Skip this one and buy ""Shakey""."
1,Not worth reading at all!,"The author doesn't really know all that much about what he's writing about, and like the other reviewer commented, entire albums and songs are deemed not worthy of exploration. If I had wanted to read critiques of Neil's songs I would have bought a book of critiques. In retrospect buying this book was a mistake anyway because the songs of tell their own stories and part of what makes them so magical is that they are ambiguous. If you listen to Neil Young you know what you like or don't and derive your own meanings from the lyrics that will be much better than this author's lame explanations and ramblings. Do yourself a favor and buyShakey: Neil Young's Biographyif you want some insight. It's an excellent read if you're a fan and gives much better insight to the possible inspiration behind some of the songs."
5,Early BG,If you can't afford to go out and collect all of BGs early recordings this disc is a great buy. I have most of what's on here on my Sunbeam Records collection. The remastering is good. If you like early BG you'll love this set. I particularly enjoy the BG trio playing Clarinetis and That's A Plenty. Living Era is a great company. I have loads of their cds.
4,"Perfect for travelers, ok for the rest of the time",I use this mouse full time and at first it was a pain but now I have gotten used to it and for the most part like it. Its real advantage comes when I have to travel. I do not like the touch pad on my computer and refuse to use it. This mouse takes up such a small amount of space that makes it worth packing.My laptop case has a place for a cell phone and that is usually where I put this. It keeps it safe and I always know where to look for it.My only trouble with this is that the retractable cord sometimes gets all snagged up. It usually only takes a minute or two to fix but it can be frustrating. The retractable cord feature is nice if you have limited space and don't want the cord to get tangled with everyhting.
3,"Nice mouse, if you're a traveller.","I bought this mouse in Canada, right before I flew out of the country. My laptop's touchoad and it's buttons are a little off the mark, and I wanted to be able to use my laptop in the plane back to The Netherlands.At first glance, the mouse is ideal; It's optical, boosts a scrollwheel, and has a retractable cable. Also, it's extremely small, which makes it very easy to store in one's laptop carrying case.However, the small size is also the mouse's disadvantage. I took the mouse to work today, and by now my hand is starting to hurt. I'm afraid that if I'd use this one day-in, day-out, I'll soon be left with RSI.To sum things up: If you have a need for a non-cordless (i.e. in planes), small USB mouse that you will not use for very long periods of time, this is your mouse. For daily use though, I'd recommend getting a bigger version."
4,great mouse with unnecessary feature,"I have been using Kensington pocket mouses for years for desktop as well as laptop. They work great: small, reliable, easy on the hand, good click and roller action. This latest model has the retractable cord. I don't find it useful. It's more in the way than a simple cord would be. But it's a minor thing. Overall an excellent product."
4,Mouse,"This item is a mini mouse. It is small, so it is fragile.As for the vendor, the item did reach us on time and in a timely manner. We would buy from this supplier again."
4,small and simple,"I was never a fan of laptop' touch pad and that is the reason why I purchased this mouse. Like most other people said: its is very small and will require sometime to adjust to. However, once you get use to it, it become very handy.The material was cheap plastic, it look nice and all, but you can tell the quality wasn't there when you hold the mouse. Typical 3 buttons mouse. It does what required, reasonable response time for a mini mouse at this price.The retractable cord does get snagged up occasionally but other than that, the little guy work fine."
1,Kensington Support/Windows 7 Compatibility,"Kensington support is not the greatest. The driver for this product and many others was not available via their website when I checked today due to what appears to be a programming error on the Kensington site.In order to use the Pocket Mouse Mini with Windows 7, Microsoft refers you to the support page for the product. Only problem is the Kensington website doesn't work. So, at least until this is fixed, users can't upgrade unless they have an old installation disk. Or they can, but they just can't use this mouse.Otherwise, I have no complaints with the quality or the concept. I assume the boxed, new mouse comes with a working driver, but beware of support issues down the road."
2,Incomplete!,"Not too pleased that there is no power source (AC adapter) included with the product, or any link to find that power source."
1,"Not happy with product, learned another lesson.","Had I known that this model of glove/boot dryer did not have any type of device to circulate the warm air through the object to be dried I would have never purchased it. I can't see how anyone could design a product like this to work on the principal of natural convection, relying on heat to rise without any forced circulation. It took quite a while to try to dry a pair of gloves (more than a day). It now is one of those things you wished you would not have bought, that is to much of an inconvenience to return, that sits in the box in a closet shelf.Spend more to purchase a model with a forced circulation fan."
1,not what I expected- too much postage to return,The quality of the sound of this is horribleTried to return but postage is too highMade in Pakistan
2,Tambourine Sound,"The tambourine was comfortable to hold, but the sound was very ""tinny"" and was not mellow. I ordered two because two of us would be playing it in a vocal mixed quartet and would be using a microphone. This tambourine would be too high pitched for our purposes."
1,Good game or giant flop?,This is a casino game that isn't worth trying. I've had more fun watching grass grow. The games is dull and slow and the gameplay is identical. I'd reccomend just going online to somewhere like pogo.com to play.
3,I've seen better casino-type games,"This game has realistic casino sounds and some funny dealer interaction, but the graphics aren't spectacular and the gameplay can get a bit dull and mechanical. I have played shareware casino games that offered feedback on your strategy, and I felt those were more fun and more useful, since one of the reasons I would want to play a casino video game is to learn how to win in real life.The main point of this video game seems to be getting you to visit the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas, so a slide-show-style tour of the casino is included in the game. I don't know how effective it is to use a somewhat mediocre game to advertise a casino. It certainly didn't make me more inclined to go there."
1,Never Received The Game!,"I never received the game so it was impossible for me to play it! DeluxDeals has got to be the worst people on here to deal with. Do NOT EVER do buisness with them! After placing the order on December 17th, they say that it sould arrive on or before January 11th. Well, January 11th came and went and NO game! It took over a week to finally get refund from them, but they did refund me. Just think twice before doing buisness with these people!"
1,screens dont fit/poor customer service,"My wife bought this for me for Christmas and haven't been able to use it yet.After putting it together I find out the screens are way too small.I called customer service and they sent me new screens,but the same size as the ones that came with it.Called customer service back and they hung up on us when they didn't understand our problem.Called back and the woman said to turn the base (the part that sits on the ground) upside down.Totally the wrong information and how will that change the size of the screen opening?The instructions are useless and their help very unhelpful.Can anyone help,or do I just take it back and not buy anymore of their products?"
3,Not usable for my needs,"I bought this ""On Clearance"" from Target for their actual list price of $129.99. (I guess I didn't do my homework!) Nonetheless, I was excited to get it assembled only to find out that I can't use it! These cannot be used on a deck as the heat penetrates the bottom of the unit. It doesn't say this anywhere on the box...only on the inside documentation. Bummer for me!"
4,fireplace on deck,Regarding the problem of not being able to use the fireplace on deck... I had a similar problem with my chimnea and I found an asbestos mat at a home store that solved the fire hazzard. Check around or do a google before you give up.
1,shoe rack,I was excited about this product and ordered two. Both were missing instructions as well as critical parts: wood dowels and small screws. I called Amazon and they shipped me two more. These also were missing instructions and parts. Now I might be charged for 4 useless shoe racks
1,wkpmse,"Firt off this is a terrible product. I bought two and both needed replacement parts. The dowels in both units were bowed bigtime. Rather than send for replacements from the manufacturer, which included a address for just this, is an indication all their products need replacing. I bought two actual round ones from the hardware store.I believe the people that designed this product ware childrens size shoes. I ware a 10 1/2 and three pair don't fit on one shelf.You would be better off getting a cheap one piece shoe rack from a discount chain."
3,"Alright, but not worth what I paid.","The shoe rack itself is fine. For forty bucks I thought it would be a bit nicer. I had to make a minor modification with my drill in order for one of the shelves to be level. Probably wouldn't buy it again, but it will work for now."
2,"Fast delivery, parts missing","Seller delivered fast, however parts missing, the wood plugs that holds the piece together was missing, had to go to hardware store to find new ones (seller instruction page said it would be 4-6 weeks for replacements)Product seems OK for the price once assembled."
2,missing 1/3 of the parts!,"I ordered this product because I have one already and like it a lot. But it arrived missing instructions and about 1/3 of the parts. It came with a checklist of missing parts as if they expected this to be a problem. I sent in my form, and I'm still waiting to hear back from the company about those parts."
1,Piece of junk,"Didn't think there was much to screw up with a shoe rack, but the holes were drilled on the wrong sides for one of the shelf pieces and the wooden pegs to hold all the shelves in place were not included. Truly a wast of money and I really wish I would have just driven down the road to the wal-mart and picked one out rather than tried to order one online."
2,An OK shoe stand,"Having purchased the Winsome Wood foldable kitchen cart (which I like and feel was worth what I spent), I was quite disappointed in the quality of this shoe rack. It seems sturdy enough, but not nearly as attractive as the picture, and not worth $40. Even with the lack of instructions, it would not have been terribly difficult to assemble if it had not been missing pieces. The bag with the wooden dowels and the screws for the connectors (for stacking one on top of another) was missing - I hope to have those pieces in 2-4 weeks. Hopefully the wobbliness of the shelves will disappear once the correct sized dowels are in place - I am improvising temporarily because, yes, I am going to keep it for lack of a better option.Also, this shelf will not hold 19 adult shoes - at most 15 when using the floor space underneath.Edit: I did receive the missing parts in about 2 weeks, and it is sturdier now."
2,Winsome Wood Shoe Rack,"If you buy this product you will need more than the hex wrench that is provided. I needed a drill, sander and small phillips screwdriver. The shelving was slightly too long, the holes in the shelving were mismatched and there were no predrilled holes to attach the brackets to hold multiple units together. After I re-manufactured the units, they are sturdy and look nice."
2,Very disappointed,"These shelves were very difficult to assemble, and when finally assembled, they were shaky. I would not buy them again, nor would I recommend them to ANYONE!"
3,"Looks nice, dowels don't fit, get screws","I love the size and style of this shoe rack. The space underneath allows room for a virtual 5th shelf. Its true, like the others wrote, the dowel parts for the shelves do not fit and you'll need to use some long screws of your own, which is a bit inconvenient just when you think its gonna be a cinch to put together, but all in all, its a great finished product for the size, style, and price!"
1,Looks good on the picture..disappointed when saw it in reality,"Does not even come close to the picture. On top of it, it was missing several parts and I had to contact the factory to get those in the mail. Have not received the parts yet, so I cannot put it together. And it was missing the instructions how to put it together. Even $40 is too much for this. If you lower your expectations, might be ok...but not for that price."
3,Won't buy another...,"Because it's stackable and I liked the way it looks, my desire was to get four. But it seemed like it took forever to put together what should have been a 2-minute assembly. The shelves aren't aligned properly and I literally tied one to the frame to hold it in place -- they kept popping up. Honestly, I felt as if I was in an episode of 'I Love Lucy' putting that thing together. I left the tie in place since the weight of my shoes isn't enough to hold it down. I wouldn't trust stacking another on top.The finish is rough, too. It's missing lacquer in many places. It is also splintery along the edges and some of the surface.I'm glad I decided to buy only one to see how it looked instead of buying four. I definitely won't be getting more, at least not this brand."
1,Terrible!,"This is a total waste of money! Very poorly made, the holes didn't even line up where they were suppose to be. I couldn't keep the shelves from falling off. Very frustrating, plus the shipping costs nearly as much as the product. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,Good shoe rack,"Nice, sturdy design. Solid wood construction as well. Can be folded and shelves removed. It goes together pretty easy if you can understand the hieroglyphics. (Instructions)"
4,Understanding the tension in Saoudi Arabia,"This book offers a unique glimpse into the two forces that are trying to dominate Saoudi-Arabian society: the islamic legal scholars (ulama) and the royal Saud family. At the moment the ulama seem to be winning this battle, which leads to the implementation of strict islamic Hanbali law in almost all spheres of everyday life. The striving of the king to implement more westernized laws is largely ignored by the ulama and the islamic judges. All this makes the Saoudi-arabian islamic system of law an ideal subject for studying and understanding Islam. The book is fairly easy reading, although I would say that some preliminary knowledge about Islam is required."
1,Buyer Beware!!Worst customer service I have ever had:(,My order was shipped to the wrong address I contact the seller several times to try and fix the problem and they were rude and refused to do anything to help address or fix the problem. I am now in the process of filing a claim with amazon to hopefully get the money back as it was a birthday present and get the perfume from another seller. I recommend buying from anyone else!
3,"Good, but hard to control","This is my first review, so here it is. The game is fun and all, and one cool thing is that you can finally fly a bomber. But, it is very hard to control, for example, when I want to go down, i go down but it takes 4 seconds for it to work. Overall, good game but hard to control."
3,I wish I could give it more stars,"Beauty is in the eye- etc. etc., but I've got to say I'm a bit amazed at all the 5 star reviews here. I think I have about every mst3k since the first year and have watched many of them multiple times. I don't think this piece is in the same league. Mike is good, the others ok, but the whole format is disruptive and irritating. And something about the robots always allowed them to be extremely critical without coming across as nasty, an advantage they lose here. This is passable entertainment, and I'm not saying don't waste your money if you are totally jonesing for some new mst3k- but it's going to be about equivalent to giving the Marlboro man a nicotine patch."
3,"MST3K guys, but slightly different","These three guys rip on a movie. A boring, horrible movie that hates humanity. The commentary was funny, but I am pretty sure that this movie is actually a demon whose purpose is to make people hate. I also preferred the other two films done by the Film Crew, the cast seemed to be having more fun."
4,Great!...but try Cinematic Titanic as well!!,"The output is great if not stellar, but to be fair, you can't separate the talents that were writing the original scripts for Joel/Mike and the bots without losing some of the shizzle...I've purchased the other DVDs by this group as well as most of the MST3K boxed sets to replace my aging library of comedy central and SciFi channel recordings. They are like my children now..all equally loved but for different reasons...If you haven't tried it yet,Cinematic Titanic is where Joel, TV's Frank, Trace, Pearl, and J. Elvis went to keep the genre going...they are also doing live shows around the country and it is a lot of fun...I saw them in Cleveland with my 17 year old who has now fallen for the MST3K curse..."
4,The laughs are back!,"Watching this made me remember how much I missed the old MSTKs! This was definitely a treat, watching (or rather listening to) Nelson and the rest of the gang making fun of a cheesy stripper movie was the highlight of Christmas. It was an added bonus when I realized that this was NOT the kind of movie which would have made the old TV show. I mean, one of the Golden Girls taking her clothes off? Some of the jokes wouldn't have made it on TV either."
2,Sub-par outing from folks who can do better,"After MST3K, Mike Nelson and company needed something to do. And after 10 years of a steady Mystery Science Paycheck, they needed something to put food on the table as well. Their first post-MST3K foray, the Film Crew movies, are unfortunately just a limp, not-terribly-funny retreat of the MST3K concept. The host segments are downright painful to watch. OK, it's fun to see what Brain Guy looks like sans makeup, but their hearts just aren't in the host segments. When they get into the movie, you can imagine that it's Mike and the bots, what with the voices and all. But this movie is such a stinkbomb that even a MST3K-lite treatment can't keep you from pressing ""info"" repeatedly to see how much of the hour and 18 minute running time is left. Unless you are desperate for more MST3K at all costs, avoid. If you can't stay away, rent this rather than buying it."
2,MST junkie,"The film crew, at least gives MST lovers an extra couple movies to watch. The movie is scary bad, which does make it hard to watch even with The Crew making fun of it.Look at other film crew movies before this one."
2,Okay,"I am a huge MST fan, and found both Film Crew movies rather disappointing. For one thing, they repeat many of the riffs from MST movies. And, the humor is much more sophomoric and occasionally, rather tasteless. Not to say I didn't laugh--I did--but they're rather uneven and not nearly the caliber of some of the better MSTs."
4,Just as funny as any Mike era MST3K,"So good to have new material from the old MST3K group as the Film Crew. The movie was a bit harsh, and I cannot show it to my kids, but I liked it a lot!A mild pain because the movie was so ""out there"". Just seeing it made me dizzy with confusion, or nausea--I'm not sure which."
4,Mike & Friends are back!,"Great fun and a bit o' naughty humor in this hilarious movie 'review'. Mike & 'the Bots"" are more grown up and very funny in this returnto the small screen. The 'breaks' in the movie commentary aren't as smooth as on the Satellite of Love, but the viewer can tell these guys are still having fun.Buy this!"
2,Nearly Unwatchable,"Yes, I loved MST3K and was very happy to see Mike and pals back on the job... but the film at hand is so dull that it provides little fodder for comic commentary. There's bad, good-bad and awful... this film is just awful, and was a poor choice to help launch a potential franchise. Honestly, I could not sit through it. I am looking forward to ""Killers From Space"" which is an amusing bad film on its own merits, and should provide ample opportunities for the comic spin that Mike and company are capable of providing."
5,What a fun book!,"This exciting board book is a great combination of action, humor and learning. All the illustrations are full of movement. The words interact with the animals, demonstrating concepts for small children and providing extra visual interestfor all. It introduces animals (all labeled for easy identification) beyond the usual cow and pig, making learning fun, and the last page brings them all together in an ending that is sure to inspire a fit of the giggles. This one's a winner!"
3,A little boring,"On its own, I find this book to be boring. Each page shows a desert animal (the illustrations are lovely), with its name in small print, and a short sentence. ""I howl, I growl. I chase, I race. I nest, I rest..."" that sort of thing. Just reading the book proves to be very boring for me as a parent, and my toddler isn't all that interested either. We've made it fun by adding hand motions and sounds to go along with the verb. Because of the potential for this interaction between parent and child, I've deemed the book to be ""OK,"" resulting in 3 stars. Otherwise, it's boring enough that I would have rated it lower."
5,"excellent, and funny","This wonderful book introduces children to the wildlife of the desert. It has nice illustrations of different types of animals, with two word statements (one of them I) representing animal noises or actions. It also has a very funny punch line. My son memorized this book when he was three, and now reads it to his younger siblings. They love it as much as he does. This is an excellent pick for pre and new readers."
5,Botanical Latin - even the title sounds scary,"I was given this book by a 'fellow plant person' as a helpful hand through grad 'skool'. I truly wish I'd had known about this book years ago when I starting to ID plants, lichens and mosses!! It would have made the process of learning a new language less intimidating! Knowing the definition of a root word is so important and applicable in areas outside of botany. - Knowing the meaning of a root word has been helpful to my English as a second langauge students. Don't let the word 'Latin' scare ya, this book is the dictionary. It is a tool not a great story unless you're into the development and history of language. It has come to be a great reference book, even my grad advisor is interested in it."
3,Useful book for Botanists,"This book is very useful for professional botanists. I see that any teacher or professor in botany field need this book,and I recommende this book to any University library"
5,Hilarious - and I AM a Goth!,"Oh my. I love MST3k so Mike Nelson's acerbic humor is pretty beloved. The vintage (often high 60 & 70s) graphics are charming and the wit is there. The Pop ink series is pretty consistent in terms of both satire and image quality and I honestly found this terrific.A word to the wise; it really isn't about goths per se. It's mostly classic Mike Nelson rants about Halloween-type things (Frankenstein, Haunted Houses, etc.)If you're looking for a more 'Goth' specific send up, check out Voltaire's ""What Is Goth?"". Fun and written by an actual scenester...However, if you love vintage halloween and a good laugh, this is great!"
4,Great Old Monster Kid Graphics with Funny Text,"Some of the graphic elements here have been MIA for a long time. It's great to see them resurrected and accompanied by some silly text. The humor in the text really grew on me once I realized what to expect. I guess you'd hate it if you were expecting quotes from a Chekhov play. Yes, it's hipsterish and goofy, but it's a great pick me up when the rest of the world is telling you that skeletons and vampires only matter in October."
2,Bland and uninteresting,This is essentially Pop Ink graphics that have been altered to look 'gothy' with the pithy and boring comments of Michael J Nelson of MST3K fame. I like Nelson - but this is not his best medium.
2,"Can one complain about ""bad"" kitsch?","It may sound odd--I was indeed looking for kitsch, but this turned out to be _bad_ kitsch, if that even makes sense. It looks cheap and kindergarten-ish, not lurid or ambivalent. It's empty, no buzz. The images remind one of bad wrapping paper or greeting cards--not billboards or packages or advertising, the sort of thing I had in mind. Well, it might be your sort of thing, but it wasn't what I was looking for."
4,Magicians of Gor,This Book arrived earlier than expected and as described.Easy business transaction and willing to do business again in the future.
5,great product and hot price!,This is a very nice heater comes on and off when you need it the same heater is on QVC for $20 more in price i would recommend this to a friend i might even get another.
5,Lamplight Farms Torch Stand,Wow! I really was impressed with the quality of this product. Could not be happier. I was a little hesitant to buy because the price was so reasonable I thought they would be worthless but I was wrong they should last me for years to come.
3,Eventually worked,"It was easy to install. The only thing was that for the front doors (on both sides), when I rolled up the window it got stuck near the front when it hit the ventshade. I kept having to push the ventshade in with my finger to allow the window to go all the way up. I used a little glue to hold it in place better and left the window closed for a few days. Now it's no problem."
1,Poor Binding,"The story is wonderful, but the binding is horrid. Do NOT buy Quiet Vision Publishing versions of the G.A. Henty books. The print on the cover is poor quality and even digitized. The spine of the book and back cover was already detached from the rest of the book as I pulled the book out of the box. I'm sure the pages will end up breaking apart and falling out. The margins are also dreadful. Wish I would have spent a little more and ordered a nice hardcover from another place."
5,Fifa '99 - best soccer game of the year,"Ok, If you are a soccer fan, this is the game for you. The N64 version of Fifa '99 is the best soccer game I have ever played. It looks just like real life. My friends and I sit there for hours playing Fifa. This game tops off any other soccer game made. This is definitely a great buy."
5,nls is the best,Best fish food ive ever used. Theyre always begging at the top of the tank when i come into the room. Also have really colored up since i started using this food. I feed this and omega one food they are both really good for cichlids
4,Works as advertised!,"We were quite pleased with the performance of the Terk antenna. It rivaledthat of the amplified antenna on our RV. Even though we get local channelsfrom Direct TV, it is really nice to be able to view them in HD."
2,Does not support Dual LNB dishes as described,"This only supports triple-LNB Directv dishes. I have a dual and triple LNB dish for my Directv and I wanted to put this on my dual LNB dish. However this is too big, it will not fit on the smaller dish. It will only fit on my larger triple LNB dish (which doesn't work for me). I did just do a quick test on it though to see how it picked up the reception and it worked pretty well. Got all my locals in with no major problem and even got a station from about 60-70 miles away that is not in my local area. So if you are putting this on a triple LNB system go for it. if you are trying to put this on a dual LNB (like the description says), then you need to look for a different one."
4,Not Bad,"It wasn't too hard to install if you have easy access to your dish. I live northwest of Denver. A couple of analog channels, 4 and 12, are a little statics but still viewable. The only HD channels I can get are, 2, 12, and 31. The HD channels are very clear. But only a few of the programs are broadcast in 1080i and 720P. It still a lot better than analog. The sounds from the HD channels are CD quality. I think they are still working on HD antenna tower for the other HD channels in Denver. The tower should be finish by middle of 2008. And hopefully, I will be able to get the rest of the HD channels."
4,Works Great!,This thing works great. My neighbor has one and it picks up 5 more channels that he was able to get with his indoor rabbit ears.
1,poor reception,"Ok, I live in an urban area. I only got 2 channels with this thing. My indoor rabbit ears pick up 9 channels. What a waste of money and time. Shouldve done my research first and found out that any ""dipole"" antenna is worthless."
4,Antenna Recommended,I was surprised how good this antenna worked considering I live in a rural area with television stations over 100 miles away. I assume that the 14 HD channels I pick up now are due to local transmitter towers. It also brought in quiet a few analog stations clearly. I would recommend it as a good antenna for over the air reception where a larger antenna is not feasible.
3,HD problem,"Antenna works great on local stations and the range was surprising. However, it cutout the HD portion of the signals. Seems I could have local channels or HD but not both. DirecTV. Still experimenting."
1,The antenna is NOT compatible with all mini-dish systems,"The Terk 44 does not work with Dish 1000 satellite dishes. After installing, I found out the hard way that this dish does not work with my ATT Dish Network HD DVR system. The description states that ""The antenna is compatible with all mini-dish systems"". This is NOT true. This might work for your system, but check to see if your dish is a Dish 1000 first."
2,"Not as ugly as rabbit ears, but no better reception","I have an older 18"" dish and I think this is meant for a dish this size. I tried this clip-on for a few months before giving up on it. The problem (I think) is you are limited by not being able to turn the satellite dish towards the local TV stations' antennas for the best reception. Most of the local channels I watch have their antennas about 20 miles from me. I ended up ordering an RCA passive indoor antennaRCA ANT1500 Superior Flat Antenna (White)and installing it with duct tape in the rafters in my garage (I added a coax cable extender and ran it through the hole in my wall along with the satellite's coax cable). I'm able to get 26+ channels with the RCA antenna mounted up high."
1,Maybe I hooked it up wrong but...,Maybe I hooked it up wrong but a set of regular bunny ear antennas work much better than this device. I figured the antenna being outside would improve over the air reception but I could only get maybe 1 or two stations while the bunny ears would recieve several.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ITEM!,"I purchased this item as it claimed that the installation was easy and good reception and HD capabilities given that we are well within the 5 miles from transmission towers.Well, the reception was so poor that a coat hanger works better. Also, the installtion was difficult as I needed to pry the item on to my dish, then pry it back off to remove the darn thing.This item does not even warrant a 1 star as -5 stars would be the appropriate rating."
1,Terk Tv44,Terk Tv44 does not work and we wasted our money on it. We tried everything even to call the techs and that did not help. The techs told us to send it back and they would replace it which we did but still no luck. We had to pay for the shipping to get it here and then to send it back so we have been out alot of money for nothing.
1,Incompatible with single receiver systems,"Nowhere in the description or packaging does it say that this antenna requires a satellite multiswitch. A multiswitch is used for systems using more than 1 TV/receiver. The antenna amplification comes from the satellite multiswitch, and without amplification, this antenna is no better than a pair of simple rabbit ears.This antenna may work great for those with multi-room satellite setups, but it was worthless for me."
1,pay attention to technology,I have a dishnetwork 942 HDTV DVR system. This antenna is designed for a much older system. It doesn't fit the dish very easily and was difficult to secure. I can't tell if it works because so far it just seems to be incompatible with my system.
1,Not worth buying.,I spent at least 1 hour trying to adjust the antenna to bring in local stations which are only 5 miles away. Could get UHF but was unable to get the VHF stations to come in with enough power to view. Very disappointing antenna. I got better results with rabbit ears.
2,Please just use rabbit ears.,I've had this for a while now. It says it will work with multiple TV's. It doesn't. Only a few local channels can be tuned. The amplifier built in isn't strong enough and the installation is complex.
3,havent used it yet,"this stuff is so vague on the instructions good luck figuring it out!!Give it 1 week of use 3 to 4 weeks before flowering.Doesnt say how many doses in a week,or how much you put in a gallon!!They claim on the bottle they have a help line,its a recording,that no one will call you back.On the website it says .1292 per gallon.If you know how much that is,you better at math then me."
2,De Aki a Ketama,"I purchased this CD because I love flamenco and I read the glowing reviews by other buyers. Unfortunately, this CD doesn't do anything for me. It's basically Spanish pop that, occasionally, vaguely refers to flamenco. A waste of money for me, sadly."
3,... Okay,"This pen isn't Waterman! This is a Parker ballpoint pen! I wanted the Waterman one! Buying from eBay now, instead."
1,Motorcycle Gran Turismo?,"I'm afraid my experience with this title was NOT a pleasant one. I went through 3 copies of this and all were plagued with bugs. Not sure if it was a bad batch or what. The analog controller would not work with this game and the graphics were slow and choppy. Plus, each track has a section or two where EVERY time you get there, the whole game slowed to a crawl. I ride a sportbike and tried my best to enjoy this game. But, the slowdown, glitches, spotty graphics and lack of analog was too much and I finally had to return it. I hope you fair better, this title held a lot of promise."
1,Ouch!,"I cannot believe Honda AND EA Sports actually lent their names to this excuse for a motorcycle race simulator. I remember playing a little known game for the Sega Genesis titled Kawasaki Super Bike that blew this one out of the water- nearly 8 years ago! The graphics are poor, the play is choppy and hard to control. I can walk faster than these bikes can corner, and the handling all around stinks. Stay far, far, FAR away from this game."
1,get out while you can,"Don't even consider this game. The graphics are horrible, the bikes do not react as if they have handlebars (meaning they don't turn unless you are going under 30 mph). This game seems more like an after-thought. Do not play! get away from the evil that is this game."
4,Castrol Honda Superbike Racing,"It's the Gran Turismo of motorcycle racing. Real tracks, about 6 skill levels, and realistic physics."
4,"Good stuff, although less than 2nd Edition","This book, and its vol2 (More effective C++) is a must have for any intermediate level C++ practitioner.Unfortunately, the new material comes across as muddled, perhaps because C++ is now so complex that maybe even Dr Meyers doesn't quite get it? Who knowns.Whatever the reason, this volume is markedly more muddled and therefore less impactful than its previous editions. But it is still an essential tome, hence the 4 stars."
3,"Book Fine, Kindle on iPad Formatting is Bad","Classic book, but the paragraphs have no indentations on the Kindle version (at least in the iPad) and the line spacing between paragraphs is the same between and within paragraphs making it all look jumbled together and unprofessional. Other books I've gotten on the iPad look fine."
4,Very didactic,"This is the type of book I recommend to everyone with little experience in C++ and willing to become a better and more experienced coder.The author talks about several items which are useful for dealing with class hierarchies, design, good coding practices and solution to usual problems (and also shows some problems dont have a simple solution).The way he writes makes it very easy for every coder to understand even for non native english readers. Sometimes you feel like going to the PC to implement what hes talking about and see the magic of C++ come alive.Great book."
5,Must read book,"Great book, can't wait for the fourth edition. I've read the other two editions and the coding / explanation gets better and better everytime."
4,Must Read != Must follow,"Anyway, it is a very good book for an intermediate newbie in C++, especially if you are looking for a C++ coder position. :)It opens your eyes on C++. But before reading it, you need to open your mind. ""If you trust in it at all, you may prefer not at all."""
2,Good but too expensive ( Thinking in C++),"People who say this book is great, are those who haven't read or heard of "" Thinking in C++ "" by Bruce Eckel. There are two volumes in that book I and II. I will say Effective C++ is a good book, but definitely not worth its price. Thinking in C++ is free ( can't believe it ). Download it for yourself and read both volumes. If you really want to spend money, they I would suggest "" More Effective C++: 35 New ways "" is something you should buy. That's exactly what I did. I have both volumes of Thinking in C++ and the 35 new ways book. That serves the purpose. You will thank me later on. I have over 5 years of experience in C++ with a BS, MS in Computer Science. Once again go download Thinking in C++.I loved it."
5,A Must Have for ALL C++ Developers,One of my favorite books. It has so many hit home points about great C++ programming that if you code in C++ it should be mandatory for you to read this.
5,Yet Another Must Own C++ Title!,"This Book should be on every C++ programmers shelfi think no matter who you are or what level of experience you havethis book will teach regardless.this book seems to be mainly about taking what you know and giving it an in-depth boost, i guess you could say the title says it all."
4,Better quality than another we purchased,I like this product. We purchased a similar product at a local pool supply company and it broke apart within a week or so. This one held together with lots of play. You need to move the foam floaties into just the right position so it stands straight. Good product.
1,chinsey,Bought this for my teenagers....very chinsey..falls apart about every time its touched and the ball wont even go thru the basket unless u are right beside it and slam dunk..at which time the poles break loose.....dint buy it get a bigger better one!
5,New focus on material science,"The text shows an excelent review of materials science fundaments and their relationship with history and current applications including conventional and new materials used in modern applications such as electronic and medicine. Problems with answers are also included. It is hard to find similar books about this subject that interestingly show historical aspects in conjuntion with basic aspects of materials.Expert readers can probably find some topics too basic . However, the aim of the author seems to be to invite materials science beginners to be in touch with this fascinating world (such as students and young scientists and engineers). Academics can also find in this book useful information to support introductory courses and seminars concerning materials science and engineering.I hope that Prof. Hummel can enlarge some contents in future editions adding still more historical aspects. Nevertheless, my congratulations to Prof. Hummel on the second edition."
2,a good guide headed south,"I just got back from a month in Mexico. The book was probably quite impressive back in the early 90's. However, many of the hotels and restaurants listed in the book have gotten so much business that they have lost what good attributes they originally had. Also, many of the prices quoted in the book were way off. The book prices were frequently one-half what the concierge or waiter quoted. The peso has not changed enough for a 5 dollar hotel room to become 12 or 15. Perhaps that is the risk one finds with any guidebook.Museum hours were consistently incorrect, especially for Mondays, weekends and evenings.This book might keep you out of trouble, but it is not the guide for a budget traveler."
2,"Some useful info, some not","Although generally a fair travel guide, the book is incomplete in some areas. As a resident of Mexico, I found lonely planet often does not contain the places which are the best values in each of the cities listed. However, I prefer it that way, since many of Lonely Planet's listings feel they can suddenly increase prices. Although some out of the way places are listed, not many of them, and we have Lonely Planet to thank for destroying such sanctuaries."
5,The Truth about Bird Flu,"This is an excellent book - a thorough systematic and well researched book which documents the REAL reasons for birds and people to be dying of 'bird 'flu'namely toxic residues of pesticides and herbicides including those persisiting form the agent orange bombings in vietnam, the appalling, cruel and inhumanely toxic conditions in which poultry are factory famed and the vested interests behind decimation of the traditional family poultry breeders and the pushing of a useless and dangerous vaccine. It includes what you really need to know to be healthy which is the only real immunity.An excellent read, I couldn't stop turning the pages"
4,Beat the Swine Flu Hype!!,"Comprises a very decent examination of the facts surrounding the swine flu ""pandemic."" And, the government and media created hysteria. It also examines the very real dangers of the vaccine. Want the real story? Get this book PRONTO!! There are a few minor errors here and there, but don't let this discourage you. Our swine flu study group has been using this as our textbook. There was no pandemic in 1976, and there is no pandemic in 2009! PURE PROPAGANDA!!Feel free to dialog about this. [...]"
3,My Only Concern about this is...........,"That I ordered the EDP and I was given another EDT!!!! I assumed it was what was stated EDP but when I got out my loop, sure enough it was not SO CHECK YOUR BOTTLE WHEN YOU GET IT!!!!!!!"
5,Luv it,this is my winter fragrance it is hard o find in the stores i stated wearing this in the late eightie. so glad i can get it on the internet. this fragrance stay with u all day and u get compliments all the time.
5,Haunting And Memorable,"This is a haunting story of a young inner city girl who faces the loss of her mother, which will leave her a penniless orphan. In an heartbreaking attempt to leave a final tribute to the mother she loved and lost, she sacrifices everything and sets out on the road alone to face her sorrow and uncertain future. The characters are complex and believable, the subplots are heartwrenching, and the ending is inspiring. The scenery is vivid and you will find yourself feeling the cold and desolation described within the pages. The plot is well thought out and ties up all loose ends in the final chapter.Well written and memorable. Highly recommended."
4,"A steal, at the price.","Its not a dual shock, but the value is shocking. Mine is blue, with a non-slip grip. Its a little smaller then a standard dual-shock, but has a nice circular d-pad. Excellent for fighters."
2,do not buy this product based on the photo,"The picture on amazon.com is misleading. What you think is N64 controller for the PS1 is really no different than a regular PS1 controller.... no middle handle ,no trigger, no thumbstick, no dual shock. if you want another PS1 controller this is fine for the price."
1,Watch out,"when i recieved this item, i realized that it did not have the joystick in the middle as it shows. So if you are ordering this item strictly because of the joystick, find a different product."
2,beware,beware of this controller it doesn't look like that in the picture. It looks like an ordianrry ps1 controller
3,Used to be a good deal,"Okay, this set used to be an awesome deal. However, amazon droped the price of the original individual boxsets and forgot to adjust this price as well. Here are the prices:Season 1 19.97Season 2 24.97Season 3 24.97Season 4 24.97Season 5 26.67_______________Total 121.85This is a difference of 20.30. So right now, it is better to get each box set on it's own. Hopefully amazon will correct this and price these sets around a 100 bucks. That would be tasty.ZachEdit: Apparently Amazon saw thier mistake and rather than lowering this price, they uped the price of all of the other seasons back up to where they were. Poor show amazon. Very poor show."
4,great present for the uber simpson geeks out there,"you know how you are. what's maggies middle name. how many eyes did the radioactive fish have. whats your favourite halloween episode.the past couple of seasons have stunk, imho. the first 5 are the best. when homer was mean and the drawing stunk."
5,"YES, YES, YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",This has to be the greatest collection of DvD's ever. I must say this exceeded my expectations. The first 8 were the best seasons and now you can own 1-5 together. I suggest you buy this package at Costco where it is only $75.00 (yes $75.00). Buy this now!!!!
2,Great Band...Poor Video,"When I bought this, I expected some great concert footage as well as other videos. All there is is grainy second rate camcorder footage with the sabotage video and a few extras. I wouldn't buy this unless you're a big Beastie fan."
4,Hardcore fans will find this worth owning,"With the release of the Criterion double DVD, a lot of the videos on this become obsolete. One of the greatest treats of owning this video long ago was ""Futterman's Rule,"" which compiled outtakes of the ""Sabotage"" video; now that you can see the Sabotage video from several different takes on the Criterion CD, this seems kind of pointless. But it isn't ENTIRELY pointless - after all, it is a video for ""Futterman's Rule,"" which isn't on the Criterion collection. And that's pretty much the case for this whole DVD - it's full of some of the Beasties best unseen (read: not actually their best) videos and some songs that fans of their radio work will never have heard. And which aren't available on the Criterion DVD at all. For that reason, it's worth having not only as a video collection but as a good compilation of quality Beastie Boys music."
2,Don't bother,"This collection is pitiful, especially in light of a new dvd being planned by Criterion which will include all their videos and remixes in definitive form. Don't believe it?"
2,NOT A VALUE,"OTHER THEN A COUPLE AWESOME SONGS, LIKE SABATOGE OF COURSE, I WOULD HAVE TO NAME THIS ALBUM THE WORST OF THE BEASTIE BOYS. I JUST DON'T THINK THIS ALBUM OFFERS THAT MANY GOOD SONGS. ON THE PLUS SIDE IT DOES HAVE THE MUSIC VIDEO OF SABATOGE AND PRETTY GOOD SOUND."
4,Excellent book for the intermediate shotgunner.,"Bruce Bowlen's book is clearly written and well illustrated. I am confident it helped my techniques and success on recent Pheasant and Quail shoots. It may also help skeet shooters. It will help anyone ""fit"" a shotgun and mount it better."
3,Great Product...only 1 problem,"I recieved this product and it appeared to be in great condition. As I blew it up, we noticed a small pin hole in the base. My husband patched it, and it seemed to be fine. The next morning the entire house was completely deflated. I was so upset because this item is not longer carried anywhere. It is hard to find. My toddler really loved it and I was happy with the product otherwise. I would give it five stars except for the fact that we got a brand new item already damaged. The size is great for older babies and toddlers and it is bright and colorful and carries that great Little Tikes image. I was just upset we had to send it back already for a refund."
2,DON'T BUY FROM THIS DEALER,I AM STILL WAITING FOR THIS ITEM TO BE DELIVERED TO ME. I ORDERED IT ON 12/26/2009 AND I AM STILL WAITING AS OF 01/28/2010.
5,highly recommend,"YAH College Internet Guide is fantastic! Parents, buy it for your kidin college - they'll love it. Students, get one -- you'll find a siteyou really needed to know about."
2,Very disappointing,"Every once in a while on the light music radio stations, you hear a song by Linda Eder, and say ""who the heck is that?"" Amazing voice, but still a little known artist. I decided to explore Linda Eder and buy her CDs. This first one was very disappointing, I don't think she had truly come into her own yet. Her later music is much better. The voice is amazing, I don't know why she isn't a bigger star. But stick with her last couple of CDs; the first was just a warm-up."
2,I love Linda but buy her other albums!,"I am a huge Linda Eder fan but this album is her first and they were trying to make her album sound like Whitney Houston or Celine Dion. The arrangments sound dated and are kind of embarassing BUT her voice is awesome - as usual.If you are a die hard Linda fan you must have this for your collection. Otherwise If you want a great Linda Eder album buy ""it's time"" ""It's no secret anymore"" or her awesome Christmas album.If you are buying this for ""Someone like you"" - it is available on one of the other albums with a better arrangement.LINDA RULES!"
3,A mediocre first album for a soon-to-be great singer,"After listening to her later albums, this collection is a BIG disappointment. It's apparent that she had not found her style yet when this was released, and the songs make her sound like just another girl pop singer performing for teenagers. If you would like a female Barry Manilow, then this album is for you. I still give this album 3 stars because there are a few moments where hints of her talent show up; and even mediocre material sung by Linda Eder still offers some enjoyment. But definitely buy her later albums first, particularly the spectacular 'It's Time' and 'And So Much More'."
2,"Buy ""Every Little Thing"" With Linda Eder BUT THIS","I am honestly not ashamed to say that I am close to being this woman's number one fan. I own every album and cast recording she is on. She is truly the voice of a generation, but not on this album. The songs don't fit her talent at all. But give her a break...Its her first album right?I would highly recommend ""Its Time"" and ""Christmas Stays the Same"" to add to your collection."
5,Better than it's given credit for,"I have read over many of the reviews for this album, most of them don't give it a high rating, and before I owned this wonderful album I was skeptical because of the reviews I had read. Well, I eventually decided to take a chance on it, being a huge Linda Eder fan, and I can say honestly that I loved it. It may not be quite the style of her later albums, but it is still a great CD and it stands well on its own. My favorite songs from the album are 'Rescue Me' which is more upbeat and does sound like something I could hear Celine Dion performing, and 'After All', which reminds me of her song 'Even Now' from her 'It's No Secret Anymore' album. It is true, her style may have matured over time, but this album is still a gem and is worth checking out."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,THIS CD APPEARS TO BE AN ILL ADVISED COLLECTION OF REJECTS FROM AN EARKIER RECORDING SESSION PLUS A COUPLE OF REISSUES OF CUTS FROM PREVIOUSLY RELEASED CD. LACKS ORIGINALITY AND IS FAR FROM EDER'S USUAL QUALITY. THIS IS NOT A RELEASE SHE WILL BE PROUD OF.
2,Poor Linda!,"I'm listening to the Linda Eder CD called, well, ""Linda Eder."" It's strictly Frank Wildhorn music I believe. I feel so sorry for Linda. This stuff is utter dreck. Blech.A pretty terrific singer and an okay production budget and this is the best he can do for his wife? No wonder they broke up."
3,not the same as for 10 ears ago,"When Linda Eder started, she sound allmost like Barbara Streisend,but with her own sound.Maybe within enother 10 years, her voice will get stronger. Her timing is very good, now Linda wan`ts to increase her volume. And its not all COMMERCE, or is it? Otherwise her voice is much better than the average singer. Much better. In the Netherland we have a saying "" 13 in a dozen "" Most of the performers are the same. But not Linda Eder. Tell Linda to increase her voice, then she will be even better than Barbara Streisand.You can`t say anymore about Linda.Linda keep on singing. Sjoerd Walda of the Netherlands."
5,"Great voice, great charisma","I heard Brandon and the guys at Legends Corner bar in downtown Nashville. What a great place to drop in, a cool Honky Tonk bar with a real ""Honky Tonkin'"" kind of guy. Right place, right time for me! The band was incredible and I think this album is a great combination of country rock and traditional country. Brandon's voice seems to do either very well. A MUST for country fans."
5,Great Book,"A must-read for all intercessors. It inspires one to persevere in praying, particularly for awakening. Asmall and easy-to-read book."
1,Starts out great . . . but proves the opposite conclusion.,"Paul Copan starts out with a very logical, persuasive essay showing that it is the agnostic humanists who control our society are the real narrow minded bigots. Some of the arguments are excellent and valuable in deflating the superiority status of this group.By about page 80, however, Copan turns his cannons on Mormons, Jehovah Witnesses and other non-traditional mainline Christian groups.By the end of the group, he has excluded everyone from Christendom who doesn't share his narrow, fundamentalist viewpoint, essentially proving the conclusion which he set out to disprove.Very unfortunate that Copan feels Christians can still afford the luxury of fighting each other rather than putting their differences aside and pulling ranks together against the agnostic, humanistic establishment who threatens ALL Christians-- Catholics, JWs and Mormons included."
1,Ignore the High Raters- They've Got an Axe to Grind...,"Anybody who only claims to deal in ""absolutes"" is either ignorant or a fraud.Consider one simple example. ""Absolutes"" would dictate, that since Jesus said to give to anyone who asks, and to be perfect that therefore, I am entitled to ask any fundie to give me all their money.Of course they won't- because of the internal inconsistencies in such thinking. And, few- especially those of the fundie stripe- will admit they're wrong; they'll say you're mocking God- oops! that's bearing false witness- that's a sin too...So forget about books like this. They ignore very simple facts. Like the world's in color- NOT black and white."
1,Simply Illogical,"The logic in Copan's argument is missing, thus I find it hard to say that he is argueing anything, but rather, is speaking nonsense. The twisted logic is something most children would be able to pick up on. I'm sad that I couldn't select 0, or maybe even a negative, number of stars to rank this ""work""."
4,Simple Logic Prevails Again...,"Copan demonstrates simply:1) that ""True For You, but not For Me"" statements are self-defeating statements;2) the need to ask simple questions such as, ""Is the statement, 'Anybody who only claims to deal in ""absolutes"" is either ignorant or a fraud.' an 'absolutely true' or 'absolutely fraudulent' statement?"";and 3) the need for sound methods of thinking in such ""relativistic"" times---regardless of one's worldview."
5,funny stuff,"In a review titled ""Ignore the High Raters- They've Got an Axe to Grind..."" on June 7, 1999, a reviewer from Vancouver, WA stated: ""Anybody who only claims to deal in ""absolutes"" is either ignorant or a fraud."" Heh heh. Lol. Do you really mean it? I should have known! Of *course* there are no absolutes, and moreover, it's *absolutely* true that anybody who claims to deal in them is either ignorant or a fraud! After all, if this weren't absolutely true, but only relatively so, its claim would be relative as well, and there'd be no point in saying it. Oh well, I guess he really showed us ignorant frauds. We're so dumb. :-)"
1,I can taste the hypocrisy in the air,"Copan takes objections to Christian ministry and gives a comeback involving why that person is in fact wrong. Examples include: ""All religions are basically the same"", ""It's all a matter of perspective"", ""Who are you to impose your morality on others?"" and so on.Copan's argument is that people can't discredit Christianity because morals aren't relative, we all know what is right and wrong. Frequently, he goes so far as to suggest that believing Christianity is not real is similar to believing that the Holocaust never happened. He spends most of his book instructing the reader on how to use a person's argument against them and then to continue to push what that person doesn't want to hear. He is just as close minded as the people he is trying to ""save"" and in short this book is a hypocritical guide book for conversion, and is frankly embarrassing. I don't feel like I should spend time reviewing a book that completely negates itself from the first sentence."
3,An interesting read,"I had high hopes for this book. I wanted it to provide me with some solid comebacks to these statements. And in part it did. It does site some scripture that is very helpful. But, it was somewhat hard to follow. I felt that the author spent more time trying to say that what he believes is right and everyone else is wrong, period. I would have liked some more logic . Anything other than the ""I said so"" attitude that is what came across. I thought as Christians we were supposed to witness and share the joy we've found in our Savior. This book gives the impression that condemning others is appropriate and that I do not agree with at all.Nevertheless, it was a fascinating look at one man's beliefs. As I said, it did have solid scripture references. Overall, it did not leave me with the best feeling, but then the book does point out that we are all different. You might want to pick up a copy and check it out for yourself."
4,Simply Fun,The characters are cute and it is fun playing for all ages. It can be quite addictive. There are short cuts to beat the other players but you will have to discover them yourself.
4,Classic,"Great game for younger kids just learning to play. Fun for us older kids too, you know those who were over 20 when the ps1 came out."
4,best cart racing game I've played,"to sum it up, don't let bad graphics get to you, because once you actually get into the gameplay it is much much better than any mario cart game. it has the basic grand prix, 1 on 1 races, tag team races(not like the crash one, it's a race where each player has 3 different racers and it works like a pass the baton race), and story mode. it has 9 starting tracks and 1 unlockable track, the ability to choose special abilities, and what I consider to be a much better item system then the other cart racers I've played. has quite a few characters to choose from with several more that are unlockable and the ability to make your own character(it even goes so far as varying the results of putting a point into a certain stat depending on the character you use as a base. that bout sums it up for me so I'll cut off here ->"
5,Favorite for the daycare!,"My daycare kids loved this so much, someone took it home and never returned it! Took us awhile to find a new one! We love it because more than one player can have fun, whihc is very important in daycare!"
2,Feeble,"Unimaginative, and not even good in comparison to other ""kart"" games.The game is highly focused on picking up magic crystals on the track and using them against opponents -- for example, getting three ""fire"" crystals hits *all* opponents with an unavoidable fire attack.And, frankly, what fun is that? You race well enough to take the lead, only to get hit with a cheap shot? There's certainly no place for such anti-rewards in a game aimed at anyone over the age of five, and those younger won't be able to handle the twisty tracks anyways.Breeding and raising Chocobos in ""Final Fantasy VII"" was fun. Racing them around in mario-karts most certainly is not."
3,Okay,"this is a okay game, by far better that CTR, but the character are all the same. Theyhave nothing to differenciate them. THey all steer the same and have the speed, but they have different abilities. There are tons of different square character's which are all pretty cool. Its a good game, considering it is a simple kart game."
2,"Six songs, not eleven.","The product description says this book contains eleven songs, but it only has six. Disappointed as it does not contain the songs I bought it for."
4,6th Chakra Segment is Distracting,"I love this CD...except for the track for the 6th chakra. Each segment has a natural sound to it: the root chakra has thunder, for example. The ""natural"" sound for the 6th chakra is supposed to sound ""celestial""; however, I found it distracting. The first time meditating with the CD, I experienced the first through 5th chakras and was in SUCH a good place--and then the 6th chakra segment came on and the noise was so distracting it ruined the entire moment. As I said, I love the rest of the CD. Perhaps Jonathan Goldman should have meditated a little longer on the natural sound he chose for the 6th chakra."
3,standard fair,"nice cd but much material is already covered, but its a start to a collection, If you combine this title with another Gracie Fields title Ramona you get the unusal mixture of familar and rare a great combination together with Gracies fans so from my own personal point of view the 2 discs present a real full picture of her wonderful talent."
1,Terrible Service,"I ordered this product, did not receive the correct poster and for the past month have been attempting to contact the company in order to replace it. I have received absolutely no reply--not even after attempting to go through amazon's return policies. I do not believe this company values costumer service."
3,Self limited construcion,"By the time this thing is mounted with a Manfroto ball joint head and a DSRL with a mid-sized lens, the resistance of the joints cannot hold the wight and they buckle. However, if they were to construct the joints with such stiff resistance, as to hold all that weight, they would be so difficult to bend and maneuver into the desired shape, that its use would become impractical as well. The design is a nice idea, but self-limited and really only useful for light-weight pocket sized cameras."
3,More trouble than it's worth,"I bought this so that I could get some close to ground shots with a Canon 40D that has a 70-300mm attached. It does hold all that weight, but you have to position the legs just right. Setting up the legs takes forever, which is why it's more trouble than it's worth most of the time. When I have a lot of time to set up a shot, it's great, but it's not a tripod I would take when I'm on the go.Pros: very flexible. I can get almost on the ground to a couple feet up. It also will allow for unusual angles, which is very fun.Cons: each leg and each of it's joint have to be adjusted to get the right shot.It's not easy to get it all straight again.It's screw is a pain, another type of attachment plate would be great."
5,Nice little product,This is a nifty little product - a must have for macro or travel. I use this tripod with my Canon XTi and 18-250 mm lens. It has enough power to hold the camera study. Intelligent design that is infinitely adjustable either for macro work close to the ground or for setting on table tops or even wrapping around a fence or a pole. Well designed and very light to carry around. Recommended product.
4,Very Happy,"Yes, It bounces. Yes, it can be difficult to set up. However if you use a ball head or pistol grip head from another tripod, the setup problem is eliminated. The bouncing is easily cured with the timer or a remote.It sure beats carrying my large tripod around during my vacation. I am able to make it grip on various objects and maneuver the camera with the pistol grip head to get the desired shot. I am using it with my Nikon D90 which I know is not the heaviest of DSRLs but I think for most people it would do just fine.I don't know if I would be happy if I did not have the pistol grip head to use with it. I tried to set up shots with out it and it is very difficult to aim the camera properly and make it stay where you want it to stay.Hope this helps."
2,Not very functional unless you purchase the ball head separately,"I have been very happy with the smaller version of this tripod, but GP3 has been mostly a disappointment. First of all, there is no ball head included, so adjusting both the angle of the camera and the position of the legs is challenging, and sometimes impossible. The only situation where this tripod works just fine is placing it on a flat table to shoot the subject perfectly positioned in the horizontal plane (but then who needs a tripod anyway?). Real life is seldom this simple, especially outdoors. My other problem with this product is the mounting screw which is hard to access and to turn. The slot in the screw head is wide and shallow, so using a coin to drive the screw does not work as it is supposed to. Other than that, GP3 seems sturdy and of good quality.All in all, as sold this is pretty much a dysfunctional piece of gear. If you want to make it useful you will need to consider the cost of ball head which is sold separately."
2,Not as expected!,Well my fault for thinking the picture used was enough to warrant a purchase. Just like the main pic on Amazon my use was exclusive to the Canon 70-200 f2.8 lens and 5d mkii camera....little did I realise this in fat this product DOES NOT support the weight. Reasonably upset considering I bought two units with matching ball-heads.Even after a bit of improvising the unit simply does not hold the lens and body up regardless of the positioning and items mounted.In the end I decided on using the units for my strobing efforts....they now hold two Canon 580 flashes.
1,This is a knock off- not a Joby product,Do not buy this. It is a cheap copy of the Joby Gorillapod. No where on the packaging or the item does it say Joby.
2,Poor quality,"My Gorillapod broke, after little use (More about that below), after 1 year and 2 months. Just 2 months beyond the 1-year guarantee.. It didn't even break while under use; I went to pick it out of my photo-bag one day, and the link where one of the 3 legs connect with the main 'body' had cracked, this making the whole thing unusable.And during the past year and 2 months I have probably used the contraption a grand total of 4 times. The main cause because whereas this is one of those things that look good on paper it just doesn't translate that well in to real world use. Getting the pod gripping tightly on to something while yet at the same time framing the shot you want is surprisingly frustrating. It should be noted that I had the SLR version of the pod, using it with an SLR camera. I can see this being /slightly/ more useful with a compact camera.I will not be replacing my broken Gorillapod, and I would not recommend anyone buy this product either."
3,Good but not as durable as I'd hoped,"I've owned two of these now, and find that they're good at what they do but the plastic joining the legs to the tripod head is somewhat fragile. If it gets pinned under, say, a MacBook Pro, or drops from more than a few feet above the ground, the plastic shatters, and while superglue can do some repair, it can never hold the same load without re-fracturing."
2,not strong enough for real SLRs,"I love the gorillapod for my compact, but for heavier weights even this ""SLR-Zoom"" version is useless.At one kilo or beyond you'll need an actual solid tripod."
2,Not strong enough,For just a DSLR and maybe a 50mm lens this product works just fine. Soon as you get into the heavier lenses this thing just gave out. Cannot hold my rebel t3i with sigma 70mm macro. Just falls over time after time no matter how i reposition it. Fantastic tripod for your everyday compact digital though.
4,Worst packaging ever...really ever,"I bought this for a friend as a gift, and when i opened amazon package, i was shocked to see that it was in a cheap cardboard box that read gorillapad on it and thats it. No manuals, no plastic wraps. For $50 at least put it in a sealed box so the gift is presentable. I dont know if it was original packaing or a rip-off from amazon affiliated company. She absolutely love it but very dissapointed on my side."
3,Item good--but piece missing,The gorillapod slr-zoom flexible tripod for digital slr camera is very good but is is missing a screw for it to be attached to a tripod. The package states that it is included. I have contacted the company twice and have not even received an acknowledgement much less a new part.
2,Not as good as a metal tripod,"The gorillapod has everything going for it except one glaring problem: A tripod is supposed to stabilize the camera, and the Gorillapod fails in this respect because even the smallest and lightest cameras vibrate and shake so badly after you take your hands off of the camera, that pictures turn out blurred. The problem is that the Gorillapod is made out of plastic and it is not stiff enough to prevent camera vibration, instead, it amplifies it and makes it worse. The only way to use the Gorillapod is with a 10 second timer to allow the vibrations to settle out...Nice try, but I'll stick with my miniature collapsible metal tripod...."
1,looks like a good idea but terrible in practice,I hate using this thing. If you want to adjust the angle of the camera then you have to move one of the legs around which is very hard to do accurately. It can also upset the weight of the camera so then you are adjusting multiple legs.
3,"Great tripod,but can't replace the regular tripod.","Great tripod,but can't replace the regular tripod.It's very convenient when 2~3 pepole hung out and want to have some pictures together. But still can't replace the regular tripod. The gorillapod require a obiect to attach. When you want to use it in a open place this gonna be a problem. But still a nice one."
5,So many options,I love this product. It allows for such a variety of camera mounting options in a compact size. You need this for DSLR. The smaller version will not work with DSLRs!
5,nice travel pod,"I did some cross country traveling and this guy was just the ticket.Easy to assemble, Easy to use and sturdy to hold up my DSLR"
2,Great idea but too hard to use,I found this difficult to make fast on oddly shaped objects. It looks easy in the videos but I couldn't seem to get the knack of it. I also found that on the ball head the QR Plate was too easily released by accidental bumping of the release button.
2,Does not support a DSLR with small zoom!,"I felt compelled to write this review and warn others--do not believe that this will support a larger DSLR with even a small zoom. I purchased this with the Joby ball head with the hopes of using it for wildflower photography while traveling. It would NOT support a D300 with 24-120VR lens--and this combo weighs much less than the 6.6 lbs claimed. No matter what I tried the gorilla pod collapsed, sagged, or tipped over. Absolutely a joke! I am not even convinced it would support a small DSLR like a D50. I returned it and instead bought a short center column for my regular tripod. Do not buy this expecting it to support an SLR. It did work nicely for my husbands prosumer super-zoom (Canon SX30IS) and I think that is the maximum size I'd use this for. So as advertised for a DSLR-Zoom I give it one star (zero if I could)--for a prosumer zoom it would get three or four."
1,Poor quality,At first the legs are ok but within few months the joints start to give in. I almost lost the camera due to a loose joint.Will not suggest anybody trusting this tripod with your expensive camera.There ra ebetter options such as Olympus.
4,Portability is its best feature,"I purchased this unit to use with my Pentax K20D & associated zoom lenses. I find however that due to weight of the DA* series lenses mounted on the K20D + Battery Grip, it may exceed the capability of this model. i.e. I noticed a the legs slide out a bit. I think part of it may be that I was testing it out on my kitchen counter (smooth surface). It may perform better on a rougher surface. Overall however, I think it will work fine for a conventional zoom lens mounted on a DSLR without a battery grip. I still plan to use it (with care)when I travel since carrying a full size tripod is not always practical. This fits very conveniently in my camera bag."
3,Gorillapod SLR-Zoom - Not bad,"The Gorillapod SLR-Zoom is a decent little tripod. The flexible legs are short, making it extremely portable. However, they are just a bit too short to give it the flexibility of use that the manufacturer claims. I also found that the claim that the SLR Zoom can support up to 6.6 lbs. to be a bit overstated. In my everyday use, I found the product to have difficulty with weights over 4 lbs. That said, it is a handy tool to keep in the camera bag."
4,"Great, but not perfect","Here's the deal: I love the pod, and it's good quality - it just doesn't hold up under the weight of my DSLR. To be fair, my lens is heavy, and doesn't have a separate mount to balance the weight, but I figured the heavy duty version would still support it.I also think the price point is a bit high for what you're getting, but then again, I paid it."
4,"nice, but could be a bit more functional","this adaptable tripod works great when set up properly, but can take a while to be set up sufficiently. The joints are nice and stiff, so they hold position very well. however, the ball-joints are large enough that you may have difficulty wrapping around smaller objects. also, the fastening bolt that screws into the underside of the camera rotates freely within and must be held still or turned from underneath while attaching the camera. (both prove a bit annoying when you finally get the tripod in the ideal position, then realize it's going to be a huge pain to screw on the camera)I've used this tripod many times for attaching my camera to my bike or car for action shots. once set up properly, it feels very secure. if the object is too small, you may have difficulty mounting the tripod to it and sub-sequentially encounter wiggle problems.overall, a good product for the money. very handy for trips and difficult vantage points."
3,Handles my XTi perfectly,"This is strong enough to hold up my XTi without any problems. It is a little difficult to get the angle you want. Maybe if it had a ""neck"" or something it would have been better. Something to adjust the camera once the legs have been secured.The screw to hold the camera is a bit awkward too. You need to take the nut off to screw your camera on the tripod. Don't lose the nut! I guess you can stick it in your pocket? Then, imagine your camera being a nut. You need to spin it around to secure it on the bolt. A little weird."
3,Useful Toy,"This item is a useful toy for a photographer who needs very easy to carry device to stabilize their camera. I will use it mostly for ground level macro photography or just carry it when I am traveling very light and don't want to schlep my ""real"" tripod. Always be careful to make sure the unit is completely secure when you wrap it around something instead of using it as you would a standard ""table top"" type of tripod. The 1/4""- 3/8"" adapter broke immediately as soon as I attached my ball-head and I had to use a spare."
3,waste of time,"In theory its a good idea and makes sense. But in reality, after using it a little, you have to fuse with it a lot to get it to form the way you want. It is faster to pull out your tripod and get the shot before the shot is gone."
2,"A good idea, but it works almost only as a TOY.","I ordered this device intended for my Canon D30 with a 17-40 4L EF lenses, which weigh a total of about 2 pounds, and as a limited size substitute for a real tripod. However, when I opened the box and mounted the camera, I could hardly make it stand on the desk without displacement due to the movement of the Gorillapod itself. As the result, it became almost impossible to use it to get a timed shot with the selected viewer window. In one word, it's lack the fundamental property of a tripod: stability.Whoever invented this, it needs another step to make it a real good deviceby the addition of some kind of a lock device (e.g., a screw) with which all the parts could be turn ON and OFF for any movement.I returned it within 2 days, thanks to Amazon's good return services,and I will have to stay with a traditional tripod."
2,Too expensive for a piece of plastic,"I don't get why these are very expensive. Yes they are functional, but I don't believe they are good quality, or made from fine materials, or easy to use."
5,Great Product,Excellent product for heavy SLR Cameras/Lenses. If you have a small camera consider getting a smaller Gorillapod.
3,Not what I thought it would be,I thought it would be easier to use. My unit had no way to connect the camera to the top of the tripod without screwing the camera on from the underside screw. I don't know if it supposed to come with anything else because there is no indication of what is supposed to be included on the box or the web page. The company that it actually comes from isn't Amazon. It's another company called Electronics Expo that I'm still waiting to hear back from. It's been two days now. I assumed it would have some kind of quick release foot like every other tripod usually has. All that came with mine was a little threaded adapter and the tripod itself. Can someone email me and let me know what you got with yours? neonknight65 at yahoo.
5,Great gadget,"Never leave home without it. This mini tripod has a home in my backpack. On a recent vacation it was the most talked about item among the camera-carrying crowd.I do wish it was a few inches longer, and would buy a slightly larger model if they had one, but then I'd just bring both (using one for slave flash)."
4,Gorillapod SLR-Zoom,"Great tripod for travel. Small, fairly light, and very versitile. It doesn't replace a regular tripod, but it is great for those shots that you need some stability. The tripod wraps around almost anything and can be put anywhere. It did exactly what I expected it to do and what I required. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for an alternative to a tripod but is looking for something flexible."
1,Tripod collapses with 3Kg DSLR+Telezoom lent...or even 1kg,"I read lots of very positive reviews about it so decided to go for the strongest model to support me during Safari.I have a nikon D90 and Sigma 150-150mm weighting a total of 3Kg with the battery grip.No matter the position, even the easiest one, the tripod collapses. Worse of it, it does not bear the weight of the camera body and a simple lent (1Kg).I am very disappointed and do not use it at all. Only consider this product for pocket camera, but nothing with real DSLR. Make a try in a shop to convince you..."
1,Avoid this product,"After a week of use the cheap plastic on this tripod crack. Save your money, buy something else."
1,legs broke,"I have a 5DMK2 and a 50D. I have been using this gorillapod for about 1 year. Recently used it on a snowboarding trip. Tried to grip my 50D to the hand rail by the tables outside the main lodge. One of the leg broke off and I almost lost my 17-40mm L lens mounted on my 50D! Maybe it only last for 1 year?? or Maybe be I gripped it too hard that one of the leg piece came off from the force. But if my 50D is still moving on the handrail, I'm going to make damn sure it is secured before I walk away.The gorillapod grip is a great concept, but they need to make one that is durable for all conditions."
4,Love It,"I bought this tripod before going on vacation this year. I was able to be in some of the pictures this year. It was so easy to pack, light to carry around while attached to the camera, and always ready to take a picture. I always take family group photo when we go on vacation. I didn't have to prop up the camera on a shopping bag of souvenirs I bought, so I could be included in the photo and avoid getting the ledge of whatever the camera was sitting on in the picture. I think I will also buy the Snake Monopod as well when it's available."
1,Misleading Product,"I purchased the SLR-Zoom tripod after doing some research on the Joby website and was very excited about the product. When it arrived, I was very disappointed. All of the pictures of the product, the instructions on using the tripod, and the product video all discuss the Ball Head, which can be used to easily level the camera. What is not mentioned is the Ball Head is NOT included with the camera, but costs an additional $40. Sure, if I would have read the fine print I might have found this out, but I find that to be misleading... so buyer beware.Besides that, the legs on the tripod are rather stiff, making it difficult to easily level the camera (without purchasing the Ball Head add-on). It's not designed for quick shots... plan to spend a fair amount of time setting up and composing your shot. The camera screw used to secure the camera on the tripod is also difficult to use and not conveniently located for taking the camera on and off the tripod."
5,Great tripod.,It's very very strong. It's compact and rather light so you can take it everywhere. I really love it. I use it with my Nikon D3000 and different lenses.
3,Too flimsy to handle large camera and lens,"It worked well enough for smaller set ups, but my setup of Canon 60D and EFS 17-55 f/2.8 was too big for this. THe legs kept giving away and I had to make special balanced shapes of the legs to stand it up."
3,GorillaPod - good but not great ...,"What I like :a. It's reasonably rigid and does not change position under the camera's weight.b. VERY light - love that !c. Takes standard 1/4"" and 3/8"" screw mounts for most cameras / tripod heads so works with all your gear. (But see below !)What could improve :a. Not very stable with long lenses. (I think they may have to change the laws of physics to fix that problem !)b. Open package VERY CAREFULLY, or you may lose the 3/8"" adapter ! It's a small thing and you will lose it unless you look out for it.c. I had expected it to be a bit longer; the legs are not that long, so the ability to wrap the thing around pipes / tree branches / park bench handles, is a bit constrained as you often run out of leg !Overall does the job reasonably well."
3,"Not fabulous, but has some uses","This GorillaPod is a good choice for small cameras like a DSLR with a small, light lens or a GoPro -- but it's an awful choice for heavy lenses like the 70-200mm as pictured with the item on Amazon. If you have a heavy camera, you really can't have the legs all the way up, as they'll creak and come lose, which topples your camera over. But, if you bend the legs up at the bottom and have the camera close to the ground, it will stabilize it. As far as wrapping the legs around something, forget about it with a DSLR -- but it's perfect for wrapping around railings or similar with a GoPro. It's not excellent, but it imperfectly fills that void between trying to balance a camera on a surface or lugging around a big, heavy tripod."
4,Works pretty good,"I do a lot of nature photography (ForestWander Nature Photography) and this really came in handy on my last photo expedition.There were times and places that I just could not use a full size tripod. Also, I like to get those kind of shots where my camera is nearly touching the water and this made it possible for my camera to be just a couple inches off the ground without getting it dirty.I would just like to have a mounting head that will work with my full size tripod also so I don't have to keep unscrewing it from my camera."
4,Works well....,"I bought this for my Canon Xsi with 55-255 Zoom lens. It is definitely strong enough to hold it.It got plenty of attention when I wrapped it around the railing to capture the sunrise at the summit of Haleakala on Maui!I didn't give it 5 stars for 2 reasons.1 - Kinda heavy, bulky....not as easy to pack as I had thought.2 - no quick release option makes attaching it to your camera a bit of a pain....I would recommend some sort of adjustable ball mount."
5,Very good item,"Used it for filming from a moving vehicle - excellent stability! Also, ideal for travel - fits into a coat pocket, doesn't weigh much."
4,Very useful for laboratory,"A significant amount of our laboratory equipment is threaded for standard tripod screws. I'm using this to hold a neural recording front-end amplifier, for what it's worth, and the legs allow me to either spread it wide and squat over a sample, or to hang it (upside-down) from a ringstand, without disconnecting the wires.Still, the legs are not easy to reposition, bending in the wrong spot or flexing the other legs unless you carefully sculpt each leg into shape. It's good if you intend to reposition your equipment rarely, or if you need flexibility, but it's hard to work with in a very tight space. There are few products to really compare this to, but I have two other Gorillapods in different sizes and it would be nice if this included the strong magnetic feet some of the other models have."
3,Good entertainment but no targeted teaching,"My daughter loves Hi5 and this DVD. The songs and dances are fun. She can watch it all day (she does actually...). For the entertainment value I'd give it 5 stars. However, I was also expecting some educational element to it - you know, like Barney or Sesame Street but with more fun hip music and dancing. I was a little disappointed because it is primarily about entertaining kids and not about any targeted teaching. For that I gave it 3 stars. Perhaps it has something to do with what other reviews have indicated about poor editing and that `the DVD seems to be a compilation of episodes rather than exact episodes'. Perhaps that's why it seems choppy to me and lacks any targeted teaching."
4,Wasnt as good as the others.,Great items for kids and parents. Sent them off to other family members to enjoy and share with their kids.
5,A must for Hi-5 fans,...she got addicted to Hi-5 after this DVD. I had to take it away ...she only gets to watch it on Saturday morning .... For parents -- not annoying as other kiddie DVDs. Seems to me all of the music is recycled 80's dance music.
5,It's a fuel filter,"It is what they claimed it to be. I have no way to measure how perfectly it filters, but my engine has run fine since I put it on and my carb kept getting stuff in it before."
4,Works fine,"Wix makes some of the best oil filters on the market, so I assume these inline fuel filters are of high quality as well. I'm using these with good results on outdoor power equipment. The 33001 is for 1/4"" fuel line.I docked it one star because of the size. These are very large - about 1.5-2"" or so in diameter. That's good because it means more filter media which should translate to longer filter life, but it's also bad because it means they may not fit easily on some types of equipment."
3,Get It on Tonite (Single),"This song is really great and the sound tuning is prefect. Itis an import, so it costs a little more money . Don't get me wrongit's a great CD, but it isn't your best bargain. END"
1,Picture references are great but are very unorganized.,"I bought this book at a local book store at Penn State University. I thought that the pictures would help and that this was a good dictionary, especially for paying almost $20.00. However, trying to use the book just added more confusion. The dictionary contains no adverbs or adjectives .. nothing but nouns. If you are an anatomy major in Brazil trying to learn English, maybe this will help you. You learn more about forbidden body parts than of regular day to day language. Even if you have to pay extra money for a bulky, overpriced dictionary, it's better than buying this one."
4,Excellent Book,"An amazing book with so much insight to offer about the lives of LGBQT's during the 1950s and 60s. Adequately written, though the intensity of the story overshadows this fact. The book could have been in slightly better condition according to the item condition status, but I mostly got what I paid for."
5,Our Destiny set in STONE,"I found this book to be deeply moving. The circle goes unbroken to this day. As a young butch in the 90's I find myself in similar situations as Jess. Though I know they are not as extreme as what use to be, they hurt just as deeply. Someday there may be an alternative to Stone Survival - the only way we know."
5,Connecting with Hir,"People see transsexuals in tabloids or an occasional film, either slasher or comedy roles. How often do we get to journey with a person who's transsexual from childhood through an adult coming into hir own? As a female heterosexual who grew up in a conservative background, I found this life-based novel a needed way to understand what my life might've been like, if.Feinberg shows all us what it's like to grow up and explain hir kind of natural to people who only acknowledge ""it"" in order to deny/destroy ""it."" You connect to Jess, because isolation, rejection, acceptance, foolishness, and growing are such universal themes. Feinberg's writing helps you to be Jess through childhood, adolescence, romance, jobs, arrests, stubbornness, and personal triumphs.I needed to walk in Jess's shoes, and Feinberg made that possible: the accomplishment of a good writer. Why didn't I get this book in my high school classes?"
5,You will cry,"If you are Butch or have ever known or loved a Butch, this book will make you cry. The story tumbles out in one unending pouring, and that is probably how you will read it. There are tons of anthologies and gender study books, but Stone Butch Blues is the only novel I know of written with with so much grit and longing. It is a rare courageous glimpse into the struggles of an impoverished Butch dyke who's strong voice would ordinarily not have much reach. I love this book and often purchase extra copies to give away to other Butches and Femmes. It renders our history beautifully, and for that reason I consider Feinberg's first novel to be a gift to the world."
5,The best book I've read in YEARS!,"This book made me laugh, made me cry, but mostly I just enjoyed it. I don't think anyone would be able to put it down!"
2,Disappointed.,"I'm a male, and I find butch women extremely attractive. When I saw this book, I expected it to be the love woes of a masculine woman who couldn't find her place in the world. Instead, I cannot get past the first chapter, which is nothing but ""men are evil."""
3,Disappointed,"I became interested in this book about a year ago, but it wasn't until a month ago that I decided to pick it up. The subject matter is moving and important and that is why I feel for this kind of book the writing itself could be better. The dialogue is cheesy and pretentious. I am simply disappointed."
1,Cheap,"An important historical chronicle, however, the quality of the writing is consistently, unbelievably poor. Clichés permeate the page, the characters are 2-dimensional and belong in after school specials, emotional impact is conveyed through insultingly obvious explanations, the narrator is supposed to be stoic yet she cries every five pages. Strong emotion is not just tears. And while the message is important-- it's completely spelled out for the reader every page-- the fact that this is 6th grade level writing makes everything feel incredibly exploitative and thoroughly unconvincing."
2,Guess my expectations were too high...,"Although I have to agree that the concerns of the lesbian and gay communities should be taken seriously and are important, I cannot really praise this book. The cheap metaphors are offending the reader's intelligence. Only homosexuality doesn't make a good writer. Nevertheless, I liked the interesting chronology."
1,Horrible,"This book was a waste of my time. It was for school, and we all hated it. Uneducationally written and disgusting lifestyle."
1,Stone Butch Blues,"I was required to read this book for a class in college. I would never have picked it otherwise. I learned that these people are just as messed up as the rest of us, fighting and clawing their way through life. It was an honest depiction of lesbian life and I do commend it for this."
4,stone butch blues rocks,"Stone butch blues is a touching story that attempts to explain the life of a young girl, Jess, and her journey into the culture of being different. From as long as she can remeber, Jess has never been like her peers, instead she is classified as the ""other"". The book describes her pain and hardship as she learns who she is and waht she is destined to be. Realising that she is a butch, a he-she.Through her experiences, both negative and positive, Jess finaly finds herself.This book draws upon various issues, such as discrimination and women's liberation, prividing an insightful experience in the life of a person who differs from the norm."
3,Not for the Kindle2,"This book should not be purchased as a Kindle edition. The text looks like it's been scanned, sometimes even blotchy as if the original was not in good condition to begin with. Also, once you turn off the Kindle it looses where you stopped reading - you better know your location or bookmark the page, because every time you power up your Kindle you will start over at the title page."
2,Fractured Plot but Readable,"I enjoy Steven Saylors choice of topics and his writing style, however for me this was not one of his best books in terms of plot - the mystery does not even start until late in the book (this is a mystery isn't it?), and it seems overly contrived that Gordianus becomes a first hand witness to so many major historical events."
1,Thoroughly Disappointing!,"I so wanted to enjoy this book but found it lacking in the plotting, mystery and verve that the other books in this series had. The mystery is contrived and most importantly, transparent. Gordianus has become a moralizing, old stick-in-the mud. It just wasn't any fun to read! Had this been the first book of this series I read, it would not inspire me to read the others."
2,The judment of Caesar,The sparcle of the earlier Sub Rosa novels is missing. The histories of Caesar and Cleopatra are told so many times that they are worn out. As an European I cannot swallow without hilarity the ideal all American family life of the 1950s movies set in ancient Alexandria
2,A big step down...,"I enjoyed several of the earlier books in this series, both because the mystery was well thoughtout and because the sttings were interesting in their own right. But as the action has become more intwined with historical figures, the mysteries have suffered and the prose become, like most novels revolving around historical personages, very stilted.[...] The historical events and personalities seem to be acting as a crutch more than as a setting."
3,An Ancient Roman Mystery,"This is a different type of book for me. I found it interesting because of the descriptions offered about life in Caesar's time in Rome and in Egypt. I don't know how much is fact or fiction, but the author apparently has done a lot of research and written several books on ancient Rome. I would recommend this book for a change-of-pace type read."
5,An enjoyable vist with an old friend,"First, writer's of historical fiction are not required to be 100% acurate with their facts. It is called FICTION. They certainly must be 100% true to the tenor of the times and the basic characters of their protaganists. Saylor, as always, does this. Most important he is true to the essence of his series characters.Second, the next in the series? I don't know. I always wondered why Saylor aged his hero so quickly. Do we know why now?Third, it's a good read. Up to his usual very fine standards."
4,Tug of War...,"More historical fiction than historical mystery, I still liked this latest installment of Gordianus the Finder, who seems to find himself at a crossroads as he struggles to come to terms with alienating his adopted son and his sick, possibly dying, wife. He arrives in Alexandria at his wife Bethesda's request, in order to ""take the cure"" by immersing herself in the Nile's ""sacred"" waters. At the same time, Pompey has arrived to seek Egyptian support after his defeat at Pharsalus. What comes after is history and Gordianus is there to witness the tug of war between Caesar, Cleopatra, and Ptolemy, which I think is basically what this novel is about. Hardcore Gordianus mystery fans might be disappointed because the mystery plays a small part in the novel, but in Saylor's version of events, it tips the balance historically as Caesar chooses between Ptolemy or Cleopatra."
3,Code Complete,I read this book and I thought it was very informative. The only problem that I had with it was the size of the book. I think some of the points they made could have been sumarized a lot quicker.
5,Every beginning programmer should own this,McConnell does just an excellent job explaining much of the rationale behind some Good Things when writing procedural code. I'm an RPG programmer and learnt many good things.Recommended!
5,A very useful book for any programmer,"This is a book about general aspects of the art of programming, like wich names you have to assign to variables, how long need to be the functions, how complex needs to be a module... All this things are aplicable to all the programming languages.The book has a lot of examples in C and in Basic, and the most important, a lot of errors that even the most experienced programmers make.This book it's a must have for any programmer. Be sure that after reading it you will write a cleaner and more beautiful code."
3,"Out of date, and targetted for newbies.","This book is horribly out of date. It was written in the early 90's, and the author deals mainly with a handful of programming languages, only one of which people really use nowadays. Furthermore, much of the information is very basic. There is definite value in reading this book if you're a new college grad, and have no industry experience; there are lots of common sense coding practices detailed that people generally pick up on the job. However, for those with industry experience, especially those who have worked on a released product, the entirety of this book will old hat, save for chapter 31-Personal Character, which I think is deserving of a read by everyone - but just spend 10 minutes with it in a bookstore."
1,Excellent,"All book taught me are too numerous to mention. However, one thing stands out. I can now look at anyone's code and immediately find at least one thing wrong with it no matter how much more experienced or talented they are than me. It helped me develope a style that is effective and respected. I can always easily argue my reasons for coding things the way I do."
1,"Full of fluff Waste of time reading, waste of money buying","This book seemed like an interesting book upon skimming, but as I tried to delve deeper into it I realized there was little in this book that can really help me write better code. It's all theory and abstract suggestions. A much better book is 'Writing Solid Code' (also in the same series) which is only half as thick but probably has 100 times more 'meat'. I'll bet most of the reviewers here wrote their reviews before actually digesting much of the book!"
3,On the dry side.,"This book gets the basic picture right, which must be why so many people like it. Maybe they even like the rather dry style. Personally, I prefer Hunt and Thomas's _Pragmatic Programmer_ or Beck's _Extreme Programming Explained_, which cover more or less the same topics in a lighter, case-based style. And let's face it, we're not proving theorems here, just pointing out some commonsense and some hard learned rules of the road."
5,"If you don't have it, get it!","Out of the dozens of programming books I've read, this may well be the most useful. It covers basic software engineering practices that every serious programmer should adopt. Unless you're coding in a cave and never look at old code, you owe it to yourself and coworkers to read and apply the principles in this book."
5,The single best book on the craft of writing software.,"McConnell has read years and years worth of computer science literature and distilled it into an extremely readable format. It is a hefty 800+ pages but you will rip through it and enjoy every minute. McConnell combines wit and valuable information into a gem of a technical book. If you program and you haven't read this book you are doing yourself a great disservice. McConnell also goes to great lengths to avoid dogma. He presents many sides to what sometimes seem like religous issues in programming. He gives you the information to make your own decisions. Trust me, you MUST read this book."
5,Wonderful book - get this BEFORE you learn to code - BUY IT,"I was looking for a C(++) primer and stumbled on this book. It was the best investment I could have ever made on programming concepts. All my schooling was pretty much shot after I read this book. This is a MUST for those of you looking to right ""perfect"" code - or near as you want. After reading this book you will be able to not only write code (of your choice) but write it with a ""clean-ness"" not found in standard code. A must BUY - 5 stars all the way. I agree with one comment that says ""you will see other peoples mistakes - after reading this book"" - and even thiugh he thinks of this as a negative - I use it a a positive - to be able to ""clean-up"" my own code."
5,Puzzled about your website,"I would like to purchase ""Stores of the Year 11 and other related books. Please help me to find your contact address and how to purchase. Your web site is very much confusing or I do not have much knowledge about it. (basically I am a web designer) and How to submit this form?Regards"
2,Main character is too modern,"When I read Regency genre books I expect Regency period behavior, not contemporary culture in masquerade, and I certainly don't expect a two or three page sex scene, either. If you want to write sex scenes, do it in a Regency Historical or a contemporary. It's not really a bad book, but the main character does not act anything like a young girl of 18 or 20 should behave in this time period, and I also wasn't able to sympathize with her, even if she did have a lot of problems with her family life. In fact, there wasn't ANYONE in the book I found really likeable or to whom I cared what happened, with the exception of Lizzie, the cute little five year old, and the two great aunts.On the plus side, Ms. Greene does know how to write. Her words flow nicely and it reads well... Perhaps with more work on making her Regencies fit the period better, her next book will be better."
4,"Pleasing, quick read",The story is sweet and a quick read. The heroine is one of those cant get it right types that prevail in regencies.The hero in this story is so infinitely patient he seems unreal. But overall this story is a good one. I'd like to see more from this author.
3,Ok,it was a nice book...now I have to make up a bunch of words to make your quota...I read this quite awhile agoooooooo.
2,"Great documentary, disappointing music value","Expecting all the songs of the album in full I was disappointed that most songs were broken up and used around commentary. However, the information about the history of the album from concept to birth and beyond was very interesting. Worth renting but I wouldn`t recommend anyone to buy it if expecting more of the music."
2,"Long on History, Short on Music","This DVD is very good for what is is - a narrative history of Bat Out of Hell through the eyes of the people who wrote, produced, and performed this classic album. It should be a major disappointment, however, to anyone buying it for the music. The only song performed in its entirety is Heaven Can Wait. The others songs are only in short concert clips. The sound is only PCM Stereo. This is one to rent or borrow, not to own."
5,"Meat Loaf: Bat Out Of Hell, Treasure From Heaven","This video is a true treasure, the insights from Meat Loaf, Todd Rundgren, Karla DeVito, Ellen Foley, Jim Steinman, and others lend a whole new depth to the reality of this very important piece of musical history. Meat lovers everywhere will thoroughly enjoy this look behind the curtain. Meat had it then, he's still got it now, he'll never stop rockin'!"
2,Bad Choice,"When I purchased this item, I was expecting a concert, not a review of the artist nor a commentary, which is all that I received. I have since, sold this DVD to a used DVD store. I don't recommend this to Meatloaf fans, bad choice."
2,"Meatloaf,hits out of hell","I bought this VCD because i thought it would have all the ""BAT OUT OF HELL"" songs on it however there were only 4 songs from this classic album on the disc and I felt a bit cheated."
1,Bat of of Hell has gone to hell,"This DVD is absolutely terrible. It is basically a running commentary on the life and times of Meat Loaf. Get real. The album is fantastic and what I wanted to hear were that songs that I love, instead all that is on this DVD is the band members talking about what went into the songs. The only song that is there that is complete is Heaven can wait at the very end. This DVD is definitely not worth the money."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"Because the CD is fantastic I wanted to see it on DVD. I bought this one & was totally disappointed. The information was interesting, once. If it had been a music DVD I would be watching it over & over. As it is, once is enough."
2,Terk - the new kids on the block.,"I helped install one for a friend and was amazed at just how mediocre its reception was. Personally, I was never a fan of Terk stuff... back to when they had those space-age looking amplified indoor FM antennas - they didn't work well either. TV antennas are not rocket science. Look at name brands with long histories that include GAIN specs. One such name is Channel Master. Remember that name? I bet you had both VHF and UHF types on your roof before you got cable/sat service. Anyway, HDTV antennas are MERELY UHF antennas. Nothing more. The Channel Master 4228 is a SOLID performer and sells for about $50. Oh - keep it OUT of your attic! Esspecially if your house is aluminum OR vinyl sided (vinyl sided homes usually have the foil backed styrofoam insulation underneath) plus all those nails holding the shingles in place don't help either."
1,A great disappointmnent,"We bought this antenna for our new HDTV but were very disappointed for its poor performance. The reception was poor despite hours of tunning and optimal location. Some supplied brackets did not have holes drilled correctly making them useless. We had to find out substitutes from hardware stores. The workmanship was clearly inferior. On top of that, customer and tech support were very unhelpful and unprofessional.Overall, we cannnot recommend this product."
5,The Best Baseball Game I've Ever Played!,"This game is so cool! You can trade crummy players for All Stars! Not only are the trades great, but the controls are easy to use and the game is very fun. I have played seven straight games and have even pitched a no-hitter using Doug Drabek! If you are going to get a baseball game, this is the one to get!"
3,"Not bad, but All-Star baseball is better","Not a bad game, but batting is too easy and too uninvolved. you just press A when the ball is coming toward you, and you automatically make contact if you timed it right. Just not enough fun. Recommend the All-Star baseball titles, they are much better!"
1,horrible,This game is abosolutely terrible. Other than the stadium graphics there is not one redeeming quality about it. Avoid at all costs.
4,Recommended,Billy Batstone provides a good blend of melody and rhythm with lyrics that glorify Jesus Christ. The more you listen to this album the more it will become a favorite.DRM
4,It fits like ait is supposed to.,This does fit like it is supposed to but the instructions and pictures could be a little clearer. That being said it was not a difficult installation but it did take a few minutes to get the placement correct. Once I figured out where it went it only takes a about an hour and a half to install and put the origional skidplated back up.
3,Funny,"This book has a lot if interesting stories filled with lots of humor. For someone that is involved with the aviation industry, it brings back lots of memories. Although some may think that a lot of the stories are fabricated, things like this do happen. I wish they could have gotten a lot more of these stories together and done a larger book. But overall it was funny the price I paid for it was right, and I would recommend this book to any one."
4,"too bad about the money, al","really nice disk from austin-based alt.country rocker alejandro escovedo. actually, the alt.country label may be both overly confining and misleading: escovedo started out as a punk (the nuns) and subsequently moved through a variety of bands including punk-country (rank&file) new romantic (the troobs) revivalist (buick mckane). his bands often feature strings (as in violin and cello). so what we've got is a middle-aged singer-songwriter with a punk background and string players in his band. uh-huh.one could argue with some of the song selections (where's ""put you down""?) but the covers are interesting (the stones ""sway"", lou reed's ""street hassle"" and a violin/cello driven version of the stooges' ""i wanna be your dog."" yeah, you read that last part right. he turns the string players loose on that one and they make like the second coming of john cale."
2,Another book about 98 degrees!,"I have this book, it ok! I hear that 98 degrees will release their own in September! This book is mostly taken from magazines that have interviewed them, most of this book is good for reading if you want to know more about these talented guys!"
5,Don't miss this one,"Rossini's Petite Messe Solennelle is rarely heard in today's concert halls, which is a pity, because this is great music in every respect. The instrumentation is spare, but brilliant, there are intimate as well as grandiose parts and many moving moments. Soloists, choir and orchestra are kept on their toes throughout the 80+-minutes work. If I ever heard an ideal interpretation of the Messe, this is it: Riccardo Chailly--visibly moved by the musical and spiritual event--and his Leipzig musicians, including the organist and, of course, the two choirs are superb. The four soloists, obviously familiar with Rossini's idiom and bel canto, are in glorious form. Audio (uncompressed: bravo EuroArts!) and video of the 2008 recording are exemplary. Don't miss this one."
1,Cheap materials!,"At the time, this was the most expensive phone I had ever purchased. I fell in love with design and color of the phone and it worked great, especially overseas. However, the silver colored plastic on the face of the phone started peeling (from contact with skin oils, perspiration, etc.) after owning it only 6 months or so. I researched it and other people who contacted Nokia got replacement phones that did the exact same thing within a few months. I was a loyal Nokia customer for over 10 years (my first phone circa 1997 was a Nokia). Needless to say, I am no longer a Nokia customer."
1,Do not buy this phone or you will be regret!!!,"I would rather give this product ""Zero"" star. It looks good from picture, but once you receive on your hand, you will understand what I am talking about. The battery cover is extreme difficult to remove from the phone.For a phone marked as $400+, it is not worth at all. The phone keeps unresponding or could not power it off. The only way to rest this phone is removed the battery. The N76 I got is really a piece of junk.I bought this phone for my wife as her birthday. After few hours with the phone. She just wants me to return the product back to Amazon ASAP. Don't waste your time and money for this good looking phone."
1,The box was open,"This product was finally shipped to me after several delays, and when I finally got it, the box was opened and the phone was damaged on the sides. It had no plastic cover for the memory card, but it didn't need it, since it didn't bring the included memory card neither. The charger was also missing.My choice was to send it back (and pay the 2-way shipment) or living with a ""new"" cellphone that looked like it was roughly used for a year.At first I though the box was opened on the way here, but unless someone in FedEx put his really mistreated cellphone (identical to the one i bought) in the place of the new one, I doubt it could be accidentally (or even on purpose) damaged that way.Since the shipment from my country was waaaaay too expensive I had to keep it, so don't let it happen to you. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!"
3,Nine West Shoes,These shoes are a little tough. Not good for walking at all.But they look good and fit well.
4,Very Well Made For The Price,"As the tag line says, this is a very sturdy 13 foot light stand that offers about the best price performance in that length. Highly recommend this stand, if you need that height."
5,Arrived on time,Good sturdy stand. I purchased three and have not been disappointed. I'm expecting to get years of use out of these stands.
1,Fell apart on the first use,"I have the Savage background stand and expected this light stand to work well. The first time I opened it, a small piece of plastic fell off the bottom and the legs flapped around. Several of us tried to reinsert the plastic bit but no one could figure out how to get it back in and stabilize the legs. I'll look for something else."
4,Seems sturdy,Used it once and it seemed sturdy. It was an outside photoshoot. Love the versatility in heigth. Overall a good buy. Time will tell if its worth purchasing another one or not.
2,Fred Dances on the ceiling,"Once upon a time an ordinary looking guy made millions of American enjoy the act of dancing in film. Fred Astair was no pansy - the dances were incredibly difficult yet he made them appear so easy. Dancing with a hat rack and cavorting on the ceiling are STILL so entertaining. Actually, these are the ONLY reasons to see ""Royal Wedding"".The second film on this disk is somewhat enjoyable - ""Second Chorus"" unites Fred with Burgess Meredith (!) in their pursuit of Paulette Goodard, and a job with Artie Shaw. A simple dance number with Miss Goddard is mildly amusing, but the comic interplay is more enjoyable."
4,Lofty reading!,"A friend sent an email extolling this book, and I had to read it based on her review. The author is first-class, and I enjoyed the way the story unfolded - plus it is a revealing glimpse into an era of our US history that is not taught in school. An excellent read!"
5,Something for Everyone,"I won't go into detail about the storyline of this book because that's been done to great lengths by the reviewers before me, but I will say that this story contains something of interest for everyone. It is an awesome read that I couldn't put down. Everyone to whom I've lent it agrees. I plan to read it again."
1,Mechanics by Symon,"An extremely poorly written book!!. Almost no examples. Pure dictation of formulas, which my pet parrot alreadymemorized. Too much pep talk without hard core derivation of equations. Chapter on tensors badly written with outdated symbolsThis book is the epitomy of the failure of physics and scienceeducation in the US, no wonder, we need to import so manyPHD's from overseas while our own creativity in physicsdeclines steadily as a result of too much ""snowing""from this type of book, which instills fear, discouragement,and frustration to our young aspiring physics students."
1,The worst book in the world,"If I could give this book -(infinite) stars I'm sure I would. Theres nothing so bad in all times. Symon just gives thousands and thousands of formulas, without explaining anything. How can a book of physics have no examples? The exercises are also idiot, very simple and repetitive."
3,Standard Mechanics Test,Decent mechanics test book for under graduates. Many problems for each chapter. Unfortunately many of the answers in the back of the book are are wrong. Very careless of the author.
4,Excellent resource,"I used this book in my two semester-long intermediate mechanics classes, and I came away with an excellent understanding of the subjects covered. I plan on keeping this text as a resource throughout my career in physics."
5,Trail of Bones is excellent,"This meets all of my expectations! Trail of Bones is just as much of a ""can't put it down"" read as her first, The Bone Lady. This is a must read. I eagerly anticipate the third."
2,Boring,"The introduction is good, but when you continue reading becomes boring........I don""t like it. Not re-commend. I started to read the book and I left it to try to read later, maybe............"
3,It's Okay,"Its concepts are amazing to any programmer but, widely known, I learned just as much from my Instructor in my post-secondary class then I did in this book. The Karel code also gets a little boring. However, to be a good programmer you need to know these concepts through and through, so I do find it useful as an introduction to programming. I don't recommend it to anyone who knows their own logical style well already; it will be useless to you."
3,"Book is quite good, Software does not run.","The presentation of the concepts of programming and the building of layers of complexity was handled in a competent and easily read manner. However, the software simulator is completely out of date and does not run under windows 98. For beginning programming students with little or no other computer experience, this would be a good starting point...IF the software worked."
4,Science Goes to War,This was a very interesting book. full of factual information. It studys the whole world in leangthy process not just the US. Says a lot about the A bomb as far back as Da Vinci.
1,Science Goes To War,This book makes a number of absurd mistakes - sometimes even getting things exactly backwards - which someone actually familiar with the particular topic (such as radar) would find laughable.
3,Good book but full of inaccuracies,"The topic is quite interesting and relevant considering our current situation. The early part of the book is the most gripping, but I have to say that the chapters dealing with the 20th Century were a big let down. Volkman is correct in saying only a couple of people left the Manhatten project, but he does not mention that many scientists refused to work on the project. The data is skewed to represent the thesis of author, but it would have been nice to read about some of the counter arguments, such as the early peace movement among scientists in the 16th Century. It would have been notable if more effort could have been made towards some of the scientist peace movement successes (such as the ban on some areas of biological research during the 1970s). There are however, lots of little nuggets of information that keep the readers' interest until the end. Inside this book, there is a great one waiting to come out. Perhaps in a later edition....."
2,Dissapointed...,"I am very dissapointed in this game... It has great graphics on it, but it strayes from what Tribes was originally created for. I'm what players on the game call an ""Old School Player"" so i have all 3 games in the Tribes Series. I started playing the original tribes back around 1998, before Tribes 2 came out. The original tribes was extremely customizable on your equipement setups and allowed for easy server side modifications to the game. Tribes vengeance you cant... You have 4 slots of equipment to choose from and thats it. You cannot add equipment or special features to make your games unique. You can however make different game rules. The only part of the game i enjoyed was the grapple, being able to act like spiderman and sling shot around was fun for me and I enjoyed it. If i where to choose between the original Tribes, and Tribes: Vengeance, i would choose the original Tribes any day."
4,Charming,"Why are some of Katie Fforde's novels so hard to find in the U.S.? I finally got a copy of this novel and it is utterly charming. Unlike some of her other novels, this one has three love stories and they are all sweet (but a little predictable). I liked the May/Hugh storyline the best. If you like Katie Fforde, you will not be disappointed by this novel."
4,I'll make this one short and simple,"Gameplay= boring as hell...graphics= amazingstory= what rpg's are all aboutI found this game a little to short compared to other rpg (15+ hours). the battle system and gameplay was not to fun either.But in the areas this game lacks, it more then makes up for in the story department."
4,Parasite Eve,"Probably one of the most ""Must Have"" RPG games out there. Filled with great graphics, action, plot, and of course, weapons. I could not stop playing this game, its very intense, and moment by moment u want to find out who Eve is."
5,Very Original Game,"When I bought this game, I was expecting something totally different, something along the lines of Resident Evil but it was totally the opposite. The story line was so interesting that I couldn't stop playing it. The battles are great, but just like any RPG game there are some enemies that will frustrate you.The graphics and sound are great especially for a Playstation One game. Bottom line...if you want an RPG game that doesn't involve the usual fantasy world with a mystical hero who saves all then this game is perfect.Even though the game is a little short, it will continue to keep you in suspense till the very end."
4,Great Game!,"This game seems to have the same gaming engine as Resident Evil. All the movie clips that come on are really kool. The game play is smooth and rich along with some nice graphics. If you have played R.E. then you will be comfortable with this games controls.Overall the game is a bit on the easy side, especially since I don't finish games too often and once you finish it you may not actually go back to it. I know I have not. Since the release of part 2 this one has dropped in price so would encourage someone to purchase it. I give it 4 stars because it really is not a bad game I just found it a little easy. I thought Resident Evil was much harder."
1,Dont even bother!,I bought this game and the graphics are terrible. the game is slow.....waste of time
1,parasite eve,"the worst game ive ever played,very weak weapons and by the way can only be used when eve reaches a certain enery level. if your a re fan you'll probably hate this boring weak, weak game.i never completed game stupid and boring."
3,Interusting epic!,"This game has a awsome story line and great graphics! It is kinda like a RPG and a Action game in one. The battle screen is itnerusting and so are the vidios in it, thay are very realistic and graphic! The only thing that disapointed me in this game was that the game play hours were not that long and that is pretty rare by a game that is built by Square Soft. If you like Science Fiction movies then you will love this game! The story line in it is more like a movie then a vidio game but Square always has the best story lines if you ask me!"
5,Let the Eve within you awaken.......,"This is my favorite video game. When I first played this game, I had never played an RPG before. Now they are ny favorite genre. I love how facinating the whole idea of our mitochondria dominating us.And Aya is cool!BUY THIS GAME! The worst foe lies within the self......"
4,Great game but why so much??,"My sister bought this game when it first came out, and I have been wanting to buy some old PS games, preferably new, since I miss the old controls. But $125 bucks, really?? I mean it is a great game for its time, but not $125 bucks worth!!!"
3,Finished it in a weekend,"I love Square, yes I do, and so I usually love everything they develop and publish. Parasite Eve, although it had an interesting premise and a lot of promise really failed to deliver in that I finished the game in a weekend. There just isn't a lot of side stuff nor replay value, recommend renting before buying."
2,Not worth the money or time,"Although the game did not totally suck, I must say this title did not agree with me. The story was a let-down compared the other Square games. It was way too short, I finishied in about four or five days, not even sitting there on the couch for the whole time. The characters were boring and bland, so I had no feeling for them whatsoever. Then to top it off the story was not that much of a jewel either. I would not waste your money if I were you because this game does not feel like an RPG, it's almost a direct bite off RE. The only good thing was the FMVs"
2,Disappointment,"I got this game expecting a lot. I was very disappointed. But first the good. The game is innovative, being a departure from the standard RPG by Squaresoft. The battle system was a good attempt, but didn't work too well. The cinematic features of the game were not disappointing. The cut scenes were wonderful and the overall graphics were pretty good. The storyline was interesting as well.Unfortunately, that did not make up for the confusing nature of the game. The weapon modification system did not work well, and as I said before, the battle system did not end up being as good as it could have been. The gameplay was not immensely fun either.Call it my opinion, but I did not enjoy this game at all and couldn't wait to trade it in."
2,"Not bad, but not great","This game has an interesting storyline, and some good cinematic sequences, but I was disappointed with certain aspects. For instance, you aren't able to bypass the cinematic scenes....this can be annoying when re-doing a level multiple times. Also, most of the dialog is read-only (rather than spoken on the soundtrack). For a game with it all, I'd suggest Metal Gear Solid as a far more superior game."
3,Parasite Eve,This game was pretty disgusting. I didn't like it. Although it did have some pretty good secrets.1-10Graphics:10Gameplay:10Sound:7
1,Very poor.,"Too short, too easy, very boring, really. The storyline makes little sense and is rather inconsistant (to free the mitochondria... huh, really, bad attempt at bio sci-fi here), Aya is somewhat cool but pretty boring. The FMAs are almost all gratuitous, they very seldom have anything to do with actual story elements, and it seems Square relied only on that to sell the game. The graphic engine is good but poorly used: the pre-rendered backgrounds are no match for Resident Evil 2. If you want a good RPG, get Xenogears or Final Fantasy Tactics, but avoid this."
4,Would you walk faster?,"This game is pretty cool, but I think it could be better. First of all the main character needs to walk faster. It takes way too long to get somewhere. The graphics are amazing, as well as the sound. I look forward to getting the sequel and examine the changes."
5,A Great Game For Any Fan of RPG's,"Since Parasite Eve is a PS1 game, most people overlook it and consider itan outdated, boring waste of time. The people who consider playing the game, however, shall find that their choice shall be greatly rewarded! P.S.(Parasite Eve) has an awesome story line, a multitude of weapons and ""spells"", which are called Parasite Energy, and one of the most unique and strategy-based batlle systems I have ever seen! DO NOT OVERLOOK THIS GAME UNTIL YOU TRY IT! TRUST ME IT WILL BE WORTH IT!Ideliron"
4,High School Science Just Got More Interesting.,"I purchased this game solely on its amazing TV commercial. I never quite enjoyed Resident Evil, but this is more than mere clone. For instance:It incorporated real facts. Whole theory about Mitochondria Eve is well preserved and used very well to give otherwise straight forward storyline.Battle system is more RPG-like than action game. I've been playing RPG extensively, so this battle system came natural. Also, if you are not good at hand-on combat style, this battle system gives you breathing room to make your decision.It doesn't hurt to include gorgeous FMV, and preview disc.All told, this game is definately worth shot, at least for renting."
3,Far to short a game,"This game had a great combat system, where you could at a glance see what you could and couldnt attack. Images and short movies are some of the best I have seen in a game. Story was far easy to guess, but still original, and credit for that.BUT, my problem is this. I beat the game the first day I played it. It was far to short to ever get into it before it was over."
2,"Way too corny, no replay value, too repetitive, too easy.","Okay, so the graphics were really neat. Other than that, this game was barely worthwhile. I like corny storylines, but this one was way too corny. And I found myself having to seek out and beat the same idiotic baddies over and over again to get enough points to go to the next level, which was tedious. You also have to comb the same scenes over and over again to make sure you picked up all of the invisible weapon upgrades. But it wasn't challenging at all. Just redundant redundant. The background sounds were annoying and the dialouge was silly. I don't know why I bothered to beat this game. Now that I have, I don't have any reason to beat it again. I've seen all it has to offer, too many times!"
2,"Be a parasite and Leech this offa friend for a day,DON'T BUY","This game while pretty in some points suffers from some moments of stereotypical dialogue (cop moaning about his ex, kid and the rest of the world being less important than his job). I wish the encounters would have been a bit more open ended than the location oriented encounters in the early parts of the game. I like being able to bulk up a bit before a baddie"
3,Good at best...,CG the best other then FF8. Graphic are also pretty good. Story line has major potential but falls seriously short in all ways that matter. Also there is absoulutely no character development in the main character. But my major complaint is I beat the game in just 8 HOURS and after you beat it you don't feel like replaying it ever again. With the release of SaGa Frontier and Brave Fencer Musashi(Both Mediocre Games at best) i've just about lost faith in Square. If not for Xenogears I would have.
2,It is not as its picture,"It is not exactly the same as the picture, and it is almost big for a pencil case. all in all i found it very different from its picture. it is soft, and it dies not stand in a stily way. The kipling brand sewed on it is red while the pictures is black."
4,Excellent small cosmetic case,I bought this as a gift for my wife to organize her cosmetics for travel. It is excellent for small items such as lipstick and mascara pencils and applicators. She loves it.
5,Great,Bought the black one and it arrived on time and in great condition. Real great for stationary and cosmetics.
4,Pretty good product,"The only thing I'd like to see is better quality tape on the weights, otherwise you can't beat the price."
3,"Pretty thin, but some nice moments","""Assassins"" was one of Sondheim's biggest flops on the theatrical stage, and you'll know why when you hear it: although many of the songs are terrific, it's really not a show as much as a song cycle. It's overall point--that presidential assassins are just pursuing the American dream--is made in about the first five minutes, and you may wonder why it needs to keep going for so long, but there are some lovely, haunting numbers: ""The Ballad of Guiteau,"" ""The Ballad of Czolgosz,"" and the beautiful ""Gun Song"" (with its exquisite harmonizing)."
4,this show never got its due,"though uneven, this show should have had a longer run and the opportunity to find its audience. maybe it was simply ahead of its time. i think in the era of ""rent"" it would do better. ""unworthy of your love"" is one of sondheim's prettiest/creepiest songs. give it a try."
4,The recording is great...,"...but it actually works a lot better if you actually get to see the show. Assassins works. Not only is it emotionally gripping, some parts are downright hilarious! One thing I must say to the music fan from Pittsburgh: Something Just Broke is not on this recording because it was added later for the London production. I have been in and seen productions that decided not to use Something Just Broke. The song may be one of Sondheim's biggest mistakes. It doesn't work and it kills the flow of the show. I can not encourage people enough to go see a production of this show. If it weren't for September 11, this show WOULD be on Broadway right now. The only Sondheim on Broadway right now is a revival of Into The Woods (*YAWN*)."
5,very good despite its sycophants,"This is a great CD and a great show. It bugs me, however, that since it's become fashionable, de rigueur, among those who are really incapable of appreciating Sondheim to laud him, we are repeatedly subjected to ridiculous praise of his very worst songs. Below we find a case in point:>""I am unworthy of your love"" is one the most tuneful and melodic songs I have ever heard with a lovely melodyIn fact, the only excuse for this hackneyed music is that it is typical of quite of bit of seventies drudge (Fromme attacked Ford in 1975, and Hinkley attacked Reagan very early into the eighties) and Sondheim is consciously evoking throughout the play the evolution of American popular song (tranforming some of the same melodic motives). The lyric, of course, is ironic."
2,Sorry folks. This is a dud.,I am a big Sondheim fan -- but this score is laughable. Even the best have their misses. Also what a drag to have a lenghty monologue on a musical CD.
3,I Love Some of the Ballads,"The whole album is good but I would love to listen to the ballad with Patrick and Victor Garber over and over,etc."
5,Assassins is not about Assassins,"If you were paying attention at all throughout the music (or book, if the case may be) there are huge gaps in fact, not to mention blatant distortions of reality, throughout the entire show. John Wilkes Booth didn't shoot himself, he burned to death in the barn. The characters of Lynette Fromme and John Hinckley never met. John Wilkes Booth was not in the Texas School Book Depository. Do you see where I am going with this? Assassins is not about the individual, the very message that JWB ""preaches"" in the end is; without all of them, they are nothing. There is no individual. The show is about the whole state and nature of the Unhappy American. Or as I like to say, a metaphor."
1,An embarrassment for Mr. Sondheim.,"Hard to imagine this is the same composer that gave us COMPANY, SWEENEY TODD, et al. Lyrics are inane, and the CD includes a lengthy bit of dialogue that is no fun to listen to on CD. A real little stinker!"
1,Utter and complete garbage,"Were this CD not as unintentionally hilarious as it is, the only thing to do would be to throw it away. However, the music is so amateurish, the emoting so false and the libretto so ridiculous that you'll be smiling throughout. My favorite bit is the duet between John Hinckley and Squeaky Fromme. Classic farce. I also love the TERRIBLE sequence in which assassins from the past try to get Oswald to shoot Kennedy. A better target would be the CD player. This album is so awful that there are not enough words to describe it. Bottom line: it.... But what else could we expect from the poison pen of Sondheim?"
4,Amnesiac robotics expert discovers unknown city of robots,Excellent adventure and mystery serial. Good _clean_ science fiction
3,"If you love Asimov Robots, you gotta read it...","So, it may not be the best story ever written, but it does carry on the Asimov Robots storyline. If you can quote the three laws of robotics, you gotta read this whole series. It will not knock your socks off or anything, but you will enjoy it."
3,Bee Culture,"A good magazine. A little more for the pro than the hobbiest. No regrets, but would prefer something more geared toward the hobbiest."
1,Recommended for Nausea,"This is one of the worst games I've played in years. Yeah, the graphic stills look great, but just try playing the game for more than an hour. It has the most obnoxious 3rd person camera I've ever seen. It zooms in and out whenever it feels like it and you have no control over it. You would think that when the evil boss's gigantic super tank pops up to splatter you that the camera would shift so you can look at it, but nope. You get to fight most of your enemies off screen. Luckily, you are equipped with an auto tracking device that renders any aiming skills you may have useless, and makes it basically a dodge ball game with a plot. Sound like fun? Just wait until you're trying to track down that helicopter firing missles at you and the camera keeps zooming in and out and spinning! Yeah, it's cheap, but so is sticking your finger down your throat, and that's more fun. Save your money and buy something playable, like Grim Fandango, or The Sims."
5,one of my all-time favorites,"there are just some games that from the moment you start playing them, you love them. for me this is one of those games. i neverh heard of it before i bought it but i ended up getting hooked from the beginning. i actually lost my first copy of the game and ended up buying it again. this game is not one of those award-winners everyone has heard of or played, but as far as i'm concerned it is one of the most fun games around."
5,"Action, Intrigue and Plot Twists","This is the best Christian fiction novel I had read to date. The action, intrigue and plot twists keep the pages turning fast. The character development, set across the backdrop of ancient Rome, is first rate. Be prepared for any preconceived notions of ""Revelation"" to be compellingly challenged."
4,A huge step in the right direction.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is a page turner indeed. How refreshing to read a book that doesn't have to do theological summersaults to fit scripture and history into their own futuristic paradigm. Jesus is not a liar - He is the Truth.I hope this book is an eye-opener for believers and non-believers alike.Thank you Mr. Hannegraaf and Mr. Brouwer, keep up the good work. Perhaps you will set many readers free from the fear and anxiety that the doom and gloom authors portray. I also hope that your study in eschatology progresses as you diligently research the scriptures and history for these books. I know that my Preterist beliefs have positively changed my entire outlook on the future.I look forward to the next installment in the series.Sincerely,Mrs. Patricia GannLas Vegas, Nevada"
1,Just plain bad,"This is one of the worst books I have ever wasted my money on. The title and the cover description would lead you to believe it is about John or at least about possesing a copy of Revelations. It's not. The first 3/4 of the book just follows certain characters around without any hint of a plot. The final 1/4 finally starts to put together a plot, but then the book just comes to an abrupt end. Not a well crafted cliff hanger, it just ends like the author just got tired of writting. Even though the authors disagree with the Left Behind theology, they obviously are copying the strategy of stretching too little story over too many books in an attempt to deprive the readers of their hard earned money. I honestly don't care enough about the characters to pay for another poorly written book just to find out what happens to them."
2,Do not buy this on CD,"I am a big fan of HH radio program ( though our Christian station dropped him ). I also subscribe to his magazine.I like most of his books on CD however, I would not recommend TLD on CD. I had to listen to the first few chapters SEVERAL times as I was having a hard time following who was who because of the first century NAMES ! A visual would be much easier to keep track.I have gotten up to the 3rd CD ( of 11?) and I had to quit .Also , when I bought it , I thought it was going to be more of a teaching on end times. I didnt know it was going to be this big drama fictional thing.Does anyone feel up to running Hank's new belief on end times past me ?If you would, please email me at heygeno@webtv.netGeno"
3,"entertaining, but Incorrect","I truly enjoyed this book for the read, and found it well wrote compared to the long draggy left behind series, however although I have supported the Bibleman ministry in the past I am quite shocked by his view of the book of Revelations. Hanagraaf has decided that the antichrist has already came, as well as the tribulation during the time of Nero and before the fall of the temple. I do believe that there can be ""minor"" fullfillments of prophecy, I do not believe that scripture supports this view of the author. The tribulation is coming, the Antichrist will be revealed, however this book makes for a good and interesting read. I truly enjoyed it but totally discount his view."
3,"It is the best of books, it is the worst of books.","Simply stated, the book is marvelously conceived but pathetically executed. I'm thrilled with the concept and agree with its underlying theology, but the execution is pitiful. How did Mr. Brouwer ever become a best selling author? I'm afraid that the poor writing will cost it a place at the table in confronting the foolishness of the Left Behind series theology."
3,Cautious recommendation,"Set in the first century, and based on the book of Revelation (the 'Last Disciple' refers to John), this book offers a different take on the Tribulation than the Left Behind series. I find it interesting that both series are published by Tyndale House, especially considering the Afterword.That said, here are my thoughts: I felt this was a well written and intriguing book. However, there are so many characters and subplots that at times I (and this could just be me) was a bit challenged to keep it all straight. It well illustrates the excesses of ancient Rome and the abuse of power and corruption so common then. I appreciated the author's research and seeming understanding of the times.I can recommend this book; however, I don't feel that it's one I would personally care to re-read over and over."
5,Enjoyed Thoroughly,"Brouwer's writing style keeps you reading and the underlying plot is fascinating. Its unfortunate that only two books were ever produced in this series. The book takes a preterist view of the interpretation of the Revelation in Scripture, suggesting that it applied to the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple in AD 70."
3,"Refreshing, yet could be developed","This book has been an enjoyable read and is very refreshing when compared to the weird LaHaye books. However, I decided on 3 stars after pondering what others were saying about character development, plot, etc. Those areas were weak. Sort of reminded me of Perettis' Visitation. Peretti had 2-3 great books and then just deteriorated. The theology is extremely refreshing and really, really fits Daniel, Revelation, etc. I think more books can easily be written along this line of interpretation and ALL will be better than the rapture stuff."
5,A great read,"I was hesitant to read this, still having the bad taste in my mouth from trying to read the Left Behind series. This book, as well as its sequel The Last Sacrifice, are exciting reads that don't hit you over the head with the author's personal interpretations ever few lines."
1,Perennialism seems to be key to Revelation,"Made for enjoyable reading (4 stars). Belongs securely in Fiction section of bookstores and NOT dependable Theology (deduct 3 stars). It did not persuade me into Priorism. It did not adequately refute Laterism (LaHaye/Jenkins opinion). I can't say it was helpful in moderating the debate between Premillennial, Postmillennial, Amillennial frameworks.As much as the book tried to change minds, I remain a Perennialist: Revelation relates the Kingdom throughout time until Jesus returns on Judgment Day."
1,"ENTERTAINING AS FICTION, UNEDIFYING AS THEOLOGY","Good fiction? o.k. Gripping Theology? Not o.k. When I read Christian fiction, I look for solid Bible teaching as a storyline foundation: clear Gospel referencing, underlying power of God's truth in text's words, allusion or allegory or parable or symbolism to my Lord Jesus, and by the end of the book a sense of uplift or biblical edification. Regrettably, just not enough here to unambiguously point to Christ's Very Word."
2,"Refreshing Theology, Pointless Plot","I read this book thinking it would be on the level of one of the ""Left Behind"" end-times thrillers. While the theology is a refreshing change from the works of LaHaye and Jenkins, the writing quality is surprisingly poor. The plot rambles through the first three-quarters of the book, with ancient Roman names abounding and no real story unfolding. The pace does quicken at the end, but there is no real point made other than the Beast of Revelation being Nero.After reading this title, there is still a need for a top-notch, end-times thriller that presents an ""Exegetical Eschatology"" (a term mentioned in the author's afterword). The effort here is commendable, but the end result earns only two stars."
4,Better than Left Behind,"This is the first in an series of books based on the premise that the Bible book Revelation was written before the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD, and that, consequently, the Great Tribulation described in John's book actually occurred already in the first century AD. This is a very different interpretation than the one promoted in the Left Behind series of books, and it seems to be more likely true.The story includes a large cast of characters so it is not the type of book you can read slowly a bit at a time over a number of weeks (if you do, you'll start forgetting who some of the characters are). The story is intriguing, and will interest any who like historical fiction and any who want to find out more about an alternate interpretation of Revelation."
5,Time Travel Is Possible,"This is not an alternative country album, nor is this a new country album. This is pure, old school, honest-to-god country western music. While Case's later albums define the term ""alt.country"" and develop an alternate history for country western music, free from the influences of Nashville, this album is something else. This album is what gives Ms. Case the authority to redefine country music on her own terms.Because on this album, Neko Case proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that she is the equal of any country western singer of note. Had she been born a generation earlier, we would throw out her name the way we throw out names like Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn.Those who were introduced to Case by her later albums, released ater shed had some mainstream success --The Tigers Have SpokenorFox Confessor Brings the Flood-- may find this album off-putting, as the more lyrical and dark touches that define her later work are conspicuously absent here."
3,ok I must admit,My previous review was one star but after having listened to this cd more it has started to grow on me. Being from Vanc BC I have seen her punk rock outfit before and really enjoyed it as well as other groups they played with like Smugglers and Huevos Rancheros. And I sort of consider myself a local expert on the surf rock and garage rock stuff too but I had never heard her solo band. Funny enough I saw her solo band first time when my friends took me to see Southern Culture on the Skids and I was let down sort of because the energy of her old band was just not there but still I wanted to hear their disc. now the more I listen to this CD the more it grows on me. Like I've said the vocal delivery is good but it still needs something more. The Bowling Green track is the stand out.
2,Keep Looking,"For the cost, this book is 4 standard deviations from the mean of value. See, I learned something!In all seriousness, the book does accomplish what its sets out to do: Explain the most basic concepts in stats in rather plain language and without the supporting derivations and equations. But, in the end it is useless to anyone but perhaps a high school student looking for an introduction. It takes nearly one-quarter of the book to finally arrive at definitions of grade school topics such as means, medians, and modes.The treatment is so simple as to be insulting at times, and it lacks explanations of those topics that actually make stats complicated. Instead it sticks to simple half-baked explanations of topics that are simplistic to begin with."
4,Stats without Tears,"Love the book, but it was a little marked up and I think it said :""like new"" but I am not sure.GREAT resource for anyone who struggles with math or stats."
4,"Beautiful magazine, full of interesting things","I have been getting BBC History magazine for a few years now. I wanted to rebut the previous reviewer who had subscription problems. I did my renewal through Amazon in April 2007 and have no problems at all, and it was much cheaper (nearly half price) than through the BBC History subscription agent directly. I have never missed an issue, and it comes in a plastic wrapper so the issues don't get wet or damaged.The magazine is full of great, many 5-page articles on all topics of world history, not just UK. There are book reviews, articles on travel to historic sites and more. Many color illustrations, on heavy paper."
5,BBC History Magazine,"I've subscribed to this magazine for about 3 years after purchasing in on newstands. Everything stops when it arrives in the mail and it is the only magazine that I read cover to cover, even taking a stab at the puzzles and quizzes,though they are frequently too ""inside baseball"" (cricket?)for me. The issues do usually arrive late in the month, but it was the same on the newstand. And it's History, after all."
1,Response time too long!!!,"Why is Amazon asking me for a review when I haven't even seen this item yet? I love Amazon 's service and prices, but the time it takes to actually see the magazines that are ordered is WAY too long! At least wait until the first issue has been delivered to the customer before asking for a review!!"
4,amusing European monarchies,"This is a comedy very similar to the 3 musketeers,the difference being there is only one musketeer.The story is about a musketeer who likes womenbut does not want to marry and flees into army.There he should be save for the next 3 years,the remainder of the 7 years war ;).Actually the story is not very relevant.The movie is funny to me because of the jokes on theFrench king, the French army and European politics.(Some Americans will see this as France bashing *sigh*.)One joke is at the battlefield the French kingfails to remember what started the war and whichcolor uniform matches which country and on whichside they are fighting.Or an enemy spy rearranges the tin soldierson the Kings map to sabotage the battle of the next day."
3,Slight but still fairly enjoyable,"This 2003 remake of the much-loved Gerard Philippe original comes from the Luc Besson stable and has all the typical strengths and weaknesses that implies. It's nowhere near as bad as its disastrous Cannes reception implies, and Vincent Perez makes a good tongue in cheek lead, but the hugely extended action scenes - owing more to Jackie Chan films than traditional swashbucklers- come at the expense of a much-truncated plot and something of a loss of charm. It's not completely without wit, but it does tend to exhaust your goodwill somewhere around the halfway point."
2,Not Louis L'Amours best,"I have read just about every book written by Louis L'Amour. I started reading his work when I was about 12 years old, and now I am over 60 and still enjoy his stuff. I believe that this story must have beeen written in his early years and never published, because it wasn't good enough. After his death, I think his family must have taken all of his old unpublished work, and got it put into print based on his fame and success. These later books, including ""The Cherokee Trail"", just dont match up with his best stuff. I cut my teeth on the ""Sacketts"", ""Hondo"", and ""Heller with a gun"". This book just isn't in that league. On the plus side, however, it is still a worthwhile read. Since Louis is not around anymore, I guess I will settle for what I can get. His less than best is still better than the majority of the current Western writers out there."
3,Quinched my thirst,"I was on vacation in Arizona, and being out west left me with a very strong desire to read Louis L'Amour book. Luckly the local Library in Glendale AZ , Had this book for sale for a Dollar. It was exactly what I wanted, Good book. I give it three stars because, It is kind of unbelievable, I could have lived with the Man who raided their land back home, and was running for office, and she wanted to stop him. The fact that he also was the one who killed her husband??? Just little too far. Also it is kind of wierd she acts like she wants to hide from this guy but then tells everybody her real name, and tells them her life story??? That aside I really did like this book. My favorite story of his is the Iron Marshal"
3,The LP is MUCH better,"I bought the vinyl LP of this recording when it came out; THAT recording is OUTSTANDING. What happened when it went to digital (CD)? Why was it mixed differently? Some of the voices are placed so distant in the sound field as to be virtually inaudible. Aside from that, this is an excellent realization, in my opinion Tomita's best work, of an excellent composition."
1,Spike Jones Meets Mussourski,"The Textures are interesting, but musically it really misses the point. Very Hoaky, especially the sound-effect like effects. Mussourskis' original, especially the piano version, was very modern for its' time. This version sounds like a throw back to the 50s. Also lacks depth, or to put it more emphatically, very shallow interpretation."
2,Worthless for Word,"If you just want to switch from VB to C# and are looking for a good how to reference this is not the book for you especially as it pertains to Microsoft Word. There is a solid description and how to for the range object, but that's about it. Word's Bulleted/Numbered List object, arguably the most convoluted of them all, doesn't even get mentioned and tables are glossed over in barely 2 pages."
1,Worst prog book i have EVER read,"THERE IS NO CODE Download, you get to ALL THE DOCUMENTS YOUR SELF, I have read most of the word portion (that's why I bought the book) If I had written this book I would have created an integrated application. That's what office is all about right? I think this is a great egghead book, but for learning TERRIBLE.Pass on this, wait for the wrox book; even if it sucks, I am sure it would be better than this. AW would you like me to write a book? I can bang out something more practical in a weekend!M~"
3,"Good Game, Mediocre Simulation","On the plus side: great graphics, good track models, handling is fairly believable.On the other hand, the damage model is frighteningly bad. Run you car into a wall at 170 miles per hour, and you get a message which says, ""You're wing is bent! Come in and we'll fix it.""I also got annoyed at the fact that even playing on the expert level, this game is hard to lose. Also, almost every time I am running second, the leader blows up in front of me, even with failures turned off!One other nit to pick: They boast that ""Now you can play the 2000 season at the beginning, instead of waiting until the season is over"". Only problem is, we don't know how prone to failure a given car is or how well a driver is going to perform until the season IS over.Final complaint: I went to EASports' website to complain about this, but couldn't find a feedback line or e-mail spot anywhere.On the whole, I am fairly disappointed with this ""greatest racing sim of the year"""
3,F1 2000,"F1 2000 is a great game, but could be MUCH better. Graphics and sound are great. Options make the game interactive (car set up, fuel strategy). Draw backs are, when qualifying if you get pole, no other driver can beat that time, so you don't have to compete for 'P1'. Also, any car that is in front of you always has some mechanical failure within a few laps. Usually an engine failure will remove the car in front, even when you set ""failures"" and ""Damage"" to off. This can be very frustrating since little 'racing' actually occures. I called Tech support and they were of no real help."
2,Janet Dailey disappoints in this book,"I usually love Janet Dailey books because I'm a ranch girl in California but this heroine is just too stupid to belong to us. Maybe she can do tricks on horses (no big deal, really) but she is just dumb. There's no identification with her on my part and the story is a simple conflict of a bully and his target. I'm disappointed."
3,Six white horses Oklahoma By.Janet Dailey,As. A young rodeo performer patty misplaced her love for an older cowboy and followed him throughout most of her career instill.she discovers she. Is in love with a cowboy she cannot stand..
3,Good read but not one of her best,"I like Janet Dailey's earlier books because she spends more time developing her characters. This book while a pleasant read, is not one of her better ones. The characters spend too much time trading barbs with each other and this became boring after a while. Any author can have a book that misses the mark and this maybe one of them."
2,What a disappointment!,"With Boney M.'s big selling Christmas album from 1981, producer Frank Farian recorded six new Christmas songs with Liz Mitchell and Reggie Tsiboe (who'd replaced dancer Bobby Farrell in 1982) in the summer of 1984; they were, however, only released at the time on a South African LP, but when Boney M. had split up in 1986, Farian wanted to keep the kettle boiling and dug out these disappointingly mediocre recordings, remixed the whole 1981 album but two songs, and released the whole mess in November 1986. And the result is awful! Get the original ""Christmas Album"" instead (it is available on CD) when you want to get in a Christmas mood, this CD sounds as supermarket muzak ..."
5,Very strong voices and spine-chilling harmony.,"I happened to hear a sound bite from this CD on the radio - what an amazing sound! Some songs are rendered in a somewhat ""calypso-style"", which is generally not my favorite style, yet this has become my favorite Christmas album. You will love this music."
3,Just OK.,"Delivery from Amazon was fast & efficient, but the album was a disappointment. I guess I paid $12 to get the song I wanted (Mary's Little Boy Child/My Sweet Lord) because the rest were either unappealing or very so-so."
5,Review of CD purchase,No problems at all -- item was received in a timely manner and in good condition.
3,"A good, quick read","""Dagger"" is an above average modern-fantasy/occult novel that you can polish off in a few hours. It's a bit like an old episode of ""Columbo"" -- you already know whodunnit, watching the good guys unravel the bad guys' plans is where the fun is.The dialog is a little hokey (Peregrine's new wife tells him that their lives are ""inextricably entwined"" -- I'm almost 30 years old and have never said the word ""inextricably"" out loud). Also, ""Dagger"" would flow a little better if the author didn't stop to describe what kind of car everyone drives or the accent (or lack thereof) of the head bad guy. These are minor quibbles, though, and shouldn't stop you from reading it, especially if enjoyed the first three books in this series."
3,A minor improvment to the series,"This is the third book on The Adept series and it is finally one that can be read without yawning. I wouldn't call it a late-night-turn-the-pager as advertised but is more interesting then the previous books. A major disapointment, starting in book two, is the fact that the developing relation between Adam/Ximena and Pergegrin/Julia is reduced to a few sentences where the reader is informed that something is going on. Especially with Adam where we are told in an entire! paragraph about a relation that is supposedly going on for over a year. In Peregrins case we are suprised with the fact that they are marrying. I would have expected more interaction between the characters prior to engagement. Especially as the plots dragged on and there would have been ample room for that. At least this book has an interesting prologue and Peregrin gets a bit more involved than only being the servant of Adam. Even if it is only at the beginning, but it is a start."
2,It's a real disappointment,"I just wanna say that I absolutely LOVE Garbage, and I adore both of their albums.However, this single was just totally disappointing. When I Grow Up is a great song, but it's the only great song on the single. ""Tornado"" is seriously the worst Garbage song I have ever heard. I didn't think it was possible to write a bad Garbage song. The ""Special"" remix didn't do anything for me either, it bored me after a while.Only get this single if you collect Garbage stuff, because unless you are a MEGA fan, it's just not worth it, and you're better off buying the ""Special"" single so that you can hear a REAL Garbage B-Side."
2,The B-side is terrible,"There can be no question that ""When I Grow Up"" is an excellent track, one of the better ones on Version 2.0, but do yourself a favour and buy the other WIGU single instead of this one. Tornado is not just bad, it is very bad. I hate to say it, but I'm not sure I'd even class it as music. Previous singles have been well worth buying for the B-sides alone, but I can't see any reason to recommend this single over the other WIGU."
1,buyer beware,"i bought this diaper pail when my daughter was born and i've had nothing but trouble. the lid fell apart and it leaves a (poop) odor into the baby's room. the odor neutralizers don't work and i bought new one's and they don't work i've tried lysol, baking soda and other odor neutralizers in and around the diaper pail with no end to the horendous odor in sight."
2,Doesn't do the job,"The advantage I thought with this was that it did not require any special bags. While this is true, and it is an advantage, you still have to change out the bag daily, because it doesn't do the job of keeping odors at bay. You won't save a lot of money: you'll spend probably as much on regular trash bags as you would on proprietary bags (as with a Diaper Genie)."
1,Diaper genie is better,"I purchased this when our 6 year old diaper genie broke and I didn't think we needed to invest in a new DG since my son is potty training. Diaper genie does a much better job of containing the odor. Yes, you don't need to buy the refills but you have to remove the bag for each poopy diaper and put in a fresh bag and spray lysol and oust and that can get expensive. If I don't then the whole house smells (I have a big house!) and then I have to burn scented candles! So it's not really a money saver in my opinion. I also don't think it would be practical for a newborn because a new mom can't run up and down stairs each time the baby poops.If sonny doesn't potty train soon I might get something else and this diaper pail might end up in the garage to contain the doggy scoop!"
1,diaper pail,"This product arrived with a part missing. There is supposed to be an inner liner, which holds the liner in place. I had this same problem when buyng this product from Wal-Mart. I bought one on line since then, and was perfectly happy with it. I did not try to return it, as I could't wait that long, and I was lucky enough to have the inner liner from the old one, which could no longer be used, because the spring inside broke after long usage."
4,Works great for us:),"I really like this diaper pail. Great price and so far (my baby is 6 weeks) we have no odor escaping. Granted--each time I change the bag I completely sanitize the pail---hot, hot water with lysol. It only take a few minutes and it only makes sense to sanitize something that sits in your precious child's room just holding waste. I too like the fact that I do not have to go buy ""special"" refills for it. I figure diapers cost enough as is---why spend a bundle getting rid of them once they are ready for the trash?!"
1,Doesn't last.,I have three major problems with this product.1) The bags are hard to change because the lid doesn't stay open while you are trying to change them.2) The small lid where you are supposed to put the diapers in does not open anymore because the springs broke.3) The pail does not reduce any of the odors from the diapers.
1,Might as well be a garbage can,"We received this as a gift, and threw it away after two weeks with our newborn. It did not keep any of the smell in, and the clamping mechanism on the inside that is supposed to help contain the stench would not stay closed at all around the bag. We are much happier with our Diaper Champ!"
1,hate it,I got this pale b/c it was cheap. Yes you can use any bag for it but it doesn't hide the smell and the lid slams down on its own almost catching my fingers while I'm changing the bag. So unless you like a smelly house and have 3 arms to change a bag dont buy!!
3,New design is inferior to previous version,"I got one of these as a gift three and a half years ago and bought another now that I'm expecting a second child. The old version had an inside flap system that closed the trash bag together once I pushed the diaper through, helping to contain odors. The new version is exactly the same, but there's no inside flap--the bag just stays open inside the pail. We never had much trouble with odor before, but I am skeptical about the new version."
4,"easy to use, does the job","We wash our diapers daily which is probably more effective at odor control than the little disc that rattles around every time we open the pail. Although a foot pedal would probably have been a better mechanism for opening and closing the lid, the push button is effective and not too cumbersome."
2,absorbs odor,"I have used this diaper pail for fifteen months now, about half of the time without the use of the inner plastic flaps that the diapers go through since two of the springs broke. I like that it uses regular trash bags and it does an OK job of containing odors (I have yet to hear of one that really contains it all.) But my complaint is that the thing absorbs and stores odors! It smells worse than any diaper ever did! I have tried bleaching it out, adding deodorizors to the little compartment in the lid, lysol wipes, air freshener spray, everything I can think of and the thing absolutely reaks! I think my son's diaper stinks, but then I open the diaper pail...even freshly cleaned and emptied with a brand new bag!"
4,Cheap and it works,"We have used this pail for 3 years, and 2 kids. The advantage is that this pail doesn't require any special bags. We change out the bag twice a week. You save a lot of money if you get sheap bags at Dollar Tree or Big Lots (works out to about 10-cents a bag). It does get stinky sometimes, but all garbage pails do and every child has an extra stinky diaper occasionally. Roll with it and save money when and where you can."
3,it's ok.... nothing special,"It's nice when you put the diaper in the top, you don't have to push it down with your hand, the lid does that when you close it. That's what first attracted me to this. You can only smell it when it's opened, other than that you don't really smell the diapers, thank God. But the 2 little blue flaps just inside the pail keep falling off. So that really sucks because you then have to stick your hand into the pail to get them out and put them back on. personally I don't like having my face so close to the diaper pail so I stopped using it."
1,STINKY!,"In the past, I rated a diaper pail that required expensive refills. In the review I stated to go for a pail where you can use your own bags...that's what had done. All was well for a couple of months. Our diaper changing area was on the first floor in the laundry room. We put a changing pad on top of the dryer so we wouldn't have to run upstairs all the time to change diapers (we had 2 children in diapers at the same time)...well soon we started to notice an odor and it didn't go away. We came to realize that the pail itself was absorbing the odors and we could not get rid of the stench no matter how much we washed it. Now we just use an ittby bitty garbage can that holds about 5 diapers and we empty it out every day...that's the only way to keep the diaper smell out of the house."
2,Not worth it for any amount of money,"We bought this diaper pail because of price and I did not want one with inserts, had the genie and hated it, had to push diapers down and most the time they didn't fit anyway. This diaper pail broke the first month. The dome that the deoderizer fits in broke and then the lid stopped staying closed. We had to put a toy on top of the pail to keep the lid down. The pail does not keep the smell in, so I bought seperate small bags to wrap each diaper in before we put it in the pail and the pail still smelled. Tried bleaching the pail and that worked for a day or two but then the it smelled even after just two days of diapers. Good luck finding the perfect diaper pail."
3,"Passes the test, barely","I have two children, and I decided to try a new diaper pail after the first two types I had used the past 3 years did not withstand repeated use. I love the fact that this pail uses regular garbage bags, which was the primary reason i decided to try it. I have been using this pail for several months now with my 16 month old son, and after about 2 weeks, detected a stench that was hard to remove. I change the bag about every 2-3 days, so the diapers do not sit in there too long. But even after washing the pail with several types of cleaners, soaking in bleach and letting it ""breathe"", it smells like used diapers are still inside. Overall, i would not purchase again, but it's not serious enough yet to toss out. Then again, in another few weeks/months, i may get to that point."
1,Broke in less than 6 months. Twice.,"We bought these diaper pails because they use regular garbage bag and are fairly inexpensive. We have 1 year old twins, so we go through A LOT of diapers and controlling the stink is important. This trash can did a lot better than the regular kitchen step can (that we purchased to replaced it) at controlling the stink. The step can did fine when the lid was closed, but every time it was opened, WHEW it was gross. That was not the case with these can. The problem with these cans is that with regular wear and tear, the spring on the lid snapped. Twice. Rendering it unusable (unless you want to open the whole can each time which defeats the purpose). The first time it happened the twins were six months old. We thought maybe it was a fluke. The second time it happened was a few weeks before their first birthday. Same exact problem: snapping spring. Total bummer because I am not interested in the fancy/wasteful diaper genies."
3,It does the job but....,I've owned this diaper pail for almost 2 years and I originally got it because I could use regular trash bags and not special refill bags that get expensive and just add onto you baby expense. Unfortunately this diaper pail does not keep the smell in very well. It does fine for the first 10 to 15 diapers but after that the smell is just horrible. Sometimes I feel like I just have to hold my breath just to be in the room.I'm expecting my second child and I am planning on getting a brand new diaper pail.The First Years Clean Air Diaper Disposal SystemI plan on purchasing The First Years Clean Air Diaper Pail because you can still use regular trash bags and it comes with a filter and fan to keep the smell down.
2,Not too happy this time,"We had the same pail with our first kid. It sustained for 1.5 years and then despite changing the odor remover, it was not very effective. However, we thought it performed quite well for a cheap pail. However, when we bought our second pail, we were not too happy. It doesnt close properly and keeps opening with a loud noise at times (some times an hour after closing)."
1,This diaper pail is WORTHLESS,"I have been using this diaper pail for a year now and it is simply worthless... you might as well buy a normal trashcan to dispose of diapers. This pail does NOT contain odors! As my little guy has moved from breastmilk to solids... his diapers have become more and more smelly and this ""diaper pail"" has not served it's purpose.PLEASE DO NOT SPEND THE MONEY TO BUY THIS... you may as well buy a normal trashcan- it DOES NOT conceal the smell."
3,Its a diaper pail thats now stored on the deck,"The diaper pail works good if you change the bag every day, but so does the trash can. We have tried various air freshener's in its compartment with no luck... It does hold a good amount of diapers and has a locking lid so its good for the deck. Another thing - the price has nearly doubled in 2 months?"
1,lid leaks the aroma,"Although the price is great, and you can use any bag you want, the lid doesn't close tightly. Thus, the aroma from inside contents leak thru, resuilting in unpleasant odor. I had to return it the day after I bought it."
4,fairly decent product for the price,This is nothing more than a trash can (plus a Deodorizer container).Pros:- uses any trash bag (no refills)- Easy to use- Deodorizer container is nice.Cons:- bit noisy when opening.
5,Lovely cross-label Collection,"This is a wonderful heavy on the Blue River collection. If you want to introduce a friend to Eric, this would be the place to start! If you collect yourself, it's rather over-priced but his captions about each song do make it worthwhile. Dan Folgelberg fans shouldn't miss this one, either, as Dan's backing vocals are lovely."
1,Poor Quality CD & Book,"How can you mess up a classic story, you ask? Easy. Have a horrible CD with poor production values, laughable sound effects and terrible acting accompany a well-illustrated book that looks like it was printed in someone's garage. My toddler loves read-along books and we thought this series might be the answer for us. Nope! Hugely disappointing"
2,gets clogged way to easily,"Maybe it's just me, or maybe it's the type of grass I have, or maybe it's the amount of tree roots running through the grass, or maybe it's because the soil it too wet, or too dry, or too sandy, or too clayish. I don't know. But I do know that when trying to use this on 600 sq ft of lawn, I had to stop and clean out the holes a couple dozen times. And it's not easy to clean them out. Takes a combination of screwdriver + hose. This quadrupled the amount of time it should have taken. Perhaps if they had tapered the holes a bit more it would have been ok?"
4,"If you have the right soil, this thing will work well","Length:: 2:51 MinsHere's how this thing works. It's definitely a workout, but it gets the job done in my clay soil (only when it's wet though)."
3,Good but not Great,"One side worked great the other side constantly plugged up. Got the job done and will keep it to use again, but disappointed that one side didn't work properly."
3,Ok Aerator,"Works good for its price. Could be a little more solid for my likeing, after first use already saw some curve on the prongs."
2,Good for 5 Minutes,"I purchased the Hound Dog to help with a few bare spots in my lawn. For the first 5 minutes it worked perfectly. I was able to aerate a small area pretty quickly, but then the clogging started. I would remove the clog (which is not easy at all) and then start up again only to get another clog shortly after. I thought that maybe I was getting clogs because the soil was too moist and I decided to try it again on a dryer day only to get the same result. It seems that the clogs can be caused by grass or grass roots as well as moist soil, so unless you are working on an area that has never had grass and at the perfect moisture, you will get frustrated with the clogs. I should have listened to the people who said that this tool was not worth the money instead of those who praised it."
4,This helped my lawn!!!,"This product worked well for me. It was a good amount of manual labor on my part, but worth it. My yard looks great and you can tell the aeration helped compared to last year. A friend of mine got a different brand that had a better (softer) handle. But it had a single post down the middle instead of two. This one is alot better to use than that one cause you knee doesn't hit the middle every time you step. Make sure to have gloves and maybe a piece of foam. Your hands do get sore after a while. Also, it does take a while but you do get into a groove. (Make sure you wet your lawn down really good the night before you use it)."
5,Does well for my yard!,"First off, my yard is has a very high percentage of sand so I was hoping this product would work well for me as the lawn I inherited when I bought my house two years ago is very very compacted. So far I have done half my yard and I am completely happy with this product. As a professional geologist I would not recomend this product for clay based soils, I have not tried it out on that soil type but my experience playing in the dirt tells me it would very frustrating and the cores would never eject. As for sandy soils such as mine it ejects the cores just fine. I am very glad I purchased this product."
5,great for a small yard,"I've never aerated my yard because it is just too small to be worth renting a machine, etc. This little tool does the job and does it well. Highly recommend it. Easy to use, all you do is step on it and plugs come up. All the garden books state that aerating with plugs (not just holes as in made with spikes) is the first step to a healthy lawn. After planting seed i'm looking forward to seeing what it looks like next Spring."
4,Very good.,"Built good! I was concerned it might not be heavy duty enough, but has strong welds and the piping is thick and strong enough that I am not worried about it breaking or bending. I weigh about 185 and probably just heavy enough to get it to sink all the way.After 10 mins of aerating, its a bit of a workout. Cleans out pretty easily. Recommend this little guy for small(er) areas."
2,Hound Dog Core Aerator,I purchased as an upgrade from the regular aerator thinking a coring model would be more beneficial. Come to find that it requires the right medium to work properly. unless your lawn is the right moisture it will either; not penetrate or impact quickly. So perfect conditions are required. I went back to the regular aerator. Good luck predicting your lawn hardness between watering.
4,Does the job,After realizing that I would have to rent a truck in addition to the mechanical aerator I looked to see if there was a suitable alternative and came across this item. I'll keep it brief. It works well if you apply even pressure and head the warning not to use in moist soil. It made from heavy gauge steel and the welds around the tubes appear to be hand done. I examined several before I found one that had a consistent weld bead around the top and bottom of each tube i.e. no welding slag. Overall I'm very satisfied with this tool.
4,good for a manual device,"pretty good little tool. my sprinkler system is rather shallow (due to our rocky soil), so a motorized aerator was not an option. (besides, they are quite heavy & difficult to navigate). the Hound Dog is a good tool for a smaller yard. one caveat: read the brief instructions - as stated, it will NOT work if your soil is too dry or too wet. since my yard had never been aerated, my soil was very compacted. so the aerator became sometimes got plugged. however, it worked very well for most of the job."
4,It plugs,"Pretty easy to use. I had some difficulty with one side getting plugged more frequently than the other. It could have been because my soil was too moist. Make sure to clean out plugs when they occur otherwise you'll pack it in, making it very difficult to get out."
2,Aerator Fails,Concept is good but unfortunately the soil jams in the cones and has to be cleared too often. Design needs a re-work and fully tested before going back to a market. This product will eventually go broke without design changes.Hound Dog Products HDP3-8 Turf Hound Aerator (Purchased on 03/07/2010)by Hound Dog
4,do it yourself,If you are a do it yourself type person. This is for you. It works well for a small yard. The holes tend toget clogged up from time to time. Roots get impacted and you have to stop and clean it out. Can get a littlefrustrating.
4,Hound Dog to the rescue,"The Hound Dog turf aerator is very simple to use. You can practically walk with it held in your hands and a foot on the hound dog and cover a large area rather quickly. The only problem I found was roots. Roots can clog it up very easily, tree roots that is. Keep a half inch stick handy to unclog it. I doubt it will ever wear out.JL"
1,"Great idea, but...","Mine also clogged after the first row (about 30 plunges). I unclogged it and tried again, but the cores did not pop out. First it was one side that was clogged then the other side about 10 times later.The reason for the few stars, is because I called the company on their 100% guarantee, several times, left 2 messages and have yet to get a response."
4,Good work out tool,"I purchased this product to aerate my lawn at my convenience and for it's size. Small fits anywhere in my shed and very light...I hated having to rent those big gas aerators twice a year. I've aerated my lawn twice and had my daughter do it once as well. It is a good workout...which I enjoy, and I'm saving money on those gas contraptions. The aerator works best if you lean left and right as you step down, and the clay plugs that come out seem to already help my thatch. Also, make sure you work with this device after a good rain, it helps when the soil is wet."
3,soil aerator,"Does what it does well, but it is a labor intensive tool and other, more expensive, solutions exist."
1,Wanted to love it...but after buying 2...products stinks,"Ignore the high ratings and don't buy any product which has so many 1 start ratings. So, who couldn't want a product by a company named Hound Dog, where a live person answers the phone, and which doesn't pollute the air, and is cheap to boot.Sigh, well I guess that would be me now. Yep, bought 1, product plugged repeatedly, and upon calling customer service (very nice but...) tried the 'maybe it's the soil type'..? Me...well, then why does only 1 cylinder get plugged? Her: maybe it's defective. I returned, they sent another....same problem. Lousy, lousy design. Save your $.L"
1,clog all the time!,"not sure if it's the lawn or the tool itself. One side it works fine, the other side always clog up! one step, un-clog, another step, un-clog again.. frustrating!!it's strange that only 1 side works.."
5,Wanna know what the 70's sounded like??? Dig this...,"Great instrumental LP from K.C. & Rick Finch...and The Sunshine Band. This band is totally underrated...tight horns, bass, guitar..too bad they are only known for the mainstream ""disco"" hits...check out ""Miss B"", ""Hey J"", ""Rock Your Baby"", awesome funky grooves. I love this LP...super psychedelic album cover...I miss those days....this LP is all good jams, dance the night away...just listen and you'll hear what i mean."

2,What?,"Not sure if its because its PC or what but this game has not impressed me control wise. It's what the game has been known for and I am deeply disappointed. I've used the Logitech controller as well and the control in this game compared to FIFA 06 is atrocious. I'm putting it down to the PC, footie games should obviously be played on consoles because I loved the MLS game Konami put out on the Playstation 1 back in the day. Reaction time is HORRIBLE! A deeply annoying game especially since I spent the time to make every team real and players real since Konami won't pony up for the licenses. In the immortal words of Farley......AAAAAAAngry."
1,Useless without the solutions.,"The idea of a workbook to be used in addition to the textbook seemed like a great idea. Too bad it was so poorly implemented. There are no solutions to any of the problems. To my way of thinking, not to provide positive feedback to the student makes the thing useless. If your instructor does not use the workbook or review it in class DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"
3,Be careful what you order!,"It was ok as a onetime use but the materials will not hold up to repeated use. If you plan on using this multiple times go with a copper one. Delivery was quick, though and it met the need."

4,Excellent - everyone should read,"I found out about this book in my sociology class. My teacher gave us a xeroxed chapter to read about how every man for himself. It is so true.. Our society is very ""wild"" and we need to pay attention to what Mr. Derber has to say. This is from the man in the street up to the corporate, and even to the country's executive level that controls our laws. I am also reading Derber's book ""In pursuit of Attention"". His books are easy to read and offer much insight to what our society has become. The main point of his book is.. we need to pay attention, discover who we really are, and learn how to survive in a world that really does not play by our own rules. And understand, we need to do something about the animals that manifest our society. Read it yourself.. you will be enlightened as to what really is happening..."

4,John Patrick's final book before his death!,"The annual ""Best of the Superstars"" series has been a mainstay of John Patrick and his StarBooksPress, providing a review of male idols and stars in TV, legit film, print ads and porn. And this 2002 is no different, with an excellent review of ""who is gay"" gossip for the year, the sexy stars of ""Queer As Folk"", those so-sexy A&F; models, as well as trends in gay porn on video, DVD and the internet. It includes a directory of gay escort and other porn website URLs.What sets this edition apart is that it was the last effort of John Patrick (author/editor of hundreds of gay porn books, anthologies and short stories) before his death, which could cause this to become a bit of a collector's item in the near future. Unlike most of StarBooksPress output, this annual series is never reprinted, meaning there is a limited number of copies available out there. Definitely a ""keeper."""

1,Verry bad wannabe movie,"They sad that it was the best looking dv-movie untill now. But it's verry amateurish, pretencious, badlooking and above all; boring."
1,"Looks cool, performs fair","I received this shaver as a Christmas gift, and returned it within a week. I have used Norelco shavers for 20 years, but this one is poorly designed. First, the trimmer is short and cuts your hair when you try to trim your sideburns. Second, the blades are not replaceable, so you have to replace the whole head assembly. Third, the cleaning system is bulky, and cumbersome. What ever happened to the simple Norelco technology: open the head, brush them out, and replace the blades when the shave gets poor. This design is made to attract, but the shave is no better than the Norelcos I have had for years. I'm back to my old Norelco now."
5,Norelco 1050 Artic Shaver,"I got my 1050 Artic shaver for Christmas. I've been using it for a week. I realy like it. It shaves faster, better and it gets into the hard to get places much easer. I read several reviews after it was orded some good and some bad so I wasn't shure about it. But after 1 week I am very happy with it.A Satisfied Customer"
1,Strike Out for Norelco,I am a long time Norelco user. This one looks good but performs bad. Misses softer hairs and does not shave close. I had to shave with a blade at least once per week to supplement the Arcitec. You have to wash it very frequently because the reservoir for stubble is non existent. I went back to my old Norelco and will be hesitant to buy another. By the time I contacted Norelco to execute the warranty it was too late (warranty is 3 mo.)
3,Not Bad ..Not Great,Overall this is an OK shaver. However it is not as good as my old Braun 7505. Not as close a shave and if you are not careful you will encounter razor burn. Many of the reviews tout how much better this is than the older Norelcos. If that is the case I am sure glad that I have been a Braun user. The biggest plus is the ability to rinse the head with water.
4,Great Razor,This is a great razor but you should upgrade to the 1090 if your boyfriend/husband likes to have warning of how much time is left until it needs to be charged again.
2,"Overrated, Don't Fall for Sleek Design","Guys,This thing is way overpriced and simply does not deliver a ""breakthrough"" performance like Norelco claims.... I have used the 1050 now for 4 weeks, and i have to make way too many passes with the thing to get my neck sufficiently. Which, in the process gives me more irritated skin after shaving. The sideburn trimmer really is bad, I am not nit-picking here.Either drop down a model and save some $$$$$ or go with a Panasonic. I have had like 3 Panasonics and they rock."
1,Not as good as the older Norelco design.,I've used Norelco for over 30 years and found the Arcitec to be: (1.) Noisier (2.) Does not offer enough weight and support for that comfortable massage of the face while shaving. (3.) Easier to clean but you have to clean more often. (4.) Shave quality the same as the older design and trimming function has always been just adequate which means you should use a razor afterwards in certain areas. (5.) Charging stand does not offer any additional benefit and miss being able to put a cord directly into the razor. (6.) I worry about long term repair costs and reliability vs. the older style.
1,Norelco's missed it this time,"This is my fourth Norelco electric shaver, and frankly I'm totally disappointed in it. After 20 minutes of shaving, I just have to give up. I have a medium-to-light beard, and this shaver won't shave me. At first, I thought it would take awhile to acclimate to my beard, but after trying for several months now, I'm giving up and going back to my old Norelco Spectra which works fine thank you. When I contacted Norelco they were of no assistance: they blew me off. Norelco can do much better: the Arcitec will be my last Norelco."
5,Excellent Product,I have used this for two weeks and am very pleased with the shaver. I have used Norelco shavers for 30 years and this one is by far the best.
2,just OK,I have used electric shavers for many years. It seemed that the design of this product should yield a better shave than traditional designs but it did not
3,Can't clean it!,"I bought this razor because I thought it would be an improvement over my old Norelco. Wrong! To get a close shave you have to use Lectric Shave lotion and it is impossible to clean because you can't remove the cutting blades from the heads like you could with the old Norelcos. And, there is not a good solution to this problem on the internet and the manual is no real help."
4,"A better shaver, nice close shave",I read a lot of the reviews and had some reservations about this productTurns out that this shaver works great for me and my beard.My beard = medI almost thought the first shave was too close but now I am getting comfortable shaves.I own a trimmer set so the small trimmer isn't a problem.http://www.amazon.com/Philips-Norelco-G480-Premium-Grooming/dp/B0016BN4YQ/ref=pd_sim_hpc_2Bottom line is this product works for me and my beard and I'm getting better shaves.You be your own judge as everyone beard is different.I would recommend this product to a friend.
2,Worst Shaver Norelco has ever made!,"I own this shaver and wish I would have taken it back but waited too long. Its the worst shaver Norelco has ever made. It doesn't cut good and leaves hairs everywhere. Plus, it leaves a mess all over your clothes as the heads can barely collect all the trimmed hairs. I had to switch back to my Norelco Spectra razor, which wasn't great but did the job better than this Arcitec razor. The best shave I got was after I changed the blades out but only lasted a month. I hear good things about Braun foil shavers and will probably purchase one of these. Don't waste your money!"
3,shaver,I am disappointed in the shaver. I expected a closer shave. I have to keep pressing to get a shave.Philips Norelco Speed 8240 Men's Shaving System
3,Some Problems,"On the favorable side, the razor does a good job. The problems involve the battery. Initially it took many hours to charge the battery. Also, even though the razor is cleaned after each shave, it gets hot when used."
1,Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men's Shaver,This a very poor product. It does not shave close. The head lasted about two months and I was told by a Philips agent that the head was not covered by the warranty but I could get a $5 rebate if I bought a replacement head. Since I could not shave without a replacement I bought a replacement head. This one lasted one month before not working. Also Philips did not honor the rebate. I have bought a Panasonic shaver which shaves much closrt and has lasted much longer. Good luck if you buy a Norelco arcitec 1050.
3,Not so great for me,"This is a great product but it doesn't really work that well for me.This product is for people with beards that are not thick or coarse. I have a very thick beard and it just doesn't get everything. The reason for this is because my facial hair is curly and it tends to ""lay down"" as the razor goes over it and not get cut.I typically will use an electric razor to trim it to short, use this razor to get most of what's left and then use a foil head to get it to be even/where I like it.The razor does do a good job when I've already trimmed my hair but if it's more than say... 5 or so days of growth I simply can't use it without wasting a ton of time.I'd recommend it to people with slow-growing and/or patchy beards."
5,Solid Razor,"I am a Norelco man. This razor is nice. It is built solid, has an amazing battery life, and shaves pretty good. I only recharge it about once a month. It does take slightly a few more passes when shaving than my older Nivea Norelco, but it is not a deal breaker. It does clean the neck very well, plus the trimmer is a lot better than other Norelcos I have tried out. It looks sleek and has a nice stand. I don't work for Norelco, just want to stand up for Norelco since I feel it is a good product. What are people with negative reviews doing wrong with this razor? I have had it for over two years with no complaints."
4,a really close shave,"Got this for a gift earlier this year. Would never spend so much on a razor but I now understand why people do. Great shaver. Easy to clean. Close shave. Cool look. Most people are familiar with the Norelco design by now, which has different heads pivoting individually to really get the contours of your face. This one does that and then some. Better than other Norelcos I have used in the past, although this may be because it's a higher-priced, better razor.I'm knocking off a star because I feel the price is a bit high for what it does. Razors at 30% of this cost do just about the same thing."
2,Not all that great,"I have owned several other Norelco Razors in the past and this one just doesn't work as well. It gives you a very uncomfortable shave, misses areas all together, and doesn't work nearly as good as their previous razors. Also - you basically have to clean it every day which is an awkward process because you have to individually lift each razor head and wash it out. Fortunately, this razor got lost on a cross country flight so I am now forced to spend money on something else. Sadly - good riddance!"
1,Lasted 13 Months,"I bought this razor on Sept. 11th 2010 and it died this morning. No lights, no charge, nothing. I don't recommed this product, obviously."
5,Great but not perfect,"This razor does provide the closest shave I have ever had from an electric razor. It is especially good on the neck. Cleaning is simple, and recharging only takes 1 hour. A symbol lights up to indicate you need recharging well before you lose power, so I don't believe I'll ever have the experience of running so low on power that I can't comfortably finish shaving.There is one serious design flaw that should be noted. The mustache and sideburn trimmer is placed below the razor head in the back and is useless without a second mirror. Luckily I have a different razor for those purposes.If the trimmer is important to you, this is not the product you want. If you are simply looking for a good shave, I'd say give this a try."
2,Even around the neck? Not as promised.,"I have owned this razor for about 18 months and it doesn't live up to it's promise. It works okay but for the price, I'd stick with my old Norelco with the half micro-screen style. I do like that you can rinse this one under water and the battery seems to hold up well. I actually think I can shave with a normal bic razor & shaving cream just as fast as I can with the arcitec, though and most of the time I need to run one of those over the spots on my neck that the arcitec misses. Overall, not worth the extra money."
1,This razor is a rip off,"First time I've ever wasted time writing a review, but I HATE this razor. The small hair collection chambers fill up and this thing spits hair all over the sink - gross. One of the blades broke (admittedly after a year of use) but I ended up slicing up my face. Thumbs down Norelco...BG"
2,I wanted this to be a good shaver....,"I've owned this shaver for about 5 days now and I get disappointed about my purchase day by day due to the following reasons: Misses hair a lot especiall in the neck area, causes rashes, and requires mini scissors or actual blade to get rid of missed neck hair.....I REALLY wanted this shave to be the one because it was the most expensive shaver I bought..I do not recommend this product to anyone and especially people with sensitive skin. I'm going to ask Philips for my money back.."
1,Don't waste your money......,"I am 59 years old, I have used norelco electric razors for at least 35 years maybe longer. This arcitec is the most expensive and the most worthless piece of crap I have ever bought. It doesn't deserve to carry the norelco label. They must of forgot to try this one out before putting it on the store shelf . All I can say is SHAME ON NORELCO, I will never buy another norelco product, because I am might be taken to the cleaners again....."
1,hype is much better than products performance,"I bought this product based on the hype, the review, & the good name of the manufacturer.Unfortunately this product did not live up to expectations. First, it took twice as longto shave. Second, it left my face mutilated, irritated,& scratched. To get a close shaveI had to go over & over the same spots.I've used the shaver three times. I've gone back to my straight edge. I only wish therewas an electric that was efficient & effective."
1,Bad Shave,"3 months after purchasing the 1050X, I can not shave with these heads. I called Norelco and got a letter back stating that I had to request a refund with 45 days. The razor runs OK. The problem seemed to be the heads. I would have been pleased to get new heads. I have used Norelco shavers for at least 40 years and this is the first the heads have failed so quickly."
4,"Excellent shaver, trimmer needs work",I've recently moved from my trusty Gillette Fusion Power over to this electric and I have been pleasantly surprised. After trying the Braun Pulsonic and finding it a bit rough on my face the Arcitec worked much better (your face may react differently but my chubby mug didn't like the Pulsonic).I have a THICK scruff each morning and the Arcitec ate right through it. It took about a week for the shaver to break-in enough that it got everything on a first or second pass so that was a bit irritating but livable.The trimmer really needs work and practice and that's my only major complaint.
5,The 1050 is super! ! !,"I purchased mine about 5 weeks ago. It's great!Prior to buying, I read many many of the reviews and as a result was quite skeptical and leary about trying one. Since I new I could return it if not satisfied, I decided to give it a try. It's a fine piece of work. Clean, relatively quick saves; gets the long wiskers too; smooth face; no razor burn; long lasting (long!) between charges; the trimmer works very well; no fuss to clean, just open the three heads over the sink, they hold the shaved wiskers very satisfactorally until dumped (mini-minimal drops to the floor or my chest; no need to rinse but probably smarter to do in the long run; very pleased with it. Don't worry, try it for yourself. Push out, mon, and circle in the lift of life. Jaun Armostrongalis, Montpelier , Vt."
4,Happy Hubby,"Philips Norelco Arcitec 1050 men's shaver - My husband who is 78 was very pleased to receive this highly advertisied shaver. He is pleased with its performance, but does not believe it lives up to the advertising claims and the package was a real challenge to get into."
1,Didn't work for me,"The razor worked great on the beard on my face, but NOT AT ALL on the hair that grows under my chin! Like all other razors I have tried, it left an unpleasant rash and did not clip the hairs closely."
5,best little shaver I ever owned!,"Cannot understand why this type of razor wasn't invented many years ago.Seems like something that should've been available in the 90's.Great to finally shave with electric and no longer feel roughness under chin on the front of my throat!Feel I should be re-imbursed for the other Norelco's I bought throughout my life.Good job!Do I win anything?Truly,Jim Haugh"
1,Terrible Razor,"I've been using Norelco shavers my entire life with good results. But this new generation of aritec shavers are awful! I don't shave everyday and the blades on this razor are not cable of cutting longer whiskers. Anything longer than a five o clock shadow and this razor can't handle it. I addition this model is messy; there is no chamber for the the clippings fall into. Thus your shirt, the floor and counter will be covered with clippings. Also on the downside, the side-burn trimmer is completely inadequate; it too tiny to be functional. I returned this model and bought Norelco's cheapest model the 7110x and its infinitely better for only a fraction of the price!"
