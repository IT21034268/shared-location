3,Poor choice for title,"I liked the information related to chickens but the title should almost have been ""Gardening With Chickens, How to use chickens to build up your garden soil.""I didn't like the whole how to compost part of the book I bought it looking for ideas and plans on how to build chicken tractors for both layers and fryers. What I found didn't have the plans I was looking for while the book has much good information it does not stay on topic as far I am concerned.If the title had been different I would have given the book 4 or 5 stars."
2,Clever idea better executed elsewhere,"In this book, Andy Lee demonstrates that a market gardener can raise chickens. Sadly, his chicken tractor design (Chapter 3) is both too heavy and too fragile for use in even such a mild climate as western Oregon. It is also too tall to step into, but too short to walk into. No animal pen should be so difficult to work in.A better chicken tractor design can be found in Joel Salatin's _Pastured Poultry Profits_ or by searching the Web.A better book on raising chickens is Gail Damerow's _A Guide to Raising Chickens_, which I consider the best book for a novice to chickens."
2,"has good concepts, but the steps and details are off","I used this book for some research and experiment ideas in agriculture. while it has some great general ideas and concepts, i found that the entire instructions for building the chicken tractor were lacking in detail and had conflicting drawings and steps. some required materials were not listed, and the process was vague. in reading the book, it seemed to me like a great book idea, but was very hastily presented and lacked thorough attention to detail. it looked very ""thrown together"". it is a book i recommend checking out from a library if you want some ideas, but i wouldn't waste my money purchasing it in hopes of practical steps for a chicken tractor. (the book might give inspiration, but YOU will have to come up with the practical details of trying and experimenting to build your tractor.) hint...lightweight and portable materials and use creativity to adapt their basic (and vaguely presented) tractor"
2,Unprofessional,"I purchased the book because I was interested in raising chickens and building a chicken tractor. The technical aspects of building the chicken tractor are not clearly outlined, but after many re-readings I was able to construct one. The authors also mention nesting boxes and pop door on the chicken tractor but show no pictures or diagrams. Much of the information was repetitive in spots, and I thought that many of the cartoons were in bad taste."
3,The subtitle of this book is misleading; where are the hens?,"As would-be Permaculturalists, what a great idea to raise a few chickens for eggs, occasionally throw one in the pot, in the meantime fertilizing gardens and orchard. We bought ""Chicken Tractor"" on the promise that everything we would need to know was contained therein. We are very disappointed. The authors do a good job with the chickens' abilities to fertilize. However, their focus is on raising chickens for slaughter and sale. Although they refer to ""eggmobiles"", one is referred elsewhere for plans. We wish we had foregone this book, and started elsewhere."
4,Great Jersey and customer care,Great product although it runs a bit smaller than your normal size. After reading other reviews I took the hint and went with a medium (I wear size small) and it fits great. Had a slight mix up with the order and the Bike Somewhere crew took care of it immediately and fixed the problem.
4,the one that did it,"This is the PT album that did it for me. After hearing this , I had to get their entire output. What an album ! Sonic landscapes that take you through mood after mood.If you've never experienced PT , this would be a great place to start"
2,Pink Floyd Wannabes,"Roger Waters would scoff at this rip off. Some Pink Floydish tunes mixed with sound effects and sonic interludes. Pompous, arrogant...I'm sorry but this group is not the modern answer to the great prog hope. I'm sorry but I can't relate to this nor Spock's Beard's horse hockey. For the retro lover like Spaniel Pegrossa."
4,The record in wich PT starts to grow,"This record is full of atmospheres. Is for listening in a room with the lights out, and a glass of wine in your hand. Recommended"
3,the ideal snack,"20 years ago when I was a kid, handi snacks were *extremely* popular. All the kids had them, and for an affordable price, parents didn't mind giving in and buying them. Now however, things have changed. They are no longer popular. Not that it matters or anything, but what does certainly matter is that the size of the crackers have shrunk considerably. No it's not just because I'm an adult now that it appears they're smaller, they really *are* smaller. Also, I'm just going to pretend I'm not seeing a 40-dollar price tag for a box of 8. Hopefully that's incorrect and it's just a glitch or the seller made a mistake in actually charging that much. Totally not worth it."
3,fresh and crisp,The crackers were fresh and crisp and the cheeses dip tasty. These are perfect for just a bite to get through to mealtime and the individual serving packaging means they remain fresh longer. Good value!
3,Ritz?,"Recently I enjoyed some Ritz Crackers with friends and we discussed how they compare with Waverlys, Town House, Captain's Wafers, etc. The Ritz being the best of the style. Then I saw these! Ritz Crackers with Cheese-like product. It's about time. Then I tried them, only to find out that these aren't Ritz Crackers. They aren't round, its true, but they still aren't Ritz Crackers. These are the same crackers that Kraft has always used on these Handi-Snacks. I still gave it three stars because they're fine for Cheeze n Crackers, but the name is misleading."
1,"Good Food, but Cheese is not full...60%","I just bought a case of these at Costco. The Crackers & Cheese are good, but every single package of the Crackers and cheese, had a 1/3 of the cheese Missing, what a rip off... I w.It's like it was not filled completely to save cheese. If I pay for something I expect the product to be full, not1/3 AIR...I will never buy this product again...I can understand if it was just 1, but it was all of them."
4,"Great product, great price","From what I can tell from my research, this contains the same ingrediants as in Techron. I put in an ounce or two each time we fill it up somewhere that doesn't have Techron in their gas already (like Sam's & Costco). We aren't consistant enough to know if it makes a difference in gas mileage or not, but my hope is that doing this prevents us from having to do a fuel system cleaning."
3,I guess its good?,I have a 07 civic si when my gas tank was running low I dumped a bottle of this and filled up with gas. I ran the entire tank and I honestly felt no difference. The car runs exactly the same as it did before using this redline product. I didn't give it a low rating because it might work for people that have older high mileage cars but I also didn't give it a high rating because it did nothing to my car.
2,The car won't start after using it,I've put the whole bottle into the gas tank as the instruction said. The car drives OK at the beginning and the MPG does seem to improve. But later I notice that I have problem to start the car. At the beginning it won't start at the first time but will start after several tries. After 3 days the car dies completely. I can't no longer start it.The customer service said I've put more than recommended volume into the gas tank. I don't know if it is the problem. Be cautious if you want a try.
2,Didn't work,"Unfortunately, this product did not work for me as advertised. I purchased it after reading many reviews, but in those other reviews, the people were talking about something specific: certain chemicals that it was supposed to contain, chemicals that made it what it was. Without them, it was just like Chevron gas. As I take care of my car, this did absolutely nothing for me, unlike the Seafoam that I used on my engine, so I would recommend to anyone who is reading this to use Seafoam if you get the chance, and read some guides on it. It is not only fun, but also a great cleansing agent."
1,Too much problems,"If you want to go crazy, just try this redline. Your car will drive you really crazy. Loss in power, clogged fuel filter, bad fuel pump issues, and go on..."
1,Might as well put in sugar instead,I added this Red Line to my 2004 Tahoe. After about 35 gallons my engine light came on.The errors were for multiple misfires so I replaced the spark plugs and flushed the plugs. Two weeks later my 7 month old catalytic converter lite up my engine light again with the code for low efficiency.I called the company and was never able to speak with anyone about the issues. Avoid this product and company at all costs. Because it will cost you!
3,I got this stuff but didnt notice a huge difference...,"Being a big fan of Red Line products, I was hoping for a big night and day transformation of my 1997 Toyota Camry. Sadly, it just didn't happen. I didn't want to give it 5 stars as I just didn't notice anything, but, I didn't want to give it 1 star as I trust Red Line in their products. My guess for the lack of difference is probably in the fact that I only use name brand gasoline. I figure that the better quality fuels probably have enough detergents in them now a days as to not really require a heavy cleaning. Perhaps if I were more negligent in the upkeep of my car I would have seen a more noticeable bump in performance."
4,Appears to Work Great,"We purchased this fuel system cleaner for a 2005 Toyota 4Runner, and could immediately see a difference in the mileage and the operation of the vehicle. If you are looking for a fuel cleaner this appears to be the one to use."
5,great stuff,"The fuel economy on my IS250 went from a 23mpg average down to 18.5. Tried replacing filters, didn't help. Added this and the mileage went right back to normal. What else can I say? If you have a dirty intake, it does the job. I used to bottle in a full tank. Ordering another to use on a regular basis (one bottle per 100 gallons)."
3,Can't really tell if it worked,"I bought 3 and used them on our 2002 Honda S2000, 2005 Acura TL, and 2010 Honda Odyssey. I track the gas mileage on the vehicles for the past 2 years with an app. I can't really tell if it the fuel cleaner actually does anything. Maybe it's because all our vehicles have relative low miles with the most on the TL at 70,000 and the least on van since it's the newest."
5,Easy to find information,"Dr. Mcdowall's book is an excellent addition to our families health. With the knowledge that I have obtained form clinical pearls for better health, my family is on the way to a more enjoyable life. From cures for nightmares to walking on tippee toes, this book has the lot. Also an excellent reference guide to herbal remedies, ideal for sales assistants in health food stores! I would certainly recommend this book to any one who wants inexspensive and effective ways to improve their health!!"
1,Old Crusty Chocolates!,"Someone was kind enough to buy me these chocolates from my giftlist. I've had Godiva chocolates delivered from Godiva's own site but thought it would be easier to list them on Amazon. BIG MISTAKE! When ordered from Godiva the chocolates were shipped fresh and cold with an ice pack to make sure they didn't melt. The chocolates from Amazon where shipped in a regular box, most of the chocolates where melted into a solid block. They were also dry and crusty. I would think that Godiva would have to same standards no matter how people order their products. I'm a very unsatisfied customer."
1,disappointing and overpriced,"Bought a 12-piece box of Godiva truffles at a brick-and-mortar bookstore. Priced at $25, but had a $10 off coupon. At this price these should be melt in your mouth delicious morsels of chocolatey goodness. Nope. Inside the chocolate shell is not a lovely, rich ganache, but a variety of ... I don't know what. Some are a caramel sort of stuff, some are this overly sweet, not so tasty white stuff. These are on par with what you might get cheap at a drug store. Actually, I even prefer Lindt truffles, which you can get three for the price of one of these."
1,Stale,"These arrived very promptly, but they seem to have languished on the shelf for months, given how stale they were. I can't recommend that these be purchased from any reseller, but Water Skin's supply seems way past the shelf life of the product."
5,Delicious,"Nice packaging, great taste, and fair price. I would consider this again sometime for a gift. Its a shame they don't offer gift wrapping for this."
5,Electronica's b*stard child,"Everyone and there brother has made a fast paced electronica dance album, but AIR are the first band to make a great slow-paced electronica album (that's not ambient). If you're used to fast stuff, like me, you'll dig the change of pace this offers (Although I must admit that I still would love to hear some fast remixes of these songs)."
4,C'est Le Bon,"A great CD made for chillin' with your girlfriend at bedtime. Good combination of funk, slow jazz, and looping that puts it in it's own niche. It's original--if not lazy, fun."
3,Pretty Good,"It creates a pretty interesting, urbane, laid back mood. And as one reviewer pointed out, some of it DOES have resonances of ELO, which I think is great (in small doses). If you like Stereolab's recent stuff, you may find this interesting -- its sort of on a par with that. And its far more successful, although less energetic, than Pizzicato 5, who also deal in similarly kitschy material."
5,My favorite cd!,I love this cd. You can play it over and over again and never tire of it. It's puts me in a near trance. I wish they had previous recordings.
3,"Starts out great, goes downhill","I bought this CD because I went NUTS about ""sexy boy""...was radically different than stuff I'd been listening to. I thought this album was gonna be a ""grower"" on me, but I've since discovered that the first four tracks are great, but the rest just fade into the background."
4,An excellent introduction to chillout,"When I bought this CD three years ago, I was astounded by the slowness and smoothness of the tracks - I hadn't heard anything like it before. These days, after becoming familiar with the likes of Zero 7 and Massive Attack (trip-hop), the vocals on Moon Safari detract from my enjoyment of the CD overall.Still, ""La Femme D'Argent"" and ""Le Voyage De Penelope"" are among my favorite tracks of any genre, and ""You Make It Easy"" is a great romantic song. On the whole, I'm very glad I own this CD and although it's not for everyone, I recommend it to those of you looking to discover new genres or expand your collection of chillout music."
3,"Calm down, People","...This record is very strong, and the second track, despite the abrasive name, is spectacular. The rest? Superbly-arranged blips and bloops, but several things keep this one from really standing out. The Beth Hirsch songs are weak, and, for those who are interested, the entire album doesn't reveal one really solid lyrical piece. These guys go way, way, way overboard with the vocoder. Wouldn't mind some more moog, though."
2,Ehhh ...? Really?,"I very much enjoy Zero 7 music and bought this CD hoping to experience the same bliss.Unfortunately I stand much disappointed. Most of the tracks sound short of inspiration and kind of cheesy to my ear.This style of music skates on thin ice, often close to lapsing in the dreaded ""background/elevator music"" category.That's my honest - if perhaps too harsh, assessment of Moon Safari. Not sure if other CDs from Air would fare better?Oh well, the music quest cannot be always satisfying."
2,Cheap vinly,"The vinyl adds 0 quality to this music. In fact, this purchase after 1 play is going back. The music is mediocre at best. Nothing inventive and alot to be desired."
2,extremely 80's,"late 70's Early 80's, If you like that stuff... I purchased this under the recommendation that it sounded like Massive Attack.... It Is Nothing like Massive Attack! Total 80's."
2,Boring,I don't understand how this album has a better rating than Talkie Walkie. The songs on this album bored me death. Everyone seems to prefer this album over Air's other albums but I think Talkie Walkie is much better. I liked nearly every song on Talkie Walkie and I only liked a few moments on Moon Safari. Overrated.
3,Air- Moon safari,"Great CD, although I was a little disappointed to find that Disk 1 had some scratches on it!!"
4,Not Air's Best - But Already Very Good,"Air's first album 'Moon Safari' is the least brilliant of the band's albums so far.Still, it is a very worthwile buy.Sometimes it sounds like music which can be used for tv series, like 'Talisman'. Or 'Ce Matin Là' with its horn sounds and bubbling synths.The spacey 'Sexy Boy' is very early-1980ish and must be a dance floor hit. Funny and great track, a lot more optimistic and relaxed than most Air stuff. 'Kelly Watch The Stars' is another great song - the favourite song of many an Air fan. The way it uses the synthesizer effects is simple but well-arranged in the smallest detail.At the lower end of the scale are the two songs on which Beth Hirsch sings the lead vocals. ..."
2,It was Okay...,"This CD was a little less than I was expecting from it. Only liked about 3 tracks on it, and only one of those blew my socks off. I probably would not buy it again if I could go back."
4,Very good CD,This is a very good CD of electronica.Great mix of vocal and instrumentaltunes.Generally uptempo and enjoyable.Recommended.
5,AIR's dreamy sound is a gas.,"Moon Safari. Just saying it brings a smile to my face. Just like the title, so unexpected and dreamy, so is the album. Created using a harmonic blend of keyboards, synthisizers, and melodic vocals, Moon Safari captures a unique sound that deserves attention. Among many fav songs is ""A New Star In The Sky"" which borrows from vintage 70's love anthems, then bends it, into a wonderful cloud-like feeling. In the world of electronica, its good to know that these guys are around to give us all a good breath of fresh AIR. (Ha HA)"
4,Lush,"If you constantly feel like putting a whole through the wall from all the rage and strain of everyday existence, you must have 'Moon Safari'. Put this disc on and you will feel like you're floating on air. Air's luscious and sophisticated tunes don't test your attention span and they're very easy on the ears. It often sounds like lounge music for the future, and it's no surprise these guys are French. Highlights include 'La Femme D'Argent','All I Need' and 'Sexy Boy,' while 'Ce Matin La' is a dreamily languid tune that hits you like a cool gust of fresh air. Needless to say, if you want pounding bass lines or thrashing guitars this album is definitely not for you."
2,More Dance songs please,"This is probably the french duo's best album to date, however i don't really know where they stand cause the variation of the songs is huge. Some are catchy dance-pop"" Kelli watch the stars"" some others almsot sound like Jazz ""Talisman"" who would have thought Air made them both?. ""You make it easy"" is almost a ballad, quite boring if yoy go all the way to the store to get a dance album, and when you get back 50% of the songs are something else.""Ce Matin La"" is a nice one, slow and romantic with someone playing the trumpet, no dance once again. ""All i need"" is allright, but more like pop, with a female singer making the lyrics. i like ""Remember"" ""Kelly Watch the stars"" and ""Sexy Boy"" which are all pure dance, could they make some more of that kind i would judge this cd alot better."
2,Great album? Not even close....,"First off, I bought this after purchasing many chillout discs. In total, I own over 500 CD's. I listen to a lot of music and I am very selective.This album is not five stars or even close in my opinion. First, I hardly call most of these cuts 'songs.' They play more like experimental music tracks where vocals are an after thought. The guys shouldn't be singing. Period. The so called hit Sexy Boy is annoying, Remember is ridiculously sentimental nothingness and Talisman sounds like a piano riff in which they just kept piling on the sound effects. I gave this a chance, listend to it five times over a month and I grew less and less interested and more and more annoyed. Granted, Talkie Walkie is better.(...)"
1,Watered Down Trash,"This record is the biggest disappointment I have ever suffered. After reading the positive reviews on Amazon.com and having a couple friends recommend it I went out and bought it. I thought track #1 which was not all that impressive at least showed some promise because it had a decent beat and bass line. Unfortunately, this mediocre track turned out to be the best on the album as it was all down hill from there. From what I remember from that 1st (and last) listening, the remainder of the album was filled with bubble gum music that reminded me more of the Partridge Family than of the other groups which some people mistakenly identify Air with like Massive Attack and FatBoy Slim (my apologies to those groups for referencing them in an Air review). This CD will never come out of its box again unless someone offers me 25 cents or more to take it off my hands."
3,Didn't take me to the moon,"this album just really didn't do it for me. i looove loooove loooove looooooooove Zero 7 and there are many comparisons of Air to Zero 7 and vice versa. but Zero 7 just has a better execution of their music and just kinda has this magic that Air doesn't possess.Trip Hop music is one the my favorite genres and i'm constantly trying to find bands like Zero 7, but there really aren't any.This album has dashes of Zero 7 and they have good instrument accompanyment and its experimental. but it didn't do it for me mostly because of the techno feeling of the album. my most hated genre of music if techno right beside country. and it just annoys me.if you like techno slowed down with instrument accompanyment, then buy this album. if you are expecting a brother Zero 7, just listen to another one of their cd's again (all of them kicka**!!)"
1,Wish I Could Give No Stars,"Just think of the words one would use to describe bad music in general -- repititive, undeveloped, lyrically weak, forgettable, etc . -- and what does one have? answer: Air. Do not -- I repeat DO NOT -- be fooled by any of the positive reviews given this record. You will be highly disappointed and in such a bad mood you might end kicking your dog or something. And, animals should not be abused because a couple of guys from France make a real trashy record."
4,Like walking on the moon,I enjoyed this album for many reasons because it offers resonating mellow sounds combined with an upbeat tempo. Great to listen to in the car while driving or just at home to relax.
4,Moving on out,"Moon Safari is many things, but I must be the one person who does not see it as moving. Mellow certainly, uplifting maybe, but moving? I don't think so. There's no sense of depression to warrant such a label - just an album chock full of inch-perfect melodies which are more companion than confrontation. There's no need to listen, the music's just there if you need it - and once you own the album, you'll feel as though you DO need it. I love the album, I respect other people's opinions. I just don't always agree!"
4,"Sexy, stylish and oh so cool","This has got to be some of the sexiest music ever. It is comforting and beautiful, and overall just simply super-cool. I only hope that Air continues to make music forever, their music evokes emotions which are eternal. Get this and then get the wonderful ""Premiers Symptomes""."
3,Beth Hirsch is sensational,"This CD is worth getting for ""All I Need"" and ""Kelly Watch the Stars"" alone. ""All I Need"", like many other tracks on the album, features the sensual vocals of Beth Hirsch. I would probably buy one of her CDs before another Air CD! Her voice really makes some of the tracks, although on tracks like ""Kelly Watch the Stars"" Air are more than able to inject their own vibrancy into the music without Hirsch. Some tracks on the album, like ""Remember"", are lacklustre and monotonous, and for that it gets a three as opposed to a four from me. Still a good buy though! It's great to hear quality electronic contemporary music that rises above the dull depths of the likes of Scooter et al!"
4,This is good stuff...,"""Moon Safari"" is a terrific album, and I would highly reccommend it to anyone who's into electronica. Although I prefer the sad beauty of ""The Virgin Suicides,"" this is equally good."
3,"Worst album Air has made, to my knowledge.","After listening to 'Talkie Walkie' for years, really liking '10000hz The Legend' and 'pocket symphony', I wanted to listen to their first. It was rated with 4.5 stars on allmusic.com (highest of any of the albums) so I downloaded it through amazon thinking it would be very good.I don't really like it, it is cheeky and juvenile compared with their later stuff. Very predictable and just not sophisticated like the other albums. :/"
5,Excellent!,"This CD is probably the best I've ever spent my money on. The one thing I'd say though, is it's not really dance or techno or house or anything, it's softer than that, but it's the most beautiful, wonderful, awesome CD I've ever owned by far! You really should buy it, I can guarantee you won't regret it. If you want to ask me anything about, feel free to email me!"
3,"On Second Thought, Actually Pretty Good","When I first listened to this record I thought it was the pits (read my review from March). After giving it a second chance, I must say it's pretty good. Most songs are very listenable. It's much better than the typical ""Trip-Hop"" stuff that seems to be dominating the scene today. I think most people that like electronica or trip-hop will find this a most appealing record."
5,Album of the year,As i see it - this amazing sound of them with the easy listening motives and a little bit of ambiant is one of the most refreshing sounds of this year. That and the technological Quality of the writers.
5,A must have in everyone's record collection.,"It's just one of those records that still grooves even after you've heard it 100 times. Not to be mistaken for a CD with a hit single and 11 album tracks, this one's good all around. Great and consistent vibe throughout. One of the ten I'd like to have if I was stranded on a desert island."
5,Excellent Album...,"This album is great. Moon Safari manages to appeal to many different emotional states of being for me, while maintaining a cool, fresh, ubiquitous aura of calmness. Air melds several different musical ""styles"" extremely well together, such that, it's difficult to truly finger what really is the preeminent musical style on this album.Every track has something unique and great to offer. Most all listeners with an open mind will find this album laudable.Highlights: ""Kelly Watch the Stars,"" ""Sexy Boy,"" ""Voyage de Penelope"""
4,"Great cd, near perfection","This is one fantastic cd. A real genuine effort, although it doesn't reach perfection, it is well worth purchasing. A couple tracks drag on a bit too long, but otherwise it is all good. Standouts include Sexy Boy and Kelly watch the stars."
5,Emotional Excellence,"I listen to a lot of jazz and a little techno, and this CD really built the bridge between the two for me. For me, Air is the Stan Getz of electronic music... it makes you emotional and sets a mood with seemingly little effort. ""Moon Safari"" makes me feel a little bit of everything, love (""You Make It Easy""), longing (""All I Need""), sadness (""Ce Matin La""), dispair (""Talisman""), and even glimpses of that feeling that makes you want to shake your booty (to ""Sexy Boy""). My hands-down favorite songs are ""You Make It Easy"" and ""Ce Matin La"", but all the songs are good. This CD proves to be one that, like Moby's ""Play"", can stay in your CD player for months."
4,Wonderful and light.,"Very good album, one of very few that automatically inspire an emotional response of joy much like the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds or Stevie Wonder. For some reason it reminds me of the morning after I lost my virginity."
4,A must have of electronic,these franch guys came out in the 98 to put the basis for the modern lounge and elecro-dance.A must have in every personal discoteque for genre lovers.
5,A life-changing experience,"I bought this CD on a whim after hearing 'Kelly Watch the Stars'. After flicking through some some random CDs in a shop I came across 'Moon Safari' and the cover seemed to jump out at me - even the graphics seemed to sum up my mood. When I went home and listened to it I could not believe my luck at making such an extroadinary find. The meloncholy first track simply stopped me in my tracks and it didn't stop there, every note on the album gives you a kind of fazed out, laid back coolness that is a good philosophy for life. Slow down, chill out and listen to Air, you'll never look back. A superb album."
5,HIGHLY RECOMMEND,"Nothing new but those one hit wonderbands on your alternative stations? Rap annoy you? Classic rock is just..old? Techno getting to ya? Heres a band that combines a little jazz, a little techno, and a lot of slow, dreamy, relaxing tunes that are just amazing. Ive passed this cd on to many friends and family, and theyve all loved it. Highly recommend..Tracks 1,3,4 are amazing..the rest is ""merely"" fantastic. GO BUY IT NOW"
4,Claudia Learned to Walk!,"My 14 month old child took some of her first steps to track 1,Le Femme d'Argent! She now walks free and gracefully! That track is just phenominal from opening organ to end. I need to play it again to her and see her reaction.I first heard about Air from Tribune concert review at Chicago Metro. Wish I was at Show. I ordered Moon Safari. As old (42) eletronic music fan ( Kraftwerk, Soft Cell, 80s Depeche, Yaz, Silver Apples, Pre Dark Side of Moon PF, ORB etc.) and electronic engineer, I admire electronic music tinkers that can play real music. Moon Safari certainly brings the genre forward with a classical / pop influence."
3,Prozac pop,"Cool/lame French easy-listening kitsch-pop. Pleasant, soothing, and an generally enjoyable disc; perfect pop music for a generation zonked out on Prozac. More adventurous and sophisticated listeners may wish to go the Spiritualized/Orb route instead."
2,track number one it's great...,"Track number one it's pretty good.It makes me feel good,light...But that's all I could get from this CD.I am still not sure if just one track deserves 12 bucks..."
2,give me a break,"To those who gave 5 stars to this CD I would say: buy yourself a pair of new ears. There is not a new armonic progression or melody. It's all in some previous work: Sylvie Vartan, Serge Gainsbourg, Ennio Morricone, progressive music, the electronic scene of the late seventies, the string-based arrangements... the album would have gone unnoticed at the time of ""Video Killed the Video Stars"" or ""Visage"". The charm of these songs is that they are inoffensive: they are restatements of music you have heard forever. I give the musicians the benefit of the doubt: they really wanted to make music for hairdressers. The only song with some quality is ""All I need""."
5,Sit back and relax,"This is one of the best and finest examples of chill-out/ambient/downtempo music I've found so far. Cleverly striking a balance between too quirky and too conventional, ""Moon Safari"" is just a smooth album. Not everything works (""Sexy Boy"" is out of place, and the vocal tracks are mediocre), but when the album is on (""Ce Matin La"", ""Kelly Watch The Stars"", ""New Star In The Sky""), it's fantastic. A final note, though: don't expect to instantly love this album. It takes some getting used to, but is well worth it. Great for tossing on before you go to bed or just to calm you down after a long day."
3,"Pleasant electro-muzak, mostly","I definitely don't understand. There are many, MANY wizened, sophisticated techno music fans who love to sneer in superior fashion when confronted with dance music that in any way, shape, or form can be judged ""cheezy."" Yet a lot of these same self-styled cutting-edge sophisticates just melt at the very mention of the French duo, Air. This cd is ""nice"" and ""mellow,"" but definitely reeks of pop/schlock/sentimentalism. ""Kelly Watch the Stars?"" Are you kidding? Where's the great appeal? This stuff is cotton candy for the ears and mind, but little more. Go to the chillout room and enjoy, folks."
4,Sway,"This is the pinnacle of sit back and relax albums. It doesn't put you in a trance, it just makes you feel serene, but also lazy, my motivation seems to disappear when I listen to this. Air are extremely gifted at crafting a beautiful melody. I personally am tired with all the emphasis on rhythm in electronic music. This album is filled to the brim with them, the first and best song on the album starts with a cliche water sound, then all these melodies just come and go, little hand claps show themselves, and its 7 minutes long and it could be double that and it wouldn't be boring. So, as most know, the stoners have united and proclaimed their chill-out music to be this album, you can join them if you wish."
4,Just buy it...,If you are a fan of this band or just like instrumental/electronic music-you should purchase this CD.
2,"Damn, I'm Disappointed.","I bought this CD without knowing what it was about. I knew the songs ""Kelly, Watch the Stars"" and ""Sexy Boy"", and as I liked them so much, I decided to buy the album. Thruth is the first time of listening to it, I hated it. I thought all the songs would be as creatively bizzare as the 2 songs I already knew. I have listened to it more, and another track that I liked well was ""Remember Me"", and maybe ""New Star In the Sky"", but I gotta say the rest of the songs definitively don't stand out. I hated tracks like ""All I Need"", which reminded me of Zero 7. I didn't like the voice of the girl singing, it bored me to death to listen to her... I feel like I've wasted my money. I don't think it's an album that grows on you... it sounds nothing very special, and I didn't like most of the elements since they're to simple, but in a bad way. I prefered Talkie Walkie better, a more complex album, with more evolutioned technologies and ideas, and peculiar songs."
2,dull,"dull. Do you want ambient, want to listen without the desire to turn on the TV or do something else? Then don't buy this. Get Morcheeba or Zero 7."
1,doesn't do it for me,"coming from a rock viewpoint, this music is garbage. I see all the other bad reviews and they're getting very low percentage for how helpful they are, and I can't help but think that all those votes are from Air-affiliated entities. As one other reviewer stated, all the songs are repetitive and boring. Some of the songs use the same exact notes throughout the entire song. In my opinion, a lot of today's pop has much more musical talent than this album."
1,pretty sure they sent me wrong size,I was pretty sure I'm a size 10 so I ordered a 10. I knew that based on another ring I have and also from measuring my finger using a chart.Well what I have here is about a size 13. It's huge. Way too big. Way off =(The ring is really pretty and really my style. Which only makes me more sad.There is a fee for exchanges. Boo. Maybe buying rings online just isn't a good idea.
3,Mystery miscellany,"Crumley's an original who doesn't write enough. Like the characters of his books, he's a hard drinker, and it unfortunately affects the output. But would he be the same writer if he wasn't the same drinker? We'll never know, so we'll just have to enjoy what precious little escapes. In The Muddy Fork there's a little bit of everything, most of it illuminating on Crumley, as well as on the slightly seamy side of the West. This is the modern Western, warts and all, as unlike John Wayne as cyberpunk is unlike Asimov. My favorite stuff here is the non-fiction, but the short fiction and the brief interview is worthwhile. The novel excerpts (from uncompleted novels) I could have missed, at least while Crumley is still alive and the possibility remains that he may finish one of these."
4,Extra Step,This is a very simple solution to reaching things in the bed and stepping over the tailgate when necessary. Looks good too
5,Very nice and looks cool too!,This product is really cool. It looks good and is functional as well. I have it on my 2011 Pathfinder and I like the fact that it stands out. I hope that it will keep folks from parking too close in parking lots. The step is great too. I really like it and would recommend it for anyone who needs an extra step or just plain likes the looks of it.
3,Bully Bar for rear bumper,"I loved the addition to my 2008 Envoy. It matches my front Bully Bar and my side Raptor steps. Only negative is, I have to go to the parts house and find and adapter to plug the brake light into the bumper plug."
4,Rear Park Assist,"I like the product, but it disables the rear park assist on my 2009 Chevy Silverado."
3,Bully CR-600 Plastic Step Pad,"Item is sharp looking and very functional. My only complaint is the plastic logo'ed Bully plastic step surface. The plastic is faded to whitish color from suns UV rays. The step should have been rubber. Now, I need to spray paint the plastic step surface to restore original color. This happened in 4 short months in the Florida sun."
2,Howell 09 er,This step is just fair. Quality is poor. Does not set square in hitch. I would look for a different manufacturer.
2,Plastic part fades quickly!,"Great hitch and design for the purpose of standing on it and having someone bump into the bumper but not happy with the black part of it fading so quickly. I've only had it for less than 6 months and the plastic is pretty much all grey color now. So, if you care about the fading part, then it's not recommended but if your use if for protection and a lot of standing on it, then it's worth it."
5,would recommend to everyone.,This book is better than I ever expected. It is packed full of beautiful pictures and Malawi cichlids knowledge. This is a must have for every cichlids enthusiast. I highly recommend this 400+ page book.
5,danielles review,the album is so cool love every song love the logical song its wicked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,I enjoyed it very much,"I enjoy reading anything having to do with Brooklyn, especially the ""good old days"". I spent 57 years living in Brooklyn"
3,"This book is'nt great, but surely it's adequate","This is the required text for a math class I am currently taking. While the book is not spectacular, it is written at an elementary level and it is not mired in proofs, so one can learn the material simply by opening the book and reading. A definite strength of this book is that it covers a wide range of problems, from ordinary DE's to some PDE's. But it also includes whole chapters on applications to mechanical and electrical systems(circuits), as well as numerical methods and Laplace Transformations. The book is clearly written as an introductory text, but it covers a broad range of material applicable to higher level courses."
3,Not a good book,"My main issue with the book is the lack of solved sample problems throughout the sections that I have read. I found this book to be a terrible source of information, but excellent source of examples to work through!"
2,hmmm,"It appears I'm the only person not from ithaca to review this book. I assume they're using this text at Cornell, or ithaca college, but I used this text at Texas A&M. Perhaps it was the instructor, but i didn't think that this book was that bad. Some of the proofs and explainations and examples were pretty lousy, but the assignment problems were pretty diverse, and i thought most of the explainations and examples were adequate. What i'm trying to say is that this text isn't that bad...."
1,This book is horrible,This book is easily the worst math book I have ever used in my life. The explanations and proofs are terribly written and very confusing. It is almost impossible to learn the material straight from the book. It's unfortunate that this book was required for my class.
1,The worst math textbook ever written,"This book is extremely difficult to understand. If your course requires this text, you'll probably want to get another diffeq textbook as an additional reference, because this book doesn't explain ANYTHING well."
5,Magical mystical music,"How have I lived this long without knowing these amazing songs? I first heard Tavi Gevenson's version of ""Beware of Young Girls"" through her blog and that led me to this amazing CD. Yes, 45-year old women have much to learn from savvy young 16-year olds..."
5,"Excellent, user-friendly guide with appeal to all levels.","I found this book very helpful and user-friendly. The information is accessible and I was able to find help easily in logical places. As I become a more experienced user, I find the book equally helpful for using more advanced techniques. It's one of the few technical books that I actually enjoyed reading."
5,Andy LaPlegua is the new king,"This album is amazing. If you are an industrial music fan, buy this right now. The sound is like a combination of the ohGr albums mixed with KMFDM and alittle Manson. Without a doubt the best album I've heard so far this year. Can't wait for the new Combichrist."
5,Solid resource information,I had an older edition that I used for several years. I upgraded to the revised 5th edition and have already used it. The information is organized in a way that makes researching questions easy. Some of my friends and family ask me to look up cancer information for them and the types of cancer section is the best I have seen.
2,Squakin Rubber Chicken,"I bought this item for my 9 year old grandson. Unfortunately, it didn't last very long as he broke the head off."
1,NOT RECEIVED,"I cannot possibly rate this. The product was ordered about a month ago, received a shipment notification about two weeks ago and my credit card has been charged. I still have not received them."
3,Rubber Chicken,I bought this as a gag gift...which works fine but do not think it would be that great of a toy.
4,Squakin chicken',"Needed a rubber chicken and thought what the heck, let's get one that squacks. Woke up an entire Boy Scout Troop the first morning with it. It is probably not as soft as I would have liked, but the squaking makes up for that. It has been a great prop."
1,Not rubber- cheap plastic,It's a hollow stiff plastic mould in the shape of a comic chicken that makes a horrible noise when squeezed. What a dissapointment and waste of money.
3,NOT BIG ENOUGH,"Believe me, the bigger the rubber chicken the louder and longer the scream. This is not a big chicken and its scream is pathetic! Also the dimensions make no sense - is it a 17"" rubber chicken or isn't it??"
2,That sound is not a chicken squawk!!!!,"Okay, it's a rubber chicken. I don't expect once. But that sound that the chicken makes it is NOT what chickens sound like at all! It is sort of close to what a slaughtered chicken sounds like. Sounds more like a cow in pain to me. Awful, awful sound! And it is horrendously LOUD!"
4,Fun & silly,I bought this toy because it has a very silly looking face and an annoying squawkin noise. My friends like to play around with it by throwing it around the room. It just cracks people up when they hear it squawk but others may find it annoying. My cats dislike the noise. My baby loves the noise and the toy itself. It is also pretty durable. Love it.
1,very upset,The product I received is not the same as the product picture that is on the product page.... not talking about the difference in texture or anythin... it is a completely different product that they sent me... I wanted the rubber chicken that is picutred in the product page -__-;..... The product does not squak or make any sort of noise at all. I want to return it
1,Disappointed!,"I was so hopeful after reading the reviews about the ""Squawkin Rubber Chicken"". But the reality is very disappointing. It doesn't ""squawk"" so much as ""squeak"". The sound is nothing more than a puppy's squeaky toy - and the squeaker doesn't even work half the time. Returning this and going back to the classic pinnacle of humor!!"
3,Be aware of shipping,Product does what it is supposed to. Be sure to look at shipping charges first. I was stupid and did not. Payed almost half of the price of the bottle on shipping. It does not cost near this much if you just do priority with the us postal service. Completely my own fault for not checking.
4,Handbook of the International Phonetic Association: A Guide to the Use of the International Phonetic Alphabet (International Han,Excellent handbook and very informative! Really useful if you are studying phonetics and language. It is also handy to have around when you have an 'always right' person who correct the manner in which you pronounce words!!!!
4,"His best ""Vocal"" album, but not his best guitar work","This album includes some of Dick's best vocal tracks, which are a nice change from time to time. As the other review said, this is Dick (Or his producer) trying to cash in on the surf & car craze of pop music during that era. It's ironic that Dick invented authentic surf music, then became a trend follower with the generic stuff.I have nothing against this album, I think it's great, it's just not his best guitar work. Obviously the Wedge is one of his best instro songs and that is represented here. A collector needs this album, a new fan needs to go to Surfer' Choice or his Greatest Hits album first, then revisit this album later."
1,"Democracy First, Capitalism Second","This book is the recipe for a corporate oligarchy. Democracy in and of itself is virutous. The will of the people is ALWAYS more important than the will of some unelected body (aka the supreme court, or, even worse, a corporate board like the WTO). Fareed Zakaria is my enemy because he is an enemy of democracy, the only true government."
3,About the author: To be assessed before reading,"Fareed Zakaria is one of the ""runaways"", who has been able to show his ""mettle"" which was facilitated after having fled to the magical environs of America, and not where they really belong. The actual test for the calibre of all such Asian intellectuals is the adage: ""This is Rhodes, leap here"". I don't think much of those who, once they have got there, start spinning such ""expert"" yarns. The one thing about (genuine) Western/European critics is that they neglect this angle when reviewing such matter. And there is a lot hidden there, as yet another adage, this time from Mr.Zakaria's native language, highlights: ""There is darkness beneath the base of the Lamp itself, that bearer of light..."""
1,Horrible...,"This book sucks. It's like a horse tranquilizer it's so boring. If you're thinking about reading this book, don't. I was so bored I didn't even notice what I was reading about. I give this book 12 thumbs down."
4,CORE VALUES,"The Future of Freedom always works at the core issues. NO political correctness here. It treats topics from our Constitution to terror, to the economic issues of Africa. This is a book about global economic politics. If you believe thal all politics is local, and it is about getting trash picked up and the street cleaned, you will not enjoy this book. However, if you are interested, you can learn why a Marshall Plan for the Islamic world is a bad idea.Cheers,"
5,a welcome break from the political screaming on TV...,"read this book on a long trip. very thought provoking, incisive, and very different from the shrill shallow stridency of polarized political pundits pontificating profanities against the other guys, be they liberals, neo-cons, right-wingers, whatever. wish more people get a chance to read material of this caliber, it makes you think and question without marching with the mob."
3,Compelling but . . .,"Well, I guess you can't please everyone and no system is perfect; but even ""imperfect"" democracy is still better than no democracy."
3,Much ado about nothing,"This book is commentary on observations such as:1) Democracy is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for a market economy, as evidenced by South Korea and Singapore2) Some conservatives would rather have a tyrant that taxes 10% of your income (the traditional formula historically) rather than a nanny state democracy that confiscates 40-60% of your income3) Absent a world government, you will have differences in government that create tension (not unlike having multiple currencies).A better book along the same themes is by Angell, ""The New Barbarian Manifesto"". Better written too."
2,"the book is new, but has a library seal on it","It took more than three weeks for the delivery; that is fine. I was not in a hurry. My concern is that the book has a library seal on it, which makes me very uncomfortable. I feel like the book has been stolen or there was some sort of wrong doing. I may be wrong, but the seal is a permanent mark and didn't understand a new book with a seal is on the market. Hope the seller will explain on this review.Other than this particular problem, it's a great price for clean new paperback book."
4,"My view of Fareed's ""Frredom...""","A very thorough instructive book, but it was less than I expected. I recommend it for anyone, it just didn'turn me on to want to read more, i.e. it was not a ""can't put it down"""
4,A Good Read,"Fareed Zakaria's book is an excellent read for anyone interested in world affairs. He successfully entertains while teaching the reader about where in the world democracy is thriving, and offers his own explanations as to why it has been less than successful in certain regions. Bringing together the economic factors often neglected in discussions of democracy and freedom, Zakaria shows that without establishing a framework where people can make an honest living first, a democratic society is likely to wind up democratically giving up freedom."
4,A Must have !!,"This is a must have for all those that love the glamorous ladies of the 40's and 50's eras.The photos are of very good quality and are stunning !!This book is full of amazing photos of actress's and actors of old hollywood. I used some to frame them and use in my vintage bedroom decor.They look beautiful on the walls.I am ordering another copy since I used some for framing.I will also be ordering the other Hollywood Glamor Portraits by John Kobal.You will not be disappointed with this book except for the fact that it is a paperback and not hard cover,which is why I rated it 4 stars.But all in all I'm still very happy with my purchase."
1,Nuke Nukote. I've learned my lesson.,"Horrible copies from the get-go from this ""remanufactured"" replacement toner cartridge for the HP Laserjet 1320 mono printer. Every printout had a black streak down the right edge of the page, usually from top to bottom. I've just swapped in a new HP brand cartridge and the printouts are fine. I've tossed the Nukote in the trash. It's not even worth the time and effort to send it back to the vendor. Also, the Nukote's orange plastic pull-tab broke off of the plastic strip while I was pulling to remove it prior to installing the cartridge in the printer. I managed to finish extracting it from the cartridge by pulling on the bare end of the plastic strip, but with difficulty. I'm leery of buying another third-party or re-manufactured toner cartridge, and certainly never a Nukote. I'm not promoting HP cartridges, it's just that I've never had a problem them."
3,cute movie,i watched this movie last night. i thought it was very cute would watch again another time. the lead man is very cute!!
2,Contemplate Your Navel Much?,"I'm stunned that there are so many favorable reviews of Anagrams. I love wordplay and wit, and despite a few moderately amusing turns of phrase, this book doesn't cut it for me. Worse, corny ""urban legends"" are supposed to pass for cleverness, as with ""Strings Too Short to Use."" What is she going to write about next, the socks that get lost in the dryer? Ultimately, these characters are unattractive people who traipse along in a chronic low mood, holding out the no doubt false promise that if only there were SSRIs in the water supply, they might actually become active participants in life. Don't hold your breath!"
4,A lonely life lasts only as long as your lack of imagination,"'Anagrams' serves to bemuse, amuse and ultimately touch the heart of single status daydreamer. Its brilliant observations of life, no longer as a spring chicken, are only bettered by its moving discussions on love desired, lost and ignored. Bella's comical imagination allows her to overcome loneliness by creating friends and daughters in a manner that is not disturbing. They provide solice when all around her things are going from bad to worse, socially, romantically and financially. In a subtle and heartfelt story, Moore urges us not accept that which fate deals us, and also take a moment to look around and see the positive, not merely the negative. She creatively weaves reality with illusion in order to produce a wonderful blend of tender intuition. A life of boredom can be avoided if you take a route straight through what is called 'Anagrams' by Lorrie Moore."
5,can't get better than this,I'm glad i'm in the right company and all the reviews are a testament to how tight and clever this work really is. Hard to put out of the disc tray.
5,"Original Beats, Good Samples, & Great SF House Music","Good album... hope you find it. Hawke, God Within, and Little Wing put it all together on this one. They lift your spirits through a path of ambient, trance, break beat, house, and many other dance music styles. Very intricate mixing... I've been listening to it for 4 yrs and every once in a while, I hear something new. Best to just kick back and let it play..."
4,Hmmmmm,"After all they hype I read about, and timeI spent flipping through cd's, I wasn't asimpressed as I thought I'd be. Maybe I waslooking away from the 1995 release date. Ilove all of the songs, and the CD is mostdefinitely a good CD. My only beef is thatfrom my point of view, the tracks soundold. They are definitely of another era ofproduction, which is fine. A great CD, butI wouldn't pay more than six dollars forit, which is what I did. =)"
3,not bad not bad,"this cd struck me as different in many ways. all 4 tracks sound so different, althought the last two are different renditions of the same song. long hard road was surprisigly better than the original and the trip like i do versions are great. as for track 2..im not too familiar with apollo 440, but the song is not bad. all in all, not a bad buy...good for collector's/fans."
3,1/2 & 1/2,"I didn't care much for the 1st 2 tracks, but, the CD finally paid off because of the last 2 tracks. ""Trip Like I Do"" is a really cool song!"
3,"poor value, just a gimmick","A USB storage device is a generic item available from many, many makers. This one does the same thing as the others, yet costs considerably more than even some famous brands as you can see on the website called ""price watch"". The other features included don't go particularly well with a USB drive -- they are unrelated.The interesting thing with this device is the race: will the pen run out of ink before or after the 128 MB drive is considered obsolete technology?"
2,Buy ASIN: B0002VM8ZM instead - cheaper w/more features,"This piece is really quite over-priced for what you get, though not having the knife allows you to bring this on a plane with you. I've seen this unit marketed elsewhere as a ""travel-friendly"" Swiss Army tool (not knife).Nevertheless, the unit I have is the 64MB version of:ASIN: B0002VM8ZM...which costs considerably less (~$30) on Amazon, has the same 128MB USB drive and red light as the unit on this page, plus you get a small quantity of Swiss Army tools INCLUDING a knife. Unless you are concerned about going on a plane, I'd recommend the ASIN: B0002VM8ZM over the unit on this page. BTW, I got my handy little 64MB unit (which I'd give four stars for if I had the option) for only $9.99 on clearance at Target."
2,Was a bit mislead...,"Maybe I should read the description better, but I was disapointed to find out, when receiving it, that this is JUST a USB Key with a pen and anemic led light.No ""swiss army stuff"". Not even a knife. I thought all swiss army knives are supposed to have, you know, a knife?That said, the USB key is very tiny, almost too small on its own (detached from the swiss army non-knife housing), so it's good it has a ""home"" within the casing, otherwise it would probably go missing."
4,Feels immensely better in the rear end..,However I had to pay a shop 75 dollars an hr which took 4 hrs to install.. @_@ HOLY MOLLY WAS THAT EXPENSIVE!!!!The instructions for this product are very very very basic.. Not in depth at all! I had really hoped to give the shop better instructions but these were just so basic they said they mostly did it by guess work..
1,Mouse has stopped working twice now.,"This keyboard and mouse combo came with my new computer. I've returned it once because the mouse stopped working on the 2nd day that I had been using it. Unfortunately, the replacement mouse stopped functioning a week later. I've been much happier with the Microsoft Wireless 3000 keyboard and mouse."
3,worked great for a while,"This was my first Wireless Mouse/Keyboard experience. I bought this unit for the rechargeable battery feature. The unit worked great for around four months then one day the mouse stopped functioning. I had to basically re-install the entire software/drivers to get the mouse back, then the next day the keyboard started acting up (only the function and enter keys would work). After about 3 hours of troubleshooting, I went back to my USB mouse and keyboard. Like I said the unit worked fine for a while, so maybe it is just me not understandind the way of the wireless..."
3,"Fielding has in-depth characters, & adds twists to the story","I enjoyed this book. I give it 3.5 stars only because the story took me in such a different direction that it was almost disappointing.I did enjoy the story and as usual, Fielding has very good characters, and she builds them right from the opening line. Is Terry imagining that she is being targeted for mistreatment? Or is there a real threat to her life?Her friend, Alison...is she too good to be true? Fielding has a great talent for storytelling, and this one is no exception. It was a good read, but perhaps a bit contrived. Yet, that is what makes the story surprising. (I don't want to give it away....no spoilers here!)If you are a Fielding fan, than this one is for you. I would recommend this book to other readers."
2,disappointing,"I have read every single one of Joy Fieldings books and enjoyed every one of them. I am only happy this was not the first book I read because it would have been the last. I would have missed out on so much. If this was her first book for you, keep trying you will not be disappointed."
1,Horrible,"I don't recall ever feeling this angry at the conclusion of a story. Only a sick, twisted mind could concoct a plot like this and call it good fiction. Not only were the characters unsympathetic, but as others have mentioned, there were inconsistencies and loose ends that were never explained. In summary, as a reader I felt cheated and manipulated."
3,not sure what to say....,"I hardly ever do a review, unless I think a book is really greator really horrible. I like Joy Fieldings books and would recommend them to anyone-but this one really threw me. Like someone elses review-I was disturbed at a certain point and disappointed through the rest. Maybe if I had read the reviews before I read the book Imight have been prepared-but it really was not what I expected. I love good mysterys but this bordered on ""way too strange"" for me. I don't mind different writing style but this left me in a strange mood.But if your like me though, curiosity will get the better of you and you'll want to read it anyway. I suggest the local library, spend your money elsewhere."
1,Whispers and Lies,"This was the most unsatisfying, disappointing book I have ever read. Complete waste of time. Actually, quite stupid."
1,Disappointed,The ending of this book is disturbing to say the least. It started out fine and really pulled me into the story. Very upset how it concluded. I feel I need to read a more uplifting story now.
3,A disappointment compared to other Joy Fielding books,"It was a decent enough book but it lacked the quality that Fielding has intergrated in her other books.The story was confusing and was missing a climax. The ending was not conclusive enough and at the end of the book, you feel betrayed for not getting all the info."
1,Disappointing!!!!,I have read the author before but was not prepared for the hokey storyline. The jacket sounds MUCH more interesting than the book ever was. Nothing could save this book. Save your money!
3,Still Waters Run Very Deeply!,"In this story, the main character Terry, is a nurse living a quiet peaceful, somewhat anti-social existence. That was the case until Allison, an enigmatic 19 year old girl walks into her life wanting to rent the cottage Terry is advertising.The two women supposedly strike up a friendship, but Terry has difficulty trusting Allison very far. They go out to dinners and such, while all the while Terry wonders about Allison.Strange things begin to happen to Terry, and she begins going crazy herself.The book gets stranger from the middle part of it on. Allison seems to bring out the VERY WORST of Terry, and brings out these instincts she never knew she had.The book had holes in the story the more I thought about it. Some of the parts made me wonder why the author wrote it the way she did. It keeps you reading, but it's hard to understand why she created the story as she did."
2,Not as good as the review,"This book was quite honestly very long and drawn out for the first eighteen chapters. Nothing really happened. I guessed who Alison was to Terry very early on and I had a ""so what"" feeling about it. There was not continuity to the plot twist. More suspense was needed. The character of Alison was very shallow. This is one to pass on."
4,Whispers and Lies...,"Well, this was my first experience with Joy Fielding, and I thought it was a pretty good book. I don't read many mystery/thrillers, but I liked this one. It's my understanding that this isn't a typical novel for Mrs. Fielding, that most of her stuff is much lighter and not so...twisted. Either way, I'm looking forward to picking up another one of her books. I liked the writing style, it flowed nicely and made the book fly right by."
3,Loved It . . . Hated It,I loved this book until the last several chapters. I could not put it down! I woke up grabbing it but the ending I found very disappointing. It seemed like a forced plot twist that made no sense. It is definitely worth reading and I have recommended it to others. Just prepare to be aggravated by the ending.
1,absolute trash - waste of time,"I'd never read a JF book before so came into this with no expectations. She is a writer for those who don't read. It was almost written toward high-schoolers - no, that would insult them - every sentence is laced with cheap foreshadowing and theatrical sense of foreboding. The ending (I skipped through much of the book as it was unbelievably predictable) throws facts into the book to make the plot make sense. You can almost hear the fright-flick movie soundtracks in the background reaching a psycho-like crescendo when she stabs the two at the end. Thousands of good books out there - don't bother with this one. Unfortunately I won't be picking up another JF book anytime soon."
4,could be a Lifetime movie!,"I have read just about every book from Joy Fielding. This one may not be as good as the other's, but it certainly is worth reading. My first thought reading this book was ""isn't this a Lifetime movie?"". I thought I knew what was going to happen in the end, but I was left with my mouth wide open. I bet this story will eventually make it to the Lifetime network, but in the meantime settle in for a good read."
2,This book left me feeling depressed,"This was the third book I have read by Joy Fielding. I loved See Jane Run and Grand Avenue, so I had high hopes for Whispers and Lies.Right away I knew this book wasn't going to reach that high, as I disliked the main character, Terry, from the start. Allison wasn't much better -- I found her annoying at best. There's a part when Terry ponders 'listen to your instincts' and, as a reader, you want to yell WHAT DO YOUR INSTINCTS SAY ABOUT A 40-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WHO HANGS OUT WITH 20-SOMETHING DRINKERS AND DRUGGIES?Ranting over, the book isn't bad, but unbelievable. When the ""surprise"" twist at the end finally happens, you think ""A-HA!"" for about a minute, then realize this is just as boring as the first 280 pages.If you are a fan of Fielding, don't hold this book against her. If you've never read a book by her before, don't read this one first. It will turn you against her writing and she has some great stories out there. Read those instead."
2,Whispers and Lies,"I have read all of Joy Fielding's other books and have enjoyed them immensely, which is why I could not wait to read this book. I found it to be very disappointing, unsettling and, quite frankly, ridiculous at times. Looking back, I realize that a lot of it didn't even make sense. I would not recommend this book."
3,I liked this book in the beginning and HATED it in the end.,"While this book was quite a pageturner (I read it in one night), it's ending was quite a twist and really bothered me. It was well written and grabbed the reader's attention and for that I give it 3 stars. BUT ~ the direction in which the book went was terrible and I was upset for hours after I finished it."
2,HATED the ending,I won't summarize the book because too many other people already have. I will say I was intrigued through a lot of the story as to what would be revealed in the end about the intentions of the strange renter. But I was severely disappointed - I feel like the end was a total cop out and a blatant attempt to manipulate the reader. Every time I think about it I'm mad that I read this book. I don't know if I'll try any other Joy Fielding novels; this one left such a bad taste in my mouth I feel like I'd be an idiot to subject myself to it again.
1,Very Disappointing,"After I finished this book last night I felt like I needed to take a long, hot shower. I have read almost every book by this author and enjoyed them for the most part, but this book was the exception.Yes, it was a page turner, but like another reader I kept thinking ""get to the point!"". I could have also done without the animal cruelty, which I had to skip over. The characters, especially Terry the nurse, were very unlikable.When I got the end I felt disgusted. I expect better from this author! And some of the things didn't add up, like Terry's odd reaction to the food and drink on all of the holidays. If you want a cheap read, go ahead and read this but don't expect much."
3,The twist at the end was unexpected.,"I listened to the unabridged audio book on my daily commute and although the reader was excellent, I found myself aggitated with Allison's hyper behavior.I felt it dragged on too much without a clue of why she was so pushy towards Terry and hoping for a close relationship with her. The twist at the end was sudden and I felt it needed to be developed more.My overall feeling was that the story was so-so, I also just finished ""Puppet"" which had some similarities to this one (Florida influence, bad relationship with mother) and I liked ""Puppet"" better."
3,A Puzzling Suspense Story,"This book is an enigma from the beginning. Nothing seems to be as it appears and you are left wondering are the good people evil; are the evil people good? Is Terry Painter,the protagonist really being threatened or drugged ,or is it all in her imagination ? Is Allison, her tenant, really a sweet woman or is she there to wreak havoc on Terry? The story moves along at a fast pace,albeit dragging periodically. The character development is good, but also contradictory in the portrayal of the various characters as the story develops.It is suspenseful, but often unbelievably so in some of the various events. The whole story leads up to a totally twisted, perhaps surprise, ending, which led me to rethink the whole book and wonder if the clues were there all along. Although well written, this is not one of Joy Fielding's better books."
2,Not bad...until last few chapters,"I felt somewhat manipulated after reading this book. The story leads the reader in one direction for the first 3/4 of the book and then does a prompt, unexpected, out-of-nowhere about face in the last several chapters. I have no problem with plot twists...some of the best books and movies have them...but this one occurred in the span of 1 page, came from out of NOWHERE, and didn't fit at all with the book I thought I'd been reading up until that point. The character's demeanors, attitudes, and motives -- developed throughout the story -- completely changed within a few pages with no time for the reader to adjust to or process the consequences within the context of the plot. The degeneration of the plot from that point on was swift and disappointing. Once I'd finished the book and thought back through what I'd read, it almost like these last few chapters had been tacked on from the ending of a different book. Overall, it left me disappointed and unfulfilled."
2,Disappointing,I loved Grand Avenue and was very excited to read this book. It was hard to get into and very unrealistic towards the end. I would not recommend Whispers and Lies.
2,Prize for the dumbest heroine,"I totally agree with the previous reviewer. This is not a book I would have chosen to read if I had known anything about it. The lead charactor is so completely unrealistic. She walks around her house feeling like someone is always peaking in. So how about buying some blinds?! I don't know, I just got tired of everything feeling so phony and absurd."
1,"No, Thank You",This is a terrible book. The part about women 40+ being invisible sounds harmful and sexist. This book should do a disappearing act and remain invisible!The plot is asinine and the characters comtemptable. How could anybody actually enjoy this book?
1,Could not even get half way on this one,"And I am a Joy Fielding fan. The protagonist in Whispers and Lies is such a dang numbskull I just could not stand reading to the end to find out what happens to her. I think she is a few sandwiches short of a picnic, and a moron to boot. I could not relate to her on any level and certainly could not sympathize with her."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!,I have read every other book by this author and loved them. This was a terrible and depressing book! I will certainly not buy her lastest book (Lost) until I read customer reviews!!!
4,"Small, pretty and great sound","I wanted something to be able to play my IPOD while I work in the kitchen, without a mess of speakers and wires. This is compact with tremendous sound, no set-up involved at all... just plug it in, insert IPOD, enjoy.Great product!"
2,"At first yes, but then not so much","I have had this speaker system for about a year and it worked very well at first. Then when I tried to put a different kind of iPod in it, it skrewed up and ended up freezing the iPod. The sound wouldn't work and if it did, it would have a clicking noise in the background. I put my old one in there and it skrewed that one up also. I ended up having to get a new iPod. If you are looking for a one iPod speaker for not very long, then it is alright, but not many people are."
5,Great speakers for iPod,I am very pleased and satisfied with this item due to the flexibility that the size and sound gives for a very reasonable investment.
2,sounds great but will not charge 4G nano,I bought this three months ago (for $65) for use with my iPod classic. I was very pleased with the sound. I use it in my home office for personal listening and found the volume more than adequate for that use. This can play music with reasonable fidelity at volumes much higher than I care to listen to music!However my love affair with this product is now over. Yesterday my new iPod nano 4G arrived and I was extremely disappointed to find that this dock will not charge the 4G nano. Meaning it is essentially obsolete. Do yourself a favor and buy a dock that is compatible with the newest iPods.
4,Great sound for the value,This is our second speaker of this type that we've purchased; still have the first one. We were impressed with the fidelity of sound and the compact size. A great value and crystal clear sound!
5,its a good book,I had to read this book for a history class in college and I learned a lot about how things were back then and how they have changed. Plan on reading the book again when i have more time and not have to do a rush read on it.
5,Triangle: The Fire that Changed America,"The book came in the mail promptly. I was very pleased with the condition of the book. I will buy from this seller again, if the opportunity arises."
3,Don't miss the film about the Triangle Fire,"I recently saw a PBS documentary called, ""Three Miracles,"" about the Triangle Fire. Wow! It is an amazing account of the fire and its aftermath told by the last survivor, 107-year-old Rose Freedman. This film is part of Barbra Streisand's ""THE LIVING CENTURY"" series: ..."
4,The more things change....................,"Just finished Triangle the Fire That Changed America by David Von Drehle. Great book - got better as it went. Billed as a social history, it addresses the factory fire that killed 140 workers in NYC in 1911. I have a big hole in my knowledge about history when it comes to that era, so glad I read it. Addressed unions, suffragettes, Tammany Hall, told through the lives of these people and their involvement in these issues specifically around the fire, including a lookback at their home countries and reason for immigrating. In a different time, I might have perceived it as a success story about unions and worker safety, but here we are in 2011 continuing on with greedy politicians and corporations, dirty legal tricks, still sending people to die in unsafe mines, and destroying unions again. Too sad."
5,Very factual,"I purchased the audable edition of this book. The reader is wonderful. The story is very sad but true. This was the fire that caused the creation of fire safety laws and regulations.What we take for granted today in the way of workplace safety was not the norm at the time of the Triangle fire. This book will make clear some of the reasons behind laws like not locking in your employees, adequite fire escapes, and clearly marked exit doors.This book is extremely emotion provoking, but there is no way to write a book on so deadly a fire without provoking tears."
4,In keeping with the Ellen Tracy aesthetic = Office-Appropriate & Pleasant.,"ET opens as a clean, clear, bright fruity-floral that is just a tad powdery, almost soap-like, and quite sweet. The white florals get amplified on my skin as it moves to the heart, so it's not wearable in warm weather for me. As it dries down, ET seems to show a gourmand character, very much like Omnia - both are classified as oriental woodies, though. This gourmand-like dry-down is my favorite aspect of this fume, and what makes it special & unique, imo.Everything that I've tried (or own) in the Ellen Tracy fragrance line is office-appropriate. ET is no exception. If you're looking for an office fragrance, you could do worse than this one. I like it ... a lot ... but not enough to own it."
4,Nice product at a good price. Smells very nice...,I continue to use this product for its nice subtle scent. Not overwhelming at all.
1,Not Ellen Tracy,"Don't know what this is, but it in not Ellen Tracy. ET was my favorite perfume and was so upset when theydiscontinued it. I should have known better. Sad part is, I can't even return it!"
4,Tantalizing Scent,"I love this soft, sophisticated and delightful musky women's fragrance that combines oriental floral tones with spices and subtle woodsy undertones. It is not overbearing. It is a tantalizing scent that will last through the night."
5,"A scent that lingers, but never over-powers","Ellen Tracy by Ellen Tracy is one of those subtle, lovely, old-South fragrances from the past that says ""Rich & Romantic"" in the same breath. I have had an EXTREME problem with almost every fragrance I've encountered for years. Some have even caused Asthma attacks, but this one doesn't offend my nose, breathing, or skin at all. My first encounter with Ellen Tracy was a fragrance sample from an O magazine. I fell in love with it from the start, but I waited for a reaction because I figured it was coming. To my delight & surprise...NO REACTIONS!!!!!! I purchased the body powder, then the cologne & body cream when I could no longer find the body powder...and I really miss it. :( If there's a way I could find to make it myself, I would! Any suggesstions?"
1,fake,not the real thing...very disappointed..don't buy it...not worth the cheap price...it does not last more than a second after spraying on..terrible product..ripoff
2,Fake,This product is a counterfeit! Don't waste your money. It lasts only few mintues. My mom has the real Hellen Tracy perfume and it stays a long time. Even the bottle looks different. It explains why the price is so cheap. I learned not to get too excited over cheap prices here.
3,"Great scent, not great bottle.",The spray bottle doesn't work well. Have to jiggle and turn it after every squirt to get it to squirt again. Hope it doesn't stop working all together before the perfume is gone.
3,Overrated but readable,"I'm a bit puzzled by all the positive reviews of Buckskin Brigades. Did we all read the same book? This is definitely not top notch fiction. Yellow Hair is a white man raised by Blackfeet, who eventually encounters ""his own kind,"" with fireworks resulting. There isn't much plot to speak of, the action isn't gripping, and as usual for Hubbard the characters are pretty shallow. I do remember enjoying it somewhat, but for a relatively short book (c. 300 pages) it sure does drag on. Almost the only part worth recommending is that it's sort of an ""anti-Western,"" in that the whites are depicted as the bad guys. Pretty unusual for the mid-30s, and a refreshing perspective even now. Other than that, this book isn't terrible, but IMO it's not worth more than a library browse."
1,Unreadable,"I really didn't like it and couldn't finish it. I could have perservered to the end, but life is too short"
3,"Jack Marconi, private eye","Jack Marconi, a former prison warden turned private eye, is trying to get over his wife's death. This is not an easy task as he feels the accident was meant for both of them and he is still alive.Trying to move on, he has a case of an author who is locked in a Mexican prison when she was on assignment. He finds she might be connected to his wife's death. Will he break her out of jail? Will he find his wife's killer? Can you figure it out before the book ends? Read Godchild and see."
2,Blech!,"What happened? Did somebody tell Zandri his first ""Keeper"" novel wasn't spicy enough? Needed more doses of salaciousness, more surrealism, more weird plot, more dumb? Boo, hiss! I very much enjoyed my introduction to Zandri's work, but frankly, I do not think I will bother finishing this one. Very disappointed, and that's a fact. When the reader finds him/herself suddenly muttering, ""Oh, for Pete's sake,"" snapping the book -- or the Kindle -- closed, and finding something else to do, over and over again, it's time to move on."
2,Unbelievable,"I'm sorry, but this is totally unbelievable. This guy is dumb enough to let the bad guy shoot him, stab him and anything they want, by always beating him to the draw. Also, his bud Tony is supposed to be this really top notch, lawyer-type and he lets the bad guys pull the wool over his eyes with the whole dean and also steal the main character right out from under his nose. I don't think so!"
2,boring,this book is so slow and has way to much detail. i have skipped big chunks of the book just to get to a decent part i am not sure i will finish it..why did some people give this five stars ? i give it two and that is being nice...thank god it was only 99 cents...
2,godchild,"Just another drunk ""PI"" story. Is this guy really missing? (see forward and About the Author in the paperback edition of this book)"
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"This book is the second in a series, and to be honest, I didn't love the first. I do not find the main character very likable at all, and when I can't relate to a character, I really struggle getting through a book. The story is fast paced, violent and a little too overdramatic for my taste. In my opinion, it read like a tv drama series not a novel. That may be interesting to some, but it's just not my cup of tea."
2,Godchild,"GODCHILD came from Amazon and it was not a good read! The storyline(s) is disjointed and the characters are not believable at all...there is a story of a wife's murder by hit and run driver...story of a prison warden who had become a private investagator...a story of a baby being drowned in a bath tub...a story of a woman writer on the run while writing a story about drug trafficing...story of a woman left at the altar...and others in this one book. I cannot recommend this read to anyone and although I could not say I hated it, I had to say I did not like it.Godchild"
2,cute but cheep,"These have bad wires, eat up 4 AA batteries like nothing & are not very bright at all. Save your money, I wish I did!"
1,Tinkerbell night light,There were supposed to be two lights in the package. Only one was shipped. The shipping cost as much as the light. Junk from China!
3,The Cannibal Queen is a vegetarian,"""The Cannibal Queen"" is an okay book, but something was missing for me. Or maybe Stephen Coonts added a little too much - too much people stuff. Stephen was a little too polite, showed a little bit too much political correctness, and definitely focused too much on the people he met. Stephen Coonts is no Richard Collins (""Flying Magazine"") or Leighton Collins (Richard's father and the founder of ""Air Facts Magazine""). If you want to read some good Stephen Coonts books skip ""The Cannibal Queen"" and read ""Flight of the Intruder,"" and ""The Intruders.&quot"
1,A mediocre book about someone flying somewhere.,"I thoroughly enjoyed 'Flight of the Intruder', and eagerly looked forward to reading this one. Unfortunately, as he stated in the beginning of the book, his publisher bought the book before he took the trip -- it shows. The possibilities of a 48-state flying/father-son Stearman journey across America immediately races towards Boredom Field and crashes short of the runway. I got very tired of hearing about the minutia of the ground-time versus the exciting world of flight. The more I read, the more I was hoping it'd get better. The story didn't focus on the point of writing/reading the book (at least not the first 1/4 when I quit.) Don't waste your time reading this book. This is a great book if you owe someone money for writing a story about flying. And Mr. Publisher -- Pay after you read it next time."
3,"Not ""the best general aviation book in print""","This book is entertaining and I enjoyed reading it, but it is not in the same league as e.g. Richard Bach's A Gift of Wings.The audiotape version, which I recently obtained from the local lending library, really highlights the author's more banal observations and the book's lack of structure. I had to turn it off halfway through the first cassette - a first for me!It's not a bad book, and I'm pleased to have it in my personal library. I don't agree with OmarUSAF's suggestion that it is boring; but it cannot reasonably be considered a classic. Mariana Gosnell's Zero 3 Bravo and (especially) Rinker Buck's Flight of Passage are better accounts of flying across America."
2,disappointing,"As a licensed private pilot I have often dreamed of doing just what the author did, i.e. rent a vintage airplane, take a whole summer off and fly around the entire United States. So, when I saw this book I bought it immediately and settled in for a vicarious thrill.Unfortunaely, the author describes almost no contact with the local people and only passing mention of the scenery he flies over. His mission apperars to be simply to touch down in every State and then fly on to the next airport; mission accomplished. He lands, goes to a nearby restuarant, has a hamburger (""it was good"") and flies on.There are many writers out there who have traveled the USA by motorcycle, car or boat (see William Heat-Moon's ""River Horse"")and have managed to write a fascinating account of their adventures. This book is very cut and dry and left me wanting more. Maybe someone will take the same trip some summer and write a book worth reading."
2,Not consistent!,"I realize overall trends are more important than anything else, but, I'm pretty unhappy with just how much this scale varies. It can vary weighing yourself twice by up to 8 pounds! It's really hard to track trends when you dont know if the number you get it +/- 8 pounds at any given time.I've owned it a couple years, and it's got other flaws - it chews through batteries of the expensive watch type, and i've had to open it several times to clean the circuit board inside with alcohol- it gets wet and when the water dries it reads Err or E untill I take it apart."
2,Not the best for consistency,"I bought this scale because I am a Weight Watcher member. However, every time I step on the scale I get a different reading. Sometimes it can be as much as 2 lbs different than the scale at my meetings! I know that most scales are different but this is far too much for me."
1,,"Unless you're a completist and can tolerate tons of metalcore bands, the horrible Six Feet Under and the ridiculous black metal band Ancient, there's really no need for you to have this video compilation. There's at least 3 good songs in here that are accompanied by some great visuals: Amon Amarth's ""Death in fire""(finally a listenable song from this band), Brainstorm's ""Highs without lows"" (great heavy metal song, period) and Cattle Decapitation's ""To serve man""(brutal death metal that actually sounds evil, backed up by some cool video effects). The director for Cannibal Corpse's video could have come up with a much more mature concept for their video. I guess the mediocre song complements the video. The other clips are more or less professionally done. I'm not really surprised by the amount of metalcore bands on Metal Blade's roster. However, I am still confused as to how Six Feet Under got so popular all these years by playing some of the most boring and monotonous death metal ever."
2,Generic insulator for exhaust systems.,"This is a generic rubber insulator for exhaust systems. If your original hangar looks like it, it may work fine foryou. But the ones on my Chrysler PT Cruiser are a different design and much more flexible. After changing the intermediate pipeand replacing the three insulators, it only took 9 months for two of them to crack clean through, leaving my muffler hanging bya thread. I'm ordering 3 replacements from Chrysler and would advise you to do the same."
4,I pretty much just love the Duggars,"I enjoy watching the Duggars TV show. This DVD is no exception, and I am happy to have it as these episodes don't rerun anymore. What more can I say?"
5,An acoustic treasure chest!!!,"As a longtime fan of Jimmy Somerville, I'd like to personally attest to this being his finest work. I have quite the varied range of musical tastes and this album easily makes my top 10 favorite album list. It is a crime that this CD has not received more airplay. I hope this fact will not prevent record companys from releasing future albums by this wonderful artist.Do not let the fact that Jimmy sings in falsetto keep you from giving this amazing singer a listen. He is one of the greatest vocalist of our lifetime, with a strong dynamic range. (No I do not know him and I am not related to him.) I am just a huge fan of his vocal styling, who loves the fact his music has matured as he has, without losing a single bit of his vocal strength."
3,"Mott without ""the Hoople""","I could see why a lot of MTH fans might not like this - with the departure of Ian Hunter it's certainly a whole new ball game. I don't remember the new vocalists' name(s) but one of them has a high pitched wail that I kind of like. I think the bass player from MTH (Overend Watts) does vocals on a few tunes as well. Overall some pretty darn catchy rock in the classic rock mode, with some decent ballads thrown in. The song Great White Wail & It Takes One to Know One could have been hits back in the day if they had the right promotion. I burned my vinyl copy onto cd a couple of years ago when I couldn't find this on disc. Worth checking out for fans of MTH or similar 70s rock."
3,"Underated with, for them, better than average songs overall, but no great one's (I think)","Although by mid 1976 Mott the Hoople were past their popular fame prime this is not a bad album (although maybe not as 'groundbreaking' as previous one's), no song that really stands out though, unlike most of their albums (although 'By Tonight' is a close candidate). Like many bands who cease being fame-darlings of pop society this underrated LP is now overlooked by the finkle public (although it has a few boring meandering songs on it too).I GIVE IT: 2.8-3.3 STARS (depending on my mood)Note: Mott The Hoople were one of those bands that (mostly) always seemed to have one really good or brilliant song that made up for all the rest on their LPs (each LP having 1-2 other good songs, 1-2 OK/good ones, and the rest boring).My favorite sonic proto-timeless Mott songs:Crash Street Kids (Mott LP, 1974)Death May Be Your Santa Claus (Brain Capers LP, 1970)"
2,The Bones of the Hoople,"They really should have known better, but they tried it anyway. Mott was out to prove they could keep the motor running with out either Ian Hunter or Ariel Bender (not to mention the even earlier departed Mick Ralphs). Although they nearly succeeded with the subsequent release ""Shouting and Pointing"", ""Drive On"" merely serves to drive home the point of how essential Hunter, Ralphs, et al, were to the band. One good song (the opening cut) followed by uninspired thrashing and noodling about. Skip this one."
3,Killing sexy,A mentally questionable crim is impersonalising policeman while doing own business. Actor's atural handsomeness adds to the nice performing of a rather dull story.
5,miami blues,Alec Baldwin is at his best as he plays a psychopathic character in this fast paced action drama. Ingenuity and being nice to his new found girlfriend are the only disirable qualities in Baldwin's character. You won't want to leave your seat with this one.
2,Predictable,"Is anyone really surprised by anything about this movie? The plot is standard fare. The acting is ok, especially Fred Ward. If you want to catch a young Alex Baldwin and some nudity by Jennifer Jason Leigh, then go ahead and rent this. No need to buy. I got it out of the library, better yet."
4,"Original, quirky, dark, and funny","Not quite a great film, but an entertainingly odd and unique one. Fullof rough violence and noir situations played as dark comedy.Alec Baldwin is very good indeed as a killer sociopath who somehow isalso very likable when he's not robbing and beating people. Fred Wardis terrific as the scraggly cat of a cop who chases Baldwin down afterBaldwin steals his badge, gun and false teeth, and starts to run aroundpretending to be a cop himself. And Jennifer Jason Leigh underplays togreat effect as a pretty, dumb hooker, who falls for Baldwin, anddoesn't figure out just what kind of guy he is until very late in thegame. That said, it doesn't add up to a lot emotionally, Leigh's roleis underwritten, and there are several gaping logic holes the film justignores (Ward has dinner early on with Baldwin and Leigh, clearly knowshe's a criminal, but just leaves?!?)But all that said, I've seen it twice, and fully enjoyed myself both times."
4,Good but innacurate in one crucial point,"There is only ONE problem with this book, albeit a very big problem. While the author rightly calls St. Peter the first pope, the first successor of Jesus Christ, it goes on to make a glaring error in the following sentence: ""Our present Holy Father is the successor of St. Peter."" Why is this an error? Because the Chair of Peter is currently empty. Benedict XVI is a manifest heretic who, by that very fact, cannot be pope. Information proving this point can be found on the Catholic website: Vatican Catholic . com"
2,"Nice, but tight over the knee","Nice stockings, but not if you are overweight.I purchased these for my mother who weighed about 110 pounds, at 4'10"". She did have a problem with leg swelling. The tops of these stockings were too tight for her, cutting off her circulation, and she couldn't wear them. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend them for anyone whose legs are stocky or that has a circulation problem."
2,Material and the finish is not as good as it looks,The fit and finish of this jeans is not what it looks like in the product image. Returned the item immediately.
4,fit,"These are a nice flexible, soft fabric. Unfortunately, we are of the large-thighed build. This ""loose fit"" did not have enough room through the crotch. We have purchased Nautica's Big E-Z Jean in the past and they had enough room for our big-boned big-muscled build. So we returned these and purchased the Big E-Z."
2,Just a Little Loose for the Size. Low High-Quality Stitching and Material,"For loose fit jeans, these are below standard. Everything about them signals very low quality including fit, appearance and construction.First, what I got is more flared out at the bottom of the leg than the picture. It has 5 beltloops, instead of the standard 7. The material is quite thin and looks cheap in the blue color I selected, contrary to the product photo. The stiching is poor and obviously so.The maker, Nautica, brands itself to reflect the adventure and tradition of exploration of the world by sailboats of a bygone era. These jeans are a bit wide at the bottom of the leg and do slightly suggest the wide pants ending in a bell that the U.S. Navy began to wear in the early nineteenth century. However, the material and overall fit betray the branding idea.I cannot recommend these jeans for the above reasons."
1,Wears way to quickly.,"I'm so disappointed with Nautica jeans. I find that they are getting worn out too quickly, even when they are being worn in an office setting."
1,Not as good as the faded version,The darker color of these and new style are horrible compared to the original faded blue. This new version looks like crap! a black pair of Levis would be better.
4,Great for summer!,"I dont really write reviews but I have a pair of these jeans and yes! they are bigger sized. I recommend you try them in the store if you can. I usually wear a 42x32 but with Nautica Loose fit I fit in 38x32 fine. I love these jeans because they are baggy and great for the summer. The material is ok which is why I didn't give it 5 starts, but I have had these jeans for about a year and a half now and they just started to rip a bit. Still great jeans that are worth it. Just remember to check your size!"
2,WAY LONG,I bought a 38x32 (the same jeans I buy at the Nautica outlet). The jeans came in as a 38x32 but the legs are REALLY long.Materials appear to be a bit cheaper than the average Nautica jeans I have bought in the past.
3,LITTLE SLOW!,"This ia about Ben Thompson, a gambler, shootist and a lawman. It dawns on him one day that he has really nothing good to be remembered for and decides to run for Marshall of Austin. He, of course wins, and is soon making people follow the law. The story jumps about with him leaving Austin two different times. He is true to his friends and this gets him in trouble more than once. Was not Marshall long and decided to quit, has not happy doing the job. Book was a little slow to me with several dead pages. Think Braun has done better."
5,Can't live without it.,"A friend bought me my first Gerber LST II. It stayed in my pocket for several years, providing excellent service whenever I called upon it. I finally wore out the case (it was with my keys and a multitool). I got this one to replace it. The knife holds an edge without any problem and is very easy to open. Highly recommended."
3,Slim in pocket,"If you want slim and light, this will certainly do it. I didn't like the slight looseness of the blade or the way it's mounted, which can't be tightened as other light weight riveted knives can be if needed. The handle is less ergonomic feeling than it looks, but is still A-OK. Back to the slim/light part, which is it's greatest advantage, and why it doesn't feel as good as it could in hand. It's a trade off between being just a bit thicker or disappearing in your pocket so you keep checking to see if it's there. My blade needed sharpening out of the pkg, others have not. At $20 not bad, but since it's so similar in materials and construction to the orig LST's I don't see why it's priced higher just because the design is different."
5,Great CD,"Brand new cd,with very nicely produced songs from one of my favorite artists. Very good price,and I would recommend this to my friends."
1,PUT BACK THE TRANS FAT IDIOTS,"NABISCO I USED TO ENJOY THE SOCIAL TEA BISCUT FOR OVER 40 YEARS. BUT YOU DESTROYED THIS COOKIE WITH YOUR POLITICAL CORECTNESS, THANKS TO THAT JERK MIKE BLOOMBERG, TELLING YOUR COMPANY TO TAKE ALL TRANS FAT OUT OF YOUR COOKIE.WELL PAL YOU LOST A CUSTOMER.I WOULD RATHER EAT THE BOX, THAN THE NEW SOCIAL TEA COOKIE. YOU ARE JERKS JUST LIKE MIKE BLOOMBERG WITH HIS 20 BILLION DOLLARS. CONGRATUALTIONS, THE LITTLE GUY CANNOT EVEN ENJOY A COOKIE WITH HIS CUP OF COFFEE ANY MORE."
3,LOVE THESE COOKIES,"as much as i love these cookies,it's cheaper to buy 6 boxes in the store. this is not something i consider a bargain and that is the only reason why i rated them a 3...they are delicious but not at this price!!!"
4,Nekromantix - 'Life Is A Grave & I Dig It!' (Hellcat),"Danish psychobilly trio - saw these guys open for Rob Zombie. Have to admit, they definitely rock out. Tunes that drew me in were ""Horny In A Hearse"", the Stray Cats-ish ""My Girl"", ""Voodoo Shop Hop"", ""Flowers Are Slow"" and the rocking ""Fantazma"". Line-up: Kim Nekroman - bass & vocals, Frano - guitar and Lux - drums. Should do a lot for fans and loyal followers of Reverend Horton Heat, the Cramps and Nerve Agents. Overall, not a bad pick."
4,digging sound,"Nek has changed a little bit (Hellbound is my favorite) but they are still good, i just got this cd and i like it. if u are a fan of nekromantix dont skip this one."
5,Great MUSIC,"This is my favorite psychobilly album by a long shot. It has more catchy hooks than their older albums, but does not seem to lose anything in the psycho department. I LOVE this album and I know more people would as well if they had only heard of the band. Give these guys, especially this album, a chance!"
3,Hellcat......,Hellcat Records boinks up everything they touch including Nekromantix's Lifes a Grave. Too bad. I hope it isn't fatal for the band.Not one Gargoyles over Copenhaven or Moonchaser....a real disappointment.
1,Not Worth it....,"Disappointing album all in all. The songs are weak and the lyrics even worse.What the hell happened to you Kim?Hellbound, Brought Back To Life, Curse of The Coffin and even some tracks on Return were awesome albums.This one's a complete let down."
4,Gavin's still dancin',"This has to be one of my favorite albums of all time, right after downtown battle mountain. If your expecting the same generic CHUG CHUG guitar work on a lot of other Post-hardcore bands, be disappointed. the guitar work is excellent and pretty progressive. And then to put the cherry on this album are jonny craig and jon mess's vocals. Jon's screaming does seem a bit distorted and hard to understand, normally you can hear what he's saying in new albums, but it makes the album what it is. If anyone is new to dance gavin dance, dont be put off by the production, take a listen to 'downtown battle mountain' and you'll be reassured they can deliver great things."
2,too basic for my needs,"According to the reviews this book was very complete and had good material for our kids.The book is too basic, it provides exhaustive recommendations on how to plan the conversations with your kids.Unless you don't have any idea on how to start a normal conversation with your kids, then this book it would besuitable for you, otherwise, this book spends more time on the preparation to the theme than giving advices oncurrent situations that are happening to our kids."
1,Sloppy at best,"Perhaps he does ""bring classical music to life"", if by that we mean flawed and uninspiring. I do not think that anyone really disputes that this is a touching story, but as a musician and pianist, Mr.Helfgott falls well short. I recently saw him in concert, and was dismayed by his sloppy playing and poor technique. There are many other cds one should buy to hear the true beauty of this piece, and I would not recommend this one."
1,boring,"BAD. I bought three books on amazon to find the best one, and ""my cat's journal"" by aaron hunt was by far the best, get that one."
4,Worked,"It worked for my LG my touch Q, might buy another to make my phone even better.shipping was average. easy to install."
4,Works well,The antenna booster was very easy to install and gave me a 2 bar increase in my reception everywhere. As long as you follw the simple instructions it will work to your expectations no matter if you are in the wilderness or a sub basement.
3,"I dont think it works for smart phones or ""high tech"" phones we have today",I tried it on my Iphone 4 and it didnt work. I have college at Pasadena and in the buildings I have to no reception. Maybe its just the Iphone 4 s antenna problem. Becuase of that I thought this would work. But it didnt. Oh wells worth a try. I got two for a dollar so I cant complain.
1,How can Amazon recommend these worthless junk,Worthless Junk! Total waist of time and money. Might as well put a GI Joe band aid on my phone.
1,sux ass,This product is a scam and does not work.. take my advice and don't buy this thing. La la la
2,did not work as advertised.,"this product did not work in my home. but,for a dollar i had to try it.try 2 mabe that will work."
2,cell phone booster,"These arrived in good time, but don't seem to make much difference for my cell phone's reception."
1,Stinks,"This thing doesn't even work a little.... Don't waste your time, energy, or money with this thing. You may think: ""it's just a couple of dollars what the heck"", but it will be a couple of dollars wasted."
1,Waste of money!!,"This thing is a waste of paper, it doesn't give u any better reception. This is a total rip off in my book :-("
1,No llegó!!,"Compré este producto y nunca llegó a mis manos, no lo recomiendo para nada!! Se perdió en el camino o tal vez el vendedor nunca lo envió. Pésimo, pésimo, no lo recomiendo. Es una estafa!"
2,Half baked Idea,"First of all this is a tricky item. Sometimes it might work sometimes it won't. If you can find it super cheap then get a bunch of them, because that's the only way you'll see a massive change. I only used I think one or two, but I know that I did see a small change between using this and not. I may havent only gotten one solid bar, but it was better then having to stand at my dorm window to receive or send anything.Pro: it works...even if its small,Cheap,easy to put onCons:Need more then 1 to see a major difference,flimsy,cheap"
1,Worthless,"I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this useless antenna booster. I do wish I had invented it, I'd be a millionaire ! I'm surprised Amazon allows useless inventions to be sold on their website."
1,awful,this thing is awful does not work! i put it on as soon as i received it absolutely no difference !
1,Waste,"This is a complete waste of money, and i'm more upset that i didn't know any better. I was so desperate to get service on my phone where i live i was willing to try anything. This sticker is simply a sticker. There is no antenna boost."
3,Seems to help a little so far...,"i'm just wondering if it'll help for real though. ive been able to recieve texts in dead zone areas more often although not always. not a total waste i suppose, it was only about 2 bucks anyway"
1,dont get this,"i have received, and even had a Verizon tech help me install this, and it didnt do a dang thing. i would not recommend getting this item as it is not even worth your time and money."
4,it actually gives me an extra bar !,"I thought they were silly too, but I get an extra bar!I would recommend this product.I will buy one for each phone."
1,Waste of money,well it shipped very fast but i didnt see a difference in my signal. But who knows maybe it works for other people. And some more words to complete this review.
4,cellular innovations A- Booster,"I bought tis booster for my phone because I needed better recepion, I tryed it and it made my phone come in a little better I would buy is product again, if fact I bought one for the whole family."
4,It works,"I wouldn't say it's the best thing ever, but I put two on there, and now I've got reception in a lot of places I didn't before. Definitely worth the money. I can use my phone indoors now!"
1,"I knew it wouldn't work but thought, what the heck!","After reading all the reviews, I knew this would not work but thought I would try it anyway. Some people thought it worked for them so maybe it would work for me. I ended up pulling it off while I was out and about because it actually dropped a bar on me!! Oh well, $1.25 thrown away.."
5,booster,"easy to use and it does boost my signal my phone kept dropping calls, but this booster helps me to call when I need to and the calls are crystal clear unlike before when they sounded garbelled."
3,Eh...,"It is easy to apply, but I am not so sure that is really works that well. I have used it on another phone and it made a difference, but not with my Galaxy 3."
2,Soso,"Works on some phones, others not a bit. Can't believe these are even sold yet... Got them for all my family and friends. Not worth getting in my honest opinion."
2,Use on my G2 Cell phone,"I did not see any determinate difference in my service in different areas, has no effect for internet service and little if any effect for cell signal. best to just invest in a portable repeater."
1,Nothing to see here.....,"I thought I would have just give it a try, it's just one dollar! So I read the reviews and there were mostly 1 stars and a couple of 2 or up. I ended up getting it hoping that most people were wrong but when I tried it exactly how I was supposed to it didn't work! I went to an area that has no signal but could have signal and then I went to a spot that had a more open area.....still nothing! So for those people that are thinking about buying this thing: it's only one dollar so your not going to lose a lot AND if it's a flip phone it'll probably work better because it only mentions flip phones. Not querky keyboard, smart phones, and just different phones from a flip. It's a little out dated of an item."
1,Electronic Snake Oil,"Stop wasting your money. This is electronic snake oil!!! I'm an engineer with over 35 years experience in RF communication. Trust me; this device will do nothing to improve your reception. In fact if it does anything, it might actually detune your cell phones internal antenna and decrease its performance.The cell phone industry is extremely competitive. Cell phone manufactures spend tens of millions of dollars designing their phones for optimum performance. They employ some of the finest engineering minds in the world. Doesn't logic tell you that if a few bits of foil could dramatically improve a phones performance they would have already incorporated it into their designs?"
1,Quack Device,"Folks, this is nothing more than a sticker with a design on it.It can in no way, and does in no way improve reception at all.They were selling these for $20, now I see they are down to $1, and even that is a rip off, unless you are a collector of quack devices, in which case, you must have this for your collection of quack devices from this century.I am keeping mine in it's bubble package and display it on the wall near my test bench.One day these will be worth something as collectors items, but don't get one beleiving that it can actually do what it claims, because that is physically impossible."
1,A tradiotional American CON JOB,These things are just a confidence trick. They don't do a thing. They can't do a thing. If you believe these make your phone work better then you probably find the stripes down the side of cars make them go faster too.
1,Never got it...,"Don't bother with ordering this product. I never got one. When I wrote a bad review they emailed me and told me it got lost in the mail, never got the product. I hope people fight this bad company."
1,Not Worth $1,"The booster antenna Does not work, it actually makes cell service worse rather than better. Do not buy this product. It doesn't work at all."
1,Did it work?,"This product was reviewed well so I bought it, but I honestly couldn't see a diffrence when I purchased it for my daughter. My calls are always dropped or I can hear every 2 words she says. I am not happy with this product."
5,expectations,"this ""booster"" was originally sold under the claim that ""it's like adding a three foot antenna to your cell phone."" well way back then... 5 years ago, cell antennas weren't that great to begin with and this little ""sticker"" did add a bit more reception to the cell phones of yore. nowadays cell antenna techonology has made antennas smaller and better... but not perfect. adding this ""booster"" to a relatively new phone won't add three bars to your reception... it probably won't even add one bar, but it does clear up your calls in areas where you have service. this thing isn't going to bend cell towers towards you to increase your calling area, it just holds the signal better in places where you can get service. if you live miles from a tower's sphere of influence this thing won't get you reception at your home, but it will make for a better conversation when you only have one bar.as far as i can tell, it does what it's supposed to do."
5,Automatic increase in bar signal!!!!!,Don't listen to these people claiming the product doesn't work! A lot of them admit that they didn't test the product. I tested the product (because the apartment I moved into doesn't give me good reception). I was pretty skeptical but decided to buy it.I gained an extra bar of signal strength after placing the sticker on my phone (the spot beneath where the battery is) and turning it back on. You can check it out on youtube if you want.[...]
3,It works.,Mine was delivered while it was pouring rain. I had no 3G signal due to the weather. I put it on as instructed and noticed I suddenly had a bar and could go online with no hesitation. I've since orderd two more for other family members. I think it's worth it for the price.
3,for a buck it is worth it. improves cheep or old phones,"I have not dropped a call in my bedroom since i got it so it did something. it seems to have done what it said, doubled my reception of barley anything to two barley anythings.Newer phones all ready have similar technology built in so the difference will be very minimal. It worked fantastic on 5 year old phone."
4,Signal Booster,It has helped me to be able to sit in my chair in my living room and use my cell phone. I still have some prpblems but it has to do with where I live.
1,I had to returned it to Amazon,Basically this is review for the Amazon pricing and not the item itself. I had to returned it to Amazon as it was being sold at 1/10th of the price on the competition site. I requested Amazon for full review but they didn't. They cut the shipping etc charges.
1,a piece of junk,Junk junk junk does not work junk junk junk trash no worth the dollar sell a million make a million :) I had to try it.
3,No Impact,This product did not change my signal quality one way or another. I suspect this was more because of my phone and my service provider than because of the booster. Cricket CellM8 phone with Cricket service.
1,not worth it,"we needed a better signal and thought at $2.99 for a 10 pack would be worth a shot. well, they say you get what you pay for and that was certainly true in this case! expect nothing from this product and you won't be disappointed! really, don't bother. if you really need a boost for a signal, i recommend checking your other options. don't waste your time or money."
1,Junk,Do not buy this product it is just junk and they keep the price low enough so you will buy it without having to worry about losing your shirt if it doesn't work. Trust me it really doesn't work.
2,Didn't work,"For 99 cents and free shipping, I had to give this product a try because of the poor signal in my home. I currently have a G2 smartphone which allows me to actually see the signal strength in menu -> settings -> about phone -> status. Before putting on the booster sticker, I held my phone the way I normally do when I talk. I stared at the signal strength for 5 minutes and noticed my signal fluccuated between -109 dBm (one bar signal) and -101 dBm (two bars signal). After following the directions for putting on the booster sticker, I once again stared at the signal strength for 5 minutes holding my phone in the exact same position as before. With the sticker on, I noticed that the signal was still the same betweeen -109 and -101 dBm. I gave this product 2 stars because it at least doesn't have any negative effects."
1,Does Nothing But Interfere With 4G Signal,"I rarely write product reviews, but I feel like I should warn others about purchasing and using this product. I have had success using this antennae booster on my feature phone (aka dumb phone), giving me an extra bar. There were several occasions when I was able to make calls with zero bars. ZERO!So after getting my HTC Thunderbolt from Verizon, I thought I'll give this booster another try and see if it'll enhance my reception. Instead, it killed data reception. I lost 4G and even 3G connection. I should've known not to mess with the internal antennae of the phone. Once I peeled off the booster, my 4G was fine again! Buyers/Users beware!"
3,Cellular Innovations A-BOOSTER Universal Cell Phone Antenna Booster,"didn't work for one phone but did for another, good price, shipped promptly, nothing more to say, except this is ridiculous that I am required to say anything in order to rate this product."
4,Depends on the Phone,"I've used this product on about 7 phones over that many years with my family. I've tested phones without it and with it in several places of my office, my home, my basement and my back yard. With a couple of the phones it made no impact. With 5 of the phones (LG/Samsung/Kyocera) I got between 1 and 2 more bars. Placement is critical."
5,excellent steering rack bushings,"Ordered these for my 2000 Toyota 4Runner 4WD and everything fit very nicely. The Amazon vehicle guide indicated these bushings would not work on the 3rd gen 4Runners (96-02), but upon further research on both the Energy Suspension website, and multiple 4Runner enthusiast websites, I found that Amazon is incorrect. The bushings went on very easily and firmed up steering response compared to my old worn out rubber bushings. Can't beat Amazon prices, yet again- less than $21.00 delivered is a bargain!"
4,"Reminded me of ""They Live""","This movie reminded me of ""They Live"" from back in the day... lots of hidden messages about the mark of the beast, and reptilian aliens.."
2,Alie agenda,Not bad for a privatly made show. Some of the acting was good but alot sucked beyond belief. I would like to see some other shows by this guy.
1,Disappointing for a Wiley Publication,"I'll save you the cost of this book by summarizing its content:1. XBRL is a subset of XML that describes data using a pre-defined taxonomy of data identification tags established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ideal for reporting of financial data.2. XBRL (with an appropriate translator at each end) can act as a common data transport, aggregator or syndicator between any number of disparate financial systems and databases.3. Implementing XBRL might be tough because there are competing standards like EDI and ebXML for the transfer of financial reporting data with an installed base of hardware and software that companies might be reluctant to scrap.4. If XBRL is implemented on a large-enough scale, accountants can stop doing their current jobs and become consultants.<title>Essentials of XBRL</title><assessment>Disappointing for a Wiley publication</assessment>"
3,It's ok,When I purchased this book there really was not a large choice of books on XBRL. It's ok. Wouldn't read it just for fun.
4,Overview of an Important Language,"XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) is a language focused on facilitating the efficient, user-friendly and effective use and exchange of financial information.Based on the widely-utilized XML (eXtensible Markup Language) language, XBRL is an important language that offers a host of benefits to both producers and consumers of financial data and information.""Essentials of XBRL"" offers a comprehensive overview of XBRL, in terms of defining and contextualizing the language and in terms of providing an executive-level overview of the benefits of XBRL.This book is recommended reading for those interested in learning about XBRL. As XBRL is an evolving language, there are also a host of on-line resources and guides that should serve as good supplements to this book."
4,LOVE forever changes...,"Trust me. At 60 yrs. of age, 40 yrs. of marriage, and about 45 yrs. of fandom, I know.I don't want a new shiny bicycle every year for Christmas. I like my 1st bike very much!I'd like a Spanish guitar one year and maybe a trumpet the next. Or how about a dish that smells just like a fish?I guess the point is that I want to discover and be surprised! I want to be non-plussed at first... at least until I get to know my gift better. Then I can really enjoy it.And that's what all great artists have given to me. Thanks Arthur.Maudinally Yours,Rick"
1,"Great Album - but 4 of 5 ""bonus tracks"" are duplicates of album tracks","The core album contained on this CD is fantastic - I'm specifically reviewing the BGO import release, which touts 5 ""bonus tracks"" including previously unreleased/alternate versions of Everybody's Gotta Live, He Knows A Lot Of Good Women, He Said She Said, and You Want Change For Your Re-Run.This is simply not the case. I've studied this CD with great care. These bonus ""versions"" are LITERALLY the same exact waveforms as the ones in the normal track lineup - although a couple of them have a few seconds of dead space tacked on to the their ends to change the track-length a bit. 3:32 for the album version of Everybody's Gotta Live, 3:34 for the ""bonus"" version. The ONLY difference between these two tracks is 2 seconds of silence!This CD is great - but do NOT get it for the bonus tracks. BGO is flat out lying on the package, it is actually quite devious and certainly illegal. I'm returning this CD."
2,Bad performances from great comedians,"This is a really bad dvd. None of the comedians set the place alight at all. Tim Allen's performance is the pick of the bunch, even though it wasn't that good either. I found Chris Rock's material to be very weak for a guy that I consider to be the funniest comedian of all time. He has surely come a long way. Bill Hicks is his usual animated and unfunny self. This was a waste of time and money."
5,A twelve layer laugh riot!!!,"A must have to add to any comedy collection. This classic is a great asset to any comedy lover, and a good source of comedy in it best form: uncensored. Tim allen will make you cry with his ""men are pigs"" routine. 11 other comics will also make your sides hurt with thier unique brand of comedy."
2,Sandi what happened?,"Sandi is the best with the ""voice"" in the christian music industry but she failed to deliver with this project. I kinda get the message through the songs but there are only like 2 on here to me that I actually liked. I love the Sandi with the big vocals,background vocals,and big orchestrated arrangements. The powerhouse traditional Sandi was lacking from this album."
5,Worked well,"I used it to mount a 50 inch Phillips plasma panel - 130 lbs. Worked fine, but watch how you mount the brackets to the TV. I mounted them on the wrong holes on the first try, but this was fixed easily. Takes 3 people to get the TV on due to the weight, but the mount holds well."
2,"Not really for 32"" TVs","The product title says this is for 32-60"" TVs, but the description states it is for 37-60"" sets. In reality, the latter is correct because the mount is wider than the 32"" TV that I bought it for. So it sticks out on both sides of the TV. If you have a set smaller than 37"", I suggest purchasing the smaller model."
5,bang for the buck,"A good no frills wall mount for your flat screen. Good, heavy construction. Plenty of hardware and excellent directions for mounting. Finish was also good, no bare metal or unfinished surfaces. Only horizontal adjustability, but good enough for most applications."
4,Easy to install,"This is a great wall mount and easy to install. The only thing they should change about this mount is that they should add more holes toward the center of the wall plate. If there is a 2x4 just a couple of inches away from the center of where you want to mount your TV, you may have to drill a couple of additional holes in the wall plate as I had to do. Regardless of the small modification I had to make, I would still recommend this to anyone."
5,Solid Product,"With so many similar products, so many of which are so expensive, this is a solid product with a very competitive price. In addition, I suggest buying it through Amazon because of vendor reliability. You may save a few buck buying from a specialty online vendor, but it may not be worth the hassle."
5,"Simple, Straight-forward, and it Works","This is a mount for people who do not know how to hang a Flat Panel TV! I purchased for use with a 50"" Panasonic Plasma. I'm not certain how it would work for the 58"" or larger, but for most sizes it should go up easy. Just make certain that there are studs in your wall, and not an outside block wall."
5,Works Perfectly,Nice and sturdy and pretty straightforward instructions. They also include every bolt and piece of hardware that you could ever need. Only took about an hour to get the TV fully mounted.
5,PERFECT BETTER THAN PAYING 400$,THIS DOES THE WORK MUCH BETTER THAN ANY OTHER EXPENSIVE UNITS OUT THERE. JUST BUY THIS AND BE ASSURED THAT IT WILL HOLD YOUR VALUABLE UP IN THE AIR LOL....IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COOL IF IT COULD COME FORWARD AND BACK. BUT IT DOES TILT A BIT.
5,Flat Screen Wall Mount,Wall mount works perfectly and fits the new flat screen with the all the proper hardware. I think it's better than the ones that have a tilt function. Review the dimensions carefully with the product description. I bought the wrong sized mount the first time. But it worked great the second time.
2,Didn't fit the holes for the 60-inch Pioneer plasma,"Not a bad looking wall mount, but it just plain doesn't fit all plasmas that it says it does. It won't fit the Pioneer 60-inch PDP-6070, or the PDP-6071, or the PDP-CMX type displays. The mounting holes on the back of these plasmas require one from Omni Mount. Be careful!"
2,"Works, but....","Works ok, but access to bolts used to secure tv to mount are very difficult to access."
5,Easy to install and mount...,"I installed this and mounted a 50"" Plasma TV in under 30 minutes... it holds very well..."
4,Great!,"This was very easy to assemble. The most time consuming part was getting all the wires into the wall and connected to the TV properly. The mount itself was very easy to put together and put on the wall. And the TV does sit as flush to the wall as you can get. Our tv is a 42"" LCD and fits great on the mount."
2,Not that smooth.,"I bought this cd on after listening the samples above, wich I think was a mistake. Yes, the 3 first tracks are great, but the rest of the cd is quite boring with tracks that dont get my feet tapping. Not the Om-quality I expected."
3,"Great tunes, shame about the DJ","I have stacks of OM cd's and was looking forward to hearing some material that I may have missed on this label. And to that extent I was not disappointed, but that said the mixing on this album is absolutely appauling, DJ Fluid hang your head in shame. He obviously doesn't understand the music he's working with, trying to fit square pegs into round holes, some of the clashing of records is frankly embarrasing !, nothing short of bedroom mixing. But if you can ignore the mix, some of the tracks are the usual sublime OM material, still worth a listen."
1,I'll never know if the bulbs work well...,"I never saw whether this bulb worked. The first one arrived shattered. Cross-ship return. The second one arrived shattered. Cross-ship return. The third one didn't have any glass obviously broken, but the packaging was the same and the bulb never flickered or lit. Returned.At the end of the day, Petco actually had better pricing for an equivalent bulb and shipped in MUCH BETTER packaging. So...try the bulb, but be ready to return it if you hear glass rattling when it arrives."
5,AN ALL AROUND FEEL -GOOD SONG!!!!,I LIKE THIS SONG IT IS A GOOD FEEL GOOD SONG THAT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD ALL OVER. YOU KNOW THAT SEEING IS BELIEVING DON'T SAY YOU LOVE ME IF YOUR'E LEAVING
3,strap tightening problem with the liner,The adjustment strap keeps coming loose and you have to take it apart to tighten it up. The liner strap should have had the turn adjustment.
4,Ohio State Hard Hat,The Ohio State Hard Hat is just what I was looking for. The hard hat meets all safety standards and fits well. I have standard webbing in this hard hat which works well but the rachet style was suppose to have come with it. This is the only reason for four star rating is because of attention to detail by the seller.
1,Bike no-go,On assembling this product I was faced with the fact that the seat could not fit unto the bike as the shaft to attach it was too small and thus the screw could not be tightened. Further the gear assembly was broken and thus I am stuck with a bike without a seat and unworkable gears. I will have to spend other sums of money to get it workable. Amazon's quality control in the products it sells comes into question.
5,The book for Wing Chung dummy kata!,"This book contains Master Yip Man's complete 116 move wooden dummy kata. Each of the moves is shown with an excellent picture and clear instructions. This is probably the best way to improve one's infighting techniques. The book is written by the master's son, Master Yip Chun using photographs that his father had originally had taken to leave for his students. An essential book for kung fu students."
4,Great basics for in-house urinalysis,"This book is a must have for the clinician and techinician doing frequent in house UA's. There are good illustrations and explanations of the most common pathology found in daily samples. However, there is NOT a good layout of ALL of the basic crystals found in urine sediments, but most of the common crystals are featured. Case studies found near the end of the book really come in handy for interpreting samples as related to patients."
2,Did not meet expectations.,i brought this book to study for a Graduate course and it really felt short of text on the partial differential equations section. Its a alright book for the bachelors course though.
2,too expensive,"I bought it and than I found one with little lcd 512 for the same price, so I recomend you serch for better price."
4,Glad I could still find this product.,"Amazon.com marketplace was the only place where I could still find this product in the color ""butter"", which is what I purchased 5 of several years ago for my new Bed and Breakfast. I wanted to buy five more as spares, and was glad I could still find this. Very happy with this product -- softness, coziness. Only drawback is the blanket gets extremely heavy when being laundered and is likely to unbalance your washing machine."
1,Very disappointed,"I ordered the Amber color expecting it to be a light-ish yellow but what I received was just plain old off white. Why it's called Amber I'll never understand. Whoever chose that name cost me quite a bit in shipping considering I had to pay to have it shipped to me and pay to ship it back to the company I bought it from.I'm really getting a bit angry because I have ordered several blankets this year and have had to send them all back. I never have problems with other items, only blankets. And it's all been due to colors! And before someone comments, yes, my monitor is calibrated properly. I work with color for a living and would have no money to buy blankets on Amazon if my monitor showed incorrect colors!I will say that the company I purchased it from was very polite and stated that they will accept my return without a problem. That's the only positive part of this expensive mess."
3,"Book itself came as advertised, but the content of the book left a bit to be desired","This book, in my understanding, was one of the first and most important attempts at putting down on paper a cohesive black liberation theology. Cone is clearly well-educated and well-read, however his logic and basis of authority leave a lot to be desired. He tends to begin his remarks in each section with a well-researched history and discussion of the given theological topic, but then makes rather abrupt jumps to his clear agenda of black liberation which, in many cases, are not supported by scriptural or historical sources, or are even logical given his reasoning. Basically, he tends to make bold and sweeping assertions without adequately or logically supporting them."
3,Orgins of Black Theology,"Worked with this book for a group presentation on Black Liberation Theology, and it is the standard for this genre of theology. Cone was tired of theology only being looked at from an Anglo perspective. This theology tied in well with the Black Power movement of the 1960s, an offshoot of the Civil Rights movement that was tired of turning the other cheek to white oppression. This book clearly outlines how to look at the bible from the perspective of someone who has been in bondage for 400 years. While I do not hold to this view of theology, it did help me understand this viewpoint much better than before. BJoseph Dworak"
4,Cone in the late 60's,This book offers a wonderful insight in Black Liberation Theology and James Cone's heart and mind in the late 60's.
3,ok but not clear about the edition,I expected the newer addition and recieved a very old one. Seller should be more clear about which one they are trying to sell.
5,The best historical fiction I've ever read!,"James Carroll's sweeping novel tells the life story of Colman Brady, taking us from his wedding day in 1920s Ireland and his participation with Michael Collins in the Irish Rebellion, to his move to America and his position as right-hand man to James Michael Curley in Boston. The characters are so well drawn that the reader cares about them and becomes absorbed in their lives, not even realizing that he or she is learning history in the process. We see the inner workings of Boston's local politics, the intrigues of the members of the Boston Mafia, and the powerful Kennedy political machine, all through the eyes of Colman Brady. The narrative is complex but so well written that the reader is never bored for an instant. James Carroll is a masterful writer. I read voraciously, and I've rarely been this impressed by an author. I'll be looking for more of his works. Please do yourself a favor and read this book. You'll be very glad you did."
5,excellent first novel,This is an excellent first novel from Mr. Preston. He tells the story of January Calhoun and how circumstances in life can cause an intelligent young man to make the wrong decisions for his life. I enjoyed the characters and how we were able to see how they became the people they are. This is a good book for high schoolers to read. For adults it lets us know how important parents can be in guiding their children. My book club SILK (Sisters Increasing Literary Knowledge) really enjoyed this book and are looking forward to a movie based on it and a hopefully a sequel later.
1,thoroughly disappointed.,"this only works adjusted all the way down. the screws provided don't have enough range to hold the legs, so they pop up anytime they are extended."
2,"Spend the money, get a Harris","I purchased this bipod to mount on a 308 set up for long range shooting. It looks like a Harris but doesn't perform as one. For the money it's fine, but the legs are too easily bent and it doesn't feel secure. I just think my other bipods made by Harris are better quality and more secure."
4,Good for the price,This item was just as described. It is not fancy but it works. The legs work best fully extended or fully collapsed.
5,Very Good Bi-Pod - Highly Recommended,"This Shooters Ridge Bi-Pod attached easily to the sling stud on our .308 and easily handles the recoil. Here are my observations:+ Good Quality; feels sturdy+ Easy Installation; clever connector allows for easy on/off+ Adjustable; leg height can be adjusted independently to accommodate uneven surface+ Sling Stud; allows the sling to be attached to the bi-pod+ Folding; legs fold forward when not in useThis was also fairly inexpensive, making it a good value.Highly Recommended!CFH"
4,Good Bi-Pod for the price,I have it mounted on a heavy barrel varmint gun and it works just as well as the more expensive bi-pods I own.
4,good on my 22,what can i say its a bipod. it holds the gun up and does what its supposed to even after being dropped a few times. would b uy again for another rifle
5,Great Bi-Pod,"I used this on my DPMS LR-308 with no problems, bought another for my savage hunter 223 with no problems and bought several for other friends and they all liked the bi-pod.... especially when Gander wants atleast double the cost for it on here."
5,great for price,"great bi-pod for the price. is no harris, but cant beat it for the money. doesnt pivot, put together well. i have it a 300WM does great"
4,Good for the money,"Pros-Perfect for light to medium recoil calibers-Easy installation-Quality construction, everything was tight and how it was supposed to be-Has a swivel stud for a sling on bottom-Looks good AND feels goodCons-A little wiggle room when installed.......-This could be due to the shape of my forend though-Relatively thin metal used on legsFor those who say its difficult to install, it is very simple and straight forward. You simply unscrew the bolt until it is no longer pushing the metal piece upward and then insert the prongs into each side of the swivel stud. Then you tighten the bolt as tight as you can WITH YOUR HAND.My bipod did not come with any extra rail adapters or fittings.The small lock bolts on the legs are more than enough to maintain the desired height."
4,champion bipod,This bipod was easy to install and seems very sturdy. I have not had a chance to actually shoot the gun since I purchased tbe bipodroad but everythings seems to be of high quality and working as advertised.
4,Great product,"I bought this for a .22 rifle, and well worth it. There are the naysayers out there that will always find a way to be critical, but you have to put this in perspective, It's an inexpensive option for the casual shooter, it's not built for heavy duty use, your not gonna trek through the Yukon, or put to military use, there is equipment out there for that, this fits the bill for some light hunting and the shooting range. It's solid, it's stable, it's a good alternative if your on a budget."
5,Nice bipod,"This product was easy to mount and really helped my shooting. It is an inexpensive piece of equipment, but it seems to be well made. So far I am very happy with the purchase."
4,Good Bipod for the average shooter,"I bought this bipod last Christmas for my Weatherby Vanguard. It works great, I love it. Very stable and very solid support."
5,Great for the money,"good little bipod will fit on stocks with built in sling studs, do not get your fingers in between the rubber feet"
5,Beautifully written New Testament allegory,"The first time I read this book I wasn't aware it was a Christian allegory. I was enthralled by the beautiful language and verse-like presentation.As a musician I knew how music could evoke emotions. But until I read this series of three books I never knew it could be presented in text and still have the same effect.It's musical telling of the Gospels, Acts and Revelations really brought home and helped me visualise events in a way nothing had ever done before.A must read for anyone looking to refresh their view of the New Testament, or simply to hear one of the most beautifully told tales in print."
4,The Singer Trilogy,"I thought I did a review for this last week but it didn't appear to have gone through. This is a great book and anything Calvin Miller writes is worth the time and expense. I had read ""The Singer"" before, so when I saw the trilogy was available in one volume, I knew I had to buy it. I can't imagine anyone would be disappointed. It's really a must have!"
1,Never worked for us.,"We consistently get temperatures like 87 degrees, 92 degrees, etc.Contacted manufacturer, who sent replacement. Same result. :-("
2,Not acurate,I am sorry to say I had to return this item as it wasn't acurate. While recovering from knee surgery it was important to have an acurate thermometer and I found this one to be as much as two degrees off from the one my PT was using. I did like the size and case.
4,Great stuff at the start,"The first half of the book was packed with great techniques, of which my favorite has to be the color to black and white technique, that has opened my eyes to a whole new world :)The 2nd part is more of a case-study type exercise where you go from a normal guy's face to a monster's face... its good fun, but sometimes I feel like the techniques used aren't the best ways to achieve a certain effect... for example in the video you see the artist constantly go to the menu bar to perform commands rather than explain or use short-cuts instead. I felt that some parts were a bit boring in the 2nd half.However, the first half of the book is well worth it already, so I give it 4 stars overall :)"
1,"All HYPE, No Substance","I don't know who's ghost-writing his material (perhaps Julieanne Kost), but the guy can't make any of the stuff that he's allegedly so brilliant about in his writings work in person. He's just a self-absorbed, not so entertaining ""personality"" who has an ""Adobe Credit Card"" (& big budget to support it) who can buy himself expensive toys to play with. Try meeting and dealing with him in person sometime! When he's 1:1 you see the smoke behind the mirrors. And there are no 'layers' to that smoke. Very unidimensional. Skip Brown. Look to Chris Orwig, Katrin Eisman, Julieanne, Jan Kabili, and others for real skill, insight and decent personalities. Who needs to read stuff ghost-written by others that appears under Brown's moniker."
4,Better to pick them up at the store,"I had never had Mallomars before so I couldn't resist tasting them. These are definately delicious cookies. The cookie part is sort of like a chocolate chip cookie without the chips and then there is marshmallow and chocolate coating. Very good. But they are fairly fragile cookies. They fall apart a bit when you take a bite and since these were shipped to me, half were already falling apart before I could take any bites."
5,Great cookie!,"Marshmallow on a cookie base, covered in chocolate. Whoever thought up Mallomars came up with a real winner! How can you go wrong with that combination, plus the expertise of Nabisco making them? The answer to that obvious question is ; you can't! One of the best treats around, hands down! Very well packaged too. They were very fresh, something that is vital to any treat in general but especially one with marshmallow. Stale marshmallow is NOT good! The only problem I had with these is that I could not leave them alone...until they were gone!"
2,Too sweet for me,"These Mallomars pack a lot of sugar. They do have a chocolate taste. But the marshmallow taste overwhelms the more subtle chocolate, so that I felt at first like I was spooning sugar into my mouth and chewing it. Needless to say, that is not a good taste for me.Before the box was gone, I got more used to the sugar explosion, and the cookies tasted better. But that's not a good thing. Better to avoid this kind of treat. It's not good to like sugar."
2,Stale old Mallomars,"I love mallomars, and after moving to the west coast from NYC attempting to find them was disappointing, so I was so excited when I saw them on Amazon. Unfortunately the ones I got were old and stale (the chocolate had that white film on it) so I was super disappointed.I found them at a few local stores around here so that makes me happy, but I don't think I'll be buying groceries off Amazon again any time soon. :C"
1,Cookie on the bottom tastes horrible.,"My 7 year old took one bite of this product and then pushed the rest of the box to me and said I could have it. I was greatly surprised by this because chocolate and marshmellows are her 2 of her favorite ingredients. After taking a bite of the product myself, I understood her distaste of the product. Package-wise, the box didn't appear to be crushed at all and arrived looking like new. However, a majority of the cookies had separated somewhat to the cookie part. This product is a take on the Smores concept, however, it lacks the taste of a smores. The marshmallow is light and sweet, similar to frosting almost. The chocolate is ok, but it's only a very thin covering over each cookie. By far the worst issue w/ this cookie is the cookie portion. It tastes horrible, looks and tastes like sawdust.I would never purchase this product and would not recommend it."
2,Disappointing.,"My Mallomars looked like they were either very old and past their shelf life or (more likely) had been stored in a facility that was too hot or too cold for the cookies. The chocolate looks ashy and is cracked and the cookies taste a little stale. I'll be asking for a refund. Such a bummer, I love these cookies."
3,Mmmmmm........mmmmm,I decided to try these since I remember eating them as a kid (decades ago) and they are still quite tasty. Mallomars are a combination of crisp cookie bottom with marshmallow on top covered by a chocolate coating. My 11 yr old son and 13 yr old daughter are looking forward to eating more this evening. We tried them both with and without milk; decided they are better without milk.The only negative (and it may be because these were mailed to me as single box in an envelope) is that many of the cookie bottoms had separated from the marshmallow top

2,"Great stuff, but get it locally.","I know how Mallowmars taste. They are the truly splendid fall treat I have looked forward to around thanksgiving for as long as I can remember. So what I really was checking via this order was how well they ship.The answer is, terrible. The over long, Two weeks of delivery time turned the cookie part to crumbs on almost every one. The chocolate was melted to the plastic tray on half of them (only half?). Overall a fail, and certainly not something you would want to open up in front of guests.Get them locally or find a replacement. Splurge on faster shipping perhaps? I can not vouch for that option having not tried it though. As is, the standard shipping makes for sad mallomars pandas.The second star is for the two in the box that had part of a cookie left and were somewhat edible."
4,They don't travel well.,"The last time I bought Mallomars was in a local grocery store, and they were old. These from Amazon were fresh (sell-by date is 3 months in the future) and they taste nice and fresh with nice soft marshmallow. However, even though the box shows no sign of damage, some of the cookies inside had broken apart and every one of them was covered in cookie crumbs. This doesn't really affect the eatability of them, but it is disappointing. I just don't think Nabisco has put enough thought into the packaging for Mallomars."
5,Delicious,"You might think a boxed cookie from a major manufacturer is guaranteed to be bad (I did), but these things are really quite good. The chocolate actually tastes like chocolate (and pretty good chocolate at that), the marshmallow is soft, and the cookie is crunchy. So good in fact that I only got half of one cookie. I split one with my son when we first opened the box. When I asked a few days later where the box had gone, well, I got some sheepish looks.Ingredients are fairly natural. There's some high fructose corn syrup, but they're otherwise real components.My box arrived fairly squished, so you might be taking some chances with the shipping gods, but that's not the fault of the cookies so I'm not changing my rating based on that."
3,cookies melt together easily,"I was surprisingly excited about receiving these the other day, but I was disappointed with the actual product. The cookies melted easily and began to stick to one another. After prying them apart, they crumbled. The taste was ok, but not stellar. If you are in the mood for s'mores, this might hit the spot, but they are not the best cookie I have had. I would only buy them if they were on sale."
2,Bad Day At the Factory?,"I have to say I was disappointed with this sample. The cookies were not a pleasing dark chocolate color as one might expect. The chocolate coating was a pale washed out brown color as if they had been subjected to extremes of temperature. The cookie part of the Mallomars was very dry and had started crumbling before I even opened the cellophane package. I do not know if this is typical of other samples sent out but this was certainly neither appealing nor appetizing. The outer packaging arrived in good shape so I do not think the problem was with the mailing. These were not the Mallomars I recalled enjoying from my youth. Based on this sampling, I certainly could not recommend these cookies."
2,What a disappointment!,"These cookies were a childhood favorite, so I really looked forward to receiving them. But the cookies I received had obviously been stored improperly (maybe frozen at some time?) The chocolate had a dusty bloom, and the tops separated from the graham cracker base at the slightest touch. They are not bad tasting, but certainly didn't live up to expectations!"
3,Stale,"I haven't ever had any actual Mallomars, so I thought I'd give them a try since there was nothing else good in the newsletter. I like chocolate and marshmallow and cookies, so this should have been good. They might be if you buy them from a real store. The box I got though tasted stale. The chocolate had that white stuff on it and the cookies were kind of dried out. Some were broken from the shipping too. So my advice would be if you want some Mallomars to get them fresh from the store and don't buy them off a website."
4,"Sweet, campy bites of cookie, marshmallow, and chocolate","I had heard about the Mallomars long before reviewing this product. They are part of food lore along the lines of the girl scout cookie and smores. Stripped of its reputation, this is a simple graham cracker, with a generously portioned marshmallow, all coated in a chocolate shell. It is a mass-produced, room temperature derivative of the smoore. While not crazy about the taste relative to premium cookies, it is satisfying as a snack on its own. And immediately after telling my wife that I expected something else, I found myself grabbing inside the package for seconds and thirds. Is the chocolate going to be mistaken for Godiva? No. Does this make me forget campfire smores from days past? No. But as my wife remarked, if Nabisco's Mallomar was priced at two for $5 in a supermarket, I'd take both and count myself lucky for it."
5,Make me feel like a kid again,"I loved Mallomars when I was young, but haven't had them for years. Now I remember why. I don't just eat one, I eat the ENTIRE BOX. They are as good as I remember; sweet cookie, dark chocolate and soft, fluffy marshmallow. Wonderful!!!"
3,Nothing to stand out at all,"I admit that while the structure of this cookie seems familiar, I'm not particularly acquainted with ""Mallomars"". Now, to start with, I'm a cookie lover, a marshmallow lover, and a chocolate lover. This has all three -- they are practically s'mores with cookies instead of graham crackers. But eating them I can't help but feel like they are just really in 'average' department. The mallow part is somewhat tough, and there's only a thin layer of chocolate. I like the cookie part, but it's not enough to give the whole thing a higher rating -- especially as it's pretty expensive (over $5 for an 8 oz box) and though it's a small nitpick, it's hard to recommend anything, especially something meant as a snack and already high in calories, with high fructose corn syrup in it.Maybe if they were a bit healthier and tasted a bit less....processed....I'd give it higher marks. But not with all the factors in play."
1,...product arrived in a condition that was not acceptable,This product arrived in a condition that was not acceptable. The chocolate was discolored and the cookies were broken apart. They look so unappetizing that I did not want to eat them and therefore didn't. I wondered if they were stored in a warehouse that was not climate controlled.
5,Mallomars Deserve 10 Stars,"I am a fan of fresh baked goods and tend to eschew the traditional brand-name cookies. If my husband buys Chips Ahoy, for example, he is safe from having me share them.There are exceptions to my rule. Vienna Fingers, Milanos...I will allow them into my kitchen and my tummy.But none of them remotely compare to the cookie I actually crave: the not-remotely-humble Mallomar.The delicious, thin dark chocolate cover is in complete harmony with the amount of marshmallow and graham cracker cookie bottom. The balance is exquisite. This cookie is every bit as special as any baked good. More, in many cases.If you have never treated yourself to the joy that is a Mallomar, go get yourself a box and revel in its perfection. You can only buy them during fall and winter, so get them while you can."
4,As good as ever for fans of Some-Mores,"Yes these are my favorites from years ago as a kid in New York City. Originally made by Nabisco according to the history on the box, enjoyed for 90 tears, now made by Kraft foods. These are a graham cracker like cookie, topped with marshmallow and covered in a chocolate crust. A real treat and 2 cookies are 120 calories with 45 from fat. So if you like Some-Mores, you will like these cookies. Only complaint is I hope that Amazon will take more care with the packaging. My box came with a few cookies broken."
1,Disappointed.,"Marshmallow, chocolate, cookie...put it all together and its a visit to my grannys house as a child. Where she would break out the Mallomars (her favorite) and let us grandkids demolish them in seconds. I would always eat the cookie part first than the squishy marshmallow chocolate hat.So we were looking forward to this box arriving from Amazon, we hadnt had these in years.The anticipation was thick, were they going to be as good as we remembered? would they still smell so sweet and chocolatey? Rustle, Rip, Tear...and .....sad face.All the cookies had seperated from the tops, the chocolate coating the cookies and marshmallows had cracked and separated, turning an ashy brown color. I picked up a cookie and bit into it...stale. I picked up a mallow top hat and the chocolate fell into my lap. The expiration date wasnt past, and they were packaged ok, so I dont understand what went wrong.They were just nasty, and broken and disappointing....more sad face."
2,Not at all impressed,"These cookies were falling apart when I opened the package and they were also oddly discolored. My spouse and I went ahead and each ate one. Well, he ate one. I took one bite and rejected it. The chocolate is too thin and bitter for my taste. The cookie continued to fall apart after one bite. The one bite I had left an awful aftertaste in my mouth. My spouse wasn't impressed either. We will not be purchasing these."
2,Stale!,The product arrived stale & previously melted in places & stuck to the plastic inner packaging. Wouldn't order out of season from this vendor again. : ( Very disappointed.
4,awesome little cookies,"I've never actually had a mallowmar. When you first bite into them, nothing really overwhelms you and you're like, ""eh..."". But then the chocolate kind of asserts itself, then the marshmellow and it's ""Oh! These are really good!"" Also of note, my kids have never had them either and they LOVED them. I barely got to them to review them and the whole box was gone!"
4,The Original is Still The Best,"Pure Chocolate Mallowmars have been around for years and they are still fantastic. Rich, real chocolate, covering a fluffy marshmallow and a soft cookie. These are delicious and truly addictive. Mallowmars have just the right texture. My wife thinks they would be better without the cookie, but for me, the cookie is an integral part and I am perfectly happy with them. They are a great treat, but a bit expensive. Sometimes though, you just have to indulge yourself. What would life be without a little indulgence? Pretty dull."
5,Legendary,"Mallomars were a staple food in my family for decades. When I was young my father would hide them in a high cupboard and dole them out on an ""as needed"" basis. So this review is going to be a little biased but accurate.Mallomars are a round chocolate covered marshmallow topped kinda graham cracker cookie that is only available from October until the supplies run out. They are delicious without being sickeningly sweet or mushy. They can be enjoyed with milk, coffee, wine or any other beverage you like.They are often imitated, but they beat all challengers every time."
4,Smorelly goodness,"I'm a huge fan of Mallomars, one of the best snacks out there. The recent package I bought had the same issues others have mentioned, the chocolate was discolored and some had melted enough to stick to the packaging such that when you pulled them out the cookie base crumbled. However, the taste wasn't off at all and it was all going to the same place in the end anyway."
1,arrived in bad condition,"It's difficult to fairly evaluate when the product arrives in bad condition. The celophane bag seemed intact, but the cookies inside were crushed. The chocolate coating was discolored and the cookies were broken and tasted stale."
3,"Yummy ,tasty treat","I've seen Mallomars on the shelves for years but never felt that urge to purchase them. But I was finally able to give them a try and I was glad I did.When I bit into my first Mallomar, it took me a minute to get used to the texture and the taste. It's chocolate covered marshallow on a graham cracker. I expected there to be some crunch from the cracker but the entire cookie is soft. The chocolate crumbles a little when you bite into it. After eating two more, I decided that I liked them. And that I needed to put the box away fast or I was going to consume them in one sitting.Mallomar is a nice alternative to s'mores. It's neater and you don't burn your mouth because the marshallow is too hot. So now I finally know what the hype is all about.3/5"
2,Caution: High Fructose Corn Syrup,"I have no idea why an established product such as this would want to send out samples to vine members to review. That said, the box I got suffered from the lack of sturdy packaging and about half of the cookies were broken and they all had a whitish tinge to the chocolate part that made me think they had been around too long.I am always careful to read labels because I am intolerant of High Fructose Corn Syrup and when I find it on the label as I did in this product I cannot eat it. I assume that the HFCS is in the marshmallows because all marshmallow products seem to contain it these days. It amuses me when a product advertises that it has been on the market for over 75 years and yet contains HFCS because this means it is not the original formula by any standards.My 6 year old grandson would not eat these, but my husband ate them so they did not go to waste."
5,His eye is on the sparrow,"Extremely good book. Read it in small paperback about 30 years ago, and I was pleased to see that is still regarded as marketablr enough to have been rewritten in this high quality paperback. Delivery from Amazon was expedient and the price is certainly good,"
3,His Eye Is On The Sparrow,"Whew, what an upbringing, what a life. Waters goes into great detail about her rearing in the slums of Philadelphia, her life as vaudevillian Sweet Mama Stringbean and finally the Ethel Waters of stage, screen, and records. I didn't really know much about Miss Waters other than her role in the movie Pinky, so this book provided great insight into her life. Pretty good. The conversational tone makes it easy to read."
5,Very moving and inspirational,I read this book when I was in my 20's and just read it again recently. I have a lot of respect for this wonderful woman who was able to overcome so many obstacles to reach her goals.
3,Great Book,Great book about Ethel Waters and her life. I have always loved her in movies.Would recommend it to anyone.
4,Our Uncles Way Of Life,"A marvelous depiction of Boston Irish blue collar life from the beginning of the century to the present. It speaks of the culture of the Great War, Prohibition, the Depression, and, most prominently, the famous Sacco and Venzetti trial and executions. It's a great and moving read with the wit and eleoquence of the Irish. It accurately informs of the lives and ways of the Boston Irish who were born around 1900."
4,Good for learning opposites in Spanish,"This is a straight-forward vocabulary book of opposite words (big/little, noisy/quiet) in English and Spanish. The Spanish words are accompanied by phonetic pronunciations in English. Male and female conjugations are provided for the Spanish adjectives. The whimsical bear drawings on each page do a good job of illustrating the concepts being taught."
1,Women doing a disservice to other women.,"If ever a woman should not be a mother, then Faulkner Fox is it. She is so busy keeping track of which parent is doing more in the house and with the children that she barely even mentions enjoying her children. Not only did she appear to be keenly depressed, she seemed angry at the world. Rather than focusing on what actually made her happy, she was obsessed with why she couldn't keep a clean house, make friends, what her husband's colleagues thought of her, etc. Talk about needy, this woman is someone so in need of confidence that I feel her children will spend millions in therapy. This book is wrongly recommended to pregnant and working moms."
1,Thought about sending back to the author,"I was expecting self-effacing humor from someone trying to do it all. Not this book. Egocentric and self-centered are much more the words that come to mind. The only one putting down Motherhood is Faulkner Fox who would rather be working, because apparently mothering isn't important enough for a white liberal woman. I tried to have sympathy with the woman but couldn't. Don't like Gymboree's? Don't go. Personally, I don't have that kind of conflict and I don't understand it in others, especially when they are hypocritical about it. Marriage for Faulkner is a competition about who gets to work and who ""has"" to raise the kids and clean the house (a low priority from the sounds of it), not a mutual striving together, each person doing what they can to get the whole family ahead.In short, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, except perhaps as a study in dysfunctionality."
1,"Erma Bombeck, Where Are You?","This book is the sort of pretentious tripe that will be reviewed seven-ways-to-Sunday by NPR, The New York Times, The Today Show, and other ""cool"" media outlets that ""cool"" well-educated people consume. For the rest of us, that is, those who aren't Harvard-educated ""feminists,"" we just don't get it, dahling. But the joke, ultimately, is on the haughty know-it-alls. Middle-American, frowsy, dumpy writers like the late Erma Bombeck are the ones who laugh all the way to the bank because they know what the mass audience wants to read, and it ain't this, sistah! Ms. Fox will get her buzz, but the buyers at Costco and Sam's won't bite."
1,Motherhood doesn't have to be this way!,"I'd give Faulkner Fox's book 2 stars as an honest account of one cynical, depressed woman's struggle to deal with motherhood. However, this book is being marketed as a book that ""every pregnant or planning-to-be-pregnant woman with a modicum of ambition would do well to read,"" and as such I'd give it ZERO stars. Fox is full of anger and resentment, and she had such unrealistic expectations of motherhood that it's no wonder she was disappointed. Her story is painful to read. She was depressed before, during, and after the arrival of her husband and children. As Fox herself said in her analysis of Sylvia Plath: ""Motherhood hadn't cured her. Perhaps it exacerbated what ailed her. It certianly hadn't make her into something other than what she was before."" Don't belive the marketing hype--Fox's story does not represent every woman's experience, and I would NOT recommend this book for a new mother."
4,Do you need a master's degree to be a Mom?,"This is a must read for any mother who worked diligently to educate herself and have a career, but gave it all up to be home with her children. Faulkner Fox describes her experiences as a new mom at home with one baby, and later a toddler and a baby, while her husband pursues his interests outside of the house. She tries to understand what her role is now and why, although she completely loves and adores her children, she still feels less than happy.Fox's writing is funny, honest, and sad. Stay-at-home-moms are lucky to be at home, but they also give up their own pursuits and interests. It is a heartbreaking dilemma because the children are only young for such a short period of time. Fox shares her personal experiences as a woman who has given birth to two children, works hard to engage and nurture them, but who also needs enriching experiences in her own adult life.Well-written and engaging."
1,Disappointing Waste of Time!,"As a college-educated woman in my 30's who has chosen to leave career and instead raise a child, I was looking forward to reading this book - to appreciating and supposedly LAUGHING at all the crazy, messy, mind-numbing, conflicting, frustrating, and loving situations I face every day. The author failed to convey that while there are many challenges associated with motherhood (and her own challenges seemed extremely trivial when compared to hardships and tragedies faced around the world!) - these challenges are TEMPORARY because children grow so fast. Instead of conveying something positive and encouraging, she ranted on and on aimlessly, coming across as insecure, ultra-neurotic, judgmental, and sometimes outright crazy. If this book did anything for me, it was to remind me not to have the ""I'm-so-angry"" outlook that Faulkner Fox so annoyingly expressed!"
1,Self centered drivel,"A boring read; about a completely dysfunctional woman... I couldn't finish it, she was so whiny. Please, the world needs less self centered reading material."
5,What Courage,"This is a wonderful book, smart and funny and honest. It takes a lot of courage to open up to the world about such personal matters, knowing that so many people are easily incited to vicious and thoughtless personal attacks.Many thanks to Faulkner Fox for sharing her life, angst and all. Thinking about motherhood doesn't make you a bad mother. Complaining about marriage doesn't make you a bad wife. Examining your world and voicing honest conflicts make you -- and, if you're a writer, your readers -- more healthy and fully realized individuals."
5,Refreshing Break from How-To-Be-A-Mom Books,"Faulkner Fox's book ""Dispatches"" is a hilarious and poignant and painstakingly truthful guide to juggling everything during the transition from working full-time to deciding to become a Mom----and then becoming one! It tells women how to hold onto themselves during the entire gruelling process. It's about work, love, our families, loving our families and the difficulties and cultural pressures that abound. It covers changes in our female friendships and our priorities, handling moving to new cities, lots of issues women grapple with. It give Moms validation and hope! Great book!"
5,"Thanks, Faulkner!","Faulkner,Thank you for your book and your honesty! I have mom-friends, but I have felt so lonely for the past 5 1/2 years because none of them are willing to talk about the truth. We're all sizing each other up and pretending everything is perfect at home. Now I know I'm not alone!I appreciate knowing that other bright women can love their children passionately but still be desperate for some outside mental stimulation alone.After reading this book, I feel like I have permission to be a mom my own way. I don't have to be in the super-mom competition with every other mommy we pass. If I can't stand Kindermusik, it's ok!I will look for anything else she writes in the future."
2,"Honest, but not helpful.","Fox definitely speaks some truths and I appreciate her honesty. However, I never really believed that she finally came to love the house, the man, or the child(ren).Also, if SHE is experiencing loss of self, imagine how mothers who work full-time, are the primary bread-winners, and then do 90% of the house and family work feel. That's what many, many of us do."
4,I enjoyed it,"As a married feminist on the verge of becoming a parent, I really appreciated this book's honest look at some of the inherent contradictions of the life I am attempting to live. I can't say I got a lot of answers from it, but I did feel a camaraderie with the author, like I wasn't alone in having the issues and concerns that I feel. I also found the book entertaining and laughed out loud at some parts.The book felt strangely organized. Each chapter could have stood on its own as an essay, but they didn't add up to much more than the sum of their parts. Still I'm really glad I read it and I recommended it to some friends.If you like this, you might also enjoy The Bitch in the House, in which about 20 women address the same issues from various stages of life and commitment."
5,"Funny, Sharp and Thought-Provoking","Faulkner Fox has truly hit a nerve, and I'm thrilled! Fox's voice is smart and funny, and her talent as a writer can't be missed.I loved reading about boycotting Gymboree and all the other Mommy-and-Me stuff that feels like such an obligation when you're a new mother. The concept of Frequent Parenting Miles cracked me up, and I too lament the days when I could talk for hours with friends about everything and nothing so I could figure out who I was and what I cared about.Like Fox, I love my husband and I love being a mom, but I also like to think. Dispatches from a Not-So-Perfect Life reminded me that the thinking part of me is still intact, and that I'm not the only conflicted, though usually happy, woman in the world. Bravo!"
2,Tepid and Poorly Written,"Unfortunately, the author comes across as though she were whining. There are real issues to explore here, however, her attempts to do so are unsuccessful. I also found her writing to be scattered. As a result, no momentum was built around any particular concern. The book came across as a bunch of minor complaints--from an extremely privileged woman. Other books in this genre that really hit the nail on the head include, Anne Lamott's Operating Instructions, and Mothers Who Think (an excellent collection of contemporary essays.) Also, the quarterly magazine, Brain Child, features consistently great writing on these issues."
2,This just couldn't keep my attention,"A couple of friends recommended this book to me, so I was really looking forward to reading it. I too have tried to balance writing, academia and parenthood, so I thought I would relate. But this book just couldn't keep my interest, and I admit that I only got about 2/3 of the way through before giving up. I don't mind motherhood memoirs that aren't all sunshine and flowers - in fact, I prefer ones that aren't - but this just seemed relentlessly dark without being compelling. Fox is a fine writer, but I don't know as though her talent is best suited to writing memoirs."
2,Live album fails to deliver,"While unquestionably a supremely gifted performer, Milton Nascimeto only occasionally hits the mark on this 1998 live album, eg the excellent opening track, a ""duet"" with the great, departed Elis Regina. Ultimately, Nascimento seems to substitute vocal tricks of technique and showmanship for the trademark passion and sincerity that moves us so deeply on classic works such as ""Club de Esquina 1 and 2"" (EMI, 1972 and 1978, resp.) and ""Miltons"" (Verve/A&M, 1989)."
2,Don't waste your money!,I used this thing for a long time. It worked fine for a little while. Soon some of the buttons stopped working properly. It became fairly inaccurate. The software was a mess! And it doesn't hold as much music as they claim. Get an iPod and the sport pack instead. You'll be glad you did!
2,Glorified radio.,"How confusing. That's all I will say about this gadget. I always thought I was good at figuring things out. I help my boyfriend with his phone and blackberry, I know my way around computers. Yet this gadget has only caused me grief. It was a gift from said boyfriend, and boy do I wish I could take it back! The good thing about it? Um....well...the radio? The one he bought for his daughter was much cheaper and MUCH easier to use. I have always been a firm believer in ""you get what you pay for"" and I never try to cheat myself when it comes to technology. But I think this time, I may go for cheaper. None of the MP3s I have on my computer will work but it works on hers, so I don't believe it to be a file problem. Only buy this product if a person asks for it specifically or you want it yourself for the fancy running feature."
1,Shady performance. Horrible customer service. Over-priced. Was a waste of money...,"I bought this in Dec of '04 as I run a lot and thought it would be cool to track distance / pace / time. The sensor fell off my shoe as I was running only three weeks after I bought it. The mounting braket is in new condition and has not loosened up. It is a bad design.I called Nike to get a replacement (after all, I barely used it 10 times!). They told me they do not sell the sensor as a spare part. They gave me an RMA number and asked that I send it back to their warranty / repair center to get a replacement. They sent the box back to me as is without even putting a note on it.Another note is that the sound volume on it is too low (I had other models before which were fine).My recommendation: Go buy a real MP3 player. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Hear no evil.,"This isn't something you can't get on the original LP ""Wu-tang Forever"". No use buying this if you got the original LP."
4,There was life before Mulder and Scully!,"Two years before Catatonia exploded in popularity, this debut album was released. The style is similar to their next two albums, if a little more intricate here. It doesn't show the all-round quality of 'International Velvet' (and Cerys somehow doesn't sound quite as Welsh here as she's sounded on their recent stuff!) but this CD does have some gems.'You've got a lot to answer for', 'Sweet catatonia' and 'Way beyond blue' are the highlights of early Catatonia. 'You've got a lot...' is the best, as we witness Cerys at her most humorous as she sings us through the scenario of a possible pregnancy: 'My DNA'll be past it's sell-by date...'. Sweet - check this album out."
3,There Has to Be Better Than This,"After watching Catatonia perform ""Bleed"" on Jools Holland's Cool Brittania DVD I purchased ""Way Beyond Blue"". Unfortunately ""Bleed"" is heads and shoulders above the other tracks, most of which are forgettable. Cerys' vocals are double-tracked to an annoying extreme and the melodies are dreary. To my fellow Americans who have never heard of Catatonia here's the best way to describe them: rank order Blur's songs, take the bottom third, and replace Damon with Cerys. That about sums it up."
2,"Good in a pinch, but better guides are out there","We live in the mountains in North Central New Mexico. We put up a backyard birdfeeder, and for the first time in my life I've tried to identify all of our seasonal visitors. Many of the birds that we most frequently see - specifically juncos, finches and woodpeckers - are much different looking than the pictures in this book. I have found the Peterson Field Guide of Western Birds to far more accurately depict the birds we see, especially when it comes to identifying different subspecies for our area."
4,Birds by Color,"If you wonder what that bird is, this is the book to find out. All the birds are in there by their color. We are new to New Mexico and this book sure makes it easy to identify any bird."
1,Not elastic waist... Draw string not helpful,These pants are very uncomfortable for use of any sort. Waist isn't elastic. Difficult to tie draw string so that pants stays up on waist. Would never order these again or recommend. Very difficult and uncomfortable to use.
5,Saved my financial life,"I read this book right before going through the consolidation process. I have a student loan over the $100,000 mark. This book was unbelievably helpful - easy to read, clear, humorous, and hopeful. It allowed me to take control of the process and make an educated decision about repayment. I read it through in about 2 days, then re-read it several times. After I read it, I emailed it to all of my friends in graduate school (and recently graduated). It's helped all of us. It was the only thing out there that broke it down and explained it all to me while also offering practical advice. It was the only one that addressed the emotional issues around student loans as well - at least someone else out there knew how it felt! It's a great book and I highly recommend it."
3,Read this book BEFORE you take out student loans,"This book really will not help you if you already have student loan debt. If you do, the advice is simple - hunker down and pay it off. If you have no student loan debt, read this book and reconsider your desire to go into debt for your education. You can get a good education on the ""pay as you go"" method if you do it right. Take it from someone who made all the wrong choices - don't go into debt for your education!! I don't recommend this book if you already have sutdent loan debt - focus on paying it off. Save the money you'd spend on this book and put it toward your loan payoff."
2,Outdated,This purchase was very inexpensive so I had no problem. It is outdated and I wished I shopped a little longer and found a better book.
4,About as Good as a Student Loan Book Could Get,This book is just fine. I guess the bottom line is you need to make the money to pay the damn things off however. I'd like to see something in a more loompanics sort vein.
4,"5-Star Start, 3-Star Ending","Will Staeger's debut novel sets off as if it's going to be one of those rare fast-paced intelligent thrillers with non-stereotypical characters in non-stereotypical situations. The first 300 pages of the book are dead-on target as the characters are introduced, situations set up, and motivations and histories established. The details and events up to this point were top-notch, and all the characters richly developed.Unfortunately, as the book finally found its way to the conclusion, Staeger's story didn't pick up the pace like a thriller should, and remained a richly-deep piece of work with stellar writing. I spent the last 75 pages skimming along to get to the action and resolution of the plot. Staeger is a good writer, but the book's pacing definitely lagged when it should have been getting quicker.Worth a read."
3,Ouch!,"These were fine after the 6 months of intense pain in took to break them in. And I use them A LOT. Sturdy, Durable, Fashionable, and PAINFUL!"
4,Seems to work,Looked like the original. Great price would buy from again. Will be looking for colored cartriages soon. I Would recomend.
3,Destroys the Meaning!,"I have to start out by saying that I am not impressed. Basically, a lot of this book just repeates stuff that the game already tells you. Other than that, it tells you specifically what Pokemon to use! The whole point of being a ""Pokemon trainer"" is to assemble teams that suit you, not the game! If all you care about is beating the game, then this is very helpful (which is why I rated it three stars). But if you enjoy trying out different teams or beating the game with your just your favorite Pokemon, then this is not for you."
1,disappointed,"I thought this was a poster, it's not its a blurred, mutted, colored picture on a 8 x 10 piece of paper. The picture doesn't even cover the whole sheet. It's like a picture taken of a poster."
3,read it for what it is,"I wish I had known this was a book for children before my purchase,as I was under the impression the book was about the making of the series""Sea Hunt""."
2,Ambitious adolescence,"2 1/2I can't fault early Cave-In for attempting to break the mold of hardcore music from such an early start, I just understand why they eventually leaned 180 degrees away towards more melodic rock in the future. Despite a heavy dose of unorthodox pummeling with occasional creative flourishes, the album just does not work as well as it should. Heavy on fragmented ideas but light on convincing wholes and boring with generic screaming vocals, Until Your Heart Stops is still a revelation when put in its neo-Slayer context- that award simply does not have much merit to me."
1,Boring!,"This toy has little to no educational value and made little to no impact on my child. She got it as a gift and played with it for one day and then she was bored with it. It's like paper dolls, but with magnets instead. Save your money."
1,Useless Toy,Do not waste your money on this garbage. The recordings are completely inaudible. This thing is fresh off the rack from the 99 cent store.
4,PSYCHEDELIC-BLUES ROCK,"Out of all my Tommy Boin CDs, this is the most unusal for me. Not being a big fan of Bolin with Zephyr to begin with, this didn't win me over to say the least. It does deserve 4 stars though, because there are about 2 or 3 incredible if not to say, how does Tommy do it guitar solos. Most notably on Hard Chargin' Woman, which is his best I ever heard. Other the music is just unrehearsed, unpolished, and a bit unfocused. But I didn't expect this to be a tight, live set because the band had been broken uo for well over a year before getting back to together for this show. So it's just one big jam fest. A negative is Candy Givens, I never liked her singing so that's a real bummer on this but the music more than makes up for it. For Bolin fans, again, this is a must, because Tommy's solos on here are some of the best ever! LONG LIVE TOMMY BOLIN!"
5,Good Quality,Used it on my motorcycle & it looks great. People think it is a professional job from the factory. The molding cuts & shapes easily. I bent it sideways at 60 degree angles around the gas tank & the adhesive stuck like it was nailed on. The bike sits in the hot sun all day & the molding has never loosened or peeled. I would definitely buy it again.
1,didnt use it,i really didn't try it because it is not compatible with my Mac OS Xnot like what they mention on the Box 'Compatible with OS X 10.4 or alter'i Use Mountain Lionand its not working so i trough it away
1,DIssapointed,"This product said it was MAC compatible, but when I tried it using it, it did not work. If I had known that it wasn't going to work not only would I have not purchased it, I would not have opened it because now I cannot even return it so Im stuck with a game I can't use or return."
4,csi: crime scene investigation,"This is the first game I've ever bought for my computer. I'm enjoying the distraction but I find the crime scenes restricted. You are only allowed to look at things when the pointer turns green so all you have to do is run the pointer up and down the screen until it turns green to find any evidence that needs to be found. So there is not a chance that you will miss something. When you are trying to retrieve evidence and use the wrong item, the game tells you instead of destroying the evidence. I guess what I'm trying to say is that you are spoon fed everything and there is not much challenge. My 14 year old, on the other hand, does find the game a challenge and enjoys playing."
3,Too short of a game,I spent maybe two or three days playing this game before I finished it. Too easy for my taste but it was fun while it lasted!
2,"Much, much better books out there","I hate to disagree with the previous reviewer but I don't find this book useful at all. The how-to-stitch portion is the first 11 pages with no diagrams or pictures; the 25 stitches are shown on burlap (which is unique) but are unavailable to learn any stitch that you're not familiar with. And I defy you to discern how you're supposed to make the cutesy elephant shown. That is one of nine stylized pictures that are completely disconnected from the rest of the book. I included in the images the back cover--the only other color photo and its chart inside; I think it's hard to see how to do it.[One of my pet peeves is 8-sided snowflakes. Embroidery fabric is usually a grid but, as here, if you're going free-style--make it 6-sided!]"
2,Lavendula Angustifolia Plants,"I was very disappointed in the plants.They were only about 4"" when they are delivered,Ok.Planted in new Miracle Grow soil and babied them Three months.Two have died,one is hanging on by a thread and one is starting to grow alittle.They were planted in large pots and protected but never seem to take off and grow properly.Never had a problem getting anything else to grow.If anybody knows of a better plan for these plants let me know.Would like to be able to grow them."
4,Great for entertainment but horrible for the classroom,I bought this to preview for my World History class. There is an abundance of nudity so it is not suitable for the classroom. I was able to add information from what I viewed to my lecture to make it entertaining but I wish History Channel would make clean versions for the classroom.
4,Good supplement or introduction to the subject,"This video did just what I hoped it would: it gave my teenagers in AP European History an overview of the subject. There's a lot to the French Revolution, of course, and it can be hard to grasp the whole scope of it at once. The History Channel did a good job of presenting the whole thing, though with the usual looping and reusing of video bits (eg, you see the same legs storming Versailles a lot of times). It did a good job of unifying the whole era in the person of Robespierre, showing that he started out wanting favor from the king, had the king beheaded, and ended up a failed suicide, going to the guillotine himself. I thought it presented all of the people and issues involved clearly. This is a good resource for students who are just beginning to study the French Revolution, or who want a review."
1,"Misrepresented, but corrected","This video, a standard for Freshman World History at ""my"" high school, was listed as having closed captioning (CC). I have a hearing impaired student, and all of the videos MUST have CC. Our DVD did not. I was thrilled to find out that Amazon had it with CC! However, when it arrived, it did NOT. A phone call (yes, you CAN actually phone them) got a refund for my costs, including expedited delivery. They also removed the CC notation on the web site. Therefore I HATE the DVD for NOT coming in CC form (ALL media should be accessable to ALL students), but LOVE Amazon for making good. My library ended up having to pay around $250 for a CC DVD of this from another source. Shame on The History Channel!!!"
1,Trash,"A right-wing interpretation of the French Revolution. Like everything from the History Channel, pure garbage."
4,"Very nice, but a bit narrow in its scope","I agree with 99% of the points that the reviewers before me have written, but I found two areas of weakness in the film. First, the consequences of the Revolution are given short attention--while many mundane facts are played out to unnecessary length at the beginning of the film. Secondly, the role of Robespierre is overstated and the contributions of so many other people, forces, and groups are underreported. Both are somewhat minor quibbles. My advice to those who wish to learn about the French Revolution is to have other resources available that cover these two areas. Some background of 17th and 18th century France and Europe would be invaluable as well as providing viewers full biographies of the movers and shakers in France at the time."
5,Plenty of Detail!,"Studying the French Revolution in high school is as nothing compared to this documentary which is filled with details, some little known. This DVD is a great addition to the ""history library"" of DVDs of anyone deeply interested in history."
4,An entertaining intro to the Fench Revolution...,"This is not a completely accurate account, but hell, how could it be, it was over two hundred years ago....Some facts and other details were changed or left out, though all in all I'd say this is a pretty good introduction to one of the most important events in human history.As well, I found the actor portraying Robespierre rather fascinating to watch."
3,Overview,A decent overview of the revolution. A great deal of the details are missing. Good for learning the basics.
2,Typical Overwrought History Channel Production,"The information was reasonably good as an overview of the Revolution, but the throbbing music, almost drowning out the narration, was irritating and distracting."
3,"Not Bad, But He Has Done Better","Michael Moon is actually a fake name used by former Front and Bakers Pink front-man, Michael Franano; Bakers Pink being a revamped version of the Front.This CD has its moments, ""Only You"" being one of them (that song is now being used on J.C. Penney's commercials). ""Chanel No. 5"" rocks and resembles his former bands the most.But if you really want to find out the talents of Michael, check out his earlier band's self titled CD, The Front. Also, Bakers Pink's self titled CD is almost as good. Sadly, these two bands only did one CD each."
4,Good Music....,This album is more for people who like mellow music. The songs are amazing if you listen to the words. I think in order to appriciate the music you hav to be able to relate to the feelings of the artist. I beleive this Artist will be great.
1,zzzzzzzz....zzzzzzzzzzz....zzzzzzzzzz....,"I've heard demos with better production value. It sounds like Moon spend $15 recording this album. That being the case, he made 3 times that from me and the 2 other idiots that bought this record. Can he give me my money back?"
2,Very Rude.,"I had to take medical terminology for College and I have a 2 year old kid, times are tough so I turn to Amazon to buy most if not all textbooks I need seeing as to how I dont work, but go to school and take care of my child. This book was written in and had a bunch of pages missing, needless to say studying was very hard with the little quizzes the book had inside. VERY VERY RUDE! I will never buy from this seller EVER AGAIN."
1,I'm Not the Market for This Book,"As a heterosexual female costumer, I'm always looking for a solid book on underclothing that is not primarily designed to titillate a male audience. Sadly, this isn't it."
2,flimsy and hard to use,"When my daughter started using utensils (around one year of age), we purchased these, hoping they would be safer than the metal ones, but useful enough that she could feed herself without getting frustrated.The forks BARELY pick up food, and the spoons are very shallow. The design on the handles make it hard for a toddler to grip tightly (the handles are very thin and wide and sort of sharp on the edges- not comfortable for her to grip with her little fist).They are dishwasher safe, but we've had more luck with the heavy duty disposables sold at the grocery store. We also wash those in the dishwasher. They are easier for my daughter to use, as they actually pick up food, are easy and lightweight, and can be thrown out after a few uses.So skip these, and get some disposables. Or get a sturdy plastic fork and spoon (she's got one of those, too!) These are useless. You'd be better off with a collection of sporks from 7-11."
4,Good resourse,So far I really like it. I've tried others and this one is the best as you start out pick'n and grow from there. I find this better than strum'n and trying to grow into picking.
3,Complete Bluegrass Banjo,"Perhaps I missed something in the book description, but the accompanying CD only included sound clips. No video! Without that, the book has limited use for my purposes as a beginner.AB"
5,Simply the best,"I can hear this album for hours. Every song has a special meaning, love, politics, sex, different countries, etc. My favorite song is ""Y si amanece por fin"", very sexy. If you really like Joaquin Sabina, ""Mentiras Piadosas"" is an album that you must have."
4,Uno de los mejores albumes de Sabina,"Creo que este fue el primer album de Sabina que tuve. En todo caso, creo que fue a partir de este disco de 1990 que el español empezo a ser conocido bien en América Latina. Hay muchas canciones buenas: Pobre Cristina (sobre la entonces recientemente muerta Cristina Onassis), Eclipse de Mar (recuerdo un cover de esta cancion de Baglietto), Con la Frente Marchita (...cantaba Gardel, gran canción sobre una exiliada argentina en España), el Muro de Berlin (que ironiza sobre el entonces recientemente caido Muro, y sobre toda esa onda que habia en esa epoca que afirmaba que a partir de ese momento, se acababa la historia y todo iba a ir bien), Mentiras Piadosas, Corre, Dijo la Tortuga, etc. En fin, un album mas que recomendable, con lindas melodias y excelentes letras (como es de costumbre en Sabina)."
4,Not for begginers,"This book provides important and interesting mathematic developpements for people who are experts in speech recognition. It's really complete and helpful but we are obliged to recognize that this is, most of time, a description of the IBM ASR system. Not as general as it could ..."
3,Picture words flash cards,"Was disappointed with these cards. We used them exactly three times--by then, the kids (twins, age 3 1/2) had them all memorized. Nice concept, but not very practical for above-average kids. I could have saved money by writing the words on scrap paper. Then I wouldn't feel guilty about how little use they got!"
1,Scam,"I purchase this product. The memory card works in my phone, however the adaptor that comes with it was defective, therefore i cannot use it in my computer or any card reader. I called eek tech but they would not replace it. I paid about $4 in shipping for a $1 product. I will dispute the charges with mastercard and rate this product from this store to Zero."
1,"Placed order twice, both cancelled by Eek after a few days","I placed orders twice and received confirmation. A few days later, the order was cancelled.First order: Amazon said might be problem with my credit card, then later said it was actually cancelled by the vendor.Second order: Again cancelled a few days after the order was confirmed."
2,Trouble in paradise,"Very disappointed and actually really unhappy with the manufacturer. I loved it -- until I hated it. It broke after 2 years of very basic use. A red blinking light means the batteries are bad and can't be recharged or even reconditioned. I threw those 2 AA batteries out and bought 2 more (not cheap.) When they needed regharging I again had a red blinking light. I called the manufacturer to find out why my 2 good batteries were making the charger blink red on one side. They told me, very matter of factly, that it sounded like the charger was bad and since I've owned it for over a year they wouldn't replace it, but would give me 10% off their price -- which is high. I thought I'd just use the left side for awhile, but it's doing the same thing. It's worthless.Shouldn't have happened. I really researched before buying this product and ad sad about this result."
5,very nice charger,"I love this charger so far. I did just get it, but it is a very nice charger. You can select how fast it charges, it will trickle charge the battery for you so it's always full."
2,Red Light of Death!,"Worked great for a while, then some batteries would cause the red lamp to flash- batteries would not charge. I thought the batteries were bad, but they charge in our other unit. I think this is a fault that these chargers are at risk of developing. At this cost, and with the good rep. Powerex has, this simple charger should have higher reliability.Buy a spare!"
5,Great Battery Charger!,"I bought one of these chargers for myself last year, based on high reviews and I'm glad I did! It charges my batteries quickly and it's very easy to use. I use it all the time to charge my digital camera batteries and it has saved me so much money in batteries - well worth the price! In fact, I liked it so much, I bought one for my adult daughter last Christmas and she uses it all the time and loves it. Don't waste your money on cheaper chargers - this one is perfect!"
1,SLOW CHARGE FEATURE WAS D O A -- RETURNED,THOUGHT I FOUND THE PERFECT CHARGER.CHARGER NEVER GOT WARM ON SLOW CHARGE BUT THE RETURN BACK TO PROVIDER WAS EASY!
5,You too can learn a foreign language,"Finally, a language program that progresses at a reasonable pace. Languages are very difficult for me to learn, yet with this program I'm moving along quite rapidly. The repitition is wonderful, allowing the words to implant themselves in your long term memory. No studying, just plain and simple verbal practice, which leads to long term memory and retention.Other tapes focus on memorizing sentences and responses, without building on the fundamentals. This programs continues to build on itself so you feel confident in new situations, using new combinations of words and sentences. I can't wait to go to Italy and put it to good use."
1,fraudulent copy of VILLAGE IN THE JUNGLE,"I have bought from amazon a copy of leonard Woolf VILLAGE IN THE JUNGLE. It was meant as a present to a friend but it turns out to be a scanned copy with little connection with the original. The return menu also does not seem to work. I am seriously concerned about this kind of reproduction that amounts to fraud.Professor Gananath ObeyesekerePrinceton UniversityHome: 61 West 62nd street, #22A, NY, NY 10023"
4,delivery was a bit slow,"everything else was just fine, the quality of the book, etc. At the time of purchase I also ordered 2 other books from separate sellers which arrived almost a week sooner. Oh well, great book, good condition!"
2,Frustrating Hardware,"I will readily admit that part of this is my fault, but to me this item is impossible to install properly.I followed the directions, used their ""template"", and carefully drilled my holes. This will not go onto the door properly, and my only guess is that due to the long shaft, and the finicky turn assembly, installing this item perfectly square is nothing short of highly difficult. Maybe if I had a drill press it would work, but after 6+ hrs of adjusting this, I have given up."
1,Where's the model number,Just received this device on 5/5/2010. It has no model id or serial number. How does a company manufacture an electronic device with no model or serial number? How do you know you're getting the latest model? I called using my cell phone. No ring. The orange light came on indicating that the number was on the reject list. I displayed the reject list but no numbers were displayed. I then sent the number to the important call list. My phone rings ok now and the call goes through. The device seems to work but the programming is poor. Once you discover the workarounds I suppose it will work ok.Also when you review the calls received there is no simple way to delete that number and display the next one. You have to go through about 7 steps to delete that number from the display and then display the next one.This company gets a B for the device features and F minus for the programming of these features. The programming is terrible.
4,Thank Goodness for Amazon!,I was so glad that I was able to purchase this item to fix my Dell. Dell WILL NOT sell you a replacement part if you do not have the extended service contract. My computer would have been out at the curb if it wasn't for Amazon - because Dell is the most customer unfriendly company that I have ever had the misfortune to deal with. Thank You Amazon!
5,What an awesome debut,"I had the chance of seeing this wonderful artist in concert when this album was first released. She has such an incredible vocal range and an incredible stamina and persona. I got acquainted with her artistry upon the release of her single ""Feel what You want"" (which by the way has one the best videos of the decade) and waited eagerly for this album to come out. When it did I was beyond surprised, it was a zillion times better than what I expected. It is Jazzy; it is classy. It has some of the best lyrics that I have seen in any pop album in the past 10 years. And best of all it keeps you moving all along. It has been nearly five years since i bought this record and I still look for it when I'm in the mood for well written and produced music. Buy it ---you'll LOVE it."
2,The Marilyn Blow-Up Doll,"This may have indeed been a ""true story,"" but what an insipid movie, with Marilyn presented as little more than a blow-up doll for young Colin's pleasure. Of course, one wonders how much access young Colin Clark had to Marilyn at the time. The book came out long after the incident presumably took place, and apparently at the urging of publishers. But, my biggest gripe was with the characterizations. Branagh makes Olivier into a pompous old windbag. God knows who Julia Ormand was trying to be, certainly not Vivian Leigh. Michelle Williams provides a cuddly version of Marilyn with out much body or soul. The only two to really stand out in this film were Derek Jacobi and Dame Judi Dench in their all too fleeting supporting roles."
4,A Little Slow,"This film lacked a little in substance and seemed slow, but we really enjoyed Michelle Williams' performance. It was as if we were seeing Marilyn one more time. After the movie, I decided to watch a documentary about Marilyn Monroe and it was as if she wasn't vibrant enough in her personality. Maybe Michelle spoiled me with her imitation."
4,Good Stuff,"Worth watching. I thought it might be a bit dull and too historical, but it was an interesting story and the movie was well done."
3,Two fine actors make the movie,"Marilyn Monroe comes to London to shoot The Prince and the Showgirl with Lawrence Olivier. He is her co-star and directs. Young, connected Colin Clark is assigned to look after her. The movie seems as long as a week; it's essentially an unsatisfying anecdote stretched out to be a movie. Two actors redeem the movie, however irrelevant to anything the movie becomes: Michelle Williams as Marilyn Monroe and Kenneth Branagh as Olivier. Williams doesn't look much like Monroe but she captures the look, the style, the voice and the vulnerability. You might watch Meek's Cutoff and see if you recognize her. Branagh, if you enjoy watching Olivier as harried, condescending, impatient and ready to tear his hair out (and I did), is a joy."
2,Bad casting for Marilyn.,"I can't quite figure out why so many people see Michelle's portrayal of Marilyn as good. They look nothing alike. Michelle is too boyish to be the iconic, sexy, Marilyn Monroe, the acting doesn't fit either. I really do not know why MIchelle was cast in this role. I couldn't get past the poor casting to enjoy this movie."
3,pretty lady,"this was ok, i wish it had more, i just couldnt find anything new and exciting in this movie. to bad cause i love both Marilyn and this pretty actress."
3,my week with marilyn,movie came on time and in great condition. michelle williams was not the best choice to portray marilyn. shouldve hired christina hendricks. movie was too long; lost interest
4,As expected and delivered 1 day early,"Delivered as expected, have not yet played it but the packaging looks like they are new. I have played another and no issues."
5,Good movie!,Pretty good quality. The sound was a bit annoying. It was either too low you couldn;t hear it or way too loud
2,Michelle is great; the character is not,Michelle Williams does an amazing job; Marilyn Monroe is a sad character and her behavior is boring to watch. Watch it for Michelle only.
2,Michelle's Marilyn makeover...,"This is a cutesy-poo bit of fluff, featuring Williams' overhyped Marilyn imitation, in a tabloid story about the filming of THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL. There's plenty of cartoon psychology as Marilyn bears her soul to a nerdy assistant director while faking her way through a disastrous film directed by Laurence Olivier. It's adolescent fodder all the way, and Williams doesn't even do a good job with the superficial, incompetently inserted musical bits. It all plays like a trite TV project."
4,ONE STAR TO THE MPAA FOR GIVING THIS FILM AN R RATING,"Otherwise, I don't know how much I can say about this film... I went to see it with a couple friends, without any prior knowledge of or interest in Marilyn Monroe's films or life, and didn't feel that I came away with much more of either. What I did find it to provide, quite powerfully, was a picture of the darker side of 1950s America. A moment I found especially memorable is a scene in which a doctor calls a pregnancy a ""private matter"", very much as if it were something shameful. Which, in that time of transition from Victorian prudery to equally superficial and judgmental body-envy, it may well have been."
1,A very dull movie,This film meanders on with no real intent. It is difficult to be engaged with what is an uninteresting storyline.The only saving grace is the superb acting of Michelle Williams. Otherwise a very dull and unimpressive movie.
2,Lydia Jean,"The acting was OK but being a bit of a Marilyn fan, I found this disappointing. All the dots lined up fine but just didn't seem connected."
3,Nice but not Marilyn,"I could only give this three stars, because although it was well written and well acted, It simply wasn't Marilyn Monroe.She was a glamour icon, and I am dubious that ANYONE could portray her."
4,Not usually the type of movie I watch but....,"I found myself gripped to the story and sadness, also some sweet lighthearted parts. Know many people who didn't care for this movie but I enjoyed watching it, but it will not be a movie I will buy and re-watch again."
3,Actress 3 stars - story 1/2 star!,"Michelle Williams looked and acted the part of Marilyn very well. She became Marilyn Monroe! When she was on the screen, she lit it up. That is the only reason that this film was rated 3 stars - I have no idea who thought this story was worthy of a movie and then to get Academy Award recognition?? It seemed boring and dumb to us. The other actors were not engaging or interesting, which is a shame, and they made the story draaaaaaag. At the end, we asked - what was the point? Other than to showcase how MW can transform herself, we have no clue. Maybe it was over our heads but we were disappointed."
5,WONDERFUL,I rented this movie last night and was just captivated.I love the legend of Marilyn Monroe and i was leery about how goodthis film could be.My God what a great job Michelle Williams did.I couldsee how impossible it would be not to fall in love with MM.After the movieI went right to my Amazon account and ordered my own copy.
3,Marilyn OK,I boought this for my son for a gift and we watched it together. He really liked it...I guess I was expecting more of her life being told. It was just ok for me.
3,Michelle Williams fan but...,I love Michelle Williams' work but I was moved in any way by this film. I am not enthralled with Marilyn Monroe like everyone else seems to be and this may explain why the film was just okay to me.
3,It's ok.,Michelle William's is great as Marilyn but I just found the movie to be ehhh?!? Still worth watching but I don't know if I'd own it.
2,Mediocre at best.,"Michelle Williams put on a fantastic performance, but I found the movie itself disappointing. The story line was not very intriguing, and the movie was fairly slow."
4,Teaching Urdu to a badger,"Lawrence Olivier made a film with Marilyn Monroe, in 1957. It didn't work so well. Her next movie was Some Like It Hot.A young man on the set, Colin, had a brief friendship with her and wrote a memoir about it.English professionalism clashes with American star cult. Or maybe: English prima donna has trouble accepting little girl tantrums from American cash cow.In Colin's words: he was a great actor who wanted to be a star, while she was a star who wanted to be a great actress.In Olivier's: I tried hard to change her but she remained the same despite me.Michelle Williams does a credible job in her mission impossible impersonating the woman who struggled with being Marilyn.Branagh is a plausible Olivier.Henry James might have been rather interested.A nice little movie."
4,Well done!,"An aspiring young filmmaker spent a short time in 1956 on the set of a Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe film as an assistant director. He became close to Marilyn as many men had, and ended up a key figure in the production. Marilyn Monroe was notoriously difficult to work with in Hollywood and that is well-dramatized here. Michelle Williams IS Marilyn Monroe in this one and her performance highlights a realistic look at the difficulties that Marilyn had with trying to be a serious Hollywood actress while dealing with her insecurities and a prescription drug habit. This film was a pleasant surprise and another terrific movie to see during the holiday season."
2,Some Like it. Not.,"""My Week With Marilyn"", is based on Colin Clark's account of his time spent with Monroe during the making of the 1956 film ""The Prince and The Showgirl"" when the superstar was 30 years old. Michelle Williams embodies the troubled young starlet without always looking like Marilyn. Her performance, along with a strong cast including Kenneth Branagh, Eddie Redmayne, Dame Judi Dench,and Julia Ormond cannot, however, overcome what essentially is a rather boring story about a boring young man who spent a short time with the sexiest woman in the world. The film can be appreciated for it's period costuming, acting and behind the scenes film-wthin-a-film but not for it's weak plot."
1,Worst movie I have seen in awhile,"This love affair with Williams is unbelievable!!! She was horrible in this movie.As you can tell I don't care for this actress. The movie is sad on it's own,add Williamsyou have a complete disaster. I know I am swimming up stream with this group."
1,Overrated,Can't believe Williams got an Oscar nomination for this. I thought she was terrible as Marilyn. Plus lame script. I was really disappointed in this movie.
4,Marilyn and her Prince Charming,"This is a wonderful story of a very sad girl and an understanding boy. Colin didn't want anything from this famous actress but to be her friend. A warm and wonderful story that reminded me of what my mother told me about meeting Marilyn in the 50s while she was shooting the Seven Year Itch. My mother was a waitress working for Saverin Restaurant in Pennsylvania Station, NYC. When not shooting Marilyn would come to the restaurant, and sit at my mothers' station for coffee every so often. When my mother came home after the first day of meeting Marilyn she told me something that I could never forget. She told me that Marilyn was the saddest person she has ever met but at the same time very kind. A must see movie and one for the collection."
3,Shouldn't Marilyn Monroe be sexy?,"If you wish to portray the sexiest woman in modern history, shouldn't you at least be sexy?Michelle Williams just isn't sexy in this movie. This could have been a film about any over-stressed artist. The unapologetic sensuality of Marilyn Monroe is nowhere to be found."
3,Insight on Marilyn,I wonder how many other weeks Marilyn had like this one. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this movie in the theater but I am happy that I was able to see it.
3,My Week With Marilyn [HD],I download this movie (My Week With Marilyn [HD]) and found it enjoyable to watch. I think it is definitely worth the purchase and worth downloading.
3,Eh,"I wanted to like this movie more than i did. It was just, boring. MM had a facinating life and this part of it was just slow boring and needy. Sorry 3 stars is all i can give."
5,Superb in every way...,"I loved, loved, loved this movie from start to finish. Michele Williams is superb as Marilyn and everyone else associated with the film are perfect in their parts. I definitely want to watch this one again..."
3,A week with Marilyn,"i like this movie. excellence performance and great dialogs. again, technical issues that are becoming more frequent than never with the internet streaming. i had stopped to by the HD videos now because regardless there are going to be sudden stops during the movie. we manage to make it till the end, again good movie, it was worthy to work to fix the problem."
4,Intriguing -,During the summer of 1956 Colin Clark was just getting into the film business as a 3rd-assistant on the set of 'The Prince and the Showgirl' starring Marilyn Monroe and Sir Laurence Olivier. His diary account of his involvement in that film's making in which we became her close confidant while she was trying to escape work pressures and the company of her Hollywood hangers-on.
1,"Lovely Story, But It Didn't Happen","After watching this movie, I was intrigued to read the book it was based on, ""The Prince, the Showgirl and Me"" by Colin Clark. Although Clark certainly was on the set of ""The Prince and the Showgirl,"" and although he certainly had opinions about Monroe and Olivier, he certainly did not have a personal relationship with Monroe that was the core of the movie. I am accustomed to movies, even those about real people, taking liberties with events described in books for dramatic affect, but this kind of wholesale manufacturing I find completely unacceptable."
3,Glad it was a few hours to watch...,"While not outright terrible, this movie was mediocre at best. I give the cast credit for tackling such a complex set of icons, and almost selling it. But, sadly they fell just short. I found myself watching them at one point and realized I felt like I was trying to mentally morph them into who they were supposed to be and was disappointed with myself when I couldn't see past it being Michelle Williams, etc.I wouldn't watch it more than the once, but like I said it wasn't outright terrible. Maybe someone who really really loved Marilyn would find it more a fascinating character study."
4,Remarkably eloquent!,"Michelle Williams does a fantastic job portraying the two sides of Marilyn. Eddie Redmayne, in his portrayal of Colin Clark, is remarkably eloquent! The scene between Williams and Redmayne, Marilyn at 31 and Clark at 23, at the all boys private high-school Clark graduated from in England, is so magical that you really must see it! Marilyn, on a day-break from the shooting schedule, at the high-school, when confronted by a group of students, turns to Clark and says, ""Should I become that other girl?"" Words don't give this scene justice. A transfixing moment that can only be seen and heard to truly comprehend the depth of enlightenment this moment had to offer yours truly. The entire movie is a highly refined tragedy, which may make watching it a bit of a drag. But, the best part of this movie-going experience was reflecting afterwards on its perfect composure and innocence."
4,Hard not to like due to Michelle Williams performance!,"This was a delightful surprise.Michelle Williams gave a beautifully evocative performance as Marilyn Monroe supported by a great ensemble of Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier, Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh and Dame Judi Dench as Sybil Thorndike. Eddie Redmayne did a beaut job as the besotted young man by Marilyn's damsel in distress performance. To be fair he wasn't the only person, male and female, to be besotted by Monroe's girlish innocence and sensual aloofness.The audience can only feel empathy towards Williams enchanting impression of Marilyn as she struggles with her insecurities of self-acceptance and desire to be loved. It is still amazing that the ""most loved woman in the world"" at the time found it so difficult to love herself.Thoroughly recommend whether or not you are a fan of Monroe."
2,What was the point of this movie?,"The movie was a good platform for Michelle Williams to stretch herself to be Marilyn. She did a pretty good job. However, Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier wasn't believable, except for the voice. There was nothing about Marilyn in this movie that I didn't already know, as I was waiting for some BIG moment. It never came. There was no point to this movie being made, so there's no point going further."
1,Yawn!,"Although Michelle portrayed her in a non campy way -- like many others have in the past, the film was a complete YAWN. It just wouldnt move along and I almost stopped it half way through but I thought I better see how the end turned out ( Well we all know how the end turned out for the real Marilyn) I am talking about the movie silly LOL --- and I still give it a BIG YAWN!"
2,meh,"Fine enough acting, but it is really not that interesting of a story. Two fairly uninteresting people have an affair and some uptight English people get uptight about it.Oh, sorry, I just spoiled it."
2,Never got to see the end!,"We streamed this movie, which was OK, except that we were never able to see the end. Heard sound but no video."
3,not what I expected but okay,I thought this was going to be a pocket guide to restaurants like I used to have. It is missing a lot of restaurants. I believe the nutrition information is inaccurate in places cause my blood sugar raised when it shouldn't have.
4,Eating Out Guide,"If you eat out or on the run, this is a great book to have in the car. Make better decisions"
2,At A Glance,"I glanced through the pages available on Amazon. This book contains some very bad advise. It seems this book is only focusing on low fat instead of foods low in the glycemic index. Many of the suggestions, like choose a bagel with low fat cream cheese at one restaurant, would send a type 1's blood sugar super high. I have been told by my nutritionist to never eat a whole bagel. If I can't avoid a bagel for breakfast, I should only eat half of it. The next edition has just been released. It is not available on Amazon yet. Hopefully, it is a little better."
2,Not What I Expected.,This book did not help me as much as I was hoping. I just needed a simple guide for when I go out to eat I can quickly look to see what would be a better choice.
3,Good Parts & Bad Parts,"The book was a decent read, although the standard brother getting mad at white people is old. The main character is Troy in his first year of college. He seems to find racism almost everywhere and in most cases where it is not. He makes the basketball team and quits after think the coach is racist. He even turns to Islam for a way to solve his problems.I was able to read the book in two days and the main thing that annoyed me was the character turning to Islam for help. Nothing really wrong with it, but almost every black character (Boys in the Hood, Belly & Menace 2 Society) want to become Muslim. Yet the one character that turned to Christianty was shunned by everyone."
1,WHAT A JOKE!,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE story! The main character is a complete sociopath so blinded by the 'racism' he sees that he becomes a racist himself. He goes through the entire book saying how white people have everything perfect and how Martin Luther King was a fool for believing in intergration and equality. Don't waste your money on this garbage."
2,A Griot he is not,"""College Boy"" was a big disappointment. I must say that since his very first book, I've not be a huge Omar Tyree fan. I was hoping that his Urban Griot counterpart had something new and fresh to offer. That said this book was one big whining session. Troy Potter looks at his world and only sees trouble. He decides that the world is out to get him. That whites and women are trouble. Yes there is trouble out there to impede the progress of Af-Am males, Troy however only goes so far as to recognize the trouble and whine about it for 384 pages. This would have been a much more satisfying story if he endeavored to doing something constructive about.This was my last run with Omar Tyree and the Urban Griot."
4,My 8yo loves this stroller!,"My 8 yo daughter loves her new stroller. It's perfect for walking with dolls, or stuffed animals as she prefers. It even has a little storage bottom for any small extras like her purse or a blanket. It was extremely easy to put together and seems to be very well made. The wheels roll easily and are balanced properly for a smooth stroll. I gave 3 stars for durability only because the seat material is a bit thin and is definitely not intended for anything other than toys. If your kids are like mine, they sometimes want to ""ride"" too, but that would ruin this stroller. However, it's perfect for its intended use, dolls and stuffed animals! We are very happy with our purchase. :)"
1,Not worth it,"I purchased for my daughter, their is no center strap to keep the doll in stroller. Each time she straps her doll in the stroller, the doll slides out. The seats aren't designed to keep the doll in the stroller. Also, the foam around the handle bar pulled apart after two weeks giving her this item. I purchased before Christmas, and gave it to her in January for her birthday. I wish I had bought from another store, I know the quality would have been much better."
4,Stroler Review,A good buy and a real fun item for a little girl. Our granddaughter took right to it and started pushing it all over the house.
5,Could not be happier!,We LOVE this stroller. It is well made and will grow with her. I love that this stroller is large enough that she can still enjoy pushing her babies around at 5 years old. Some other strollers we have she was already too big for. She loves that she can take to babies in the stroller. Great product.
4,"Good, not great",The overall frame seems great and sturdy. The seats are somewhat lacking and my daughters dolls keep sliding off them. The straps lack a center piece to keep the dolls in place and the rear seat is rather flimsy.
4,A HIT FOR SURE,"I got this for my 5 year old for christmas, SHE LOVES IT!!!! She has been playing with it non stop! My complaints about it are.... The seats are just a thin material that extend down over the foot rest, IT COMES OFF THE FOOT REST ALL THE TIME. I also think the wheels/axles are a little iffy. But she loves it and hopefully it lasts!On the positive side the adjustable handle is great my 15 month daughter can hold on to the handle fine and then be adjusted for my 5 year old with still room to grow."
5,Fast delievery !,"I bought this on Oct 29th and it was on my front porch by the 1st of Nov ! I ordered it for my daughters 2cd birthday which is in a few weeks so i cant tell how long it will last but it looks like its well build and i only had to assemble a few things , super easy ! I liked it a lot !I certainyl would recommend it to everyone !Thanks !"
3,Respectable jangle from 1994 San Jose,"Surprisingly beefy in parts, predictably jangly in most, this sole album from this San Jose, CA trio, 1994, shows the sound of indie bands influenced by REM and college radio respectably. I had heard a standout track on a Slumberland Records compilation years ago, by far the best song on the record, and looked for this release. The last track, Supernova, shows that the group could shed their alternative-early-90s influences and rock out in extended fashion as did their Bay Area forebears twenty-five years earlier.There's nothing earthshattering on this disc, but solid performances, no embarassingly dated recording styles, and a devotion to songcraft make this, if not truly original, then still a fine example of garage-band ambition combined with a knowledge of tunefulness and modest yet confident, accomplishment. Fans of the janglier side of the indie scene will like this unassuming but self-assured set of cheery tunes."
5,"Homecare is a ""cookbook"" on how to do it.",I was the primary care provider when my wife had lung cancer. When my 94 year old mother fell I was lucky enough to get a copy of the book. It provides answers without time consuming research. I was so impressed I bought a dozen copies for friends and family.
5,Helps deal with all aspects of setting up homecare.,"I found the book most useful as it gave me inside views of the worker and patient that I, as an advocate, had not thought of. It verified a lot of feelings and frustrations I have had in assisting my mother with her care and gave me new angles to use in my planning with her. I was grateful to find an uncluttered index and the large type makes it easy to find information throughout the book. I wish I had had this book five years ago, when care for my mother first became necessary."
2,A real disappointment,"The Bible Study of this book is a real disappointment. The study guide is a verbatim of the DVD and the questions are redundant. While my study group liked the videos, we weren't challenged at all by the week's homework. It seems like the repeat of the same questions was just to fill up pages. Sorry but this one didn't live up."
2,Disappointing.,"I loved the first book ""Fallin In Love With Jesus"" and I was excited to read this book, but it fails on many accounts. I don't think the authors knew what they were talking about. It was almost as if they were just tryiing to write another book."
2,Split band adjustable ring.,"This ring is just okay. I don't like that it is adjustable. Why is it listed by size if it is adjustable. I never would have ordered it. Not only do I think adjustable rings are uncomfortable, they also look cheap. The face is okay, but not nearly as nice as I expected. I bought this when it was on sale and am still sending it back."
3,I Will Die Beautifully Today!,"In his memoir, Tadayoshi Sakurai takes readers to places they rarely venture: a death-dealing world of machine guns, grenades and swords -- The Russo-Japanese War.Sakurai, a Japanese Army Lieutenant, shows a keen sense for detail in chronicling his role in Japan's siege of Port Arthur -- Imperial Russia's most important Far Eastern Naval Base -- from the landing of the Japanese forces in Manchuria until his wounding while storming the fortress.The personal anecdotes and graphic details about how he copes with life in camp and on the battlefield draw the reader in even when the writing is very poetic. He writes his memoir in the self-sacrificing traditional Japanese military spirit. It's fanatical, close-minded and very intolerant, but it's never stale.""Human Bullets: A Soldier's Story of the Russo-Japanese War"" was first published in Japan where it became somewhat of a literary sensation."
5,The Dressmaker,Loved this book. Made me laugh and cry. Rosalie Ham writes a great story. Have also loved her other 2 books.
5,"I'm addicted, but have no plans of giving it up.","I walked into a swing club recently and by the time my ears caught the music coming from the stage, I was so hooked that I couldn't even stop for a cocktail (which is an oddity). The band's name - JET SET SIX. It was like stumbling across a Big Bad Voodoo Daddy before they were big.Attention swing lovers - JET SET SIX's orchestrations are tight and they harmonize much better than several other swing bands right now. Their patterns aren't always in unison, which gives them that big, solid, sometimes brassy and sometimes subtle sound.I bought their CD, Livin' It Up, and it hasn't left the CD player. Especially pleasing are the smooth vocals and the everyday lifestyle lyrics that we can all relate to.Get in on this band EARLY so you can be one of the folks who heard them before they hit it big...because I believe the will. They deserve it!"
1,"I know the truth about this so-called ""book""!","I bought this quite a while back.... I know what this thing is REALLY about. It's a small, verysmall booklet that has a look of it being put together in just aday. There is nothing helpful in here at all. Not even from apsychological point of view, or how to have a successful relationshipwith a beautiful woman. It's all hype. I returned this after I readit, which took less than an hour. It looks just like those littlebooklets you see at the check out counter. There's nothing here. ...."
5,Good book with Great tips,"This is a great book, This is the first time i have felt compelled to write a review. I have read many book`s on the subject and this is the first with an honest no b.s. approch. this is the real deal guy`s"
2,Second Review for this Product...,"...because my first one was removed. I didn't use any bad language, I wasn't out of line, but my first review didn't last one day on here.So what did I say that was so out of line?I said this wasn't a book, it was a pamphlet. At 76 pages, you can read it in one sitting. There are a few good pointers in the early chapters...but the rest is simple beyond belief. There's a chapter about how you should, once you get your beautiful wife, set short-term goals and long-term goals, followed by another chapter about how--with your beautiful wife--have beautiful children and make them set short-term goals and long-term goals for them.Yes, it's very simple and refreshingly wholesome material, but it's also very thin and numbingly basic for twenty dollars."
2,Basic concepts,"A friend of mine recommended to read this book, so I gave it a shot.I found this book to contain a number of basic concepts. Not only fordating but for realizing your true worth. It tended to aim towardspeople who don't have the self confidence to talk to a physicallyattractive human being.If you are confident inyourself...[y]ou'll find this lacking."
5,love this book-one of the best,"I just love this book. I am a author myself and have been selling books of mine on meeting women for years. Bob Lott's Don't Be Afraid To Ask is one of the best books I have read in years. It has many many skills on how to master the art of meeting and understanding beautiful women. I can say in a few words that after reading this book any man can meet, date and even marry a beautiful woman. You cannot fail after reading Bob's book"
1,This book is overpriced and unhelpful,"This book is short, small (about the size of a wallet), supremely overpriced, and wrong. Amazingly, though the title of the book is ""Don't Be Afraid To Ask!!"" the author entirely omits advice about summoning up the courage and technique to ask a beautiful woman out on a date! Most, if not all of the ""information"" in the book is just common sense. This book is not worth the cost of paper and ink that were used to produce it, yet the price is ...!"
1,A total disaster,"Although I realized that the title should use the word Scots, rather than Scotch, I ordered the book anyway. When it arrived, I was a bit puzzled to see that the cover of the book, while it had the title ordered, had what looked to be a picture of very high mountains covered with snow. A bit much for the Appalachian mountains, I thought. Imagine my surprise when, upon opening the book, I discovered that the text concerned expeditions on Mount Everest! I contacted the company through Amazon and their response was that the one THEY had was just fine, albeit with the questionable mountain pictured on the front. I then had to tell them the titles of chapters, etc. They have since emailed me and have promised to send me the ""correct"" text at no charge. So far I have not received it.In short, I have been unhappy with dealing with Amazon.com before. This is my last time, rest assured."
2,Disappointed,"When I opened the book to check the pages,I found some pages of the Appendices had been cut off of the page.Some of the names were cut off, so that you only got a part of the names.Even the APPENDIX III and VI had names that were cut off.The page numbers are 327,329,331,339,341,343,345.Other than that, the book is in good condition, as far as I can tell."
4,New England Scotch Irish migration,"The book is a gem for genealogists searching for Scotch Irish Ancestors who migrated through New England in the 1718 to 1750 era. It deals primarily from a ministers point of view, but is descriptive of the hardships from intolerance of the Puritans and the frontier.This is one of the classics in Scotch Irish history."

1,This is NOT Darkwater from Norway and they really SUCK!!!!,I bought this CD believing it to be the fantasic band from Norway. It is NOT. As far as I can tell this is a Death Metal band from PA?? from the liner notes. Amazon says it was released in 2006 and the liner notes say 1999. Either way avoid this CD like the plague. I am not even going to attempt to sell the copy here on Amazon because I would not feel right even charging $1.00 for this poor sounding CD. These guys try to sound like Anthrax and without much luck. I hope this prevents anybody else from wasting $15.00 thinking they are getting the Darkwater band that has the one CD entitled - 'Calling the Earth to Witness' which is a FIVE STAR CD all the way and might be the best CD I have heard in awhile. Peace.
1,Intentional or Not This is a SCAM,"The usual amount of research on Amazon/B&N; and other musical sites will tell you CRAP and point you to this CD as the same groups as the REAL one that releasedCalling The Earth to WitnessandWhere Stories End. Yes I am SO glad the other reviewer did save many of us from buying a crap CD that was NOT the one that Amazon/B&N; and many other sites tell you that lie because THEY were too lazy to research. About the only place you can find the correct info is the publisher page Ulterium Records and even then they don't tell you this CD is crap, they just don't list it."
5,A must read.,"As an avid fan of fantasy literature, I'd have to say this book was excellent. There is a lot of rich detail with every setting, and the characters are very fleshed out. I'd recommend this book to people who are both veterans of fantasy literature or new to it. This book leaves you wanting more."
4,Nice tune with great sampling,This is just a track I fell in love with going to raves in the late 90's while in college. Great times. Good music.
1,Didn't Come Together,"I've read most everything that Hollis has written. His style is quite difficult, but most always worth while. The point he makes is normally deep and meaningful. Except this book. Either I just don't have the intelligence to find it, or the point is simply not there. This book just didn't come together."
3,medora sale books,I bought books by Medora Sale because I have enjoyed and reread her books written as Caroline Roe about Issac. I don't remember much about her books by Medora Sale other than I don't remember them or the characters.Winifred Toledo
4,questionnaire,"constructions of questionnaire, how u can create or formulate and also to prepare questionnaire. and about the different kinds of questionnaire"
5,A Masterwork.,"This is an album of great depth and beauty. Where in some ways it could be seen as Old Rottenhat part 2, it still merits credit in it's own right and could be seen as one of his greatest works. Wyatt brilliantly plays all the instruments here presenting brilliantly sparse yet rich, mature songs, sounds and rhythms. This is a recording that will both grow on you and sustain you over time. Robert Wyatt is truly a unique and original artist one deserving of a significant place in the history of contemporary music. Highly recommended...Simon"
3,Work gloves withpalomino grain pigskin,"Keep the hands warm, but bulky and cumbersome.Looked all over for size XL gloves for my husband, and finally found these. A lined jersey, no cuff glove, size XL is what he really wanted, but they all seem to be in size large only."
4,"fits medela pump, make sure to use the inner ring!","it does the job that i wanted it to do...which is to fit a medela pump and pump directly into an avent bottle. however, i noticed that milk leaks to the outside of the bottle while pumping. this has happened quite a few times, which is very disappointing. i finally figured out that you need to use the inner rubber ring with the converter. in retrospect, i missed something that was pretty obvious, but i wish there were some instructions that specified this."
5,Answer to my prayers,"I hated switching from a standard bottle to the avent bottle and now I can just pop an avent bottle on my original pump. I am going to clear out all of my ""normal"" bottles and only have the avent bottles in the house. This is going to clear up so much space."
1,Doesn't fit Lansinoh Double Affinity Pump,"I attempted to find out from Internet searches and a call to Philips whether this conversion kit would work with my Lansinoh Double Affinity pump. No source would clearly state which pumps the product works with, only that it fits most standard pumps. There aren't really that many electric pumps out there - you'd think Philips could just purchase one of each and give consumers a list of compatible pumps. But I digress. For less than $10, I figured I'd give it a shot. Short story - neither converter that comes in the kit will fit my pump."
4,great item,"I found it very useful to pump directly on avent bottles, it saves a lot of time and above all saves milk. Great buy if you are using a medela pump but feed your baby with avent bottles, so you avoid transferring milk to another container."
5,Useful purchase,I have been using this product with Avent bottles for the past couple of months. Its very easy to use and saves time by allowing you to pump and feed from the same bottle.
5,Awesome!,Perfect for pumping directly into my Avent bottles using my Medela pump!! This makes feeding my twins a breeze when I need a bottle.
2,Leaky!,I am currently using the adapters to connect my Medela Symphony Kit to my Avent bottles.Cons:1. The adapters leak where it screws into the bottle. It is very annoying to pump and still leak milk all over your clothes.Pros:1. It can be used with Medela kits.
5,Home is where love is,"A really interesting take on surrogacy. I loved the main character, Lucienne, and so wanted things to work out for her. What a great read!"
1,Horrible book,"As an implementer of MPLS, I have been keeping track on MPLS development since its inception. Few days back, I was in B&N and saw this book lying on a table. It took me 15 minutes to realize that this book is a totally useless. I would instead suggest MPLS by Yakov Rekhter for beginners."
3,A Multi-Protocol Label Switching description,I have found very illustrative and clear description on Multi-Protocol Label Switching
4,Adults' Fairy Tale,"It is a true fable where all is well that ends well. Mr. Reiner writes with ease about persons with distinguished achievements, wealth, and health. Even the ones who are sick are made to seem fit. There is a reason behind everything and each character possesses great human values such as compassion and understanding. Even the ogre of the tale has his good sides. Of course, the whole story is light and full of mirth. That is Mr. Reiner's style. He knows how to make people laugh. There is a minor story within the main story. Both are equally enjoyable. Nat, the main character, suffers from serious personality disorder that he succumbs to seeing a therapist. One thing leads to another and he is on the journey of searching the truth of his origin. He finds out a lot of information and a few close relations. It is first and foremost a love story between men and women and among family members. When told in Mr. Reiner's wild humor, it becomes more pleasing."
4,"Fun, witty and a quick enjoyable read","Carl Reiner, has taken on the Bible and written a cleaver and interesting story as well. NNNNN is about a successful writer who starts talking to himself, actually having real conversations with himself, and who thinks he is going crazy. He goes to see a psychiatrist who he finds in the phone book and this starts off a series of coincidences that change his life completely. Along the way Reiner rewrites Genesis, actually the story of Cain and Able and explains why we are not the result of incestuous relations but of....."
4,"LOL, Witty","Loved the story......especially the part of the book of Genesis.....interesting ""human"" look into Adam, Eve, Cain and Abel....A true man's perspective......Like it.....Must read this book."
2,Not so much ...,"In general, I've loved Carl Reiner's work. His early TV roles with Sid Caesar, his 2000-year-old man with Mel Brooks; all brilliant. But this book ... eh, not so much. I thought it rambled too much, and it just wasn't very funny. In an interview at the end of the audiobook, Reiner readily admits that he wrote the book a page a time, not having any idea what would come next, and that's the way it reads; not many ideas. I know that method works for some writers, but in this case it didn't. And the title; gee, I wonder how many seconds he thought about that one! Five, maybe?"
3,3 1/2 stars,"I listened to the unabridged version, and though it wasn't a captivating story it was pleasant and somewhat humorous. It was read by Carl Reiner, who did a good job overall, including his characters accents. If you happen to see it in the library, you might want to give it a shot."
5,Stands the test of time,"Originally published in 1957, this poignant and charming novel tells of a young man's struggle to fit in. Love, family and all the ups and downs that go with them are told with bittersweet humor. Its re-release is a wonderful companion to David Henry Hwang's new theatrical book which revives the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical on Broadway this year. Hurrah!"
5,A charming,"My mother has always told me of a beautiful Rogers & Hammerstein musical called ""Flower Drum Song"". I bought the CD and found it simply splendid. However, my appreciation of the musical has only been enhanced by reading the novel it was based on by the author CY Lee. The story follows the intrigues of a Chinese emigrant family living in San Fransisco. It is romantic, in parts funny and a pleasure to read. I thoroughly recommend it."
4,Good Thriller,"I saw this on TV last night on USA Network and it was real good. It was basically a chase movie. There was this guy in this weird car going around kidnapping kids and one of the kids' moms who drove a mini bus was following him around trying to catch him. It's not really scary but it does have its creepy moments.Anyway, it's a pretty good movie and it's worth at least one rent if you're looking for a good thriller.Also, here are some other thrillers I recommend that are real good: THE GLASS HOUSE, DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE, THE GOOD SON. See those."
2,a non-stop chase between a mini-bus and a scary black car,A California Mining Town is haunted by a child molestor in a dusty black '74 Dodge Charger. The lead role is a lady who drives a school bus with a racing engine under the hood. The black car and bus race through out the entire flick which is best viewed late at night. This movie makes you run in fear when you see a dusty balck car.
1,You've got to be kidding...,"In all seriousness, this is one of the worst things I have ever made myself watch. Beware of this movie at all costs. It will suck you in much like the facination with a car or train wreck can. This has some of the worst acting, bad writing, and ridiculous effects I have ever seen. If you and your friends have a ""bad movie night"", then this is for you..."
3,Fish Food,"It reminded me of fish food. I just couldnt get past that. The flavor isn't bad, but the texture was strange."
1,Full of GMO's?,"I have not tried Red Star brand nutritional yeast. My local co-op sells it. I wanted to know the answer to 'how is it produced? No one seemed to know, so I went online and found (quite easily) that Red Star Nutritional Yeast is cultured/grown on beet sugar. Since almost all sugar beets are now Genetically Modified, I can only assume that this yeast is full of Genetically Modified Organisms. I opted not to buy, but found that Amazon offers an organic nutritional yeast which I have instead opted to buy. Since I haven't actually eaten this product I cannot make any claims on taste, etc. Just my thoughts on the health aspects of it."
2,Not Vegan!,I'm disappointed. I was trying to buy Nutritional Yeast because I recently went vegan and when I received this I read the ingredients... it has BOTH MILK AND EGGS in it! WTF? What a waste of $9.
4,great on savory dishes as a salt substitute,"I may have strange taste buds, but i find adding Red Star Nutritional Yeast to salads, soups, fresh veggies and dips adds a nice savory, earthy flavor. I've started using it as a salt substitute. Gotta love that!"
5,Great Parmesan Taste,"This is a great cruelty-free alternative to dairy cheeses. I use it on everything I used to use parmesan on, mainly Italian sauces and dishes, but it's also good in tofu scrambles, and cheesy sauces. Plus it's also packed with B vitamins, including B12, which I need ways to sneak into my diet after having gone vegan. It did take me awhile to get used to, but now that I have, I can't get enough of the stuff."
5,Superior product,"I am a new vegetarian and needed something to boost the flavor of my vegetables. Well, I bought Red Star Nutritional Yeast. I can honestly say, I use it every single day. It is the best tasting, flavor-enhancing ""spice"" I've purchased. You will not be disappointed. It gives my egg white omelettes the best taste. It also gives all vegetables a very pleasing taste without adding additional sodium. I'm going to purchase 2 next time. Good job, Red Star!"
3,Seriously? Wow!,"I bought this to go in a faux Doritos Nacho Cheese seasoning recipe. Like most spices/seasoning, I tasted it by itself first. Was I shocked to find out it tasted like a fried pork chop! :) For once health food doesn't taste lousy. I'm finding all kinds of things to add this to now. Seriously surprised."
5,red star yeast,"This is very great yeast.looked all over to get it and found it on amazon..I use it in a lot of products..Great on popcorn and veggies..It has a lot of b12 vitamins in it..very good for you.i also make a topping of yeast, water and grapeseed oil, and put it on baked potatoe,,yummy..Red Star Nutritional Yeast..p/s ( grapeseed vegenaise spread)"
3,Nice flavor,"I was kind of curious about how this tasted, and bought this as a supplement since I don't really eat meat much. I like the flavor, it's earthy and adds a little richness to soups and potatoes. I think some people think nutritional yeast tastes a bit cheesy, but I didn't get that from these flakes."
4,Good time killer,"Lots of stuff to keep your interest up. It doesn't seem to have things to get stuck on, and there are lots of things to learn as you meet other characters and collect bells (money) and stuff to decorate your house."
4,It's a fun game but could have more games and points,"This game is interesting and fun. But not thrilling. Should have more games, characters,points etc...but overall it's a good game but I wouldn't pay full price for it. Second hand was the best alternative. The delivery was 100% perfect. On time and the game was delivered in perfect condition."
4,Addicting game,My 9-year old daughter has had this game for a few weeks now and is addicted to it. I've watched her play it and seems like a suitable game for her.
4,animal crossing: wild world,"well not much to say if you liked the game cube version you'll like the ds version, small tweaks and changes here and there but its the same game in the end. i liked it."
4,Animal Crossing is Awesome,"Animal Crossing is a great game. I spend hours on it, and I never get bored. There is always a new challenge with this game. I highly recommend it for others."
5,Excellent Escapism for fans of Life Simulations,"I recently bought the game and am very pleased with the game. Wild World offers a fun, and extremely unique little microcosm for users to explore and interact with. More importantly, the constant changes that occur in game keep you coming back again and again to discover something new about the game.With that said, this is certainly not a game for everyone. Wild World will be the most fun and offer the most opportunities for gamers who can find enjoyment doing mundane tasks like gathering apples and writing letters. More than anything, this is a game that will not be enjoyable for gamers looking for quick thrills-a-minute gameplay.If you can be won over by the sheer uniqueness and charm of the characters, and have a penchant for fishing, Wild World is certainly an excellent buy."
5,good but the wi fi isnt that good,my freind got this game and you cant just be wallking and find a person you have to get the code from your freind and then you have to add the code to your freinds list and then you have to go to a plase that will put you online and then you have to choose a freindand then you can play him and som i think the game is good the graphics are unbeleveable for a handheld and so if you think you just walk andb then you find someone then your wrong but overall for the wi fi connechin is hmmmm..... 4stars out of ten so if you do think that then your wrong
3,Cool...But Restricted,"I got this game for Christmas and I really love it! But I am very disapointed that you have to have someone from out of town shop at Nook's for it to become Nookington's.And I really want the hair salon! Doing this was easy on the first game; Just make a town on another memory card, travel to your old one and POOF Nookington's!Linking is harder than it seems. I don't know anyone, ANYONE who owns this game so DS to DS linking is out of the question for me. And I'm not so sure about letting a complete stranger in through Nintendo WFC (even though I'll probably do that)especially since I have to create a Nintendo account. But over all I say buy the game. And having a friend buy it too would help!"
3,"Watch out for ""Resetti""","""Animal Crossing: Wild World"" seems to be an engrossing and highly entertaining game. However, if one forgets to save settings before shutting down the game, a very nasty little character pops up upon restarting. This mole,""Resetti,"" is VERBALLY ABUSIVE to the player and is very hard to get rid of. There is no excuse for a game to require a child to grovel (typing out things like ""I'm an idiot,"" to choose a pleasant one!) and apologize to a bunch of nasty little pixels. The real world is plenty mean enough. Nintendo should be ashamed of itself for allowing this character to exist.Too bad to have such a black mark on an otherwise fun and creative game."
3,I don't get it...,"I guess I don't understand the rave reviews over this game. I was hooked on it the first few days and then realized how little there is to do. I haven't used the wi-fi aspect of the game, so maybe that's what I'm missing. How much fossil digging, fruit burying, and pointless errand running can you do? Most of the items you collect can't even actually be used. Your neighbors have all the same few personalities regardless of who it is. What's the point? I just don't get it..."
5,AC RAWKZ!,"I own a Nintendo DS. For the holidays, my bud recived it as a gift, and was playing it. I kept pointing, ""What's that?!"" ""The Able Sister's shop,"" she replied. I was facinated and just HAD to go buy it (which I did). I enjoy playing this a lot. (HINT: K.K. Slider plays at the Coffee Shop [the Roost] on Saturday nights from 7:30-10:00PM)I hope all of you decide to give this as a gift, or buy it for yourself. I enjoy it ALOt, and it could be for any age."
3,"Fun, but not for long","When I first got this game, I was really excited because of all the great reviews. I too got sucked into it very quickly and enjoyed a lot. That said, I also quickly got bored of it. After just a few short weeks, I took it back to Gamestop and used it as a trade-in for something else.Overall, it's fun at first, but doesn't last that long."
4,Good for any Animal Crossing Fan,"If you already know and enjoy the Animal Crossing series, this is a must have. To those new to the game, I would recommend the Game Cube or Wii version first. It's a lot more interactive/fun than trying to use a small handheld to learn a new game.I am astounded at the number of 1 star reviews I am seeing because of ""Mr Resetti"". He only appears if you can't remember how to save and quit, so if you remember to simply press a button before turning off your DS you never EVER have to see him."
5,best game we have ever bought....the kids love it,This is a great game. we are very happy with it. The kids both love it and we may buy another.
2,GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!,"i have this game, and it's really cool. you can get up to 4 people in your house. you can design stuff and arrange your house. you sell things to tom nook, but he can get really annoying. you get neighbors too and i have one called marina. at first i thought she was a pig, but she is an octopus. when you talk with her and she gets sad (little purple-and-black swirly things pop up over her head) if you keep talkin her voice gets low. also if you talk to people too much they get really crabby and they get mad when you hit them on the head with a net over and over. there is soooooooo much other stuff in this game, but if i told about all of it my review would be really long, and you people should just discover this game for yourself. GET ANIMAL CROSSING!!!! bye:) p.s. a dog gives you songs on saturdays at 8pm in the cafe in the museum!"
5,Animal Crossing The best game in the world!,I think animal Crossing Wild World is the best game there is. If you find a coconut on the ground bury in along the sand and it will become a coconut tree. Shoot gulliver out of the sky and the ufo.Go to cheatcc.com for the best hints and tips!
3,Fun for a while...,"...but then it just starts to get really old. Don't get me wrong, I'm not someone who expects every game to have quests/goals/etc. and to be extremely intense. I like ""casual"" games. For the first few weeks of playing, it was pretty fun. I liked paying off the house, figuring out how to catch fish, and growing trees. However, once the novelty wore off, it just became boring. I guess that's just me. I understand the fun and addictive-ness that people find, but I guess for me it just didn't last very long. It just seemed like the same thing hundreds and hundreds of times. If you like this about games, great. I just don't, I suppose."
5,Awesome Game!!!!!!,"Animal Crossing is one of the best games I've ever played!!!!!!! You get to create your character and name him or her, then you move into your house. You have to work for the shopkeeper,Tom Nook, to get some bells (money) after you see your house. You can buy items at the shop with bells. Tom Nook's shop expands as you play the game and so does your house. You pay off loans to make you house bigger and better. Animals live in your town but you're are human. This is a wonderful game and I highly recommend it to everybody!!!!!!!!"
5,8 and 10 year olds love it,"My kids (boy aged 10 and girl aged 8) both love this game. My son is normally into Star Wars type games and my daughter is not interested in computer type games at all, but they both play this game alone and together. I especially like the fact that they can play at the same time with each other without fighting! They can take their DS's with them in the car, on an airplane, waiting at the doctor's office.In the game, the kids construct their own world and ""earn"" money in the form of ""bells"" by catching fish or harvesting fruit, etc. They invest their bells and purchase goods. They deal with insurance and even mortgages. The game involves quite a bit of reading as characters interact with the kids. How many third graders can spell ""mortgage"" or even know what one is? It is not an educational game, by any means, but it does introduce a few real-world financial concepts."
4,"Great, but was expecting more","Animal Crossing is a wonderful game, even if you don't have the GameCube version like me. But I was expecting more. The commercial was kinda exaggerating like how the characther said ""I caught a zebra turkeyfish!"" I thought you could sorta IM in a way to other ""crossers."" But actually you just say it out loud and nothing happens. *cricket chirps* But otherwise the game's great with the graphics and you never get bored with fishing, catching bugs, and mingling with your neighbors. Should ya buy it? Yeah, but if you are into fighting and adventure, I don't reccomend it."
5,Excellent Adventure Game,"If you haven't played Animal Crossing before on the GameCube, then its hard to describe this game. Basically you play a character that is new in town and performs chores and tasks to earn your keep. Even a hardcore/violent gamer like myself found this game to be fun. As far as ""tame"" games go, this one is fun enough for anyone. I highly recommend it."
5,Yay,This game is amazing. YUou play and unlock more and make friends. The Ds to Ds is fun and I haven't tried the Wi-Fi. Buy this!!
5,A great game...and I've just started it!,"Ok, so I do admit, since I haven't heard of the orginial Animal Crossing for gamecube (because I don't have one), I was a little ""iffy"" on getting it. But all my firends said it was a great game. Anyway, it's like The Sims, but...well, all your friends are animals..literally. You start off in a taxi with a sailor/ whale thing asking you questions such as, 'What's your name"" or ""Where are you going?"" I liked the fact that I could make up my own city name (and still not have to run it). It's set up so it's the same season as it is in the real world. I've just started...but I can tell that I'll enjoy it...an so will you...hopefully."
3,Crossing,"I purchased this game for my 9 year old sister. She has a DS and she knows how to use it but this game gave her some problems. I even had some trouble with it and I'm 22. I wouldn't highly recommend it in anyone under10. Also, my copy still had the previous owner's saved information on it. Easy to get rid of but still should have been taken care of already."
2,boring,You just walk around and talk to people.The only fun part is getting music from KK Slider the dancing dog.
2,"Boring, and mediocre graphics.","I don't really understand the point of this game. I'm guessing it's geared toward little kids since I found it very boring and petty. It is also difficult to understand what to do next, and I gave up near the beginning. I didn't have a manual because I bought it used, but I did not enjoy this game. Good luck to you! (Just because I didn't like it doesn't mean you won't!)"
2,A game for another grandchild.,This game was a gift for my 11 year old Granddaughter. I guess she is having a rollicking good time playing the game. I have not spoken to her since Christmas so I have no real idea what her level of enjoyment has been.
1,sooooo boring,"This is my first (and last) Animal Crossing game. I was browsing games to get for my new DS when I happened upon this one and thought it was something great due to all the good reviews. But I have to say this is the most boring game I have ever seen. There is absolutely no purpose what so ever, you just walk around talking to people, horrible. They could have at least thrown in a few puzzles."
3,MAD,unless theyre gonna come out with it 4 gamecube later im mad i want it for christmas and as far as i can see they only have it for DS i loved the original but it got boring because i did like almost absolutley everything you could do!
3,ok I dont own this yet but.....,if what the other reviewer said was true that all the holidays have been taken out then mabe they are going to make a new one that has the holidays and that will be the gig to make everyone buy it and even if this is not as good as the other ones i am still going to buy it anyway I dont care it will still be asome (i know that is spelt wrong )you should still get this game for ds unless you have another gaming device that will work on it
1,A Disapointment,"When I got this ""game"" I cried. I expected great things to come out of this game, having loved the first game, but all I got was Animal Crossing with some Online advantages. This game is A TOTAL RIPOFF of the first game! They even DESTROYED the holidays! Christmas, Thanksgiving? All wiped off the face of the planet. And New Year's Day? Pathetic! This game also comes with a caf'e and an observatory, which aren't all that anyway. When I see games like this I want to yell, ""Why, Nintendo!!!"" ):----------- (Author unknown due to his not wanting to be killed by an angry mob)PS. I am actually a huge Animal Crossing fan. I rated the last game a five out of five! (Which is rare)"
1,let me see,for me the game is o.k but i like the old kind of aminal crossing for you like games that happen over and over again then this game is for you but i would say thes two games1.nintendogs2.old aminal crossingare a bit better then brooooooooooooing new aminal croossing.harvest girl pro
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this game is boring. I waited for months and nothing happen. the old animal crossing is better.
4,Animal Crossing on the go. Nuff' Said,"Everything about the original Animal Crossing on the Gamecube has been transfered to the DS version, and even changed up a bit. You can look of it as an expansion around the original game. It adds a few things, but keeps its original concept alive. WiFi also adds a whole bunch the Gamecube version needed so desperately. The only thing that keeps it from being a 5, is that it can get extremely repetitive. I don't suggest playing a whole bunch every day, as you'll quickly grow bored. Just pick it up every couple of days and tend to that town you so desperately love."
5,Animal Crossing/Wild World? FUN!,"When I first got this game it didn't seem that fun but then I found out how to earn money by selling things to Tom Nook. As the game goes on more people arrive in your town and Tom Nooks shop expands, when you pay off your mortgage you get an expansion on your house. You can have up to five players in your house but you get the option of deleting them if you don't like them. I absolutely love this game and play on it everyday. If you get this game and you don't really like it, wait awhile and sell things to Tom Nook. This game is for people who like the idea of earning money to buys things and also writing letters to people in your town. One thing I cna't work out in this game is how for the first few days the mayor is always there then he isn't anywhere and how the mayor said to go to the town hall when there are big events but he isn't there.......confusing!"
5,I really enjoy this fun game.,Good things:The game is very interactive and has new and exciting activities daily!Bad things:The game requires much time spent on it and can take a while to save.
4,Animal Crossing,"This game is definitely fun. It's nice to explore all the little intricacies in a nonlinear fashion, and I'm similarly enthralled by the changing seasons and the way all the gameplay is in ""real time"".The only negative is that the very loose gameplay can get a bit repetitive. On the other hand, it can be equally addicting.A great game with tons of replay value, especially if you take some time off to avoid burnout."
3,"Not for me, but interesting","As you probably already know, Animal Crossing is one of Nintendo's many ""un-games"". There's no score, no competition, and not much objective. You live in a little town, make friends, catch fish, design clothes, hang out... And live, basically. It's scarily addictive, especially since the events in town are connected to your system clock, so something different is happening every day. Me, I found it addictive without being fun---I was logging in daily to see what was happening and catch fish and dig for gyroids... but was never really enjoying it. But I can understand how other people would find it fun, especially if they're into the various customization options, like designing clothes and flags, making a town anthem, and so on."
5,The Best DS Game Ever!!!!,"Animal Crossing wins the battle of best DS game. Animal Crossing allows you to fill your night time skies with your own constelltions. You can drop right in to Brewster's bar for a sip of his hot, marvous coffe. There are two kind,hardworking, ducks who work at town hall. Pelly, takes the day shift, while Phillis takes the night. Pelly and Phillis help the mayor manage the town. Phillis hates working and she shows it with her smart cracks and thoughs. During, a holiday or special event the mayor will stand by town hall.K.K. Slider is a solo musican who plays his guitar in the bar of the muesam. K.K. will give you a free song to bust into your tape player (which you recieve when you move in). Those are only some of the great things Animal Crossing shares but I will leave you to discover those things by yourself. I highly recomend this.THE END!!"
4,My relaxing lunchtime diversion,"Although this game is simple and cutesy it has a gentle charm to it. I never spend more than 10-15 minutes at a time playing it but have found myself still playing it after several months. It's nice to finish off my lunch hour with 10 minutes fishing, pulling weeds, etc. Also the DS Lite battery seems to live forever if this is your primary game."
5,i just love this game!,"Go to the store and buy this game it is soooo fun! you can go fishing,bug catching,and lots more! if you ever see a fish with something on its back catch it because my brother did and it was a hammer head shark for 8000 bells! and in this time of year there are lots of cicada's i always hear them! i think the funnest thing is to go fishing for some reason. but there are lots and lots of fun things to do so go in your car and buy it!"
1,"Bad game, too much hype","A friend of minte told me this game was awesome, and so worth it. I go on here, and it seems all the reviewers believe the same. I get the game (mistake #1). I play it for and hour, then it gets boring. It's already repetitive. This game just isn't worth a cent of it's cost. And, I can't sell the game anywhere for as much as I payed for it. This game sucks, don't get it, if you like even the TEENIEST little bit of fun, this game isn't for you."
2,Not worth the money,"I was a huge fan of the Game Cube version. I was so excited to see the DS version come out so I went out and bought the DS. Boy was I sorry. All the hype about the Wi-Fi connection is really poor. After not being able to connect to my computer with the wireless DSL connection, I sent for the Nintendo USB Wi-Fi connector. Don't waste your money on that either. It still didn't work. I called the nintendo people and they had no clue why it didn't work for me. So I am out the price of the DS, the game and the USB Connector. I only wish I hadn't listened to the reviews that came out. I would tell you to try the cheaper Game Cube game. That is well worth the money at only under $20.00."
2,"swish, the end of ellsd","once again, time is running out, do not hesitate now!. go out ___----____----:::"" and do your best. everyone can use a bit of help now and then, and only you have enough raw talent to do so. stick to it. Confidence: a must have. you can sell it if you have too much. anything goes when you are around those you love. can you stand up to the challenge? ""pride and joy of all, one must rest to regain strength and dexterity"" Anthrotinus once said. do not let the thoughts of others get in your way!"
3,The game was not for me!,This was bought for a grand daughter. She loves the game. So I guess we can say it is a fun game for a child of9 years old.
2,A second play brings disappointment.,"I played this game about six years ago. It was good then. Since then I've played the newer version on the Wii. After playing the newer version then going back to this one, I found myself horribly disappointed. The controls are weak, the fishing is just plain bad, and the game itself is just sad. I've played all of the Animal Crossing titles. I've enjoyed all of them in there own time, but after playing City Folk, there really is no going back to Wild World. I honestly think that the original version would look better than Wild World. It's been a severe disappointment."
5,Best Game Ever,"Animal Crossing: Wild World, is the absolute best game for the DS' if you own a DS' I would highly recommend you to get this game for the fun of it.With this game you could: meet new people, explore different worlds, and play till your hearts desire! ^_^"
4,My daughter loves this game!,"I purchased this game for my 9-year-old daughter and she really loves it. She likes when new neighbors come to her neighborhood. She likes to go to Brewster's and get coffee and then go to Able Sister's and design her own clothes. She found Phyllis to be rude; she's at the post office. Pelly is very nice, though.With this game you make money by catching fish and selling them, shaking the trees and picking up the fruit, and picking up sea shells. You can also catch butterflies with a net and donate them to the museum as well as digging up fossils. You also can write letters to your neighbors and send them presents.I would recommend this game."
5,Simple to play - highly addictive,"Based on many of the other reviews here, I bought 2 copies of this game - one for me and one for my 21-year-old daughter. I wasn't sure she'd like it, and she would never have bought it for herself, but both of us love it. She plays it nearly every day. I try, but with my current schedule, I only get to play a couple times a week. I thought we might get bored with just walking around and collecting things, but every time I play, I just want to see if I can find one more thing for the museum or the catalog before I quit. I haven't managed to catch any bugs or avoid the bees or shoot down a balloon, but I've caught a few fish and dug up some fossils. I was frustrated in the beginning, since it took almost 2 weeks for a shovel to become available in the store, but now I can dig to my heart's content. Who knew you could have so much fun digging, picking up shells, shaking trees, and catching fish?!?!"
5,Life Lessons......,"This is an AWESOME game! I had the first game for the Nintendo Gamecube and I loved it! This one is a HUGE improvement! I mean, you can wear hats! Granted, the humongo depts that you have to pay are a little too humongo...This game puts you in a little town, you get to name the town by the way, with neighbors, a city hall, museum, and a couple of stores. With hard work and effort you can be the richest little person in the world! Muhahahahahahaha! Your little animal neighbors, ranging from cows to eagles, will become your friends and help you out in tough times.I highly recommend this game to hardcore gamers, Nintendo fans, and those of you who are frightened to even go in a video game store. Yes, I mean non-gamers.I also highly recommend that if you get this game you get the Player's Guide to go with it. It has some REALLY good tips in it! Muhahahahahahahahaha!"
5,My boys love it!,"I like the aspect of wireless links, being able to play with other players wirelessly. My boys look forward to what they can collect and meeting others in their created ""towns"". They really enjoy the game."
5,One of their favorites!,"Grandson 1 had this video game on his Amazon wish list, which said in all caps ""I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME.."" He does and was excited to get it. We bought it used at around $35,00 -- pricey -- but new was crazy and more than we spend on 1 game. Used was fine, even had the manual and case."
5,great game,"I've had this game for almost a year now and I'm still interested in playing it. It's easy to learn yet has enough substance to keep me playing. I read many reviews before deciding on this game, as I didnt want to waste my money, and the masses were right. It's a must have. It's good for all ages. I'm 38 and my stepdaughter is 12, we both love it and enjoy playing together visiting each others towns."
5,so much fun,"animal crossing teaches kids about life but in a fun way its fun because you can meet animal friends, fish, catch bugs, listen to music, drinck coffee, get a job, buy a house, design clothes, go to your best friends town (if he or she has animal crossing), get your hair done, and much more. this is a fun game i love it"
5,Responsibility made fun,"The interesting thing about ""Animal Crossing: Wild World"" is that it teaches responsibilty. In order to maintain a pleasant town and attract new neighbors, one has to water flowers, talk to neighbors, send mail, etc. daily, sort of like chores. Only funner. Earning money, too, and buying things one wants, or paying off ones mortgage, both take effort but are well worth it. ""Animal Crossing: Wild World"" can be a handful, but it teaches responsibility and is very fun to play."
1,What the?,"I purchased Animal Crossing about a week ago for my eight year old child. Not only did she love it, I thought it was really cool too. What we realized after a few days of playing was that the characters are not only snarky but down right mean. I'm in shock because my daughter was just called stupid and rude for no apparent reason by one of the characters (Gwen). I've been playing the game with her because I'm very cautious about anything my daughter gets into. I noticed that at any given time, all of the characters can be petty, materialistic, rude and mean. How is this game rated E??? I don't get it. This game is not for kids who's parents teach them manors, respect for themselves and respect for others. Now.........I gave this game one star for fun because other than having to deal with the characters, this game ""could"" be really great. My rating of one star for overall is based on the fact that I can not ignore the blatant and hostile tone of this game. I will never reccomend it."
2,Beware the Mole,"My seven year old daughter fell in love with this game. However, when you forget to save correctly when turning the game off, a horrible little mole comes out. It tells my child she is dumb, a punk, and dirt. It got to the point that she would cry if she forgot to save correctly, knowing this horrible little mole would come out. I have no idea why a child's game would include such an unforgiving character. What child hasn't forgotten to save a game correctly. Especially considering every other game on her Nintendo can simply be turned off when she is done. We finally sold this game, not being able to put up with the horrible rants of this little character. I do not recommend this mainly due to this aspect. Otherwise, the game is great. But, it is just so upsetting that this had to be added to a child's game. Beware the nasty mole!"
5,Very addicting,"My friend got the first Animal Crossing on the Gamecube awhile back, and every time I would watch her play it, I would make fun of her for playing what looked like such a boring game. Then I kept seeing ads for the game everywhere, and that it was coming out soon, and she got it for me last week. IT'S SO FUN!!! O_O I was so wrong! It's a very addicting game in which you build friendships with NPC animals and earn money to support your expensive flair for home decorating. Sound weird? Yeah, I thought so too, but it's a very fun game to have, especially on long car trips. Kind of like Nintendogs, the fun just never ends."
3,WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL???!!!,"You fish, you catch bugs, you do stuff that is so uttterly pointless [to me] that I wonder why the game is bought at all.My friend got animal crossing, let me borrow it, and I found it terrible. There is no point to it!Can somebody tell me why in the world it is so popular?![I gave it 3 stars overall because so many people liked it, one star,for fun, because it was a snooze-fest. Sorry, I just didn't enjoy it.]"
5,Awsome,"This game cool! You get to walk around talking to people, helping them, build your house etc. There are three things I dont like though1. Mr. Resseti, there was no need for nintendo to put him in he takes a long time to get through and he is annoying, the only reason hes there is to punish you for turning the power of without saving!2. Weeds, when you dont play for a while your town is weed galore3.It is fun and all, but I feel like I have to play it every day or I'd miss out on somthing or someone will move away, or WEEDS!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"This shoe is very comfortable, while it lasts. I have had these maybe three months and the inside started coming apart and there are holes in the bottom of one shoe, and the other shoe is forming holes. Stay away."
3,IF YOU HAVE PRONLEMS with PEOPLE AND YOURSELF AND GOD,If you're into despair you might like these poems or you might just think theyare boring. I do admire Bernhard as a writer but most of the poems in these two collections are like recycled Trackl or somebody. I like them regardless...
4,Great DS Game!,"This is by far the best DS game I've played. The graphics are the best I've seen on a handheld (barnone). They are better than anything I've seen on the PSP! Movement is smooth and fluid. Aiming is precise with the stylus. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it can get a little cumbersome trying to aim with the stylus and hold the thing while trying to move and fire. You do get used to it after a while, but it's still cumbersome. Regardless, anyone who enjoys shooters will love this game."
2,Ripped Off,"I paid $13 (including s&h) for a GAME DEMO! I was hoping that i was going to get Metroid Prime:Hunters not, Metriod Prime Hunters, First Hunt. This game was a promo item given out with the DS when it was released. The only good thing about this vendor that i have experienced is how fast i got my demo!"
3,Too much searching,"This game is fun but it becomes very repeatitive in the single player mode. The reason is simply because the whole mission is to find ""key locks"" that you must scan using your visor to open the next section and if you cant find them then you'll be running around in circles for a long time. The sound is so-so and the controls are better then I tought and you get used to it soon enough. However quick shooting isn't so great and when you go against rivals, their dificulty will be based on how much jumps it makes because the more an enemy jumps, the harder it is for you to aim with the stylus.I enjoyed the game but there was too much running around trying to find the last lock to go to the next section. This waste of time killed the enjoyment of the game for me. I'm sure the multiplayer is a lot better but if you are looking for a single player game then move on or play the console versions."
2,You'll either love it or hate it,"I got my DS about a week after it came out and it came with a demo of metroid prime hunters. When I played the demo, I was blown away with the great controls and graphics. I didn't know that this was possible on a handheld. Well, I couldn't wait for the game to come out after I played the demo. Finally, it came out about a year and a half later and I picked it up the day it came out. I loved it for a couple of days. Then, I realized that there are only 4 levels in the single player game, and all you do is travel back and forth between them. Well, after I found that out I figured I would give the multiplayer a try. Multiplayer is definately better than single player. You can play online or regular wireless, and there is little lag online. However, the matchups are random unless you have friends that play. If you do, you can make a custom match in a lobby and you can do voice chat. All in all, You should play this game before you buy it to see if you like it."
4,Great game,This was a really fun game...controls were a little harder to get used to. But I had a lot of fun playing it
3,Merely OK,"Pros:It's the best FPS for the DS, so if you like FPSes and own a DS, you should probably buy this game. The multiplayer, whether wireless with friends or NiWifi is fun. Multiplayer with bots works great when you're out of Wifi range or not with friends. Controls work well once you get used to it.Cons:Best FPS on the DS doesn't say much. Horrible gameplay/graphics/sound/replay compared to console/PC FPSes. Terrible level design with few brightspots peppered in places. Not fun playing against people who've had this game for a long time."
2,"Too Stoned, Too Bad!",Tommy is too stoned to perform! The band is really pulling it out of their A** to accomodate him and cover for his state. Tommy never hits the moment. Hey! All the pros have their bad nights. This is a far cry from the incredible Ebbets Field Live of 1974. Leave this one alone!
4,Good Spanish pop,"After spending many hours commuting in Mexico City traffic while ""Emergencia de Amor"" and ""Mi Respuesta"" played constantly on the local top 40 stations, these catchy tunes eventually got to me and I bought the album. It's not musically interesting or innovative, but these are solid pop songs that will have you humming along in no time."
2,Mi Respuesta,This cd is a change from previous music from this artist. I must say her previous work was catchy and there were muscial hooks that really stuck out. This new release seems to be a cross with M. Carey and such. More blues and the like and it seems contrived-without any passion or phrasing like her previous work. It almost sounded american. I hope her future work is better.
2,CHANGE ISN'T ALWAYS GOOD,"I JUST FINSIH LISTNING TO THE NEW LAURAS PAUSINI CD. AND CHANGE IS NOT ALWAYS GOOD.THIS NEW ALBUM IS R&B(ISH)NOT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FORM LAURA.SHE HAS HIRED NEW PRODUCERS WITCH IN TURN HAVE CHANGE THE STYLE YOU ARE USE TOO.I DO WANT TO SAY I LIKE TRAK ONE ALOT,BUT FROM THERE ON THERES NOT MUCH TO RAVE ABOUT.I HOPE YOU BUY THE CD AND FORM YOUR OWN OPPION OF IT AFTER ALL SHE STILL HAS A GREAT VOICE."
5,"The best C.D. in all class. ""Looking for an Angel"", A+","This is the most diversed album that Laura has ever introduced in the market and the best! She has included romance, pop and a top notch english song produced and arranged by Phil Collins-What a Duo! My favorite, ""Como Una Danza"", it's an extroadinary composition that will take you away!"
3,nice looking but cheaply made,"The purse looks great, but some stitching has already come unraveled less than 3 months after I bought it. Also, the leather is very thin and in a couple spots has already worn through to the padding underneath."
5,Extremely realistic plot,This is a sensational book about kidnapping a bus full of disabled school children. All the children will be killed in 38 hours if the demands are not met. I liked this book as the author isn't afraid to let his villain be evil in the fact that he kills a child during the bus hijacking lets the reader know this isn't going to be a soppy Disney type book where the hero saves all and no one is hurt.No this book is a true thriller where you know the clock is counting down for the main hero character a female detective who must work out where the children are and what the kidnapper is really after.This is an extremely realistic well written book. This could easily happen in the non fiction world which is why you won't be able to put this book down.
4,A great book to read when there is no Literature around.,"I read this book whilst on holiday in the United States, and it took me less than two days to read it. I couldn't put it down.I had read before this book, titles such as 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and 'Catch-22', and even 'The English Patient'. The change of style, tone, plot and storyline, really shows what defines literature, but I'm not saying this is a bad book. On the contrary, it is one of the most entertaining books I have read, and a good read if you are the type who likes the action, adventure and suspense. Good work Zachary Alan Fox, what is your next book called ? I'd be glad to read it."
4,There's nothing like a good villain,"The sociopath has become increasingly popular after Thomas Harris introduced us to Hannibal Lecter in his two seminal novels; The Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon. Yet creating a good and believable character that is truly outside of the accepted limits of society remains a hard task.Zachary Fox pulls it off with Lowell DeVries in All Fall Down.He is such an interesting character that you actually find yourself rooting for him, although he is a complete and utter monster. And as we all know, it's really the villains that make a yarn such as this fun. The good guys are destined to win, of course, so let's make the obstacle course a hard one.Fox does this in All Fall Down which is one of the better thrillers to come along this year. Don't begin reading it unless you're prepared to spend the night finishing it."
1,"Classic recording, lousy transfer","I owned this on cassette and thought I'd replace it with a better quality CD. Boy, was I wrong. The sound here is so poor that it makes the CD almost unlistenable. It sounds like the CD was made from the studio track that included bass and piano only. Sonny sounds like he is in another room, and it's really just awful. I think the original release was on Riverside, so look for that instead. This is a travesty, and not worth the price, if you can believe that!"
1,Cheap stroller,"This stroller is very short and very flimsy! The wheels get stuck easily, because they do not stay straight. They go sideways and pivot w/o warning. Not at all what I expected!!!"
2,"Not sturdy, can break easily","This is a cute product but not very sturdy, a screw came out of the middle cross bar only a couple weeks after we got it. Which is a shame because it was a favorite toy for my daughters."
2,Cheap and flimsy,"I think the title says it all. These are little better than toys, and I do not expect them to last more than one or two uses."
3,Bought for Senior Citizens,I planned to use these for a poetry expression workshop with mostly disabled/developmentally delayed Seniors -- the stamps proved to be too difficult for them to handle. I do not think young children would benefit from their either; I would stick to middle school/high school.
3,Win at Chess,Could be better written to help one starting the adventure of learning chess procedures. Would recommend that a buyer look further.
2,Yet another 'fish coffee table book',"I stumbled over (literally) this book at a fish store a few months ago. At a glance I saw fabulous pictures, all set on black, with lots of text to accompany each species. That was then.Last week I received my own copy of the book. While each species is well represented by picture, the accompanying text is 1) spelled out in 4 languages on each page (reducing the sheer quantity of text information fourfold), and 2) is generally unrelated blabber. For example, one such blurb reads ""No two cichlids are ever identical. Coloration varies somewhat from individual to individual..."" I was hoping for a little more useful information about the species' behavior, feeding, breeding, etc.Still, it makes a nice coffee table book."
3,Nice book but pictures may be misleading.,"This is a nice ""extra book"" for the cichlid hobbyist to obtain. The colorful photos are large, two to a page, and some, not enough, interesting information is on each fish. Although the pictures are simply beautiful, they may be misleading to the person new to the hobby or one who has not seen the ""real"" fish. They simply just do not always look as the pictures depict. The color photos may have been manipulated a bit to give it its outstanding presentation and one who buys a fish thinking it will look like Mr. Tepoot's photo may be greatly disappointed. Pictures of fish in their natural environment should also be obtained to suppliment this pricey two volume set. Still, it is a nice book to add to any cichlid library."
3,Good Book,it's equal the volume 1but this book have more information Thanksamazing PhotosGrate informationincredible and new fishes from americaThank
4,A durable tank!,"I have owned this tank for several years now, and let me first mention that the durability on these things is fantastic. It has seen countless 120 rolls pass through it, without any deterioration of any kind including on the plastic parts. Now, there are some trade-offs to using this stainless steel tank that I outline below:PROS- VERY durable- Well made, obviously light-tight- Lid fits on like a glove- Larger opening for easy pouring in/out of chemicalsCONS- Not as easy to use as the plastic counter-parts- Inner clip is poorly designed, I mostly ignore it.I would not suggest this tank for the total beginner - while some would disagree and tell the budding developer to get over it, I have seen several people give up on home developing because they found this just too difficult to use in the dark. It takes some practice, but once you get it, it becomes muscle memory. If you have already used the metal tanks, or are looking for something more durable, this is an EXCELLENT choice."
5,Great Product!,I just finished using this product on my son's hair. He has very thick black hair and wanted it pink for a breast cancer awareness walk. I was told the only way to get his hair pink was to bleach it and then dye it but I thought I'd give this product a shot. I thought the end result would be a pink tint to his hair but nothing like what the results actually were. His hair is REALLY pink right now. You would never know his hair was jet black an hour ago. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that wants pink hair!
1,Did not work for me (Dyed Black Hair),"I did not purchase this item via Amazon, I went to my local Sally Beauty supply store. I got home, mixed it up according to the instructions and applied it to my hair. Sense the directions said to keep heat on it while it develops I took my hair dryer as suggested and for the 30 minutes that I kept it in I ran that dryer over my head. I got into the shower and was totally mortified..as I rinsed the stuff out of my hair it stained (literally) my shower pink, I never had that happen before and I've been dying my hair for years so it was a shock to me...=/ (Thank goodness for bleach and an hour sitting time, my shower is almost back to white), got out of the pink shower and after all that work, nothing.Just wanted to give you guys a heads up, so you don't waste time and money and have the same results...none."
2,not much pink,"I got this because it had the bleach and dye in it and it looked like a nice pink. After using it, keeping it on for over an hour because I have dark brown hair, my hair was bleached but barely pink. I liked it but it wasn't what I wanted."
5,Worked for me,"For comparison purposes, I have pretty dark brown hair, and I used the pink N'rage color.I followed the directions, and it worked perfectly for me. I foiled, heated and ended up with perfect results. It lasted maybe a week and a half before it got pretty faded. Since my hair was already bleached from this, I've just been re-dyeing it with Manic Panic's pink.In a couple weeks I'll buy another box just to fix the roots, and then continue with Manic Panic.Good luck!"
5,"Cant stop listening,",The only problem is this disc ends. The energy is unmatched. There is more music from these shows not on this disc that is a must have also.
1,I just don't get it,"Either I am really missing the point or I have too much music education, because I just don't understand why Bolin is so highly regarded. This CD is a prime example of Bolin's typical boring, cliched, pablum. There are so many other musicians who say more with one note than Bolin ever said in his entire career.I have listened to a lot of Bolin's music, trying to find something of interest. The only CD that comes close is Spectrum by Billy Cobham; however none of the others that I have, including James Gang, Deep Purple, Alphonse Mouzon (talk about boring!), and various solo efforts, ever get played.Don't waste your time on this overrated drug addict; spend your time much more profitably with Jeff Beck, Holdsworth, Steve Morse, Eric Johnson, Beethoven, Mozart, Coltrane, or many others of similar calibre. Bolin just doesn't measure up."
2,Not for Children,"This book is very appealing to all ages because of the beautiful photographs. My 6 yr old daughter says it is her favorite cookbook for that reason alone. However, we have never actually made any of the recipes in it, and we cook together all the time. There is nothing ""quick"" about cream puffs or BBQ spare ribs, and there is nothing ""easy"" about Baked Alaska,or barbecuing vegetables. None of the recipes that involve pan frying give a temperature for the heat! The directions appear to be step by step, but they really aren't. Actual directions for Lemony Fish Sticks, step 2: ""Beat the eggs. Put the eggs and bread crumbs into two separate shallow bowls. Cut the fish into stick shapes."" I don't know any kid that would eat hot dogs with salsa, as well as most of these very adult recipes. I know this book isn't targeted for 6 year olds, but I would say the actual users of this cookbook are much more experienced than a 9-12 yr old."
1,I BOUGHT THISCOOKBOOK FOR MY 10 YEAR OLD GRANDAUGTER,"Let's take a survey on how many kids would make ""MINTY PEA SOUP"" OR MAYBE ""CARROT & ORANGE SOUP""? HOW ABOUT ""TURKISH MEAT BALLS"" NOW ON TO ""TABBOULEH"" OH THEN THERE'S ""SALADE NICOISE"" Every kid's favorite!!I'lL end it with ""Thai Kebobs with Satay Sauce""This is the WORST CHILDRENS COOKBOOK EVER!! DO WASTE YOUR MONEY!!YOU DON'T EVEN SEE A CHILD IN ANY OF THE PICTURES COOKING!!"
3,Great photos but complicated,This book has great photos of the completed recipes and photos of about 4 steps of the recipe. I got this to use with non-readers so it's not as great as I was hoping--you can't just follow the pictures to make the items. Also this is not stuff you would typically let your kids make--there's a lot of complicated recipes like Baked Alaska and cream puffs.
5,The Reason Why I Cook Today,"I am an 18 year old girl who first got this book about 10 years ago. I recently bought it again because my parents gave it away without telling me. The recipes in this book are so fun and innovative that they made me find my love for cooking at such a young age. Now I cook dinner every night. Parents: if you want your kids to get involved in cooking actual meals, buy them this book! You won't regret it! And to those who say that the recipes are too complex for kids, they aren't giving their children enough credit. Your kids are probably smarter than you. So get this book and open your children's eyes to the wonderful world of cooking."
4,"Yummy recipes, great photos",This cookbook has a lot of fun and easy recipes for kids. It also has great photos and step-by-step instructions. Many appealing recipes for children and adults.
4,Very Thorough Beginner Pilates Workout - Nice Environment!,"I love that this Pilates video is filmed outside near the ocean. Juliana Afram leads you through a one-on-one basic Pilates session where she carefully explains the positioning of your body during each of the movements. She gives you time to change positions and explains the benefits of each exercise. The music is nice and appropriate for the calming environment. My only criticism is on the video shooting. Juliana's skin tones were not captured properly and during a few of the shots, her face and legs are two completely different skin tones. I recommend this dvd if you are a beginner to Pilates and want a thorough, calming introduction led by a professional."
2,Interesting book,"This is a book with a lot of information, but I think there should eb a rearrangement of the information. A bit to much non information too."
2,Not for beginning collectors,"This reviewer is new to the world of collecting military firearms and wanted to educate himself--especially regarding german mausers. Admittedly, this reviewer did not know the difference between a ""byf"" or a ""dou"" marking, or even where they might appear on the rifle. Unfortunately, this book is geared more towards experienced collectors, especially those who collect other than german mausers, and not novices. A picture (of which there are none) showing such basics as where the markings are located would have spoke a thousand words."
2,Not what I expected at all,"This book contains much information I fear was included to justify a second edition, such as discussions of Thai and Islamic calendars, but fails to include a single photo of a rifle to illustrate where and how a marking might be found on a rifle. This is no book for a beginner looking for information on his rifle, but might assist a serious collector seeking marginal data."
3,A short booklet with some original views,"This short booklet was written from a very original view point and is much cited by other authors during the eighties and nineties. Although short, it has some nice exercies that may be worth practising.As far as technical content is concerned, like many books of its time, there is much misinformation about quartz and various references to other minerals that could have been solved by simple mineralogical research. The language is easy to understand, and a glossary is included to define each concept that Lavendar/Criswell has included.If nothing else, it is a fun addition to the library in order to see the primary resource that has influenced at least half a dozen others."
2,"Ill organized, little content","I wanted this book to be a great book. It's small, but high-priced as I paid $32 list for it at the book store. If you are a certified financial planner then you may need to bump my 2 ranking to 3 or 4.There's just a bunch of disconnected stories with several major points on how to network by doing favors for others. This topic is important and I have no doubt the authors do well with it. But the book needs serious editing.The printing is neat, the pages appear formatted well. But the paragraphs must have been shaken and not stirred. There seems to be little connection from one paragraph to the other.John DunbarSugar Land, TX"
2,A great story poorly written.,"Ms. Sirota Gordon has a facinating tale to tell but, ultimately, its telling has little depth and skims the surface of events in her life. Her story deserves another author."
1,Completely Appalled o.O,"I had to read this horrible book in college, and now I see it's selling for hundreds, even thousands of dollars??? Have these people actually *read* this book? It was one of the most self-indulgent ego trips I have ever suffered through! So you can save yourself hundreds of dollars on this story, let's sum it up for you. She was better at everything than everyone else and how dare people not listen to her when she told them something. There ya go. Now use that money to buy something that's actually worth reading."
5,"Another voice saying ""re-print"" this!","I also came here from the NY Times article, and now I want to read the whole story. When copies are listed for hundreds of dollars, you'd think that would tell somebody it's time to go Kindle on this."
3,"upbeat, trippy, but sometimes samey. pleasant elect. music","cool sounds, nice beats, sort of drum and bass. a bit trancey. but the disc on the whole seems too homogeneous for my tastes. the songs upon close inspection are all quite different, but when you listen to the whole package at once, at the end you're under the impression it's all sort of samey."
5,Sweet Baby James,"When I bought this album in 1969, I had no idea who James Taylor was. I was flipping through new releases and the cover caught my eye. I have pretty good intuition and I felt this album was something special. So I bought it...and loved it immediately. And I still love James Taylor. I bought the CD when it was first available. This is a must have for any JT fan...the genius at the beginning of his professionl career. He his an American Treasure."
5,Wonderful.,"i absolutely adore this album, which i guess makes it a little hard to be objective...but trust me, it's great--pure, classic, sweet JT. does it get any better? i don't think so :)"
5,Landmark Album from James Taylor,"I recently bought the Sweet Baby James CD and was disappointed at the audio quality. There is a lot of background hiss, which by 2010 is something that calls for a remastering to correct.But the songs are perfect. James was never better, each song hits it on the mark, whether is a fast rocker like Steamroller, soft ballad like Blossom or a heartfelt song like Fire and Rain, which was a huge hit for him, and most likely helped drive album sales then."
5,One of the first popular music records I ever listened to,"I'm a 23 year old musician who is interested in all styles of music.. I was raised in a family where music has revolved around my life forever... my parents are classical musicians and they bought this album for me when I was either 4 or 5 years old and listened to it consistently for a number of years in circulation with Handel's Concerti Grossi Op. 6, Simon and Garfunkel's Bookends and 3am, some Cat Steven's thrown in here and there... James Taylor struck such a big chord with me that I tried writing him a fan letter when I was 6 years old... it never got to him.. it was returned to me... I was living in NYC where I was born and raised and we thought that he lived somewhere on Central Park West... enough about my story but this album is one of the major influences of my life.. I have nothing new to add here... it's a blessing"
3,Sweet Baby James Review,I am really not a James Taylor fan but was recommended by a close friend to purchase this CD.I found this cd to be very enjoyable listening relaxing.
5,yay,"smooth, cool and sweet. This was one of my mom's favorite records when she was young, and now it's one of mine. I think people quickly form a sentimental attachment to this album. It's tinged with a soulful, hopeless romantic quality. A very comforting and intimate listening experience."
4,If you like grungy Blur this is for you!,"If you loved the grunge on ""Blur"" but were a little aprehensive about their earlier releases, then you will love ""Live from Budokan."" Songs that were very pop-ish (i.e. ""Tracy Jacks"" and ""Mr. Robinson's Quango"") take a harder turn with this rough live set. Don't get me wrong, Blur pays tribute to its pop past on ""Budokan"" but you can definitly see where the ""Blur"" album came from. Although it is a little pricey, I recommend it for any hardcore Blur fan."
4,"One of the best ""Line Of Duty"" movies",The true story of an attempt by the FBI to capture a pair of extremely dangerous bank robbers that lead to the death of two special agents. The shootout that really occured has become almost a textbook story for law enforcement agencies. A must see for anyone interested in law enforcement or the FBI.
4,"POWERFULL, SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT....","NOW THIS IS A MOVIE YOU DON`T SEE EVERYDAY...IT IS VERY POWERFULL MOVIE, AND SOMEWHERE, I THINK IT SENDS A MESSAGE...ABOUT GUNS !!! F.B.I. HAS A VERY HARD TIME, IN THIS MOVIE, TO TRACK DOWN TWO KILLERS WHO, BASICALLY, KILL FOR FUN. IF YOU WANNA WATCH THIS MOVIE GET READY FOR SOME ACTION.THE END OF THE MOVIE, IS NOT YOUR EVERYDAY, HAPPY ENDING MOVIE...VERY TOUCHY..."
1,Not much here,"I agree with the reviewer from Peterborough, not much here. 2.0 only mix. The same content as the original video released in the 1990s. On top of that no booket, no information on where the concert was recorded (it was actually from 2 locations if you have the CD of the same name). I was hoping for a few additional tracks. Only thing good was that the price was low enough!"
4,If Mark didn't mumble...,Great music! Good lighting! If you don't know the words to the songs get the lyrics or be prepared to strain your ears trying to understand Mr. Knopfler's vocalizations. I was disappointed at so much material being cut out because I'm sure this concert was longer than this DVD.
2,Rather than waste your time with this...,"The real must-see Dire Straits concert video is ""Alchemy,"" a film of a 1978 show where the group is at their very zenith. It is fantastic, Hall of Fame stuff. ""On the Night"" is a sorry 15-years-later fake reunion (with only the original bassist returning to join Knopfler)along with a dozen mediocre session players cashing in on a giant stadium tour. The renditions are competent, and Mark always has his array of impressive licks, but it's just going through the motions here (although admittedly there's a bit of fire to the version of ""Brothers In Arms""). I saw this tour when it came to the U.S. and was somewhat disappointed, but to see it in close-up now confirms my ""they're only in it for the money"" suspicions. The off-the-chart audience reactions seem to be photo-shopped from some much better show. If you're a die-hard Dire Straits fan, stick with ""Alchemy"" and you won't be sorry. They were a phenonmenal group then."
3,"Good, but not as good as could be","Video good. Audio good, but 1) 5.1 would have been better and 2) lead singer's voice was muffled and words almost impossible to understand - almost like a foreign language. Missing many of the hits I'd like to have heard."
3,Dire Starts on the the night Live --Great,"That a great Live for Dires Starts in this DVD. Basically this DVD Live their songs is quite good on the arrangement. But only one thing that there are not include my favour songs wtth ""Why worry"" & ""So Far away""."
4,Dire Straits - Great Show!!!,"This is a great show! I give it 4 stars because I want to see the show in its entirety released. I know they were promoting their current album on this tour, but I know for a fact that many songs were left off of this DVD, and since this is the last tour Dire Straits did, it would make sense to release a DVD with every song performed."
4,"Good concert, DVD is good but could be better","This DVD doesn't contain many songs, but what it does have are some of Dire Straits' hits from albums such as On Every Street, Brothers In Arms, and others. It's great to watch Dire Straits play these songs. Mark Knopfler's guitar playing is great as always, as is his unique voice and singing. The vocal harmonies on some of the songs (i.e. Walk Of Life) sound excellent.The downside to this DVD is that it only has stereo audio (no surround mix), and the video is in the 1.33 aspect ratio (square, not wide screen). There are also no extras, and the DVD doesn't come with any notes or anything. This is why I only give it 4 stars; however, this is a great concert overall. One nice thing about the DVD is that it is region-free. I would recommend this for any Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler fan."
3,"Beautiful piano technique, journeyman conducting, dull audio.","I have always enjoyed Michelangeli's beautiful technique more than any of his interpretive insights. His technique requires good quality audio to be appreciated fully. These pieces were recorded live in 1951; the sound lacks clarity, and the volume rolls off substantially at both ends of the audio spectrum. The orchestra's skill and Giulini's conducting are competent - but nothing more.Your satisfaction when the recording is over will be the inverse of your expectations going in. If you had no particular expectations, you will be satisfied; if you thought ""Great! Michelangeli, Giulini and Mozart!"", you will be disappointed."
4,A very good guide to using juice for detoxification,"This is an excellent book to follow to do what people call juice fasting. I won't get into the language argument of using the term fasting with juicing because everyone knows what you mean. What the good Dr. has here is an excellent way for an individual to gain control of their health. As a by product you will effortless lose weight and detoxify at the same time. I can't stress the detox benefits enough as you will simply be amazed at what happens to your body as you continuously use the program. Even if you do it once or twice a year, once a week or whatever you will always realize benefits. The program is so very flexible and you shouldn't be bored. The first few times I followed the book to the letter of the law and then I re-read it and found that there were alternatives given that I had glossed over. These alternatives make this a very flexible and easy to do routine. This is the no excuse way of keeping yourself healthy."
1,NO content Sent with Kindle Book ONLY cover IMAGE Help pages run in circles,"How do I get help with digital content? Help links run in circles re: Kindle. Have had help with MP3, but I have no content for this book. Only cover image. Resend does Not Work."
3,Small book,"Not too bad. but I was expecting something more informative. The book is very small and honestly, who can afford during juice fast rest in a bed 3 hours a day?"
4,It actually motivates me to close my mouth,"This book touts the many health benefits of juice fasting, not just weight loss. I found it fascinating and am about to embark on my first fasting experience because of it."
2,Not worth the price,"I got from the library the 7 day cleanse before going through this book. I thought I was paying for the best book written ever on juice fasting. It's a good book I would have enjoyed more had I paid $10.00 for it. I already had this information from the book I mentioned above but that book actually holds your hand and walks you through with all the nitty gritty details. Once again very good basic information but there is no ""How to"" for a first timers opinion."
5,MADONNA the American Life album is awsome !,Go girl < MADONNA the queen is back with a new cd and its awsome ! go Miss M.
2,Interesting artist and topic - horrible song musically,"If anyone other than Madonna had recorded this song it would have been dubbed one of the worst songs ever. The lyrics are interesting and I can understand why she wanted to release a song about this topic - but BLAH - the music is AWFUL! I like Madonna, she great, I have all of her albums and many of her singles - but this one stinks. I like some of the other songs on the album of the same name, it's worth your time and money, but this single isn't. The song is just all wrong - it doesn't flow, it's all over the place, trying to decide what it wants to become and never quite discovering it. I can listen to it, it's not horribly painful like some other bad songs - but I rarely do by choice. One of Madonna's worst works. This single is only for DIE HARD fans."
2,Boring life,"this is the worst record by Madonna,period. I tried to listened to this album and found myself pushing the skip button a lot. Ive always enjoyed her music because its danceable and fun,enjoyed most of her 80's records and found Bedtime Stories one of her best in the 90's. If you want a smart dance pop album with catchy tunes get Kyle Minogue's ''Fever'' or Lisa Stansfield's brilliant ''Biography'' and skip this new album by Madonna,save the dissapointment and your money."
2,Madonna regresses.....,"as an avid fan of madonna, i eagerly purchased ""american life"". i was expecting to find the same originality she poured into ""ray of light"" and ""music"". while there are a couple good songs (namely ""hollywood"") the rest of it is madonna ripping off of the previously named albums...but not for the best. while each of the latter two discs had their own flavor to it, this one had none. to make matters worse, madonna seems to be regressing in her abilitiy to make innovative lyrics. in most songs she complains, moans, and complains some more. in the song ""nobody knows me"", she declares that ..well...nobody knows her. wow. should we feel sorry for her with all her millions and fame? or should we classify her now into the gansta rap category- a.k.a. hard knock life/feel sorry for me even though i get money, cash, hoes everyday. get back to being original, madonna. ..i still have faith."
3,Stupider than stupid.,"This is Madonna's least interesting album since just about ever, if you don't count soundtrack tie-ins as ""real"" albums. It's not bad, it's just not all that good. I guess some people agreed with me, because it's the first Madonna album not to feature a major hit single. Anyway, this album was a disappointment for me. Madonna can do much better than this, and I'm sure she will in the future."
2,Very Average,"There's nothing too redeemable on this record, except that she gives the word 'rap' a whole new meaning. Think it's time to 'wrap' it up. Her dance records weren't too bad in the 80's, but this is just plain boring. And her voice is just 'there.'I think a lot of people have lost interest, and there won't be much ado made with future efforts."
2,Not Great---Just OK,"The album is not too adventurous and is ok to dance too. But it's not easy to stomach the rapping. Madonna has also transformed herself into a Muscleman of late, Physically(Why?), and that's too bad.Grade--C+"
2,ZZZZZZZZZZ,"Everything after Vogue and Express Yourself has been mediocre to positively dull and monotonous. She'll always be a STAR, but it doesn't mean that everything she records is good."
1,makes you nostalgic for Dick Tracy,"I own every Madonna CD and have been a fan since Holiday. This CD is stunningly bad. Her rapping is simply embarassing--I cringe through half this CD. And not that M. ever had a formidable voice, but American Life makes you realize just how thin and unimpressive her pipes really are.I didn't love Die Another Day when it came out with the stinky Bond film of the same title, but it's by far the best song on this CD. Give up the poet laureate act, Midge, and go back to what you do best--fun dance candy. Leave the agonizing and the depth to others.The musical equivalent of Swept Away. Ick."
4,Update,"I was so carried away by the first half of the CD, I posted my last review - some of the songs are kind of weak, and dwell too much on religion.. taking away a star. Again, if you like Madonna in her synth mode, this is a good CD"
1,The reason,Their is a reason you can get this cd used for $2.00. Thats all it is worth!!! How low do you think it will go?
2,Boring and Not Very Original,Madonna never had a very good voice but some of her dance songs were ok. Now with A.L. It's just a bunch of very average songs and a noticeably aging singer trying to stay relevant. The material is mediocre at best. There's a lot better records available by other more relevant artists currently on the scene
1,get an american voice,how is madonna famous? her voice is pittyful...i don't hear any range or high notes...her music is louder than her voice and that just sux i don't know why you guys are wasting your money or her???!!
2,American Life Just Average,"It's not anything special. Modonna can't really sing, but she at least tries her best. This is average musical fare from a now middle aged singer trying to keep up with the hot Britney Spears and Beyonce. 2 stars."
2,What The Hell,"A Few of the tracks like lover profusion, hollywood, and im so stupid take time. Madonna rapping HELL TO THE NO!!!! Hun what are You thinking??? You Were so innovative on other releases. What happened? This ish sucks!!!"
2,Don't Believe The Hype...It's JUNK.,"For the most part I can't stand this disc. The production is choppy to the point of sounding ""junky"", the guitar playing sounds like noodling and the rapping is sophmoric. Madonna needs to: #1 find a therapist to work out her ""issues"" and #2 find a new producer to give her a better sound. People that like this, like it because it's Madonna...not because it's actually any good. She's a great artist that should put out a better piece of work. Definitely a disc you will pull out in 5 years and think ""what the......""! Sounds like a RUSH job to me and she should re-think her direction."
3,Uninspired and bland.,"None of the songs on this album are particularly memorable. In fact, the songs on this album sound as if they are the ones that didn't make it onto Ray of Light. I liked some of the songs on American Life, however, after I listened to it, I popped an entirely different Madonna CD into my CD player: The Immaculate Collection. I wish Madonna would reinvent her sound and stop cultivating this techno sound that she has stuck with for two albums now."
2,UnAmerican Life,"Let's face it , Madonna has made some excellent music in the past. I was a huge fan of both Ray Of Light and Music when they were released. It was some of the best music that she had ever done . When ""Die Another Day"" was released last year , I damaged my subwoofer playing it loudly and often.I had a bad feeling about this album when Madonna pulled the ""American Life"" video for negative imagery involving President Bush and then blathered on about file sharing. I think she pulled the video because of the stupid rapping she does in the song. It's almost embarassing. Although the music is very good , Madonna's performance is not . The lyrics are moody and almost angery . It's not the fun and dance driven lyrics of the other albums. I'm thinking these songs are the dark products that the failure of her film ""Swept Away"" caused . Preview this album before you buy , I think most will hear the difference."
5,the best album this decade,"Somebody has to say it. This album is the most sophisticated album I have bought this decade. No other albums offered musical diversity and the personal vibes that american life did for me. For christmas, buy somebody you know TWO albums: confessions and this one, forget buying mariah carey rereleases of mimi and merry christmas!"
5,It made American History..,"People just ingore the bad remarks,dont even click that you disagree SCREW there opnions. There all bandwagon haters, half of thoses idiots have not even heard the album yet. Madonna's american life has everybody doing what she loves, TALIKING ABOUT IT AND HER. SO get ready america Madonna is going to tour with no need for supporting acts...................................."
2,"Great lyrics, bad music","I love Madonna but was so disappointed in this album. I was the biggest wanna be in my home town and loved her power and energy, but of course her catchy songs kept me hooked and I have followed her career closely ever since. After Ray of Light,I knew that was it. How could she top that musically? This album, although she is more open and trying to reveal her soul to us in American Life, was just unbalanced to me and I really did not feel anything special in it musically. Hollywood is the best song on the album, and the only song remotely danceable is ""Die Another Day"". But, I love her anyway and will always buy her records."
3,not THAT bad,"ok so it's not as cute as ray of light or as cool as Music, but it ain't THAT bad. i enjoyed ""hollywood"" where madonna demonstrates a somewhat shirley manson voice that i didn't think she'd be able to perform, but it's pretty good. and the sounds of ""easy ride"" are quite impressive. the album in general is very minimalistic which means you won't shake your bon-bon listening to it, but i think it does manage to give a certain mood and message. i can see why it's not appealing to madonna fans as such, sounds more like an indie/electro album to me, but i think u should give it a chance. NO artist can perform top-notch all the time but i don't think this is at the bottom, dissapointments are inevitable as everybody has their hopes too high up for a great artist like madonna. ;)"
2,American Life or Lifeless,"The 20 year Queen of pop is much deserved...However, this latest album I was able to get a day early left me feeling that either age, children, or marriage had taken first place over creativity on her part...not that that's a bad thing but, this is Madonna we are talking about! Bring us a cheerful high energy club CD and show them all YOU still got it versus this slow and at times rather folky try to be hip hop try to be whatever CD. Your fans still love you but, you left us empty with this one and craving something for our summer's out having fun...."
4,Suprisingly Good,"Over the past 20 years of Madonna`s career, she`s constantly evolved as an artist. This is her first album in 3 years and it`s suprisingly good. It sounds like she put a lot of effort into it and it sounds almost as good as Ray of Light. She tries a variety of new things on this album such as rap and more techno plus a more in depth look into Madonna the person. The lyrics are well written as well. There are so many good songs on this album that it`s hard to pick a favorite. The only thing I really didn`t like was all the techno beats because it gets annoying after a while."
2,Where is Borderline When You Need It!!!!,"I found this record to drown under the weight of its own pretensions. I know, I know. Madonna needs to continually evolve as a serious and spiritual artist, and is unable to artistically go back to her roots ie. to music people truly enjoyed. As a woman that thrives on being unpredictable, Madonna would be really doing something bold and ""cutting edge"" if she challenged herself to return to the tight linear hooks, and simple concise lyrics that made her famous to begin with. Trust me when I say that 20 years from now, no song from this album will be playing on the radio. But I bet Borderline will be."
3,Mixed feelings.,"I think this album is good, but for some reason, I can't stop thinking about Madonna's older music. I have played that over and over while this CD sort of just sits there and is taken out on occasion."
5,Madonna muses,"I didn't know to expect from this CD, but after listening to it over and over, I am hooked. This is a completely different sounding Madonna - mature, contemplative, perhaps disillusioned. The songs seem to be a sequal to many of her previous songs, such as ""Mother and Father"" is an ode to ""Oh Father"".Its a beautiful CD, and as a long-time fan, who has grown up with Madonna, I appreciate that her songs reflect and grow with us her fans."
2,Disappointed Madonna Fan,"Disappointed is exactly the right word. I am a huge Madonna fan. I've purchased every album as soon as it's come out, going as far back as having ""Like a Virgin"" on vinyl! But this album has disappointed me. The music is fantastic and very similar to that of her last album ""Music"" however the lyrics are lacking. It seems Madonna was more interested in making the end of each line rhyme then filling the lyrics with meaningful content. Sadly, this is the first Madonna album that I'm not recommending."
4,Extremely Under-rated,"With the exception of I'm So Stupid, I thought this album was brillant. It should have garned more media attention then it did, very under-rated but very incredible."
4,Good but not exceptional,"This album is very good. Madonna proves again how she can be exceptional, mutable, different. Unlike most artists, she changes style as she change clothes in the show. She likes to take chances and that's good since artists in general are on the safe side.The lyrics aren't an exemple of literature and certainly won't be recommended at universities or schools. But who cares? The beat is great as well as the rhythm. And that's what really matters. At least, people go to discos and night clubs to dance.Some songs are boring. I'd say the songs are irregular. Few are very good, some are good, others OK and very few are boring (not exactly bad). So the outcome is above the avarage. It's a good album. This CD is very personal and everything is about her, including the title: her American Life. Some people are bothered by her ""selfishness"", but just in case you are one of those people, don't listen to CD. Simple as that."
4,Not her best... but not too bad either!,"Okay, RAY OF LIGHT is probably Madonna's ultimate masterpiece. This new disc, however, doesn't carry over any of the genius from that album. AMERICAN LIFE picks up where 2000's MUSIC left off. I admit, the computer altered vocals are a bit much at times. Overall, though, the cd is pretty good. My faves are 'Love Profusion' 'Easy Ride' and 'Nothing Fails.' I mean, is it really possible for Madonna to create a bad album? I don't think so! The lady has been a megastar for 20 years, and for good reason. The weakest track: 'I'm So Stupid.' The music itself isn't bad, but the lyrics are just plain silly. Personally, I would love to see her work with William Orbit again. Together, they made RAY OF LIGHT one of the best pieces of pop music ever created. Thankfully, the heavy electronica of this album is blended with acoustic guitars, strings, and live percussions. Long live Her Majesty, Madonna!"
2,Disappointing after her last 2 albums...,"I think Madonna's best albums are her first 2 and her last 2 before this one... I had mega expectations for this album after Music, Ray of light, Frozen et al. and was a bit shocked and disappointed when I heard American life for the first time. Some of the traxx are decent - Love Profusion, Hollywood, Mother and Father - but they are a bit too mundane, repetitive and interrupted with raps and inane lyrics that make me cringe and are a bit embarrassing for such an accomplished star. Sometimes a creative mis-step leads to an incredible comeback, which is what I'm hoping. Madonna has a lot of other far better records in her repertoire."
1,This is by far Madonna's worst Album!,"I'm sorry to say that this is the worst album I have ever listened to. I'm a a big fan of Madonna and have been since I was 8 years old. I was very disappointed with this album. The songs are all awful! They all sound the same and have no beat. If I could give it zero stars, I would. Madonna can do better. Save your money."
3,"Madonna can't be faulted, but this isn't her best work.","This cd has some catchy songs, but it is not one of Madonna's best. I bought it because it's Madonna, and you have to buy her cd's, but I didn't like it a whole lot."
1,No Talent Here,"I am a big Madonna fan, and bought the new album before hearing all the tracks. Boy, was I disappointed. This has got to be the worst album she's ever done. She comes off as being preachy in songs like ""American Life"". There also seems to be no soul or feeling in any of the tracks. It seems the days of Like a Prayer (which I consider to be her best) are no more. If this is what the future holds for Madonna's music, then count me out. I'll be happy listening to her good albums like Music, Ray of Light, and Like a Prayer. In her attempt to capture the younger audience of today, she has abandoned the audience that made her popular in the first place. Don't waste your money or your time on this CD. I sure wish I hadn't"
2,Not So Good,"I was extremely disappointed with the lead single, ""American Life, and unfortunately, I'm equally as disappointed with the remainder of the album. ""Nothing Fails"" is a highlight for me, but it's not enough to salvage the album.I'll keep my fingers crossed for some good club remixes."
2,"Madonna, Slow Snooze,","I was hoping to love this CD, Instead I got a Cd of Bleeps andslow musings ala Jewel, On most Madonna Cd's you get a coupleof great pop or dance tunes, here nothing pops out, thisis truly a weak collection, If it was any other artist I wouldgive it a pass, But not Madonna, Madonna where are you?"
2,Can you say Shanghi Surprise or Swept Away....,"I'll tell you upfront Im a Madonna fan but not obsessed by admiring everthing single thing she does just becasue she puts her fingerprint on it. Ray of light was incredibly unique and brilliant - a venture into something new and exciting..I looked forward to this CD, and have now tried listening to it at least 4 times and can never make it past lets say 5 songs before I once again brand it as FILLER from someone who is a much more talented - both vocally and intuitively - she has reinvented herself - unfortunatly as someone churning out whatever she can to make a buck... vocals are weak, sound is obnoxious, and every bit of the album sounds the same.... If you disagree, Im sure you had to own the two movies above..."
3,i was expecting more :-(,i really like the box and the poster but i was expect to see videos in that cd or exclusive songs like confessions and hard candy! :-(
3,Dull,"I believe the main problem with this album is that the lyrics are really dull, perhaps with the exception of 'Easy Ride', 'Die Another Day' and 'Nothing Fails'. One would expect otherwise from 'the new Madonna' who is a 46 year-old mother of two big time Kabbalist who's had an incredible life. Most of the lyrics are just words that rhyme that you would expect from a 12 year old. I believe the aim here was to make a dance record with a message but that was done a zillion times better with 'Ray of Light'. Shortly, great vision, disappointingly executed."
2,Who Needs To Be a Diva Anyway,"OK, Madonna may look much older and not be nearly as pretty as Beyonce Knowles, and a lot of other Divas out there, or sing as well, but she seems happy even though she doesn't make the BB singles charts any longer in America. It's sad that radio stations are ignoring her as well. But so what, right??But, now she's doing music for herself. She doesn't need a zillion fans like Mariah and Beyonce or Britney, to feel important."
5,Can't wait to see her perfoeming AL songs on the tour,"Hey, I'm disappointed, someone said that she isn't gonna perform Love Profusion on the tour.For me Die Another Day is one of her best songs ever, and it's gonna be performed in a tango mood ;-)))))))Can't wait to see her maybe closing the show with easy Ride.The best songs here are Love Profusion, Easy Ride, Nothing Fails, Die Another Day and American Life.The best maxi-single is of course Hollywood, precious remixes."
5,The spell keeps going........,For me this is simply her magic record...I believe it helped me to change my life in so many ways...Songs like American Life and Hollywood made me think more about the world we live in right now...Songs like easy Ride and Nobody Knows Me made me reflect about my relationship with other people...And Nothing Fails and Intervention represent for me my love for my boyfriend...I really love this album.
3,Madonna will always be Madonna,"I have to give her credit where it is due. She has mastered a VERY successful career for herself, and stayed at the top of her game (whether you liked her or not) for many years.This album, in my opinion, is not BAD...it's just OK. And for me, for an album to worthy of listening it needs to be atleast GOOD or GREAT. Most hardcore Madonna fans will most likely drool over this release, despite the poor record sales it has garnered.Madonna seems like she is trying TOO hard to be noticed here, and that act in my opinion is getting quite old. Just be yourself Madonna! People will like you, I promise. And now she's teaming up and making out with Britney Spears? C'mon...She makes out with young girls one day, and the next she slips on a flowery sun dress and tries to sell her Children's Book, what gives?I think Madonna may be going through a mid-life crisis, and it shows on this disappointing album."
5,"Madonna, Need I Say More?","Of course I do. I will admitt, I really didn't know what to think about the album at first listen. But it has definetly grown on me. Hollywood, is an awesome tune and should be the focus single. But American Life sounds great out in the clubs and you can get your groove on. I wouldn't say it is better or worse than any of her other albums. It's just different. She is always doing things different. Her sounds are unique. She is a great entertainer. This album is something I will enjoy for years to come. I definetly recommend it."
2,"Tired, Uninspired and Somewhat Laughable","Has anyone noticed that the photo of Madonna on American Life looks like a cross between Heidi Fleiss and Che Guavara? Tisk tisk missy. Terribly unoriginal cover, though very appropriate for a terribly unoriginal recording."
2,Darn Awful,"No wonder she needs to lip synch in her shows. As it is Madonna cannot sing a note. She never will. It would take a miracle and maybe channeling the great Billie Holiday, in order to make this stinky album sound passable. Madonna's a hasbeen. Get over it- move on to the real talents out there. I'm giving it 2 stars, just because Madonna has the guts to put out another record and punish the public."
1,Not Worth Your Time.,"I can't look at her, let alone listen to her. She's boring, generic and this album proves that she can neither write nor sing. Save your $$$ and check out JLO or Brit's albums. They have great beauty plus talent!!!!"
2,The Times They are a Changin',And man are they ever. madonna was once the in and cool singer way back when. her music has gotten bland and boring since then. American Life is a complete throwaway record.The songs are lifeless and stale. I can put on any Britney or JLO song and hear the exact same thing--only their voices have more personality and range.[...]
2,Madonna's Desperation,"Since Madonna is So Into Making out w/Women shouldn't she have called her latest project, ""American Man.""Lets get real, she's at a desperate time in her life.Maybe she should have that operation she so obviously longs for.It might help her failing career.At least that would be a 'real' reinvention."
1,Modonna's Amer. Life,"I wish I could say better things about this record. I sadly cannot. Madonna tries to be the hip artist like Britney Spears and JLo, among others.Why does she try so hard here???It really sounds forced.Britney and JLo are the new superstars of now.Madonna isn't in the news any longer, or in the same category. Guess it's time to move on."
1,The Old Troll Strikes Out,Can't believe how ugly Madonna has become. Troll city. Her music is just as bad.Norah Jones is classy and madonna is too gross now to even qualify for trailer trash.
1,Madonna sucks,"Actually all pop music sucks especially when its female singers. Madonna ain't even an acception whatsover, quite frankly all her music sucks. She's nothin but an MTV/mainstreem sellout along with Hillary Duff, Avril Lavigne, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Michelle Branch, Jo-Jo, Shakira, Nelly Furtado, Janet Jackson, and Mariah Carey who of course all care about one thing: Money. There's better music out there other than this overrated MTV garbage. Arch Enemy - you damn right, Otep - sure, Lacuna Coil - anytime, Madonna - NEVER!!!!!!!!"
4,Excellent,"The more albums she makes, the better she gets. This is one of her best yet. Her lyrics are very personal and each song is very individual with it's own message. Her guitar playing is just an added bonus to this wonderfully made album. True Madonna fans will greatly appreciate this album!"
2,American Life - So What!,"Two words sum this CD up...NOTHING SPECIAL. Obviously she will never top ""Ray Of Light"" or even ""Like A Prayer"" for that matter. MUSIC was fun...this is just boring now...can you say ""been there, done that"" Madge. There will be no grammy nominations for this one, that's a given!"
1,Pure product; no substance,"Yes, some of the lyrics are introspective, but that doesn't mean they're good. I had high hopes but these songs and their ideas have all been heard before. This is no return to form but more like a sampler or reflections of what's on the radio today by others working harder and better at their craft. None of the songs stay with you. Rudimentary acoustic guitar to hip hop beats does not lead to a 5 star record, especially when the playing ( mostly by Madonna) is so amateur. Sometimes playing safe is not the way to go."
1,A true commercial sellout,"First of all, Madonna can NOT sing. She is only interested in 2 things: Money,and pushing peoples buttons. The songs on this are vapid, empty, and completley lacking any artistic statement whatsoever. The videos for these songs bored me to tears, and she probably only had one thing on her mind when she recorded it: Money. And what is with her image changes. I mean, how many times has she changed her image? Once a Cd? Somethin' like that. This is a pure waste of money."
3,Drones and Strums,Originally I was not sure about this recording of Madonna's. It is composed mainly of electronic drones and M's pattened guitar strums.But it grows on the listener and is a good listen on headphones. Alland all good production and a nice effort.
3,okay>????? and your point madonna>?,"i dont get madonna at all.... she changed from boy toy, material girl, sex siren, controversial star, mother, sophisticated lady, novelist..... then HARD CORE POLITICIAN!!!!!i dont like this madonna at all... she is tryin to reach a point and tell me something but im as confused as ever...the title track 'american life' is just a millenium version of ""we built this city"". this song is alright but then she starts rapping... which sounds okay until she mentions PILATES!!!!! first rule of rappers.... DON""T RAP ABOUT PILATES! PERIOD! the LP goes on into 'hollywood' which i still dont know what she is talkin about but the song is still alright.okay i could get into the album but this album was not all that great... the best songs are 'easy ride', 'die another day', and 'i'm so stupid' (arguebaly the best song on the album because she is so mad in this song).overall, i'd rather her madonna rap about having sex with warren betty then about her luxary life...2.8 stars"
2,I really wanted to like this album,"When I listened to this album, I really wanted to like it. I really did. While it's not quite as weak as Erotica, it comes pretty close. This album focuses heavily on the theme of the excesses of modern life; however, the album has too strong of an emphasis on this theme, making Madonna almost as guilty of excess as those she criticizes.American Life suffers from a lack of diveristy in the music. Also, many of the songs seem to get stuck in a groove and never really progress anywhere musically. The song ""Nobody Knows Me"" felt a lot like a re-hash of ""Impressive Instant"" (from Madonna's previous album, Music).It just felt like Madonna and Mirwais didn't put forth as much effort as they could have when producing this album. When I listened to the disc, I kept having this ""been there, done that"" feeling. When Confessions on a Dance Floor came out, I was very relieved to see Madonna move on from heavily relying on Mirwais as a producer."
3,"Far from her best, but.....","It is still pretty good! As always, Madonna doesn't completely disappoint. ""American Life,"" ""Hollywood"" and ""Die Another Day"" are all very good and even have great lyrics-but sadly, unlike pretty much all of Madonna's albums, there isn't a single track here that really, really grabs you that you can just listen to till the CD wears out (Holiday, Like A Prayer, Into The Groove, Don't Tell Me, Human Nature, The Power Of Goodbye, Ray Of Light, Beautiful Stranger, Erotica, Deeper And Deeper). And the track here that comes closest to becoming a typical Madonna classic is ""Hollywood,"" which is a song you'll likely be humming for a while after you hear it. ""Die Another Day"" is also a quite good, almost haunting, track-listen to the lyrics. But like I said, nothing too fantastic here. Ray Of Light and Music both had a more consistent flow of good music than this. But the hardcore fans should get a little bit of a treat with this."
1,What a Drag...,"Proof that age does in fact bring everyone down at some point. Madonna, sounding like a boring, rich housewife complaining about her wealth, has never sounded so out of touch with reality. The chorus doesn't fit the rest of the song, and it sounds like she took two song ideas and pasted them together to make one song. This approach only proves that some songs are best left on the cutting room floor."
2,An inferior version of 'Music',"Though perhaps not the disaster predicted in some quarters, it is her worst studio album to date.Yes, its even worse than 'Bedtime Stories'.In 'Hollywood', 'American Life' and 'Die Another Day', the albums best tracks, we get Madonna at her most heart-breakingly average.The album is, at best a 5th rate carbon copy of the excellent 'Music' album, something which makes it all the worse. It is one of the only suprises of the record - that, for the first time in her career, she simply regurgitates an old formula.The other rather awful surprise is the cringe inducing rapping on such tracks as 'Mother and Father' - sample lyrics "" My mother died when I was five/And all I did was sit and cry/I cried and cried and cried all day..My father had to go to work/I used to think he was a jerk""Don't waste your money on this. Buy 'Music' instead."
2,Like Every Other Record From The Teen Pop Scene,"It's your average CD. The type of music you hear from every generic pop act these days. You don't think about the songs after hearing them. I always measure a great record by the impression the music leaves on me afterwards. If I suddenly catch myself singing it in my head where ever I am, or thinking about the lyrics and the meaning behind them, then I know the album is having an effect on me. Not in this case, however. It's just there."
1,One word...Awful,"I was a big Madonna fan. I went to her concerts, I bought her CD's, and life was good. Then came this CD and the burning question, how could such a talented, insightful artist change her style to this awful sounding mess? Granted I should have seen it coming with her brilliant rendition of ""American Pie"" but yet I still believed that some good still existed in the universe. Her fans that loved her first albums are now casualties in her efforts to explore a new type of music that somehow seems to escape me. The bottom line here folks is if you like her older albums you are going to hate this one."
1,Snore,"This cd s[tin]ks. Madonna sounds horrible, and the songs all sond the same ""exception american life"" that song is upbeat and all but the rap in it sounds so [bad]. Madonna just seemed predictable in that song like you knew each line before she sang it. She just rymed words without meening. The title is a failed attempt to get on the over done American theme, just to sell a cd. It is very empty, just listen to the lyrics. The best track on the cd is love profusion, it has the sound that you would expect from madonna. That song is the only reason that i gave this cd 1 star. Without that song this would be a zero if it was possible. This cd is a stienker, not a keeper, avoid!!"
5,Madonna creates the sound of Now again!!,"I love this CD! Once again Madonna creates a brilliant techno-pop production.This time she has a folky edge. Acoustic guitars strumming over pulsing electro beats, amazing strings sections and beautifully spare synth lines. It is haunting and emotional, uplifting and rewarding. She is fearless with her vocals and the songs are risky. But that it why it works. No one else even tries to do the things that Madonna does.Standouts are ""Nothing Fails"", ""Hollywood"" and my favorite track ""Easy Ride""This is sure to be a classic and will be the soundtrack of 2003!"
2,Poor Writing Ruins This Record,"I can't imagine any singer allowing lyrics like ""I'm having a soy latte, double shotte,""among a number of other misguided poorly written songs, to be part of their record. It's not only ridiculous, it talks down to the listener. Unless you're maybe 4 years of age, this is an insult to a record buyer's intelligence:))"
2,Sadly not Very Good,"I always hoped Madonna's voice would get better and better as the years went on, but she seems to be struggling throughout American Life. She doesn't have a real sense of conviction for the music. She was never a great singer, but the music always seemed to overshadow her limited vocal abliilities. This time there are two strikes agianst her. Her voice is still weak, but so is the music. Better luck next time."
3,Mature but don't sour,"I'm giving it 3 stars just because I'm a huge fan, but this album with the exception of ""Love Profusion"" really [was bad]. I miss fun Madonna."
1,Aging Madonna in Crisis,I can't look at her anymore. She's grotesque. Her voice is embarrassing-- especially on this record. Rapping??? Spare me. She needs to call it a day.
1,"Nice Try, But It Stinks","I never thought Madonna could sing, and I especially don't think so now after this sad record. She's really gone down hill. Instead, I recommend a Beyonce Knowles or a Britney Spears CD. These two women are much more talented, and a lot easier on the eyes...."
1,The Voice Is Weak,"When I listen to a CD it helps that the singer be beautiful(at least to me), as well as her voice. I think Beyonce Knowles, Gwen Stefani and Janet are sexy singers as well as beautiful. Madonna is very old looking to me now."
4,Sublime Melancholy,"Great artists always produce work that is relevant to their lives at the time. Madonna is obviously in love but still wondering what it means, where it will lead and what her obligations are to her husband, children and her fans. I find this an intriguing piece of work because it doesn't give you a sugar coated vision of commitment. Although most of the lyrics are positive the music is moody and underscores what may really be going on - doubt, loss of self identity and the realization that more work is needed to maintain her relationships and her place in the world.Keep it up Madonna - I'll always be listening."
2,"A old fan , buy her old stuff instead of American Life","I have looked forward to the new Madonna CD, and the first single, Amarican Life is a very good tune, but the rest is not.I prefer ray of light and Music instead of this one."
1,Didn't like it,"I am sorry, but Madonna's new album [is unsatisfactory]. The only song I actually liked was ""American Life"", ""Die Another Day"" and ""Hollywood"". That's it. This album has too many acoustics, the lyrics are pretty dumb, and the music is pretty bad. Nothing like the gems ""Ray of Light"" or ""Music"". I think Madonna should work with William Orbit again or Shep Pettibone. This is quite shocking for me to say because I have been a fan of Madonna for many many many many years, and I never thought I would give her a bad review, but this album is just bad. Buy instead Ray of Light, Music, Erotica, Something to Remember, Like a Virgin, Madonna(Debut), Like a Prayer, and Bedtime Stories. Those Albums rock!"
3,"awesome cd, but","think it's an ok track for madonna, but absolutely love the 'felix' remix and am disguisted bij missy's one. however every now and then i find myself humming and shake a litlle to missy's one; maybe it's grower,dunneu! peter's and paul's ones are great too, but love the one from peter lot's more!!!i believe this track is not representable for the rest of the album, and what's 'die' doning on it, can't believe it, it's somehow a little out of place. but the rest of the album is awesome!"
5,What A Suprise !!!,"Quite simply Madonna has suprised the world and her fans by producing what might be her best album to date. AMERICAN LIFE is consistent, thematic, engrossing, and somehow emotional. She has reinvented herself again, this time uses both Daft Punk style techno beats blended with acoustic political soul. There is not a clinker in the bunch...no filler...just great, solid tracks. RUN and buy this cd now...you won't be sorry."
3,American life... live it?,"Ok, Madonna is an expert showing us new, intelligent and great music... this disc is not the exception.""American Life"" it's her most personal album to date, where she shoots in almost every direction: her parents, the show business, the society in genetal, and a bunch of other things... the sound it's flawless, tracks like ""Hollywood"", ""Love Profussion"", ""Intervention"" and ""Mother and Father"" are easy to hear and swallow... the reason that i gave 3 stars to this CD it's only that ""Music"" it's more fun, and the bits are more solid... but, well, it's better to have right now a new Madonna CD that have to wait another 3 years to listen something new of this woman."
3,MADONNA'S WORSE WORK,"I'VE BEEN A MADONNA'S FAN FOR MANY YEARS, AND TO TELL THE TRUTH WHEN I LISTENED THE ENTIRE ALBUM I WAS JUST DISAPOINTED, I EXPECTED A BETTER WORK, BETTER SONGS AND RITHMS.IT SEEMS SHE IS BORED OF MAKING GOOD MUSIC. THE ONLY RESCATABLE TRACKS ARE ""LOVE PROFUSSION"" ""NOTHING FAILS"" THE REST SOUND JUST THE SAME. I LIKE MADONNA BUT I DIDN'T LIKE THIS ALBUM.FOR EXCELLENT MUSIC, BUY CHER'S ""LIVING PROOF"", AND IT'S SINGLES."
2,Just plain bad,"This is easily Madonna's worst album. The music is simplistic. The lyrics are self-absorbed. The arrangements come in only two flavors and are equally awful: the pseudo-acoustic sound that sounded so fresh on ""Music"" has worn out it's welcome and makes you wish she had never picked up a guitar or they are robotic electronica devoid of melody or passion. ""I'm so stupid"" is unlistenable. The rest of the tracks are just OK and suffer from a numbing sameness. The exceptions are ""nothing fails"" which is brilliant, moving and awe-inspiring and ""hollywood"", which, while weak compared to her other material is at least catchy and has a great hook. Last, but, not least: The artwork and packaging is horrid."
4,First Madonna CD I can listen to from start to finish,"Heres my review:American Life-Am I the only one who loves this song?Hollywood- Cute, but a little too ""I want to be a radio hit""I'm so stupid- Sorry, I love it. The lyrics suck, but this is catchy as hellLove Profusion- AmazingNobody Knows Me- OK, probably the only song I could do withoutNothing Fails- Nice, not as great as everyone says it isIntervention- Love itX-Static Process- Nice, thats about itMother and Father- Like it a lotDie Another Day- Sorry again, love itEasy Ride- Great songOverall, the first CD of hers that I can listen to from beginning to end. But you cant help but miss the intensity of a usual Madonna album. If it were any other artist, it would probably be their best. I cant help but feel that she played it safe with this one. Recommend it for anyone, but if you're a die hard Madonna fan, dont expect anything more than a catchy tune."
5,Misunderstood Work of Art,"(Note: This isn't really Ken Meyers, this is his daughter who always purchases stuff under this name)Yeah, I know what the critics have said. This is Madonna's worst album. Well I hate to say it but until I bought this album and REALLY listened to it, I believed them. When I finally bought it, I realized how stupid they really are and that this is actually one of Madonna's BEST albums and the reasons that they don't like it are probably because it's daring, innovative, edgy, and most of all, the lyrics are true. It's unfortunate that they would rather listen to cookie-cutter pop than this, but whatever. I blame it on the wrong time, the war, and the high approval ratings for Bush, but now, three years later and when Bush's approval ratings are in the toilet, it's time to see the genius that is American Life. (BTW if the problem is the Parental Advisory, get the clean version, that's what I did. They have one on here.)"
4,Ahead of it's time,"I'm sure that people will appreciate this CD more, in years-to-come. The production itself sounds pretty original and could very well be the sound of electronica music in the future (guitars and beats work nice here).No one was likely expecting Madonna to release something so ""experimental"". Mirwais Ahmadzai is a great producer and I think one of the finest that Madonna has collaborated with. I like the title track (detractors should get over their problem with her rapping), ""Hollywood"", ""Love Profusion"", ""Intervention"" and ""X-Static Process"".For Madonna fans who thought this wasn't one of her finest achievements, it's worth going back to go for another listen or two.Madonna's always seemed to be labelled as a ""pop star"" and not an artist. I think ""American Life"" defies that thinking as it comes across to me as one of her strongest.Love it!"
5,MADONNA DOESN'T FAIL,"This was Madonna's worst selling album of her career. BUT, DO NOT LET THAT FOOL YOU-this album sold millions of copies! For any other artist it would be considered one of their greatest selling albums, but for Madonna it was her worst selling album to date.However, I believe this is one of her greatest albums-I should know, I have every album she's made!This is one of her more personal albums, and I think the more Madonna matures, the more she lets the listener know more about her and her beliefs.This album-like the previous two-has many Kabbalah references, which I believe is great. Although, most people will probably miss them if they don't have any basic knowledge of Kabbalah.This is not a Kabbalah album though, it is Madonna at her personal best, and she did it great.A GREAT GREAT ALBUM!!! ONE OF HER BEST EVER!!!"
5,Nobody knows her,"Forget the nay Seya's, this is one terrific album. Yes I was hesitant to buy it after reading the negative reviews but after catching a sample of American Life on the radio I started to like it. I thought what's wrong with this song? Answer, nothing. Its upbeat and carries a good message. As for the rapping, you go girl! She does a good job and you can understand what she is rapping about. Personally I think it suits her. The rest of the songs are great; rarely do i press ""skip"" on my stereo. Each song is either catchy or has something poignant to say. Favorites include,American Life, Nobody knows me, Love Profusion, Nothing Fails and Die another day. However I feel that her most deepest song here has got to be X-static Process. ""I always wish I could find someone as talented as you but in the process I forgot I was just as good..."" a great song that tells of loving one's self and not wanting to copy cat others even her. Highly recommended."
5,Review Version 2.0,"I've already done a review of this album, and I'm going to do another one. After playing it a couple times, I found the best way to experience it completely is to listen to it on headphones with a really good sound system. This album was mixed extremely well and edited to perfection. The rap at the end of ""Mother and Father"" is brilliant, (hint: blast it with earphones). ""American Life"" dares to use instrumentation that mixes new technology of techno grooves with basic accoustic riffs that amazingly blend well together. Innovation that works. The final highlight of this cd in my oppinion is ""Nothing Fails"". It's become one of my all-time favourite Madonna songs that almost surpasses ""Inside of Me"". Strange how even some Madonna fans don't appreciate this album. Whatever Heather!!!!!!"
1,Madonna Quickly Crumbling Into Obscurity,Madonna is the most talentless and boring 'fake' in the history of popular music. She makes Britney Spears look like Joni Mitchell. There isn't much more to say about it.
2,Beyonce & Britney Spears Do it Way Better,"Madonna hasn't had decent music since 1985. She's since turned into a drag queen, looking like the relative of the Incredible Hulk. I guess she's been hitting the steroids. There is nothing more unattractive than a woman with unnatural muscles and pronounced veins in her upper arms and forearms. American Life offers nothing more than teeny bopper fare, and overdubbed annoying vocals, by a singer with a pathetic one octave vocal."
1,Mandonna:The New Hulk Hogan,What is she from the planet steriod??? Terrible singer. This album sucks waaay bad!
5,"With Madonna, it only gets better","""American Life"" is an awesome CD. If you are a Madonna fan then this is a must have CD. Even if you are not a Madonna fan, it is garanteed you will love this CD. This is truly one of her best CDs. If you liked her ""Ray of Light"" CD, then you will like this one too!! Go buy it right now!!"
3,Where's her voice?,"The album is not bad, I have appreciated her growth, but I certainly prefer to listen to her voice and to ""real"" instruments, instead of getting only electronic sounds. I don't like Mirwais style and I would prefer Madonna to let us appreciate her improved voice ability.I miss the warmth of her first albums. The new songs don't touch me inside, this makes me feel distant from Madonna... It's a pity!"
1,Oy!,"Years ago, I bought Madonna's American Life, the last known CD single in my collection. I had heard some of the other songs from her album on the radio; and they were as truly wretched as the tune I bought. The title track is especially appalling, as it combines Madonna's attempts at being not only a rapper but also an acoustic guitar musician a la Sheryl Crow or Joni Mitchell, which she fails to pull off. This record should not even have been released on her own label; that task should have been given to The Simpsons' Krusty The Clown, who would have had the dubious honor of having only one album credited to him on his Oy! Records. In the meantime, Madonna will be strutting in her underwear for the next 20 years and won't know when to quit. Oy!"
1,Not impressed,"Madonna's best album was ""Ray Of Light"". This one is just a big old mess. ""Love Profusion"" is the only track I can even listen to. Think it's time to sell this one back...."
3,UN-Impressive Instant,"Madonna and Mirwais Ahmadzai continue the formula they started on ""Music."" But unlike Impressive Instant from ""Music"" the style of ""American Life"" is less refined. If you are only interested in the singles American Life and Die Another Day, you're better off just buying the single, because the rest of the album sounds nothing like these tunes. The only song worthy enough to be on the album is Mother & Father. I wish the rest of the album could have successfully incorporated the electronic mixture as well as this song did. The lyrics about childhood angst match well with the beat. My second favorite song is Hollywood, also upbeat and danceable with catchy lyrics. I'm So Stupid, Nobody Knows Me, X-Static Process, and Easy Ride fall flat on the beat and lyrics department. Some of these are so boring I don't know why they were put on the album. The album is mediocre and only a true Madonna fan should buy it."
2,why the Vocoder?,"Okay, at first I liked this CD, but I really got annoyed by hearing that Vocoder on every other track. What's more, this is a pretty weak album by Madonna, who's done much better. The Material Girl is back, but this album could have been so much better. But I still love her, though. Try again, Madge!"
3,Disappiontment,"When I first heard the singles American Life, Die Another Day, and Hollywood, I had wondered what the rest of the album would sound but couldn't find it in stores. And no wonder this album is a HUGE let down especially when compared to both Music and Confessions on a Dance Floor. This could have been a chance for Madonna to show the world that she more than just electrobeats and love songs, she could have totally gone the electropop meets military & politics route that she had opened up the album with on the title track American Life but inside decides to go the Hollywood route with cool and danceable tracks but overall forgettable. Overall Madonna's ninth act was an utter disappoint which of course she redeems and goes beyond on her tenth album."
1,American Crap,"It's tasteless, highly unimaginative, and boring in content, just like the singer(so she calls herself one). Now that's stretching the truth. Madonna couldn't sing if her life depended upon it. She is dull, and grossly overrated. Please go away Madonna...Enough is enough."
2,Madonna's music has never sucked...till now,"Like MANY others, I have always been a huge fan of Madonna's.But I must say, if she started her career with the type of material she provided on this album...she wouldn't have made it far at all.This album was poorly done. The only two songs that were even worth listening to, have been out for some time.This album is SO very disappointing! The lyrics are so poorly written...Many of the lyrics are repetitive. This is certainly NOT her best work. If she does make another album, I can only hope that it is half way better than what she came up with for this one.It may be time for her to start allowing others to write for her.Many of her songs contain the same messages that her songs in past albums contained. I certainly hope that future albums are MUCH better. This one is a flop...In a nutshell: better find another CD to make it worth your money."
5,GREAT,"this song is the first single from her new album american life.it has a very different style.it mixes country,rnb,hiphop and electronic music.this is definately better than any music album track.the chorus is very catchy.and the rap is very fun to sing along.i recommend you to get this single.or for american life remixes you can get the maxi which features remixes by missy eliot,felix da house cat and peter raufher.this single's b-side is an unreleased remix of die another day.GET THIS SINGLE RIGHT NOW.YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED!"
1,an extremely overrated album,this has to be one of the most overrated album releases of recent times from the princess of sleaze who is known more for her dirty gimmicks than singing and changing names.the fact that this album tanked worldwide proves that she is slowly becoming irrelavant thankfully.i am looking for the day she retires.anyway this cd is awful.dont buy or listen to it.
1,a circle stencil,"This is the worst cd i have ever heard. Judging by the first 2 singles that are out now, hopefully some can spare themselves on this cd. If you have unfortunately already bought it, use it as a stencil for a perfect circle."
3,Not Bad...But Not The Best,"Ok, I like the songs ""American Life"",""Hollywood"",and ""Die Another Day""(a good dance tune). But The rest I couldnt care for. Save your money and buy something else. But....If you are a Madonna fan this is a must have."
1,It's Putrid,"Madonna can't sing, write, or act, for that matter. She bases her entire career on stupid hype. Her career's going nowhere nowadays...Good Riddance..."
4,Special Limited Edition,"The Madonna's American Life Special Limited Edition consists of a box including the CD album with 11 music tracks and an enhanced one, I haven't been able to run the enhanced track on my computer, this functionality might have expired, the CD artwork is different from the regular version, it has the same image as the album cover, besides that the box also contais a 23""x35"" poster, on one side it has the album cover on big size and on the other side it has the same images that are on the booklet of the regular version on a paper that resembles a newspaper, it is not definitely a premium quality paper and a stamp sheet with the image of album cover again but this time on stamp size. All the stamps have the same image."
1,Madonna needs to retire- Now!,"Oh my God...Madonna has hit rock bottom with this totally empty album. All its tracks are recycled songs that we have heard many times before. She lacks any originality with such drudgery as Nothing Fails and a laughably bad American Life- the title track. And she has the guts to rap, no less...My sides were in pain, from laughing so hard. You can differentiate one song from the other. Madonna sounds as monotone and tone deaf as ever- out of tune and out of sync. She has the misfortune of not being able to sing. At least her 80's music had some decent songs. This is plain sad, and Madonna needs to hang it up."
2,"Madge, What happened?????","This is from a fan of Madonna from the early days of her being played on 98.7 KISS FM N.Y.C. Please Madonna go back to your musical roots of upbeat forget about life for awhile dance floor music!! There, is where you glow better than anyone.Is it me or is anyone else disappointed that American Life came with no lyrics.I want to find out if she, during Love Profusion is saying I got you under my skin or I got Jew under my skin?Also,With Madonna being a mother now, I was hoping she would forgo wasting time on an ""EXPLICIT LYRICS"" CD. We don't care about hearing her swear. We just want an upbeat CD to Dance or do Pilates and Yoga to With a room full of hotties then you'll know Madonna, We'll be satisfied""!!!!!!."
1,need something new!,"this CD is only a big noise ,some songs sound good ,but she need to think in some tracks easy ,like BEDTIME HISTORIES ALBUM ,really I'm a fan of Madonna but this album ...sound like a PC-game's soundtrack ... much noise! I hope something better in the next CD."
2,Not Madonna's Best,"After awesome CD's like Ray of Light and Music, I was so excited for a new album from Madonna. Saddly, I'm VERY disappointed. The songs are all so average. When all the controversy happened over the American Life Song, I had to check it out and I immediatley thought it was so corny! Everytime I hear it I have to turn off the radio because it annoys me, especially that part where she raps about being, or should I say, not being ""satisfied"". The ""Hollywood"" song really bugs me too. There are a couple of ok tracks but mostly this is a disappointment...not Madonna's best...bummer...I'll be looking forward to her next CD, hopefully it will be worth the money."
2,Madonna can do better!,"I'm a BIG Madonna fan, and was really looking forward to this CD. Unfortunately it wasn't enjoyable. By the lack of sales, I guess I'm not alone in this thinking. The best song is ""Hollywood,"" because it has a driving beat. Don't get me wrong -- the CD has lots of potential. The problem is that it sounds too robotic. That works for Kraftwerk, but not for Madonna. Her best albums had imaginative and supportive production (Nile Rodgers, Stephen Bray/Patrick Leonard, William Orbit). Not so with this one. Let's hope Madonna has the entire CD remixed so that ""American Life"" can have a second life."
1,Madonna WAY Off Track,"After Ray of Light and Music, I thought Madonna had finally found a new, solid direction for her music. This album [is unacceptable]. I can't even say it's interesting. Only two tracks grabbed my attention: ""Nobody Knows Me"" and ""Mother, Father."" And PUH-LEEZE! Who is playing that AWFUL acoustic guitar? I feel bad railing her like this, because I love Madonna and all that she stands for. But this cd is one of the few that I regret buying. Madonna needs something. Like a Prayer."
2,Boys Life Is More Like It,"Vapid, self-absorbed, annoying, dressed up in last year's ""designer"" French fashions -- this is Madonna's WeHo/Chelsea Boy album!"
3,Get the regular CD. Don't spend money on the Enhanced,"Madonna must think she can get away with a lot nowadays. While the album is up to her usual standards, I can't recommend spending the extra TEN DOLLARS for the enhanced CD. What's different?It has a nice pretty boxIt has a poster inside.The enhanced CD has an 'exclusive' link to her website. That's it. On the website is a link to a 'making of' video of American. However, it's nothing more than the song dubbed over a collage of images. No interviews, no behind the scenes.. nothing. Just a TEN DOLLAR link to her website. Save your money and go for the"
2,"One, long, dreary song.","Madonna has finally managed to create a CD without one noteworthy, enchanting song on it. This CD, if one doesn't listen too carefully, sounds like one really long, really dull song. If one DOES listen carefully, one is assaulted by perniciously dreary lyrics like ""I'm not religious... you make me want to pray."" Blech. While we're at it, what's with the voice filters? It is to be hoped that in future endeavors Madonna will either return to form and create mindless, perky pop or give her proposed CDs a listen and decide that they're too pedestrian to be unleashed on the public at large."
3,It's a hit and a miss.,"While some reviewers feel the lyics may be weak, I feel they are pretty darn strong. In fact, I have never had a problem with Madonna lyrics. I will bet that if the lyrics were read without knowing who wrote them, the opinions would be different. The problem with this album is the music that encases the lyrics. I can't put my finger on it but it's missing something. Possibly an extra beat or melody. Bottom line, it's bland...very bland. There is so much potential here and it was completely missed. With regards to the vocal effort, it seems as though she was uninterested when she sang it. This album is kinda of flat all around."
2,20 Years Later...It Could Be A Lot Worse,"It hurts to read so many reviews that automatically pass this album off as if it were the ""Gigli"" of the music world in 2003, especially since that is really not true. Admittingly, it is the worst Madonna record I have heard, but there are definitely a few highlights that save this album from being truely disasterous.""American Life"" is a decent upbeat song and fun to listen to, though not really dance-able or anything. For a title track, it is on the weak side, but still can be enjoyed. ""Nothing Fails"" is undoubtedly the stand-out track on this record. The lyrics are touching and the overall message is superb. A soft ballad of sorts to warm the heart and embrace the positivity of relationships.Yes, I was and still am disappointed by this album, but that does not mean it is a complete failure."
1,"This CD Stinks So Badly, It's ""Pungent""","It's too bad Madge doesn't come the realization that she is just a ""very"" average vocalist who hasn't been blessed with a great voice. She tries here, but fails because the material is so weak. Plus she has the nerve to take a stab at rapping. My sides were splitting from laughing so hard. It looks like she's in dire need of a big time producer here. It may help her music sound passable. American Life has a low budget sound and suffers from way too much overdubbing. I think it's time to pack it all in and try another career altogether."
1,Disappointed Madonna Fan,"What can I say....this CD was disappointing from the very first song to the last! While I've been a Madonna fan for 20yrs now, even I could not ignore the fact that this CD was pure ""filler"" to keep Madonna in the public's eye while she works on the REAL album that will come out at some point! Every song is over engineered with no catchy sound...something Madonna is generally well-known for producing. Overall, the CD-listening experience can be compared to eating a dry rice cake...when what you really wanted was a chocolate fudge cake! Yes, its a wierd statement to make, but that's my way of saying that this was one of the most unsatisfactory music-listening experiences I've ever had!"
1,Embarrassing,"Madonna was just voted the worst actress in history(that being a pop-singer turned actress, or attempting to be one), by readers and critics in Blender Magazine this month. Mariah Carey came in a distant second. As far as this album is concerned, the same could be said as well. Without a busload of bigtime producers and writers this time, Madonna is on her own w/American Life, and it shows. Her voice is so painfully thin that the mediocre material suffers even more. And the shameful overdubbing proves that she is not a real singer, but someone who is desperately trying to cover up all the inconsistencies in her weak 1 octave vocal range. When you factor in all the electronica(that hasn't been popular in 3 years), you have an embarrassing CD, that would be difficult to get 50 cents for at a yard sale."
2,uh...,am I the only one that thinks shes saying -I got JEW under my skin- in the song Love Profusion ??
1,It's Rotted to the Core,"Like a rotten apple this ""garbage"" is the only way to describe this mess of a cd. Mandonna looks awful and sounds awful. May she go away forever!"
1,Just Call her 'Oldy ',Is this what you want to listen to?Old-gramps doing Karaoke. Even the Wicked Witch of the West is Cuter than Manny.http://www.madonnalicious.com/images/2005/london_260305_cycle2.jpg
1,Anti-American Life,"The title of this should be ""Anti-American Life"", because Madonna is about as American as crumpets and scones and Earl Grey tea! This is her most unimpressive CD of all time... it seems that Madonna herself is bored half out of her mind singing the cloying tunes she penned! The whole mess has absolutely no direction and if she scores a Top 10 hit in the US from this, I'd be very surprised! I have not heard the title track played one time on any radio station! The title ""American Life"" is a trick, to lure Americans to buy her CD and help support her lavish lifestyle! Don't be fooled by her trickery this time! Just remember how Madonna used to be, circa 1986!"
2,"Big Madonna fan, but not of this album","In anticipation of her upcoming release, ""Confessions On the Dancefloor"", I was checking out what people had wrote about her previous albums. I was very shocked to see several reviews offering 5 stars of this album. Being a huge fan of Madonna, I have every album and this by far is the least enjoyable. Delving into issues of politics and family, the album falters steadily off the invigorating pace she had going with her 2 previous albums. While 'American Life' and 'Hollywood' try to recover the Mirwais-influence felt on ""Music"", the attempt at rap altogether swallows up the first single and the ladder, although the one of the better songs on the album lacks the commercial readiness for any type of radio airplay. Unfortunately the best song ""Die Another Day"", was only added on after being a hit previous to the album's release; and to get that I suggest buying the maxi-single that include several amazing remixes."
2,Yawn,Save your money! All the innovation that was part of Madonna's early and mid career is completely gone on this CD. Is it dance? Is it rock? Is it pop? Who knows - it's all over the place!
2,"Interesting, but a stinker","Like Erotica, this is one of Madonna's more interesting efforts, but not one that is enjoyable to hear. It feels like Madonna has lost her way, both musically and lyrically, using tired beats as a backdrop for her half-baked thoughts on materialism and spirituality. Skip this one and pick up the shockingly superior Music."
3,Not one of her best albums,"On this album, it is clear that Madonna knows how to speak her mind whether you like it or not. Clearly, critics and album sales prove that people did NOT like it. While most songs have a good dance beat to it, that's about the best part of the album."
1,A Collection of ...,I have been a Madonna fan since she first came out and I own every album. I'm sorry to say that Music was disappointing and American Life is even worse.I really feel that she is just throwing whatever stuff... she can into albums without really putting any time or effort into them. I guess she doesn't have to anymore.I can honestly say that I will never buy another album of hers again. She has really become a has-been and needs to move out and leave it to the fresh & young talent.
2,OK,"Has Madonna ever sung w/the beautiful Cyndi Lauper? I think they should do a duet. Or maybe not. I think they both have different voices, but would blend well together. Her first album, her self-titled one, is still her best one. My opinion."
1,The Worst Madonna Album of All,"I like Madonna normally but thought this album was just horrible. The songs are monotonous, repetative, and all sounded pretty much the same to me. I don't know why she would make an album with electronica-like undertones because it's just not her style. She's always trying to push one envelope or another, but this one just wasn't pushed correctly. ""American Life"" was the worst song. She actually attempts to rap, but it's about yoga and coffee. That's not exactly a very rap-like bit of subject matter."
1,Sounds Forced and Contrived,"There isn't anything new or ground-breaking on American Life. Madonna neither has the vocal talent nor writing ability to lift this dull material. She's better off, singing dance songs, like on her self-titled LP, than whining about ""soy lattes."" As in her attempt at rapping, it's laughable."
2,Che Madonna,"Here's a tip...If you're gonna have album cover that tries to make you look like a revolutionary, at least have something to say when it comes time to spin the disc."
2,Mediocre Madonna,"Madonna takes a crack at rapping in ""American Life"". To demonstrate her gangsta tendencies and secure a coveted Parental Advisory stamp, she tosses ""F...it"" into the chorus -- scared of that. These tracks will surely spark heated debate over which is weaker -- her vocal ability or her lyrics. Is it any wonder the CD liner features Madonna spelling out her name and the CD title cheerleader style (albeit a cheerleader with an AK-47) rather than listing the song lyrics? Big yawn."
4,Madonna Controversial But AWESOME!,"The new CD single ""American Life"" is a little controversial and a bit irreverent but awesome. The dance mixes rock, like usual. Madonna is always in the fore front of dance and club music. Some version have bad words in them, this one is the definitely not for the 18 and under. American Life is a must for all you dance crazed fans... Also included a version of ""Die Another Day""."
4,I Can Actually Listen to the Whole CD,"Well, this CD is better than her previous album ""Music"" in many ways. First off it seems more polished overall, but c'mon Madonna, only 11 tracks? Actually if you count the recycled ""Die Another Day"" it would only be 10. In any case the tracks that are there sound good, and like I said, this is one of few albums I can actually listen to all the way through. You'll find a mix of hip string electric beats, and the ocassional acoustic rendered tune. While the lyrics may not always be the most sensible or coherent, the music and beats are top notch. The thing is that Madonna tries to mix it up in variety and style to keep the album sounding new and fresh, and while not everyone may like that, it suits this album just fine. Good Job on a nice addition to your discography Madonna!!!"
5,Masterpiece...don't listen to naysayers,"This album is a masterpiece! Screw the idiotic critics who call Bruce Springsteen ""talented."" The only low point on the album is the rap in American Life, an otherwise good song. ""Nothing Fails,"" ""Intervention,"" and ""Nobody Knows Me"" are Madonna at her best."
4,Aaahhh... Madonna...,"I have much respect for Madonna, so she can do no wrong in my eyes. This cd differs greatly from her others, but that is to be expected. If you like the songs from the radio, you should get it, because there is more where that came from. There is a twinge of religious lyrics in this cd, more so than usual. It's one of those you have to listen to a couple of times to get into."
2,Left no impression on me,"My hope was that Madonna's voice would mature over the years. Unfortunately, she hasn't gone beyond 1 octave on most of her offerings. It's sad to say that Britney Spears has a better vocal range. AL is sadly mediocre, not helped by Madonna's flat vocals. I gave this a listen when it first came out, but haven't had the need to give it another listen since."
3,Mirwais' sound is getting stale,Gone is the majestic production of previous Madonna albums replaced by the predictable production style of Mirwais. What was an interesting change of pace on Music has now become somewhat boring and stale. The disastrous Die Another Day single is included which is unfortunate as it has nothing to do with the overall album. Many of the tracks are quite listenable until Mirwais steps to the forefront and Madonna gets lost. I miss the smooth William Orbit and Guy Sigsworth sound of prior albums. Perhaps in time I will come around to this one but after several times of listening the start and stop nature of the album just makes it a chore to get through.
3,Is this an American Dream?,"Well, here it is after many attempts to downloading the album via the web. I went and bought the CD on it's release day. All I can really say is that is okay. There is really nothing groundbreaking here. And I must warn the fans...the limited edition cd does not have a thing to merit the extra cash. I felt pretty dumb.The title song is catchy but a little bit much once she broke into her rap. What is up with that? Your're forty-something Mo,please act like it. The lyrics in all the songs are as paper thin as her British Accent.I know you are probably thinking I'm just jaded. But I do have all the albums, and this one is just recycled from the previous ""Music"" album."
2,"Six words: The album sucks, the remixes rule!","Pass on the album and stock up on the singles. In the hands of the right mixer, including no less than the likes of Paul Oakenfold, Peter Rauhoffer, Victor Calderone, Above & Beyond, Deepsky and others, these mediocre half-baked nu-skool-wanna-be tracks really come to life. ""Hey, Mr. DJ..."""
3,"Good, Solid, Not Quite Great","I'd have given this 3 1/2 stars if I could. This disc is an extension of the direction Madonna had on Music - hard electronic beats with cold, clear vocals on most songs, softer and more personal guitar on the rest. After a few listens I discovered there is more depth to the songs than is apparent at first. The lyrics are personal - almost all in the first person about her own life and experiences - but not as revelatory or warm as on Ray of Light. And the electronica is not as fresh or bright as on Music - I fault the production for that. The same sounds pop up in many of the songs, giving the album a needless level of sameness. While the songs themselves are quite good - look for quite a few hit singles - the production holds them back a bit. I'm looking forward to remixes that bring out more of the melody and warmth that is kind of buried on the album. Overall, a very good Madonna album, but Ray of Light, Music and Erotica are better."
1,MADONNA'S DECADENCE ALBUM.,"Starting from the cover art, you can see it's awful, and poor.Now let's talk about the music.There are just very few nice songs on the album, like ""X-Static Process"" and ""Nothing fails"".Both of these songs have nice and deep lyrics, joined by good string arrangements.""I'm so stupid"", ""Nobody knows Me"" or even the main single ""American Life"" are a clear show of her few real talent. Most of the songs are repetitive, boring and absolutely stupid.If she thought that turning against the nation that has fed her, would be a hit, she was wrooooong.Madonna's succesful days must be over, now she has to kiss other singers to get a little bit of attention, 'cause other way she would fail.Bad album. Madonna's good works ended with ""Music"""
4,very good album,"This album is very different from her other albums she made, american life is more rock and less techno sounds but it has new beats and lots of guitar playing, she did great making this album so i hope u'll like it 2(fav tracks)love profusionhollywoodim so stupidmother & fathernothing fails"
2,"Unfortunately, her worst album to me",Madonna's American Life is unfortunately her worst sounding. She doesn't continue the momentum here like she did on Music. There's so many keyboards and synthesizers here that drown out her voice. And not a lot of the songs are memorable. They don't hook into your head like the ones from Music and other albums. Her reinvention factor doesn't help here. And maybe she should leave her personal feelings to herself and not overexpose them too much on this album. But many top selling artists have one bad album within their career. I hope that Madonna makes a better album with the next one in the future. She's too multitalented an artist to sing through disjointed uneven songs as this album is.
1,GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE,ES LO PEO QUE HE ESCUCHADO ¡MADONNA QUE TE PASA! A LANZADO TANTOS SENCILLOS DE ESTE ALBUM QUE LOS QUE MAS SONARON Y ESO PORQUE TENIAN GRAN PROPAGANDA FUERON AMERICAN LIFE (flop flop flop) HOLLYWOOD OTRO flop Y LOS DEMAS QUEDARON EN VEREMOS...................(EN DEFINITIVA LA EPOCA DE MADONNA YA PASO SU GRAN HORA DEL EXITO YTA SE ACABO POBRE DE ELLA PORQUE HACE BUENA MUSICA EXCEPTO ESTA PORQUERIA DE ALBUM ES UN COMPLETO ASCO)
2,Moledonna's Sad Song,I just feel sorry for her now. She looks totally masculine and she can't sing or act. She's dropped a stink bomb with her latest.
1,Give it up Madonna!!!,"Madonna is SOOO OVER... I can't believe people are STILL supporting her.Don't bother purchasing this album, wait until Tuesday to pick up Janet Jackson's album ""Damita Jo"" March 30th, I don't even like Janet but I'll give her props on this one."
2,just say no,"I must say that when I heard about the video for ""American Life,"" I knew something was up. Madonna was up to her old bag of tricks: controversy in order to get her name in the press.Once I bought this album, I realized why: it's just not good. The music is fine, but the lyrics are terrible and repetitive beyond belief (two things that really don't go together). And don't even get me starting on her voice...All in all.... a large disappointment. Hopefully the remixes will save this.Now it is time time for a soy latte and a double shotté. Maybe that will satisfy me more than this album.Advice: Get ""Music"" or ""Ray of Light"" if you want a good madonna album."
3,NICE EFFORT...,"It was a good try, she tried to expand her horizons. But her voice sounded too electronic. She should have used her own vocals and not computerize it. And I believe that the beats were not rich or strong enough.I think American Life and Love Proffusion are great songs But the rest seem to be missing something."
2,Smelldonna's Stinker,"How can anyone like listening to this hasbeen? She's a really bad singer(and I mean ~BAD~), and anyway her career has completely nose-dived.*2 Stars* One for the tacky cover(it takes guts), and the other for her one octave voice. At least she has William Hung beaten."
3,"Impressive Sound, Disappointing Lyrics, Features","I was initially surprised and impressed by the very different music on the CD. The title track, ""American Life"" is enjoyable enough. I think the rap just ruins it, but it's probably the best song on the CD. I also particularly liked ""Hollywood"", ""Love Profusion"", ""Nothing Fails"", and ""Die Another Day"".I was very disappointed, however, that many of the songs sounded very similar and the lyrics for all tracks are sickeningly repetitive. The so-called Enhanced CD includes some icons and a downloadable audio file. Save your money and buy the regular CD."
2,Nothing fails...except this album,"I discovered Madonna when I was about 15 listening to I'll remember and I started loving her due to You'll see. I really like her voice, especially in Evita, and I think Ray of Light is one of the best album ever produced. Excellent music and voice acting, deep meaning, and still fun (i.e. Beautiful Stranger). Music is interesting, too. Excellent tracks, but not at Ray of Light level, only for entertainment without meaning. American Life is so bad. I was expecting something special, but Mirwais sucks!! I like some songs, especially Nothing Fails and Mother and Father, but there isn't a killer-track..everything looks the same and she sounds so flat in every song. If you listen to her ballads like Take a bow and The power of goodbye you can see how well she shows her feelings, she rocks! But now she seems to have lost her touch. Maybe the tour can revitalize her, I hope.We'll see!!"
1,A Below average effort,"Back in the old days, Madonna had some pretty good pop tunes, if not overly ""deep,"" but on American Life, she's starting to run out of ideas- making it seem very stale and lifeless. Madonna's problem is that she's trying way too hard to fit it with the current pop trends...it doesn't work. It makes her look desperate. The one thing that will keep Madonna from being able to achieve true respect and longevity, past the 20 yr. mark, is that unfortunately she is not blessed with a true singer's voice. She's so limited in her ability to 'measure up' with the true vocalists, it will only hurt her in the long run. Also, her bag of tricks have run dangerously low, and the public is quickly losing interest, and moving on to fresher acts. There's really nothing left after that."
5,MASTERPIECE,I wonder where Madonna will be in a few years when she is in her mid fifties? Hopefully she will be making great music like this. AMERICAN LIFE is the best of her techno inspired albums and her most personal to date. If you like great music and top production this is a great album. Especially if you have a 5.1 dolby stereo system. From the first song to the last this album is perfect and totally grooving!
5,LUV ELECTRO!!!,"I'M CRAZY FOR ELECTRO!!!I love Felix da Housecat, Miss Kittin, Fischerspooner, Kylie's ""Fever"" but... AMERICAN LIFE IS SOOO MUCH BETTER. Madonna really impressed me with this release. 100000000 stars from the star who shines brighter than all the rest ;-D"
4,different,"For the most part I enjoy this CD. The lyrics are heart-felt, (but very specific to Madonna only) ""Mother & Father"" being one of my favorites.Madonna should leave rap to the rappers."
5,AMERICAN LIFE: MAD - On - - Nah !,"The CD is a complete pleasant departure from her past two projects.The production level on this CD is greatly toned down from the previous projects yet her grooves remain strong. Imagine a meeting between JEWEL & REM discussing politics and the current state of the world in a faded discotheque and you will get the texture and tone of this CD.Madonna is a master at creating musical art. Her recent CD will grow on you ~ even if you have never been a fan.Vocally, Madonna takes some risks on this CD, she tries to vocally return to a simpler presentation and style. Her vocals may remind you of a time during the mid 1980s when she wanted to be considered as MATERIAL & CONTROVERSIAL !All in all ~ This CD is a musical success ! AMERICAN LIFE will give you a BANG for your buck !"
4,Good buy!,I almost didn't buy this because of all the negative reviews... but since I have every other Madonna CD I had to get it. I'm glad I did because I also think this is one of her better CD's and I have enjoyed it immensely already.
3,Okay ... Not her best!,Now i am a Madonna fan and wasn't expecting a very danceable album but most of the songs are a step or two up above ballads not very catchy but good! Standout song: Hollywood good hook and get stuck in you head! But not worth 5 stars!
2,Waste of Money,"Madonna should stick to what she does best - dance style pop hits. While I appreciate her longevity and her finger on the pulse of shock value, this album as a whole is way short of talent. Kudos for ""american life"" and her desire to take on the bush administration's hopelessly wrong policies. But the rest of the songs are lacking any punch or soul. She is just rambling on about Jesus Christ"
2,Unfortunately This Cd Sounds Flat,"Madonna is out of tune on so many songs here. From Love Profusion to Nothing Fails. The songs lack inspiration, and imo, this current release is about 10 Giant Steps back from her ROL CD. I never thought Madonna was that good of a singer, but her music was danceable...not so on American Life. I listened to this a few times, and haven't put this in my CD player since May of 03."
1,crap,"Why bother with a long review when I can sum it up with one word -- ""Crap.""She is the female version of Donald Trump. Take someone's idea and make a million from the idea as consumers aren't thinking who did a product in the first place, or too lazy to investigate. By buying her cds, you are buying inferior product -- seek out the original British artists from the 80s who did her style better and with originality.Don't buy her cds -- let her live on her millions without contributing to her ""fund."""
3,Calderone mix is good,"In my opinion American Life was the WEAKEST song on the new album. Included on here is an edit of that track, as well as a Calderone Remix of Die Another Day. Now, I for one despise EVERY SINGLE REMIX that CALDERONE has EVER done for Madonna...except this one! This one is actually good..really good in fact. It's easily one of the best DAD remixes. I find it kind of odd that they included a 9-minute remix on a 2 track single though..."
2,Get Me A Fleet- Please!,"I got a violent stomach ache from this record. It's terrible. Why does Madonna call herself a singer. More like the terminator, best describes her."
4,The First Positive Review,"Everyone else obviously hates American Life, but I think it's pretty good. The only song that I don't really care for is ""Mother and Father"" because the lyrics and her rapping are a little childish. I do respect her for doing what she wants to do, but I just don't really like it. The other 10 songs are really good. The lyrics are simple and honest, and the music agrees with the themes of the songs. This is the first of Madonna that I've bought, but it encouraged me to buy more of her. So, all in all, I like American Life. Anyone should buy it if they're into Madonna."
2,Not gaga...,"As a huge Madonna fan, I was very disappointed with this album. She should have written a book of poetry and put out a dance album."
3,Most underrated musical artist of the century,"Anybody who thinks Madonna is not talented should get a hold of her ""Reinvention Tour"" DVD when it comes out, which, judging by her decisions recently, might be eight years from now. That said, ""American Life"" doesn't live up to my defense of Madonna. In fact, she almost gives into her idiotic critics by singing in her chirpy voice, writing insanely childish lyrics, and..oh my gosh...rapping! The cd also has it's gems as well. ""Nothing Fails"" is the most beautiful song Madonna has performed since ""Rain."" ""Intervention"" is a well written song and ""X-Static Process"" is tear jerkingly beautiful. ""Easy Ride"" could have been a classic, but the computer bleeps ruin this otherwise great song. I can only hope that Madonna learns from the mistakes she made on this record to produce a classic album like she's used to, hopefully soon."
2,Disappointing,There are 3 or 4 good tracks on this CD. As a longtime fan I rushed out and bought the CD immediately. I probably wouldn't be as disappointed if I didn't buy the litmited edition with the advertised extras such as the ENhanced CD which is basically just a link to the Madonna website.
1,Music: the b-sides,"When I bought Music a few years ago I was afraid Madonna was hitting another low point in her career. American Life has proven that she is in another slump. Her songwriting on this album is contrived and manipulative. The title track is a fluffy song about how superficial fame and celebrity are. This topic is not new for Madonna (check out Substitute for Love and Goodbye to Innocence for superior songs on this topic). She continues with the silly child like writing skills that she began with Music and the ""skipping sound"" is also continued on this CD. The familiar vocoders are also present along with a couple of ""minimalist folk/electronica"" songs. Madonna and her producer have brought nothing new to the table with American Life. In fact this album should be retitled ""Music: the b-sides"""
5,One of her BEST!!!!,This CD is by far one of the best Madonna CD's ever. The songs are placed well as well as the direction of her music. Although the music is not so disco ballish... it is more personal yet exciting in its own way... i recommend this CD to everybody... i waited a long time since MUSIC and i'm more stunned with the results that she has produced.
1,irredemable garbage,"Self-absorbed, cynical, horribly contrived, inconvincing posturing: Madonna has done all these before in her career, but very rarely on the same CD. American Life is a truly black eye on her otherwise stellar career, and one I'm sure she'll have problems topping. Her credibility is all but lost after a year of garbage: this album, a horrible first single whose controversial video was pulled, the Gap commercials (what the hell was Missy on??), and the whole Britney scandal. I mean, Madonna, shying away from controversy? Welcome to the 21st century, I guess. And that rap? Like Ed the Sock said, it was trying to be hip, but is the musical equivalent of a soccer mom in stretch pants. Ouch. Garbage."
4,not her strongest but impressive lyrics,"AFTER PICKING UP AMERICAN LIFE I BEGAN TRACKING ALL 11 SONGS, SO FAR EACH SONG HAS STRONG LYRICAL CONTENT BUT THE SOUND IS KIND OF THIN. I LIKE AMERICAN LIFE LYRICALLY AS WELL AS MOST OF THE MUSICAL MOMENTS THIS IS JUST A SIGN THAT MADONNA NEEDS 2 PLUG BACK IN THE ELECTRIC GUITAR LIKE SHE DID VIA RAY OF LIGHT.ALL IN ALL EACH SONG IS GOOD BUT I STILL CONSIDER RAY OF LIGHT HER MOST IMPRESSIVE ALBUM OF HER CAREER, EVEN THOU IT WAS BACK IN 98, U GOTTA CHECK OUT RAY OF LIGHT AND WATCH A POP ICON GROW UP AND PLUG IN THAT GREAT ELECTRIC SOUND.AMERICAN LIFE IS GOOD BUT NOT GREAT"
1,"It's So Stupid! (Only Title I could Think Of, Sorry)","Never has a Madonna album been as bad as this! And it's hard for me to write this, being a huge fan. She's done WAY better than this."
4,Madonna's revenge,"Hey, all you slicing and dicing Miss Maddy here. I for one am quite impressed, though 4 stars, Die another day, has so got to go, suprised she included it at all. As for the title track, is a bit overdone, but I feel that this is her most personal, and somehow regretful album. A lot of regret towards 'Hollywood' and for myself, I couldn't get out of LA fast enough. But the other tracks, yet not really pop radio friendly, and a glimpse into an older and wiser Madonna. I think 'Love Profusion' and 'Xtatic process' are two of the most beautiful songs in her career to date. It is on replay most of the day, and I think you should all give it another listen... and listen this time. There is much wisdom in those words."
1,What happened? :),"I'm sorry, Madonna...I've been a fan since Day 1....but this has to be the worst release you've done! I have everything that has been recorded, and still get in my ""Madonna Mood"" to listen to the older recordings. I heard the whole CD once, and will not listen to it again."
5,Exactly the opposite of the cover and of the reviews,"This record is a great guitar-and-voice album with rare emotion from any artist, let alone from one as removed from ""the normal life"" as Madonna. It's an exquisite listen and a real accomplishment. If you wondered what Madonna would be doing in 20 years when she first writhed onto the radar, you never would have thought this---writing, singing and playing music that is vulnerable, personal and better than anything on the radio right now. Try it---you'll like it."
3,OK,"Im not crazy about this cd.Ive listened to it,buy I wouldntbuy it.TOO HARSH.I like the 1980s MADONNA THE BEST.INSTEAD ofBUYING the AMERICAN LIFE CD,BUY THE VERY BEST OF CHER or BROADWAYMY WAY-LINDA EDER."
1,What the hell happened to Madonna?,"I like Madonna but I have to say something:WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT THE HELL IS THIS $HIT???????This album is such a total dissapointment that it is almost heartbreaking to see Madonna fall so low here. Everyone involved should just bury the memories of being involved with this project.Nothing on here is worth listening to. I have really really tried to like this album, even forcing myself to like it by playing it countless times but I just can't and have totally given up. This album is just terrible.Even the cover is awful. Don't buy this."
2,Is there some music behind the base ?,"Hi,We know that Madonna is inovating, but I think she missed it here. When listening this album on an ordinary cd-player things will be ok. Ones you use a better quality stereo tower, you do not hear any music anymore. It's only heavy base you hear. The music would be a 3-4 star if you would leave out the base.Sorry Madonna, CD will not be listened to often."
1,It's Rather Pathetic,Madonna's face looks like an old piece of shoe leather. Poor thing....her music isn't much better.
1,Disgustingly offensive,"""American Life"" is 11 tracks of tactless, ""serious"", (and for the most part) straight-faced pop songs of Madonna whining about her enormously petty set backs over the past 20 years. Namely, poor reception to her god awful ""Swept Away"" movie, her annoyance with the shallow entertainment industry, and how dissatisfied she is with her wealth.Are you f---ing kidding me? This is easily the most irritatingly naive and downright disturbing collection of lyrics I've ever read. Who the hell sympathizes with this kind of bullplop? Who could even TOLERATE this sort of delusional whining from one of the biggest, richest, pop stars of the past 20 years!? The fact that ANYONE could be so horrifyingly arrogant as to entitle this dung ""American Life"" in a post-9/11 America is jaw dropping - and I reacted this way as someone barely even affected by 9/11! It's truly amazing.Oh, and the music is lifeless, too. Kinda takes a sideline to the lyrics, though."
2,Time for the Old Coot To Pack It Up,Yeah..I rather feel sorry for the aging Britney wannabe. Sounds like the old coot Madonna is trying to emulate those teen pop sensations. This CD is just not very good. It makes LAV and ROL sound actually good.
1,"Mr. Hanky ""The X-mas Poo,"" Sings Better Than Madonna","Madonna looks awful with her poppin' veins and muscles. And she can't sing in tune. She looks old, 'very old,' and is waaaay past her 15 minutes. Her expiration date should of read 1986."
1,Pass on this Madonna album,"Uninspired musical production (""I'm So Stupid,"" ""Mother and Father""). Laughable lyrical content (""American Life,"" ""Die Another Day""). The baroque use of electronica and voice synthesizing do little to showcase Madonna's commentary on the American Dream (or American life, as the title suggests). Overall, this album is a missed opportunity. We know, as listeners, that a middle-aged woman as shrewd and business-oriented as Madonna would have better things to say."
5,Madonna as Frankenstein's Monster?,"Madonna's American Life will not be appreciated now. Judging from a slew of negative reviews in major publications(which have focused more on her age and her gender than the music) we are seeing Madonna backlash #2 (her first being the time surrounding Erotica- a backlash against her ""unfeminine"" aggressive sexuality) It seems critics prefer their Madonna happy, voguing, flirty and shiny, not biting, in-your-face and opinionated. Too bad. American culture made Madonna. Now she can talk about it all she wants.American Life is a surprisingly modern folk album. It's about rebirth. Discover it.American Life will grow on you. It's first-listen simplicity is a mask for a jillion layers of meaning waiting to be understood."
4,Die Another Day & More,"This album is mostly of interest to me due to the song Die Another Day, which was used for the James Bond film soundtrack of the same name. Plus you might find the rest of the tracks are pretty darn good too."
1,Pure junk,"This magbetic square is pure junk. It says made in USA, but looks more like a piece of junk from China. The ""magnets"" are nothing but magnetic tape. They are so weak they will just barely hold, if at all. If you bump the metal, it falls off. I am going to buy some good magnets and glue them on to try and salvage these squares. Save your money. Not even worth a 1/10th of the price to buy them."
5,Great Bag,Our item came and we were happy with it. It was perfect. Thank you. This bag is great for players who are not quite big enough to be lugging around those huge bags. It as room to carry all your gear even if it is smaller.
5,Wow! Great show!,"I got to catch a Zero show in '86 and never forgot the energy. This disk captures it in all the glory deserving of such a great jam band. Zero's blend of jazz, rock, R and B, and yes, some very Garcia like, trailing guitar solos, is sure to please any listener of great musicianship. Steve kimock and Co. are the bomb! A very enthusiastic 5 stars! Thanks Guys!"
4,This albulm is a great listen.,"I like the overall albulm. I was dissapointed with Papa was a Rolling Stone. I've seen Mind's Eye rock it a lot harder. Forever is Nowhere, leaves me (as the song is) speachless. I love riding to that tune."
4,Great Psychedelic Band,"Zero has long been one of the great San Francisco psychedelic bands, but they have rarely ventured out of the bay area. This disk features them in their best context--live. Legendary guitarist Steve Kimock wails away in spectacular fashion on several instrumental pieces. Forever is Nowhere is a masterpiece of soaring slide guitar, and the cover of Little Wing is of the same stature as the original and with the Clapton version. The quality of the recording is excellent. Fans of great guitar and psychedelic music in general should enjoy this immensely."
2,student,"As I will be starting undergra engineering this fall(sept 00), I bought this book because I thought it would be a good supplement to my regular upper level calculus book from my senior year and thought it would be of some use in university. I really found this book to be a dissapointment(as well as shaums 3000 solved problems in calculus). The way the material is presented is not clear at all. The problem solutions are hardly presented in a way in which the reader can understand and learn from them. They just confuse the reader even more. As I have found with all Schaum's outlines and solved problems books, they are of poor quality and of no real use to anyone. Try Harcourt Brace Jovonovich calculus (search HBJ Calculus). It is much better"
1,Terribly Disappointed!,"My daughter received this highchair/swing as a gift for her second birthday! It was a absolute piece of JUNK! I would have to say that it was definetely not worth the money. As far as looks it was very realistic but every time my daughter barely touched it, it fell apart. The tray wouldn't stay on for anything. It was quite heavy and if it were to fall on your child's toe it would really hurt. Every time she took her baby out of the high chair the fabric seat would come off with the baby. The snaps that were supposed to keep the seat from swinging when it was converted to a high chair were useless. Most of the time we had a swinging high chair with no tray or seat, pretty much just metal bars. I wouldn't recommend this toy to anyone! The Little Mommy high chair is sturdier, but is exceptionally small! We are still in search for the right high chair."
1,Pain in the neck!,"These Ocean Wonders toys for baby dolls have got to be the worst toys that I have ever come across! My daughter got all of the different sets for Christmas from a friend (so I could not take them back or trust me that would've been the first place I went to on the 26th). They do not stay together! I put a piece on, I stick the doll in it, and the piece pops right off. They are not very sturdy at all. They really need to be screwed together or something. I would not buy any of these items at all. And now two months later, she doesn't even play them at all! Very disappointed."
1,Very disappointed!,"My 3 year old received this for Christmas from Santa and was very excited Christmas morning. It is very cute and looks very much like one for a real baby, but.....just like other reviewers stated the tray just would not stay on and my daughter could not put it on herself. I kept having to put it on for her. Last night the tray was just laying on the floor in front of the high chair and I decided it just needed to go back to Toys R' Us. We did not have the box any longer (since Santa brought it) and they were going to make me get another one and I explained that we did not want another one. They gave me the money back and we will look for something else. I wouldn't recommend that anyone purchase this as it will only make your child very frustrated.I really wish that Little Tikes still made a high chair. My older daughter has that one and it still looks great. Fisher Price needs to work on something better."
2,does not stay together,"As others have said, the tray does not stay on. My child cannot get the tray back on and so I have to put it on several times a day. She also has trouble getting the velcro fasteners on over her babies so I have to do that too. In addition, it plays annoying music. I'd prefer a simple no frills high chair that she can use without my help."
3,Worthwhile for the serious history buff,"This book is in many ways an excellent analysis of America's first true military intelligence organization, and is chock-full of well-documented facts. Many of these are well-known elsewhere, but some analysis leads to new insights. Unfortunately, this book is poorly organized and difficult to read, almost painfully so at times. If you're really interested in the American Civil War or the history of military intelligence, this is a must-read. Unfortunately, it's far from a light bedtime book."
2,"Good information, painful writing","Fishel sure makes you work for the information... there's not a fact that isn't cited three, four or five times in following chapters. He does bring together much disparate information about the development of a military intelligence service during the Civil War, that's for sure. He has done excellent research, and argues his case persuasively. If he'd only had an editor, though, this massive volume would have come it at a third of its weight and would have been a better book. A serious lack was any discussion of military intelligence in the Western campaigns. Whether this is due to a lack of data or a lack of interest on the author's part is unclear... it just doesn't show up. If you're interested in precision on matters concerning the Civil War in Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania, this book has lots to offer. But brother, are you going to have to work for it!"
4,"Excellent, if exhaustive study of CW intelligence",operations. It really is a facinating book for the real history buff who has tolerance and maybe desire to really know all the ins and outs of how information was gathered in those days.
2,Not suitable for indoor use,"The look and feel of this camcorder is very good. Unfortunately my camcorder use is limited to low light indoor activities. For example, evening party, indoor school activities, kid drama and orchestra. This camcorder is not at all suitable for these activities. Earlier I had a Sony DCR TRV140, which was way better than this camcorder.This camcorder has a very small sensor and hence such a low price. One easy guide to evaluate the sensor size is to look at the optical zoom. Most of the camcorders with more than 10x optical zoom has small sensors. These large optical zoom camcorders will perform poorly in low light.If you are planning to use this camcorder in low indoor light, I do not recommend it."
4,Great Value,"If you are looking for an entry level MiniDV camcorder, the Canon ZR500 offers excellent value for money.Pros1. Very intuitive interface2. High Optical Zoom3. Use of joystick reduces number of buttons to just 3Cons1. Motor noiseIt also lacks a still camera mode, though I don't consider that to be a drawback."
3,Picture quality is average.,"Just average. I'm not a video expert, but I can tell you that the camera does not handle the interlaced video very well (opposed to other cameras I use). You can clearly see the even/odd rows against each other... On low light, the quality is fair, as you can expect on a camera at this price."
1,You are better off with a Elura 100,You are better off spending the extra money and buying the Elura 100. After trying 2 ZR500 we finally purchased the Elura 100. We discovered the following with the ZR500:Performs poorly under low light conditionsand Picture quality is very grainy
2,don't buy,"camera works fine, up to a point. Controls are marginal and you'd best have the manual handy to figure them out. However, I recommend you don't bother buying it, it is NOT moisture proof, or even moisture resistant, and the electronic control board will corrode with the slightest dampness such as filming in foggy weather or light rain. And you cannot dry it out inside."
1,Memories forever dull & lost,"Purchased this item at Best Buy in Florida during my vacation but the outcome was so dissapointing. Colors are very washed out, video to a 32 inch LCD TV is so blurry due to low resolution and low light b-day recording is sad as the TV turns dark and you can hear only voices. I highly recommend that anyone who wants to truely cherish their memories to get a higher grade camera. I really dont know what to do with this now... Too light for a door stop... Amazingly i have better results with a Sony Handycam I got as a gift in 1987. If you only have $250 to spend I suggest getting a used 2000-2002 High end model Sony with Night Shot."
3,Motor Noise and RCA output,"I purchased it last friday, and exchange it yesterday. I will find out if the replacement is any better as far as the motor noise goes. The motor noise is not the sound that I heard while using it, it's the sound being recorded on the tape. The sound ranges from humming, a fluorescent light post, to jungle.The RCA output is dull.I am happy with most of other features. One thing that I like (and I hope I am correct after reading the manual) is that it is electronic anti-shake.One more item, in easy mode, the anti-shake can not be shutoff."
4,Cute Little Camcorder,"This little camcorder was exactly what I was looking for. I am not a pro, and the Canon ZR500 is my first camcorder. The picture quality is good, and it picks up sound pretty well. Like some of the other reviewers, I agree that you can hear the motor when you play back what you recorded, but the sound is not as bad as some people make it out to be. I have small hands, so the controls are perfect for me, and the Canon ZR500 is pretty easy to figure out without the manual (though I will admit I did have to flip through it for a few answers). The only real disappointment I felt was when I realized that the camcorder did not come with a miniDV. Overall, I would recommend this product for a beginner."
3,CanonZR500Mini Camcoder,"Camera is light in the hand, sometimes too light for security feel of the camera. Camera when charged or used for length of time tends to over heat and feel hot to the hand. Toggle switch for play, stop, rewind, fastforward is difficult to use and flimsy. Down side - no hot shoe for external flash or level which is ""so so"" for a camcorder not essential; battery included with camera has about a 20 minute life cycle depending on video conditions.Optics are not as good in night shooting as anticipated.Postives are that one can video @ 720x480 with minidv tape, allowing for in computer editing in the most common video-editing programs possible - has 12 and 16 bit audio and is not just video destined for the web only! Also has external mic input. This was the main reason I went with this camera and not the ZR600, 700 or 800 (new) series."
4,a good camera,"I got this camera and love it, except for one thing. The microphone input jack does not work. So I am sending it back as I need this for an external mic. Everything else was better than expected. This zr500 has dropping prices right now,so now is a good time to buy. I can now get the zr830 for only a few dollars more than I did for the zr500.The zr500 does not have an usb connector so you'll have to use firewire, which cost me a few extra dollars. The zr600 I ""believe"" has the usb connection direct to your computer so I would say buy the zr600."
4,High quality on a budget,"The Canon ZR500 delivers superior quality sound and video, even in low light situations, when compared to other cameras in this price range. When covering an outdoor event, in a crowded situation, the compact size is a big plus. But I do wish they had provided a cold shoe mount for an add-on video light, I had to attach a special bracket to the tripod mount which was quite a handfull. And the tiny viewfinder that does not swivel can also be a negative. Full screen/wide screen is a great option, with more and more people owning wide screen TVs. Menu navigation is very simple using their new mini joy stick. 25x Optical Zoom is amazing!"
5,Excellent,I have this CD and mine has the following 2 tracks on it.Wait a WhileandSo Good RemixBoth tracks are excellent. It is a shame that the full-length CD with more tracks was shelved and not released.Ericka Yancey WAIT A WHILE CDEricka Yancey WAIT A WHILE [Single] CD
5,Good Product,I've used Contac for many years. My order arrived product and it works exactly the way I want it to.
4,old soldiers need to know,read this book to begin understanding why they defeated us in the field and in world opinion. ignore the anti communist BS introduction. plainly written increasingly hard to find.
5,A warning about filters,"I've had this camcorder since 2008, and I'm happy with it still. I have a warning for you if you're considering buying UV and/or polarizing filters - DON'T! I ordered a set, supposedly fit this camcorder, but they do NOT fit! I e-mailed Canon, they said it does not accept filters. After looking at the threads, I noticed they are not round! The sides are rounded, but the top and bottom are almost flat. No way to attach a lense or filter. Other than that, I'm happy with this camcorder. For indoor shots, I use a couple of Sunpak video lights, nice results (too bad they only work for about 15 minutes, and take 5 hours to recharge, but they were cheap). I paid a lot more than the price Amazon is now asking, but that was 2 years ago. So, if you want a decent camcorder for your home videos, this is a good choice. I never tried the included software, can't vouch for that. I use Linux, so it's no use to me anyway. I use dvgrab to capture the video, and Kino to edit and export to MPEG."
2,Good voices but unmemorable song,"Clint and Martina are wonderfully talented singers. Their voices go together well but the problem, as with many other duets, is the song itself. Ordinary clichéd lyrics and melody quite radio-friendly and hooky but unmemorable."
1,"Good start, unsatisfying ending","I was not expecting a James Bond thriller and found the setting in Jamaica to be very interesting and the characters interesting. Unfortunately by three quarters of the way through the book the plot seems obvious and the main character, Ian Fleming, looks increasingly unable to connect the dots to figure things out. The ending is very disappointing leaving almost everything unresolved. I will not be reading the next book in this series."
2,Death to Red Herring!,"Under a title alluding to Soviet counterintelligence (Smert' Shpionam), this thriller substitutes a shadowy megalomaniac. At the climax, our hero battles a henchman instead of the villain, leaving subplots and characters unresolved."
1,view of Death to Spies,"what a wonderful title for a book.and the cover art or photo make a book sale easier. but the hand holding a gun can't be seen well. and the small design at the start of each chapter very good.now to the story.which i find as boring as an old British movie.adventure NO.each character got worst as the story moved a long.i see why i had over look trying Quinn Fawcett books before now.and i'm very sorry i took the time to buy the set of Fleming stories,he has done.i hope the next will be some true format of a story.and at the last chapter he spoke of THE 39 STEPS.a book i just completed before this one.a truly wonderful book to read.but this was spoken as in a Hitchcock film.I think DEATH TO SPIES was very poorly done.and forgettable."
3,"Good Album, But Not the Klown's best","This is another great album by one of Long Beach's most prominent hardcore punk bands. I'm only giving it 3 stars because it's nowhere near as good as Holy Crap or Laughing Stalk. The mix isn't the greatest, the bass and drums are too quiet and the vox and guitars are too loud. Still a good album by all means, but buy Holy Crap 1st."
5,A fascinating author,"I find Ulf Morling being a unique and very interesting author. He makes the reader jump back and forth from serious and interesting happenings in our modern society to the fascinating world of magicians and mind readers. As a skilful journalist he writes about things like crime, drugs and prostitution in an extremely entertaining manner. When I started to read The Godmother I could not stop before I finished it. I hope to read more from Ulf Morling.Holger Wastlund, Management Consultant"
4,The Godmotheer,I have finished reading The Godmother. It is truly a masterpiece. Can't wait for the sequel. Roger Carlson mustlive on...........
2,Beware the deceptive track listing...,"I've been looking for some rare tracks and also the Barbara Ann recording for a while when I settled on this compilation; figured the import was a little pricey, but with so many tracks, it was worth it. There are 13 tracks and 3 medleys--all the remaining 25 or so tracks are snippets of the originals."
3,As self serving as it comes,"This collection of essays, I believe, would have made Burroughs and Kerouac and Ginsberg vomit. While they are well written and well-intended, they tend to be a little self serving, perhaps glorifying a moment more than it deserves. Surely On The Road deserves the acclaim it gets, but Kerouac's desire for a literary acceptance that he never realized is only amplified by these writings."
4,A great introduction to great literature,"I read ON THE ROAD over the recent summer and since then i have been interested in the beat generation and their style of life. This book is a perfect introduction for me, with detailed chapters on Kerouac, Ginsberg and Burroughs as well as other chapters on the beat generation asa whole. I haven't read it all; it's great to dip into from time to time."
3,Beating the dead beat horse,"So many Beats so little time. It seems every six months, someone rolls out another tome to this cadre of brilliant but admittedly over-marketed writers. Albeit, it's neither their fault nor intention, but how many more Beat Generation books do the powers that be think we need? Why doesn't Rolling Stone cover what's happening in contemporary American letters with authors like Daedalus Howell (novelist) and Trane DeVore (poet)? These guys are just as enigmatic as the Beats, yet Rolling Stone chooses to grave rob rather than expose younger talent. For shame."
2,"Cute rhyme, bad explanation","Our daughter is in a wedding and she's never seen one before so we decided to help her with books and things to let her know what's going to happen. This book seemed highly recommended, but I'm not sure if anyone really looked at it from this vantage point. The rhyme in the book is very cute, but it doesn't really ever explain what a flower girl is or does with the exception that she gets to wear a fancy dress. For an older flower girl this might be a cute keepsake, but not for her. I was disappointed with this book."
5,Cute bride gift for the Flower girl,Cute little book - made a great gift for my daughter to give to her flower girl as a gift.
2,Just Ok,"From what I saw in the preview this looked cute, but once receiving it I was pretty disappointed. The art is just okay and the writing is lacking creativity. Thank goodness my Flower Girl is young and wont notice because I would definitely be embarrassed giving it to someone older."
2,The Flower Girl,"Cute book, if all you are looking for is a simple poem. However, I would say less than average if you are hoping to really explain ""flower girl"" details, and processes to a little girl."
5,I love this book!,The photos are vivid and the stories are interesting. This is a great book to introduce children to some festivals and celebrations around the world.
2,Didn't fit right,"When I installed this hitch on my 03 Ranger Edge, it didn't fit right. It seemed like it was slightly bent or something. I finally managed to get it installed after messing with it for about 2 hours; however, it doesn't sit correctly (it's turned slightly sideways and isn't level)."
4,Do it yourself,Have used it twice to tow a camper....had a friend install it at work on his lunch break. Had to maneuver around my spare but installed it by himself. Saved a lot of money that way...
3,Tufoil,"I haven't noticed a difference in performance as of yet. I have a 2007 Tahoe with 75,000 miles in great running condition. I've just changed my oil and added Tufoil for the second time. My gas mileage is the same as before the treatment. It adds about $10 to the cost of my oil change, so I'm hoping for a positive outcome."
4,Pretty good product,"I too, was attacked by the mall kiosk worker, she was an excellent salesperson! She started at 49.99, I said no, then she said she would give me two for 49.99, I said no. Then she said, ok, I am going to cut all my commission out and give it to you for 24.99. And told me she could get in so much trouble for this, I had to keep quiet about it, ha.... Now, no, I don't believe that for one second, but I did think 24.99 was fair, so I bought it. It's a good product. I think they would get better business, and they would gain more respect with potential customers if they posted their price (the REAL ONE) and stuck with it. Give demos if requested, don't hunt down shoppers and grab their hands, buffing their nails before they realize what is going on.... It is a good product, and I will buy more when I run out, but not at the mall."
2,a $30 buffing block,"I also bought this after a hard-sell at a mall kiosk in LA. I was amazed by how shiny my nail was. I'm a guy, so I didn't know buffing blocks existed and could be purchased for 2 or 3 dollars.The buffing block is great. The lotion, file and cuticle oil bring the real value of this product to maybe $12. Do yourself a favor and buy a buffing block and save your cash. It'll look fabulous against your shiny nails."
4,pretty good,"I disagree with the other reviewer. It's true that the buffing block is great, but you can get equally effective buffers for much less. I found that my own buffing block didn't work as well anymore after only a few uses, which is why I gave the set only four stars. The cuticle oil is pretty good, however... and the lotion is the best part of the kit."
1,The company has no integrity,"I purchased the nail kit for $59.99 in the mall. I felt like that I was being ripped off, so I went to the mall to return the kit a couple days later. However, I was refused service. No salesperson had told me that I couldn't return the product once the purchase was made. No ""no return"" showed up on the receipt. On its website, the company states it promises to conduct business with honesty and integrity. If that is really what it claims, it should advise its customers that there is no return once purchases are made. Be careful on what you buy from this Isreali company."
3,"Not as bad as some claim, but not worth the price.","I was surprised when my husband came home with one of these, though not in the way he had hoped. I couldn't believe he'd fallen for the whole Seacret thing. While I don't think this kit it worth the cost here it is not useless as many folks claim. The lotion is the worst part, not very moisturizing. But the cuticle oil is packed with nutritive, natural oils and does make nails shiny. The buffer and file are good too. I agree with other reviewers who say you can buy similar items for less at a specialty shop. But this product isn't a total waste in my opinion."
5,"Silky smooth skin; shiny, smooth nails","The nail products do give a beautiful, glossy shine to my usually dull, ridged nails without polish. What keeps surprising me is how silky my skin feels after using the body lotion (especially my elbows). Maybe in a few weeks I'll get used to the new feel, but for now I'm still pleasantly surprised when I accidentally touch my legs or arms."
3,Buffer issue,"I have this product that I bought in a mall kiosk while on vacation and the buffer seems to have accumulated some kind of 'grit' that I cannot remove! It is gettng less efficient with each use. However, I agree that a similar buffer can be purchased separately at your local beauty supply store and I plan to buy one. However, I'm not going to give up my manicures anytime soon - since my manicures include an upper arm and hand massage."
2,Costly product for partial quality,"After reading some of the other reviews here, I'm guessing the authors have never before used cuticle oil or ever had their nails buffed professionally. The cuticle oil given with this product is basic, run of the mill, cuticle oil which can also be purchased in a beauty supply store. Same with the buffer. I bought the set and I agree that the products work well together. However, paying $60 for the kit is too much. Even paying $60 for two kits is overpriced.A basic beauty supply store (not a drug store or supermarket) would have the same quality products for much less. You're better off buying a good buffer and cuticle oil at a beauty supply store then purchasing a creamy lotion in the scent you prefer. You'll get the same results."
1,"Buffing block does work, but.....!","I too am always tormented at the mall kiosk. The last time I was there he tried to sell the set for $49.00 and when I refused, he very quietly told me not to tell anyone, but he would sell me 2 for $25.00. Sounded good, but thank God I am so skeptical I had to go home and check Ebay. I picked up 2 of the buffing blocks for $12.00 and I've only used them once and it is wonderful, but I guess per other reviewers it doesn't last long. I will definitely look for a cheaper version when mine don't work anymore. Anyway, after reading the other reviewers, they are a dishonest group and I will not give them my time anymore."
4,Wow Amazon's price is great,"Bought this for three for $108 including tax. The shop was selling them for 70 bucks a peice if you just got one. It does work REALLY well. I paid too much in my opinion, but the Amazon price is excelent. I highly recomend this item to both men and women. I'm a man and I've never had my nails look so good. Really they look very handsome."
5,UNBELIEVABLE,I just bought the seacret nail kit at the mall by one of those venders in the middle walkway. I just couldnt believe my eyes!! My nails have never looked so good!! Looks like I had a professional manicure. My nails are so healthy looking now. I sure wish I would of found this years ago. I have always had problem nails and cuticles. Well worth the money spent!!!
2,$49?!,I purchased this kit at the mall after allowing myself to be pressured by the salesperson. Nice products but not out of this world to ever dish out $49 again.
1,"Faulty design, Safety hazard","Insufficient clearance between front wheel and pedal. So when pedaling, if u turn wheel in any direction ,whatever foot is in the forward position ,it will rub against the front wheel ;thus creating a safety hazard. Otherwise its a great product at a great price"
5,very good,this is a very good book. my wife loved it. just like the title says taboo stuff in every story. to the people that gave it negitive reviews what did you expect from something that said taboo clearly on the front cover. pretty long book to. more stories than we expected.
2,Black folk's culture from a white woman's pen...,"The story is about black and white folks in their respective communities (and sometimes with eachother) in post civil war Arkansas. Initially I had a hard time keeping the various characters apart, and I had to make myself continue reading at times. The big event that connects everything and everyone is a tornado that kills some and whisps away others. The most intriguing character, perhaps, is the red-headed preacher's wife who is found dangling in a tree by her famous over-metaphorized hair. The black speech is at times interesting, although it feels somewhat artificial and too ""constructed"".Overall, it has the all-too-common feel of a white woman's rendition of black folk's culture and a very PC and feminine one at that (somewhat similar to the much more popular ""The Secret Life of Bees"" by Sue Monk Kidd). It amounts to subcutaneous chick lit - pleasant at times, but ultimately forgettable."
3,Slow but good,I bought this to understand what people are going through in Guatemala because of a missions trip we are taking. Slow but I am getting through it
4,Is he Canadian or Scottish?,"What can I say?After reading the previous reviews I was surprised at how highly rated Gowan is across the Big Briney.In Scotland no one has heard of Larry Gowan-what a waste!Imagine a more mellow Rod Stewart backed up by Peter Gabriel's band(Marotta,Rhodes,Levin)and you have 'Strange Animal'.Off-kilter backing and powerfully melodic songs help the album sidestep the morass of anaemic AOR.'Keep the Tension On','A Criminal Mind','Cosmetics'-all songs that reek of class without pandering to rules of generic pop.Pin-sharp hooks,lithe instrumentation- Recommended!"
4,Always loved this album...always will love it.,"This album was big on the Canadian music scene in the early eighties. There were two or three hits from it that made the top ten, and there was a reason to this...its a great album. Get it! Get it now!"
2,Creepy...This guy gives me the heebee geebees!,"Strange Animal is his ""best"" album - this doesn't say much. It's best summed up this way - a creep on a piano. If this guy were a TV show I would have to make him a Soap Opera, it's that bad!P.S. The extra star is only because he's Canadian I'm sorry to say..."
3,great,this was a great movie.. I love the plot of the story that was being told.. I just hate all the singing lol..
4,Good Message!,This play leaves you with the needed message of forgiveness to release your past to take hold of your present.
1,Don't Buy,"I brought this play after reading some of the comments but, I really should have listen to the person who said don't waste your time. They were corrected this play was horrible. The person who read this play or products. Please don't quite your day job."
1,Don't waste your time!!!!!,I bought this play thinking it was going to be great. Well it wasn't. I got bored 2 minutes into this play. This play was supposed to be happy and joyous since it's about Christmas. It left me sad and mad that I bought it. Whatever you do PLEASE!!!! Don't waste your time buying this play. O! The songs in this play aren't any good either. The CD has only 2 songs on it. That CD was not even worth buying this play. I thought that since they had Ruben in the play they'd have lots of singing in it. NOT!! This was really a waste of my money. Buy it at your own risk. You won't be able to say I didn't warn you. Now I know why I haven't heard Ruben Studdard or Golden Brooks talking about this play when they do interviews. If I were them I wouldn't either.
1,"DISAPPOINTED, NOT GOOD","THE PLOT WAS GOOD, BUT THE SINGING WAS WAY OFF. EVEN RUBEN WAS NOT UP TO PAR. THE COMEDY WAS A LITTLE TIRED. I KNEW THIS WOULD NOT BE A ""TP"" WHEN I PURCHASED THIS DVD, BUT IT JUST WASN'T ENTERTAINING.O THE BONUS CD,DON'T BOTHER. THERE'S NOT ENOGHGOOD SINGING TO BE PUT ON A CD."
2,the perfect gift,"it was okay, clarity was good,just did not care for the movie content. It arrived very quick. Thanks so much"
1,unhappy,"this product was awful, I don't know what I expected but I was not pleased with this at all. The dvd nore the sound track was worth the money and I want to give it back and get something else I will never give it to anyone to watch"
4,A great book for a lover of Religion,"This book focuses only on the affects of religon in an Apache society. The author, Claire Farrer, uses first person encounters to discribe rituals and the society surrounding them, not facts written fifty years ago. It is very lively and not at all what I expected for an Antro. class. I would reccomend this book to anyone who loves Native American history."
3,That's one l-o-n-g breakbeat,"I found the majority of tracks on this CD to be seemingly fairly simple breakbeats with a few stabs and licks of guitar, horn or keyboard thrown in. Although each track is competent and some of the later ones do stand up on their own, generally there is not enough meat on the tracks. (My girlfriend said it almost sent her to sleep whilst driving!) For a better example of this trip-hop style check out Morcheeba, or Rae and Christian, or Lamb, or Massive Attack, or..."
5,The Best Rock Music You Can Buy,"This 4 cd box set is a display of the best rock music of the last 10 years. It's really heavy while pulling you in with wonderful melodies that you'll constantly be singing afterwards. It may be pricey but it's worth the money. Quite simply songwriter, Ginger, is a musical genius and deserves recognition."
4,Good Introduction to Liturgical Worship,"This is an excellent start for those investigating liturgical worship in the Christian Church. It does tend to be slanted toward the Roman Church omitting several Anglican similarities. For example, Rosary is listed as specifically Roman even though it's use is widespread in the Anglican (Episcopal) Church. Under the heading Books of Worship, the breviary is listed as used in the Roman Catholic Church omitting the Anglican Breviary as well as the Anglican Missal. In the procession, the boat boy (boy who carries the unburned incense)is not mentioned and under clergy there is no mention of a Canon who is fairly common in the Anglican Church. There are other omissions and not much detail about the Orthodox tradition, however, most major subjects have been covered and provide a begining for those interested."
2,For die-hard Kelly fans only,"Despite the stars in the cast, this is ultimately disappointing. Granted, one doesn't usually watch this kind of all-star musical for the plot, but even so, this is especially weak on characterization and narrative drive. The stars are all concentrated in the last half-hour, and some of them are fun to see; actually, the best bit is Mickey Rooney doing impressions of Clark Gable and Lionel Barrymore (and his Barrymore is dead on!). Getting to the end, however, is tedious. The wartime romance angle is routine, spiced up only by some probably unintended Oedipal tension between the girl (Kathryn Grayson) and her father. Gene Kelly is energetic, charming, and sexy in one of his earliest roles, and he's about the only reason to watch this movie."
4,And I Want Uncle Sam !,"""Thousands Cheer"" is one of those many morale building movie musicals released during World War II. A little plot, a lot of color and everybody on the lot showing up to entertain us. This movie should be on DVD in a ""Hollywood Goes To War"" set, along with ""Hollywood Canteen"", ""Stage Door Canteen"", ""Thank Your Lucky Stars"",""Reveille With Beverly"", ""Jam Session"" and wouldn`t it be nice to have a non-bootleg ""This Is The Army"" ?"
2,Thousands cheer--when it's finally over!,"With a cast like this, I thought how they go wrong? Well, they managed! This movie goes on forever, with a plot that's predictable from the first few minutes, yet keeps dragging on and on. The only relief is Gene Kelly's dance routine with a mop, but otherwise there's little that's even musical about it. Be prepared to fast forward to the real entertainment, which is about an hour and half into the movie. During a ""show for the soldiers,"" the film makers bring on a huge cast of stars who all have brief songs or scenes. Lena Horne is beautiful as always singing ""Honeysuckle Rose,"" Red Skelton does a pretty funny skit, Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney, Lucille Ball, Gloria de Haven, and June Allyson are all right, and Virginia O'Brian is wonderful. Unfortunately, except for these few numbers near the end, it's not worth watching, even for major Gene Kelly fans."
5,Be thankful for what you have....,"Although Tammy suffered a terrible loss, I have to admit I find it a little hard at times to feel sorry for a woman who had the ""perfect"" man for 15 years of her young life, when other women (including me) have never even come close. Be thankful for the love that you had, and that you will have. Many women have never experienced anything close to that kind of love, ever, their whole lives. Many women have been alone their whole lifes. Tammy is only experiencing something that many other women have experienced. Life is not perfect, so be thankful that you had something so perfect, even if only for a seemingly short time. That is the lesson to be learned. We have all suffered, but God will get us all through it if we trust Him."
5,Awesome Story and Testimony!,"What an awesome story and testimony of how someone can not only survive a tragic loss but also keep a positive outlook on life and encourage others! Tammy Trent is a wonderful singer and speaker, but reading her story makes her that much more inspirational. I can't imagine someone reading this and not being touched by it. It will make you stop and thank God for the people you love - and not take a moment with them forgranted."
5,Heartache and Life,"I was blown away by Tammy at a conference and I had to know more about this incredible lady, so I bought this book. I loved it, the real emotion behind every word and the pain that this woman went through is beyond my imagination. I could not put it down until I'd read every page. What a blessing and God send Tammy is to women everywhere. The courage and love for God that she exudes at Women of Faith conferences make this a ""must read""."
3,great pictures - little explanation,"This is a typical Dover clip art book, with lots of illustrations haphazardly placed throughout the volume. There is a brief explanation at the beginning, and then you wonder what these pictures are all about. Most of them derive from Wm. Henry Pyne's ""British Costume"" of 1805, which was beautifully reproduced in full color seven or eight years ago for a very cheap price. The Dover book is OK, but if you want to know more about the subject matter then you should look for the other book."
1,skip this,"It's often pointed out that autobiographies are to a considerable extent works of fiction. It's less often pointed out, but equally true, that biographies are also to a considerable extent works of fiction. ""Frank LLoyd Wright: A Biography"" is a case in point. Now, it just so happens that the author of Frank Lloyd Wright's AUTObiography was a great artist, and it shows not only in his archecture, but also in his stylish, accomplished and original handling of English prose. This BIOGRAPHY, on the other hand, is dull, drab, and perfunctory, and its information is second-hand (at best). If you're going to read fiction, I say read GOOD fiction.Also: I've read a number of biographies of composers, and I find that they are almost always written by professional musicians. It seems to me that a biography of Frank Lloyd Wright ought to have been undertaken only by someone with a professional knowledge of architecture."
5,Great but Flawed Genius,"FLW is certainly the great man of architecture in the USA,but as a human being he had few redeeming qualities. Hecharmed his way through life, unable to ever live withinhis means. Who needs two grand pianos? How many buddasdo you have to have? He lived life on a grand scale becausehe acquainted it with a neccesity for a happy life. He was adriven man. I think Meryle Secrest recounts all this and morein her wonderful biography."
3,An Okay Bio,"This bio falls into the trap of many bios that I've read, way too much minutiae-not enough focus on what is important. Mr. Wright never comes to life as a human being. This creator of beautiful buildings comes off as a caricature of an architect. I know he was a self-serving, self-promoting, narcissist-but how did he manage to create great buildings? Maybe the writer herself didn't understand how this rather silly man created great buildings. After reading this book I know that I didn't."
3,"Great CD, NOT!","When saw the title Larry Heard Dance 2000, I thought this is a must have CD, and the customer reviews were 5 stars, so I was like, ""yeah, this I gotta get"".I was hoping it would be mixed and blended, but it wasn't. I can understand this being good for DJs, because they can mix the tracks into their compolations, but for a listener, this kills the groove. The title says Dance 2000, so that's what I expected.Also, it was way too techno for my liking. I am partial to the soulful sound I hear in House Music, which techno almost always misses.The only reason I gave this CD 3 stars is because of Larry Heard. I know that Larry is one of the pioneers of this music from Chicago, and maybe he was trying to capture something.This is cool, but keep the soul. The all electronic sound doesn't bother me, but give me more soul.Either way, I will listen again and let you know if there are any changes in my opinion.Larry, keep doing your thing.Peace!"
4,Kitty doesn't like,"... Take care when using so you don't choke your cat, but definitely keeps you from getting bit when grooming an uncooperative cat.... I usually use the muzzle to keep a cat calm and still, while I get them in the ""Cat Sack"", which gives you more control during bathing or clipping, and then remove the muzzle, but that depends on the cat. Some are more docile when they can't see.... I gave four stars because it didn't seem to go on that well, and could come off with a willful cat."
2,Anti fog cleaner leaves fog.,Cleaner leaves a film on glasses requiring a polish with a clean cloth after cleaning.
1,"Yes, it really does leak.","I can fix just about anything and have tried unscrewing the spigot, turning the washers around, using hose washers, etc., but it still leaks. I might try to buy a different spigot, but I'm not sure I want to waste anymore time or money on it."
1,$40 bucks?,"I bought two of these these summer....same exact product, same size for less then $3.00 each, and that is about all they were worth. I think you could do a lot better for $40."
4,Leaky spout easy to fix,"I have owned a number of these, and yes the spout always leaks the way it comes from the store, but there is a simple inexpensive fix.And I can tell you from experience, unless you are willing to pay a whole lot more for a heavier glass version they all leak.So go to the garden section of any store and pick up a packet of garden hose rubber washers.Unscrew the spigot. Place a washer on the spigot. Thread it back through the hole in the glass pitcher. Place a second washer on it inside the pitcher. Screw back on the nut. Make sure it is screwed on snug, but not too forcefully.Now fill the pitcher with water and set it on a towel or paper towel to test it. The leak should be gone.Enjoy your pitcher!Patti from Texas"
3,Jarden Beverage Jug,"I ordered one jug, but they charged my credit card for two.They also charged for two shipping charges. It took several phones call to this company to get this resolved. When they finally credited my credit card for the jug, they didn't credit the second shipping charge. I had to make another phone call to get this resolved. I would not do business with them again. Just go to Wal-Mart and buy one."
1,price incorrect,"This item goes for under $10 on most web pages. The price listed here is 3 to 4 times higher than elsewhere. Just enter ""Jarden Sun Tea jar"" in google and see the many options. Not sure why this price here is so high."
1,sun tea maker,WE MADE TWO BATCHES OF ICED TEA IN OUR MAKER. WE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY IT WAS LEAKING BUT FIGURED MOST OF THEM DO HAVE SPOUT PROBLEMS. MY HUSBAND FOUND A CRACK FROM THE SPOUT UPWARD SO OUT IT WENT. ALTHOUGH THE INSTRUCTIONS SAY TO ADJUST THE SPOUT WE NEVER TOUCHED IT.
1,NO Response,I had a problem with the container leaking and wrote them and I didn't get an answer. SO it just sits here not being used. Poor communication
3,2 locks - keyed alike,"I have two Gorilla Guards. they work well and I like them a lot. However, I bought them 3 years apart and I found out completely by accident that they happened to be keyed the same. Has anyone else run into this issue? I want to make sure anyone that happens to have a Fulton Key can't just walk away with my trailer."
1,Cut out is deal breaker,Unit cuts out with pause in conversation. This means you constantly tap phone or blow into it to keep unit running. Trashed it.
1,Junk,"The product didn't work, pure and simple, on my phone, installed exactly per the instructions. Lights up (so the battery's good) but there's no difference in the sound level."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I purchased this adapter to produce more volume for my phone, but what's not listed on the tech specs or product information on their website is that this adapter requires a special telephone cord connector that's REALLY difficult to find. What you need is a 4-pin connector, but not just any 4-pin; you'll need a non-standard, smaller, and narrower one to insert into the adapter. Radio Shack doesn't carry these in stock, unless you want to buy the cord and the connector separately and then crimp your own cord (I would not recommend this unless you like electrical hobbies).If you can find a non-standard 4-pin telephone cord (smaller, narrower size), you're in luck. If not, I surely hope you don't wast $5 returning this like I am! Buy the Ameriphone instead."
2,Didn't work,"I did read reviews before purchasing this for my mom's phone, as she is hard of hearing, but thought I would take a chance that it would work. Once installed, it had alot of static, and the next day, the battery was already worn down.I elected not to return, due to cost of returning, and no guarantee that I would get my initial purchase price back. Seller indicated that if they determined it to be not defective, no refund, they would just return it. I understand that, but regardless, it did not work on the phone we tried to use it on.Maybe it depends on the phone you use it on. I was aware that it will not work on phones with keypad in the handset, which this was not."
1,Phone amplifier,"We bought this for my father so we could cprrespond with him on the phone as we live a long distance from him. He has very poor hearing and this did not work for him, all he heard was noise. It may work for others who do not have serious hearing impairment but did not work for us."
1,JUST DIDN'T WORK FROM THE GIT GO,"THE AMPLIFIER NOT ONLY DIDN'T WORK WHEN CONNECTED TO MY PHONE, BUT IT CAUSED ALL THE OTHER PHONES, IN MY HOUSE, TO NOT WORK. WHEN DISCONNECTED, THE REST OF THE PHONES IN THE HOUSE WORKED NORMALLY."
3,Simple Amplifier,"The ameriphone amplifier works ok, but does not provide the sound that I need to hear with clarity on the telephone. My office just installed a new, I think it is called, ""Siempro"" telephones and they have this new booster that is really loud and clear. With the ameriphone I have to put the volume almost all the way to the end, but with the booster at my work I keep the level at 2. The level at work goes all the way to 8. So you can imagine how loud the booster really is. I want to see if I can purchase a booster that I have at work for my home phone."
2,3 day battery life,"I purchased the HA40 telephone amplifier from Amazon and it cam with a 9 volt battery. I put the battery in and it was working great on a Friday. Well come Monday morning, it was dead, so I figured the battery was old so I got some durcell (5 year) batteries. I put a new battery in and now it is Friday again and it is dead again. So a brand new battery lasted only 3 days since I put it in on a Tuesday. It has a boost button with a light and that light stays on all of the time. I suspect someting is wrong with this unit. I have emailed Amazon to see if they will replace the unit. I guess we will see what results I get from them."
1,Didn't Work For Me,"There are a lot of 5-star reviews for this product, but it didn't work for me. My wife is very hard of hearing. We have one Clarity phone with bass boost, and she loves it. So, I thought I'd try this amplifier instead of buying another amplified phone system. This way we could use it at home and easily take it with us if we traveled anywhere. There was incredibly loud feedback when the phone was first answered. That could have been due to our DSL line, but with/without phone filter, it didn't work. Also, in order to use the ""boost"" function, the button has to be pushed and held down while listening and then released when talking. It eliminates background noise by shutting down the telephone microphone, so the hard of hearing person has to keep their thumb on the boost button--press, release, press, release--throughout the telephone conversation. Kudos to Amazon for their return policy."
