4,Daughter likes it !,"Our daughter at age 3 is obsessed with the alphabet and gets a kick out of this book, she loves the pictures and silliness."
3,"A great player, almost a great book","Buy this book if it comes up at a low price or as used. Great collection of attacking games. Keene provides adequate notes without enough depth, the biographic stuff is good and Stein really deserves the worshipful writing of his life, e.g. a great player whose is twice robbed by FIDE (chess bureaurocracy) of his shot at real greatness - i.e. to play for qualification to challenge for the world title. The games are all excellent (though Gufeld claims a few are not actually Stein's ?!) A great feature of this book are the two dozen short games at the end. However the book that Stein deserves is still unwritten. This book fails to cover his positional style, endgame play, the full extent of his will to win and opening influence. This work is better than nothing, rescues the memory of of a chess genius of the 60's and is readable for all classess of chess players - the games are very imspiring. Keene's decent job should have been better."
5,Smellrific,"212 is a woody floral musk with a somewhat metallic soapy-clean opening which dries down to a very nice, musky clean base. The opening notes are a little strong at first. So much so that I avoided buying it because of the stronger opening notes. However, I brought the test strip home, and it sat on my kitchen table for a couple of hours to dry down. After the dry down, the middle and base notes opened up (which took 30-60 minutes), and everybody in the house was like, ""whoa! That's starting to smell really good!""I more than agreed, and had decided to return to the store within the hour to buy the 100ml bottle.I would say 212 is best for everyday use by a young, modern male, but it's not sucn an overpowering masculine scent as to preclude females from putting some on. I would also say it's a better fragrance for the office, as opposed to a date or formal occasion. All-in-all, it's one of my favorites, and it's one I get complimented on a lot."
3,Smells like urine,"My father says this smells like urine.To me, it smells woody, grassy, with a squirt of number 1."
3,Great sound for the price,"I have owned this guitar for almost four years, the sound, frets and integrity of the neck hold up well. Never had any fret buzz, or any problems with neck twisting. It stays in tune very well... surprised me actually. It has quite bright sound, not good for every sound, but I won't be getting rid of it."
5,Ennis's Debut is a stunner,"Readers of Ennis's Preacher should read this - it has all the blasphemy, religion, hedonism, and gut wrenching intelligence of that series but with a different backdrop."
1,Do I Have To Give It One Star?,"I anxiously awaited the arrival of this publication and could not have been more disappointed. I've been collecting police patches for 27 years but am always ready to learn more about the hobby.The Pocket Guide measures 4"" x 8 1/2"" with large print. It is 45 pages long - 39 pages devoted to police badges; 6 devoted to police patches!There are no pictures of patches, no prices, no sources - it is clearly not a ""guide"". Two pages are devoted to ""Patch Syles"" with listings such as, ""CIRCLE - This patch is round in shape and also a popular style""....In all fairness, if you are a badge collector, you may find the book a bit more valueable - but just a bit.The Pocket Guide is a glorified pamphlet, hardly worth its... price tag. It ranks as number 478 on my ""Books for the John"" list. And I was generous!"
1,I was disappointed.,"Well, I was disappointed when I opened up the parcel and took my first look at this booklet. I guess I was expecting a little more. The booklet is thin, even for a pocket guide. It only has two pages that are pictures of badges, and these are only in black and white. The best part of the book is the list of badge hallmarks. However, there are no nice pretty pictures showing what a real hallmark looks like with arrows showing where to find it on a badge. Maybe the list of references in this pocket guide will help me find the kind of book I am looking for."
1,Waste of $ and Time,Nothing much useful for wild plant uses but alot of quasi-spiritual mish mash. Don't buy unless you want some expensive firestarter for your fireplace.
1,Not a Premium Brand,"Eukanuba is sold as a premium dog food, but it is not. One of the main ingredients is corn which dogs are unable to process. All it did was make my puppy sick. For the same price we bought Blue Buffalo which is all natural and has no corn. Dont waste your money on a product that is no better than what you find in the grocery store for half the price."
4,Who&#65533;d thought we use so many phrases written by Shakespeare?,"I wasn't all that sure until I read ""Brush Up On Your Shakespeare"" by Michael Macrone. Did you know that ""Such stuff as dreams are made on"" is from The Tempest, spoken by Prospero? Or ""Wild goose chase"" was said by Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet? Well, now you do! This guide to William Shakespeare's most famous words and classic phrases are now in one entertaining guide. Listed by the phrases themselves, with in-depth explanations as to its original meaning and how it was used back in its time. Macrone also includes in the back, some ""Household Words"" coined by the famous Bard and ""Faux Shakespeare: Phrases Often Misattributed to Shakespeare"".People have used these expressions in everyday interactions as well as in the media. The book is even sprinkled with delightful illustrations by Tom Lulevitch. This guide is an easy way to learn a bit more about Shakespeare, for just about anyone."
4,Koihime & Muso,"Before Hua Mulan, before Wu Zetian, China bore another great hero, one whose true name was lost to history... until now. Swearing vengeance after bandits destroy her family and village, a girl named Aisha takes the Kan'u and sets forth on a journey that will take her across the ruins of a great nation living not as a woman ""should,"" but by the strenght of her own sword and the steel of her own will. And as she travils, her courage and example become a beacon to other kindred souls: women who dare to shatter the shackles of ther own traditions and take up arms, to become a force for change. Now, as a new world begins to emerge from the embers of the old, the face of evil must confront tis ultimate nemesis, a girl who has become the soul of a new people. An epic battle for the fate of a nation will be unleashed in the complete epic colletion of Koihime Muso! Its inglish subtitle"
4,"Useful guide, not complete, a few mistakes, more pricey than I'd hope","This contains very useful information such as water depths of the body of water, GPS coordinates, launch sites, and access roads. It also includes general fishing locations recommended for particular fish and fish stocking information (although may not be latest information), in addition to other information such as surface area and maximum depth. I have found one instance of the GPS coordinates being incorrect, and at other times the water depths weren't as detailed, but overall I would recommend these guides. The next best thing if you don't have a friend who lives local to the lakes and knows them like the back of his hand. Unfortunately, if someone were to collect all guides for all regions in Michigan, it would become rather pricey. A handy reference to have when you may be headed toward shallower water. When used with a GPS unit, you can feel like you know how to find your way around the lake."
5,RIVER WALTZ IS SO PRETTY IT'S RIDICULOUS,"THIS WHOLE CD IS SMOOTH JAZZ PERFECT, AS THE OTHER REVIEWERS HAVE APTLY INDICATED. RIVER WALTZ, HOWEVER, MAY BE THE PRETTIEST CUT THE 'JAX EVER MADE, IN MY OPINION. AZURE MOON IS VERY TIGHT, ALSO.RIVER WALTZ IS INDESCRIBABLE...JUST PLAY IT. IT LILTS, IT DRIVES, IT SOOTHES, IT CARVES IMPRESSIONS ON THE BRAIN AND HEART THAT YOU WON'T SOON FORGET. THE SAX LINE IS UNREAL.AZURE MOON IS A REAL-CLOSE, RAZOR'S EDGE 2D PLACE IN BEAUTY. MAYBE YOU'LL LIKE IT BEST. I LOVE BOTH OF THEM, AND THE REST OF THIS CD. THIS MAY BE THE LAST TRULY LANDMARK CD THAT THE YELLOWJACKETS HAVE TRACKED. IN MY OPINION, THEY PEAKED RIGHT HERE, BUT THEY STILL REMAIN A VERY TALENTED GROUP."
3,"Well done, perhaps, but rather too ""smooth"" for my taste","In the interests of full disclosure, I'm not really a fan of ""smooth"" jazz, so I guess it's not surprising this collection didn't impress me very much. My favorites were those that were a little more energetic and adventurous, particularly ""Dewey (A Tribute to Miles Davis)"" which was perhaps the only track where the sax player really cuts loose. ""Memoirs"" is stodgier rhythmically, but features one of the more memorable melody lines from this release. The sax carries the lead for most of these tunes, but there were some fine solos: from guitarist Haslip on ""Man Facing North"", trumpeter Hagans on ""Suenos"", and the pianist on both ""River Waltz"" and ""Sandstone"". A bit over-produced and certainly over-cautious for my taste, but hey, jazz puts up a mighty big tent, so if this is your thing, by all means enjoy. I'll be putting something meatier on."
4,The Story of Christmas,"I haven't seen this show since it first aired..it was a pleasure to see this show again. Each segment was good, but I think the one with the donkey was the most fun. The annimation for the Nativity was interesting in its simplicity."
2,TINY!,This is cute- but TINY! The pitcher is perhaps 3 1/2 in tall and the glasses about an inch and a half. (almost shot glass size) Just be prepared for a mini version of what you may be expecting. Not worth $13
2,Weak offering by otherwise great artist.,"After reading the other reviews, I had to write a review for this CD. I am a long time David Benoit fan, but I find this CD the least enjoyable Benoit CD that I own. It is a significant departure from his other work. The music is much more paced and sombre. There are songs I like on this CD, but when compared to earlier offerings like: 'This Side Up', 'Every Step of The Way', or 'Inner Motion', this CD is disappointing. Save your money and buy 'This Side Up' (his best work) instead!"
2,Very Thin Fabric,This costume is very cute just be prepared for the extremely thin fabric. I would pick a different costume if you have a kid that is rough on clothing.The sizes do run small except for the hat it fit my head and it does not come with a strap.If you are looking for a size comparison the 2T fits my 13 month old who has an 18in waist is 32 inch tall and weight 23lbs.
1,AMAZON delivered but the costume company is LACKING!!!,"Very disappointed!!! Ordered this two weeks before Halloween. Got it in the mail after about 5 days, and the package was marked medium but contained a small size costume. So AMAZON graciously over-nighted another costume to me. It arrived the next afternoon! But unfortunately this time the hat was a size Medium, but the dress was still a size small! Someone at Rubies is not paying attention! And now I have no costume and a VERY sad little girls only 5 days before Halloween. Kuddos to amazon for their customer support, but would not recommend this costume company!"
4,"Interesting music, Really liked it...","I first heard of this group when I was watching this tv program titled Rojo Fama/Contrafama on TVN. They performed on the show and I was impressed. I had a friend's mom purchase the cd for me in Chile and she brought when she visted. I really like two songs the best, ""Rapa Nui"" & ""Navegando, Navegando"" although I have to admit I like the remixes better since they are faster tempo and would kill for maxi-singles of the songs with lots of remixes if they were available. I recommend this cd if you what to hear something different."
3,Gift,The delivery went as mentioned on the website but the product size was even smaller then mentioned.As a kid i had the same pendant ( that got stolen last year ) and it was even twice the size then these bought online.A pitty really since i bought 2 for our 8 years relationship`s celebration ( and we are in our late 30`s now ).They could have given a more precise measurement besides the option between small and big.Besides that the product is correct in quality and finishing.
4,small bear claw,item arrived in an excellent time frame. It was well presented and in perfect condition. Thankyou.
2,This is NOT for a cross-platform audience,"This book has some great content; however, as a Mac user, I was disappointed that nowhere does the author point out cross-platform differences. I realize Windows is the dominant OS, but Acrobat is just as much (if not more, as a a percentage) used on the Mac. Shame on the author for not even bothering to mention the differences."
3,Not for Macs,"This is not a bad book, but it's mistitled. It should be ""How to Do Everything with Adobe Acrobat 7.0 for Windows."" It ignores nearly all differences in the program and procedures for the Mac version, and nowhere does it warn you of this. Hello? Anyone home?"
1,"Does not fit 1998 Audi A4 V6 2.8 L, despite what they promise","So, you enter the car make, model and year and Amazon tells you that this 'fits your vehicle' don't be surprised that it doesn't.The cables should come off at a 90 degree angle from the coil but these don't and will be too short. There is no way you can make this work on a 1998 Audi A4 Quattro Avant, 2.8L V6."
4,One Of the Best Pre-80's Anti-Appartheid Film!!,"It amazes me that so little attention has been paid to this witty adventure-drama. Created and made long before anti-apartheid struggle bacame ""vogue"" in the mainstream culture in mid-80's, it was rare insight that gave us the sinister faces of the dreaded South African sercret service, the ""BOSS"". Remember this was made long before ""New South Africa"". Long before the release of Nelson Mandela. Before Soweto and Biko murder!!"
3,More Defiant Ones,"Admirable attack on the hateful South African regime of the 70s is couched in a picture that's more caper than political thriller. The two leads are good, but seem to grapple with the film's jarring shifts in tone. Nicol Williamson is outstanding as the heavy and plays the self righteous Afrikaner with complete conviction and without any ironic commentary. (Like all his film roles he's intensely compelling, but has a distractingly awkward presence.)Worth watching and the picture does include what may be Sydney's hottest love scene."
4,Enjoyable & Relevant,"""Now you understand."" A thoroughly enjoyable movie that still is relevant concerning the racist conflict engendered by white supremicists. Well-made movie & who cannot enjoy the acting of Michael Caine & Sidney Poitier?"
3,Two great stars in an okay thriller,Sidney Poitier and Michael Caine are on the run in a good political chase thriller that has gone unnoticed over the years. The story is about a newly-freed black South African freedom fighter aided by a British engineer who flee sadistic police officials who hope their trail leads them to the resistance movement's leader. Nicol Williamson is great as the calculating state security agent on their trail and a young Rutger Hauer also appears but in a smaller role of a pilot. The scenes with rear-projection footage and Poitier's Bantu dialect don't really work but the picture is certainly worth a look.
4,Better than expected,"I found this book on the remainder table at my local bookstore. Right from the beginning, I was drawn into the novel. The plot twists are complicated and the characters rather numerous. Her description of the Scottish estate were good, and I liked the ancillary characters. I couldn't put the book down and was sorry when it ended. I expected the usual Regency Romance and found a much more interesting book. I'll definitely read more of Ms. Grant's books."
3,Too many elements to the plot,"Charles and Melanie Fraser are back in a sort of prequel to DAUGHTER OF THE GAME. Set in the Regency period, this book had everything you could possibly think of for that time period-espionage, games of seduction ala Dangerous Liaisons, adultery, incest, duels, murder, political intrigue, debauchery-you name it-this book had it. It was a intricate, twisting, turning, maze of a plot. Despite the cumbersome nature of the plot, it really did keep me turning the pages and for the 400+ pages, I nary skimmed a line.Luckily the author provided a family tree for the complex intertwining family relationships. I didn't count the characters, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were fifty of them. Sometimes it got quite confusing.This is a book that reads like a romance novel without the romance: intrigue was the emphasis. Charles and Melanie are very likable characters and I hope they will be back, but in a less rambling plot than this one."
4,interesting novel for teenagers,"Book review on the novel ''Dear Nobody`` by Berlie DohertyThe novel ``Dear Nobody`` deals with a difficult theme: the pregnancy of teenage girls.In the novel there`s Helen and her boyfriend Chris, who had sex and a month later Helenrecognizes that she`s pregnant. At that time she starts to write the Dear Nobody letters.[...]I would recommend the novel, because it shows very well the problems girls and women havewith an unwanted pregnancy. And the novel shows the helplessness of the girls and the of the membersof the family and necessity of a friend."
4,story from real life,"book reviewthe novel ""dear Nobody"" by Berlie Doherty deals with an unwanted pregnancy of a young woman.Helen and her boyfriend Chris have sex for the first time, but one month later Helen has an unsure feeling in her. After having done a pregnancy test and having gone to visit a doctor it becomes reality: Helen is pregnant![...]this novel can give young people who are in a similar situation feedback and hope to handle with and it helps them to take the right decisions. It deals with realistic problems of teenies and because of that it is very interesting to read and at some parts surprising. I would recommend it to every young woman and man who like reading stories from real life."
1,Boring!,"we read this book in school and i have to say, that this book is not that kind of book i want to read in my freetime!! or maybe the book wasn`t written for people like me. i really couldn't identify myself with the characters in ""dear nobody"", so i'm happy that this theme is over. it's not that i want to make this book bad, there are shurely some persons, which may like this book, even in my englischclass, but i'm non of them. at teh end i would say, that everybody should make his/her own picture of this book. you may like it!!"
2,"Not boring, not interesting","The novel Dear Nobody written by Berlie Doherty is about an unwanted pregnancy.This book deals with a very serious theme and shows the problem which you have, when you get pregnant.I can't say, that I don't like the novel, but it's a little bit boring, because everywhere you here something about that theme and the novel you don't get to know something new.But some party of the novel are interesting.Well, all in all, I can say, that it wasn't a waste of time reading ""Dear Nobody""."
2,Only for school-use.,"A few months ago we started to read this novel in our English-class. When I read the title first I have expected that it will be boring. But I've changed my opinion after reading. Well, it's not a thriller and a tension doesn't really exist but it's easy to understand and okay for German pupils. The only reason to finish the book is to know the relationship between the two main characters after the birth of their child. Some situations are quite interesting but unfortunately all action takes place in the thoughts of the persons. The book is not very amusing because unwanted pregnancy is a serious theme."
3,Good Read,It is a very special book with a lot of emotions. I think it is very hard for a girl if she is pregnant at this early age. But I think it is good that Helen wants the baby. It is better for her. The end of that book is very happy. The mother and the grandmother love the baby too. That is very good and calm. I hope that I will never be in that situation. I do not want to become a father at that age because I will enjoy my life. Berlie Doherty gives us such different views. She shows us what we don't have to do.
4,"good book, very thoroughly written without cliches","I like the book that is so well written that one can see and feel the characters change throughout the novel.I guess it is very hard to write about such a delicate subject without intruding into people's privacy too much. Doherty successfully does this, I believe. However, I' m not so sure if the fact that Chris is the main character in the book -instead of Helen- is believable; yet I like the idea of making him the main character so that young men feel it is also a book for them."
4,Dear Nobody,"""Dear Nobody,"" Helen's letters start. You may ask, ""who is Nobody?"" or ""Why is this Helen girl writing to someone who doesn't exist?"" The answer is that Nobody is 18 year old Helen Garton's baby, growing inside her. Nobody is Chris' baby too, and so when Helen breaks their relationship saying, ""I just need some time to figure everything out"" he is furious. This just adds to Chris' list of problems of passing his exams, finding and talking to his ex-mother, and making his desions about college. Helen also has many probems to deal with, like college, exams, abortion, and regaining her mother's friendship and love. Find out how Helen & Chris figure their complicated lives out by reading ""Dear Nobody"", a **** out of ***** star book."
5,It was a realistic down to earth book. It was so GOOD !!!!!!,This was an amazing story. It made me cry so many times I could not put the book down. I started to read this book for a report but it was so heartfelt. It was sad at the end when I thought that the boy was going to get back with her.That part should have been changed. But thats what makes the story the story. I thank you for writting a story as good as Dear Nobody.
2,too much..just too much,"We recently finished reading Dear Nobody..We managed to read the whole book, although it wasn`t so interesting. The book is easy to read and understand, but we felt that the letters were too detailed and they didn`t have a flow...We had to make a book report, therefore we kept on reading the book till the very end.The story was believable, these kind of incidents take place all the time. However, we feel that this book should be read by youngsters who are experiencing the same situation. All in all it was an OKEY book to read....;o)"
3,"Utalitarian, but quality not there...","The shoe needs to be ordered a full size up. I did, and the shoe fit perfectly. However, I was dissapointed with the quality. The fur was very weak. In fact, it was already bold on the back of the left shoe, and I have not even worn them! Also, the fur was poorly sawn in and splitting on the same shoe. Comfort was there. However, I could not envision being able to wear the shoe more then a few times before the fur would complately disapear, leaving a bold and tired looking spot. Not worth it!"
4,Feels great for as long as it lasts...,"This shoe feels great when on. Breaths so your feet don't get sweaty. Comfortable angle on the heel so great to wear for long periods of time. The only drawback, and it is not minor, is that the fur sheds very quickly. Don't expect to have any left on the back of the heels after just a couple of wearings. The top is more durable. They also run quite small. I wear a natural 8 and had to go up a full size."
4,Good book on Golf Basics,"This book is good for the typical beginner to the sport of golf. It gives some basics as to the type of clubs being used and techniques on how to swing a club. Overall, this book is good if you need a quick reference."
5,Enlightening Little Book,"This book was suggested to me by a colleague as I was starting to play golf. I found it to easy to read, follow and understand.This is a delightful little book that contains a wealth of useful and helpful information and golfing ideas for the novice with an interest in learning some basics about the beautiful game of golf. The book is packed with ideas that succinctly explains and describes the crucial golf tips that a novice golfer would be interested in knowing.As a novice golfer, I learnt how to avoid bad habits from the start. The numerous and excellent photographs and proven advice helped me to ensure that I make those hours on the driving range and putting green time well spent. It is straight and to the point with no unnecessary fluff and sets a good foundation for the beginner.The book is an excellent companion for the beginner that is well worth having."
5,Surprisingly Interesting,"Not being much of a Slipknot fan, I wasn't expecting much from this book. Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised. It's very in-depth in regards to how this band came to be & chronicles its success quite well. It provides a look into the their personal lives as well as their public persona. A sprinkling of the McIver trademark humor is always a good thing. Even though I don't much care for the band this is indeed a good read. I'm to the point now where I look forward to reading Joels books, no matter the subject."
4,good but..,"this book was great, but..it didnt show their faces enough if it did at all.if you want a movie that shows their faces through the whole movie (just about).. i know the perfect movie.The Knot Gone Wild.check that movie out.but anyway..the book was great. it kept me interested throughout the whole book. from the biginning of the bands' stardom to present day.if you're a Slipknot fan, you should definalty get this book."
2,Takes a lot to say a little.,"Wow- It's a good thing McRobert promotes minimum time in the gym and maximum time resting- because you will need plenty of time to read this book. I found much of it to be rambling and redundant preaching.This is a good program for a super skinny ""hardgainer"" or to alternate with other programs. But if you are an easy target for fat or trying to get cut I would advise against this program- simply not enough gym time. His diet advice is strictly for the skinny people. It is sure to get you fat in no time at all.I am really shocked this publication was rated so highly. Everything he needed to say could have been condensed to about 25 pages. Not worth the money or time. Simply google HIT programs or hardgainer routines/program. For diet purchase ""The Anabolic Diet"".And why are there no pictures of McRobert? We would like to see he practices what he preaches."
3,Some good advice,"I like his concept of abbreviated training, his focus on compound exercises, his emphasis on not believing that you can do the same as the elite can do and expect the same results. These advice alone are worth a lot for beginners, myself included.However: This book is not scientific at all, is filled with weasel words (""some say...""), repeats itself again and again. No evidence is provided for the claims of the author; he just says ""my and others' experience indicates"". Furthermore, parts of his book remind me of a self help book and a new age alternative medicine book. While not claiming that alternative medicine is bogus, I have to say that I was surprised by how much space he spent writing about these things.All in all: It's OK. 2,5 stars."
4,Provides good advice for young upstarts willing to listen :),"I had been planning on getting this book for a while. But I wasn't as impressed once I went through it. It is primarily a collection of solid old-school advice, most of which I, inadvertently or not, have embraced over the years. But it is still an excellent book for those who have stalled in their training and need to inspect their understanding of ""basics"". Regardless of your experience, however, pay particular attention when he talks about injuries and his surmises on how the few injuries he has had came about."
3,"Good book, but takes far too long to say too little","I bought this book six months ago and have been using it with the excellent companion volume, ""The Insiders Tell-All Handbook On Weight-Training Technique"" to good effect. The problem I have with this book is not the information contained within, but with how long the author takes to put it across. The book is 500 pages long and could easily be one fifth that. Don't get me wrong, the information here is GOOD, but it should have been the first hundred pages of the ""companion volume"" and not a separate text. But then the author wouldn't have as many books to sell...Worth it, but be prepared to slog through lots of unnecessary verbal padding to find the useful stuff."
4,"Recommended for every ""hard gainer""!","This is a great book for anyone interested in improving their physique, especially after failing in convential methods. However, the book will be sometimes hard to understand for anyone not previously exposed to weight training and familiar with a lot of the terms and procedures involved. Also, the author keeps stressing the need for correct technique throughout this book, but never gives details on technique for even the major exercises. In my opinion it is necessary to also buy ""Insider's tell-all handbook to weight-training technique"" by the same author to make full use of ""Beyond Brawn""."
1,BEYOND BORING!,"YO GIVE THIS DUDE A NOBEL PRIZE IN SCIENCE AND LITERATURE CUZ HE FIGURED OUT HOW TO SAY THE EXACT SAME THING IN A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS!!LIFT HEAVY, DON'T DO A LOT OF REPS, MOST BROLICK DUDES ARE JUICIN', EVERYBODY LIFTS WRONG BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH!!!THEN REPEAT THIS SENTIMENT FOR 400 PAGES AND YOU HAVE ""BEYOND BRAWN: THE INSIDER'S ENCLYCLOPEDIA ON HOW TO BEE ESS YOUR WAY THROUGH 400 PAGES AND GET PAID FOR IT!""100 PAGES IN AND I'M LOOKING FOR THE WAY OUT....ALL I'MA SAY IS I'M SORRY TREES SUFFERED FOR THIS."
4,wants to be big,"Over all this book has tons of usefull info. Everything is good untill the routine section, i guess its alright if u can SQUAT he assumes everyone can squat and doesnt really give much options if u cant. He says to use the trap bar deadlift instead of the squat but then in the routine sections he puts them on different days... leaves me wondering if i should do dead lift of both days or just work legs once a week? overall its a good buy u just have to figure somethings out if u have a bad back and cant squat."
5,Well worth it,"I've read many books on the subject of Weightlifting, Bodybuilding and Strength over the past 5 or 6 years. 'Beyond Brawn' has a very old-school feel and is likely one of the most informative that I've ever read on the subject of strength/size building. This book is a must-have!"
2,Disappointing,"As a big fan of Brawn I was looking forward to this book. Unfortunately Beyond Brawn has big drawbacks. Repetition is taken to the nth degree, it has a style which is difficult to read and it lacks any motivational qualities. Brawn and early issues of Hardgainer the magazine were very different.I would still reccomend buying Brawn and all Hardgainer issues up to around 1998 when the tone seemed to change with kids like Dahlin and Finander writing articles rather than experienced people like Tony Rose.If you have Mcroberts first book Brawn you have little need for Beyond Brawn."
5,The Book,"If you are not making much progress following routines promoted in muscle magazines and mass market exercise books, this book is for you. The book contains simple, practical information on every aspect of weight training geared toward genetically average, drug free trainees. There is only a handful of weight training books in print that I consider worth reading, and this one is at the top of my list."
2,Poundage progression is not the only way,"Stuart opens your eyes on what a typical drug free male can achieve in physical proportions; stating that an 17 inch arm is a terrific accomplishment for any drug free male. I found it very easy to add weight to my exercises, due to the long rest periods between sets and only one exercise per muscle group, but I often felt more like a weightlifter, than a bodybuilder, when I left the gym. I think he places way too much emphasis on how much weight is on the bar instead of talking about other important factors such as muscle control and the mind to muscle connection. Very good book on getting stonger in the big compound movements, but I don't find it very useful for the bodybulder in search of the training high, usually found when one trains at a fast pace, and uses multiple exercises per muscle group."
2,Worthwhile reading,"This is different training advice to the norm. No more and no less valuable than Arnolds. At the end of the day you are either born muscular or you arn't, the mode of your training has little or no effect on your progress. I have seen as many guys fail using Mcroberts advice as i have seen fail using Arnolds advice. As can be seen from the Hardgainer website most of the people showing their physiques are very unimpressive, certainly nothing more than you will find in a gym using exclusively Arnold style training.I think the important thing is never said - if you are born to be muscular then sure enough it will happen. For everyone who isn't, try Hardgainer training for a while, but don't expect to look like Arnold. Get used to that fact. You can increase your strength slightly but the talk of HG being some kind of foolproof way to success is just a marketing myth."
1,Waste of time and money,"I found this book and the first Brawn a waste of time. I'm sorry I wasted 3 years lifting using these techniques. This book will not do anything for you. You will not gain anything. Before you buy this book, you must ask yourself why the author never shows his face or physique. Why would you take advice from someone whose physique you have never seen before?"
5,Could be the only Bodybuilding book you will ever need!,"This book is fantastic.Stuart McRobert details the information you actually need to be sucsessfull in your training. After reading this book and tailoring my traing to its guidlines I put on 15 pounds of muscle in 3 1/2 months, and this is my 9th year training. Read Brawn as well, it is precise in showing the excersices to do, outside factors, ways to improve recovery.... This book made a positive change in my life, inside the gym as well as out."
2,Not what I expected,"I'd read on numerous weight lifting forums that this was the book to buy, but I was disappointed with it. It reads like an infomercial, promising the reader all of the wonderful and useful things it will provide, without ever actually getting to that point. I got through the first forty pages and finally gave up. I found Strength Training Anatomy to be much more useful."
3,"ABBREVIATED TRAINING, BUT NOT WRITING","After reading Beyond Brawn, I now believe even more firmly that abbreviated training with plenty of rest days is the way to go. There is plenty of good information here about performing exercises and designing routines. But unfortunately McRoberts did not apply this less-is-more approach to his writing. If the flab of repetition and filler were removed, the book could be reduced to half its size without cutting into the muscle. In sum: worthwhile, but not great."
4,Realistic book about mainly program creation for strength training,"The author repeats the fact that genetics play an important role in your strength training development a bit to often, but the program creation process is described really well. How to you plan your program, which exercises to use, how to periodize and how to keep growing is described very well. Although he forgets to mention that his training method only is about absolute strength and bodybuilding and not about power. And personally I don't use all the accessory exercises he advises."
5,The only bodybuilding book you will ever need...,"Stuart McRobert has written a book that applies to the 95% of the bodybuilders out there..those of us called ""hardgainers"". After suffering through years of failure because of reading books by genetically gifted and drug assisted champions, as well as following the instructions of local uninformed personal trainers, my body was battered and broken. After suffering a back and leg injury I was ready to give up. After reading this book and utilizing the sane and wise advice, I have excelled beyond what I had ever expected. If you love weights...buy this book!!!! You will not regret it! I wish I had it years ago."
5,Good Reading Fast Pace.,I like good fiction based on some true facts. Something to put your imagination to work.. Good characters and plot.
4,Great read for a rainy day.,"Robert Doherty has a great knack for interconnecting enough real events with his fiction to make you stay allert. A little bit like Tom Clancy but over a wider spectrum. There is authentic sounding descriptions of military hardware and procedures, and enough far out stuff to make even the most ardent UFOlogist feel at home. The combination somehow grounds what would otherwise be just conspiracy fluff with enough reality to make for a good yarn. (Exactly how did the Men In Black connect to both the Great Wall and secret bases in Antartica again? Area 51: The Reply has at least one possibility covered.) Highly recomended."
3,Formatting ruins the fun.,I read the ebook Area 51 on holiday and it is good fun once you suspend belief. Area 51; the reply in ebook is so full of format error it is so annoying as to be almost unreadable.
3,I was expecting more,When I discovered this series and read the reviews I thought that I found a series I could relate to. After reading the first two books I'm disappointed. A so-so book with a so-so story line don't think I'll finish the series.
5,Fascinating Follow Up!,"The action,mystery, and intrigue continues in this great second book in the series of three. I thoroughly enjoyed The Reply even more so than the first novel as Robert Doherty expanded on the alien phenomenon. This is well worth the time and money for those interested in the myth of aliens/UFO's. Here is yet another five star review to go along with the millions and millions of others from those who know a great book when they read one!"
4,Characters choppy,I liked the book but thought he skipped around without any introduction. Some characters just appeared without any notice and some just got lost.
5,Outstanding,"I have read both Area 51 and Area 51-The Reply and have found the books to be interesting, and very, very belivable. (I live in Nevada near the regions described in both books). I am patiently anticipating the release of The Mission. Keep the books coming."
4,Area 51: The Reply,A fun easy read and great follow-up to the first book. I ordered the third book immediately upon finishing this one.
3,"Good, but doesnt last",I have an 80 pound yellow lab. I got the compressed bones so they would last longer than the normal rawhide bones. After giving these to her they lasted about 25 minutes. That is much less time than the normal bone. My dog is a heavy chewer and had broken these into little pieces within minutes. The coating lasted about 3 minutes and the bone itself lasted about 15-20 minutes. Not recommended for heavy chewers.
2,.,"Not sure how I didn't notice this but this rawhide is made in China. It was my first time buying a compressed rawhide and it did last longer than a regular rawhide but definitely not long enough to justify the price. Plus, it is mad in China. I'll stick to buying these in my local store where I can check labels."
2,"1080i cable, not 1080p","I bought this because the picture on this site says this cable supports 720p/1080i/1080p, and a reviewer above says the cable supports 1080p, however, when I got the cable it only supports 1080i - so get a cheaper 1080i composite cable that will work just as well. That being said, the quality at 1080i is top notch."
3,Keeping Kosher in a Non-Kosher Worl,"This book presented direct, succint answers to any possible question that anyone would have about kashrut. The information is in a question-answer format. While you will undoubtedly find the answer to your question, you may not like the answer. The advice is very strict. You might to seek more lenient answers from your local rabbi."
1,This is NOT the item I thought I was ordering...wanted a stainless steel paper towel holder and received a chrome one...,"My wife and I wanted a stainless steel paper towel holder (brushed chrome) and received a shiny, chrome one...NOT happy campers!!"
4,Nice Wine Shelf,"I bought this shelf in black, and it definitely looks great on the wall. It was a tremendous pain to get the thing mounted, though -- so beware! Also, it seems a little iffy at times. We keep wine bottles on top of the shelf (glasses underneath, obviously) and it seems to get a little loose. I guess you probably aren't supposed to put bottles on top. Perfect for those with limited space for glasses, or who want them easily accessible for lots of wine drinking!"
1,A bad joke,"This could easily be the worst book ever published! That anyone has ever finished it would be a miracle. It's asif written by a simple-minded high school student. The plot is as predictable as it is silly. The characters are never developed, but,then, who would want them to be? There is absolutely nothing to hold one's interest although written by a ""world acclaimed author"" according to a blurb in the back. Then again Mr. Katz may be just that -- only as the worst writer of all time. A JOKE."
3,Decent book for cross training and injury prevention,"This book contains detailed explanations and images of great exercises that can be used to supplement running and prevent a lot of common running injuries. A great handbook to have at home if you are looking for help isolating and strengthening problematic, recurring injuries. That being said, it is a rather large book making it difficult to take with you to the gym, track, etc. Honestly, it is definitely worth it for any serious runners or runners who are coaching themselves. A great reference book.-from a serious, veteran runner and running store employee."
3,Buddha Boy Review Notes,"BUDDHA BOY BOOK REVIEW.This book is about the journey of a young man who goes from a defenseless nobody to a strong protective leader.The book was a dull read however it taught many lessons about high school and the life that many young people must read. It is no wonder that many children have difficulty in high school. There is a lot of pressure to conform.The good thing about the book, although I did not find it very interesting, is that it provides a lot of issues for discussion and different opinions."
3,Required litereature for high school.,"I am reviewing this on behalf of my teen who is entering high school. This was a requirement as part of an english course. According to her the book lacked interest and therefore was difficult to ""get into"" especially, to a teenager of this age. She didn't think the book was bad, but has read better. She also was thankful that the book was very short(about 14 chapters). The book seemed appealing to me, however, I did not read it, so I can only make comments based on her experience."
4,Buddha Boy,"In the novel, Buddha Boy, Kathe Koja describes the life of two boys in high school. Justin had never been popular, but he has always had two great friends. Everyone had been talking about a weird new kid at school, but Justin hadn't seen him until lunch that same day. A boy came up to him, and asked him for money, and that's when he got his name Buddha Boy. Justin becomes friends with Buddha Boy and starts hanging around him. Buddha Boy gets invited to a very famous art school, and has to make a banner for the school to use to make sure he's ready for the challenge. The day of judging comes but things go terribly wrong. In the novel, Koja teaches that everyone's different, but you should still accept him or her. Find out what happens in Buddha Boy."
1,Ugh,"This book is awful. The blurb makes it sound like a story of ostracism in high school, but the characters are cardboard-flat. It's more of a preachy spiritual trip for the author than a story. There's no reason for the narrator, Justin, to befriend the school outcast (who is a Christian-raised white boy trying to live as a Buddhist monk). The narrator's friends are bratty and too obviously shallow. The school bully is a stock stereotype who does all the predictable bully things. I got about halfway through and quit."
4,Buddah Boy; Thought Provoking,"Buddah Boy is a story about a boy going to high school who looks and acts different than the other students. Justin, the main character, has a hard time and struggles with what to think and how to act toward the new student, Jinsen. He also struggles with the reaction of his good friends to his relationship with Jinsen.I thought that this book was a good book to read when first entering high school because it was very realistic. I don't like to read but I thought it was a good book and read it quickly. It made me stop and think about what my actions will be toward others during high school."
5,Buddha Buddy,"When a new artistically talented boy shows up at Rucher high, calling himself Jinsen instead of his real name, and acting strange, sophomore classmate Justin doesn't understand why, but he also doesn't know why Jinsen tolerates the continual harassment by the other students without complaint. More of a portrayal of friendship than of Buddhism, Buddha Boy shows how the practice of religious tenets can turn a person's life around. Koja manages to do this in a non-preachy way, noting through Justin's observations that all religions are about the same thing but that religion doesn't seem to make any difference in making people better or changing the way they act. Several chapters begin with Justin's comments on karma or other issues and then flash back to the events that formed them. Justin's growing concern about the way his classmates treat his friend, and how the school officials ignore it to serve their own interests, trigger actions that result in karma for both of them."
3,Count of envelopes not exactly 100.,"The quality of envelopes was good but we got only 70 envelopes in an order for ""box of 100"". I had ordered from ""Columbian Envelopes"" because they had got good customer reviews, and I had not expected this from their delivery."
5,Greeting Card Envelopes,The envelopes I ordered arrived in perfect condition and performed exactly as described. I can now create personalized cards and envelopes that always impress the recipients. A great product combined with great service!
2,Seeing is believing...,"The photo that you see is not what you will be getting. It shows the ""pointed"" seal but in reality - it's a straight across seal. I even checked to make sure I didn't order the wrong envelopes. I ordered these for wedding invitations and was very disappointed that I didn't get what I ordered... :("
1,Item is not the one shown in the photo and arrives damaged!,"I assumed incorrectly that I wouldn't run into the same luck that other buyers did- they do indeed send envelopes with a flat seal, not the pointed one as the photo illustrates, and the box has a dented corner which ruins half the stack of envelopes."
3,Half satisfying.,"Although I envy these wonderful women and think it is great they were given an opportunity to tell there unique story, it was not balanced. Book dealing the over covered and their incredible friendship was just barely shared. The power of one ""true"" friend is something I would have enjoyed reading about."
4,I loved it but....,"It definitely has the humor you'd expect and I like that but it does lack in fights, action scenes, etc. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to have a good laugh instead of no holds barred action. The only thing that I had an issue with was the main characters' dense/cluelessness about certain things."
2,Do not pay even close to 40 for this. Wait for price drop.,"Would rate it 5, but the price killed it.Just wanted to write this real quick. Its one of my favs and Ive watched my bootleg version over and over again. However, this price is rediculous. Until the price goes down, plz, for ur own good, do not pay 50$ for this. However, when the price does lower, it is a very good series to have. Ending is horrible, however, because season 2 is comming out, it kinda makes sense.Im waiting for the price to lower before I buy my R1 release. Again, DO NOT BUY THIS AS LONG AS ITS AROUND 40-50$. ITS A RIPOFF RETARDED PRICE!!!!"
1,Where is the English dub?,"Make an English dub of this and I will buy it. I refuse to support any anime company that releases series that are Japanese with English subtitles only. This is stupid because this is the United States and we speak English here. The whole purpose of watching anime is the beautiful animation. Why would I wish to spend my time reading subtitles and missing out on the gorgeous artwork? Answer: I wouldn't.Anime companies should wise up and release English dubbed versions. You need to cater to your audience, not the other way around. Learn or never sell your products. What a disappointment to be interested in a series, only to find no dub and realize you will never purchase an incomplete product."
3,Far from the best,"This mug is nice becuase it's porcellen, and has a wide enough base that it won't spill when you're drinking coffee at your desk. I'm not crazy about the lid design. You have to be very carful not to over fill the mug, or coffee will splash up when you put the lid on. You also have to be careful taking the lid off, becuase coffee tends to splash up on your clothes even if the cup is empty."
3,Serves The Pupose But Doesn't Keep Liquids Warm,This mug is good if you want something that doesn't easily tip over but it doesn't keep hot coffee hot for long.
4,Best coffee mug you could ever buy!!,"I just recently purchased this item for my husband as a Father's Day present.He had a couple of them years ago and they eventually got broken and we were unable to find them anywhere to buy a replacement.He takes his coffee seriously...it goes where he goes even 8 hours away when he goes off to work every other 2 weeks so this cup is perfect for travel. He's a mechanic so the dark colors are ideal since it's always at his side no matter what he is doing.He says that it is the best style mug that he has ever had.My only problem with the mug that I purchased is the size. I purchased this particular mug because compared to the other listings exactly like it, it stated that it was a 16 oz. mug instead of the 14 oz. like the others. However when I received the mug, the tag on it showed it being a 14 oz. mug.The FedEx shipping was extremely fast too."
4,Cobolt Blue Wide Base Ceramic Coffe Mugs,I purchased two of these mugs. The quality is excellent and they were well packed. My only complaint is that the 'Cobolt Blue' is a whole lot closer to what I call 'Midnight Blue' and would very easily be mistaken for black.
5,A cup that makes your coffee taste better.,I write alot of high rated reveiws because I am a good shopper. I already knew that these cups were good ones. I am happy with purchase and really do believe that my coffee tastes better in my new cup.
1,Disappointed. It doesn't keep my coffee hot.,"I really wanted to like this mug, but it does a very poor job of keeping my coffee hot. I didn't send it back due to the return shipping costs. I went with an insulated mug that kinda looks like a starbucks cup. That works much better"
2,Ceramic travelmug,Looks neat but does'nt retain heat well at all. Maybe I'll stick some flowers in it and put it on my dashboard. ( Might make a good attractant for girls who knows)
3,Only 3 stars for slow delivery & high shipping cost,"I'm lovin' this mug - even though it took forever to arrive & with shipping, cost me $20! I had one back in the 80's that eventually broke & I'd been keeping an eye out for another for a very long time. I don't use this one as a travel mug, I like it for my A.M. coffee, at home because it holds 16 oz. and keeps my coffee hot. I do know it works well in the car, too as I used to take my other one on the road and it rides very nicely. I would have given this 5 stars, but deducted 2 for slow delivery (maybe because I ordered black - now I see black is not even offered on Amazon) and because of $8 for shipping (2/3 of the mug cost), but now that it's here I'm happy to have it"
4,Couldn't Put it Down! A Keeper!,"Predictable in many ways as Regency novels are, I still found the main characters compelling. Both try to fight their growing attraction for each other. Although not really spending much time together, the little things they find out make them fall in love. Throw in a little unrequited love, growing passion & some jealousy and I felt the tale was splendid! What is Eleanor going to request of Geoffrey? How can this work out? I had to finish it to find out the answers. I hope Shannon Donnelly will continue with novels about the remaining siblings!"
3,Great maps - Lousy software,"The maps are good. They even show foot trails and two tracks very accurately. At least those more than a few years old.The problem is that they start with great base map data and then do very little beyond that. The PC software is lame. The Topo Canada data is not compatible with the Topo USA data. You can only load one or the other onto your GPS at a time. And forget trying to combine the data from the two programs on your PC, that doesn't work either. I have had the Topo USA software for several years now and there have been ZERO updates.THe bottom line is that I love the Magellan units, I have had 3 over the years. The Thales maps are good detailed data. The Thales software for the PC is as lame as it gets.If somebody else comes out with maps compatible with the Magellan GPS unit I will definitely give it a try before buying a Thales product again."
2,User unfriendly product from customer unfriendly company,"Maps used in this software are very old and inacurate. Rivers, ponds, parks and other details are not where they are in reality. Locations of these (on the map) are sometimes off by as much as 600 feet (200 meters). How the heck can you ever find anything when it's off by that much?!?!User cannot edit maps to reflect actual locations.User cannot edit obsolete POIs such as doctors offices that are no longer where the map tells you, etc.If you're using Explorist GPS you should be prepared for a big headache: you need 2 software packages to transfer maps to your unit, the mapsend + another software that converts mapsend to explorist.Any questions you may have for thales or magellan customer service remain unanswered - no replies."
1,Software discontinued. Unable to upload to GPS.,This software was discontinued by the manufacturer and is unable to be uploaded into the GPS units advertised. The software required to upload this to the GPS is no longer produced because it crashes your GPS and makes it unusable. If you contact Magellan they will tell you you can upgrade your GPS through them at a reduced rate but this software is defunct.
1,Magellan Mapsend Canada - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Tried installing this software on three different laptops. No go! I can install and it looks like everything has properly installed but the software will NOT run. I uninstalled and tried again, still no luck just won't run.Don't waste your money buying this software."
4,Important if traveling to Canada.,"This is an important piece of software if you travel to Canada and use a GPS to navigate. It shows most roads and has a lot of information. The only drawback is that you need to insert the disk everytime you want to open the program. Which means you need to carry it with you. And you can't make a copy and leave the original at home because the copy will not open the program. But if you don't mind taking the disk with you, it is very complete and a big help when traveling to Canada. It is also good for trip planning."
1,Very disapointing purchase,This Cd does NOT cover PW's Greatest hits. Most of the tracks are completely unknown to me (probably B-sides). Moreover the few so called Hits are poor re-recordings by a performer who has largely past th age of retirement. This CD is worthless and deserves no star at all.
4,IT WAS GREAT WHEN IT ALL BEGAN,"It's sleazy, it's greasy, it's cheap and it's cheesy: it's the original ""Rocky Horror Show"" from 1973, starring Tim Curry. The energy and enthusiasm of the cast is infectious, and the primitive garage-band recording style only adds to the charm. Highlights include ""Science Fiction"" sung my Patricia Quinn, a very perky and funny ""Dammit Janet,"" a Beach-Boys style ""Sword of Damolces,"" a very horny version of ""Touch-a Touch Me"" and of course, Tim Curry's fabulous star turns: a blistering rendition of ""Sweet Transvestite,"" a hypnotic ""Don't Dream It"" and ""I'm Going Home,"" in which the diva breaks down, sobbing, ""I can't go on!"" Other cast members who appeared in the film are author / songwriter Richard O'Brien, Patrica Quinn, Little Nell and Jonathan Adams, doing the ""Time Warp"" again and again."
2,"If you're looking for specific information, look elsewhere.","For someone who want to simply learn how to get around Access, this book just MIGHT be appropriate. Complete it is not, certainly for a would-be developer who's trying to work out specific problems. Perhaps the book should have been named ""General Referend for Access 2000."" That would at least lead the would-be reader in the right direction."
4,The best value for the beginner,"Every book on programming has a few errors and this one is noexception to that rule. But few books at this price are as complete as this one. All the basics, and quite a few of the advanced concepts are here. Use this for your MOUS. Add to it for Exam 70-097 etc."
2,Encyclopedic but not very useful for beginners,"The book comes with a sample data base loaded on the CD but the author never took the time to illustrate the principles of data base construction with written out examples.A word to publishers of mammoth books like Anderson's; a neophyte software user is not going to be very adept at dreaming up examples of the principles, and therefor really learn from all of the massive amounts of information contained in the book. This book is very difficult to use and probably would not be used by a serious programmer since it is not aimed at that audience. In fact I'm not sure who the audience is supposed to be except for the group of unwary buyers."
3,"Good for users, Not for Developers",Too many advanced features are missing to be considered a developer reference.
4,Access 2000,"This book has clear and straight to the point objective. Computer novices should find this book as an excellant reference and be able to use it as a ""How to do it"" guide."
5,Historically factual,You may be offended or shocked at what this book contains but it's true. A must for all biblical prophecy scholars. Read it and use the information. Give it to a Catholic friend. A very important book for the very near future.
2,Very instrumental in my conversion,"I read this book and some of Jack Chick's comic books many years ago and avidly believed them. But then I found some historical errors, and that led me to dig more deeply and discover what the ""Romanists"" really did teach and really did do through history.The difference between what Chick says and what the ""romanists"" believenand have done is striking. It was chick's very errors that led me into the Catholic Church, the church founded by Christ and currently ably headed by Pope John Paul the 2nd."
4,A good book to expose the apostate Catholic cult.,"Chick does a good job exposing th agenda of the Catholic church. I rather enjoy his over the top style of expose. We as Bible believers need to stand up in this day of compromise and see the Catholic churches goals- to build the end time, apostate, ecumenical church. Stand fast, even though it is not popular. There is a remnant church standing for the truth and J.C. speaks for them onthis topic."
5,O'Reilly agrees great stuff,"I recently saw the author on O'Reilly Factor and was very impressed with what he had to say, so I bought the book. I too am a former dancer and was interested in the perspective of a man who worked ""inside"" (for more years than I could ever last.)Couldn't put it down, the book is great fun to read. The author doesn't make himself out to be a hero, or all knowing, or even all good. What he does do, is take you for a ride through the club with his stories of events and his keen perceptions. You end up wanting to know more.A must read for any man wanting to understand dancers and the strip club business."
1,"An OK Read, not what I was expecting.....","Typical mob stuff and it all plays out like a Las Vegas CSI show. I danced at this club years ago and the owner was a pretty raunchy man. No class and of course was one of those managers who wanted favors from his girls. If you have lived in Vegas for a few years it's actually getting pretty old to hear about this on the news and now it's in writing to go down in history forever.Typical man book,written from his point of view. More about the crime part of the business than the actual dancing side. There are better books out there that are more about the actual dancing side of the business and not the crime drama......."
5,An eye opener,"I found the author of this book to be very passionate about his experiences and feelings even showing a sensitive side towards the entertainers. He also was very curt, straight to the point and no sugar coating his words, participation and actions. Mr. Jordan just told his story even when it meant showing his role in the business, when at times it may not have been showing him in very good light. That added to my feelings that his story is real. This book took me thru a typical night, behind the scenes, in a strip club, via the eyes of someone who was there ""hands on"" minus the percieved glamour of it all. He even allowed an Entertainers point of view in one chapter which I thought was a nice extra to the book.I highly recommend the book for those that have an interest on this subject. This book was written in the midst of trials and investigations going on not only in his city but with individuals portrayed in the book. I wish him much success and even more peace."
1,Not too great for removing old caulking,"The edges weren't sharp enough to even scratch at the old caulking. It just wore down the points of the tool to make it useless. I guess my old caulk wasn't cracked, mildewed or crumbling enough for it to make any difference. I suggest using a flathead screwdriver instead to carefully remove it. Just don't scratch your surface."
2,Sustained Competitive Advantage?,"Peter Senge wrote ""the only sustainable competitive advantage is to learn faster than your competition."" Hmmm, makes sense.Unfortunately in this book, the author is into buzzwords. The author does not explain how to build a sustained competitive advantage. But then again you already know that is not possible. Yes, you can have a competitive advantage in your supply chain - the problem is there is no reason that your competitors can't do the same thing ... so what is sustained? Just some more jive to take advantage of logistics concepts that are as old as Napoleon's army."
1,Buzzwords,"As Theodore Levitt observed ""man lives not by bread alone but mostly by buzzwords"". Little substance here. Like many books of its type would have been much better if it was 1000% shorter."
2,"Tons of Theory & Buzzwords, Zero practical application","Lots of talk about ""mushroom-shaped business models"" and ""value constellations"", and maybe 1 good framework that is useful (the phases of supply chain efforts).Everything worthwhile is in the first couple of chapters - after that it devolves into hypothetical mumbo-jumbo without a supporting case study in sight.Great if you want to examine the possibilities, but it smacked of the late-90's ""any business model is possible"" thinking.Lots of stuff like ""in the future, businesses will have to choose who in their supply chain will do all the purchasing for every company, and share costs and revenues"". It sounded a lot like Marx's ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.""I was looking for practical advice on how to move my company forward. I wasted 2 five-hour flights reading this."
4,Do you Have a Supply Network?,"A useful and thought provoking text for supply / purchasing professionals looking for inspiration on how to improve their organisation, no matter how basic their organisation is - everybody has to start somewhere. Although mainly focussed on consumer / FMCG corporations Poirier writes in an entertaining and logical way, with plenty of case references to exemplify what he is explaining. Very relevant in these times of technicological change, poirier also explains how the web can enable supply networks to create a virtual ""glass pipeline"" of information.A ""must read"" if you are serious about transforming your organisation."
4,Different tone for Meyer,"If you're a Deon Meyer fan, this book will be a little different than those of us that like Lemmer. I've not read about this character before and the start is a little slow, but ramps up to plenty of suspense. For anyone that's never read Meyer I recommend him, though I live in South Africa and find that I relate to culture and places more than most American's would."
4,Dead before Daybreak,"Once again and excellent book by Deon Meyer, I have unfortunately read his books out of sequence I think this was his first and was a little disjointed in certain parts, otherwise an excellent read."
3,Damaged psyches and bitter histories uncovered in a fast paced thriller,"Dead at Daybreak showcases a cast of broken characters, all of whom have been affected by the social pressure cooker that is South Africa. More than in his other books, Deon Meyer covers life under apartheid and shows how racial oppression left its mark on everyone living in the country. Meyer has constructed powerful interwoven narratives dominated by issues of identity and guilt. He delves deeply into personal histories and damaged psyches to produce another gripping tale that keeps the reader hanging on to the very last page. The storyline is complex and might be confusing for readers not familiar with the demands South Africa's security machine made on young white men, conscripted for ever lengthening periods during the 1980s to sustain an increasingly desperate defense of the pariah state. Deon Meyer sets such high standards that although not his best, Dead at Daybreak is well worth the read."
3,Dead at Daybreak review,Great book but not as intence and constantly gripping as some of his other work. That said:I do still recommend this book. But if you are a first time Deon Meyer reader I suggest you start with 13-Hours or Tracker. I am a big fan of Deon Meyers books!
5,Brilliant,"This book suggests that psychiatry may not be the 'answer' to mental illness, and provides great insight into the lives of those living with mental illness. An enjoyable and interesting read for everyone."
2,before you buy,"okay...I have not read this one, (I'll admit) but I have watched his MANY videos on Y0utub3. Check this guy out before you buy. See your Doctor before you buy. Talk to friends before you buy into his ""theories"".please."
5,It Works!!!,"I love this book and it works. This book teaches you how to pray the word of God. God said in His word that His word will not return to Him void, it will accomplish what it's set out to do. When we pray the word of God that's how it is returned to Him and He has to perform it. I've seen the manifestation of it. Praying the word really works!"
2,dougv,"Prayer and the word of God are very important to me.This book was a disappointment. Except for the prayer on the word of God, the rest of the prayers werewere not helpful, in that they were lackluster. They didn't sound like they had God's annointing or heart.If I'd known the above, I wouldn't have bought the book.Recommend you not buy it."
2,Buy with caution.,These cards seem to work okay but with one major drawback. The newer slim PS2s cannot see these cards at all. My older fat PS2 can see and use them fine. Every slim model I've tried them on won't even see them in the browser. I've see this issues with these cards and Mad Catz so far.
4,Very open comments with regard to their experiences.,"I enjoyed the book, having gone through many of the anxieties and disappointments the players went through. However, I noticed a couple of errors that I would like to mention. On Page 110 of the Bert Shepard segment, you describe the P-38 as the Thunderbolt. I believe the P-38 was known as Lightening. The P-47 was known as the Thunderbolt.On page 174 of the Guy Morton segment, you say that Chattanooga was a member of the Sally League. I remember this team, Managed by Cal Ermer as being in the Class AA Southern Association in 1956.Finally, I would like to contact Maurice Fisher. We were teammates in 1955 with the San Francisco Seals. He lives some forty five miles north of Columbus, Ohio. Can you give me his exact address?I have been trying to get the Box scores for August and September 1954. Can you help me?"
3,Disappointing,"This purchase was a great disappointment to me. Not because of the quality of the music, which is quite good, but because everything in the presentation of the product, including the very detailed reviews, led me to believe that this was the famous ""Gene Norman Presents"" 1947 version, an absolute high point in jazz history. Sadly, this version is altogether different and nowhere near. As both items are labeled ""Stardust"", there is an obvious explanation for a misunderstanding, which will hand the company the benefit of the doubt, but to other jazz lovers searching for that precious 1947 jewel: Beware! Things might not be what they seem!"
4,On an Edge of Steel,"Like other Burke novels the character is given a crystal clear goal and he pursues the monster with every step he takes. An extremely quick read but enjoyable as always.Unlike other thriller writers, Vachss implants/transfers his disgust and rage against criminals who prey on the weak or unfortunate. Having been exposed to this brand of evil makes the eventual conclusion feel righteous and the reader is left not feeling a shred of sympathy for the villain, who is by his crime a despicable coward."
4,"Peopled by Freaks, Both Good and Bad","This is a great read. The novel is peopled with freaks, both good and bad. Vachss' descriptions are like a ground fog rising on a steamy New England day. They're dense, opaque and filled with mystery.His characters are 'noir'. They're over the top and outside of society in a sub-culture that has real values and true connections that don't exist in the realm of language but belong to a deeper place inside ourselves where words cease to exist. Their connections are through the fog, obscured by the limits of every day existence.This is the best book Vachss has ever written. I hope it will be followed by more books of this caliber by him."
3,It was OK...,"In this book, Burke tries to help the nephew of a man he knew in prison. This man's nephew is accused of a sex killing. The plot takes some unlikely turns. The characters and dialogue are often stilted."
1,"Does not fit properly, Does not retain charge :(","I was attracted by the price like yourself. Bought it.The casing is poorly made. It has a bow to it and cannot latch.The cells do not keep charge.I normally do believe that the after market products do work, but this one just didn't."
5,"Storr, Freud, and Jung","Storr not only clears up much of the misinformation surrounding creativity and madness, but once again proves himself to be a remarkably clear interpreter of both Freud and Jung."
5,Violeta Parra folk songs from her travels,Cantos Campesinos includes rare songs from the early part of Violeta Parra's career. Violeta traveled throughout the Chilean country side and collected songs composed and sung by campesinos in remote areas of Chile. This is a treasure trove of the Chilean campesino culture as it existed pre-cell phone and pre-television.
5,It's the women's ultimate truth,"If you read this book over and over again you will always find a new aspect to contemplate every time you read a new page . However, this depends on the cycle of your life and your perception. Osho was a gift sent to the women on earth to start a war against sleep ......!"
3,a mixed review,"Always love the color and texture of Under the Nile babybody onesie (and all Under the Nile products), but there is some inconsistency in the fabrication from one batch to the next. I probably ordered 10 onesies over the last 5 months and a couple were so ill fitting that my daughter really couldn't wear them. I would say that there were slight differences in fit with several of them, but for the most part, they were wearable. Generally, they seem to be less suitable for a long torso'd baby. My 5 month old girl is wearing the 12 month size to get enough length in the body, but the leg holes now seem somewhat too small and too straight (not quite enough rise on the sides to make them comfortable when she's active). Bottom line, they were terrific when my daughter was smaller but they don't seem to be as suitable as she is getting bigger and more active. I really wish they fit better because you can't beat the softness and the lovely muted colors."
4,runs big,"These body suits are very nice and high quality, but run large. Our baby is 11 pounds, 22"" and the 0-3 size still seems big."
3,Just ok,"These were not as great as I had hoped. I wanted as much organic clothing as possible for my baby and was excited to try this, but the fit was strange- a bit tight at the top/neck area- and the color (yellow) was unattractive in person. This lived at the bottom of the dresser drawer and only came out when laundry was running low."
2,granny style / leg holes too tight!,"In general I love Under the Nile baby clothes: they are wonderfully soft, often thick cotton, lasting and size just right for my baby who is in 99th height percentile, when all the other brands are always too small for her age group. HOWEVER, this top is strangely cut. It is ""granny style"" at the bottom, and the holes for the legs are to tight for my baby's thighs (and she's not that fat - just really long). I got three tops and opened one, so I will return the other two and try to move the snaps on the one I have to allow for more room. Very disappointed as I have all the matching footed pants and love love love them!"
3,Great quality but not true to size,"3-6 months? Maybe not for a 3 month old unless your kid has monkey arms. I stowed it away for when my baby is bigger, probably when she hits 14 pounds.That said, the cotton is super soft and it is well made."
3,Misleading Title Description,"I ordered two of these bodysuits in Natural, and while the quality of the cotton was amazing, they weren't ""side snaps"". However, if you click on the picture of the Natural colored one, it *doesn't* appear to be a side snap bodysuit. It should be in a different listing. It's a really thick, beautiful cotton though."
1,Unsafe at Any Speed,"The shiny chrome handle bars cannot be tightened properly. The result is a constant misalignment, and a consistent loosening of the front wheel assembly. ""Why did my bike break into two pieces, daddy?"" wondered my three year old as I tried picking-up the bike by the handle bar."
1,Do not buy,We have received it as a present and my daughter (2.5 years old) was never able to ride it because the front wheel does not stay alligned and one of the back ones keeps coming off.
2,Wouldn't buy again,"Looks nice, but remember this is an inexpensive toy. So the stamped steel pieces and hardware show their ""Made in China"" origins. Front wheel is not true (straight), thereby making aligning the handlebars with the front fender and wheel impossible. Very aggravating. So handlebars are now straight in reference to the frame, but the front wheel tilts over a tiny bit, and the front fender sits crooked. And that's the best compromise. Paint seems nice, though."
2,Not the right Trike..,CONS: Very poorly made. Front wheel leans left. Tips easy. No rear handle.PROS: Retro look is pretty cool. And my 2 year old son loves it but then again he loves our neighbors pink one too.I would not recommend this Trike.Buy a newer style one with a rear handle.
4,A fun little tricycle for a toddler.,"I got this tricycle for my nephew for his second birthday. Although it may be a little beyond him, he was still dazzled by it. The seat is comfortable enough for them to stay on it and is adjustable. Assembly is pretty straight forward and simple.I gave it 4 stars because there were a couple parts that seemed a little flimsy. The rear step is press formed and a little thin. The same process was used for the seat. Another minor defect was that the seat wasn't perfectly square to the body. Since the adjustable rod for the seat is squared, when you tighten the set screw, it forces it to that offcenter point. Something I noticed, but it's not dramatic and certainly wouldn't affect the ridability.A fun toy for a toddler in your life!"
1,Poorly Made,"We purchased this tricycle for our 3yr son. The aesthetic appeal of this tricycle is undeniable. The assembly was very straight forward and well thought out. Unfortunately, they machining process of the manufacturer is very poor. The Handlebars slip so easily it discouraged our son from learning to ride. We tried tightening the screws and bolts to the point of stripping the bolts but there is nothing to prevent the slippage. I cannot recommend this to others considering our experience. Very disappointing because we expected so much from this particular brand."
3,Disturbing but a good read,"After seeing the movie, Mrs. Winterbourne, and realizing it had first been a book I was curious to read the book. I prefer the lightness of the movie since life itself is at times dark and difficult. However, the book has held my iterest and you can't help but hope for a happy ending. But isn't that how we live our lives through the darkest times - hoping for a better ending?"
4,one of Woolrich's better efforts...,"'I Married a Dead Man' is classic American noir fiction. Deceit, death and mystery are all packaged in a tight novel. Cornell Woolrich's expert use of descriptive language transports the reader back to the 1940s, in a setting where the unwashed mingle with the genteel rich. We have our heroine, a forelorn young mother, living a double life with a kind, wealthy couple who believe she is the wife of their deceased son (...yes, a fantastic set of circumstances justify this case of mistaken identity). As this false relationship turns more real (ie, a real bonding forms) our heroine becomes a victim of blackmail. The ending? Not what you will expect.Bottom line: yes, the story is contrived but delicious reading nonetheless. Recommended."
3,More suspense than mystery,"This reminds me of one of those postwar French novels where everything slowly screws itself into a tight ball of failure, and finally we the reader, feeling as if we've got an anvil on our chests, cannot wait for the final explosion of failure and inevitable burial of the cast. This is not a ""mystery"" novel in that there's little mystery, but a suspense novel of the dark and cynical kind, and while I generally like those, I did not find much to enjoy in this book and it fell short of literature in ""educating"" me about humanity. It is well written; no doubt there, as Woolrich is far more literate than all but a few contemporary authors. However, I did not attach to anything except a mounting sense of horror, and if I need that, I can always turn on the news. I would recommend this to students of the history of mystery and noire writing."
3,"THE BOOK IS GOOD, BUT, SO IS THE MOVIE MRS. WINTERBORNE","SOMETIMES, YOU JUST HAVE TO USE YOUR IMAGINATION.THEN AGAIN SOME PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE AN IMAGINATIONOR CARE TOO! LIFE IS SHORT!!!ENJOY IT!!! OR, ATLEAST LIGHTEN UP, DEAR HAMILTON AND EVERYONE. ITIS JUST A BOOK AND A MOVIE. WHAT DID THEY PAY FOR SUCHGRIM THOUGHTS??????"
2,Figure not painted in official Mighty Ducks uniform!,"Extremely disappointed that the figure is NOT even in the original Mighty Ducks uniform. The seller had promised that, at least, but it's completely off."
5,Good quality at a good price.,These envelopes are just the right size for using with the small invitation greeting card that I make. Good quality at a good price.
3,shipping caution,"The envelopes themselves are fine but beware of the company. they did not package the envelopes securely in the shipping box. When they arrived, the box was dented as well as the boxes the envelopes were in. You'd want to make sure that you double check your order when you receive it. Luckily my envelopes were fine despite the fact that the boxes were damaged. I was dissapointed with their packaging."
3,A little flimsy,They're OK but next time I will get the same ones in white that I did in cream if they have them.
3,Singing too rushed; listen to 1983 Reunion Concert instead,"I've always been on the lookout for ""Bowling Green,"" and picked up this CD because I thought it was the same version as performed on the Everlys' summer TV series, but not so. According to the liner notes, this was taken from a 1970 live concert in Anaheim, CA, and the arrangements were such that the songs were sung in a very fast tempo. The brothers broke up their team in 1973, so perhaps this CD reflected the weariness they were experiencing at the time. I recommend buying the 1983 Albert Hall reunion concert if you're interested in hearing the brothers live and at their (mature) best. Don's voice is so much richer and Phil's high harmonies are gorgeous. Check out their VHS biography Rock and Roll Odyssey. There's a clip from their variety show and ""Bowling Green"" is just wonderful! Also recommend EB 84 (On the Wings of a Nightingale)."
3,TheLiving Trust,"What I need is help using the disk that was sent when I purchased ""the living trust"". Do you know how I can get in contact with someone?"
1,Pure Disappointment,"As a regular Pure Barre client, I have come to love the Pure Barre workout in the studio. I bought the Flatirons: 2 DVD with the weighted ball, so I could still lift, tuck, and burn while away from the studio classes. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. The workout is only 32 mins long, not a ""45-minute full body workout"" like it claims to be. All of the sections are much shorter, and Carrie rushes through the sections. She didn't even include the last section (lying on your back and lifting your seat) as they do in the classes. I expected much, much more from Carrie and Pure Barre. If you are going to sell your products and brand at such a high-dollar, then you need to deliver what you say and what you teach in the classes. I will not buy anymore DVD's and I will think twice about renewing my yearly class pack."
3,NOT QuickBooks-compatible for checks,"I should have done more research and noticed that the other reviews here mention statements and invoices, not checks. For checks, both windows are a bit too low, exposing the ""pay to the order"" line and the memo under the address. The good news is that the addresses aren't cut off, but they don't look good.Also, to be really picky, the windows aren't parallel to each other. The bottom window seems to be cut slightly ""up hill"" in relationship to the top."
1,Envelopes Don't Seal,"These envelopes would be just fine except for one enormous problem. They don't seal properly. The first time I used these envelopes I spent more time making sure they sealed (and had to use tape on most of them!)than I have ever had to in stuffing an envelope!!! I had only one piece of paper in each envelope and apparently there isn't enough ""gum"" on it and/or they are old and dried out. At any rate I am extremely unhappy about this purchase and would like to warn others not to buy these."
3,alternator,This item came broken where the connector goes... very upset but since i got to keep my other one and didn't need to give it back as core I will be fine... It is priced at a very good price for it to have only that problem.
4,beautiful but small,I was looking for a peridot ring pendant to add to my moms neclace. She has a birthstone ring for her first grandchild so I was trying to get another for her 2nd grandchild. I could not find this ring at any local jeweler. I thought I found the same ring online. It looked identical to the one she already has except for a different stone. But it was almost half the size. My fault for not comparing their sizes. I needed one about a half inch diameter. This one is about 1/4 inch diameter. It is beutiful but small.
4,One Of The Best,"If you like the Rippingtons you will love this CD. If not give it a try you may come to love the Rippingtons like I do. Highlights of the album are a wonderful version of ""I'll Be Around"" sung by Jeffrey Osborne and the title track ""Sahara""."
2,Their First Flop!,"By the time this CD came out I had already been a fan of the Rippingtons for eight years. Obviously, those who reviewed this before me weren't very familiar with their earlier works. I was terribly disappointed with most of this!!! This CD does have it's moments....Girl With The Indigo Eyes, Native Sons Of A Distant Land, and True Companion. Overall, I felt that it was their first flop!!! I just know that they can do better than this because all of their previous disks were better."
1,"Unlistenable Fuzak, or, Aural Wallpaper",Listening to this disc is like eating a whole can of cake frosting. Russ Freeman makes George Benson sound like Jimmy Page. Don't you have better things to do with your money?
1,NOT AS PICTURED,"The one sent had a start capacitor sitting on top of the housing, so i had to move it to fit under the hot tub."
5,neat photo essay on guide dogs,This is a photo essay of a puppy who born into a family of service dogs. He is raised and trained well but the story has a twist. As the time nears for Ira to go into more detailed service dog training the facility isn't ready to take him. Instead he goes to work for Guide Dogs for the Blind. All ends well for the dog and the new owner. A list is featured in the back of the book of many organizations that provide service and guide dogs for people. Also listed are selection for further reading.The story created good dialog and helps children learn about how dogs can help those with disabilities.I would recommend this book to all kids who want to learn more about guide dogs and how they are trained. This would make a great addition to the library as there are only 3 other books in the collection on guide dogs.
4,Learning Tool and Entertaining,This is a great book to share with my 5-year-old granddaughter. It is educational (at her level) but yet entertaining!
5,"An awesome blockbuster, will amaze you","When I bought this book, I was worried about whether I would be getting my money's worth, considering the high price, but as a herp enthusiast who likes to collect books about various regions that are rich in unusual herpetofauna, I decided, with some trepidation, to go for it. I must say that I was totally awestruck by the sheer size of the book, the thoroughness of the accounts, covering every known species, spectacular color photos, beautiful maps, and easy readability. All sorts of interesting tidbits are thrown in from local folklore. This book is a masterpiece in terms of its content, as well as being an absolutely beautiful coffee table book. A must-have for all herp enthusiasts!"
2,issues with the packing/dealer,I first received this item with a broken frame. I contacted the dealer and they immediately resent the item. The second item had broken shelves. I again contacted the dealer and was trying to work with them to only replace the shelves as the mirror was in good shape. I contacted them both through e-mail and on the phone. I was told they would be contacting me but I have never received another call. Both packages were very poorly packed for shipping. I believe if proper packing of the fragile pieces would have occurred there would not have been a problem as the item itself is exactly what I was looking for.
2,poor quality,"Received this item and immediately heard broken glass inside the box. Upon opening, I found that the glass shelves had broken. The item was poorly packaged and the fragile glass was never properly secured inside. While the mirror and frame are attractive, the metal cabinet is very flimsy. Other than the mirror, the rest of the item is poorly constructed. But considering the price, I should have expected what I got. I always thought that Broan-Nutone was a reputable brand, selling quality products. I'm now suspecting otherwise. Spend a few dollars more and buy something of better quality.Amazon sent me another unit to replace the broken shelves. That replacement also was poorly packaged, but I was able to salvage one glass shelf to replace my broken one. That shelf also was chipped on the corner, but I decided to keep it and return the remaining unit to Amazon with their prepaid return label. No problems with Amazon."
3,All Most Perfect,I play golf all winter long and this heater is very helpful in keeping my hands warm. California winters are not that bad so it works here. I wish it had a low speed fan attachment or a shroud that would keep the heat more directly in front of you. Other than that it works well.
3,"Sweet book, in no way a classic","Bought this book to share with our one year old nephew to acquaint him with Canada over the next couple of years. It will do nicely - sweet pictures, light, lilting text, and this certainly isn't an award winning book."
5,Item is as pretty as it picture shown it to be.,Item is as pretty as it picture shown it to be. (Corelle Coordinates Chutney Melamine Tidbit Tray )
4,Arctic Dragon Premiere Mask,The dragon looks great for the price that I paid. It worked perfectly for my Asian murder mystery dinner party called Year of the Dragon. The shipping was fast and I received it ahead of schedule.
1,wrong part,The cardone 532734 power booster was not for a 1991 acura legend and when I order it the online sight would not let me select the year of the car.So how would they know the if it would fit or not.my number is 407-345-1143 name is Milton Anderson give me a call and let me now what I con do with this brake booster.Thank you.
4,great wipe but unpleasant scent,"These wipes are perfect for my kids who are long toilet-trained but haven't mastered the art of using toilet paper effectively. These wipes do the job nicely and then can conveniently be flushed away. The tub is good quality too. My only complaint is the scent. ""Magic melon"" smells, to me, like rotting watermelon. Luckily, the smell is not very strong and does not linger."
4,web development guidence,This book has a live example and steps to develop software in internet environment.It is simple and has a advanced concepts.every web devloper should have one of this kind.It is a good one to buy.
2,Extremely disappointing,"Despite my admiration for Zwicky, I must say I felt this book totally uninteresting; there is hardly anything on his methodology and many silly remarks, such as ""you can tell there are doing great work here, their restrooms are clean!"". Sadly, this was not a joke!"
5,Super informative book,I love all of the doll books written by Mildred Seeley but this one is one of her best. It is really a good book to have because it tells not only how to judge a doll but what to look for in dolls that you are thinking about purchasing. It is very informative for both the new collector as well as for someone who has been collecting for awhile. A great book that I would highly recommend.
5,GRP CHRISTMAS VOL3,I highly recommend this to anyone that likes smooth jazz and wants mood music for Christmas gatherings. Would also make a great stocking stuffer...
4,Good Music for Christmas Party,"This christmas collection was recommended by a friend and colleague who is a jazz lover. On his recommendation, I ordered it and have been pleased. It will be played at our Christmas parties this year to add festivities. Highly recommend."
5,"If you are reading this review, buy this book now.","If you are interested enough to read this review, then buy this book. Now. I have done quite a bit of programming ... The only problem was, I had never programmed VBA/Excel and was having a very rough time getting started.I bought ""Excel 2002 VBA Programmer's Reference"". I sat down and started reading Chapter 2. Before long, I was so excited that I was firing up my laptop. Four hours after I started reading the book, I had a prototype up and running. This book is amazing. Chapter 2 gave me more useful information than I sometimes get from an entire book. ...The authors are simply bursting with knowledge and give it freely. Ideas are expressed clearly and succinctly. Knowledge is well-organized and easy to find. Whether you want to approach the topic methodically or flip through looking for gems, you will find what you want here.Getting the object model is a great bonus. I'm going to enjoy spending a few days going through this one."
3,"Wrox, please hire an indexing expert!!!",The book would get 5 stars from me if only Wrox would spend the money on hiring an indexer for this book. It's very difficult to quickly find which pages have the information you need on most subjects and keywords.
3,"Great Book, But Fix The Index","I bought the previous edition (Excel 2000) of this book and was not satisified at all by the way it was put together. The second edition is a great improvement. The other reviewers have said nice things about this edition and I agree, but feel it can still be improved. This is a reference book but it has a terrible index. I can't find anything without reading through the chapters page by page. Please! Try again and it would be a great book to have."
5,Advanced,"The reader of this book must have programming knowledge and be a proficient Excel user. This was not written for absolute beginners. The book is best where it covers advanced feature's such as Add ins, programming the VBE, Windows API,Class Modules and writing international applications. However If you buy this book I would recommend WalkenBach's ""Excel Power Programming..."" which offers a better coverage of Userforms, Charts, Toolbars and Menu's.The book is very lean althogh it is about 1000 pages, it does not offer plenty of examples but the code that is given is very useful. Although could not grasp the chapter's about com add ins and programming the Smarttags I would classify this book as one written in a very clear and approachable way."
4,Works but does not quite fit,"I have a DeLonghi AR690 and it works but the dial doesn't fit so the ""ON"" is now about half an inch from it's original point. We had to remark the dials."
2,Would Not Buy Again!,"Tastes like cheap coffee with very little flavor. The packets don't have enough in them to make a strong coffee with 6 cups of water, like listed on the package. I would not buy again. The Melitta European is much better!"
4,Treasue of the Mayans,"This book was a good source of information about the Mayans, and I suggest it to anyone who wants to learn about the mayans."
1,Important Question,I am interested in this album and would like to know what songs are on this. So if someone could please post the track listings that would be great. Thanks
1,Awful.,"This book is terrible. It shows bad jumping, heels falling back over the jumps, elbows out to the side like a cowboy, and very unclear directions about setting up gymnastic lines. I am planning on returning it ASAP. In addition to bad content, it is full of typos- major typos. Again- AWFUL. How did this thing get published???"
5,Jumping Problems Solved,"This book is excellent for anyone that has a problem with their horse jumping, whether in competition or at home or pony club. It gives detailed information, photos and also grid layout for almost every issue you may ever have with your horse.Plus there are excellent tips on how to make your jump off fast and accurate - who would not want that in a competition! Winners are grinners.This book is also a must for any SJ/XC instructor - Highly recommended!Jenna"
2,Knowledgable but unimaginative,"Booker states that apart from his PhD in English Lit he has also written over a hundered articles on nuclear physics and electronics, which is enough to make you spew.Given that I have been theorising on the Menippea for the last four years, I find Booker's approach a little facile... his approach to ""defining"" Flann O""Brien as a menippean satirist amounts to ticking off the elements that correspond to Bakhtin's hit-list.He also makes no mention of Kirk's Bibliography, which is a glaring omission. Overall, a poor effort, from someone who obviously regards themselves as an egghead intellect.(Why do Americans continually abbreviate their first names to initials?from D. Bruce Musgrave"
4,!,simply amazing - listen as you commute and you will be ready for most anything- I especially enjoy track 6- heard it on Pandora at first and ordered the cd- and was just totally blown away-
5,I Think Of This As Two Dildos,"Here are the dimensions:Total length: 28""Heads: 2-3/4"" wide x 3-1/2"" longShaft: 2-1/2"" wideI think of of this a two medium-thick dildos for the price of one. When it arrives, it will be bent back on itself and wrapped in plastic, leaving a permanent bend in the middle. For me, that's not a problem because trying to use this thing full length for anal play is just an exercise in frustration. It's just too long and floppy to get any leverage. So I cut this into two dildos. I chose to make one about 13"" long and the other about 10"" long. This material is flexible but strong and very durable, and has a pleasant smell. This can be used at room temperature without any problem but warming in hot water for 10-15 minutes makes it a little more flexible and comfortable."
3,The claims are true,"I am one of the freelance writers hired to write stories for this book. The claims below are true. The 'author' of this book did hire freelance writers to contribute and then skipped out without paying many of them. She did pay me for one story, but the other story was never paid for."
5,My kids loved this book!,My kids really enjoyed listening to this book on one of our many road trips. They now have many parts memorized and repeat them often. They didn't tire of it as I thought they would. They continued to ask to hear it again and again.
1,Good example for would-be children's book authors,"If Romano weren't famous,this book would have never made it to print. Lacking in almost every element of a good story, it is a great example to use if you are teaching people how to write children's books--how NOT to do it, that is. I imagine it sold a bazillion copies. Oh well."
1,Fake!,"I was hesitant to purchase on-line, however, my husband really likes this cologne and it's getting harder and harder to find in the stores. Also, it is one of a few that does not give me a headache. When it arrived we immediately knew it was not the actual Pierre Cardin, but a copy - should have known by the reasonable price. The scent is completely different and the bottle is missing the Pierre Cardin markings. Shame on me that I did not notice it could not be returned, but I would suggest that information that important be typed in a larger font, not just bold since there are lots of highlighed/bold comments on these item pages."
1,Not the original,This is not the original cologne formula from the early 1980's. Not sure what the problem is but it is not the same. My wife has a good nose ;-)
1,This is NOT the same cologne I've purchased before!,"I love the aroma of Pierre Cardin, and have bought it several times over the years since I first discovered it. But, like several of the other people who commented here, I too think my latest purchase is NOT the real thing. They have either changed the formula of the cologne, or it is a counterfeit ... probably the latter. The bottle I received did NOT have the traditional Pierre Cardin marking on the bottle cap, and it does not smell nearly as nice as what I have always purchased before. Plus, the scent doesn't last very long, like the original did. I too have had a difficult time finding it in stores locally, but after this experience, I'm not so sure I'll want to buy it online again. Of course, if I do decide to try to buy it online again, I'll definitely buy it from Amazon, since they are very good about returns. I made the mistake of buying it elsewhere where the price was a little less."
2,"apparently, it's all because of the drugs (man)!","While the book is informative (although it told me little that i didn't already know, just from listening to the music and hanging around in record stores for the last 30 years), i found three points very irksome...1. the wholesale dismissal of prog-rock from countries other than England. Macan's focus is (self-admittedly) England, but that's not the problem...the problem is his contention that other countries made no significant contributions to the genre, which is patently _false_.2. the importance he places on hallucinogens and other drugs...there are more references to drugs than to all but the most significant bands/ musicians.3. his attribution of some sort of organized ""agenda"" or even conspiracy among rock critics against Prog-Rock....while it is undeniable that certain critics (and some quite prominant ones) _did_ hate the genre, the theory of a ""party-line"" in opposition to the genre seems outright silly."
2,Just where is the passion?,"This book is like an academic thesis. Written in the way someone would write up notes of a physics experiment.Just where is the passion for this wonderful music??My main BIG criticism of American Edward Macan's book, other than how dry it is, that although it purports to be "" English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture"", it is obviously written 'second hand' from the other side of the Atlantic. For example a book called ""Rocking The Classics"" about the English 'Progressive' scene that totally fails to mention The Enid once is almost [...]Englishman Paul Stump's 'The Music's All That Matters: A History of Progressive Rock', on the other hand was , like myself, definately 'there'. It is far more of an interesting read and has a lot of well though and valid, or at least challenging, criticism."
4,3rd Edition of A Classic Pottery & Porcelain Ceramics Guide,"Updated version of the useful guidebook, containing 390 pages, with more than 1,200 black and white photos and a 16 page full color section. There are 125 sketches of markings, for reference. Year 2000 pricing is provided, along with collecting guidelines, and a glossary of terms. The book is completely indexed for easy reference. Topics range from Austrian, Doulton, Harker, to UHL, Warwick and Zsolnay. Each topic is described. The volume is an easy to use reference work. With its handy size, you'll want to keep it with you when you antique. Add it to your library."
5,more than just a kidnapping story,"The Solid Gold Kid was a little slow and contained some unnecessary details in the first chapter, but after that, I couldn't put the book down. In the last 25% of the book, Mazer and Mazer gave a powerful and realistic account of the psychological effects of having been kidnapped. This gave the book more meaning and separates it from other ""typical"" kidnapping stories."
5,I've read it at least four times!!!,"I love stories and movies like this! The authors have a way of putting you right in those chairs, that attic, the van, right along with Derek and his friends. If you're looking for a book that you can really put yourself into, this is the one!"
5,So cute!,"These perfectly match my other utensils, they're perfect for little jobs like condiments. I love the design too! It's called Trebel Clef which appeals to the musician in me, but the curl at the end of the handle reminds my husband of our favorite movie. These are very sturdy too! Love them! I hope this company comes out with even more products in this pattern."
2,Eve's Addiction Jewelry,I am very disappointed with this necklace. I bought the zodiac necklace for my niece and I received the necklace with a stone missing. I also had purchased a Lucky Horse Shoe Charm and the stone fell out of it as well. I am very reluctant to purchase anything else from this company.
1,What Could Have Been,When I read the synopsis for this story I thought finally a book about someone that's not a size 6 with long legs blah blah blah. You know the kind of story. What a major major disappointment. I only read maybe a good five chapters from this book and I made myself read those few and still did not miss a beat. There was so much that could have been done with this story.
2,Hmm Not so much,"The story called to me. Thinking it would be awesome from some the reviews I was a bit disappointed. It wasn't so much the story that was bad but the characters. That said, even the character development and the plot and some of the obstacles that were thrust into the story worked very well. Both frustrating and rewarding the idea behind the story and the overall finished product were a good deal. My main problem was with the leads, hero and heroine. Both seemed a bit forced and the hero, in my opinion, wasn't very likable most of the time. I think the author was going for dominant and self-assured but ended up with a bit bullheaded and sometimes contradictory. It was also missing a certain natural flow that often embodies the really awesome romances out there. All in all I would not recommend this book."
2,UGH!!!!!,"I really do not know why I keep buying this author's books. I really was hoping that this story was better than the last, but I still feel like it was a ruined storyline. What is the deal with the language that is used by her? I have finally learned my lesson and I will not be purchasing anymore of her books. She really just ruined a great family story that had so much potential. The book was all over the place. You have one person's thoughts two days ahead and then jump back to the other's person's thoughts for today. JUST UGH!!!!! I don't know what type of reading all these other reviewers are used too, but this is not a good style of writing. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I will stick with my other romance authors from now on."
3,A true account of the misery these illnesses bring us.,"I read this book in 88 after my son was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and so much is similar to what I have lived. My husband and my other son did not understand why I was protecting him, they were reacting like the doctors the Hinkleys have seen before everything broke loose. I knew he was sick, and I did what Mrs Hinkley did. We have progressed in the field of mental illness, but there is still so much to be done. I wish all parents of mentally disabled people could share their pain. Go to A.M.I.' I know this not a true review of the book, but the book is a true review of the pain we suffer. Thank you for allowing me to share my thoughts with others."
5,Get a pack!,"If you break E strings constantly like me, just get a pack of these and you dont have to buy a whole new pack jsut for one string. they are cheaply packaged, and personally i cant tell the quality of a wire from another wire. it plays an E."
4,"Not the quality of name brands, but good for spares","Well, the title pretty much says it all. I don't break strings that often, but when I do, it's usually the high E. These are handy to keep you from opening an entire set of 6 when you do break an E string, especially while gigging."
3,Requires drilling,I'm using the guides to replace factory guides on my Strat and Tele. They will require that I drill a shallow hole to seat the guide properly. I hate drilling holes in guitars but it has to be done. The quality of these guides is not what I expected. They are cast and plated and have some rough edges to them. If you want a very clean looking finish I would look for a higher quality guide. At this point I'm not even sure that I will use them.
2,Uneven post,"Love the appearance of these spring trees. I first started using them when i bought an american std tremolo (came with them). And now I bought a new pair for a new Strat build recently... But the post that goes through one of the trees was uneven. When it comes to these small parts, ironically, I'm having better luck with the QC of made in asian knock offs."
2,Fender String Trees,"I installed staggered locking tuners, which actually made these a moot point. But instead of having two screw holes in the headstock, I got these just for looks. They look alright, but I'm not inordinately impressed. They certainly look nicer than the stamped stock ones, they look like they produce less friction, but I don't believe they have rollers, they merely have a knob on each side the string runs under. If you're really going to use them, you might want to keep looking until you run across some with real rollers. I thought these had rollers. They appear to and I've read in blogs they do. Otherwise for looks and bragging rights, these say ""FENDER"" (add$$)."
4,A nice addition to my strat?,"I must admit I purchased these because of the low price and was not sure exactly what it was these were supposed to do. I am a beginner guitar player and purchased these only because I noticed some pro musician's had them on their guitars. They do seem to be obviously better than the part they are intended to replace. As far as tuning, I can't say that the difference is really noticeable."
4,Nice looking string trees,"These are nice replacement string trees over the common butterflies, though these are NOT the roller-type. The guide itself is fixed position, similar to the barrel-type guides.I was not aware of the nub that juts out of the bottom of these. As I was unsure of performance and possibly replacing them with rollers or barrel guides, I sanded off the nub so I wouldn't have another set of holes in the headstock. Because of this, there is a slight give, and the guides do rotate with a fair amount of force. Once aligned, though, they stay in place.Overall, these have less friction that the butterfly guides, and hold tension just as well. The headstock on the Ibanez RX20 these went on is much cleaner looking that with the relatively inexpensive-looking butterfly guides."
4,Hitch cover,Seems to be well constructed. Have not used it long enough to see how well it holds up to the weather.
5,Very nice car hitch ornament.,The quality of this item is awesome...and I have received many compliments on this item. I love the Hibiscus flower and this is a pretty good likeness to it...I take it off in the winter...but Spring is here so time to put it back on..love it!
5,Hitch Bling,"This is my second trailer hitch cover. My first one was hit by a lady who rear ended me & the only thing that happened to my vehicle is that the trailer hitch cover broke off, So, it kept my vechicle from having any damage. So, I bought this one because it was the same one as the first. So, If asked if I would buy this product again, I would answer, I already did."
3,"Good book, mainly for young readers","Unlike the Gear books, this is a idylic story where everyone gets along, there are no eneminesIt is a multi generational story from one maternal leader to the next.It does have every day life situations, like birth, death and the thrills of learning new things that either makes life easier, or better.The love scenes are so mild they shouldn't excite young minds."
4,Day To Day Life In Prehistory,"When I downloaded this novel I was looking for a book that showed me how the original American's lived thousands of years ago. This book is not full of intrigue, romance, killing, and gore. It's the story of family life and ties and how Mother Nature provided the things people inventively used to make their homes, clothing, and food for their day to day existence. It tells the story of religion and how the beliefs affected their lives. It explains the close family ties and kinship rituals and beliefs. I enjoyed the book as it gave me a break from the violence found in other novels set in this time period."
2,Not my Favorite,"For some reason I couldn't get past the first third of this book and finally walked away from it. Who knows, I may not have given it a chance and it may have redeemed itself."
4,hank,very good book. It keep you wanting to read on to see what will happen next with thje indian villagers.
4,Sacred Cave,"This book spans 5 generations of woman. Their trials and triumphs. If you enjoy authors like Jean Auel and the husband/wife team W. Micheal Gear and Kathleen O'neal Gear, you will enjoy this book by E.Barrie Kavasch."
1,Not what I expected,"I expected a DVD of vignettes on dining, directions, etc. The DVD is really just a hear and repeat exercise, which I do not find interesting."
4,good if you have the time,this cd is great for people who want to learn japanese over a period of time. it is simple to just play it everyday and even if your not totally into the dvd just hearing the words on an everyday basis will help you catch on.
1,Came damaged,"Probably just got unlucky, but one of the discs was completely messed up, looked like it had been in left out in sun and rain or something. The DVD titles are also pretty low budget, but a movie's a movie, and these are good films, just don't expect a classy box set kinda thing, and be wary of packaging that doesn't protect your DVDs."
4,Well worth it.,"Overall I was very pleased. I didn't give it 5 stars because its missing ""He Got Game"", but all the rest are acounted for. Great for Spike Lee's fans."
5,Great Collection,I'm on a mission to have all or as many of Spike Lee's movies on DVD and this is a great set to have in my collecton.
1,READ FIRST BEFORE BUYING,"In reality, I wouldn't give this product a one star rating. I'd probably give it a three or a four. However, I know that I (and I assume other people) tend to read the one-star ratings before buying something, rather than the better reviews, and I may have an issue with my collection that other people may want to consider before purchasing. My main problem is that of the five movies, two (Clockers and Jungle Fever) contained many 'digital glitches'. Clockers is actually on the verge of being unwatchable because the DVD is of such a low quality. That being said, the remaining movies work perfectly, and I'm sure I'll enjoy them many more times down the road. Yes, it is pretty disappointing that only 3/5ths of the product works, but, in the end, three great movies for $20 is still a great deal."
5,The Marvellous Joints,"It must be hard to understand the real magnitude of the work of Spike Lee without seeing a large exposure of his movies or joints, as he used to call them.For me it was entertaining go to the movies and see any of these joints but with this collection you can appreciate the cameras, the frame, the music, the philosophy, the counter-opposition of a single man that grew in New york.There are black cinema but not in a racist way, in a way where you understood the weight of black people have to carry up."
2,Wrong DVDs,I did not order two of these DVDs. There was only Mo'Better Blues included. I odered the Spike Lee Joint Collection (Clockers/ Jungle Fever/ Do the Right Thing/ Mo` Better Blues/ Crooklyn) package. I did not order Days of Wine and Roses and Casablanca. Please send me the original order. Thank you.
4,"Good, but...","These movies are on double-sided CDs (which I hate) and they also have no, absolutely NO special features. Other than that, these movies are just as pertinent, just as creative as they ever were."
4,Spike Lee Joint Collection (Clockers/ Jungle Fever/ Do the Right Thing...Alfre Woodard,Have all of these on vhs wanted DVD quality. Have not played yet so assume quality is okay since I noticed they are 2 sided discs and i was not aware of this when i ordered
1,Stick and SanDisk,"This is the second one of these we had. The first didn't work out of the box and the second one worked for a week or less. Don't bother. We have several Sandisk MP3 players that work great. I wish we'd stuck with that. This was was even mine, not my kids'. They use the SanDisk and are hard on them."
4,Nextar 2 GB Video MP3,It is a decent mp3 player for what it is. It is easy to upload information and the navigation of music is easy. I have had no problems with it. I just should have looked around a little more before buying because there is so many options. So I gave it a four because I believe that there could have been more to it
1,chazz,This Is the worst mp3 play I have ever had. I bought it to back up my other two an take to the gym. The first nextar didnt work well and when they replaced it the next one was worst. I didn't even to send that one back. just wanted to cut my lost. NEVER AGAIN NEXTAR !
2,this mp3 player is junk,"I bought two of these about a year ago for my kids. The first one broke within two months. The power button snapped off (cheap plastic). The second one will not play all of the songs that are loaded. They show up in the folder but do not play. Every time I sync more songs only a few play and I loose some of the old ones. Its really annoying. Also .. The LCD screen has a big orange blotch in the middle that started out as a dot and just keeps getting bigger! As for the MP4 video player .... don't bother buying this if you want to watch videos, they are very hard to load and look pretty bad. I would suggest buying a ipod .... they are worth the extra money. We also have a $50 Sansa that works great."
2,Warning!,"The product MIGHT be good,but I never had the opportunity to use it. The program loaded witjout problem, but then I received a message indicating that PC DOS 2000 does not support the version of windows that I have loaded. I have Windows 95 and MS Office. No matter what I did I could not load thoses programs, nor could I return to DOS 6.0. In the end I had to reformat Drive C: and completely reload all of my software. There should have been a warning about which versions of software that PC DOS 2000 supports."
3,A little disappointed,"I purchased this product because I thought it would be a good addition to my basement bar area. It's an OK product, but much cheaper in quality based on the price paid. The ""wood"" case is very cheap and the rim for the basketball hoop is also cheap. It ended up bent after a few, not very agressive, plays by my kids. My kids do like this product, but I wonder how long it will last before I have to replace it."
1,I can't believe how addicted I am to this CD,"I have just recently discovered Dave Weckl. Wow, what a breath of fresh air! I have been listening to this album on Rhapsody (a CD listening service) for about a month now. After the kids go to bed, I fire up this CD and work on the computer. This presents a problem in that I can't get to sleep because I have either Crazy Horse or Afrique going over and over in my head. They started out as my favorites, but the others after listening a few times, are now right up there, so today I had to go purchase the CD here at Amazon. (I could download, but I still like Album Covers). I wish he had more guitar work in his recent endevours. The guitar isn't like it is in Rythym of the Soul, but thats for another review. Buy this only if you are not in the need to sleep."
5,It Gets No Better Than This!,"This is not only my favorite Weckl CD, but one of my favorite CDs of all time. When I heard Weckl with Chick's Electric Band I was blown away at his sound. When I heard his compositions on ""Master Plan"" with Jay Oliver, I was Floored. I had no idea this guy was as great a composer as he was a drummer! Not only are these guys masters of their instruments, they are also amazing composers. The rhythms, the melodies, the solos, are all beyond incredible. Jay Oliver is simply the best soloist I have ever heard. His 'mimic guitar' solo in ""Crazy Horse"" is the coolest 'guitar solos' I have ever heard. Whether you play drums, bass, guitar, keys, sax, horns or just love hearing the finest compositions played by the finest musicians, GET THIS CD! You will be BLOWN AWAY!"
2,Hard Wired,"This album almost seems like kind of a confused effort. There doesn't seem to be direction. Yes, top notch musicians but disjointed. I really love Dave's other stuff but not this one."
4,4 musicians only,"Another good-sounding record from the worlds best drummer. More funky and less jazzy are the words for this one. Track no. 5 has one of the best guitarsolos I've ever heard. If you are musician of any kind, listen n' learn. This is how a good drumplayer should sound..."
3,Pass this one by,"I bought this for my then three year old because I thought it would be indestructable. It is still intact but, the metal shelves are hard to get in and out and are still bendable by little hands.It's cute but in hindsite I think I would have bought something else."
1,Bad design,"Joel: I can't believe you had the same problem as us! My husband did the same thing, took it apart only to find cracked plastic and shook his head. I bought it refurbished here on Amazon so chalked it up to that fact. I, too, only do 4 cups of flour at a time at the recommended speed, etc. It completely stopped and screeched at me. I still have my 5 QT KA mixer and will go back to using that one. How can we get a metal gearbox cover, thrust bearings (?), and gears? I'll post on the other website too."
3,Good Devotional,"I would say this ia an average devotional. Not that great but not that bad. I would recommend ""Nightlight for Couples"" by Dr. James Dobson instead. I think there is more discussion between husband and wife with that one."
1,Not useful,"I bought this book along with 2 other books. I do not like this book at all, because I did not find the devotions useful in any way. The devotions are extremely basic, because there is nothing regarding a devotion for couples to learn about their relationship through Christ. There is a verse taken out of the Bible, and then a short explanation of the verse. There was no section in the book that encouraged my husband and I to apply our christian beliefs to our everyday life or to our marriage. This book was recommended to me by my mother, and that is why I bought it. I showed my mother my favorite book out of the three which is ""Devotions for Couples"" by Patrick Morley, and now she plans on buying that devotional instead of the one they are currently using. I just believe there are much more productive and influential books for couples to grow together in their Christian lives than this book. I feel like this book was a waste of my money."
2,At least it's something on DVD,"Man, would I love to see something pro-shot on these guys, but I guess it's not to be, otherwise they wouldn't have put out just this official bootleg stuff. I imagine they've done their best with all the pieces here, most of which were donated by fans, but man, I've seen and heard way better camcorder-recorded stuff than this. I doubt that I'll ever watch it again. There are a couple of nice promo clips from the Symbol of Salvation album included, but overall this is kind of a stinker.C'mon, Saint, put out something good.... the fans deserve it!"
4,Great review for a touching in-depth video,"For any one interested in an accurate depiction of primates in the wild; no people in this video! An honest look at the lives and interactions of a Chimp family through the generations. A touching, dramatic and sad story, narrated by Donald Sutherland. All shot, directed, and put together by the husband of the famed Jane Goodall. A must for conservationists, lovers of apes, and for those who doubt the common ancestory of the human race."
2,Don't bother,"I got this for my husband to help keep his batteries neater and handier. He hates it - in fact, it ended up in the trash. The batteries don't stay in place when the case is closed unless it's completely full. It does have the tester, which I thought would be helpful, but that didn't impress him much either."
3,Not for me,"If you are at all in shape, this video won't do much for you. I don't think I even broke a sweat doing this video. I ended up giving it to my sister. It is probably a good starter workout for people who are just starting to work out and not in very good shape."
2,beginner tae bo,Good sound and picture quality. Needs to spend more time on form. I have watched the beginning several times and am not sure what the difference is between a #1 and #2 punch. The pace is decent but I feel little benifit due to lack of shared knowlage of proper postureS / form.
3,"Basic, Beginner Workout","I found this video to be too easy- I think that intermediate to advanced exercisers would want something more. Billy takes too long 'previewing' the moves and the actual 'Energy' parts (fast, to tempo) are too short. I sweat a lot more doing my other videos, including Turbo Jam and the Firm. I do see how it could be a good video for beginners, though."
1,Where's Season Three????,"This happens more often than not since the release of older tv shows on DVD has become popular. The distributors such as Rhino suck us, the consumers into buying,as an example, seasons one and two of My Favorite Martian and anticipating the scheduled release date for season three. Companies such as Amazon need to start holding the feet of companies like Rhino, to the fire and make them release what is promised on time. DO YOU HEAR ME AMAZON AND RHINO????"
1,Where is Season 3?,im with Mymunster3.no way im buying this!i want season 3!it's the hurry up and wait...
5,Non-coder perspective,The SQL server release by MS is exciting and usable tool for me as a professional business analyst. This book Beginning SQL Server 2005 provides me as a non-coder the ability to leverage these new products in a real working environment. Code snippets are excellent and usable to provide working solutions
3,Beginning SQL Server 2005 Express,"So far, I like the way the book is layed out. I'm still going through it, and satisfied with results."
1,Don't buy this book,"This may be the worst technical book I have ever purchased. It is printed in a very small font with almost no white space so it is very tiring to read. Worse, almost all of the text is wasted. The book needs a good editor. It uses lots of words to say very little and repeats the little it does say endlessly. There are other faults. It continues to use features from the Beta version of the software that the author acknowledges are not in the released version. It does not include a CD, so examples have to be downloaded from a website. The website files are also repetitious, much larger than necessary, and do not include the source for chapter 11 (Chapter 12 is included twice)."
4,Great tool!,"I don't know where to begin with this book. It is such an awesome resource. Although you can get a lot of user documentation online, this book does an excellent job at helping someone new to setting everything up to really understand all of the technical jargon. The examples and explanations for Visual Web Developer and VB are great. However, I wouldn't say this book is completely for the novice, unless you are defining novice as someone proficient in VB programming and web design. And I don't know how useful this will be to an expert either. It's really great for a middle-of-the-road skill-set."
1,Rick Dobson can't write,"It's very hard to read this book. There is very much nonsense text. Many words, sentences, paragraphs, and pages should have been deleted. General nonsense is mixed with crucial information, so you can't skim through passages. Beginner info (like how to install) is mixed with advanced stuff. Repeats endlessly stuff about different versions, etc.. No logic between the paragraphs. Very messy. He often uses unexplained words and abbreviations. It makes SQL look impossible. I will never by a Rick Dobson book again."
4,A nice inexpensive way to see someone far away.,"We recently had a baby. However, most of our family lives out of state. So we bought everyone a Beamer so they can see the baby. It seems to work pretty well. The resolution not super detailed and the frame rate is a little slow, but when you are running through an analog phone, you cannot expect a lot. If you want a more detailed setup then I recommend a web camera on a laptop or one of the service based web phone that use an internet connection (since they have more bandwidth). However, if you want an economical way to video chat that is super easy to use (my family is not that computer savvy), the Beamer is a perfect fit."
2,"Does the job, but has bubbled away from the wall.","Improper installation may be at fault, as it is very difficult to place this wiring against the wall in a straight line without some small curvature getting in. All along the material, it has pulled free from the wall. While it does not hang or sag, it would be terribly cracked had I painted over it. For a material that rips the paint off when making a minor correction, I was surprised at how easily it pulled away from the wall on its own.If it stayed flat against the wall, I would be all for it. As it is, I dread the thought of pulling it back down, as I'm sure the parts that stayed stuck will take half the drywall with them."
1,Too small,"I have a Ford Explorer ,this is a big vehicle. The Mossy Oak accessories are suppoesed to be for outdoorsy 4x4 enthusiasts. The ad states ""fits most visors"" NO ! Maybe for a tiny mini! This thing won't fit ANY visor. Adjustable? I must be missing something, it's just 2 elastic straps on the back. I can get one side or the other to fit, not both. What are you thinking? Not worth returning. I would advise, don't get this if you have an SUV or truck."
4,Terrific writer. Very witty and imaginative.,Steven Womack is an author that you definitely will want to give a serious read. His Harry Denton protagonist is delightfully different. He doesn't really compare to any other private investigator out there. Womack's sharp sense of humor moves the books along at a brisk pace. Easy to see why this book won an Edgar. Hard to fathom why we haven't heard more about this author.
2,Good for Younger Readers,"If you read James Ellroy, Elmore Leonard, etc., this book won't make it for you. But if you're young and starting out in reading this genre, it's not a bad book. (Everybody started somewhere and then advanced - don't worry about it, just read!) I thought I bought this book by mistake and that it was intended for a younger aduience, but apparently this wasn't true. But - YOUNGER READERS - start here! Reading is fun!"
5,Jumbo plain envelopes,These envelopes are perfect for my newspapers and I appreciate the fact that they arrived so quickly. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
2,Not Original Recordings,"The cover of the CD shows an early Hank Thompson all dressed up in his western gear. However, these ""20 Greatest Hits"" were recorded at the Gusto/King studios in 1979. Although they sound great, I would have preferred the original recordings. This should have been mentioned in the product description."
5,Simply Perfection,"This is a must have for in any jazz lover collection. From beginning until the end, I thoroughly enjoyed every track."
5,Great book!,This book was purchased for my sister who has loved reading Anita Stansfield's books. It gave her something to do during the winter months.
1,Card not compatible with PS2 when playing PS1 for backwards compatibility,"For anyone that doesn't know, the PS2 is backwards compatibile allowing for the ability to play great PS1 games. However, you can only save games on a PS1 memory card. Here's the catch, I thought I was getting a deal when buying this 3rd Party memory card (3 cards, wonderful!) - turns out that most PS2s won't even recognize the card at all. I called Sony and they stated that most PS2s have a restriction block that allows it only to read Authentic Sony Memory Cards. So I ended up buying another memory card, this time from Sony, and my PS2 read the card fine and I was finally able to save games for the PS1 game I was playing. Definitely stay away from this product and buy authentic Sony stuff. Smart of Sony to make it tough for 3rd parties to make compatible memory for their consoles."
5,Truely one of the best for Anthony,"I have read tens of thousands of books, but most especially science fiction. I can only attribute my love and fascination for sci-fi to this wondrous work by Piers Anthony! This was my first sci-fi book, but it has not been my last. Anthony's extraordinary ability to describe the incredible alien environment, the beauty of the background and it's entitled creatures was so amazing that I am forced to renew it's wonder regularly. I highly recommend this to all readers!"
3,eh,"This book was disappointing compared to the only other Piers Anthony that I have read- the excellent ""A Spell for Chameleon""."
1,Omnivore on Kindle is Eaten Up by Format And Spelling Mistakes,"A great book (worth 5 stars easily) is totally ruined by the formatting mistakes (or rather, lack of formatting) and the amazing number of misspelled words in it (thus the one star rating). Apparently, it was done by someone who doesn't know how to read or how to format sentences or paragraphs. Extremely disappointing. I hope Piers lays into whoever did this."
3,Disappointed with Kindle version,"I first read this novel in the 80's at my school library, but then I could never find it again. I was excited when I saw that it was available on Kindle and bought it immediately. However, the kindle text is disappointing. There are many misspellings and unecessary word breaks. I have yet to find a single paragraph without one of these errors. They are extremely distracting and detracting."
4,An interesting start for a saga,"A sound read about an alternate world if it specified the time of the setting.Nonetheless,the action and plot is just right."
1,Buyer Beware,"This card is ready to go, as long as you only want to use one of the two USB ports. If you actually want to use *both*, you have to supply external power via a DC converter that plugs directly into the card... and which is not supplied with the product. This is not mentioned anywhere in the product description online.Buyers should also be aware that the drivers come on a minidisk, which not all cd/dvd drives will read."
1,Historical romance mistakenly published as a Regency,"Some rakes may be redeemable, but the hero of this story is WAY too far gone. In the author's previous book, ""A Dangerous Compromise,"" he was the villain who was prevented from forcing the heroine's compliance by drugging her with opium when the hero arrived in a timely manner.Ms. Donnelly, what WERE you thinking???Another problem is the fact that the hero and heroine live together for a year before marrying. Oh, I'm sure that real lords occasionally married their mistresses during the Regency period, but not without a great deal of scandal. A ""happy-ever-after"" ending in this situation seems rather doubtful.Frankly, this sort of plot line is not appropriate for a Regency; Ms. Donnelly should try writing full-length historicals if this is what she wants to do."
2,Could have been good...,I liked the idea of the characters but their development was awkward and not easy to follow. It is one thing to incorporate mystery or intrigue but the components still need to flow together. The editing (or lack thereof) and poor grammar and spelling were more than annoying. I enjoyed the Gypsy and Earl interplay but wish the personalities of the characters could have been more fully developed. It may be worth a read if you don't mind the grammar and spelling issues and can pick it up cheap as I did.
3,Far Too Many Editing Errors,"The storyline for this novel is good. I don't want to give away the plot, but suffice it to say that it is a typical ""bored aristocrat meets beautiful and proud woman seeking to right a wrong.""The low evaluation is based upon the publishing company's editing of this story. The person who edited this tale could neither spell, write a grammatically correct sentence, avoid typos, or refrain from transposing words or phrases! It was a travesty! I often had to reread sentences several times to make sense of them.There were far too many editing errors to make this an easy and pleasant read...as it should have been."
2,Should have ended sooner,"If you do not like endings which are out of character for the regency period, then this book is not for you. I have gotten rid of my copy of it for this reason."
1,It's more for crooner's than rappers...,"This is not what I was expecting. It's just like all the other rhyming dictionaries out there. Matter of fact, it actually has less pages and entries than a standard rhyming dictionary (only 184 pages). The only difference with this book is that it has ""Hip-Hop"" in the title and includes some expired urban slang words."
5,Word!,"Yo kids...Put down that game of PictionaryCuz I got this Rhyming DictionaryWith ""Five Tips for Better Writing""'fore too long I'll be incitingWhen 'account' goes with 'paramount'It's 'tantamount' to a money 'count'Me'll be puffin' 'cigar' and 'caviar'With every damn 'czar' of 'A & R'Admire, amplifier, aspireAcross, moss, rhinocerosActual, contractual, factualEverything will soon be satisfactual"
4,A big help,This book makes it so easy to write lyrics. I've tried other rhyming dictionaries and they are too convoluted. This is one of the best out there.
3,not as high quality as you would expect at this price,"I am using these to store cd's that I'm not ready to part with yet and though they look good, I was disappointed in the quality. With nothing inside the material on the sides and bottom of the box is not a whole lot studier than a tissue box. The lid is much better with it's reinforced edge, which allows you to stack them, but since these cost twice as much as the snap together boxes I expected more. In my opinion, the only reason to buy these is for the looks, otherwise the snap together boxes or a Rubbermaid box both offer the same or better quality."
4,Overall happy,Looks good but the cartboard is not as hard as I imagined it would be. I am glad I made this purchase
4,54 well spent minutes - every time,"I think this is about their fifth record, recorded in 1969, along with four extra songs from records made in 68 and a live cut from a festival in '73. It features traditional songs from Chile, Bolivia and Ecuador-(those probably brought by Max Berru) along with compositions by several other folk musicians and only one piece (an instrumental) by the band. While some of the cuts may seem a bit antiquated now, the political pieces earned the band a 15 year exile from Chile by Nixon's boyfriend Pinochet, and still mean something in a world that has not changed as much as they and we would have hoped. This is not my favorite Inti Illimani album but it has been on my 5 disc changer for most of the month since i got it and shows no sign of collecting dust soon. I'm grateful that they made it for us. - den belillo"
2,This is not the Larry Carlton you probably know,"If you're expecting Larry Carlton, the jazz guitarist you will be unhappy with this one. This is all blues, and as a blues CD it probably deserves to be rated a 3 star CD, but I felt ""had"" when I popped this one in the player so I dropped it to a 2 star. This shouldn't have been labeled ""by Larry Carlton, featuring Terry McMillan"" it should have included some inference to Blues and a stronger influence of Terry McMillan. You will get plenty of harmonica and a whole lot of slowhand guitar which may be right for some. Carlton should be applauded for taking the risk, but for me, this didn't cut the mustard."
5,If you love to Jam.. GET THIS CD!,"This album is a southern fried/blues recording, which features tasteful guitar from Larry and jamming harmonica and vocals from Terry McMillian. It is not jazz oriented like Larry's other albums are, but more straight up rock and blues. I'm a Carlton fan and love his records, but this timeless classic is awesome (clean too!)."
4,From a Terry McMillan fan,"As a harmonica player and Terry McMillan fan I bought this CD to hear Terry in a different setting than I'm used to. He was, until his death in 2/07 at the age of 53, THE Nashville session harp player (he was also a percussionist and wonderful singer). He was also big on the Christian music circuit. Check out his videos on YouTube. He's incredible. His own Christian-based CDs are excellent. On this Larry Carlton CD Terry fits in well with the various blues/rock/jazzy grooves that Larry Carlton lays down. If you like Southern rock and roll you'll probably like this record and if you like jazz rock you will like it as well. Larry Carlton can definitely rock out. Fans of Terry McMillan might wish that he sang more and was turned up a bit more in the mix on the bluesier tunes. Blues harmonica players that don't know about Terry- check him out! Terry McMillan- God bless your soul."
4,It was the food the pet store was feeding my dog,This is the food the pet store was feeding my dog (miniature pinscher)and they recommended that I keep feeding him the same food to prevent diareah.I like that this dog food has so many good ingredients in it. I definitely don't want to start my puppy's life with low-quality food. Looking to buy online since it is $16.99 for 5-lb bag at the pet store.
2,Too much information on a card,"I like flashcards to be simple so that I can just go through a stack of them quickly when I have a little spare time. Some of the cards have far too much information on them. Also, the small size makes them difficult to handle."
3,Advanced students only,"These cards are suitable for advanced Spanish students only. They are very comprehensive, great for extensive revision and I will use them when I've learned a little more. Good value for money, but if you are a beginner - buy the Pimsleur Comprehensive CDs and get on with it!"
5,fun way to learn Spanish,These cards enable my wife and I to learn Spanish interactively. I recognize more and more words each day.
3,Flimsy,Small flimsy cards. At least they fit in your wallet. Not the quality I was expecting. Includes a useful card index to find the words you're looking for.
5,A great book,"This is one of the best chess books I have. It is incredibly clear and well written. Don't be deterred by the ""Starting Out"" name-- I can't imagine anyone with a rating under 2000 not being able to learn a whole lot from it. I have something like 120 chess books. Most of them sit on the shelf. Not this one, I am constantly pulling it out. Hell, even if you don't play the Alekhine as black and don't open with 1. e4 as white, I would still get this book."
5,Wonderful,"My family spreads this all over chunks of red potatoes, and roasts them in the oven. Absolutely delicious! This is how mustard is supposed to be."
5,individual channels rock,"This is my 2nd charger of this model since 2001. I got tired of carrying the only one I had around, and having to dig it out of my luggage to use at home. Charges fast, charges individually, perfect for the plethora of gadgets that take 3 batteries, and most chargers only charge in pairs.The current model shipping uses a ""switching type"" light weight wall wart for power, instead of the heavy transformer type that fall out of loose power outlets.Now if there was only a way to rejuvenate abused NiMh batteries, instead of just having the ""blinky red light"" means time to recycle a 6 week old battery....."
3,Nothing Special,So far this looks like just another charger and just another set of batteries.....they do not perform any better than the ones they replaced...
3,Useful Guide,"I bought a couple of guides to help me redo a large garden at a house we'd bought - the garden had fallen into neglect.No guide is perfect, and I've found that it may be simpler to experiment and talk to neighbors. I've found that all guides are fallible in the way they describe plant hardiness, sun requirements, and so on. Helpful, but visit a local garden center and get some direct advice first."
1,ANOTHER REISSUE PRETENDING TO BE NEW,"This is ANOTHER REISSUE. Any poor fan of this author who looked at your site and orders by mail is likely to be FOOLED! This is highly irritating and a shameful practice, Amazon. It's fraud."
3,Good solid read for a lazy day.,"This story is very much in the Doylist style. It has a very classic mystery format which put me to mind of the Sign of Four. Fast paced, interesting characters. The only flaws would be that Holmes presence tantalizes in its absence and everyone is way to good a makeup artist."
1,What was wrong with the old title?,"I loved this book. The first time. When I bought it under the title Good Morning Irene. I don't appreciate buying a book that I think is new only to discover that it is a reissue with a new title. Frankly, I think it is a legal way to cheat book buyers."
4,Fair speaker stand,"Pros: Easy assembly, not too heavy but sturdy enough to hold an 11 pounds bookshelf speaker on without problems, nice look, adjustable height from 31"" to 45, cable management systemCons: Pricey, clamp style speaker adapter doesn't tilt and speaker slide off clamp base very easy, need to be secured with velcro pads provided.Overall it's a good product with a nice look and aesthetics"

1,Not Interesting,I would not see this film again. It was slow to start and slow moving throughout. Good luck viewing it.
3,Good but poor fabric quality,"These knee gaskets do work well and keep my knee pads in place. I find they run small in comparison to other brands, but my major complaint is that the metal bracing/boning keeps ripping through the fabric on the side. I've tried re-sewing them and I just get new holes. Duct tape is the only thing holding my gaskets together anymore. I've only had them for about three months and I skate twice a week. It seems a little soon for them to be falling apart."
3,Why Knee Gaskets?,Knee gaskets work well to give extra support and prevent kneepads from sliding off on a huge bail.
4,"they're no Smith Scabs, but they're pretty good.","pretty good. still using them, can't say much though for the knee pads. could've been a little more snug, but they'll do."
2,April Gold not one of Hill's better efforts,"SYNOPSIS: When their father dies and they lose everything in a bank crash, Marilla and Thurlow, along with their aging mother, must somehow scrape a living in an economically depressed America. They move to a poor, working class community, and their efforts to live clean, godly lives slowly influence their neighbors for good.MY OPINION: I'm a fairly big fan of Grace Livingston Hill, and I don't think this is one of her better books. The split focus between Thurlow, Marilla, and their mother means no one character's story flourishes with the detail it needs. The romance aspect was particularly underdeveloped.I read Hill mostly for cultural detail--the window into the past. However, this volume did contain a good deal of discussion of spiritual matters, so if this is your favorite aspect of Hill's writing, you may enjoy this book more than I did."
3,okay,has most of the tools i wanted but not happy that you have to put things back together when you are done using it and the glue dries way to fast to be able to use it.and don't like the scrapper not thin enough. Also when using the knife if you push to hard it just pops out which is really annoying.
3,Not the original Platters,I was surprised this was not the original Platters. Hence the disappointment! Anyway it still brings back thememories of the Great Platters!
1,Not original songs hits!,"Im a child of the 60's but was blessed with a hip MOM who always played current music on the stereo and thank heavens she indoctrinated me with the sweet as honeysuckle sexy pleading voices and music of The Platters. Once heard in the original naked form, theirs is a sound that in my humble opinion, simply cannot be replicated....and this recording in no way shape or form does that! These arrangements are completely unfamiliar to me - please be aware of this type of brand reformatting when shopping for music."
2,They don't sound like the Platters of my day.,They do not sound the same as I remember from my days as a teenager. I noticed this when I played the samplebut was unable to cancel the order soon enough.
1,not what I expected,Im old enough to have heard the ORIGINAL recordings. This CD was absolutely brutal.These were NOT the recordings I heard as a teenager. Too bad i threw the box sway or i would hav returned it. First time this has happend to me at Amazon
3,End Of... They Wish....,"Don't get me wrong, I am a huge My Little Pony Collector myself. However, I will not be tricked into buying something that I've already bought.For those of you, out there, who've purchased the Season 1 Dvd Box Set, you will have no need for this one. I know for a fact that these episodes are on the first disc... I watched them with my nephew and niece.Of course, I'm only going by what the description says on this one. Queen Bumble and The Witches, sounds like the one dvd I've watched. For those Collectors that must own everything... go ahead a get it. I'm just letting you know that this is just a chunk sliced out of Season 1."
2,I didn't really like this one...,"If you have the complete first season of the tv show, don't bother buying this because you already have it.Now, on to the review itself. I LOVE My Little Pony, no doubts there. However, I found this particular story kind of boring. It wasn't bad, it just felt out of place and was kind of silly. The original piolet special and ""Escape From Catrina"" were excellent, however I was really bored trying to watch this one. The witches were absolutely ridiculous and their voiceovers bothered me more than anything. The bees were stupid (sorry), especially the one they made to look kind of like a biker punk.Sorry, but My Little Pony has a lot better to offer out there. But if you really want it, get the first season, that way you have something to compensate it with."
4,My Little Pony - End of Flutter Valley,This movie wasn't quite up to par vs. other My Little Pony Movies as far as the storyline went. Good quality as far as the picture and sound were concerned.
4,MY LITTLE PONY,"THE DVD WAS IN GOOD SHAPE, UNOPENED,SCRATCH FREE. MY GRANDDTR. IS ENJOYING IT VERY MUCH. IT'S A JOY TO BRING THESE SHOWS BACK TO LIFE FOR A YOUNGER GENERATION."
2,Terrible!,"I saw the MLP movie and then I got this and was shocked. The witches have the stupidest voices ever! The original voices were SO much better. Even I can do the voices from the REAL movie. Also, the animation has TOO MANY GLITCHES!!!"
4,My Little Ponies are great for little girls,"The fact that adults are sitting around contemplating whether or not this video is fit for children is ridiculous. This video talks about playing with others, teamwork, and is a fun entertainment experience for children. If you are one of those that goes overboard on analyzing videos, this might not be for you. But if you love your children, and want them to enjoy themselves this is a good movie. If you are price concious though, you can buy the entire first season for a cheaper price."
3,Decent workout for beginners,"I'm a big fan of Tae Bo and found this workout not as hard as the bootcamp series or the original Tae Bo Advanced workouts. However, if you want an easier workout or are new to Tae Bo, I'd recommend this. You can use small, weighted balls with the workouts, which increases toning."
3,Decent workout,"The workout was a good one, however I personally had a hard time keeping up sometimes -- Not because it was too hard, but because his feet were all over the place. More then likely it was my fault for being uncoordinated. The workout can still be felt today, the morning after. However, I don't know that I would personally pay money for this tape (I borrowed it). Also, it requires the Tae Bo balls, which I didn't have, so I couldn't do a small portion of the workout. This tape included 2 workouts."
3,Vipers Skiffle Group,Reference the DVD of the Vipers Skiffle GroupThe product is just what I wanted. It was the music I was involed in in the late 1950's.The order was promptly handled and the item arrived earlier than I imagined.
2,"flat, boring story of crime and secrets kept from spouses..","Alfred Alverez's ""Day of Atonement"" is a thankfully short, boring book on how a middle aged couple Joe and Judy deal with the death of their friend, the shady Tommy Apple. Soon, they are headed into a world of covert police maneuvers, and seedy crime operations. Ending not a big surprise, but a big bore nonetheless"
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book. I do not have the scientific background to comment on the research value but the main points seemed too much based on one exceptional case study. Actually, the author's lambasting of the anonymous reviewer reflects the self-indulgent and narcissistic tone of the work. By the way, have you noticed how the positive reviews of this manuscript copy the easy flowing style of the author? Remarcable."
1,Misleading,"There is a fundamental paradigm shift in inNutrition that says eating more fats is healthier for humans than previously thought.This author tries to take advantage of that trend with the title. However upon reading you discover that the author is pushing a low fat way of eating. As I said ""misleading""."
3,Sentimental,"This book has some good parts, particularly the autobiographical stories. But it would be foolish to generalize from such individual and subjective experience. Mr. Bayan is a man with a cause."
4,Cool book,This book is not a boring read for a factual book that makes you think. I don't like reading textbooks so the author does an amazing job.
5,uncle eric gives you the secret to a world of profit.,"In this excellent book Uncle Eric provides you with all of the facts about cones.What they are, how to find them, and how you can make a profit from them.Uncle eric shares many examples of cones through history especially the history of the clipper ship. Also included with each history overview is the summary of what those who found the cones did to profit from them. This i find to be an extreemely useful item within the book. Uncle eric does not only tell you what to do, he shows you actual instences in history when the cones were taken advantadge of.Along with uncle erics guide to finding cones he also has a description of what types of cones there are, and which ones to get into and which ones to stay out of.I find all of uncle erics advice to be extreemely useful in this book.sincerely Piffer H"
4,HP Ipaq,The unit takes just a bit to get familiar with but seems to work well.The 802.11x function is a little lacking in a Holiday Inn but at home on our wireless access point it works nicely.Overall it is a good product.
2,More than gently used,"I was excited to receive this classic children's book, however, when I opened it up, it was in very bad shape. None of the pages were attached to the binding, and there was more than just a visible little wear and tear. I wish it were sold in better shape or that at least the seller would have been honest with the condition of the product."
2,Cheap,This coat rack is not well-made. Mine does not stand straight and many of the pre-drilled holes were poorly made. It works and is probably worth what I paid.
2,"Cheap and looks nice, but poor quality and ultimately not worth it","It's hard to resist the price. But you should. The rack isn't worth it.After a year of use, the coat rack is basically useless. The problem is that the stand is extremely unstable and is likely to tip over unless you consistently ensure that the weight is distributed evenly over the various hooks. We've had the rack tip over multiple times. Twice, when the rack tipped over one of the hooks broke off. Now, as you can imagine, this creates a large problem. Since the item is unstable at the best of times, it becomes enormously unstable when you have fewer hooks across which to distribute the weight of the hanging items. So, at this point, our coat rack is basically unusable.It's too bad. The rack looks nice and is well-priced. If it was better balanced, this would be a steal."
1,Fell apart in less than a week-zero stars,"This item looks nice, however, it fell apart in less than a week. I had to rate it one star because of system limitations. It deserves zero stars."
4,It meets or exceeds the OEM,"Its a handsome little guy that helps you stop smoothly when replaced in pairs. What else can I say about a brake rotor. It works like new oem & the quality exceeds auto parts stores ""value"" rotors."
3,Misled/Fooled/Hoodwinked/Tricked,"I ordered this movie as the Peter Finch 1957 version but I got this. And Amazon claims this is always what was advertised. I've got no way to prove any different. But I was searching and searching and searching for the Peter Finch version. I already had this thing, I certainly didn't want it again.And I found it! And I ordered it. And this turned up. So what's the conclusion? If they're right then I must be going insane, suffering from hallucinations and dementia.... But I don't think so.Anyway, this movie: it's okay. But it is not a patch on the original (black and white, 1957) Peter Finch version. Just the characters - Bryan Brown is an entirely different character to Peter Finch. And the Shiralee entirely different.I'd say join me in my search for the original."
3,Hidden Costs,"No criticism of the product, just the cost. The product had to be delivered to the UK. I paid Amazon a $6.48 Shipping & Handling fee. When the package arrived in the UK I was asked to pay a further 12.76 (approx. $20.00) made up of VAT & Royal Mail International Handling Fee, before I could take delivery of the package. This means in total I paid $62.47 for the DVD - too much & not worth it !"
1,How Neusner Misrepresents Steinsaltz,"No doubt Mr Neusner, whose career has gotten some traction from Pope Benedict XVI, wanted to get some traction on the back of Rabbi Steinsaltz, who is the very soul of Torah. As a ""Reform Rabbi"" -which means somewhat rather than really observant- or a Jewish revisionist, one can only presume that Neusner is critiquing Steinzaltz on what he tinks is an intellectual level, rather than a spiritual one.However, since he has a well-known tendency to set up straw men only to give himself a chance to knock them down -like his book ""A Rabbi Talks With Jesus""- one must take anything he writes with more than a grain of salt."
1,Come Off It!,"When I was in yeshivah, the Mashgiach sometimes used to ask those of us who used the Hebrew Steinsaltz gemaras in addition to the regular ones what ""the Rav"" had to say. Although he was a Chassidic rabbi far removed from the academic world, he spoke of Rav Steinsaltz with the greatest reverence. Who is Prof. Neusner to critique a talmid chokhom of Rav Steinsaltz's stature in the first place? The Mishnah states that one should not speak in the presence of greater scholars."
1,MISLEADING CD DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL TRACKS,I have the domestic release of this cd- But it does not contain Hiding Under Water or Lay Your Hands On Me- So I found the import that I bought through DVD LEGACY- THE WORST SELLER! DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER- THEY SUCK! AND THE CD OF COURSE DID NOT HAVE EITHER OF THE TRACKS ON IT- SOOOO THE QUESTION IS WHERE ARE THEY? HAS ANYONE FOUND THE LIVE RECORDING OF THESE SONGS ON A CD?
4,WHAT'S MISSING?,"Not much but where's Hiding Under Water man??? This CD is just the CD version of the previously released DVD. However, it does NOT include Hiding Under Water or Lay Your Hands On Me which she played at that concert and are on the DVD version. I'm especially bummed about Hiding Under Water not being included in this collection. I could have done w/o Beth's version of Zepplin's Whole Lotta Love and would have loved to have had Hiding Under Water instead. I don't believe this song is on any of her other efforts you can purchase. Beth's performance is outstanding, she is an incredible vocalist and performer, every song kicks *ss! The band is also excellent. Beth & Co. get 5 stars but, because they left out two good tunes, the CD gets 4 stars."
2,Beth Hart Live at Paradiso,The talent and soulful voice I heard from Beth when she did Don't Explain w/Joe Bonamassa was missing from this cd. In this live edition she seems to be screamimg more than singing. I have listened to it several times and never enjoyed it. I would not buy another BH llive and would not buy another BH w/out listening to it firts. Huge disappointment.
2,Not as good as I expected,I though she could have done allot better. I was not impressed with the quality of the songs chooices.It as though the concert was recorded in mid stream. though I did enjoy the reboot of a classic Led Zep tune.
1,Disappointing,"I bought this DVD knowing nothing about Billy Blanks and his background. Big mistake! First, the exercises are made with a little ball that you have to purchase separately (something I did not do). Second, the routines are not preceded by any sort of explanatory segment, so you get right into it without having learned proper techniques. Finally, I have to stay I cannot stand the way he makes participants yell ""Power!"" every couple of minutes."
2,ONLY 1 GOOD REMIX,THE FIRST REMIX IN THE CD IS A RADIO EDIT VERSION IS AROUND 3 AND HALF MINUTES IT'S ONLY WORTHY FOR REMIX #3.
3,Purina One Hairball Formula Cat Food,"It doesn't seem to reiieve the buildup of hairballs as expected. Pet still develops hairballs to the point of not being able to eat without regurgitating. After several days of regurgitation, the problem seems to ease and we are off and running okay for a couple of weeks and then the same cycle repeats itself. Wii seek further professional advice."
5,My cat loves this product,My cat had a terrible problem with hairballs. At least once a week I was cleaning up the results of this problem. YUCK!! Now since using this product there are very few such episodes for which both I and kitty are thankful. Will continue to use this product and having it delivered to my door is nice and also the good price but that's true with everything I get from Amazon!
3,"Same as in the store, just cheaper","My husband and I are pretty busy people, and there's nothing I hate more than spending what little free time we have running to the pet store to get pet food. With Amazon Subscribe and Save, we are able to get this delivered right to our front door at the same (or lower) cost of running to the pet store or market.This particular formula seems to be fine for our 2 spoiled felines. We switch them back and forth between this, Chicken and rice, and Indoor formula and I haven't seen an increase or decrease in hairball activities. They seems to still have the occassional hairball, but I think that's pretty typical.For the price I feel that this brand and formula provide a good diet and nutrients that our furbabies need."
5,Cat's love it and no more hairballs!,"No more vomit to clean up in the morning and my cats can't wait for their nightly ""treat"" of dry food."
1,Survived!,"This 7 lb bag was packed in the same box with other smaller more fragile items. It survived quite well; the 0.5 oz tube of eye cream, loose in the same shipping box, did not! So the moral of this story is that my cat will eat well, and my crow's feet are still alive and kicking!"
2,Not What I Ordered,"I ordered Hairball Healthy Weight formula and I got plain Hairball formula. Purina doesn't make it easy by fielding so many products, only a few of which are likely to be in any given store, but my order clearly says Hairball AND Healthy Weight (which is what my cats are used to) and that's not what I've got."
1,An embarrassing travesty,"I hadn't read five pages of this book before I realized it was a totally fictional account with no basis in fact. I don't mind historical fiction, but this portrayal of Dietrich Bonhoeffer bears no resemblance to the man or those who knew him best. I would be embarrassed to have published a book about a person with so little desire to be truthful or consistent with that life. The fact that she left out the person who knew him best other than his family is indicative of faithfulness with which she approached the subject."
4,"A well-written novel, and definitely a novel","Denise Giardina is a gifted writer and I admired this story of the life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. However, I didn't see the man who wrote ""The Cost of Discipleship"" and other theological works in her descriptions. No one in the book is really a saint (with the possible exception of George Bell) and actually no one is a villain either. The Nazis are evil but there wasn't much said of what we know of their villainy. I did admire the writing and research of Ms Giardina but I wish I really knew what Bonhoeffer was like. I think he had to have more strength than was pictured here."
4,Great introduction (only) to the life of Bonhoeffer.,"Great introduction into the life of a facinating man, but seriously lacking in portraying an acurate sense of his beliefs. Read ""Letters and Papers from Prison"" to find out how this modern man really understood the connection between a truly Christ centered life while living through the nadir of human existence as represented by Nazi Germany. I don't believe that this book comes close to understanding Bonhoeffer's theology and faith. Giardina seems to filter his theology through a 90's social/cultural perspective. What's left is only a shallow portrayal of this man of faith. The value of the book to me is that it made me want to know more. Still, it was a very good read, providing an interesting sense of the insidiouness of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s. Check out the Bonhoeffer home page for more about this modern saint."
2,"""Cup of Wrath"" is much better","Before I read this book I had just read ""Cup of Wrath"" by Mary Glazner and though the later was a much better portrait of Bohnoeffer, has friends and family, and was a much better written version of the German mindset during the Nazi rise to power. This book was fine, but the dialogue was very unprofound and seemed too-well scripted. Much of the words the author puts in Bohnoeffer's mouth felt ...unconvincing. Many of the scenes, such as the scene were Dietrich's black friend is refused service, come off overly-contrived and riddled with cliche. I also didn't find the writing to be incredibly sophisticated and the overall book didn't leave me thinking much. It almost seemed like it was written for more of a young adult audience? Overall: there is a much better product out there."
5,Better than expected,I was surpised how well it worked for the price. I have been using it for about two weeks and it took a couple days to get used to but it is helpful to achieve alter states of consciousness or just a relaxing state.It has 21 pre programs and you can either use you own CD's or the audiostrobe CD's to create your own light/ sound session. Also a helpful tool for the Ganzfeld experiment.
2,No closed eye visuals in spite of my dreams to the contrary...,"I wish it worked as I expected that it would.In the 2000's (when it was still cool) I used a red-lit dreammachine and was blown away at the trippy experience...I was on ecstacy on that occasion. I do enjoy meditation but found the lights to be distracting, ALMOST as distracting as the anticipation I experienced waiting for the closed-eye-visuals to begin. Alas, disappointed on both counts, the lights never let my eyes relax and the visuals never visited me...maybe I need some illicit drugs...hmmmm but with those, I don't need these.Also, I expected two colors, (white as listed) and red....no luck I got white and blue instead. Oh well, it goes back tomorrow bc it doesn't help me relax. Although it does flash lights and play sounds, like I guess I expected."
1,Poor design = frustrating device,Don't get me wrong - I LOVE what this machine can do. But I don't use it as often as I would like.Why?The wires.Too many wires = too many tangles = I have to spend 5 minutes fighting the wires before and sometimes after I use the machine. And it's a major annoyance. You will see what I mean.The only remedy is unplug all the wires and pack the machine up after each use. Which is not generally something you want to do after using the machine.If Mindplace decides to somehow remedy the problem it's a five-star item.
5,Motivational,"The author lays out many, many ideas in this book. While reading, my mind was constantly asking if that idea was for me or not. This book motivated me to consider other ideas. Jay Conrad Levinson challenges readers to turn these ideas into opportunities by acting on them immediately. He truly is a guerrila marketer."
4,THE CHECKLISTS ARE WORTH THE PRICE ALONE,"While I didn't actually get any practicle directing techniques from this kit, I wasn't actually looking for any either. Anyone who thinks they can learn to direct from a book, shouldn't be directing in the first place. The kit has several checklists and forms that are a great resource for the new and more experienced director. It also serves as a solid outline of what is or should be involved with directing. It won't teach you how to direct, but then again, that's not the intent."
1,Waste of money,It's really a book for amateurs. Most of the tips you can find out yourselves by a little logical thinking.
2,We Get What We Pay For,"Someone else stated that the purchase is a waste of money. Maybe, but I've wasted more on other things and gotten less.Yes, the movies are old and, by today's standards, pretty cheap and cheesy. But as long as you know what you're getting it can be fun.BTW- I didn't see the Charles Bronson I was expecting and suspect there was an old English actor by the same name."
1,Very very bad quaility.,"Most of the items on the disk are so compressed they show artifacting at any screen size, sound horrible for most. Since everything on here seems to be public domain, you are better off doing a web search to find better quaility. Don't waste you time and money on this crap, like I did."
4,sampuran vastu shastra,"the vastu sama its the mos great expression of the vedic energy balance. This book is a genenuine work of indian traditional and ancient science of pure, vital and healthly art of vital forces in our domestic world."
1,Too Big!!!,This case is way too big for the CyberShot DSC-W80 camera. The camera will bounce around inside it. I returned it to the vendor. I will get a skin case for the camera.
3,kroo is ok,"This case is bigger than I thought it would be. But I feel that my camera is really safe in it. I guess I can't complain. I just wish it still came in lavander. It's not a bad product though. It does what it's ment to do. Maybe a longer string so I can hang it from my wrist. Other than that, it's ok."
3,good product,"This is a good solid camera case. However, it is a bit bigger than what I expected for my Sony W80 Cyber-shot camera."
5,Camera case,We got this camera case to give for a Christmas gift and she was very pleased. It was a little larger than the camera but it will protect the camera from being damaged when carrying it. She carries it in the car all the time so it does get moved around a lot and the solid case will protect it better than the soft side.
3,Did not include the protector kit + cloth,"The case itself is find and fits my Sony Cyber shot camera as I was hoping it would. One of the reasons I ordered this particular case, though, is that it was said to include a LCD Screen Protector Kit + Cloth. My case came without any such kit."
3,Strictly for a camera only,"The case is great, love the variety of colors and the durability of the product, my only ""but"" is that although it has an inner pouch that suggest that you can put an extra memory card or battery in it, you actually can't without squishing your camera and forcing the zipper to shut."
2,Nebulous,"The book is well organized, and offers much information, but it somehow misses the intented impact that the author promises. It has mass but is still a ""light-weight""."
1,Not what you are expecting,What arrived is not a heavy duty KD style but the standard Wal-Mart style blue and white lightweight circular floating dispenser. It is adequate and makes the return process too much of a hassle but would be nice to get what you order
5,"Wonderful, moving book for anyone who loves animals","I received this book as a gift, and plan to purchase copiesto give as well.Each page or two tells of a dog who touched a service man'sheart, of the impact they had on their life.I loved that at the beginning of each story is a photo of thedog, sometimes with the person telling their story.Just wonderful ... absolutely heartwarming."
5,"Excellent ""real time"" documentay of 3rd Reich era.",The documentary reveals much of the philosophical and economical ambilvalences prevalent among many circles concerning the mission of the NSDAP.
1,Incomplete,"Many wrox books are great, but this one was a disappointment. As an ""classic ASP"" developer I found the examples unhelpful and impractical, the information spread out, the request and response object - used constantly in classic ASP - were so poorly explained I still have no idea how they function in ASP.net. I am sure that ASP.NET has many important benefits that make it superior to Classic ASP, but after reading almost 600 pages (!) I feel I do not understand how to achieve the same result I can easily get in Classic ASP. Not recommended."
3,Purchase this according to your skill set,"I have heard that ASP.NET is completely different from ASP, so I decided to go ahead and purchase this book despite the fact that I have been programming ASP for a long time. I have also purchased Professional ASP.NET. If you are an advanced programmer in ASP and VB, I think Professional ASP.NET will give you more than enough knowledge to start programming in ASP.NET w/ VB.NET or C#. From what I can tell, Professional ASP.NET captures much more in depth on each topic. If you are not familier with web-based application & VB language in general, I think this book will help you understand basics."
2,Disappointing technology,"This book does not look like from Wrox, it got only the bad side of Wrox books - put code on dark background to damage readers' vision.The usefulness of this book are the examples, while the explanations are not all good. There are 13 authors for this book, the quality of each part of this book differ a lot. Unfortunately, the most importance parts for me: the OOP part and Control part, got the lowest quality. The technology used in these two parts is: put some words there but no real explanation on many important points; simply repeat the sample code to fill out the pages. This is more damaging because of readers' trust on Wrox books, I invested lots of time on this book without questioning, then I found I wasn't going anywhere."
2,Outdated -- Poor Level Of Detail,"The book is well outdated (as of mid-2004).I'm just finishing the Begining ASP.NET with VB.NET 2003. This was Wrox's suggestion as the follow-on book to really understand website database development. A real waste. The Begining ASP.NET provided the same level of detail.The book did use SQL Server -- a plus -- which the Begining ASP.NET book lightly covered. But, not enough to justify the expense of buying the book and even more importantly the time to wade through it."
3,A bit of a disapointment,"I have been a fan of wrox books in the past, but this is not one if their better ones. The writing was poor overall, and there were times where I read the infomration three times before I eventually started to search the internet for a better explaination. The chapters on xml were useful, but could have gone into a little more detail with simple ways to data bind instead of focusing on datagrids as a single solution. As a resource, the index is useless and no glossary to organize key concepts to reference was a disapointment."
1,Not nearly as good as the ASP 2,"I am a developer and teach sometimes as well. The book on ASP 2 was great. Easy to read and the students could understand it. This new book on ASP.NET is nothing like the old one. Explaining XML in the first few chapters is a waste of time, especially if you will not use it until chapter 20. It also doesn't explain things well. Since server controls are an important part of ASP.NET, I expected a lot of detail and examples. Having a single chapter with almost useless examples is not enough. I enjoyed looking at examples that had many properties that were not explained and tags that were not explained. It does not go into the Response, Request objects clearly. The explanation and use of Application and Session variables was pathetic. All in all, I would NOT recommend this book to a person who want to learn ASP.NET well, not even a beginner."

3,CORELLE TRAYS,"I BOUGHT THESE BECAUSE THEY MATCHED THE KITCHEN SET I'VE HAD FOR YEARS, AND I NEEDED SOME T.V. TRAYS FOR LUNCH AND DINNER EATING....THEY ARE DURABLE, EASY TO CLEAN BUT VERY SLIPPERY...SO...I COVERED THEM WITH PLACEMATS ATTACHED BY VELCRO..."
2,lousy image quality and the tray surface is not even flat,"I needed a tray for appetizers and such and thought, since i have this pattern already, that I'd try this tray. I don't know if I ended up with a second but it's very disappointing. the image quality is awful, off pattern and muddy colors. The tray is not even flat."
4,"same book, different cover","When the book came, I realized I owned it in hardcover. I passed it on because it is valuable for sharing an artist's eye of the world. He is a master of color."
4,I Went Home And Found . . .,"For many, it seems, the relationship between child and parent is one of the most difficult as the child matures into an adult. Parents often have a difficult time letting go of established patterns of behavior that may have been appropriate during their offspring's childhood, but no longer serve the best interests of either parent or child as they relate to each other as adults. As I completed reading this book I made a visit home and found that my own mother was reading this book too. It seems that age had little to do with the applicability of this information. Helpful for anyone working on continuing the process of self-growth and keeping their relationships alive and vital. . . Gary L. Flegal, Ph.D., Professional Stress Management Services."
4,YellowJackets Run For Your Life,"I really like the YellowJackets, and I guess I missed this one when this originally came out. Another fine piece of music from such talented gentlemen. Plenty of different changes from one piece to the next. I real surprise if you haven't heard this one. If you are a YellowJackets Fan, and you don't have this. Get it."
3,Run from Your Stereo,"A fusion of acoustic and electric jazz. Tedious at times and very melodic at others. Very good to excellent sonics. Which ever musician is humming should have been muzzled. His oral histrionics add nothing and are patently distracting. Too much noodling and not enough structure, but over all this recording can be enjoyable. For die hard YJ fans and fans of Bob Mintzer."
3,the series is improving,"Well, after the third book i can rate the book one higher. Maybe it was John Miller or maybe I'm just getting into the character, or maybe i've invested so much time i'm curious as to how the story will end. I think the reason I like this book better was the samurai world. Leigh never makes the mutata or the gairk understandable to the reader, at least with the samuria, we alreardy have an idea what they are like. I hope the last three books in the series Leigh spends time making the mutata understandable."
3,Serves the purpose,For $10 it is a good toy for a little kid who wants to do what Dora does. The only thing they could change in the design is for it to lock into the open position so it doesn't collapse into the less coordinated five year old hands.
1,Poor quality,"The quality of this product is terrible. Bought for my 3yr old seeking Diego adventures and you can not see anything out of the lense! Would not recommend, especially when shipping is half the cost of the product, its not worth it."
3,Nothing great and low quality,"Lasted a few months. Kids did not play with it that much. Maybe a boy would play with it more (i.e. pirate, etc)."
1,a fake telescope,"it is just impossible to see anything... We have been trying for hours, we just cannot see anything from any distance. I just put it is the trash 4 hours after receiving it. DON'T buy it. Waste of your money."
2,"Segundo disco de los Jaivas, una edición deplorable","Los Jaivas, ex High Bass, hicieron una autoproduccción llamada Los Jaivas(alias ""El Volantín"", 1970), de 500 copias, luego vino este disco que también se llamaba Los Jaivas (alias ""La Ventana"", 1973, sello IRT), con su habitual música improvisada y canciones que hacen historia. Pero después de 1973, tras el golpe militar las matrices del disco fueron destruidas, junto a otros trabajos de muchos grupos. Las copias que se hicieron después no eran de buena calidad, algunos temas de este disco vienen sacadas de copias de discos en vinilo, sin remasterizar, así no más. Al final no es buena copia del original. Los temas no corresponden al orden del disco original, hay temas de singles, y no se han hecho más copias que revisen los temas ni el orden original. En Chile se editó hace poco una versión remasterizada, pero aún así, pudo ser mejor."
1,Can we believe the man wearing blinders?,"I bought this book because I wanted to know more about the New York construction industry. There is a lot of information included with the general polemic, but do I trust that it's accurate? i'd have to know more to really be able to tell. But I'm entirely unwilling to take the word of someone who can say with a straight face:""(and, as ex communists, they frankly should have known that bosses and workers NEVER have ANY common interests)..."" [emphasis in original] p. 50.""All of the social ills in our country (and indeed in every country in the world) exist because of the capitalist system--because the whole productive resources of the society are used to profit a small parasitic portion of the population,..."" p. 59.""That's why the government has abolished welfare...."" p. 68.I'm sure there are more, but after being told that the government has abolished welfare, I stopped reading."
4,A CHICK FLICK THAT WON'T MAKE MOST GUYS BARF,"Until I was forced to watch this film on my mother's birthday, my favorite movie that included Jack Black in the cast was THE JACKAL ( I particularly liked watching Bruce Willis blowing pieces of him away... ). That changed when I reluctantly found myself drawn into this very likeable, well-acted romantic-comedy. Cameron Diaz was also enjoyable ( another unexpected plus, as the only other film I liked her in was BEING JOHN MALKOVICH ). It is hard to go wrong with Kate Winslet, or Jude Law, but Eli Wallach almost stole the show. This is a real charmer."
4,Holiday: the movie,"I anticipated seeing Kate Winslet in a romantic comedy, and was not disappointed. For an enjoyable, carefree hour or so, it met the requirements, and gave me a greater appreciation of Jude Law as a well-rounded single father, and introduced me to the charm of Jack Black. Cameron Diaz's character was predictable, but Eli Wallich was a surprising charmer. Some may consider it a little light in story line, but I appreciated the joy of just enjoying the various actors as they excelled in their roles."
3,Diaz drags this one down,"Kate Winslet portrays Iris, a shy writer who has been carrying on a one-sided romance with a colleague. Heartbroken when he gets engaged, she decides she needs a change of scenery and trades homes for the holiday with Hollywood power player Amanda (Cameron Diaz), who also is nursing a broken heart. While Amanda finds romance with Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law) in the English countryside, Iris falls for music composer Miles (Jack Black) in LA, while befriending Arthur (Eli Wallach), a lonely neighbor with ties to the golden age of Hollywood. But can either romance outlast the holiday?Winslet as always is enchanting, and overshadows Diaz, proving what a superior actress she is. Her performance is flawless and real, while Diaz overacts and over gestures her way through the entire script. Black makes an unlikely but believable romantic counterpart. Overall, it's an enjoyable romantic comedy with a pretty good ensemble cast."
4,A Romantic Comedy without the normal clichés,"The idea of house-swapping is a great set-up for comical action. Add to that, beautiful scenery and endearing characters and you've got a fun and touching movie.It's very well made - and the icing on the cake is the attempt made to steer clear of stereotypical plot lines. I was kept guessing as to what would happen next, which is refreshing and unusual for a film of this type.Jack Black, as usual, is great, showing his usual comical charm.Only criticism I have was there appeared to be a bias towards Cameron Diaz and Jude Law. More of the movie seemed to follow their adventures (due to their star appeal no doubt). I wondered, several times, what's Jack and Kate up to?I would definitely recommend this film - not only is it funny and moving as you expect a good romantic comedy to be, but it has fresh and unexpected plot twists that keep you interested as well as satisfied."
4,Love story.,"The story is predictable and a bit trite, but still so much fun to watch. This is a holiday favorite for me."
4,Great Holiday Movie,"My wife and I really enjoy this movie during the holidays. Winslet, Black, and Law are great! Diaz is annoying and overacts like she always does but she's not a deal-breaker for this entertaining movie. We also love the relationship between Iris (Winslet) and Arthur (Wallach)--believable, funny, and endearing all at the same time."
4,Great for Its Genre,"Had a great time watching this. Yes, predictable. But terrific actors -- Cameron Diaz and Jude Law have never done much for me, and they were both wonderful in this. Great settings, too. A bon bon."
4,THE HOLIDAY,I ENJOYED THE MOVIE AND THE FACT THAT IT SHOWED HOW PEOPLE CAN LEARN TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN THE WORST OF TIMES.
4,A new Christmas Classic,Great addition to a video library for those who relish the somewhat cheesy genre of Christmas movies - beautiful scenery and settings in addition to big star acting makes for an easy and enjoyable film you could watch during the holidays again and again over the years.
5,Holiday,Just a good heartwarming love story. I like Jack Black in a more serious role. It made me laugh and want to swap houses with someone for my own holiday :)
5,This is a great holiday chick flick!,"This is such a cute flick. I love all of the stars in it, and the plot is cute and charming. Great pick!"
5,Great Movie!,"I am not a fan of Cameron Diaz, but I love Jack Black, Kate Winslet, and Jude Law, so I figured it'd be worth it to see.I was smiling nearly the entire movie! This has become one of my favorite movies. I loved, loved, loved the story line about the older gentleman and Kate's character and the twist the movie took with Jude Law and Cameron Diaz.This movie was a warm, well-crafted, funny, touching, and completely unexpected joy. This is not your everyday romance movie! Hey, I even liked Cameron by the end of it which is a miracle! I highly recommend this movie to anyone who's tired of the same-old movie from Hollywood.Bravo!"
5,My new favorite Christmas movie,i have really enjoyed this movie. It will become one of my new favorite Christmas classics.
5,Truly a favorite,The movie is so delightful. It has now become one of my favorite romatic comedys that I watch over and over again. I was also satisfied with the cost and how the movie arrived (in excellent condition and timely).
2,"Lukewarm Romantic ""Comedy""","""The Holiday"" saddles its all-star cast with a cliched plot straight out of Hollywood 101. There are good romantic comedies (""Love Actually,"" ""Four Weddings and a Funeral""), and then there's ""The Holiday,"" a heavy fruitcake of a film."
5,The Holiday,"My Oppinion: The Holiday is a very funny movie, i loved all the characters and the actors were great.About the film: The Holiday is about two women irs(Winslet) & Amanda(Diaz) who are fed up with thier love life. They switch homes for the holiday on a home swapping web site. Iris lives in london and Amanda lives in la. The two swap homes for the Holiday and end up meeting the guys of thier dreams which one Grham(Law) is iris's brother and Miles(Black) is Amanda's ex-boyfriends best friend. which takes a comical turn on how the girls keep the guys.My second Oppinion: The Holiday is a great Romantic comedy for everyone. Nancy Meyers does an outstanding job on this movie.If you liked this movie then check out The Holiday original Motion Picture Soundtrack."
3,Kate Winslet and Jack Black rock,"Between the pairs Kate Winslet - Jack Black in L.A. and Cameron Diaz - Jude Law in U.K., I must say the L.A. pair was the more interesting to watch. Kate Winslet showed heart (kind to the elderly neighbour), taste and intelligence with a longing for true love. Jack Black showed sense. And the big, spacious and ambient L.A. mansion surely helps a lot.Cameron Diaz - Jude Law 's storyline in Surrey, on the other hand, appears to be shallow and unconvincing. The chemistry between Cameron and Jude seem to be non-existing. When they first met in the Surrey cottage, the way they giggled, conversed and the things they said were teenage stuff and predictable. No way could this be an indispensable and successful Hollywood trailer maker with a sharp sense. However, there were shots of the picturesque Surrey cottage that were simply postcard perfect. The movie could do a lot better if the story in Surrey is given more substance and heart."
3,Another movie that is WAY to long,"This could have been a good movie, but at 130 min(!!), it was downrightdull in several spots, especially a lot of plodding, cutesy conversationbetween Law and Diaz (neither one can i stand much, and rather smellas actors anyways). Take out a half hour of that schlock, and the moviecould have worked, especially with the funky duo of Winslet and Black (now those are entertainers!). Actually, the WHOLE MOVIE should have just been about those two, duh! Why can't i be a producer, ""with a hit show on broadway, la la la"". (-:"
2,"Oh, Please...","I like romantic comedies, I do. I enjoyed Nancy Meyers's Something's Got to Give and What Women Want. But there's got to be something in these movies besides beautiful people (in this case, two good-looking people, one somewhat attractive woman and a very ugly man).I saw The Holiday expecting, well, some holiday fun and left utterly disappointed. The plot was predictable, the only interesting character was played by Jude Law (Diaz's character was simply unbelievable, Winslet's was pathetic, and don't even get me started on Jack Black...) and there wasn't anything remotely cute or funny about the movie.As far as I'm concerned, The Holiday is a waste of talent and time."
2,Just an awful movie.,"I don't want to say too much about this film except that it was painful to watch and seemed to hold its characters, especially the females, in contempt. I am a guy who likes a good chick flick, but this wasn't one of them. Read the other negative reviews for more details, and by all means watch something else."
2,A boring romantic-comedy that's not funny,"Cameron Diaz is her usual adorable self, Kate Winslet is a bore, Jack Black is a disaster, and Jude Law is the best actor of the bunch in this film.Even Cameron Diaz's looks can't save this one, it's a boring tale of three people having relationship problems that come to a head around the holidays. Diaz and Winslet's characters house swap to get away from their romantic woes, and you can predict the outcome early on.Winslet's character gets involved with an old Hollywood screenwriter and his old fogey friends, which slows the film down and bored me to death.If you watch television, you have seen the the only two scenes which are mildly funny from the trailers hawking the film. The one thing I really detest about viewing movies being billed as comedies is anticipating funny scenes that never materialize, which is what 'The Holiday' constantly achieves, it makes you feel let down and disappointed too many times."
1,Bad Service,"Ordered DVD on 10/30/09 and sent an e-mail to the company, and received tracking information and couldn't even talk to a real person. Tracking showed it being delivered to the USPS. I see that the seller on the most part has good reviews, but in my case nothing was done to solve the problem."
5,Cute movie,"A nice movie to chill out of our daily hectic life. Sit back, relax, snuggle up and enjoy!"
1,DVD,The DVD is crap. It freezes and skips and was absolutely miserable to to TRY and watch. I just hope I can find the packaging so that I can return it. With my luck I have thrown it out.
5,The Holiday,This is a great movie. I seen it when it first came out and loved it so much I preordered it.
1,Blows,I'd rather watch a Lifetime movie staring Tina Yothers. 2 hours that I'll never get back! Save yourself and watch something else.
1,Truly awful.,"I must say I've enjoyed the work of all 4 main actors (Winslet, Diaz, Law, and Black) in other films, but they are all sadly wasted in this one. And casting Jack Black opposite Kate Winslet? Totally unbelievable. The only semi-believable character is Rufus Sewell as Winslet's cad of an ex-boyfriend. The basic plot sounded like fun and had real potential, but much of the dialogue sounded like something a high school student might have written. And I'm not trying to insult high school students who aspire to be writers, but most of the dialogue is truly immature. The only reason I'm giving it even one star is because Jude Law is so good to look at."
3,Ok film,"When I saw that Nancy Meyer did Somethings Got to Give, I realized why this film didn't really turn me on. It had its charming moments but all in all, I found it boring at times(like the previously mentioned Something... movie) and implausible at other times. It was cute but definitely not memorable."
4,The Holiday,This movie was very well edited. I think that this was one of Cameron Diaz's best performances and she and Jude Law work very well together. Unfortunately there is no real chemistry between Kate Winslet and Jack Black.
4,as good in july as in december,"i absolutely fell in love with this bit of cinema fluff. over new years, my son and his girl friend were here. she and i wanted to watch it. he pronounced, after watching for 30 minutes, that he thought he was deveoping ovaries. and that came from an M.D."
5,love it,loved the two stories intertwiningloved the two totally different settings also.Its as good as youve got mail too
5,Wonderful Romantic Comedy,"The Holiday is a wonderful heart-warming romantic comedy and is right up there with"" Love Actually"". It's a 'feel good' movie. The stars are wonderful and Jack Black is terrific."
5,Holiday,I feel the movie Holiday is a beautiful story and one that truly gives anyone a feeling of happiness. I purchased several as gifts this past Christmas. It was the DVD that my 20 year old Grandaughter had at the top of her Christmas List.
2,Poor shape,"One of the the dvd covers was in poor shape inside and out. It didn't even hold the dvd in place, it was ripped no the front and it wasn't even taped securely shut. The overall shipping package was not glued or taped shut and it appeared someone had actually opened the package to check out the contents somewhere during the shipping process. One of the dvds seems to play pretty well but appears to have scratches."
3,The Holiday,This is a really good movie one of my Female friends and i watched this movie so i decided to get this Dvd it is a good romantic movie. i would reccomend this movie to any one who enjoys romantic movies
4,The Holiday~~~Review of movie,"This is a lovely, insightful movie~~~Full of all good things~~~Watch as you have time~~~and have a box of Kleenex at the ready~~~"
4,Great for the broken heart!,"I rented this movie and watched it twice before deciding to buy. The characters in the movie can be easily related to--situation wise, that is. Any woman who's been hurt can relate to the feelings of Kate Winslet's character, and those who feel emotionally closed off will identify with Diaz's character. Jack Black is loveable and surprisingly attractive in the film, and Jude Law's performance will leave you shouting ""men like you don't exist!"" at the screen...all the while bringing tears to your eyes and a smile to your face at the same time."
4,A Really Enjoyable Romantic Comedy,"I know this isn't a great movie but it's really enjoyable and heartwarming. Cameron Diaz is a workaholic who finds out her boyfriend is cheating on her. She trades houses over the holidays with Kate Winslet, who's devastated when the love of her life announces his engagement. Both women learn a lot about themselves in their new surroundings and fall in love. Jack Black and Jude Law are terrific as the new love interests. A really charming movie that I'd watch all over again."
5,"Amazing, Emotional, SO ROMANTIC and SO TRUE !","I bought it 2 days ago, and since...I watched it 4 times in a row. LOVE IT. What a masterpiece ! And it worthes any penny ! Love it , love it, love it !!!Nancy Meyers: BRAVO !"
2,Not good for Jack Black,"I am actually a fan of Jack Black and I think that a movie could be written where he's a romantic lead. But this wasn't it. He looked unconfortable and his acting was awkward.The story was uneven. It was mostly with the american chick in England and the part with the English chick in the USA was mostly an afterthought.The download wasn't very sharp. For some reasons Amazon makes some very good downloads but sometimes they are just not very sharp... This was not a very sharp movie (I mean literarily.. it was a bit blurry)The part with the English guy crying was very weird. I would say gay, but I think gays are more macho than this guy.... I mean really. Guys do cry but not this blathering... sheesh...Not awful but not very good either"
1,Unbelievable!,"Unbelievably bad. So, I'll admit, the Rom-Com genre really isnt my thing, but hey, my wife gets half the Netflix, so we settled down to watch, and unfortunately waste our time on, this movie. I can't get that hour and a half back folks, and I'm pretty mad about it.Its as if the creators of the Not Another Teen Movie/Scary Movie films got together and decided to make Not Another Romantic Comedy. Every single bad romantic comedy cliche is in there:You've got the solo-singing. You've got the angry, throwing-objects mood swings. You've got the too-good-to-be-true swinging single-dad bachelor. The cheating boyfriend. The ""crazy"" supportive friends. I've seen this movie before, just not all at once, as it is truly a formulamatic representation of all that is bad in this type of movie....and we are supposed to suspend reality and believe Jack Black is a mild, tame, abused romantic? Who are you, and what have you done with the insane half of Tenacious D?Avoid like the plague."
5,The Holiday,"My wife and I had this movie previously but it was stolen last Christmas along with four others, it was a must have so we purchased it again. I keep it with our Christmas movies, it is a fave."
5,I love this movie,I just love this movie! I would recomend it to all my friends and by the way I already have!
4,I NEVER received this item!!!,I ordered The Holiday weeks ago and it never arrived in time for Christmas. What do I do????
5,Comedically Romantic,"This movie was funny, romantic, and just enjoyful. A movie for everyone, even your man."
5,Great film,Such a great film. Kate Winslet gives a great performance as always. One of Cameron Diaz' best movies in my opinion.A great romantic dramedy.
5,One of my favorites,"My sister & I watch this, together, every holiday season. It's a great chick flick. We love it! 5 stars!"
3,A little heavy for a holiday movie,"looking for a funny light holiday movie, it was OK, but as title said, was a little heavy. still a good watch though"
5,Love this movie...,Always watch this around the holidays but it is great any time of the year! Highly recommended to anyone !
3,Solid Holiday No-Brainer Feelgood Movie,This is a solid pick at the holidays for a feelgood romance flick. It is totally predictable and not much substance - just a good no-brainer for date night.
4,One of my Top 10 Feel Good Films,"We expect the love stories that take place to work out in the end and in that vain there is nothing new. It wasn't particularly well written and we're used to seeing Cameron Diaz in these types of roles that she's plays (in fact, she's played this same character in more than half of the films she's starred in), but there's something about this movie that completely envelops you. There's also something about Kate Winslet playing a completely love sick, mopey woman. She often plays strong characters, not wimps, and there was something about her performance that didn't make her seem that way, but actually made your heart go out to her. You could even relate to the privileged character that is played by Cameron Diaz. This is one of those movies I watch during the winter, put a blanket around me, and eat a bowl of frozen yogurt. It's such a chick flick, total guilty pleasure, and a true classic as far as my favorite go-to movies are concerned."
4,Cute Movie,This movie is really cute. A typical romantic comedy with an obvious ending but the plot is uplifting. It's hard to watch Jack Black act next to Kate Winslet because she's actually ACTING. Worth the money!
5,Loved it!,"Just a happy, feel good movie. I loved it! Nancy Meyers does such a great job with movies she makes."
3,Can't Stand Cameron Diaz,"I enjoyed the movie for the most part. Cameron Diaz annoyed me. She's not a great actress in my opinion. I couldn't take her seriously as one falling for Jude Law's character. On the hand, Jude Law, Jack Black, and Kate Winslet were great. They made the movie for sure. Jude Law mesmorized me - so romantic! (Yes, i'm a fan of his if you can't tell.)"
4,The Holiday,"Although I'm not much on romantic comedies, I did like this one. Pedictable through out, the stars acting made me overlook this fact, and Eli Wallach was just a joy to watch."
4,worth seeing,The Holiday is predictable...but fun and fulfilling. We've seen it a few times and it hits all the plot points at the right time.Worth seeing.
5,A new classic,"This movie is like comfort food. The performances are warm and heartfelt, and I really enjoy the interplay between the characters."
3,Cute but not too memorable,"I think my favorite part of this movie is the way Cameron Diaz looks. Her wardrobe and her quirky ways work so well together. Eye candy! Of course, I love Jude, so it was a no brainer devoting 100 minutes of my time to this chick flick. The plot is relatively simple and predictable, but still heart warming. I bought it for my 20 year old daughter who loves movies like this."
5,A delightful story that is for early teens to the elderly!,"Can't imagine Christmas without this movie! It is very modern yet old in the theme of love. Love is out there in the places in which you are not particularly in search of that special someone. All the actors bring truth to their characters with their past, hurt, hope and desire to find a life more fulfilling in their future."
1,Stank,"Now, as a dutiful boyfriend, I've had to sit through my share of reeking romantic comedies, and some I've found more than merely tolerable. The plot is going to stink, that's a given - but maybe there'll be a laugh here or there, like in ""Something about Mary."" Not this time. By the standards of the genre, this one is boring. Even my girlfriend, who drags me to these things without shame, suggested halfway through that we nuke this one and put on something else. So, fair warning: this one is as corny as a regular romantic comedy, but without any entertainment value. Dull as it gets. Cameron Diaz was atrocious, worst actress in the world, capable of only one character (and it's not cute any more.)By the way, was I supposed to laugh when she punches her boyfriend in the face twice? Why is domestic violence funny when the woman is the attacker? This actually happens in reality, by the way. Imagine a guy beating his girl being played off as slapstick. There'd be an uproar."
5,Great Movie,This movie is great watch it because it is full of love. You will want to watch it over and over again.
3,Holiday Review,"An interesting, but extraordinarily long piece that can only be described as a ""chick-flick."" Although its more like two ""chick-flicks"" rolled into one title. The one with Jude Law and Cameron Diaz is a well developed exploration of the difficulty of making commitment, while the other half of this film, Jack Black and Kate Winslet feels about as dry and scripted as any performance I've seen yet. Not a bad movie, but it sure is Looong!"
5,My new favorite movie,"This movie is great, you get to see a top actress like Cameron Diaz act like one of us normal women; getting drunk and rockin' out to the radio. A definate must buy."
3,Can't watch on Android tablet,"This movie is great but I was hoping to watch it on my android tablet but there is no app and I got an error message stating that I needed a different flash player to watch it through my browser even though I have most up to date versio, and I can't download it on my pc and transfer it over because it is protected. Plus, once I discovered all of this I couldn't find a way to return it. I will probably just delete it."
3,CHICK FLICK ALERT,This is pretty simple...I thought the movie was O.K. ...but my wife really liked it...so I bought it...not much more to be said...a real chick flick...
4,"Cute, definitely click-flicky","This is a chick flick. Make no mistake about it. If you are a man's man who only watches football and things that blow up, run away screaming. Now. Okay then. This a cute little film where two ladies switch houses to get away from it all over the holidays. Of course, they fall in love, then there's drama and... hey, it's a chick flick.The acting was very good (Kate Winslet is amazing), the filming was quite good as well. The twists and turns are a bit predictable, if I'm being honest, but again - it's a chick flick.It's worth a watch ladies, when you have a night alone and want to curl up with a silly movie, a bowl of popcorn and your favorite soda."
4,a great romantic comedy,"Just rented this movie and really enjoyed it. It's a fun little romantic comedy that will certainly get you in the holiday spirit. Jack Black is funny, as always. He also shows a more sensitive side, that you don't always see in his movies. That was a highlight for me.The story, in general, is one we can all relate to. Most of us are working way too hard and bypassing the little things that make life so great. That was my big takeaway from this. It was a nice (and sometimes hilarious) reminder to stop and smell the roses."
5,Great Movie!,"I have moved this movie to the top of my all-time favorites list. Kate Winslett was superb, but so were all the principal characters. The chemistry between Eli Wallach and Kate was fantastic. Any time I'm feeling down this movie makes me happy and when I'm not down I still love it! Yes, it's a chick flick, but in my opinion Nancy Meyers is a great writer/director, who allowed Jack Black to improvise with excellent results. My significant other has watched it with me at least 5 times, so it's a chick flick that guys enjoy too!"
5,Feel good,This is a great feel good holiday movie. Nothing too heavy. Good soundtrack too. Makes you feel good after watching it.
2,All in moderation...,"I admit, I got ganked into watching this film. I've got nothing for Diaz. Nothing personal, I just find her to be a one-trick pony and don't run out to see her films. I am however keenly fond of Winslet and Law... and yes, Black. So with 3:1 odds I was rather easily wrangled into this cute little romantic comedy. The plot is not particularly intense: two women on the international skids of love swap houses for two weeks, each embarking on new personal revelations and... new love. I enjoyed the comedic flare of Winslet, as she's known more to be a dramatic actress. Many people balked at the idea of her starring opposite Black, but the two actually worked quite well together. While Law was convincing in his role, and Diaz was equally so in seemingly playing herself, the two had no chemistry. Again, it's a romantic comedy. As long as you're not looking for engaging dialogue and witty drama, this film rocks ;)"
4,A Great Film for Women - I bought it.,"Most of the negative reviews on this movie are probably written by men. Since everyone has an opinion and different perspective, however, I have to say I LOVED this film. I had just gone through a nasty split with a boyfriend of six years and went to see this film hoping to be cheered up. Not only did it cheer me up, I saw elements in this film that were beyond comedy, beyond simple romance. I saw an old man who finally was honored for his greatness, two women who deserved better than they were getting and got it and two men who knew how to treat women. It was beautiful, emotional, soul touching and of course, funny.The guys who see this could learn something. But most of them probably won't. Yes, it was lengthy, but worth every minute of it. There was no blood and guts, no killing and no illegal ploys at work. It was simply life as it can be when the right people find each other."
4,Better Than You Think It Will Be,"Great cast does a smart job with this script. Lots of fun. I'm sure it will be classified as a ""chick flick"" but everyone can enjoy this and will. It's really a good movie."
5,Wonderful Christmas movie!,This move is full of all kinds of emotions and issues but still makes you feel good. Well worth watching!
3,"ok, worth seeing","has its moments. Acting not bad, if you in the mood for a christmas movie would recommend for a laugh"
4,Cute Movie,"This is a light-hearted romantic movie that is fun to watch. Jude Law and Cameron Duaz have a nice on-screen chemistry. She is gorgeous as ever and although I typically don't care for his movies, I very much liked him in this one. Kate Winslet is fabulous, as usual. Jack Black plays his part well. The script has some weak moments, but overall it's a cute film. Definitely not for kids, even with the PG-13 rating. Worth watching just to see Eli Wallach and the cameo by Dustin Hoffman."
1,Awful,"No romantic comedy has any reason being 2.5 hours long. It was pure torture. There was so much stuff that could have been left out--esp. the entire subplot with Eli Wallach. When a girl wants to watch a chick flick, she doesn't think ""Oh, I hope she finds a fulfilling friendship with the old man next door!"" So many plot holes you could drive a truck through them. I like a good romance, but this wasn't it. If you like Jane Austin and the Brontes, STAY AWAY."
4,"A pleasurable ""Holiday""",A beautiful transfer of a delightful film to Blu-ray and DVD. This film brings a breath of fresh air to the movies after the intensity of the several Oscar nominated movies this year. The cast is absolutely perfect and beleivable in this romantic comedy which intentionally or not contrasts life situations of two couples during the Holiday season in London and California. I think everyone will mark this movie as one of their new holiday favorites. I did!
1,I saw the BOOM microphone about 50 times!!!!,"The list of characters for THE HOLIDAY needs to include the boom mic! Sometimes it appears as a round hanging shadow lurking above the other characters, but other times you can actually see the wires and pole thrusting it into the scene. It had perfect timing to intrude on the last great moment of the film when Jude Law cries for his woman. Hopefully the mic will receive some critical acclaim and win some awards. A+ for Mr. Boom Mic.The whole film crew should go back to film school! Obviously they thought the story would hide the technical faults. Wrong!"
1,Deck the Halls....,"My cousin Damian is married to Alex; her father is the man responsible for the Christmas lights in this movie. They are AWESOME! From the delicate little buds around the fireplace to the stunningly lit garlands that cover the staircase, they are so pretty and perfect. And the strategically placed candles add such warmth and charm. The Christmas tree is beyond beautiful. The outside of the house is a treat; gorgeous arrays of colour that perfectly suits an English cottage. They truly showcase what a British Christmas should be like. Oh yes the movie itself - BEYOND PUTRID and possibly the WORST MOVIE EVER MADE.EVER."
1,laaaammmeee,Couldn't give it zero star. I just wanted to say that there are sexier and more romantic men in Hollywood that could've played Jack Black's role. We are talking Kate Winslet here she deserves better than this
1,How Disappointing !,"I was extremely disappointed in this item. Had looked forward to viewing the movie but, after inserting it in DVD player, it refused to play. I even had someone else try it on their DVD player. It would have taken me the expense and inconvenience to return it so I just called it a loss !! I sent feedback - never got a response. Will not order from this seller again."
3,COuld have been,better. I couldn't wait to rent this one and now I think I could wait a little longer. It is really long especially for the ending to still have such loose ends. I wish it would have been better and made a little more sense.
4,Wonderful movie,If you love romantic comedies then you will love the Holiday. Cameron Diaz is awesome in this movie and the supporting cast are wonderful. They all help make this movie a great film.Nancy Meyers writer and director of Something gotta give .
5,Such a sweet movie!,"This movie is so good and it looks great on blu-ray! Seriously a chick flick! Cameron Diaz is one of my favorite actresses and she really cracked me up in this movie. I am not usually a big fan of Jude Law, but he was sooooooooo sweet in this movie. A feel good movie!"
3,"pretty, cute & simple","This is a good choice if you don't want to think about what you are watching at all. Beautiful locations, charming and very attractive talent and happy accidents make this easy to watch and enjoy."
2,Cheesy holiday romcom,"Cute storyline but Cameron Diaz is totally miscast as the overly-serious, unemotional career type. The rest of the cast does really well."
5,great movie,"I absolutely love this movie. It's just an amazing, feel good Christmas movie. I think Kate Winslet is one of the most beautiful and talented actresses out today."
5,MOVIE,I LOVE THIS MOVIE. JACK BLACK IS GREAT INSTEAD OF NUTTY AND ELI WALLACH PLAYS SUCH A CUTE CRUSTY OLD GENT. LOVE THE ENDING!
1,should have listen to the 26 one star reviews instead of the 197 five star reviews,"I sometimes enjoy watching silly romantic comedies but it was not the case with this movie, it was actually bad and embarrassing to watch. Great cast, awful writing"
1,A little balance...,"I don't usually do reviews, but I couldn't let this sit with an average 4-star rating. Especially since that 4-star rating - along with the cast - enticed me to watch it, thereby wasting 2 1/4 hours of my life. Even what works best in this movie is completely formulaic and predictable. What doesn't work - most glaringly - is the non sequitur sub-plot featuring an utterly unnecessary character who was made central for reasons only the creators could possibly fathom (perhaps to humor a producer?). Largely because of this sub-plot - but also for an apparent phobia of editing in general, revealed in such worthless gems as Cameron Diaz's unfunny staring contest with a dog - the film is at least 45 minutes too long. Though listed under comedies, the laughs are few, far between, and generally weak. Best skip it."
1,awful!,"Usually I like movies like this, and usually I like Jack Black...but it just wasn't working for me! The plot is thin, the acting is poor, and you can actually feel the minutes (that you'll never get back!) sl!ipping away sllllooowwwwlllyyyy. If you want a feel-good holiday movie, Love Actually is 10,000 times better"
1,"No, No, No...","Its not okay for women to hit men anymore than for men to hit women. I saw the preview of this piece of nonsense and the moment Cameron Diaz hit the guy, I said absolutely no way will I buy this. If a man had ever hit a woman for cheating on him, we'd never hear the end of it. No sale."
2,"Great Movie, Unfortunately the DVD was scratched","I purchased this for my mom for Christmas. The DVD was not in perfect quality. However, the movie itself is a lovely film that we all enjoyed!"
5,Best chick flick I've seen in a while,"The movie was cute, touching, and full of surprises. I absolutely loved it and will be buying the DVD the minute it comes out!"
2,"Lame, Second Rate Movie","This movie was a big dud. Trying to pair Jack Black up with any reasonably decent looking women (including Winslet) just isn't believable. Trying to portray Jack Black as a serious guy...just doesn't work. All Cameron Diaz can do is smile her big giant, goofy grin. She has no substance to her acting and her characters are usually fairly dull and/or ditzy.This was a waste of time."
5,Another great one for the Christmas collection!!,"I am an avid collector of movies for my Christmas collection. My wife got me started on this movie, and I have to say it was a VERY nice surprise. When it came out, I thought it was just a 'Chick Flick'. It is a romance, but everybody can enjoy this one.As for the collection, I always ask myself if a Christmas movie is one that I should add, will I watch it every year, is the story a good Christmas movie, etc.? 'The Holiday' is definitely one if you like keeping a box of movies that gets pulled out around Thanksgiving every year!Don't let the low price fool you either. It is a great deal for a great movie."
3,On time but not perfect,"I received the DVD in the expected amount of time, but the cover is kind of messed up, like the plastic was melted or something. The DVD obviously works fine, though."
2,Is It Over Yet?,"Wow, I am surprised at all the positive reviews here. My husband and I just watched this last night and we were glad when it finally ended. After some time, my husband checked to see how much longer this would go on and we still had 40 minutes! That's when I got up and started doing something else. I agree with another poster that Cameron Diaz was trying too hard. Despite all the great reviews here, it's not for everyone. If you like a boring, never ending sappy chick flick, this is for you."
4,sweet a romantic - just as you would expect!,"Finally an intelligent romantic comedy that's lovely and charming with a great cast. Be on the lookout from a funny cameo from Dustin Hoffman, who just happened to be at the Blockbuster while the film crew was filming their scenes!"
4,Fun Chick-Flick!,This is one of those movies that I love to watch with my husband. I never thought of Jack Black as a romantic lead but he is sweet and funny!
5,Great movie!,"It's kind of a chick flick, but an original story. I really enjoyed this movie and have watched it several times."
5,Estrogen Flick,"If you live with a female, then you need to get this DVD..it is a keeperin their eyes and it goes well with beer and chips."
4,Great movie!,"This movie is about two women who are having relationship problems. Amanda (Cameron Diaz) is a woman living with a man in LA. She has just found out that he is cheating on her and kicked him out. Iris (Kate Winslet) is in love with her ex, who is getting married to someone else. Their paths intertwine when they decide to swap houses for the Christmas holiday. The unexpected romance that they find when they arrive at each other's house brings laughter and tears. This is a great movie for all of those people out there who love sappy movies."
5,Top favorites,"This is always one of my favorite movies during the Holidays. A complete chick flick, disguised as a Christmas movie. Love the characters and the relationships they build. Iris and the old man are so sweet together. Jack Black plays a surprisingly normal and affectionate composer, and Jude Law plays the dysfunctional heart-throb of an older brother. I enjoy Cameron Diaz in this movie, although her character is solidly neurotic. Finding an escape from everyday life during the holidays turned out to be a good plan for both Diaz and Winslet."
5,The Holiday,We love this movie. We watch it a couple times a year. We bought the cd's and gave all but one away torelatives for Christmas.Bill and Linda
2,Less expensive models that do a better job,"This did not live up to the boasting of prior reviews. It arrived damaged, cosmetically, but when tested with household odors did not work as expected."
3,Fan gets noisy over time,"And if you use it nightly, it might go past the warranty and then you're stuck with shipping charges. God forbid it makes noise beyond the warranty. Which is a shame since it does work really well. Cleans the room out of allergens in a short time period.If you're a gambler, do try it."
3,"Not bad, not great",I like the reasonably priced filter replacements and I like the number of layers of different filtration. However this unit does not blow very strong and similarly rated units that I have move much more air. This is a good unit but don't be afraid to look elsewhere.
4,Pet Allergies,"My boyfriend and I purchased this air purifier because it was the only one within our price range that also covered the amount of space we needed. My boyfriend is allergic to cats, but we decided to adopt one anyway. With a combination of claritin, this air purifier, visine, and a small plant (to offset the ionizer), he's had very mild reactions to our sweet new kitty.Pros:-On/off switch for ionizer, which can release ozone (toxic). We bought a small plant to offset the ionizer, but we rarely turn it on.-3 speed settngs.-Good for open apartments or large rooms. Our open area is nearly 500sq.ft.-HEPA filter, great to pick up allergens like pet dander.Cons:- highest setting gets a little loud sometimes.- releases cool air. If we purchased this in the summer, I'd probably list it as a pro."
2,I am not very satisfied with the unit,"This unit says up to 500 sq foot for clean air usage, I currently am using it in my office that is approx 200 sq ft and I am not a heavy smoker and it just doesn't quite do the job, I guess when I close the door, leave it running on high and come back into the room about an hour later (after having one or two cigarettes) the room smells clean but that is about the level of performance you should expect out of this unit. I would not recommend it."
2,The one I got wasn't 'Soft & Sweet',"Another reviewer said that this was a soft doll with no hard parts. I ordered it thinking it would be perfect for my niece. What I got was a hard plastic doll with small pieces labeled ""Not for Children Under Three."" Needless to say, I was very disappointed. This would be great for a 4 or 5 year old, but don't expect a soft, cuddly doll for your little one."
4,cute doll,My daughter is 3 and just started liking the Disney Princess'. I thought this doll would be to young for her but she loves it and sleeps with it every night.This doll doesn't have small parts but does have a hard face.I would definately recommend this cute baby doll.
3,Cute doll.,"My daughter definitely loved it, the only problem is that if I wanted to wash this or clean it up... well, can't really do that. Poor doll couldn't keep up, really adorable though."
5,A wonderful and thoroughly enjoyable book!,"In Suddenly Married, Dara Mackenzie is a math teacher who loses her job because of a scandal involving her father, who has since died. While searching for another job, Dara takes over teaching a first-grade Sunday School class. She immediately falls in love with two solemn children, who happen to be the children of Noah Lucas, the lawyer who is investigating her father's case. Initial antagonism between the two soon turns to friendship, then love. This book was the first of the Love Inspired books which I bought--and after reading it, I was hooked on the series. However, I have read and re-read Suddenly Married and it remains one of my favorites. I love Loree Lough's writing style and the characters who come alive each time I open the book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to read Inspirational romance."
4,The time trap,The Time TrapI read about a book called The Time Trap. It was a very good book. It was about a time traveler named Jeff. He was traveling back in time to planet x-12. When the insects from earth went over to planet x-12 and got very sick. Jeff and his partner the one got sick and had to go back to earth. Jeff had to wait for a new partner. Then Jeff saw this light moving and he new that was his new partner. He's new partner was a girl named Maria. She wasn't beautiful but she was pretty. While they were back in time They had to take some pictures. They saw some strange animals and they had to see what it was like in the past in planet x-12
5,Maya Hieroglyphs a Clasic work,"A few months ago, I took a course about the Mayan Calendars. This book was recommended by Dr. Oswaldo Chinchilla who taught the course. Wanting to learn more about the Maya and their writings was the reason for getting the book. I would venture to say that Morley's explanation of the calendars is very clear and precise. Of great importance is the comparison of how the signs for numbers appear in the codices and how they appear on the inscriptions on altars or stelas. The same is true for the glyphs. The chapters that explain the use of numbers by the Maya are essential for understanding the Maya inscriptions on monuments and in the codices."
4,"It's like THE SIMS, Only with a LOT of whiskey!","This is a substantial program! It is funny and quite creative. The random generator might seem a little strange at first, but that is one of the highest selling points here. You get a surprise with each level! Not to mention the fact that it DOES actually increase in difficulty as you go! The areas you play within become much larger, the enemy (which is pretty much everyone!) gets a lot smarter. This is not a bad game at all. (...)"
1,Not as pictured.,Unless your AC is the exact size of the face its will end up looknig like a sagging diaper. Even wit hthe enclosed plastic insulation installed it doesn't measurable cut down on the cold air coming through.
2,a/c cover,"a bit big but it served its purposed, it was not a tight fit. next time i will take better measurements"
4,worthwhile purchase,"I purchased this product because my sister had a similar one on her AC and was happy with it. I am happy with this purchase overall. The foam included to insulate the AC with seems rather light and thin, but there was enough of it to do two layers on my AC. The quilted cover went on easily. I have a wall unit in my apartment, and like another reviewer, it doesn't stick out 2 inches into the room. So, the cover is a bit saggy, but was able to fit and hold the power cord. I would purchase this product again."
2,Junk,"Save your money. You get a piece of foam and a roll of tape. Tape the foam over the air conditioner, after you cut it to fit),then slip the insulated cover overall. A lot of work and a poor fit from the elastic band sewn into the outer cover. No way to adjust. You'll do better elsewhere."
2,waste of money,"Just got this item. Waste of money. Not worth the $28. I spent.Does not block cold air, I guess I'll have to buy some kind of a plastic insert to block cold air and cover it with the fabric cover.The insert they sent with this item is useless."
3,Bands of Steel!!!,"One person cannot put this on by himself.The elastic bands are way too tight. I'msure that's necessary to get a tight fix,but they could have put some draw stringsor something else to snug it up tight.Additionally, for me, my AC is in the walland two inches don't stick out. Because the'depth' is two inches, it's saggy since itdoesn't slide on all the way.That said, it does keep the cold air out."
3,AirConditioner Cover,"This is really not a perfect ""one fits all -- large conditioners"". I was not impressed with the quality of the material. The foam plastic instide cover tore as soon as I opened the package. If the air conditioner was not installed with enough inside exposer, the cover will not stay on, even with the elastic band. At a cost of $22.00 per unit, I would not recommed it. One can do a better job by installing your own plastic sheeting."
1,"Yes, it's impossible to put on","I fall squarely into the ""it doesn't fit, it can't be put on"" school of reviewers. I ended up having to cut the rubber and tape the cover on to get it to work. Time will tell how well it blocks the cold, but even if it works, I would certainly not buy another of these or recommend it."
1,air conditioner cover,"Puchased this item for my indoor air conditioner after taking the exact measurements. It was ill fitting and kept popping off because the elastic was too tight. Contacted the manufacturer, and they said I could not return it because I had opened the package. They intimated that I had not measured correctly. The item went in the trash."
3,It works....but it ain't pretty....,"I just received this and it does the trick. Very saggy though. I have a through the wall AC and there's just not enough of it sticking out into the room for a proper fit. I did manage to get the elastic band around it though, including the electrical cord. I'm hoping for slightly lower heating bills, enough to at least justify the cost."
3,"Acceptable product, very slow service","I resorted to Amazon for this product because I couldn't find it in the size I needed at my local hardware stores. It took a very long time for the order to ship and arrive.The product worked just as expected and was of acceptable quality. The tape provided could use more adhesion and be a little longer, but I supplemented it with regular duct tape."
2,NEED SOMETHING BETTER,"I agree with the other bad reviews. I have owned several of these over the years--I have 5 through the wall air conditioners--and I cannot put any of the covers on. They are way too tight. I had to cut the elastic on all of them and they tack the cover over the air conditioners and tape them at the bottom. It is still drafty but better than nothing at all. The market lacks a good fitting cover for these air conditioners. Years ago Sears sold a fitted hard Foam cover that could be painted to match your walls. It was draft free, slipped right over the air conditioner inside the house and worked well but is not sold anymore. Someone should offer these again."
1,Do yourself a Favor,"As a professor of Judaic Studies with a keen interest in Ethnography and Israel, I thought this book, which fell into my lap, or rather through my mailbox at my university, would be of interest. I found Susan Kahn is that genre of writer I abhor: arrogant, know-it-all, and so married to erudition that she has no voice. I can't imagine how anyone, with or without my interests in kinship and Israel, would possibly make it all the way through this book. I did so, and much to my dismay. Do yourself a favor and don't go burrow into this tome. It is unrewarding; a sad statement about this ""experts"" utter lack of a humane voice in her work. Whatever her talents, writing well is not among them."
5,Great Record,"This is Steve just after the break up of HumblePie.....old Pie demos and some new 'AmericanStyle' tracks (hence the American side), and, a very nice re-recording of WhamBamThankYouMa'am that Steve did while still with SmallFaces. This is a great record and well worth the price, a must for any SteveMarriott fan!"
3,Steve Marriot Marriot,"I have always been a big Steve Marriot fan. I had this one (or heard it before; I can't remember) a long time ago. It has been some time since this was reissued. I bought it thinking that maybe I could hear some good old post Humble Pie licks. If you like Steve and the work he compiled over the years, you won't be disapointed. Steve actually plays lead on this ablum. The guitar work is a little over bearing at points cause of the way it was recorded, not any deficit on Marriots part. The Blackberrys return for some cuts, and the bands Steve assembled are top notch. The horn work on the American side adds a dimension that I have not heard before. There does seem to be a little stress in Steves' voice at times because of the crap he was going through. I saw him in 1980 in a very small dance hall on 1st Avenue in Seattle. I liked him then and if you feel like I do about this guy then buy it."
2,they're playing our song,"not the best musical produced however , needed cd for song that I am singing namely, ""fallin'""."
1,Satisfied,"My 2 yr.old Grand-Daughter loves Caillou. Amazon once again came through for me, having the D.V.D.'s I'm looking for."
2,Daughter Hates the Puppets,"My daughter loves Caillou, but has been very upset with this video. For some reason the producers decided to interweave narrative vignettes with puppets and live action -- my daughter spends the duration of each segment complaining that she wants Caillou, and I spend lots of time with my fingers on the remote. I wish the producers had identified the DVD content more clearly; we'd have bought something else.Disappointed overall."
3,Cartoon is excellent; kids dancing and puppets are irritating!,"This video contains one or two episodes of Caillou, which is fine, but the musical interludes with kids dancing and lip-synching is horrendous! The songs are awful, and the choreography is lousy.The puppets used to be on the show on PBS, but they aren't anymore. We have another Caillou DVD (The Creative) that is MUCH longer and doesn't have any kids or puppets. I'm not sure how to tell which of the other videos contain them..."
3,Not just Caillou,"My 2 year old loves Caillou but this DVD has more clips of kids singing and dancing, puppets, and family time than of Caillou cartoons. My daughter isn't interested in any of it and only wants to watch Caillou so I have to be sure I have the remote so I can skip over everything to get to the cartoons."
4,Even my little girls like it,"I have two little girls ages 2 and 3 and they are addicted to Caillou. We are used to watching the TV show on PBS, so the puppets in between the segments took a little getting used to. My little girls watch Caillou over and over. It's nice there is something that keeps them out of trouble, for at least a little while. BTW, I don't find Caillou ""Bratty"" at all, and I am a certified educator so I have experiences with children of all ages."
2,Shoes,I thought the shoes were the same kind that I have had for years but they are different and I do not like them as well as my old Easy Spirits.
5,Great Info in a quick and easy read...,"Mother's don't always have time to read...so I found this book to be a perfect book for my needs. It is a nice small book with the signs to look for, the false signs that many parents feel are 'signs', what parents do wrong most of the time, what they can do that is correct. the child's perspective on toliet training, etc...and it's 100% in line with my child development back ground...all the information fits well with most parenting styles...atachment parenting all the way to a more structured household. If you have a child that is gearing up to accomplish the big potty, I highly recommend this book before you get started. :)"
1,Not a good translation for Catholics,"St. John of the Cross was deeply Catholic. The translator has purposefully tried to remove this book from its Catholic roots and make a more universally acceptable translation. That may be fine for non-Catholic readers, though it does lessen the real truths behind what St. John wrote, but I would not recommend this translation to Catholic readers."
2,Spiritual Classic,"Were it not for the wonderful translation by Mirabai Starr of this work, I doubt I would have ventured to read it. The book is poetic and certainly one of the classics of mystical literature, but it is not ""light reading."" I found John of the Cross to be very traditionally Roman Catholic in his views (hardly surprising!) which frequently caused me to be confused rather than encouraged. Perhaps because I am not a mystic, I found it often difficult to comprehend John's cloudy ""explanations."" Mirabai Starr deserves great credit for her sensitive translation of what she describes as John's ""mystical masterpiece."""
1,A truly unpleasant surprise!,"I guess somewhere I missed that this book claims as its distinguishing characteristic that it is the first edition to be independent of the Church! Who this appeals to, I will never know! I don't know how you can separate John of the Cross from the Church and, frankly, if you could - what would you be left with? I think it is a question of white or wheat here ... some substance really matters. I highly recommend AGAINST this book! I think I paid as much to return this book as it cost to buy it in the first place and it was well worth the cost. I ultimately bought the ICS (Institute for Carmelite Studies) edition of St. John of the Cross' complete works ... it is fabulous and I highly recommend it!"
2,Superficial,"I was really excited to read this book. My professor had been talking about it as though it explained everything. So, I bought it. I am so dissapointed. First, there are 60 subjects and we only meet about 6 of them. She makes sweeping statements about what works (most of which of are obvious)and backs them up with one or two anecdotes, not exactly a large scale argument. For example, the second language chpater was so cursory it was almost insulting.It was easy to read and interesting, but I wanted so much more. I wanted to meet more of the subjects. I just don't understand how she can make such large conclusions and such superficial answers. Through the entire book, all I read was that the subjects should be relevant and interesting to the student, that's it. That is the big conclusion. Too bad."
2,Out of the game to long,"The music and arrangment were decent, nothing to write home about really. But lyrically this album was terrible."
2,Not as good as their first album!,The title says it all. It just seems that most groups or singers that try to make a comeback after so long just loses their magic touch and sounds rather lame in comparison to their first recordings. I would prefer singers who leave you wanting more (quit while their ahead) instead of trying to come back and make a last ditch effort to make a few bucks and disappointing their fans who felt cheated out of their money.
4,The Wonderground CD,"I enjoyed this CD. The music and harmonies were great. The musical arrangements were varied and fit the music well. The song ""Climbing"" is appropriate for today's troubled times. This is a CD that I find myself listening to again and again. Hats off to ""Boy Meets Girl"" (George and Shannon)."
5,Man! Can this man exhale.,"I give this album a 5 star rating because the playing is phenomenally exceptional. Nelson lets loose and expresses himself with pure energy. A very talented saxophonist atypical of the standard GRP fare.The only drawback I have with this release is that he hasn't a 'signature sound.' For example, Gato Barbeiri has the strained, seemingly imploding reed sound. Stanley Turrentine has the solid, classy, elegant embouchure and bold timbre. Paul Desmond has the dry, yet emotively sweet strain.Nelson's sound is like Sanborn's (which isn't bad) however it isn't particularly unique. A favorite cut is ""Grace."" Listen to the peaks and valleys of the expelled force of air on this cut and the sublime beauty--it is aptly named. Nelson needs to release more albums as this. Another must have for your collection."
4,Interesting Plot Devices,"This was a really good read for the most part. Exciting , interesting protaganists but the action just fell flat near the end...I loved the anti-hero element and think this could be a great series. Work on keeping that action consistant and please for goodness' sake let us *know* the miseries the bad guy (ie Camden) goes through. It's just not the same when we get to see the rest of the bad guys suffer and not the biggest baddie of them all. I want details on how he was made to pay for his sins. Voyeuristic? Perhaps, but so was my involvement all along the way. Kudos for Vandemark, he's a great character and I'd love to hear more about his adventures with his lady love. More of all the survivor's if you please...what *will* Leavitt do in retirement after being manhunter extraordinaire? I must know.Keep up the good work...just make sure you let me know how those bad guys bite the dust."
2,Not good overall; a few good singers,"I agree with the reviewer who wrote that this recording sounds ""wrong from the start"".But Ekkehard Wlaschiha is great as Klingsor. If you're into wagner's baritone villians, you have to hear him do it. He's one of the best contemporary character baritones. Listen to his alberich on Sawallich's RING (on EMI) or watch him in Levine's video RING or watch him as Telramund on the Schneider video of Lohengrin (with Werner herzog's scenery). His Klingsor is right up there."
1,The conductor fell asleep!,"What a pity!This recording has a really good cast, but an overrated ""conductor"" who apparently suffered from a severe lack of sleep totally ruins the performance. The tempi are so ridicuculously slooooow (while listening to this set which I fortunately do not own I had to start laughing several times) that this recording is spread like a chewing gum.Only order these 4 CDs if you desire to buy the worst recording available. Otherwise I recommend that you try one of the versions which include a true conductor. Solti, Boulez and Karajan offer quite different interpretations that are really worth listening to.Parsifal contains a lot of Wagner's most beautiful music, after all!"
2,So Disappointing,"I have never submitted a review before, but I decided to let others know how disappointing this recording is. I am a long-time fan of James Levine, and have always admired his ability to combine orchestral drama, beauty and sweep. However, this recording lacks all three; it is episodic and, ultimately, boring. Placido Domingo, who brings so much to his other Wagner recordings, seems off here, and Jessye Norman is, well, uninteresting. I am a big fan of the Barenboim and Solti recordings and would recommend either over this one."
2,Wrong from the start!,"From the very first bars, I couldn't get over the feeling of absolute wrongness about the wole thing. The sound seems to come out of a cavernous and heavily reverberant blackness and lacks the warm intimate spirituality that Kna was famous for. Act 1 is a write-off, neatly summarized in the grandiose and self-indulgent transformation scene. The recording fares better as the work progresses, though. Norman is the reason to get this set, as Domingo, one of the better voices in the title role, amounts to nothing more than a curiousity dramatically. Moll is good, but was in better surroundings with Karajan. Get either of Knappertbusch's, or go to Karajan or Solti!"
5,Evolutionary history of Earth and all life on it.,"A history of planet earth and all its life forms from its inception until the possible sixth extinction of the human race. My favorite part is the moment our aquatic ancestors took the first step from the ocean to the shore. A must for anyone who loves science, history or just loves to smile at the wonders of this ""Planet of Life""."
4,Terrific Tree,"Unfortunately I did pay the $29.99 for this online :-( Next time I'll do more research before buying items straight from here. The toy is very sparkley and pretty. The accessories are cute and fit in the oven for storing, and Minty fits inside the tree when closed, too. Overall its a nice toy!"
4,"Awesome Jazz, great Billy Taylor","I love this CD! Soo great! I love the song - ""back To My Dream"". All the great elements of jazz, fast...I was dancing.A must buy!"
3,"Yes, there is such a movement","Without comment on the merits of White's scholarship, I am glad to see people who share news that would be otherwise censored.Yes, there is such a movement, and even cardinals are involved. No, catholics will probably not like seeing this book (or any like it). It says a lot that the catholic church never excommunicates anyone who promotes such blasphemy.I have only seen this movement mentioned once in the mainstream media, in the New York Times. Here is information on that article if you have trouble even believing a church would promote such a thing, and would like to look it at online:Date: December 23, 2000, SaturdaySeeking a Promotion for the Virgin Mary By JAN JARBOE RUSSELLSource: The New York Times Section: Arts & Ideas/Cultural Desk"
1,No Mary Is Not Another Redeemer,"Take The Perfect Plan from The Alpha, and connect it to anything imperfect and it is diminished to nothing more than secular. The Virgin Mary assisted in no way to The Saviour's Work. To state she did, is placing a quark of nature into Perfection, and eliminates His Work, which did not happen.Yet Mary is most special. She did assist in The Saviour's earthly upbringing, being a most loving mother. God did look down on her with most favor, for He wouldn't have made her His earthly mother. Could The Virgin Mary been any woman? Obviously not; in His Perfect Plan, God Chose her. And though without sin,Mary still needed Christ's cleansing, for she was of nature.Again though, The Only Redeemer (and without earthly assistance) is Christ."
1,Mary-Another Redeemer,"Writing a book on this subject in the first place seems odd as the Pope has said an emphatic ""No!"" to the request to make Mary co-redemptrix. Of course, as a Protestant believing the man-made doctrine of ""private interpretation"" which the scriptures themselves condemn, what the Church says would be irrelevant to him - just writing the book in the first place, shows his ignorance of Catholicism. In this and all of his books against Catholicism, James R. White sets up a church he believes exists and shoots it down. The tragedy in all of this is that so many believe what he says without investigating the truth. This book gets a 1 from me, only because there is no provision for minus 20. It is not in any way, a scholarly work and it doesn't even make it as good fiction."
3,OFF THE MARK,"I WAS GIVEN THIS BOOK BY MY FRIEND WHO IS A PENTECOSTAL MINISTER IN OUR ON GOING FRIENDLY DEBATES. I WAS EAGER TO READ TO THE AUTHOR'S OPINIONS, I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED BY HIM IN THE PAST - PARTICULARLY DEBATES THAT HE HAS PARTICIPATED IN ON LONG ISLAND NY. YET, MR WHITE DOESN'T ADD ANY THING THAT HASN'T ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED BY OTHERS WITH HIS POINT OF VIEW."
3,Not Logical,"If you truly want to understand what the Roman Catholic Church teaches about Mary, it would make sense to ask a Roman Catholic. This book serves as a discussion of Protestant misconceptions, not Roman Catholic teaching. It's important to see all sides before reaching your own personal conclusions. I like Miravalle's Introduction to Mary for a quick survey of true Roman Catholic teaching."
1,I felt duped...,"I read the book, not realizing entire events were fictional. Then I read ""Enforcer"" and found out that Moe Dalitz died in his sleep and Tony Spilatro was killed by his own people. I felt duped -- this is not taking artistic license but complete falsification of reality"
2,what happened roemer?,"While the way the book is attempted to be written is clever, as it is almost like a Hollywood script of real events, the book is farfetched and is downright untrue in several instances.One glaring falsehood is that Moe Dalitz was shot down an then was later poisoned in a hospital.Roemer a former FBI agent, should have known better,escpecially considering he wrote briefly about Dalitz real demise in another book.If one takes this book for what it is, a story , it is enjoyable.The one interesting factual aspect about this book is the details given to the famous ""STRAWMAN"" cases which largely crippled organized crime in the midwest."
3,author doesnt make abolutely clear that book is fiction .,"since the author uses real characters, it is not clear that the story is fictional . for example he mentions and discusses actual crimes even though the reasons or timeing is not actual so by mixing fact with fiction story seems confused and i believe misleading."
2,Roemer's ego gets in the way of a fascinating story,"Growing up in the Oak Park area and knowing most of the characters involved in the book, I find it fascinating that Roemer uses an alter ego in Bill Richards instead of just using his own name. He drops names of people I know, so what's he hiding behind Richards for? He constantly pats himself on the back (Richards) and it made me put the book down several times. Did he use Richards so it didn't seem like he was talking about himself? I got sick of reading about him telling us what a great FBI agent he was. If he was so good, how come Accardo never went to jail?"
1,Crapola!,"I never expected this book to be that great from the get go.Just another Bill Roemer (the F.B.I. can do no wrong and I just adore J. Edgar book),but what a load of crap.I thought that his first book was pretty shoddy,but this one is something else.I haven't the slightest idea why this book was and is listed under the non- fiction category.P-U brother!I saw an interview with Roemer on TV some time ago and couldn't believe how in complete denial he was in regards to Edgars character.Forget about the rumors of his cross dressing and his (ahem)relationship with Clyde Tolson;his friendship with Frank Costello and Meyer Lansky;etc.He was a blackmailing,mean spirited bully.What a great period in the history of the F.B.I."
1,What the hell !!!!,What the hell happened??? Usually Roemer tells such great stories. In this one he goes way off track into some weird fictional stories. I was bummed cuz I expected another truthful account of mob history. Who knows what the hell he was on about this time
3,Fiction,As I was reading this book by Roemer I tried to think of some of the events actually happening and then I realized that this was fiction. I still liked the book even though it was fictional because it was somewhat entertaining.
3,Modest Tale of Fiction,"This is a book of fiction, a fact unknown by many readers (including myself) at the outset. It's a modest story with a ring of reality, but not in the same class as THE GODFATHER or other top mafia/mob fiction. It's the story of a mob struggle between the Bonanno family and the Chicago outfit to control Las Vegas in the 1980's. Yet the story fails to grab the reader as good fiction should. Perhaps that's because the real story is nicely described in CASINO (by Nicholas Pileggi), which details how Chicago and other Midwest syndicates received millions from casino skims before their scheme was uncovered in the 1980's.Author William Roemer (1926-1996) was an FBI agent assigned to the Chicago crime syndicate. He writes nicely readable prose, but Roemer does a better job with his non-fictional narratives on the Chicago outfit."
5,Return to health,"I got hold of this book now almost a decade ago, when I was badly injured from overtraining. Tendonitis was the name of my body. This book turned that around, and made me stronger in the process. If I have a gripe about this book, it is that it is not available in a hardcover edition: My paperback edition is worn out."
4,Excellent content but author needed an editor,"I've spent many long hours in the gym for 15+ years. I always modeled myslef after Arnold and followed his Encyclopedia of BB to the letter. At 240 lbs of muscle (6'2)I hit a brick wall. I just couldn't grow or get stronger. McRobert's book really turns the Arnold theory around. Having spent about 1 month now following the advice given in this book, I feel much more rested and ready to push to the limit. He recommends more compound movements whereas most BB mags push isolation. I am buying his later books also. Hopefully in these he will reveal to the readers how important it is to be a meat-eater if your goals follow what is written in his 1st book. 4/5 stars due to rambling writing style. Hard to follow."
5,This is a great book for beginners in weight traning.,I thought that the suggestions were well thought out and easy to implement into my own training regimen. I made some rapid mass and strength gains as well. This is the perfect book to help a beginner get started
5,Realistic Common Sense Advice for Building Muscle,"Most of the mainstream media on bodybuilding peddles advice suitable only for supermen and sets up expectations that the average weight lifter can never achieve. ""Brawn"" gives common sense advice in a down-to-earth fashion. Even the scrawniest pencil-neck could not help but pack on muscle by following ""Brawn's"" advice. It won't turn Woody Allen into Arnold Schwarzenegger, but it will work a magnificent transformation in anyone willing to take the book's precepts to heart."
3,Average at best,"Stuart has a paranoia about weight-training that makes one wonder whey he's even involved. Granted, he's had back problems, but there are many other ways of strengthening the body than by using his approach. Hardgainer methodology works for some, but so do many other techniques. I suggest reading this book after reading ""Science and Practice of Strength Training"" or the ""Poliquin Priciples"" to keep a balanced approach to your training.Bottom line, weight training should be a fun activity that benefits the body and mind. Stuart has a way of sucking the joy out of the activity."
4,a truly Universal Church work,"Hymns to Christ, I suspect, was conceived out of the art, the texts being secondary. The minatures selected to accompany the hymns come from 4 codices of the 13th and 14th centuries. They are well selected gems.Accompaning the minatures are ""hymns"" to Christ from the first millennium. I put ""hymn"" in quotes as there are a number of prayers, including liturgical prayers, and scriptural selections as well. But what a delightful diverse collection: Church Fathers such as Polycarp, Origen, Ephrem Syrus, Prudentius ; apocrypha such as Acts of Peter; a variety of Liturgies such as Chaldean, Syriac, Coptic, Armenian.The strength of the text is its diversity - the reminder to the Western Church of the influence and strengths of the Eastern Church. Similarly, the diversity reminds us of the different emphasises required for different people, for different times, and in different places."
4,"Good architecture, Good Website",This book has a lot of good implementations for an asp.netprogrammer. What I have found in a lot of beginner booksis that its only really enough information to suposedly get you up and running before going through a book like thisasp.net website book.This books has a very good ood design and the asp.net designand also the page composition is very impressive.I would have liked to have seen transaction implementation at the non-database component/module level which very few bookscover.Caching is also covered in this implementationThe technology that this book cover easily more than pays for the book
5,very well rounded book - must have,"It covers from naming conventions and good programming practices to any kind of functionality you would need to implement on a website - forums, advertising, file managing web interface, news management, polls, etc.It takes a real life approach to it developing a commercial application an it touches on requirements, design, architecture, practically everything.GREAT book."
2,reads more like a mystery than a reference book...,"The code is all over the place in this book. It is fragmented, very hard to follow and does not follow the Patterns and Practices from Microsoft for ASP.NET development.I realize the book is pretty old, but here are some major issues I found in the book...- namespace Vs folder structure Vs project namevaries from module to module- no step by step to make sure you can actually develop the application- very sketchy on how to use the IPrincipal and IIDentity classes- no ""here's why we did it this way"" descriptionsIt's just full of gaps and reads more like a mystery than a reference book. I usually find WROX books useful, but this one what a major disapointment. I hope that people consult the Microsoft docs before they use these approaches."
4,Great resource with an annoying flaw.,"I agree with previous reviews on the excellent content of this book. However, the demo site is hard-coded to run on a local machine installation only. This means the development system must be running SQL Server, IIS, and VS.NET. I would guess that the majority of developers that this title targets are using 2 or more systems running these servers.Adaptation to a remote SQL Server is not a big deal, but there are many instances of hard coded localhost URLs throughout the application. I simply do not want to be mired in the process of configuring the application to run on more realistic platforms.I hope they offer revised code to accomodate this in the future."
4,A reference book for developing a commercial web site,"I did not like the layout of the matiral, a bit clombsy but as a refernce book for finding out how to develop a commercial web site it sure does the work."
4,A practical book for ASP.NET developers,"This book is not for ASP.NET beginners. It is intended for developers that have a good understanding of ASP.NET, C# and ADO.NET.ASP.NET Website Programming is an accurate documentation of a professional Web site design and implementation: THEPHILE.COM, a Web site for DVD and books enthusiasts. The site's features implementation are described following a pattern highlighted by the subtitle of the book: Problem, Design, Solution. In other words, the authors analyze the Problem to face, give a Design of the Solution and implement it. This pattern is applied to each chapter.Many common Web site festures are taken into account: from navigation management to user authentication, from news publishing to advertising, from polls and mailing list implementation to forum and online communities management.This book gives a practical vision of using ASP.NET features and a good methodology to software design and implementation."
5,If you only buy one ASP.NET book - buy this one!,"My story is typical:I am an experienced programmer who needed to write an ASP.NET project for a client. I have ASP, SQL Server, COM+, and C# experience and needed a book to get my project jump started.This book is simply amazing!By reading and implementing the techniques discussed, my project is up and running and has a very solid architecture that will allow me to extend the website as my client's needs change.I buy A LOT of books and this is the first time I have ever been moved to write a review!Kevin and Marco, thank you very much for taking the time to write such a high quality book.George"
2,Too focused,Only thing I got out of this book was some Email techniques. It's too focused on a particular solution.
1,How could they screw it up anymore??///,I Loved the first season and thought it was (is) one of the best anime out there but then they go and take the heart and soul from the characters by taking away their original voices. I watched the movie and in the extras they said it would happen but I had hoped it was some kind of a mistake. I recognize the voices in reloaded from other anime films and in those other films their voices fit but in Saiyuki they do not. Like others I ran out to purchase Saiyuki Reloaded and found it disapointing to the point of not being able to follow the story line. I am re-selling this item and will purchase no more of this series. To me Saiyuki died with the lost voices.
3,Nought New,"I agree with the general consensus that the new voice actors and dialogue don't fit with the characters as established with the first series. Some of the new pronunciations make me cringe, and the ""new"" Hakkai sounds like he's positively flaming. The character is cool enough not to need overkill! The artwork seems to be pretty inferior at times, too.Still, I enjoyed the opening and closing music, and the episode extras (Urasai) are hilarious."
3,"Funky and Cute, but Over-priced and Uncomfortable","I love how these shoes look. Which is probably why I bought them in the first place. However, I've owned them for more than a year now and probably worn them 6 times. This would be okay if they weren't a little bit out of my price range (at least at the time that I purchased them). They are definitely funky (I got them in Ginger), and I love the stud detail, but they are pretty uncomfortable. I wear high heels regularly, and feel as though I am pretty forgiving of high heels and their level of comfort, but I try to wear these only if I know I don't have to walk very far and am going to be sitting down for the majority of the time that I am wearing them.Overall, a definite conversation piece and added spice to any wardrobe, but think seriously about how much use you plan on getting out of them considering the price you'll pay..."
2,wrong item,"I bought the Centric Brake rotor for my 2005 Jaguar S-type. When the mechanic took the tire off, he stated that the rotor that i bought from you was not the same size. I contacted you and you told me to return the rotor. I was charged 20 dollars for returning the wrong part. Why does the customer have to be punished for that mistake. I hope that you can rectify the situation or do I need to contact Amazon?"
1,Uncomfortable Shoes,These shoes are very uncomfortable and not good looking. I am disappointed with my purchase. Sorry!Angie Mekkelson
4,living legend,"Ed Kuepper has experienced the highs and lows of the industry, and has probably been his own worst enemy so far as earning money to sustain a carreer goes. That said, he is my favourite Australian recording artist - keeps me broke as he is prolific in the extreme. For the uninitiated, this isn't a bad place to start. Has an intelligent song selection ( largely recent material), and it really kicks on. Confessions of a window cleaner is my favouite, for power, melody, and lyrics. Very knowing number."
2,improper advertising,I thought this meant I was getting 6 bags of this food. I only received 1 bag... 3.5lbs. What does 6 Pack mean? My cats don't like it either.
2,Great Series...But Poor Quality,"I am a Twin Peaks lover, so I ordered all the the VHS sets. The tapes were recored on EP so the sound goes in an out and the picture is fuzzy on a good entertainment system...wait for a dvd."
3,Eureka Tub Of Money,"I was excited when I first purchased this play money set for my daughter who is home schooled. I felt for the price I was getting a great deal, but when it came in I was sadly disappointed. Unfortunately the money is not realistic at all. The bills are very small and very thin (about half the size of a real dollar), making it difficult for children to handle. They are also black and white! The item description says the money is ""realistic"" But the bills are very small and look like they are photocopied! Don't waste your money, buy a better set!! I recommend Melissa & Doug Co. play money set. it looks like a much better quality and more true to life set."
1,Not Realistic,These coins are so unrealistic that children just learning money won't even recognize them for what they are. They are dollar store quality. They barely look like money to me and I'm an adult. I found a better set for about the same amount at a teacher supply store that were much more realistic. I wouldn't bother.
5,Used real money to trade for fake ...,but it was worth it! My daughter LOVES her cash register but sadly it was lacking in play money. Whenever her friends come over they were fighting over FAKE money. I gave them REAL money to play but none of the kids had any interest! Go figure!So I traded real money for this play money and now EVERYONE is happy when they play supermarket.
2,*shakes head ruefully*,"I really thought the Juliana Theory were capable of so much more. I would've been okay with the album- I mean, hey, not all of a band's records will be great- had they not reworked 'Into the Dark'. The original was perfect- the chorus had an incredible melody and Detar's voice only served to complement it. Here, his attempts at vocal acrobatics weigh the entire song down. They really should've let it be."
2,whats the big deal?,"well i'll have to admit that i technically haven't heard much of emotion is dead, but i think that's a bonus. i hear thats a pretty good album, and that may have made me feel sorry for this particular outing.to put it simply, love by the juliana theory is just boring. similar to the new foo fighters album one by one, there really isn't anything there to make me want to listen. in fact, i think the lyrics are really really derivative. they don't seem to have any real emotion behind them, and too many cliches permeate the album for me to apprecieate them. there are moments when i'll be really into the music, and then he says something stupid and the whole song is ruined for me.this cd just really isn't my style. try further_seems_forever - the_moon_is_down, thursday - full_collaps, etc... but don't try this one. or at least download it before you buy. it may save you some $$."
3,I've lost that lovin' feelin',"To tell you that this music is bad would be a poor review, however, if you were like me, you would expect to hear that same ""emo"" sound from The Juliana Theory that you are used to. This is not the case with their latest album. A once unique band has ""evolved"" into the average rock band. I paid six dollars for this cd, making it the cheapest one i have ever purchased; but it still left me feeling as if my money had gone to waste. If you are expecting the same sound as Emotion Is Dead, then it will be anger, not love, that you feel when you realize that you just tossed your money on an average rock album. Again, this is an average album, not a bad album; its just not emo. So dont buy it if your looking for that particular style music."
1,it brings a tear to my eye...,"wow, what happened to a really good band? This album was so hyped up and over anticipated. The release date was pushed back and everything. You would think this cd would be amazing. Nope, it brings a tear to my eye that such a great band like Juliana Theory could ruin something good. This album starts off like its going to be Hard and good but then it goes right into mellow all the way out. Dont get me wrong i like the mellow Juliana Theory durring understand this dream is over, but this sounds like its Our Lady Peace. Its been out of my cd player ever since. my advice is burn it, dont buy it."
1,What Happened,"The Juliana Theory which originally started out as an underground emo fan favorite has signed to Epic Records, I prayed after hearing that statement that it wouldn't ruin them. The band that had two great full length studio albums on Tooth-n-Nail and a decent ""Music From the Other Room Ep"" has put out in my opinion their worst album. Maybe it's the over produced sound, or the fact that Brett Deter sings so much different on this album than the others, but this was a disappointment to me as a fan who has seen them countless times live. I just hope that the next Juliana Theory album is more like the last two, and nothing like this one, because as of right now I'm truely sorry I bought this album."
1,Aweful,This Cd was an absolute let down in every way. There is not one song i look forward 2 listening to on the entire album. I got this album bc Understanding This is a Dream is one of the best albums i own and then i figured that there is no way they could have made a worse album than Emotion Is Dead but i was very wrong. I regret ever buying this album and if i ever meet the guys of Juliana Theory i will slap them for disgracing there music as much as they did.
3,Please enter a title for your review,"Most of these songs are pretty bad. They've taken on a much more simplistic grungy alternative-rock style with most of them. White Days and Shell Of A Man are quite good though. On their last album they wrote radio-ready music that went beyond basic formulas, creating some of the best songs ever made. Here they seem like they got lazy. A lot of this album sounds like it could have been written by Staind or Nickelback, and to me that kind of music is completely at odds with everything I thought The Juliana Theory was about musically."
1,a jualiana theoritcal let down.,"I will admit that i was expecting a lot from this cd when i first picked it up, but if i ever wasted [money] ... it was on the purchase of this cd. I found that at most, there are 2 tracks on this cd that i can appreciate, and one of them is a remake of an older song (Into The Dark). I Would not recommend this album to anyone that has liked there older stuff. If you have never heard juliana theory, go ahead and make the purchase... you might like the played out,over used, fake sound."
3,hmm,"the agressive sound that doesn't really live up to their emo past is not bad, but it's quite repetitive and generic. And its too bad their lyrics are horrible in this one. Sounds more like he's talking than singing, which is never a good thing for any artist. it almost feels as if they're are covering up the mediocre lyrics with their hard energy coming from the riffs and bassand all the songs sound the same. I liked the chanting in ""Do you believe me?"" and that was about it."
1,new juliana theory cd is a biggggg disappointment!,this new rock stuff just is not cutting it. very weak cd. if you wanna hear juliana at their best buy understand this is a dream or emotion is dead
1,"Wow, Emotion is Dead was a great album....","Emotion Is Dead was a great album, so I was excited to see a new full length on the horizon. I ignored the terrible reviews, and I bought it. ...Everything that was great about 'Emotion' is gone. Most of this album sounds like really bad 80's faux metal. Not good times. The rest sounds like the worst of 90's alt rock. Unfortunately, no timely screaming to save even one horrific song. There are a couple of listenable tunes, but only if you have nothing better to listen to. Overall, this is a totally wasted effort - and I like these guys. But, a better album title for this would be ""Originality is Dead"". I mean, ""I'm burning the candle at both ends...while holding it under water"" doesn't sound any better or more intelligent when it is set to bad music. Hopefully, they will bounce back, because they have made good music before. This is not it. ..."
5,Juliana Theory.,Are you absolutely insane? The best part of TJT is that they take their music to a whole new level. Everyone expects the same old thing but with each song there is a new beat and outstanding lyrics you can relate to no matter what mood your in. Its one of those cd's where you are able to jam out in the car to but then its one you can sit in your dark room crying. It hits up all emotions. Get it its so worth you money!
2,This album just isnt as good.,"If you're already a tjt fan, and have come to love the music on any of the other cd's, prepare to be let down. The sound of tjt has changed, rather than being completely unique it seems to have blurred towards the rest of today's ""alternative"" music. Even the singer seems to have lost his edge (that before was something completely unique) and doesnt put the same kind of unique sound to his lyrics.If you're already a tjt fan, i'm sorry, this album is probably not for you... it's more or less the ""let's get ourselves on mtv"" sellout album. Though I don't want to call it bad, it's by far the worst album they have put out.However, if you don't know the band already, this is probably a great album to buy. It's a good band, I used to love em, but you can have the new stuff."
4,The Juliana Theory Is Good For Anybody,"TJT, this is a good cd its not my favorite one from them, my favorite one is Emotion is Dead. They are such a good band they are going to be around for a while.... Every cd just keeps getting better and better."
3,Sometimes Love ain't enough...,"I first heard Juliana Theory a few months ago. Emotion is Dead immediately became one of my favorite albums. But when I first listened to this I was underwhelmed. It's not BAD, but it leaves you wondering what happened to this great band. It wasn't what I had expected. I felt very let down. It didn't meet my expectations at all. It's not that it's a bad album... it's just not great. Not a single track stands out from the rest. If you're expecting another ""If I Told You This Was Killing Me,"" you'll be sorely disappointed. And the much talked about ""Into the Dark"" remake is bland. Not to say there aren't a few okay songs. ""Do You Believe Me"" and ""DTM"" are the best songs on the disc, but they're not strong enough to carry the album.If you're a big Juliana fan, you'll probably buy and like this album. But if you're not a big fan you probably want to avoid Love. Buy Emotion is Dead instead."
5,Good Stuff,"I've been a fan of TJT since the beginning. The first time i saw them was in Pittsburgh in 8th grade and i'm a senior now. Their music style keeps changing but it doesn't matter, they're still awesome. I've seen them multiple times and recently got to seem them do an acoustic performance in Pittsburgh. I just gotta say that these guys are awesome. All of their albums are great. I can honestly say there is not one song i don't like, well ""Show me the Money"" off Understand This is a Dream gets a bit repetative but i still enjoy the music. If you don't own any of their stuff CHECK IT OUT!! i promise you will like something of theirs! This album is another example of their constant changing and molding style. IT's great!!!!!!!!"
4,"Good, but the older stuff is better","This is a great album. I had to listen to it a few times, before I got use to it. Even though I'm a huge emo fan, I still like this album. For the rest of you emo fans, this is not a emo album. I still like ""Understand this is a Dream"" more, I do think this album is better than ""Emotion is Dead""."
4,"great recording, but the songs were lacking","$100,000 recording should do an album good, but they should have had a $100,000 album before it went into the studio, and it obviously isnt. Still a good listen, and great buy."
4,Keepz it rockin',"The Juliana Theory was able to put out yet another awesome album. With similarities from ""Emotion is Dead,"" with a mix of harder songs such as ""Repeating, Repeating"" and the softer slower songs with a bit of piano on tracks such as ""Shell of a Man"", it is definately an album you can listen to anytime. Brett's emotion is evidently powerful in many of the tracks. Although, I'm not sure it is better than Emotion is Dead, but it is equally as good. With time, I'm sure this will be one of my fav. emo cdz.."
5,AWESOME ALBUM,"This album is the best thing thats ever happened to music. The Juliana Theory is an amazing band they are so great. YOU NEED TO BUY THIS CD!!!! Trust me, you wont be dissapionted."
4,"Enjoyable, but not amazing","I like Juliana Theory, and thus I will like most all of there stuff. However this CD is just ""ok"" in my books. Nothing that I will put in my CD player and listen to for a week straight. Nothing you rush out and buy in stores, but if you're a fan of the group you might want to pick up a copy online for cheap."
1,not worth it,"This product worked okay probably for the first two uses. Even then it was difficult to remove from outlet in my car. Now for the ""GOOD"" part, the end that goes into the outlet kept falling apart and I kept putting it back together. One day, I unplugged it, it fell apart and the spring from the inside flew into the air and landed somewhere in my friend's car. That was the end of the inverter (which was more like a puzzle because I had to keep putting it back together). I only used it about 6 times."
1,Don't Waste Your Money.,"Unethical review practices aside, this book isn't that great. I had a look at Borders and I was not impressed by either the content nor its organization. Of all the InDesign CS books I've seen (or seen described so far), Scott Kelby's interests me the most... essentially because he does such good work on his Photoshop books that I know a certain level of quality will be achieved there."
1,Not up to scratch,I agree...it's completely lame for the author to review his own book. Looking things over including the author's site it's clear that he may have the technical skills but has terrible design skills. Check out his site for a demo of his work as he suggests...This book would be a waste of your time and money.
4,Fancy Applique',"I am very impressed by the format that Elly Sienkiewicz used in her book of ""Fancy Applique'"". The novice sewer to the professional quiltmaker can learn something. It's simple to read, step-by-step instruction in how to begin each block makes the sewer feel more and more confident as she/he proceeds through the twelve lessons. The first lesson teaches the basic steps of setting up the block for applique', to teaching each stitch that is used for that block. As you proceed though the lessons, each block will teach a new technique and additional stitches to make the person feel more confident. The novice can take this book and learn to become a master in applique', the professional can take this book and teach classes in fancy applique'. Each lesson provides a detailed list of all supplies needed to complete each block, until you have enough beautiful blocks to make a quilt anyone would love to have."
2,"NOT a fabric floral applique, alot ribbon embellishments","I had thought the book would contain much more on appliqued fabrics for flowers, birds etc. What was given was many forms of appliqued hearts, and a few other background applique projects to show off ribbon applique/embroidery. In that, I was very disapointed, by ordered online.But if you want the book for those ideas and projects, it is excellent.My seller was TOPS! Couldn't ask for beter."
5,Baltimore Applique,"This book is by far the best of all the Baltimore Album books. Details of the how to's to make a more beautiful final product. Dealer send exactly what was described, timely shipping which was not ridiculously priced."
2,Good design...Bad Material,"I bought this for my son at the beginning of the school year. His middle school does not allow students to carry backpacks around during school hours. He uses it to carry books from his locker to class, never more than one subject at a time. He does not have it loaded to capacity with just 1/2 a pack of notebook paper and one spiral, some pencils, pens, highlighter and a small daily organizer. He loves all the little pockets it has for storage, the x-strap for his books and spiral. However, it began to tear near the zipper within the 2nd week. It has now completely ripped through and I know that he does not ever have it loaded so that he has to sit to zip it. Again my son does love this design. (He wants me to purchase him another binder just like it) I'm not sure I will since it does not seem to be very sturdy. Maybe just making it out of that ripstop material would help."
3,A10 Cuba - Good old FS.,"Still a pleasure to fly. Never mind the outdated physics engine compared to this days standards, the flight model is exelent, and this game was pioneering Virtual cockpit and on-dashboard mouse controll. Runs well on an old NT4 box. Wonder if it runs under Virtual PC ?"
5,A reflection of myself,"""Poems of Survival"" by Sue HoltISBN 0 9542218 9 3ChipmunkapublishingI have read a lot of Sue's poetry. The poem that I could identify with the most was """"Manic Mind"". Sue has eloquently expressed raw and emotional feelings. As I read, I was transported back to times when I had gone through the panic of mania, the fear, the craziness, and all the things Sue felt deep within her because I have been there, and I know those feelings all too well. Then having to battle the hole of depression - almost clutching for life, self-harming and shame. Knowing someone could understand what I go through moved me. Oh! How this is a demon we fight. I thank Sue for giving this as an explanation for those we desperately want to understand.Thank you Sue for sharing your vulnerability and your talent."
5,POEMS OF SURVIVAL - SUE HOLT,Holt submerges her life experiences of manic depression within her deeply moving and inspirational poetry. Her language is dark and grabbing and she is a highly skilled poet at evoking pathos. This is my favorite book of poetry and I recommend it to anyone.
3,You get what you pay for.,"First of all, the item description should state that this does NOT come with a cord to plug in. It is meant to be wired up to work all the time. I guess I will blame myself for not knowing this because I needed one so badly I did't read the reviews. I just hope that once I recieve the cord instilation kit I have no more issues and can finally use it! READ REVIEWS!"
4,OK for the Price,"I purchased this item on Amazon.com due to range hoods being so expensive at the big box retailers. When I received the item it had mild damage (which seems to be a trend with these range hoods), however the damage was minor and I was able to straighten out 2 small dents, avoiding having to return it. Overall the range hood looks fine and works well, exhausting most smoke and steam on the lo fan setting. It is rather noisy but that's to be expected at this price. If you're looking for an economical range hood for a good price, this is it. Just hope when it arrives it's not damaged."
3,GREAT HOOD WRONG FILTER,"Hood is well worth the money but until Amazon change the website DONT REPEAT DONT buy theBroan BPSF30 Non-Ducted Filter Set for 30-Inch Allure, 2-Pack that the website suggests as this is not the correct NON DUCTED FILTER, you need to look up Broan part number 97007696.otherwise you will be doing what i have had to do, sent the filters back and reorder elsewhere.not problem getting return authorised just have to hunt down the right ones now."
4,Broan Convertible Range Hood,"We so appreciate being able to get a range hood at such a good price!Though it's not a real quiet hood, it's quieter than the previous one we had. We also really appreciated the fact that it's convertible and fits any kind of installation need with the heat's output area."
4,Very Nice Deal For The Price !!!,I did look for this range hood for a couple of days and in several places and I found this very atractive for the price... Took me like 1 hour to install and this one was the cheapest out there by far. Very Nice Deal For The Price !!!
5,Better than I expected at the price,"I'm not sure how quiet one can expect a fan at this price (< 50) to be, but I'm pleased with the performance and sound level of this one. Have had several in my lifetime, all were louder than this, and most cost more. Was easy to install -- he had it up in less than an hour (non-vented). Effective at keeping the area clear of smokey food smells, and light keeps cooking surface bright."
2,Damaged goods,The one I ordered had a rather large dent in it above the fan/light toggle switch area. Order a replacement though Amazon got it in two day but it too had a dent above the toggle switch. The second hoods dent was worse then the first.
2,I would not buy again,I just received and installed this unit yesterday. It is kind of flimsy. It came without a cord so I had to go to home depot and buy a cord and plug along with some wire nuts. That bit added about $10-$15 and a few minutes to the cost of the product. I also had to buy the non-vented filter (product #97007696). Add another $10 for that part. Add a light bulb.It is very loud.
3,average but inexpensive,"The product was 1 inch shorter than the hood it replaced which made the installation more difficult! If this hood had not been a convertible unit, I would have ordered the wrong exhaust application. It fit my need and price range."
4,Good Value,Needed to replace our old range hood and was not looking for anything fancy. This one definitely fits the bill. It was easy to install and works just fine but is a little loud. I chose the free super saver shipping option that says 7-10 business days. I had it within 3 days. Overall I am very pleased with the unit but remember it is an economy range hood with limited options.
4,Appears to exhaust smoke well....,"This unit was considerably less expensive than any I saw on Amazon, but I'm pretty happy with it. Certainly no louder than my original unit, and seems to be more efficient. A little trouble installing, but I think that might have been more about operator error. Can't speak for durability yet, as I've had in installed for about 6 weeks. Looks more expensive than it was, and I would buy this product again."
2,Painful Reading,"It is clear thet Munz did her research, it is her writing style that i found painful.There is almost nothing in the book on Timurs actual battles and campiaigns. Just a couple of sentances. Instead the book becomes a never ending list of Turcoman Mongolian names and tribes. It becomes very tedious.Concentrating on Timurs realtionship with the many internal Turcoman Mongolian tribes, it becomes extremely frustrating, as you begin to long for some intersting story or narrative of a great battle or exploit. Anything of any interest is skipped over in lines!One point that i felt was not adressed in Manz's obsession with Turco/Mongolian internal tribal politics was the factor of how differing percentages of Turco or Mogloinan heritage within the tribes affected tribal relationships.Summing up..... a great deal of deatiled information on Timur is included in this book, but not all the exciting information you want to know about!!"
3,Not really a miracle. Just a good knife.,"I think I may have been expecting more than what I got. I've only had them for over a week. The knives are sharp, but how long they last I don't know. The handles seem like they are made from cheap China plastic (and probably are). Also the grip on a few of them aren't ideal. I was using a steak knife and my hand slid right down the handle, only a minor wound but I will be paying closer attention from now on. Overall they get the job done pretty quickly, but aren't what I'd call a nice set of knives."
2,Stainless Steel?? I'm not so sure.,"Okay so I started using these knives literally three weeks ago and over half of them have started to show signs of rusting (all the steak knives and both slicers). I thought the whole point of stainless steel was that it wasn't supposed to rust. But either I've been misinformed or Miracle Blade is LYING. There is no way these are actually stainless steel. I've gone through my entire life never seeing a stainless steel item rust. Except these knives. To be fair, the knives are very sharp (except the paring knife).All I have to say is:BUYER BEWARE"
3,Maybe Maybe Not,"I have loved these knives for almost a year. However, the filet knife broke tonight. After reading about the non responsive customer (no) service, I am wondering if I will ever hear from the company even though I have registered my knives once by mail and once on-line. The knives have worked great, however, if a company will not stand by their product don't waste your money -- vote with your feet and pick a better made product with a company that will stand behind their product."
2,steak knives,I have found that the steak knives are dull as well as the scissors after a short period of time.One of the steak knives broke off at the handle and I have been E-mailing customer service for 6 months now with NO response back. I have tried the 800 number several times at different times of the day and it always says there are no represenatives avail. and please call back... I would not buy these knives again...
1,Miracle Blade Scam,"This company can not be trusted. They are expert at deception. From their website to their so called ""customer service"". Believe all the negative reviews you read here. Save yourself some frustration and ""money""......STAY AWAY"
1,NEED A STORAGE BLOCK!!!,"I have also heard wonderful things about this knife set, but they will do me no good without a block. I don't understand how Target can sell knives without one."
4,Awesome,These knives are super sharp! We love this set and use it just about everyday. It's also a great price for the amount of knives you get and the quality.
5,GREAT SET OF KNIVES,"I have owned a set of these knives for a very long time since they came out for sale, I use them every day and find them very handy to use. I have not experanced the rusting problem others are talking about as yet, however I take good care of them to. I have one drawer in my kitchen that I store all my very sharp knives in to avoid getting cut. I also sharpen all my kitchen knives once or twice a year with a electric knife sharpener and also use other sharping tools for touch up while I work. I enjoy cooking and believe it shouldn't be a strugle to do so. I would recomend these to all especally at half price... I just bought my second set..."
3,Okay for a couple of years,"I cook a lot, and have depended on these knives for a couple of years. They're cheap but they work. The serrated knives hold their edge. The scissors broke after a few months. They were sold at a discount drug store for under twenty dollars."
5,You will never find a better value!,"This is the second time I purchase these knives and will continue to do so.They really do cut and cut and cut like the energy bunny, I have given them as gifts. I will never buy any other knifes. I have recommended them to all I know. Enjoy!This supplier shipped them out better than promised, I received in three days from ordering. Excellent service."
2,Rust,"These knives cut well, but they rust with just one trip through the dishwasher. Wash them by hand."
2,Ratings- Miracle Blade Knives,"The knives are ""ok"". Could get just as good knives at WalMart.The warranty service is TERRIBLE! You will be saddened to know that you'll have to wait upwards of 2 months (maybe longer) to get your replacement knives. I have placed multiple phone calls to the customer service, only to state that they have not been shipped yet. (of course, the $5.00 shipping charge was IMMEDIATELY billed to my account). I would reccommend as a fellow consumer not to waste your time with these knives. Spend a few extra dollars and get a much better knife, all the meanwhile, not having to deal with the warranty/replacement ""guarntee"". You'll be upset."
1,NOT the sharpest knife in the drawer!!,"I got a set of these for my birthday. I was thrilled. For about 10 minutes. The knives worked fine the first couple of times I used them. Do not put them in a dishwasher, they will rust! The filet knife is shaped wonderfully but it will not hold an edge. I used it for cutting unfrozen raw boneless beef. The chop and scoop larger flat knife was my favorite. I was very disappointed when, one day I was 'scooping' up some onions I had sliced and the blade broke in half!!!I would not waste my money on these."
1,great for the first month,"I love to cook and a good knife will facilitate your cooking experience. The first time I used the miracle blade knives I was amazed by how sharp they were, but within a month or two the sharpness was not there anymore. The life-time guarantee is excellent but there is a shipping charge of about 6 dollars for a new set of 3 knives, and there are about 11 knives to replace. Like I said the knives are great when they are new, but the info-mercial is full of it. I dont cut hammers with them and they are still dull."
2,"Yes, they do rust...","I ran into these reviews because I was searching on the net for Sharpkut (which someone mentioned in a review of this product) The reason I am looking for a set of the Sharpkut is because I am so disappointed in the Miracle Blade knives. I received a set as a Christmas present in 2003 and started using them about mid-2004. They are very sharp which is the only reason did not give them a rating of 1. Within a month they started showing rust spots on them. I never knew stainless steel would rust. Every time I pull one out of the dishwasher and have to scour it to get the rust off I think of my 25 year old Sharpkut bread and paring knife that I'm still using and are still sharp after all these years. Today, after once again seeing the rust on the Miracle Blades (it's a ""Miracle"" stainless steel rusts?), I decided to do something about it. I hope the Sharpkut are made as well today as they were 25 years ago because I'm about to buy a set of them and throw out the Miracle Blades!"
4,Fantastic for the price!,"For less than $50, I love these knives!If you want the best sharp, rust-resistant knives, you need to buy a Wustof-Trident set for $400!These knives are incredibly sharp (watch your fingers!), have a good variety of uses (I love the rock and chop!), and are great for the price. I've had mine for over 2 years and there is not a speck of rust on any of them. However, I hand wash and dry them, they never go in the dishwasher, and are always put back in the block completely dry! (I wouldn't machine wash an expensive set either!)The few downfalls I can think of are these: they look cheap (they're your typical black plastic...not fancy dinner party material), and some are actually too sharp (I don't use the paring knife as I would the one in my other set...I can't cut towards my finger when peeling potatoes or veggies, because I will cut my finger)."
5,Miracle Blade Knives - the best I've used - ever!!!,"I received these knives(I have the miracle blade II set) from my father last Christmas. As it happened, we really needed a new set of knives. Wow! These knives are fantastic! Not too long after I got mine, a friend of ours bought a set, and she is just as pleased with her knives. They not only look nice, they actually do the job! Now, I wouldn't have anything else!"
2,Watch for flying broken blades!,"If you plan to purchase this product, NEVER treat these knives like so called Chef Tony did. The cheaply made filet knife broke with a slight bend, stickers fell off within a week, and they all became dull with common use. The slicer is great for bread, though all of the blades are made from inferior metals. Hype sells, but not good product most of the time."
3,Perfect except for low grade stainless.,"I prepare all my meals using this set and it's excellent. It works as advertised. My only issue is the stainless is low grade so after a while just like Wal-Mart stuff it begins to rust. The steak knives are garbage within a few weeks, the bread knife is great, thr sissors are good, the choppers are good except when they rust. A slightly higher grade of these exact knives would be great."
3,disappointing but okay,"I'm a big fan of Michael Moore, and after seeing Captalism, A Love Story, I was inspired to see more of his work which I hadn't yet seen. When I learned about the awful Truth, it sounded quite good, but after watching only 2 or 3 episodes, I just wasn't very impressed, both with the format and content. One of the episodes was,IMO, better than the others and was kind of worth seeing, but I was not inspired to watch the rest, at this time. I might return to it for the remainder because Michael is generally so good."
4,"No smell, no smoke","I haven't experienced either of the issues expressed here, so that's good. I have found that this pan gets very hot very quickly, so you should have your food ready and watch it somewhat closely...all in all, I'm happy enough with this pan that I'm purchasing a whole calphalon hard anodized set."
3,Good alternative to outside grill,"The grill pans works well and cooks boneless chicken breasts in 10 minutes with nice grill marks. The downside is that even with the exhaust fan on high, the entire house smells like smoke when you are done. I did not notice any unusual odor, just the smoke from the food being cooked. It also generates a lot of spatter on the stovetop. If you can live with those 2 downsides, you will like it. It is easier to clean that a George Forman Grill."
2,Great for a rag,"This is an awesome looking shirt. The problem is that it tears apart ""Hulk Hogan"" style if you don't remove it with EXTREME caution."
3,Funny color,"Our changing table is on the yellow end of the natural wood spectrum. It's not as piney as the one in the picture, and worse yet, it doesn't come close to matching the Alpha mini rocking crib that is in the same collection. That piece is the piney color we expected.Structurally, it seems pretty sound despite the cardboard shelves. They're not as flimsy as, say, the cardboard backing on cheap bookshelves. I think it will be fine for clothes, diapers, and blankets. I am a total baby novice, but the changing pad seems perfectly adequate to me and I won't be trading up."
4,Wrong Color,"The changing table is beautiful. I put it together myself with no problem, and it's extremely sturdy. Especially considering the low price. My only complaint is the color is not like what is shown. I wanted it to match all the furniture in my daughter's room, which is a light natural wood, however this is much darker than the picture. It's more of a honey color."
5,Nice and sturdy..,It Looks a lot better in person. It's very nice and sturdy...you feel like the baby will be safe.I recommend this product to anyone.
2,Poor imported quality,"This product is a very cheap construction, especially with respect to the shelves. The shelves are very thin plywood with a veneer. This gives this a load bearing capacity of maybe enough to hold some diapers, but I would expect this to break if anything substantial were to be placed on them. The top shelf is reinforced with a metal brace. To make thing worse, in my case, the metal brace it shipped with was the wrong part, and I am currently trying to obtain a replacement from the manufacturer. I currently have a changing table sitting in the baby's bedroom that can't be used safely because of the lack of a critical part. I'll update this with my experience from that."
4,Decent quality for the money,"We have been using this table for 1.5 years now and it has held up well to daily use. My only complaint is that the bottom two shelves are not supported underneath, so when any sort of weight is put on them, they sag. The bottom shelf in my unit is constantly coming undone from the sides and falling thru to the floor."
2,Disappointed,"Item arrived quickly however two main parts arrived cracked. I immediately reported it through email (only way, no contact phone #)with the required pictures and yet no response/parts/update after two weeks. For someone who needs a changing table right way try to order from another vendor with a better exchange/refund/service policy. I will never order from them again or refer my friends to them."
2,this is myy opinion,"ok so i ordered this item online, and i waited a week for it. when i opened it at my house it looked NOTHING like the picture. the picture shows the pink covering the letter part of the phone (which is what i wanted to cover). and also the item does not cover the letters, and i was very disappointed because i thought i finally thought i found what i was looking for... but i guess not"
4,great for on the go,came on time. I think that us very useful instead of using plasitc. the size is right for me. if you snack a lot and are on the go maybe you should look into this.
4,Great Lunch Boxes,"I Do Love This Lunchbox. My Daughter Has Major Challenges Opening The Lid Of The Small Container, Even Adults Struggle With Opening It. I Do Recomend These Containers. & What A Neat Look, Everyone Compliments Her Lunch Box!!!"
1,Broken,"We used this three or four times and the item split. Then the top broke off. Sad, I had hoped to use it for at least 5 years!"
2,Clips popped off after a week,The clips should have been riveted on instead of spot welded. This also created a rust spot where the clips attach. Please make again out of 18/10 stainless and provide a better closing mechanism. Rivets would be a huge plus. Looked and felt cheap when it arrived I'm not sure if buying this is any better than using disposable lunch bags since this is just as disposable. Looks nice but thats it.
2,Better than plastic lunch box but pain in your fingers sooner or later,I did not like this Stainles Lunch Box because the 4 clasps are very tight.It makes loud noise when open/close it and with pain in your fingers sooner/later you will have it and you will take more pain medicines or visitting doctor in future.I wish that the company will make a new product better without problems that i said above of my review.
3,Finally!,"After receiving the first one, which was obviously used, I returned it. It took a very long time to finally get the replacement, but the product itself is great for my lunch. It's a little difficult to separate the two pieces, hopefully that will get better with a little use."
2,Should Stainless Steel Rust?,"My only complaint about this tiffin is that it is supposedly constructed of stainless steel, yet after just a few months of occasional use, it has developed rust both on the outside (around the clasps) and inside (within the groove along the top of the top tier). Because of rather infrequent use, I am puzzled as to the cause. Perhaps it results from being air dried after I wash it by hand. However, I have not encountered this problem when air drying other stainless steel wares.It may be safe to continue using it, and perhaps ingesting iron oxide is not toxic, but I would rather not take that risk, and it is certainly unsightly and does not portend well for its durability."
1,Not Impressed,"I have her vegetarian cookbook and I love it. So I thought I would love this one as well, or at least like it enough to keep it. I tried a few recipes and wasn't able to eat the results. Out it goes."
3,Too many ingredients,"Although many of these recipes look good, I am put off by the LONG lists of ingredients, especially on the soups. I will try some of the recipes, but with my own editing of ingredients. Will admit I have not tried anything yet..."
5,Man Can Live by Soup Alone,"There are very few things more divine on a cold winter night than Crescent Dragonwagon's ""Blue Satin Broccoli Soup."" I have yet to be disppointed by a single recipe. Seinfeld's Soup Nazi could have learned a thing or two from reading this book. Pair it with her Rosemary Foccacia bread and you have a dinner that will impress your guests and have you crossing your fingers that there will be leftovers for tomorrow's lunch (fat chance!) Bon appetit!"
5,Idiot's Guide to Super Soups!,"I am a terrible cook, but for ten years I have astonished my wife and made some very impressive soups from the recipes in this collection. These soups are better than anything I have ever had in a restaurant (I've never been to Crescent's B&B, however). Warning - you may never be capable of opening a can of soup once your tastebuds have been altered by this cookbook. I've got to try her Veggie Cookbook!"
1,too good to be true,"Electronics does not actually sell this item. They shipped me some junk TV stand. After getting a refund, which they did with just a little prodding, they stated that they did not have this item in stock. It sounded too good to be true at this price and was."
1,Not happy,"I was so excited to get this game in, I haven't played it in like 15 years. Unfortunately it doesn't work with my computer since it's too new, that's my fault. What I don't like is that when it said it ""not find"" for something it couldn't find it led me to believe it's a fake. Normally it'll say ""not found"" and use proper English. I would love it if Ubisoft made an updated version of this game for newer computers. I used to love playing it, it's a family game actually and I really wasn't a fan of the newer Rayman games."
2,Problematic to run,Seems to be a DOS game but requires the presence of a compatible (old) version of Windows to install. Good luck finding a modern system to run it.
5,Incredible colors and action!,"Zoom City has it all...eye-popping color, fast-paced action, and wonderful onomatopoeia (sound words). My one year old wants it read over and over. An excellent book to be read out loud."
2,not a hit with my daughter,"I received this book when my daughter was about 18 months. She sat through a reading but never requested a second reading with her trademark ""Again!!!!"", which she usually utters enthusiastically after almost every other book we read together. I also didn't like the crash scene that occurred after the car was driving too fast - not the action to be imitating. For sounds, she much preferred a book like ""Mr. Brown Can Moo. Can You?"" and for pictures, she liked books with lots of children, like those in Gyo Fujikawa's books (those books have some odd text but great pictures). This book is an easy read, only a few words per page, but I rated it based on my daughter's reaction to it."
2,Is a Car Crash an Appropriate Topic?,"Clever colorful drawings and fun noises to read aloud, but as other reviewers have noted, I'm not sure I want to read this book to my son given its subject matter. Maybe I sound like an overly fretful mother, but there are so many great books out there, it might be best to forgo this one."
4,Love And Other Obsessions,"Believe me, this album takes the mind into a new stratosphere beginning with the best cut, "" Arianna "". This song in itself shows the ultimate creativity of a band that knows no boundaries when imagination and sexuality fuse into an ultimate orchestation. I turn this one track on and fell like I'm riding the mountain roads in Rio de Janeiro. My advice, have that special lady by your side for full effect of this one. You wont be disatisfied, promise."
1,Confusing............no stars,"This has been the most confusing, convoluted story that I have had the misfortune of reading. You have a female being harassed, a macho male running from the physical affections of same female but he still wants to be with her even if he's not ready to commit. I feel like I've been on an emotional roller coast _ i think i need a drink after this book! save your money"
4,Okay Read,"I would really give this a 3.5, but had to round up to 4. I thought Velma and Russ' story was crazy, but this one is driving me nuts. I'm like other reviewers and really wish there was some other love interest for Pam that would have lit a match under Drake's feet. Everything was about him vs them. I'm doing this review and have not even finished the book (92% complete), but I'm glad she put forth and effort to try to adopt a baby (hoping to learn that that was a success in the final 8% of the book)."
3,Disappointed!,"I was disappointed in this book. Whereas Once in a Lifetime and After the Loving were books I couldn't put down, it took me a long time to work through this. This was more like re-reading After the Loving but with different characters. The story line was pretty much a mirror image of what Velma and Russ went through."
5,More of the same: Great stuff,"Acoustic Alchemy have two problems: 1) They are creative composers and thoroughly accomplished musicians. 2) They are consistent in both areas. Why are these problems? Because after seven albums, audiences sometime take you for granted. ""Against the Grain"" is another great collection of great songs from these two Britons. Frankly, any Acoustic Alchemy would be well worth your money."
3,It's just as the title says--Tips,"I'm a novice photographer and was looking for something more indepth. The book has a lot of great tips, but I was wanting more basic information about how to use apertures, shutter speeds, etc... and in a portable/pocket style. I think this will be a good resource once I become more experienced in photography."
3,Outdated,"This book was written before digital cameras existed, and doesn't even mention them. There is info about slides in there! I bought it because I thought it might help me understand photography, but I am going to look elsewhere. The tips might help me more if I understood the terminology. Definitely not a good resource for beginners."
2,Its a satisfactory product for the price,"101 Essential Tips is cheap, which is good. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the material in the book is extraordinarily outdated and does not apply to those with digital non-SLR cameras which I would assume make up most camera owners. There are still a handful of general tips within the book (composition tips etc.) but they make up maybe a quarter of the information contained in the book."
2,boring,"I gave this book as a stocking stuffer this year. But when I flipped through it, it had only basic information. Nothing exciting or inspirational. boo"
2,durability is not there,"we have gone thru 4 of these, i bought them on clearance for $15-$20 and find that they all end up skipping or the color screen goes out on them. i was hoping to find another one or two cheap as i have 3 kids, with one more on the way, and have only one that is working. i have invested quite a bit of money on the pvds, i wonder if the videonow jr pvds work on the regular videonows?"
2,Buy a portable DVD Player!,"I bought this for my 6 year old after Christmas as her cousin received one and loved it. I ran all over town trying to find the PVD's (which are hard to find a good selection of). I ended up purchasing some online. By the time the PVD's arrived, the player was no longer working. We have replaced the batteries several times. On a rare occasion, it will turn on, but that is very rare. We are very disappointed with this unit. I should have listened to my husband and bought the DVD player!"
4,My three year old loves it!,"I bought one for my 5 and 3 year old for Christmas. My husband was unsure, but I bought it anyway. It turns out my 3 yr old loves it! He's very active, but he'll sit quietly and watch a video. We haven't had any problems. The screen will go blank while sound plays BUT that means the batteries need replacing - something we have had to do several times because my son loves to watch it. I did buy a car adaptor, so he can watch longer on trips.The selection of PVD's are good. I love that there is Jeff Corwin and shark week. I hope they come out with more educational ones likes these. The only question I have is if the VideoNow Jr. PVD's play with this version.Great item!"
4,video now color,video now is very cool. it has ggod graphics and exellent color . you can talke it with u wherever you go
2,Enjoyable for kids but not very reliable,"Each of my three kids received one of these players for Christmas and love them. I think they are pretty cool myself but have a major gripe with the operation of this toy. We had to exchange one of the three right after Christmas because the players video screen would not work some of the time even though the sound was still playing from the disc. The new one seems to operate OK (so far!!) but now one of the other two players my kids received is now acting just like the first one and we have to exchange this one. I'm going to put in a complaint with Hasbro and see if they can't ship these units with a better failure rate. My kids absolutely love them but if they don't operate properly, WELL........? You dedcide!"
1,Dissapointed After Christmas,"My six year old daughter was overjoyed to recieve this toy on Christmas morning, and for four days she played with it constantly. Yesterday evening, however, it ceased to work. We tried changing the batteries, but all we have is a blue screen. She almost cried when she realized that it didn't work anymore...save your money and buy a portable dvd player that can play regular DVD's."
3,So-So,"The stories in this collection are hit or miss; the book's author, Carol Queen, has a tale that I found to be fascinating. I must gratefully say that the author's collection of stories won't be found in Penthouse Forum. Whew! The book does come with a DVD which may not play on all machines; don't let this stop anyone from exploring this book."
2,"Blurb was misleading, in my opinion","Far too many girl-on-girl stories, which interest me not at all. I would not have bought this book had I known."
3,Kinda Weak,"I found that while this book covered the aspects of BDSM very well,it did lack an erotic sense.What I mean is it seemed well versed at the tecnical side,but missed that certain something to cause a rise in the imagination"
3,LED Display is too dim,"As mentioned by other reviewers, the LED elements are far too dim to be easily viewed in a lighted room. Sony should have added a automatic or manual brightness control for the LEDs."
4,Sony ICF-C218 Automatic Time Set Clock Radio,"This is an especially nice radio for the money. Easy to set the time. If you press the alarm button when it goes off it automaticlly resets the alarm for the same time next day. This is great except for weekends. If you want to turn the alarm completely off, the control to do that is rather small. All that said, I would recommend this radio."
4,Another great Sony product,Ease if use; highly legible and bright display. I like the fact (unlike my old clock radio) that you don't have to press a button to turn on a backlight to see the time when it's dark.
4,soo soo,"Well it's an alarm clock, it does what it's suppose to, but I wish it would remember when it's the weekend."
5,Sony Automatic Clock,"I needed new bedroom clocks. I had purchased this clock in a ""Big Box Store"", then found it on Amazon cheaper..and with free shipping! I ordered two more and find it very interesting that when the clock is plugged in, the time is already correct! I have told several friends about this clock..it's compact, but can do anything and everything I need a bedside clock to do, other than play CD's..which I don't need. I highly recommend this clock..and I recommend it come from Amazon!"
4,"Nifty, Cheap, But One Flaw","This thing needs a dimmer! For the first week it was very bright. Suddenly, I went to turn the radio on one night and the display dimmed permanently! There is no dimmer switch at all. I was very disappointed. At night it's easy to see the display, but it is very dim during the day; I have to lean over to read it - pretty annoying. Hey, eleven bucks... Whatever!"
4,Economical Alarm Clock,Wanted an economical alarm clock and this one had all the desired features I was looking for. Has proved to be easy to use and has a much better alarm sound than my old alarm clock.
4,Basic that is what I need,"This is a basic radio alarm clock. Easy to use, good sound quality. The green light is a bit too strong at night that I have to move it away. Overall, it is good enough for me in my bedroom."
5,Amazing for the price!,I paid $11 for this alarm clock and that included the shipping. This is a great product for that price. This alarm clock blows away my old alarm clock. This alarm clock has big numbers and it is easy to set the alarm. Great product!
1,Way too complicated setup,"Setting the time on this unit is utterly baffling if you do not have a manual. It should be simple to set the time on such a device by looking at the controls. This clock is WAAAY too complicated. It has time zone settings, but you have no idea what these are or how they relate to the set time without a manual. How many seconds do you have to hold a button before it performs the function it is labeled for? Check the manual. Don't have one? Too bad. This machine is a disaster. Set it once when it is new and pray you don't ever have to re-set."
2,Bad LCD Display,I don't know if it's my particular unit but I have a hard time seeing the LCD readout when there's too much sunlight in my room. Only when its night time that I can see it and it's not that good. I hope it's only my unit but now I feel hesitant about buying another Sony clock.
3,"Alarm ""beeps"", doesn't ""buzz"" and it's not loud enough","I bought this to replace a toy-ish ""Spongebob"" clock radio which my son has outgrown. I could live with the fact that the radio sound quality is worse than the Spongebob unit. And the fine tuning of the Sony radio does seem better. But the Sony said that it was a BUZZER/radio alarm, but it's actually a beep, and a rather quiet one at that, whose volume cannot be raised. You can raise the volume if the alarm is set to RADIO, but if you're accustomed to falling asleep with the radio on, you're not going to wake up to the sound of the radio playing. The Spongebob BUZZER was good and loud, which is a must-have for waking up on school mornings. The Sony is nice looking and easy to use, but without a good, loud buzzer, it's of no use to me, and I'm afraid it's going to have to go back. (I wanted to change my rating from 3 to 2, but I can't . . .)"
1,cannot change time,It was fine until the time change...it is absolutely impossible to change the time...I thought it was automatic....not so...ready for trash....directions do not compute!!!!!
2,Did Not Auto-set Time,"I got this clock because I was looking for a clock that auto-set the exact time as soon as you plugged it in. We have one already and really like it. When I got this one I plugged it in and it started blinking 12:00. I had to read the directions on how to set the time, date, month, year and alarm. It is suppose to have a built in lithium back up battery. I unplugged it after setting the time and then plugged it back in. It did show the correct time. I feel that calling this an Auto Time Set Clock is misleading. There was no Amazon shipping receipt in the box (this was a first for me after always getting a packing/return slip in every package I have ever received). The only thing I like about the clock is that the display is green and not bright so it does not bother me when trying to sleep. I am keeping it because I do not want to go to the trouble to return it."
3,this is just ok,"I got this clock for my daughter but she has a hard time setting it ,when she sets it it goes off on the wrong times and i tried to set it and it does the same thing as my daughter has trouble with it goes off at the wrong times not pleased"
2,Clocks Off By 14 Minutes Even With Autoset,"We own two of these clocks. Purchased one, then another at another place, so most likely not from the same batch. When we got the first one, automatic time set worked, though it set the clock two minutes fast. Second clock did the same thing. Over the course of about three years, these clocks have set and reset themselves when we go into and out of daylight savings time. HOWEVER the error has increased over the years from two minutes fast to now where they are FOURTEEN MINUTES FAST. Ridiculous. If we only had one, I'd suspect we had a defective clock, but one came from Amazon, and the other from a national department store. This would make me suspect a design flaw, but others don't seem to be having this problem. It's confusing."
4,Nice alarm clock,"Works well. However, it came with empty back-up battery, so the time was not preset and had to be set manually. I bought a new battery."
3,Not bad,"It's not a bad clock radio. I found about it runs 2 minutes fast and also it gives off a mildly annoying interference hum probably about 3-4 times a day, though, it only lasts a matter of seconds."
5,For $12??? Well worth it!!!,I don't use this product of its alarm. I bought this because I hate turning on the lights just to look at my wall clock in the middle of the night. I set this atop my nightstand and it is really clear. You can tell time from afar. And for $12??? This is a great buy.
2,"Not really automatic time set, and now buzzing","I purchased this clock because it was listed as ""Automatic Time Set"", and thought incorrectly that this unit was able to pick up the NIST time broadcast on WWV from Colorado, otherwise popularly known as an Atomic Clock.But, it is not an Atomic Clock. It is factory preset to the correct time and has an internal 3V battery which keeps this time from factory to your home. But, it does not automatically adjust itself to the correct time as an Atomic Clock will......This clock is fine otherwise, a good price, but I think it's misleading to call this an ""automatic time set"" clock.UPDATE 9/13/2010 This clock has now been buzzing quite frequently, for short periods of time, but also in the middle of the night too. It's really annoying. There are many well thought out functions on this phone, but its a shame that after just over a year, we may need to throw this away. Going to try Sony support to see if they'll help, but we'll see!"
2,Worked great for about 6 months,"This clock worked fine until I had to adjust for DST in March 09. The clock would not set for any minute setting except 0-30. Although it wasn't very expensive, should have lasted longer than that."
4,"Works Well, but a Little Large","This alarm clock does what I need it to do. I like it, but I can't say I love it or that it deserves 5 stars. This thing is huge. I'm not sure why this is as big as it is, but it takes up a lot of space on the nightstand. There are a few cool features, including a battery back up and auto daylight savings time adjustments. Read the item description and you'll get a good idea of what your getting. It's nothing flashy, but all I needed was a bedside alarm, and that's what I got. I only wish it were more compact."
1,FRADULENT DECEPTION.. AMAZON AND SONY SHOULD BE ASHAMED,"I just received the clock radio that states ""AUTOMATIC TIME SET"". I have atomic clocks and watches in my house. When they lose juice a radio frequency resets the time. THAT IS AUTOMATIC.WHAT THIS IS is just a plain old clock radio, set at the factory for eastern time with a battery backup.If you miss the warning that the battery is weak, and lost it, well you set the time manually. NOTHING AUTOMATIC ABOUT IT.This is truly deceptive. Sony and Amazon should be ashamed as it is false advertising. It should state ""PRESET TIME"" maintained by a battery.I am having surgery Wednesday and do not have the time to ship this back and unfortunately need it. Now I will go order an ATOMIC CLOCK RADIO and burn this one after my surgery. I will never purchase any SonySony ICF-C218 Automatic Time Set Clock Radio (Black)product again and after hundreds of purchases from AMAZON am thinking about other options..I AM FURIOUS and feel lied to and cheated."
1,Clock not working,"When I received this item, back up battery was dead. Therefore the whole memory and all the programs were erased. I could have bought the battery and set up the unit manually but that would have defeated the purpose. I can imagine this clock was sitting in the warehouse for a long time and battery went dead. I suggest that seller should test the product before shipping it and spare his customers disappointment."
2,noisy,"I don't like it. It makes a strange noise that kept me awake. I would not recommend this product because of this, otherwise it was ok."
1,Could never get correct time set,"So there is NO place to manually set the time on this thing. Apparently the atomic clock is supposed to set itself. Well, almost a week later, and the thing is completely on a random time. Wasn't even worth returning it to Amazon as I had already thrown away the box and manuals. Tax donation to Salvation Army is where it ended up."
1,The worst clock I have ever bought,"I know someone is going to disagree with me, but this is the worst clock I ever spent five dollars on. Now I know why it was so cheap. It is impossible to set the time without instructions, and the instructions are in tiny print. The ""automatic time set"" feature only means that it was set at the factory. It does not set itself. I could tolerate that intentionally misleading phrase if they had not made this clock so anti-intuitive to use. Any clock that requires an instruction manual to operate is, in my opinion, not worth buying. I won't ever buy another Sony clock, that's for sure!"
3,Good but misleading description,"The time isnt automatic as described. Its factory preset.Once the battery dies, it loses correct time and you wil haved to reset."
1,Not what i expected.,"I have two big complaints that caused me to return this clock. First it is very bright. So bright in fact that I can read by it in the dark. And second, in no stretch of the term is this clock automatic time. If you read the fine print it says that their definition of automatic time is it is set at the factory and all you have to do is set you time zone. So in my case some monkey set my clock 20 minutes fast. Be warned this clock it not automatic, you must set it yourself."
3,Nothing special...,"This is a simple, basic clock radio. The preset time feature is OK, but unnecessary. My main problem is that, when I was searching Amazon for clock radios that automatically received the time signal from the atomic clock in Colorado, this radio came up. I should have read the description more carefully, and should have known that, for this price, Sony would not give us a clock radio that sets itself to the atomic clock. As is, set by the factory, the time was 45 seconds off. Caveat emptor!"
3,Disappointing reception and tinny sound,"I've loved all my other Sony radios, even the cheap ones - they have amazing sound for their size and stunningly clear reception. So I went Sony with this one, but I'm sending it back. The reception and sound are sub par - I can't get the couple of stations I bought it for. True, it's only $11, but based on my other Sony radios I was hoping for more."
3,it's off,"This does everything you'd want a clock radio to do except tell accurate time. It's as easy as pie to set up, and the features are terrific. Set it (once), and forget it, as Ron Popiel would say. I've had this for a few months and it was a minute off until my first power loss, now it's two minutes off, with no way to manually correct it. If you don't need accurate time, this is the best bang for the buck you can get."
4,Not more than average,Did not exceed the expectation.It does what it is supposed to do but some button sizes are odd.Design can improve.
1,Pain in the everything,"It takes a long time to figure out how to set the clock (push button A 7 times for 4 seconds each, then turn it over, shake it, and start over is an approximation of the instructions), and then the time is lost within days. The clock does not set itself automatically. No way. Not once. We have resorted to just adding 45 minutes to the time shown. How convenient."
3,Radio sucks / clock works great,"I like the fact that the time stays ontime when power goes out but didnt know that time # to put it on, it didn't have instructions.The radio if you decide to use at work like I did, no good it might last for a good month then after a while it get static, you adjust it again it works once you move your hand from there static again, you hand is the ground it needs to give it a good sound. Weird, so better off with a digital radio and not a tuner radio with no antenna."
5,Great alarm clock,My 8 YO son loves the fact that this doesn't wake him up in the morning. Perhaps he should turn the volume up on the alarm...He loves the black case and the big numbers.Nice little alarm clock for a good price.
4,perfect for the money!,"I stormed the shops for a cheap and good quality table watch but everything was way too expensive for the task. We needed a table clock for the living room but we didn't want to spend that much, 11 something is just right for this product. Really good quality, can't go wrong with it."
4,Great value,"I got one of these about a month ago. It's as advertised, small, inexpensive, good looking, with easy to read numbers. Everything worked as it should, although some of the FM stations with weaker signals don't come as clean and strong as I'd like. But that's because the unit itself is very small and the internal antenna is smaller. I also would like the alarm buzzer to be louder, but I just set it for the radio and make that a bit louder. But all things considered, it's an excellent value for the price. I bought a refurbished one here from one of Amazon's merchants, which made the price even lower."
3,"Doesn't keep ""accurate"" time!!!","For the price, I can't complain but...Advertised as an ""Automatic Time Set"" clock radio, I half way expected...no fully EXPECTED it to automatically keep CORRECT time!It doesn't.The telephone co. stopped it's ""time"" service, so we bought a Sharp portable automatic clock for the office does pick up the correct time from a radio (cell phone?) signal that matches the computer and cell phones auto set clock time.The Sony is always 1.5 to 2 minutes behind the other three in house references.It never drifts much farther off than 1-2 minutes and I doubt that the couple of minutes difference in the alarm in the morning will be noticed, but still -- WTF!!Maybe this is why this thing's so inexpensive?..."
2,Annoying!,"Functionally this clock radio is fine. Time/alarm are easy to set. Alarm reset is great as it is basically automatic. On the flip side, I had to make a cover for the front because the time displays way too bright. You cannot adjust the snooze function to less than 10 minutes, and the snooze bar/reset are too easy to hit incorrectly, hence, you can turn off the alarm instead of snoozing.Actually I hate it but I paid for it and will just have to use it till I find another I like better."
5,Excellent alarm clock,"I like this clock; all the controls are very intuitive, and it seems very well designed. I only wish it had red LEDs instead of green, so it wasn't quite as bright at night, but I couldn't find anything in red. It's hard to find a decent, inexpensive alarm clock, and this is the best I've found so far."
1,Automatic time set doesn't work,The automatic time set does not work. That is the only reason I bought it. After one year the clock is now 2 minutes ahead.
1,Deceptive Advertising,"It's a fine clock, I guess, but not at all what I wanted. Caveat Emptor! ""Automatic Time Set"" does _NOT_ mean that this is an atomic clock! Only that the time is set at the factory and they hope the battery lasts long enough to keep it correct until it is unpacked. I specifically purchased this for my non-technical parents who live 5500 miles away and was very embarrassed when they told me it didn't do what I thought it did.A search for ""Atomic Clock Radio"" returns this item (along with several more Sony products which may have the same issue). Amazon, please fix this!Amazon, please rename this product or update the description! A large warning label would not be a bad idea. ""WARNING: Not an Atomic Automatically Set Device"""
4,product works fine but doesnt look cool,"Very simple to operate. Has a backup battery so you dont have to reset your clock after a power outage which is really cool! I am not sure I like the design of this thing hence the four stars. Build quality is not bad but it looks kinda cheap from a distance. Does it have to look like this?? But anyways, ok for the guest bedroom I guess."
3,If your looking for a radio that is nice and clear this is not your item,"The digits are nice and big and all around I guess it gets the job done but if your looking for a radio that is a pleaser to listen to meaning does not have blurry sounds then this is not the alarm clock you would enjoy, if I was buying another alarm clock now i would not buy this one, but I can't either say that it's a peace of junk it's ok and gets the job done nothing more then that."
4,Nice compact alarm radio.,"I like this little alarm clock/radio. The one I was using was large and heavy and this one sits on the edge of my bedside table with lots of room to spare for my glasses, a glass of water and a small lamp. The clock numbers are large enough to see at night and I don't have much vision without my glasses, so that's a very good thing. The sound on the radio is quite good for such an inexpensive box of plastic. In order to set the alarm you have to choose the time on a little flipper switch on the top right of the radio and then turn the alarm on by moving a little selector switch. You can choose, Off, Radio, or Alarm. I've had this unit for a month and so far it keeps accurate time, the snooze feature works well (I love that you can set it for the time you want), and the alarm feature is dependable. I especially like that it's light weight and small."
5,Fantastic buy and superb quality for the price!,"I still can't believe the low price. I bought 3 other alarms before this one and ended up returning all because of overly bright display or bone jarring alarm sound. This is a well designed product by Sony. Some said time was off and they couldn't adjust, well the instructions clearly show how to fix that. I expected the radio to sound like tin cans and full of static. Instead It was clear and had good sound.If you have any problems with this alarm clock radio it's either defective, you haven't read the instructions or your expectations are too high for ten bucks."
4,Great clock - automatic time set - good alarm,I really like this clock - we have two - I use one in the master bedroom as my main clock/alarm and one in the spare room for guests.Pros:- Easy to set up - time and alarm setting are a breeze.- keeps excellent time - within a couple of minutes per year.- Automatically changes time when DST occurs. don't need to worry about forgetting to change the clocks. you can turn off this feature if you live in an area that doesn't change.- large LED display - easy to read even when sleepy ;)- I like the green display - doesn't throw off too much light - easy on the eyes.Cons:- It's fairly large - I NEVER use the radio function - not really sure why they still make these with radio.- turning off the alarm is accomplished with a rotating switch. On rare occasions it's possible to only rotate it part way - this can cause the alarm to fail to disengage (typically only occurs when user is extra-sleepy).Overall I like it a great deal.Hope that helps.
2,Display definitely an issue,The clock is the right price - but its useless to me because we cant see it during the daylight hours. We are looking for another with a brightness control.
3,Could be better,"The clock keeps good time and it's easy to set. However, the display is not adequate for me. The numbers are large but they are too thin and not bright enough in daylight. Otherwise, it's okay."
4,Good simple Radio Alarm Clock,"Work like it suppose to, simple clock radio. The functions are easily define by all the button and knob. Would been better if it had a digital tuner."
3,Replacement Radio Alrm Clock,I bought this Sony radio alarm clock to replace a Timex I had for 16 years- it has way better sound and reception than the old Timex. One feature I miss from the Timex is that the radio played for 2 hours after sounding as the alarm- this Sony plays for an hour. The Timex was easier to set time with push buttons on top but once I got used to the + and - buttons it was OK- there's much more prep work with this clock that's necessary before you can set the alarm. Overall I'm satisfied with the quality and value and am keeping it.
3,GOOD DEAL,"For the most part, I am pleased with this clock radio. Compared to the clock radio that I was using, this Sony is far superior. The clarity of the music is wonderful and compared to my old clock radio, the brightness of the digital numbers is just right in a dark room. I have only two complaints. First of all, and maybe it is just my unit, but the volume control doesn't seem to move very easily. That makes it difficult to adjust the volume in small increments. Either it gets too loud or I can't hear it at all. Secondly, it would be easier to operate if some of the buttons, i.e. off/on, etc., were in the front of the unit and not on top. Trying to located the buttons when you are half asleep or in a dark room, is sometimes a challenge."
4,Use with ease,My alarm clock was loud and old. This clock is compact and the alarm is pleasant sounding when it goes off (if you can believe that). Easy to set and very reliable.
5,Excellent Prodcut,"Just Perfect! Easy to use, easy to program, and small, but very useful!!! I'm happy with it.! Great product.!!!"
3,Simple clock radio,"This is what I was looking for: a basic clock radio. The auto setting clock is very easy to use. It uses a coin-type lithium cell as a backup for the clock during power outages. Sound is adequate (small speaker). My only complaint is that the clock display is not very bright. This can be good if it's next to you bed, but a little hard to see across a lighted room."
3,"Inexpensive And Good, Not Great","The ICF-C318 I bought at the same time is great, the C218 is ok and probably would have been better appreciated had I not gotten a C318 at the same time. This is still a right good value in a radio alarm clock but if you have a few dollars more go with the C318 is my suggestion."
1,Sony ICF-218 Clock Radio,"First the good: Nice design; small size fits anywhere but isn't too small to compromise usability. Easy to use, great control layout.The bad: Poor sound quality, but the worst offense is that this clock radio emits a clearly audible hum that comes through the speaker as long as the unit is plugged in. This hum can be heard from 2 - 3 feet away. Thinking my first unit was defective, I exchanged it and found the next one was identical. I am sure this isn't a defect but rather very cheap components and poor component layout on the circuit board. It sounds like the speaker is resonating to the 60Hz hum of this clock radio's transformer, which is inside the unit. The noise is a deal breaker for this Sony and renders it unusable."
4,my aunt needed a clock,"my aunt had a gift card and 1st saw socks but really needed a clock, i told her to buy the clock & i would buy the socks. she's happy with her purchase"
4,Good basic alarm clock,"This is a very sound, basic alarm clock. The one and only complaint I have is that the light is fairly bright at night. I have the face turned away from my bed, and that worked fine for me. The alarm sets very easily, turns on and off with ease, the sleep is in a good position and easy to hit for a few minutes of extra sleep."
4,Sony Alarm Clock,"It does what it intends to do. The alarm feature is a little weak--hard to tell if it is on, hard to get the flimsy ""on-off"" button in the exact right spot. That said, I own three of them, and they all work flawlessly. For the money, they are a great value. Time is easy to read, they set themselves (time, not alarm), and they can tune in all major radio stations around me."
2,"Good product, bad design","Alarm choice button is way to flimsy. The difference between waking up to radio or loud beep is 0.003mm. The know you need to turn to select between those 2 options is very flimsy and weak; it usually takes me some time to make sure I selected radio instead of buzzer. Very poor design.All buttons make a really loud plastic click noise that is very annoying. To view your alarm set time, you have to click on the lever that changes that same time. Very annoying.Yes cheap pricewise, but cheap designwise."
1,Nonfunctional within days,"I bought this clock to replace a similar clock for a guest room. The old clock (different manufacturer and model) had become unreadable over time as individual parts of the display numbers stopped working. When this clock arrived, I disposed of the old one, plugged the new one in, and it set itself to the correct time immediately as expected. Within a few days, though, the numbers became unreadable. The clock was cheap enough that I don't consider it worth my time to attempt a return (and anyway, I foolishly disposed of the packaging immediately after receiving it), so I will simply throw it away and buy a different model. Very annoying."
2,Not Worth The Bother,"I've had this clock now for two years, and it has been a problem the whole time. I originally bought it because my home was being fixed up for sale and my power was consistently being turned on and off, requiring constant re-sets of almost all my electrical appliances. Nonetheless, the LCD Display is way too dim to see in normal daylight. Atomic clock started out fine but within weeks started to run fast. Fixing time manually is far more complicated than it should be. The radio is fine, and the alarm is loud enough to wake me (I am a light sleeper though) but, again, setting the alarm is a headache. All in all, a waste of time and money."
1,Horrible FM/AM reception,"I bought this radio at Fry's Electronics, a store where all its employees where white shirts and ties and act as if they are electronics gurus. They know nothing! The radio reception on this Sony clock/radio is beyond weak. One would need to be directly underneath the signal tower to get the radio to tune into a station."
2,"Rocker switch can't be cleaned, eventually becomes clogged with dust.","This was a great clock radio while it still worked. The little rocker switch for setting the alarm time accumulated dust and dirt, and due to the way it's designed, this switch is next to impossible to clean out. It became more and more finicky until finally it didn't register any input at all.When it worked, it also had the annoying habit of overshooting whatever time you were aiming at when trying to set the alarm."
1,Can't easily see the time,"If it wasn't for a display that is too dim, this clock radio would be a good one. I looked on the clock radio itself and in the instructions and couldn't find a way to make the display brighter. Currently I have to put this clock under my desk to see the display in order to set the alarm. I would not buy this clock radio a second time around and am thinking about buying a different clock radio to replace this one. The older Sony ""dream machine"" clock radio had a brighter display and was a good one, so I bought this newer one thinking it would be good also. Too bad the newer model is worse than the older model."
2,Not a good clock,"Tiny buttons and switches make this clock hard to use. Trying to find the switch to turn off the alarm in the dark is a major pain. The 10 minutes snooze is the best feature, press once for 10, twice for 20 minutes, etc. However, after some time, my clock does not adjust the time which is now off by 10 minutes. The automatic daylight savings is wrong and adjusted itself in the middle of the summer making me late for work one day."
2,Refurbished atomic clock doesn't work.,I ordered the refurbished clock because I thought I would be getting the same product for a bargain price. I ordered two and neither of them are able to set their time automatically with the atomic portion. I haven't returned them as of yet because of the hassle of repackaging and shipping costs. So I just use them like regular standard radio alarm clocks and they work fine for that except the alarm on-off button is tiny and requires a nimble grip. I bought the radio because of all the fantastic reviews. I am disappointed.
3,Auto-time set is wrong!,"I loved the idea of an 'auto-time set' clock, until this one started gaining time, minute by minute. Within a year it has become 16 minutes fast. I don't keep manuals around for 'simple' equipment, so I had to look it up online. You CAN reset the time, which I have now done. Time will tell if it sticks or if it starts getting faster and faster...."
2,Could be better.,"The design and layout of the comtrols is poor. Remember, much of the time your operating the controls you're half asleep. The controls are not use friendly and makes it easy to hit the wrong buttons/switches. Everything works as stated, it's just how they work that makes it difficult to use. You get what you pay for."
1,Radio sound poor,The radio is very small and the quality of sound is poor. Found it very difficult to set time and alarm. Returned it.
3,Runs fast,"This is an automatic time clock... the trouble is it runs about 15 minutes fast. Since it is automatic, you cannot adjust it."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I ordered this to replace a Sony alarm clock that out lived it's self. Thinking ""hey my old Sony lasted a good long time"", I bought this. It is very junky. It reminds one of a toy. Does it work? Yes, but it is not the quality I expect from Sony."
2,Alarm buzzer sound is way too low to be of any use,"I should have paid more attention to some of the prior reviews before purchasing this. It is completely useless for me as an alarm clock (my primary purpose) given the buzzer sound is way too low for me to wake up. Alternate is to setup wake up via a radio function, but when the power is out, the radio won't work so there is a good chance that you would oversleep if you have an important thing to wake up early and on time. There is no way to adjust the volume of the buzzer either. I also wished it uses a commonly available battery such as AA or D instead of a button CR2032. Returning it."
3,doesn't last,"The clock is great for the price and was fine for the first year or so, but now the time is fast and I can't get it reset no matter what i do! The Sony web site says they will gladly send me a refurbished one in ""exchange"" but the $17 fee is more than i paid for the clock to begin with. I guess you get what you pay for!"
4,Variable reception depending on where you put it,"This is a nice alarm radio with buttons designed intuitively and a large display that is easy to read from far away. I put it about 1.5-2 feet away from my head and the bright display does not bother me. But the reception is variable depending on where you put it. For our local FM NPR station, it can be crystal clear at one location and very noisy with interference at another location. At the same time, my old clock radio bought at Walmart more than a decade ago has good reception everywhere. I think the problem is due to the fact that this radio does not have a separate antenna, which is a thin long wire on the back of many old radios. Anyway, once it is carefully tuned to a station with noise minimized, it is a very functional clock radio. I enjoyed it so much that I bought a second one."
4,A solid no-frills clock,"I wanted something inexpensive that performed basic clock and alarm functions and this does the job nicely. The radio is pretty weak and doesn't get especially good reception. The alarm can be set to be either a beep or radio. The clock display is bright enough to read, but it isn't so bright that it affects my ability to fall asleep (I keep it right next to my bed). There are a lot of buttons and I think they could have been arranged in a more logical order. Also there are separate buttons for setting time/date and alarm which seems really unnecessary. The snooze is in 10 minute intervals and it'll last for up to 60 minutes."
1,Off by 3 minutes and NO WAY to manually change,There is absolutely NO WAY to increment the minutes.Mine is off by three minutes and I can't update it.I pulled the plug and removed the battery... I will try again in one week.
1,Broken right out of box.,"First day: alarm does not work; included battery is dead; radio has bad reception. Also, the setup is not intuitive. If you have to look at the instructions to set up an alarm clock you're in trouble."
1,Worked for a year before breaking,The alarm clock switch used to control forward and backward movement through time. That's desirable because the minutes zoom by while you're setting the alarm. Now mine only goes backward. I'll try a different unit.
3,Pros & Cons,"Based on previous reviews, I expected it to be too bright but that was a non-issue for me. I like the ease of changing the alarm time (forward or backward) and the big button you use. What is disappointing is the small circular dial that you use to engage the alarm. I have to put the light and my glasses on to figure out whether it is on, and whether I have selected alarm or radio. It seems loose and cheesy. For me, it's the most important selection so I'm not sure why it was made so difficult to use."
5,"Alarm clocks are nearly obsolete, but this one rocks","Just picked this one up at Walgreen's, works like a charm, automatic time, easy to set, nice design. Sleek and fun for a nearly obsolete technology.... the ole ALARM CLOCK !!!"
3,Its okay,"The clock works just fine and the alarm works just fine - only problem is that it is not very loud - speaker does not turn up loud enough, nor does the alarm. I formerly had another Sony that's sound blew this one away. Wish it was louder!"
4,very good but one flaw,"Nice size numbers, better than average sound, but the auto time set had me stumped, seven minutes fast out of the box. J and R support, where I bought the unit, had to explain and I further had to look in the manual under adjusting month,year, and finally time. Not at all intuitive. Requires pressing three buttons and a toggle switch in proper order. Why make it so difficult? Minus that star works fine for a low end radio."
4,Great Auto Clock for the Price,"I love this clock because of the auto time setting feature. My wife and I both have our own in the same room. Oddly enough they had two different times by 5 minutes. Mine was fast - my wife thinks its because the clock knew I needed all the help I could get. I was easily able to change the time so that it now is correct by adjusting the exact minutes (intuitive buttons on the clock). I would give it a five star, but as most items that are this cheep, it is made of cheep components. The alarm time adjust switch on mine is losing its mind (the electronic connections are wearing out). On my wife's, the alarm dial is loosing its mind (the electronic connections are wearing out). We use hers as a guest clock sometimes and many guests have been woken up very early because the alarm switch says off, but the light says on. It is only ~$10 so I guess three years life is all one should expect."
3,DST? Why?,"The Daylight Savings Time switch is located on top of the machine, too conveniently located to other controls. It is far too easy to activate the switch when turning the alarm off in the dark; resulting in incorrect alarm times. The switch should be located in the rear of the unit. The pressing question regarding this feature is why? Do I really need a switch to change the time twice per year? Ridiculous feature!"
5,Sonn clock radio,"As with most all Sony products, this clock radio is a great value. The ease of operation is excellent. The only drawback (albeit a small one) is the small speaker. I wish it was a bit more larger. All in all, you can't beat the price or the quality."
2,Display Brightness Problem,"In our opinion, the display brightness is too dim to read during the day (or when all the room lights are on), and too bright at night. These Sony alarm clocks should have had an automatic dimmer or some way to adjust the brightness."
1,Never AGain!!,I would never buy this clock again or recommend it to anyone! It is a bit tricky trying to figure out how to set it and figure out your time zone. But the main problem is that IT RESETS ITSELF ALL THE TIME!!! Both of my children have one and both clocks do it! It'll reset which time zone you are in which then changes your time - so then your alarm goes off either too early or too late! And it also randomly resets the alarm times! My 11 year old has woke up many mornings at 5am due to this and then of course you can't go back to sleep because you can't reset the stupid alarm clock! Very frustrating. We are trashing both clocks and buying a cheaper digital alarm clock. Never again!!
1,Malfunction after 6 months,"THE ALARM STOPPED WORKING! Nothing else matters if the alarm doesn't wake you up! The bad part is that the problem is intermittent; The first time it happened I thought is was my fault for not setting it correctly. The second time I knew it wasn't my fault because I made sure the correct time was set, that I had the correct AM/PM setting, and that the alarm switch was set in the right position for alarm."
5,Great Clock,"I bought this clock because it was cheap and got good reviews on this site. It might actually be the best alarm clock I've ever owned. Granted, any clock will perform well on month into use, but it has great features. My favorite is that it doesn't have that loud, grating buzzer every other alarm clock uses. It's a mild-to-medium bell-like sounds that isn't startling, but still wakes me up.The only short-coming is that it doesn't have two alarms. I've found that useful on my previous alarm clocks."
4,A good product for the price.,Buttons are not that sturdy and a bit loose. Clear display both during daytime and nighttime. Radio lacks the stereo quality but for the price OK.
5,Simple to use,This was the easiest alarm clock I have ever used. The only thing I am not sure of is the button battery backup. I'll have to wait and see how long that lasts if the power goes off.
4,Good Choice!!!,"Its a nice alarm Clock, easy to read during night, easy to set up, good choice. thanks"
3,display is too bright,"I find that the display illuminates the room too brightly while I am trying to sleep. Also, the button to turn the alarm off is a bit tricky to find while you're sleepy. I'm going to move this thing to the guest room and buy something new with a dimmer."
4,"Cool, Radio, but so my Static","This could be just a personal problem, but the radio always have static. I try to place it in different places, but to no success. It still works great as a regular alarm though, just wish the radio was better. The price is great!"
3,Its not really loud,"There is defiantly some good things about this clock, it keeps track of time when the power is out, it is easy to read and to set, and its cheap. But its not very loud and often i found myself sleeping right through it."
1,Excellent Purchase for the Price,"A good clock for the price. The radio sound quality isn't so great; but I didn't expect it to be, either. It serves the purpose for which I bought it: an easy to see 'smart' alarm clock with a backup battery.I gave it four stars because it is a cheap clock; but for the price, it's more a five star.Update: I was very annoyed to find that it follows the old daylight saving time schedule, so it's worthless."
2,Will not keep correct time,"I've had this unit for a few years and it's pretty consistent. It has provided me with a good alarm that resets for the next day. The display is fine. I can read it any time of the day. My only problem with this unit is that it refuses to keep the correct time. It has been getting faster and faster. It's now about 10 minutes ahead and there's no way to change it back. Now I have to set my alarm later and every time I look at the time I have to do a little math problem in my head. If you want a clock to KEEP time rather than one that TELLS YOU what time it is, the I wouldn't suggest this one."
4,Jars Me Awake,"Sometimes I fall asleep in my lounge chair and wake up stiff and sore in the wee hours of the morning. As a result I do not get enough restful sleep. I have tried setting the alarm on my watch and my PDA, but neither are loud enough to awaken me and send me to bed.My doctor suggested I find a device to jar me awake and I searched for such a device. At first I didn't consider a radio, because I have several other excellent appliances for listening to music, and I seldom listen to the radio unless I am driving in my car. After awhile I found this Sony clock radio.This radio is easy for me to use. I set the clock radio to a station that plays loud and uncomfortable (to me) music. I set it and it always awakens me. I have to get up and cross the room to turn off the alarm.I recommend this radio. Not only is the sound quality very good, but it performs well as an alarm."
2,Too dim,This is a really poor clock. The numbers on the clock are way too dim to see. I didn't see anyway to make them brighter so during the day I would have to be standing right next to the clock to be able to tell what time it was. The actual alarm on the clock was terrible also. It wasn't loud enough so sometimes I would sleep right through. Needless to say i had to replace this clock with the Rca 2 alarm clock. Avoid this clock at all costs.
2,Sony Radio,The instructions are a waste of time. Can't set the clock and can't set the AM or PM. A very bad product.
1,gains 30+ seconds a month,"I've had this alarm clock since 2007... and I'm considering tossing it because of its flaws.The clock runs extremely fast. In two months it gains a minute at least. I'm often setting it back a couple minutes and then, before I know it, it's ahead again.You also should be warned to keep the manual close at hand. Otherwise you'll never be able to figure out how to reset it.This is a piece of Sony garbage. No wonder that once-good company is on the skids. There is no excuse for an electric clock to keep such bad time."
1,Save your money buy something else,"A real disappointment. What ""engineer"" designed this? Very difficult to set time...Tiny little markings and controls...I am planing to replace it with something that actually works"
2,"Decent, but HUGE","The piece seems decent enough, and we were all set to use it. However when we put it on the night table, it took up TONNES of space, almost half of the front area. Read the dimensions clearly before you order it! We didn't and sent it right back."
5,Guest room clock,This clock was just the item I needed for the guest room. Arrived a bit longer than what was estimated but am sure that was due to a snow storm.11/26/2011
5,Sony ICF - 218 Automatic time clock radio (black),I have had several alarm clocks over the years and I find this the easiest to operate by far than any I have previously owned. I love this instrument and it heightens my respect for Sony products.
1,Most intermittent clock ever made,"Perhaps I received a bad unit, but this clock is pretty awful. There's a scene in the new Spiderman movie where he smashes it when it goes off, and I can't help but feel a similar emotion to this thing. The worst thing about this clock is that the auto time sync doesn't have a manual override. I know, because mine has progressed from being 5 minutes fast, now up to 10 minutes fast. I can't trust this clock to be an alarm clock because I don't know if it will wake me up at the appropriate time. If I had to leave at 9 to avoid the traffic that clears out at 9:15, then this clock sure wouldn't help. I really don't like this clock at all, buy something else."
2,Poor Display,"My problem with this unit is that there is no way to control the brightness of the LED display. Actually, there is but it doesn't work all the time. My son hit the Snooze button one day and it dimmed the display to the point that during the daytime, you cannot see the time unless you're pretty close to it. I tried to hit that button again and again to switch the brightness but it didn't work. I checked the manual and there isn't any mention of this at all. I've tried several more times and it finally worked and the display was bright again. Then, one morning, I hit the snooze button twice by mistake and it dimmed the display again. I cannot get it back anymore and I'm extremely frustrated with it. It obviously has some sort of control over the brightness but it is not explained and does not work all the time. I'm looking for a new alarm clock."
5,great thank u,bought this for my husband he needed a alarm clock. and it better then trowing water on him to get him up. he likes it thank u.
5,Can't Beat This Clock!,"Buying a new alarm clock is always a challenge. I'm a sound sleeper, and I need one that is loud, and dependable goes without saying. The Sony ICF-C218 is the perfect solution. The clock itself is not too large--it doesn't take up much room on the bedside table. However, the numbers are large and easy to see. You can awake to a buzzer or the radio, perfect to pull me out of the deepest sleep. It's fast and easy to set. In short, I like it far better than my old clock. It was a great choice!"
3,"Functional, but raspy audio","Functionally this clock is fantastic. It keeps the time even during power outages and automatically updates to daylight savings time, so I have never needed to set the time on it! However the speakers are quite raspy and I sometimes end up waking up with a bit of a headache because of how bad the audio quality is :/ Oh well, you get what you pay for."
4,Very easy to use,"This is a no frills, AM/FM alarm clock. You can wake up to an alarm ""buzzer"" or the radio. This unit has sleep function, automatic Daylight Savings Time adjustment, and built-in Lithium battery backup for when the power goes out. The only thing I wish this unit had was an adjustable dimmer for the LED."
2,Makes a good night light,Clock functions ok but the display is too bright! Not worth the price of shipping to return it. Maybe I'll put it on my roof and see if it can be seen from space!
2,time set broken after 4 months,I bought this item in walmart and then found that the time function could not work after using for 4 months.
2,"Ok design, except a very poor radio","I took this Sony back, as its ability to pick up FM stations was simply terrible. And the tuning mechanisium is hard to use, also.What happened to Sony quality?JPH San Francisco"
5,Great item !!,"This is a top notch item, not like the cheap pair I had. Very sharp. A lot thicker blades, will last longer."
5,Trauma shears,I use mine in the ER to cut what's left of the clothing off of trauma patients. Mine work just fine.
1,How Aweful!,"These scissors aren't even Smith & Wesson! I ordered two pair of these scissors a several days ago and just recieved them. These scissors are the cheapest scissors I've ever seen! The plastic has ruff parts and thick burrs around the edges, especially where it was molded around the blades. I'll have to sand these things down before using them. The plastic also has buff marks all around it. Also, the rivot holding these things together is really cheap. There's scratches all over the insides of the blades as if they have been used. There is not a single brand name on the scissors. the markings are that this product is autoclavable and the inscription, ""Stainless Pakistan."" These are not even Smith & Wesson! I will never buy from BP Medical Supplies again. I don't expect Amazon to get this vendor sorted out. I hope to get a full refund from Amazon."
1,WARNING!!! THIS COMPANY DOES NOT SELL THE PRODUCT ADVERTISED!!!!,"I ordered three pairs of the advertised ""Smith & Wesson"" shears, but only received cheap imitations! This company is falsely advertising for one product, but sending you another. I notified Amazon, and the company issued me a refund with an email stating that there is a mistake in their ad and their never sold Smith & Wesson shears. They also said they would fix the mistake, but this was two months ago. DO NOT PURCHASE THESE SHEARS!!! In addition, I wouldn't recommend buying ANYTHING from this company since the obviously can't be trusted."
1,Disapointed,I'm very disapointed and feel very vexed because a never receive the product I paid for. It was purchaced on 11-22-09 but to date I have no new about it. That's a shame and makes look Amazon.com very very bad. Even if I get my stuff probably I won't buy any more through Amazon.com.
2,Just another pair of shears.....,"Just received my pair of ""Smith and Wesson"" shears and to be honest they are just a plain pair of shears. Pretty disappointing. The picture they portray is a pair of shears with Smith and Wesson stamped in the side, but my just say Pakistan like my cheap pair i currently have. I'm sure they will work well for the first week or so like so many other shears I've gone through but i would NOT buy these again, but again what do u expect for something under $10."
4,Very easy controls,The controls were very easy to understand. It took a little exploring but in the end it was so easy. The manual could be improved a little
4,A good cheap player,"A good player for it's price - you're not expecting miracles from this price range. Overall I am pleased with this player however.A gripe (naturally) is that it uses AAAA batteries and has no recharge capacity, but oh well."
1,A big disappontment,I was not happy with this DVD at all. It was too short and a waste of my money. I don't recommend it to anyone. I found Cyberitalian online and am actually learning quite a bit of Italian.
5,Great book for new parents!,"As a new parent, I spent months of anticipation before the birth of my daughter. When she suddenly appeared on the scene, my life was turned topsy-turvy! I no longer had the autonomy of my previous years. I suddenly was under the control of my ""little bundle of joy"". Way of the Baby describes in detail how my little one became so powerful. The book combines philosophical insight and self-parody in a way that kept me smiling all the while. I strongly recommend this book for the new parents that are trying to make sense of their new ""master""... better yet, buy for the expectant parents so they might ease into their new roles!"
5,The title says it all,"This book gives you all the tools you need to attain true fitness as an ongoing lifestyle. The author is immensely qualified and debunks many myths and frauds in the worlds of nutrition, exercise and dieting.The chapters dealing with body mechanics and posture are beyond valuation for those suffering from back pain - like myself. Following Dr. Bookspan's recommendations I have eliminated most of my chronic back pain and no longer need the heavy pain meds.Again, following the book; by making a few simple adjustments to my diet (which was already considered ""very good"" by my Dr.) and changing my mental outlook on exercise and physical activity have resulted in my being able to incorporate more ""exercise"" into a schedule that I believed had 'no room' and have begun to lose weight that had previously refused to budge!Anyone who is serious about becoming fit must buy this book!"
5,Excellent book,"Great book - just what I expected. Concise, clear and common sense suggestions about how to live your life."
5,Inside Out Fitness Hood River loves the Distance Measuring Wheel!,"This is a great measuring tool! I own Inside Out Fitness in Hood River Oregon and this baby is easy and portable which is very important to me since I travel with lots of equipment. Get it!---Rick Dant RN, ""THE"" Trainer!"
1,Not Again - PLEASE!,"Haven't they beat this horse to death yet? This group has been around for over 20 years and yet we ae still getting LAME remixes of a song that could never be topped by the ""Murder Mix"" and that came out in 1986, I believe!Pete Burns has had so much plastic surgery if you got a stick and hit his head, toys would fall out, and I believe it's finally affected his music. Lay off the surgery, Pete. You look rather pitiful, and this attempt to milk more money out of your followers is just that--a poor excuse for music. Can't you do a remix of ANOTHER DOA song. I mean, I loved it the first 2 million times I heard it, but enough already."
4,Dance,"It is a very fun cd to listen to. It can be a litte hard to understand because they sing most in portugese. But if you don't care about that it dosen't matter if you understand or not.You are gonna have very fun if you like to dance. It is also a great workout.I can strongly recommend it, I can also recommend one of their new cd that is called ""Positivo""."
2,Third-rate Brazilian bubblegum pop,"Eh.I love Brazilian bubblegum pop/dance music. Manufactured disco pop groups like E O Tchan or Terra Samba? I can't get enough! Axé Bahia? They're OK. Second rate dancers performing third rate material with fourth rate voices. This is a group of young, reasonably attractive Brazilians, put together and packaged for the Spanish-language Latin American market. Apparently, os Brasileiros keep the best for themselves and export only third rate cheese.The centerpiece track -- ""Beijo Na Boca"" -- is too heavy on generic American teen hip hop. It's not Brazilian enough! And the videos included on the DVD disc aren't that entertaining. These kids, packaged together for their undeniable physical attractiveness, aren't even as good-looking as the general Brazilian population you see on the beaches of Copacabana, Ipanema, and Barra de Tijuca.Tudo bem? No."
5,Practical and necessary insight for everyone!,"Nick Synko packages his practical wisdom and insights into the 21st Century workplace with terms, illustrations, and examples that are digestible for children but also relevant to senior managers. For young readers, Future@Work is a perfect introduction to the mindset and skills required to thrive in business and in life. For people already exploring the relationship between their personal identity and their vocation, this is an concise refresher with new thought starters. For teams of any organization, this is a foundation for improving individual and group fulfillment and results. This is one of the best ""reading time-to-value"" investments you can make."
5,One of the most exquisite performances of all time,"I would like to say a word or two about this legendary performance of Schubert's piano trio no. 1 in B Flat. To hear it is to be transported into another world. The musicianship is not fashionable today, with tremolo and warbling, but there is miraculously no flaw in this sound of sheer beauty. I have listened to this recording for 35 years and never tired of it. Casals, Cortot, and Thibaud capture Schubert's intricate, passionate yet playful conception, with artistic independence and near perfect ensemble work. The other famous performance by Rubinstein, Heifitz, and Piatigorski, for all its technique, does not approach the earlier ""mariage a trois."" Heifitz as usual is sharp and gypsyish, but the earlier trio soars as a group, lifting the soul. Yes, I am enthusiastic. This recording has enriched my life immeasurably, and despite its lacy velvet-and-roses quality I recommend it for its unforgettable transcendental power."
5,Duct Tape and an Elastic band,"This book is outstanding. My dad has used it every night for as long as I can remember. I am here today to try and replace it with a newer maybe more modern version, for ours is a bit lets say, ""weathered"". The spine has been taped three times. Right now it is being held together with an elastic band. The pages are torn and yellow and smell of oregano and allspice. I am trying to acquire another one for father's day, sadly it is out of print. I hope it's replacement has not changed since 1984. I recommend this book (if you can get your hands on one) to every cuisiniere. Wish me luck."
4,The Best...All Around,"This one is awesome for FW use. The difference between FW and USB 2.0 can be researched...but its absolutely undeniable that FW kills USB when you work with large files, so this drive is absolutely necessary for me. I love the looks of it. It keeps the drive cool even without a fan. The retractable legs are neat and work great. The light is very bright and helps to keep me from leaving it on too long. The only thing I wish it did was to turn off and on with the computer. But the on/off switch isn't hard to get handle...so this isn't a huge issue. Its a great enclosure, and the drive is secure. Lots of cables as mentioned in the other review, really helps out. Its an awesome enclosure and my seagate 500gb works flawlessly every time I power it up."
1,Unreliable,"The Firewire interface failed upon second use.I returned it, & bought a 3rd Vantec NexStar 3.All 3 of my NexStars perform without a hitch."
5,I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BOOK!!!,"I found it very hard to close this book! I was riveted to Chief Mankiller's every word and finished her book still wanting more. Her knowledge of Cherokee history and legend is vast and taught me many things I never knew. Also, her strength and enduring spirit is inspiring to me as a Cherokee. She succeeded, through her own life story, in instilling a new sense of pride in me that has made me become more involved in keeping native american culture alive and well. After reading her book I truly felt proud to be Cherokee. She should be an inspiration to us all. Highly recommended reading!"
3,Little Pony,"It is something which I thougth would be cute, but there is not much to do with. My daughter loves the little ponies series and has several sets.but this one doesn't make much sense. The butterflies are cute and that is what there is to say to it. It stand on her dresser and getting not much played with. Live and learn. not always do you get a good deal for your money. She was and still is happy"
5,Classic Crofts,"One of Crofts's most highly praised works, which lives up to its reputation with ease. A miser and his servants are burnt to death in Yorkshire; despite the verdict of accident, murder is suggested by the fact that the bank notes, which should have perished in the fire, are still in circulation. French, disguised as an insurance investigator, travels north, and from there to France and Scotland. Despite a great deal of travelling, his plodding detection is genuinely interesting, and, although he only solves the crime a minute before he arrests the murderer, he comes across as more of a thinker than in later tales. The red herrings to which he applies his mind are as fresh as the writing and characterisation; and, although the reader will not be unduly surprised by the final revelation, he will marvel at the intricacy of a highly ingenious plot, with a nice bit of body-snatching for extra merit."
1,used only a few times before it broke,"I bought yhis when it first came out, only used a few times. It stayed in back of service van, used for job sites, the last time I went to use it the reflector behind the bulb had flaked off & the main pc control had shorted out. The cost of repair was the same cost to buy another. Expensive light, expensive lesson. I wouldn't buy it again unless it was under $50.00 Like most Dewalt tools Made in China."
5,Better than expected !,"This is a lot bigger than i thought it would be. The light output is great and came in handy painting a large ceiling, to avoid missing any areas. Wet paint really shines off this light and you can carry a wet edge through the project. Also, during a service breaker panel change over, with no power available for a time, this light also proves its worth. Charging TWO batteries at once is a PLUS as well ! If you like Dewalt, you will LOVE this work light station !!"
4,transformer charger,"Just in time for the new move Transformers, I bought my own. This one transforms from a dual battery charger with built in outlet into a nifty worklight that's pretty bright. The unit itself is kind of bulky but it does accomplish multiple functions very well. If I had to, I'd buy this again."
3,It's ok,"I purchased this light for my husband for Fathers day. We LOVE DeWalt & we own several different tools and lights from them. I wanted to surprise him with this ""new"", ""cool"" light. Well, he wasn't that impressed. It's kinda big and cumbersome. The light itself is great. You can toggle it in a few directions, but it obviously wont work in tight spaces. The best part of this light is the fact that you can re-charge batteries on it. We already have 2 separate chargers, so 2 more is a plus when we are packing our DeWalt bag with full batteries for a camping or race trip. Anyways...the product is great on lighting for big areas but the bulk is a bit annoying if not impossible for any area that is compact. Attempting to balance it on anything but a floor or counter is awkward. We find that we reach for the smaller fluorescent light much, much more often."
3,went up in a puff of smoke!,"It works well and gives a good amount of light, but the arms that hold the lamp are very short and give very little adjustment, I think they could of designed this better.This is huge, its 2' x 1' x 5"" and that makes it hard to place just anywhere, especially on a ladder.update:I plugged it in to use it and it let out a puff of smoke,still under warranty I brought it to a local Dewalt tool repair shop who looked at it and sent it back to Dewaltwhere its been for 6 months and they (DeWalt) still can't fix it."
4,light,"Awsome light with the extra plugs, but I hoped that Dewalt could have found a way to let or make one of the plugs work off the two battery power."
3,Fluorescent Worklight,"I had the impression this Fluorescent Worklight was on mini-tracks and could move around like a mini-tank with a remote wire when you can't move it by back muscle. Well, just be aware, you have to lug this SOB everywhere. Eventually a concrete slab fell on it. Totalled it just like that. Built like a horse, my [blank]."
1,dewalt light,"this light is to big and cumbersome,not bright enough,cost to much,dewalt didnt do to well of a job on this one,its a piece of s**t"
5,An excellant choice,"I bought this book when it first came out. I really enjoyed reading it. The book is well written. It has a lot useful code.The author code that can be used in the real world of JAVA and XML. I liked the books section on JDOM. This book shows the differences between DOM and JDOM. Also, this book has a lot of information on SAX, DOM, JDOM, and it shows the differences when using each. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn JAVA and XML. Make sure you are an experienced developer before purchasing this book.Michael"
3,Early Days,"This novel will interest those readers who like historical romance settings, It speaks of a time when the early colonies still belonged to England. I found it interesting."
3,Slow reading not my style,"I just couldn't wrap my head around the contents enough to continue reading. I gave up about half way, moved on to another book and author."
3,lesser than the sum of its parts,"As a guitarist myself, I love both Lee and Larry's playing and agree with their approach to this CD (music over chops), but this and many of both their individual efforts just do not move me. It's just too safe and homogenized. You just want them to let down their guards and get at least a little edgy but they never do. I have bought many of both their CD's but none are still in my collection much for the same reason. I wish Larry would allow an independent producer to come in and point him in the right direction because as a truly gifted player he always seems to miss the mark when recording his own projects."
1,AVON SERVICE OVERALL,"I have never ordered anything from AVON, and this was my first time ordering ""Avon SKIN SO SOFT BUG GUARD Plus PICARIDIN Aerosol Spray"". There was a special/promotion when you buy two and you get them both for free. So I put in an order for this item. A week later I get an e-mail notifying me that the order has been cancelled. Thats ridiculous. If you put on that price than you are obligated to honor it. This is unacceptable. I am never shopping AVON again, and recommend same for you. Would you want to order something you need and then a week later notified that your not getting it? If you didn't have it in stock then there was no point advertising it in the first place, but obvisouly they had it in stock, but since they either made a mistake or were loosing too much money on the promotion, they just cancelled it all together. Bad customer business. You lost my business Avon.Dont deal with them. You'll regret it."
1,Disappointing,I am very disappointed with Avon and Amazon for cancelling my order with no explanation. I purchased this product for use on July 4th weekend instead of my usual insecticide spray because of the offering of this product put on by Amazon and Avon which would have allowed trying it for free. Many companies will offer free product for trial so this did not seem unusual when the order ended with a zero balance. My e-mail arrived 7/03/08 stating it had been cancelled. No explanation or apologies or correction with further assistance. Very poor customer service on the part of both establishments. I will be very hesitant to order anything that is needed for a specific event or time from these companies even though my previous purchases through many businesses on Amazon have arrived within a no more than a weeks time with most all purchases. Buyer beware of promotions from Avon!!
5,Unbelieveable? Where does this sense of entitlement come from?,"As for all of these reviews where people are complaining that their orders got canceled, they read about a PRICE MISTAKE on slickdeals.com, whereby if you order this product in even numbers, and go through checkout, it the total is $0.00...that's right, totally FREE with FREE SHIPPING. The mistake was caught and their orders were canceled, and now they're upset that they didn't get something for free. I put in an order and it was canceled too, but I understand. What business in the world can afford to ship thousand of items of free product? Apparently many orders did go through before the mistake was caught, because many people reported that they received their orders. But for people to whine and complain that their FREE order was canceled is ignorant and childish IMHO.[...]"
5,Avon Bug Guard & OFF lantern,"I researched products we could use without spraying DEET on ourselves. We camped in the forest in Northern Arizona. I saw the mosquitos move in around sundown. I used this OFF Lantern along with ""Avon Bug Guard"" from an AVON store on 7th and Bell in Phoenix. I couldn't smell the lantern. Maybe 1 bite per/person. Very Pleased."
5,It works!,I like this a lot better than DEET. It keeps the mosquitoes off and smells better and is less toxic. I think the pump bottles last longer though.
1,Poor Business Practice,"Extremely disappointed that a company as well known as Avon would advertise a promotion, then after receiving my order, cancel it. Does Avon not have the same obligation to honor their offerings as other reputable businesses? It is quite clear that customer satisfaction is no longer part of Avon's philosophy. This transaction made me extremely hesitant to purchase from them in the future."
1,Order cancelled with no explanation,"Like the rest, I paid for this item and then had it cancelled a week later with no explanation. This is extremely poor service from a company (AVON) who put their promotion on Amazon's website in the first place."
5,It does the job,I have experimented working in my garden both with and without spraying the Skin So Soft on my legs. The difference is pretty amazing. It works!
3,Avon,"Used this for my cat that is allergic to mosquitoes. Was the one produce my veterinary dermatologist recommend that wouldn't be toxic to him. Worked great, but he HATED being sprayed."
4,Works well.,"I used this on a recent trip, and it worked great to ward off mosquitoes. It is important to me to have a product that works, since I am allergic to mosquito bites."
2,missing lots of magnets,"The book itself is cute if you buy it new I imagine. The way we got it,it was missing a lot of magnets and this was very dissapointing"
3,Just ok,This book is not as fun to do as the Farm book. The magnets are one or two to a page and my 2 yr old gets really bored quickly. I thought that this would be a good book to teach her numbers but she just tries to take things and run. Doesn't keep her attention like the other books.
1,Not a universal Delonghi filter,"This filter did not work for my Delonghi machine. My machine takes #4 filters when they are paper, and has a wide base. This filter has a narrow base."
5,a great talent,patti austin has always been bad.her vocals are still strong after all these years.this collection showcases many of her greatest songs.she can sing any style of music.a very gifted artist.
2,Nothing special,My son is still not very interested in this book and he is now 12 months. After a few pages he is anxious for it to be over and to read a different book. I think the concept of the book is really cute and good for learning but he evidently does not find it stimulating at all.
3,Not my favorite Boynton,"I find this book, written in all capital letters, a little hard to read. Not much surprising or different in this book, which teaches the names of the body parts (including, I must admit, horns and tail). But the drawings are fun and colorful, and the length of the story is short enough to hold a young child's attention."
2,Not the Best Boynton,"We have been reading to my son since he was just a few weeks old. After a few months he already had a few books which were his favorites - one of which was Boynton's Moo, Baa, La La La. We went out and got more of her books expecting the same reaction. We weren't disappointed, except for this one. For whatever reason (we suspect it is too wordy and doesn't have the catchy rhymes like the others tend to have) our son (now 10 months old) won't let us get past the first page of this book without crawling away or closing the book shut. Our son would rather play with and be read books than play with most of his toys. This one just doesn't cut it. We recommend Opposites, Barnyard Dance, and Doggies (Doggies is annoying for adults to read, but he loves it). We'll continue to explore her books, but at least so far, this one is not the best Boynton."
5,Boynton Books are Awesome,"I love the quirkiness of these books, they are so fun and my little man loves getting these read to him and they never get old with me either since i'm wondering every time i read them where in the heck did this lady come up with this stuff!"
3,"Not my favorite Boynton, but still great for babies and toddlers","It's very short, only a few sentences per spread.It's just not very *interesting* to me. Not as funny or catchy as most of her books.But if you're trying to read to a baby or young toddler, you need all the short books you can get, and this one will fit the bill."
2,Not the Best Boynton Book,"We have all the Boynton books (Barnyard Dance, Doggies, Opposites,etc), and my 18 month old son loves all of them but this one. Whenever we sit down to read it, he pushes it away after only a page or two to reach for another book. For some reason, it just doesn't capture him like her other books do."
2,Skimpy,"Since I'm not particularly handy around the house, I had high hopes for this CD-ROM to help me as I maintain my older house. Unfortunately, this CD-ROM just scratches the surface of home repair, leaving out many scenarios I've encountered that I don't consider particularly exotic.My wife, who *is* particularly handy around the house, browsed this CD-ROM as well, and told me that some of the instructions given were more complicated than necessary."
5,Hinge of the year,"What a great hinge.Suitable for light jobs.Easy to check in using the biscuit joiner.Strong,light weight and well made.Great packaging.Comes complete with screws and driver bit."
5,"A&E release is PERFECT,PRINTS and Extras are IDENTICAL to the U.K release!!!","To make it clear, the prints and extras are exactly identical to the U.K release.Alsoa very nice surprise The Metamorph episode is also included.A&E; has taken care of bringing what people wereasking since many years: IDENTICAL prints than U.K created by BBC Ressources in 2005 andthe most super and interesting extras/bonus which are completely new in North America.Without hesitation this set DESERVE your full support and the team of A&E; should becongratulate for their EXCELLENT work. DO NOT MISS YOUR CHANCE!!!BUY IT!!!"
4,Excelente,Excellent TV series.The picture quality is very good.Imperfections were removed the original series. I would have liked more extras.I hope the series comes out this form translated into SpanishI recommend purchasing
1,Good sets - Horrible series,"if you like this series, you're brain dead.The sets are great, but the scripts are ridiculously wrong about almost everything related to space.Barbara Bain's character is useless, and/or she must be seriously medicated.Unfortunately, I purchased the DVD version. Blu-ray no way.The blaring music is typical of this genre, but it really gets old/loud quick.The monster costumes are lame too.What can I say that's good about this series. Did I say the sets are good?Don't waste your money. This series is not worth watching, even in blu-ray."
3,Left many unanswered questions. rented it.,"I watched this movie and found their was many unanswered questions. For instance I wanted to know if a boy needed to have a castration or any other surgery to be a ""lady boy"". Was this necessary. I rented this movie and speeded right through it. It was interesting, but not worth the money amazon was asking for it. Even for five dollars I would decline the purchase."
4,Helpful and portable...,"This book is a great reference for the new or seasoned Star Wars collector. The prices give you a point of reference to begin the second hardest part of being a collector of anything, not just Star Wars merchandise, the wheeling and dealing. (The hardest thing being finding the right items for your collection.) Some pictures are helpful but others just fill space on the page. Merchandise as colorful as Star Wars products lose something if not seen in color. Differences that are obvious in color are not so obvious when in black and white. However, overall the book is great and recommended. Perfect for trips to yard sales and flea malls. The small size is a great asset. Put the book in a pocket or purse and let's go find that R2-D2 with Holographic Leia!!! Best of luck, true believers..."
5,Informative and entertaining!,I had the pleasure of discovering this book recently. I was searching for an answer on the web and came upon this Rabbi's site (http://www.rabbiron.com). This book was listed there. It is a fun read - not something you have to read all at once. It's divided into many sections so you can find specific answers easily or just browse some of the more intriguing ones.I think it's great for adults looking to learn more and for kids to introduce them to a lot of the basics of Judaism.Highly recommended!
2,poor customer service/poor product,"I ordered this product AND paid extra for shipping. It took over a week to receive. I am NOT happy.The product has good information, but I am NOT happy with the mistakes. The manufacturers of the drugs do not look as if they have ever been updated. For example, there are cards with GlaxoWelcome, GlaxoSmithKline, and SmithKlineBeecham. This really makes me wonder if the rest of the information is correct."
2,Sleeper,If you need to fall asleep but can't....try this book. Story line is okay however it goes down hill from there. The characters are unbelievable and what little conversation there is between them is stilted. Grammer is horrible and many misspelled words. All in all .99 is too much to pay for this book.
5,Deep and Profound,"The Power of Faithful Focus is a deep, inspiring and profound writing. Each time you pick it up the Lord speaks anew to you. Besides a Practical Christian Guide to Spiritual and Personal Abundance it also serves as a daily devotional and motivational piece. Charlie Self writes; ""Life does not just happen to you."" ""Don't get caught in the trap of analysis paralysis"", which we can all so easily do.I learned the circumstances have never been our real problem. God is always greater than anything out there. The real problem is the battles inside our own minds and hearts which in turn creates our habits. Furthermore, Charlie's chapters on work habits, and the use of goal setting are awesome.He who heeds discipline shows the way to life. --Proverbs 10:17 (KJV)A must read.C. Conley"
2,Well.. Buy the original albums instead.,I don't see this album representing what Yellowjacets can do. I really don't. Buy the individual albums instead. That's where Yellowjackets really shows what they can do.
4,"Nice Camera, but unfortunately does not work with Linux!","I traded a Minolta Dimage Xt for the Optio S yesterday.Everything the other reviews say seems to be true.I like the size, picture quality, etc, dislike the small 4-way-controller, flimsy battery-cover.The software for the Macintosh is horrible,fortunately with OS X you don't need it: iPhoto 4 or the Gimp works fine with it, and Quicktime plays the movies.On WindozeXP the camera was not recognized and it took a few reboots to get the driver to work.But for me the biggest NEGATIVE is that it is not recognized by the usb-storage module in Linux (kernel 2.4.20-18.9).The Sandisk disk is recognized (in a Cruzer USB connector), andso was the Dimage Xt, but the Optio is listed as an unknown device and can't be mounted.So if Pentax does not come up with a firmware upgrade to make USB conform to modern standards, I will return it and get the Minolta Dimage Xt back."
2,Way too Fragile!!!!,just bought the Pentax S few weeks ago. Put it in the pocket....display broken! $120 repair. No comparison with the powershot from canon that was living in my pocket!Other than that it's really small and light...maybe too much!
1,Pentax? Never Again!,"I've bought Optios S from amazon 1,5 year ago. It came with a malfunctioning LCD. Thankfully amazon sent me another one because as I saw the service (!!??) of Pentax I don't think that they would accept such a thing.The new camera was good for a while. Very light. Even with its original bag. Easy to use, easy to transfer. Fine picture quality for a 3mp camera. But...Then one day it said memory card error. I've lost all my pictures in it and I was left with a broken memory card. I thought it was a problem of the memory card. But this happened with 3 other memory cards too. My one year was over. I don't think anything would change if it wasn't over.Now it started to have focusing problems. I'm using my camera very rarely and keeping it in a good condition. I don't suggest Pentax to anybody anymore."
5,Small camera with a knockout punch,"I have only one complain about this camera. The menu joystick on the back is very sensitive and takes a little getting use to. With that said, everything else about it is absolutely great!!! I sold my Canon S230 to purchase this camera and I am very satisfied with it. It has a lot of features than the S230, its way smaller, better picture quality (IMO), and it has a 3X optical zoom. The red eye reduction flash actually works, unlike the S230 plus it has a great fill flash program. The macro mode is excellent. I think I will be keeping this camera around for long while. And if that's not all it has a voice recorder built-in too. Oh...you can also adjust the sharpness, contrast, and saturation of the images and crop them in the camera. Damn, when Pentax went after Canon did they it vengence."
5,Had the Optio S almost a year and still love it!,"This tiny camera is the best investment I ever made. I have four small children, we travel alot, kids are involved in sports, dance etc...so I was always bummed if I forgot my camera. With it in it's tiny ""Altoids"" case I always have it with me. It easily tucks into a pocket so I have taken it snow skiing, rollerblading, ice skating, boating, para-sailing, rock climbing, on roller coasters, and the sound can be shut off so I have even taken it into church and no one knows that I have taken a picture or video clips of my kids when they give their little talks. It is easy to use and the pictures download fast and easily. Picture quality for the size of the camera is great, even up to 8X10. I did have trouble with the original battery and have yet to mail it in before the warranty is up. New ones are only $30 though. I have taken thousands and thousands of pictures with this camera and I still love it given the chance, I would buy it again tomorrow!"
5,A great little camera!,"Overall, I'm really happy with this camera. I wanted something small and light with good picture quality. For a 3 megapixel camera, you can't beat this size. It also gets two big thumbs for Wow factor. It's a lot of fun to show this thing off.My only complaint is that powering on and off and focusing/snapping pictures is a little slower than I would like. One reason I carry this thing around with me is to catch candid shots of people and places, so the delay in turning on, focusing, and snapping the picture has cost me some cool shots. Otherwise, the Optio S rocks."
4,Almost perfect camera,"First off, this camera rocks. The number of options on it boggle the mind. I have gone through them and they do make a difference. The other nice thing is that the interface is very intuitive. I've read through the manual once and now all of the icons make perfect sense. The camera takes high quality pictures. I simply love the fact that it fits in an Altoids tin. I keep it in my pocket and I don't even notice it. :-)Now, the reasons for not a perfect 5.1 - The battery life is short. I have a 256 MB card, and I can't get through it without recharing.2 - The software isn't exactly great. ACD starts up every time that the camera is attached. Then it promptly crashes. Thankfully, it works once the pics are copied to the hard drive."
5,Outstanding !!SMALLEST & BEST Digital camera out there,"This camera is phenominal.The greatest feature is the small size without sacrificing the quality and features. It really fits into an altoids tin. If you are looking for the smallest camera with all the features of the MONSTER SIZED digital cameras out there, then this is the one for you.I compared this to the ""Casio Exilim EX-Z3"" before buying and did a comparison study and finally settled for this one."
2,"Nice, small, fragile","This is a nice camera. However, it is very fragile - mine broke in less than 2 weeks and Pentax will not cover the ... repair. Apparently my camera was subject to too much vibration/shock - I specifically did not follow the instructions to only transport it ""on a cushion for protection (against vibrations, shocks or pressure) when the camera is subjected to the vibrations of a motorbike, car, or ship, etc."" So, you might want to balance the advantages of the small size versus the fragility in considering portability. So far as I know, 'cushions' are not recommended for transport of other small portable digital cameras in automobiles."
2,Terrible snapshot quality; okay for scenic pix,"This camera fell far short of my expectations; my friends with cheaper, lower resolution digital cameras are able to take far better pictures. Having read the reviews, I've kept/tried to use it for almost a year/several vacations and will have to purchase another camera soon. The size is cool and outdoor, scenic picture quality is good, but that's about it."
2,Pentax Optio S Service,"I purchased a Pentax Optio S in May, It worked good for only 1 and 1/2 months. Then it Just stoppped recording pictures either to the internal memory of to the SD card I had puchased. I shipped to Pentax service and in about 4 weeks got a letter stating that it had been water damaged and they would not fix under warrentry. Wanted [$$] to fix or replace. I called and talked to them, stating that I had not gotten any water in the camera at anytime. They refused to believe me and would not fix the camera. So I am out neary [$$] cost of camera. I would not recommend this or any other Pentex product to any one."
2,Bad,There nothing wrong with the DVD but it is setup for play in Europe and not in the US. I have watch once on my home computer but not on my big screen tv. My mistake for not checking closer on zone area of the DVD. Delivery was fine and your product was great just a mistake on my part.Dick Millan
4,Mityvac 7300,I have used it once since I purchased it and it is nice to receive a product that does what it is advertised to do. Instructions are ok.
5,owner small business,"this product is a time saver for my business. and works great, my first one was a pump extractor and lasted 15 years. I passed it on to my son and it still works I just wanted to up grade."
3,Tubing sucks (Actually it fails to suck),"Device is OK, but the tubing should be redesigned. They use cheap tubing that becomes brittle after use, and the rubber stoppers they use remind of a child's chemistry class. For the cost of this device, the tubing needs to be longer, and the fittings need to be air-tight brass quick disconnect. This is 2009, and it's ridiculous to sell a product that leaks air like a sieve. Also tubing gets VERY hot when draining the oil, so wear gloves. While I was able to drain the oil from my Porsche Boxster, since it low to the ground; I had to lift the tank up in the air to drain the oil from my Jeep Grand Cherokee. How frigging much would it have cost to have made the lines 2 to 3 feet longer??? The pro's are that they include 3 sizes of tubing along with a hose that I think is to be used to bleed your brakes."
5,works great,great for sucking gas out of small engine gas tanks before storage. has no problem lifting out warmish gear oil
5,Convienient,I absolutly love this tool. It does just what it says. It's nice to be hands free as long as you have an air source...
3,Worked great but...,"...it stopped working after the first couple of times I used it. Used it to extract coolant...worked great. Cleaned up and put away. Used it next to evacuate transmission fluid. Worked great, cleaned up, put away. Time for oil change rolled around get it out...nothing. No blocked lines, diaphragm hisses as should, no suction. Very disappointed that a nearly $100 item only worked a couple of times. Unlikely I will buy again."
5,Greate & Easy to read book,Its a great book! Its simple and with lots of graphics! Best for those who doesn't like lengthy paragraphs. It uses cartoon to introduce the basics of developing a marketing plan.

2,Word of Warning,"I purchased this book with the intention of enhancing, believe it or not, my efficiency on a financial calculator.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU HAVE A HP 10B, HP 17BII OR A TI BAII PLUS.I didn't so it was fairly ineffective, you can pick up little tips here and there but you are better of having a good read of the calculators owners manual."
2,In search of a better guide,"This book was too basic, and it hopped around too much. I am still looking for a good ""how to"" book on using these calculators. I guess I would have preferred a workbook of problems. Perhaps a workbook would help me harness the full power of a financial calculator."
4,Good book with nice ideas and pictures.,For a straw bales book that will stir the ideas and give a few sources along with pictures this is a good book to have.
2,Wrong model,"I received my part perfectly and in great condition. However, the part was not the exact fit for my truck. There should be more specific options to choose from to determine the exact vehicle application. Thankfully my mechanic is a genious and morphed the old part with the new to fix it. The fact that I live outside the US makes returning a part difficult. So at least it worked out."
1,terrible and awlful cds scratched and he has taken not action,"i get five cds that were supposed to be in good shapeand one skips and four of the five were scratched. i have had to have them resurfaced twice and one three times. this person will not contact me so this needs to be addressed, please be careful doing business with this person. they will not take care of the customer and do a needed refunded. this is from chestnut from nashville, tennessee, please do not do business with them"
1,DO NOT BUY - What you see is not what you get.,I purchased two of these cork boards for the office in my new new home and what I received was something completely different than what was pictured. What I received was an average bulletin board that I could go out to a myriad of local businesses to buy. It was not surrounded by carved wood and painted antique white as pictured by it was surrounded by cheap upainted wood like every other cork board out there. I think someone messed up when they uploaded this picture for this product number.
1,"I agree, Do NOT buy this","Just received my order today.It does not look anything like the picture.I don't know what is going on with this, but I'm not happy.L. Boone"
5,Un clasico del rock pop sudamericano,Un muy buen disco de prinicpio a fin donde escuchamos a un Gonzalo Yañez al inicio de su carrera pero con unas letras igual de maduras como un artista de una larga trayectoria. Sin duda alguna este disco es uno de esos que se deben de tener si se es un gustoso del buen rock (poco mas pop) sudamericano.
4,A Good Thing Continues,"Kasparov's release of MGPIII continues a fine series. The annotations are superb, and his opinions on the historical importance of former world champions Petrosian and Spassky (as well as other important players such as Portisch, Stein, Gligoric, and Polugaevsky) make the book (and the MGP series) relevant. A slight quibble is the chapter on Spassky-you never get a true sense of what made him so admired away from the chessboard. Still, a fine work."
2,Not as good as his earlier books,"It seems that the author with doing well with his earler books (being a former world champion) has become slopy. I found some typos and the author seems to have an very opinated attitude toward some of the other world champions. In other words he things he (himself) is the greatest champion of all time, but the others are behind him in skill. I don't like the attitude in the book."
4,Great towel,Nice thick club towel. Just comes with a standard shoddy clasp to hold on bag. It has come off multiple times. If it weren't for clasp would have gotten 5 star. I have replaced that and the towel itself is great. SemperFi!
1,MISSING PAGE/S!,"A good, informative book but with a fatal flaw -- there's at least one missing page!"
5,100% about arrangement of scenes/shots,i found the last half of the book really interesting. the author used hand drawn storyboard style scenes from famous hollywood movies to show the methods described in the book.
4,Air Conditioner Cover,It was easier to put on then the comments in the reviews. My wife still wanted the unit taken out of the window in winter.
1,"Almost impossible to install, doesn't help much","First off, I suggest that you have at least 3-4 people with you when you try to install these. Invite your mother, your brother, your sister, everyone over to try to get them on. Otherwise, you will never get it on. The reason for this is that it isn't just the cloth that you see in the photo - there is a liner you have to tape on to the thing, and it is almost impossible to keep it still while installing it. I was literally screaming and cursing while trying to get it to work.Second, it doesn't really seem to help that much. Maybe it was that I couldn't install it correctly by myself, but I still feel a draft coming from around the AC unit.Save your money, buy something else."
2,Air condition cover,I ordered it because I thought it would be ideal for the inside air conditioner in my bedroom. I measured specificalyfor that reason. When the cover arrived it was too large to fit over my air conditioner so I really have no use forwhat I purchased. It was a waste of my time and money.
3,Gets the job done,This cover gets the job done but a sort of one size fits all does not look too great. Not very neat.
1,Service was just fine,"The item looked fine, but I ordered one to fit a 14"" high and a 20"" long conditioner, and the one I got was way to small. Maybe would fit a 8"" X 14"" conditioner. I wanted to return it but the slip had been lost because I just put it away for winter instead of trying it ou. It looked OK at the time.If Amazon reads this. Please let me return it for a much bigger one. Phyllis McGuire"
2,Decent job of blocking cold air. Hard to install cover.,"Comes as 2 parts to the kit. Some bendable sheets of styrofoamy material which you tape around the a/c unit then the white cover to put over the unit kinda like a bed sheet. Only problem with mine was the cover sheet's nylon around the edge broke so now it's larger then it needs to be. Oh well, I have it around the unit now with some tape which is how it's going to be used."
4,Good Indoor AC Cover,Product worked fine for the small air conditioner that I installed it on. Very easy to install and stopped the drafts through the unit.
4,Air conditioner covers,I found these a little difficult to get on the airconditioners at first. The second one went on a little easier. I will continue to use these covers as its much easier then having to carry the conditioners up and down the stairs. I will however add a little more padding to the north facing window next year. Overall I am satisfied with these and would recommend the covers
5,The best overall value in vacuum bleeders,"The MightVac has many features that surpass it's more expensive counterparts like the Vacula. It is a shorter design, which makes it easier to fit under your vehicle and much more stable when filling up with fluid as it's less likely to tip over. It comes with a variety of universal connections and everything you need to use it and start bleeding brakes. You'll need an air compressor with a tank to operate this, it's not a hand-vac like the cheaper bleeders.Overall this is exactly what I needed, and it's able to pull fluid through the brake system to cut down on bleed time. As a side-note, we always finish the bleed the old-school way (engine off, pumping the brakes) gut to make sure we have a perfect, firm pedal feel (which softens up once the engine is running).I ordered this on the West Coast and received within a week in time to bleed my brakes for a track event in my car. 100% satisfied."
2,Serpent of the Nile,"Dont get me wrong I love the content of the book, however I had owned a copy of the book before that was a larger A4 size book. I was very disappointed when this copy turned up and it is a much smaller book (almost half the size) and so all those lovely images do not have the same impact. Also I preferred the image of the original books cover. The quality of the cover wasn't there either."
5,"Wonderfully informative, beautiful pictures, well researched","This book is well written, and well documented throughout. The history is written to lead you through the the years with a clear perspective of the people of differant regions at the time. This is a must have for anyone who loves middle eastern dance."
2,great pictures but...,"The quality and quantity of pictures in this book is wonderful and there is also some good information but unfortunately all the information is not very accurate and there are even many things that are not true. As a book this is nice to watch but as this book has become ""a bible of belly dance"" when other more accurate documents have been hard to find I can't rate this higher because readers tend to believe everything that is written here."
4,"For the Pictures, if Nothing Else","I can't speak to the accuracy of Wendy Buonaventura's history of belly dancing, though I found no evidence of the most controversial complaint, that she fails to note the role of European Orientalists in fabricating our notions of Middle-Eastern dance. In fact, she discusses this very thing at length.The treasure in the book is the collection of paintings. Where else can you see Dinet's gorgeous watercolors? I had never even heard of him. Are the pictures accurate? I suspect they are. Are they representative? Of course not. Like Gauguin in Tahiti, the Orientalists saw what they wanted to see."
1,New-age book.,This book mixes culture with stereotype and fact with fiction. If you buy it for the pretty pictures just don't think it's anthropological.
3,Little Misleading,"I was a little disapointed in this book. I expected random interested facts written in the style of Michael. Instead, it is a alphabetical list of random items from the Encyclopedia Brittanica with only snippets of Michael's insight. Still read it though. It was better than a sleeping pill. 2 pages and I would be out like a light."
2,Glad You Asked,"I thought this book would be interesting to find little known facts and become updated on subjects already known. Michael Feldman introduces each section and provides humorous anecdotal remarks, but from the start gets it wrong. He introduces the book and praises Encyclopedia Britannica on massing great information, but on page xii he errs with ""...bezoars,fossilized stones of animal dung, were once widely praised and prized as magical cure-alls..."".A bezoar is ingested foreign matter that does not pass though the intestines. The word he was looking for is coprolite, fossilized dung. I bring this up because if the introduction isn't correct, how can we believe the rest of the book? The editors of the encyclopedia should have proofed it."
4,Good book.,Bought this for class. It worked well. It is well-written in an easy manner. Glad to have bought this product and recommend this.
3,Okay if you can get past the Microsoft bashing,"I agree that there are lots of unnecessary examples and wayyyyyy too much paper used to make this a great book. I also got very tired, very fast, of all the pointless Microsoft bashing. You could probably save a forest if you took out all the unnecessary pokes and prods at the big M. Stick with O'Reilly texts if you want to learn quickly."
2,Doesn't cover DOM and SAX,"I haven' read the book, only browsed its TOC. It doesn't cover the Document Object Model (DOM) and the Simple API for XML (SAX). It also discusses CSS in too much detail. These days, web development professionals will probably have a knowledge of both HTML and CSS before starting with XML.Consider ""Beginning XML"" or ""Professional XML"" instead, both published by Wrow."
1,Too wordy,"Obviously the anthor want to make this book as long as possible. But I dont know why! Life is too short to read this kind of wordy book. I would rather pay twice as much for a book w/ the same spirit, yet three times shorter!"
1,A big disaster..,"I don't quite know the target audience of this book. In my opinion, it is neither for a novice nor a guru. I was looking for an easy way to migrate from HTML to XML but this book didn't have anything from that standpoint. None of the concepts are explained using one simple example. The example used is not complex but tedious to emulate and the document itself spans several pages. Least of all, this just can't be used as a reference material cause u can't find anything easily..even the indexes suck bigtime,the less said the better. I don't know about better books on the topic but i suggest look seriously at other options. Something on the lines of Java Sourcebook which is concise and conceptually brilliant would be a blessing for XML."
1,Who said bad things are cheap?,"Its not enough being a very bad reference it is also veryexpensive (...)This book should not be allowed to be printed it is simply a hoax. Pages and pages spent with long examples containing long listings of useless data (like the USA baseball league examples) Those lists are spread all over the book, and if put together would consume more than a 100 pages of this book. The subject ""XML"" and its applications are approached slowly and superficially with POOR examples, the reading becomes uninteresting and fastidious. If one wants to waste money is better to through his bucks in the garbage! This book I wouldn't recommend for an enemy."
2,"Tedious, with unnecessarily super-sized examples","A good technical book should not be a doorstop. Instead, the book needs to explain the topics concisely, use brief and coherent examples that illustrate the text, and where alternative implementations are available, explain the alternatives briefly but save the detailed exposition for the recommended path. Instead, this book just uses lots of paper to provide far too detailed examples with little bits of explanatory material squeezed in...that go into way too much detail themselves. Also: It's BORRRRING. Yuck."
2,This book is blah-blah-blah!,"I am new to XML but not new to programming and web programming especially. So far I made it grudgingly to Chapter 8. I am very disappointed. The book gives huge examples to show something really small. Typical example: sample code starting at p.72 down to p.78 - a seven page example!!! What the heck?! Why does anybodoy need such a huge example? I will fall asleep before I read through the code not mentioning typing it in. Useless! All the programming books I have read so far rarely go above 2 pages of sample coding. I think it's too much blah-blah-blah! Keep it short, guys, I don't have time to read all that stuff!!! I don't know if I am gonna make it till the end but if I do I will probably reward myself for that."
5,"Please review the author's books, not his politics",To the previous reviewer - this is a vehicle for evaluating the book in question not for sharing your misinterpretation of the author's political statements.
3,What about the Mac?,"I have just purchased this book, and I'm debating if I should send it back. I use a Macintosh, and although there is an XML Editor out there for the Mac (Emile Pro) this book and it's CD are non-inclusive of users of the Mac platform. It says so on page Xiii in the book but there was no warning online before I bought it. Too bad, considering it would have been a small effort for a book about a platform-independent development tool."
1,It is a bad reference book for XML,"Warn! Don't Buy it!I bought this book because I saw the ranking is so high and I have a project need to use XML to implement. However, it did no help for my project. My teammate has a better one where the examples are more and useful than this one.<professional XML, Publisher:WROX> That's how we figured out, and finished the project."
2,Much too long,"I suddenly understand why the book was marked at 50% off. The actual contents of this 1,000 page monster of a book could be reduced to 300 pages or so. The rest of the book is just a long program listing, often repeating examples already shown with just a few lines changed.What's left is a good introductory text, that makes for a good one-time read. I wouldn't want to use the book for reference, tho'"
5,Fantastic XML reference,Reference book ordered to assist in understanding implementation of XML in DB2 version 9. Topic identification is great. Task examples are great. Overall product is great. This was a used product. Quality rated was accurate. Price was generous.
2,Do not buy this book,I bought this book few months back and finally got around to reading it. I bought it because I thought the reviews were excellent. I am really disappointed as this book has many mistakes just in the first 4 chapters I have read. This is very frustrating if you are a beginner. Such a waste of time and money. Go with some other book.
4,Nice choice for beginning XML,"This book does a terrific job of covering every possible aspect of XML technology, but not in-depth enough for the professional. There is extensive coverage of DTD and Schemas, but not as detailed as some other titles. Let this be your first XML book, and plan to add additional books with more detail and examples."
4,Holes over both toes!,"Bought them a year or so ago and only use them at my club 3-4 times a week for walking. I could see after several (6?)months that my left toe portion was wearing through and then a number of months after that(6?) the right toe wore through. I was changing into my civiies at my club and looked over and saw a guy with the same shoe with an identical hole. I started laughing and he said the shoe is prone to do that but he likes them so much that he continues to buy them. Well, they are indeed comfortable. Makes it difficult to evaluate them."
4,One Good shoe,"I am not what one would call an avid jogger. I go out 2 or 3 times per week for 5 mile runs. At 6 ft 190 pounds, I wanted a well supporting jogging shoe. These shoes are very comfortable. They took it a bit longer to break in than my last pair (Nike) but I will not hold that against them. I am a sized 10 with an average width foot and these shoes fit like a glove. If you prefer to have a bit more wiggle room, I would suggest moving up a half size. To be a bit more descriptive, it feel as though your foot sits in a cradle of sorts. I have to tinker around with lace tightness to avoid any any post run discomfort.It seems as though the prices for jogging sneakers can get out of hand. At $65 this is a quality product and I am sure that they will hold well as my Nike pair did.Several reviews noted that these sneakers are ideal for joggers who are heavier set/more muscular and I agree as well."
4,ASICS Men's Running Shoes,They feel comfortable & likes the fact that they are mesh so that if you have hammer toes there is plenty of room for stretch.
1,Maybe defective,"When they arrived I put them on and felt a sharp slope on the bottom of my foot, directly down from my ankle, where the heel and arch meet. I took it off and saw the slope. I know they are for pronators and that's why I got them. I'm assuming the slope is supposed to be on the inside of your heel to keep it from rolling inward. When I put the shoe on my heel/arch is sitting on top of the slope. Extremely uncomfortable obviously.This is the 2nd asics I've owned, previous was the nimbus 13. Those fit really well aside from some left arch pain due to the arch being too high for my left foot (almost flat footed). I wanted to get in shape and pick up a running regimine but I'm getting discouraged now."
4,Gt2160,"So far so good, feel good, no pain, no blisters. Going to wear them in a 10k run at the end of March. Hope they hold up. It's my first pair of ASICS."
5,they're working great for me!,now i have no excuse not to do my cardio! arg! they're great though. fast shipping and cheaper than at the mall.
4,Good Shoe,"I got this a month back, I should say its pretty much good. The only con I found the sole to be too thick, not sure if everyone would like it."
2,Nice shoe but does not last long,"I am on my second pair of these. Though they are a good shoe, your little toes will rip the mesh just behind the red and black swoosh on the sides which makes the shoes unusable. Pretty expensive shoe for that to happen."
3,Poor manufacturing consistentcy,"Bought a pair of 2160's last October and have loved them. I recently saw them onsale due to the release of the 2170's so I decided to buy two more pair. As soon as I received them I knew right away something was wrong. I put the new ones next to the old ones and right away I could see they were not manufatured the same. While they had exactly the same marking and design on the top of the shoe, the soles were different. My old pair had a flared sole around the edges which is typical of running shoes, while the new ones had a sole that was flat all around the shoe. You can see that this effected the toebox which is more narrow on the newer pairs. I then ordered a pair of Gel Cumulus 13 and guess what? There was the flared sole again, not to mention plenty of room in the toebox. Hey ASICS, how about some manufacturing consistency?"
4,Asics the shoe for me,"Due to bio-mechanical foot and leg problems the mens Asics 2000 series has proved the the only shoe I can wear, exercising or not. The first one I bought was a 2020!! The 2160 is continuing to work for me. The only disappointment are the shoe laces, which are showing a tendency to work their way undone in spite of double knots, so long distance people be aware. Still that is a problem easily over come."
4,"Perfectly good shoe, great value.","I've been training in Asics for a long time using the DS Trainer and Nimbus. The majority of my miles are in the Nimbus. I started having a new knee pain while training for a marathon and thought I'd try introducing a new shoe into my rotation.Not surprisingly the GT-2160 didn't solve my knee pain but it was a nice change. I'd describe it as a middle ground between the DS and the Nimbus. It is not as responsive as the DS but it is softer and more structured feeling. It is less soft, but still more structured feeling, than the Nimbus. I'm taking off a star for a certain dull/woodness in the feel. Of course all of this is hugely subjective.I will say the price is right on these. It's a great shoe for the money.Bottom Line: I'll buy another pair.For comparison I'm fairly unremarkable runner (low/normal arch, average width foot, neutral ankles, slightly external foot progression angle, heel striker, 65kg, 25-75mi/wk)."
5,Fit a little snugly but beyond that they feel great!,I have always been a regular width shoe guy. But with these I feel like maybe I should've gone for the Wide setting (if it's even available). They fit very snugly for 11s when I usually go for about a 10.5M. So keep that in mind.
4,Fits a bit too tight.,Nice comfy shoes.My only gripe is it's a bit too tight around the middle part of the shoe.I normally wear 10-10.5 I ordered size 11 (since there were no wide options avaialbe for 10/10.5) and it still feels tighter than my old Nike which was 10.5.I decided to keep it though hope it will loosen up a bit with regular use.Other than the sizing issue this is a great pair of running shoes..stylish and light weight.
4,Awesome for short runs,"I have flat feet but i tend to land on my heel and underpronate like hell.Never the less, this is an awesome shoe, but it's nothing like the 2150.It seems to have less cussion but weights a lot less than it's predecessor, that's why i reccommend for short runs, for people like me with bad feet.4 starts, asics always makes the best running shoe."
3,Run's Narrow,"I wear a size 14 and normally fit comfortably in a Medium width shoe. In fact, my last pair of running shoes were Asics 2150's and they fit awesome. This newer model seems to be a bit more narrow than the last. So if your feet are more on the wide side, I'd consider ordering the shoe in a greater width."
4,Awsome,i have been running for about 4 and a half years and gone threw about 4 different kind of shoes and these shoes are the best i have tried so far. they are very comfortable and light and i might buy by the same kind after i wear these out. definitely recommend...
1,This shoe is not for everyone,"Bought this as a 2nd pair. 1st pair paid $50. I thought maybe it was a cheap pair. 2nd pair, I paid $100. It still the same. The shoe is not confortable and seems to hurt at the heel. I'd stay with Nike."
1,Too big!,"I've been a runner for a long time, and I've logged over 10,000 miles. I thought I would give ASICS a try. I wear size 11. No matter what type of show I get, its always size 11. ASICS apparently decided that their sizes would follow some different rules, because these are at least a half size too big. Disappointed."
2,ASICS Men's GT-2160 Running Shoe Review,I was not a fan of this shoe. I wish I would have known that this shoe did not cater to those who's stride is underpronated. I wore these shoes four times and they began running over on the sides. Totally pissed me off considering how much I paid for them.
2,Almost but not for me,"The rating is more of a 2.5 star for me. The shoes fit great and they are true to size, the cushioning is without a doubt COMFORTABLE. However when I first gave these shoes a test run I noticed that my heel felt like it was about slip out of the shoes. I tightened the lacing even more but that cuaused a little discomfort."
2,ASICS Men's GT 2160 Running Shoes Black,"Firstly, I have always been satisfied with my purchases through AMAZON.The shoes are good overall although they are not as comfortable as AICS Gel models.My disappointment is that the shoes contain some minor white dots on the inside rubber/plastic part of both shoes.The white dots seem to be part of the rubber and it appears they can not be removed.I did not notice this when I opened the box mainly because the shoes were facing with the outdside of the shoe up.As they were a present for my son for Chrismas I was satisfied with this brief inspection.Obviously, I have learned from this.Is it a major problem? No, more annoying and disappointed then anything elsegiven these were a present.I would have expected this to be picked up by the supplier before shipping it out."
5,Awesome running shoe,"Over the years, I've tried many different brands of running shoes. I always end up going back to Asics. So when I found something I liked, I wanted to purchase a few pair for future back-up. These shoes are very durable, provide great support, and don't get worn out early. I'm not using any inserts and find the arch support to be great for me. While these aren't the lightest shoes, they certainly aren't the heaviest either. I'll be picking up a few more to keep in my closet before they are gone since the new model has been out for a bit now. Anyone looking for a comfortable running shoe that won't disappoint, look no further. Great job again Asics!"
2,No Way,"The drama of the book is very exciting, but I do not like the way the author writes. The author Zane writes better towards my liking. The way these authors write are totally different. Zane is more toward the African Americans. This author write big words I've never even heard of and the writing is just horible. The book is very enjoyable and drama filled but I can't get into it because of the way the author writes."
4,Interesting,"This book kept my interest, it had high and low parts. Ending didnt leave me hanging. I would recommend this book if you are looking for something easy,dramatic,a good train read."
3,always a little different,"I've enjoyed several women writers work for the first time recently. Joyce Carol Oates, Joan Didion and Darcy Steinke are a few that come to mind. Kathryn Harrison's work stands up well against these folks with one exception, her ability to close stories in a believable and interesting manner seems to be a notch below.This book was a very good read and could provide another great movie role for Bill Murray but the ending was not on par with the premise. It is my favorite after the Seal's Wife and I hope that she continues to delve into areas of the human condition that seems to have a women only sign on the door."
2,slow and slower,"Not that great , story really drags and is hard to keep up as the reader does not develop much interest."
5,Great book!,"Well, I needed the book for a paper I must deliver at College, so my opinion is biased ;DVery well-organised book, nice texts. It shouldn't be different, as Lefevere is a reference in translation of literature.Nice purchase!"
2,"Fascinating, but...","While Lyons has clearly done a mind boggling amount of research, I can't help wishing he'd done a bit more. I caught a couple of big mistakes, and there may well be yet more I'm not aware of. The ones I did get: in the review of The Sign of the Ram, he claims that this was Susan Peters ""first and only film."" In fact she made several films and was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Random Harvest! And in the review of Spectre of the Rose, Lyons misidentifies the leading actor: it's Ivan Kirov, not Michael Chekhov. (Chekhov does also appear in the film.) I found the book very interesting, but it would be a better book if Lyons had taken the time to get his facts straight."
4,Great Childhood memory,I have been looking for a copy of this movie since videos first came available to the general public. It has always eluded me. I saw it repeatedly on TV when I was young ( in the 50s and 60s). I was then one of my favorite movies. The pricing I have found on the black and white version is OUTRAGEOUS! I am also not partial to colorized movies. I prefer them in the original black and white. But this is a charming movie. It is about empowerment of self by kind and wise mentors. It is magical. It has everything you could want in a movie that entrances both children and adults.
2,Retro Flix DVD Not A Great Quality Resolution,Don't expect the same quality found on the 1999 IMAGE DVD of this same film. Retro Flix must have mastered this from a second generation video tape. Not worth the cost!
5,great plates at a great price,"I bought two plates since I needed some more 35's, and after seeing the really pathetic quality of some at a local store, I was a little doubtful. So I figured the price was a gamble worth taking.Well, I was very pleased when they arrived in 3 days in as good a condition as you can expect. These are the most inexpensive I have found anywhere, and although you may pay a few bucks for shipping, it is still a great deal in todays economy. I'll probably come back and get more as I need them."
5,Worth every penny,"This deflector allows you to have a conversation and listen to the radio at freeway speeds. It even keeps my hair in place. Visibility is not compromised at all. For convenience you can put the top up while the deflector is installed. With the windows up and the deflector in place, you can ride with the top down even in cold weather.It's easy to store and quick and easy to install. It has improved the convertible experience 100%."
2,Poorly written,"Only a few knots I found useful and one of those, from figure 1 to figure 2, is impossible as shown. Save your money and search the Internet for 'fishing knots' as much better tutorials are free."
4,Really Good Variety for light jazz fans,"Tracks from this one get a lot of play on light jazz-format stations, and deservedly so. Sort of a quiet-listening CD, although the title track is a James-Bond-esque thing which is a lot of fun. ""I went to bat for you"" and ""Sarah's theme"" are smokey-room saxophone jazz things. ""Jaqueline"" is a beautiful piano etude. ""Carmel"" is more symphonic in nature. If you like light jazz, it's easily worth the price."
3,For REALLY young children,"I bought this book for my 5-year-old, and even she found it too simplistic. She was looking for more information than the book provided. It's better for my son, who is 2."
5,Great for people with potassium issues,"My wife has extremely low potassium, and when she gets sick and/or throws up, her hands and cheeks start to tingle and cramp. After trips to the ER to figure out what was wrong, each time we discovered that it was her potassium. So now we buy these and whenever she starts to feel tingly, we can give her these. They melt in her mouth so she doesn't have to try to keep them down if she's vomiting. So glad we don't have to go to the ER anymore for this problem!"
5,cramps,Guys get cramps in there hands and legs BEST PRODUCT EVER... WORKS IN SECONDS. IHAVE BEEN USEING THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER 10 YEARS AND HIGHLY RECOMEND IT.
2,okay,Very flimsy and it bends easily. Not nearly as shaply as I had hoped however I will still be able to use it.
4,Bluegrass DVD,"I like the DVD, it gives some interesting advice on phrasing and singing, it is not for beginners but others might find the DVD useful. There is very little guitar playing advice but overall I like it and would recommend it to a friend."
3,"Great concept, but poorly executed.","There has been a real need for a text that explains how to use Visio for documenting software requirements. Likewise, there has been a real need for a text that shows how to tie the different UML diagrams together as part of a coherent and comprehensive process. This text promises to do both, and to some extent it succeeds, but it is far too fractured to live up to its initial promise.I would still recommend the text for anyone seeking an introduction to UML in Visio. The examples are very simple, however, and the discussion of UML is incomplete, so I would recommend using a UML text as an accompaniment to this one as you work through it."
