2,"Changed the story too much, as usual","The only saving grace of this movie for me, was Channing Tatum.Why change the type of cancer, why change the age of Tim, why change most of that? I just don't understand."
2,Soap opera,"This movie starts out so beautiful and romantic! I am a helpless romantic and after loving the Notebook, expect a pure love story that tugs on the heartstrings and can give you a good cry. This movie started out that way. Half way through, it becomes a bad made for Lifetime movie with a completely implausible plot line. Please, no one wouldn've expected such dribble. No one does the things she does in real life...No one.His character is more believable and you can undertand and sympathize his actions. Hers are completely unforgiveable and unbeliveable.Wacth this movie knowing you'll be as disapointed as I was......Adore the first half and wait for the 2nd half to be an ABC family movie!"
4,;0),"I liked it, I thought it was a touching story and the part with his dad I was bawling my eyes out, I was bawling sometimes. The whole concept of the movie was good the letter writing from both characters, the other stories that brought everything together was good. I put off watching this movie and glad I finally did. A good watch"
1,Dear John-based on Nicholas Sparks book of the same title,"I first listened to the audio version of the book word for word. The producers of the DVD did not fully stick to the story line. For example, the autistic boy and his brother, Tim, lost their parents in a car accident in the book. In the DVD Tim was the autistic boy's father with a mother who had abandoned them. During the book the full moon was emphasized since this is when the two lovers thought of each other when they were apart, John was off at war while Savannah off to college. This was downplayed in the DVD. This DVD was a great disappointment for me."
2,Not a good Movie (plot) but DVD quality was great,Opinion is based soely on the movie content. Actual DVD arrived a great condition and works great and bought as a gift - just did not care for the movie itself - could have been better!
5,"Not my kind of movie, but also not what this review should be about","Like the title says, this isn't my type of movie. I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend. My view is that this review should speak to the quality of the product I was sold by Amazon, not the substance of the movie.Keeping that in mind, the movie came and the packaging was pristine, the DVD was in it and free of scratches so in my eyes that is exactly what I ordered and deserves 5 stars.If you are considering buying the movie however:Many times during the movie I found myself thinking ""give me a break..."" in regards to some of the ""action"" scenes and other macho crap they tried to fit in. It's a love story. If you're into that then get it. Wasn't my cup of tea but it kept me entertained and the girlfriend happy."
3,"oops, ""I had no choice?""","Re: reviewers' comments about John's lack of emotion: It's not fair to blame an army guy (Special Forces, no less) for not showing emotion. I know VietNam veterans - Channing's portrayal was perfect...quiet, stonefaced, reserved.Savannah's idea of commitment is ""I will love you forever, or until I change my mind.""""I had no choice"" is truly the American mantra - the ultimate, mindless excuse for breaking any promise or committing any act. ""I had no choice"" is a trite cliche.John understood honor and commitment. We thought she did - until the going got a little tough. This writer led us love Savannah, along with John, and then changed her essential character! Lazy writing! Let's send boxes of dog poop to the writer.I can think of a dozen endings that would have been realistic AND satisfying for the audience. This was not an existential film - it could have had a happy ending! I wanted to shout at the screen ""It doesn't have to end this way!"""
3,"Sappy, but not terrible","An Army soldier and a young woman fall in love at the time of the 9/11 attack, and their relationship blossoms while he is away at war. They exchange letters regularly, with the distance having an effect on their romance. This is a standard, run of the mill melodrama. The performances are solid, as is the chemistry onscreen. Effectively done, but no new ground is being broken here."
3,Good but whyyy??,I just watched this movie.. I feel the moral duty to warn you about the ending of the movie..I wont tell you the ending.. Watch the movie as I did.... You will be dissapointed.. DONT WATCH THE ALTERNATE ENDING is even worst.. GOOD movie but the ending is baddddd.. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED...
4,Bittersweet.,"Dear John starring Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried is a beautiful and heartbreaking love story of wrong timing and second chances. Even though this film is way different than the Nicholas Sparks novel, I still think this romantic drama is just as good in certain aspects. Seyfried is really good in this film, she is a natural in front of the camera. The only gripe is with Tatum, his brooding performance is a little forced at times and I wish his chemistry with Seyfried was more stronger. Dear John is a solid flick, check it out sometime!"
3,Similar to the Book,"I think the cast did a great job with this movie - certainly a can't go wrong date night kind of flick. I had read the book previously, and while it was simlar to the book I really wish they would have held true to the ending (I'm not going to spoil it if you haevn't seen the movie or read the book)."
3,3 star,was a great movie till the end.it became depressing after the twin towers went down. and the relationship was shaky. I would rather watch a G movie with happiness.one of my favorite movies was Secret Of Nimh 1982. now you get an idea what kinda movies I like to watch. who want to see a sad movie.cute body on that guy man his body was excellent the diving into the ocean.Pretty boy Abercrombie & Fitch type body model when I first saw him.
1,one word boring,I wanted to buy this movie for my collection but decided to rent it instead i am so glad i didnt pay 20 dollars on a movie that is so boring and it dosent even make any since i was dying to see this movie like a lot of other people save your money dont buy it
1,Awful!,"I expected a film like the notebook, as a lot of people did. I went to see it with my boyfriend on valentines day and it was just awful! When it got to the end, I was waiting for it to START!Here is the whole movie.they meet and fall in love in two weekshis dads slow and likes coins.he goes back to the armyshe writes him a dear john letter, marries an old guyold guy dies, john comes back, who knows if they get married or not.so boring.anyone else feel the same? :(THE LAST SONG STARRING MILEY CYRUS IS WAY BETTER THAN THIS MOVIE!!"
1,If you're a soldier...,"This happens to nearly every soldier who gets deployed. We're not all SF, and we don't all get shot, but we do love, and we do get scared. It's nice to have somebody to think about and to know they feel the same when it hits the fan. TOO BAD THE CHICK IS NEVER FAITHFUL. Ask a soldier who's been deployed and he'll tell you the same thing. THE POINT I'M GETTING AT IS THAT THIS MOVIE IS A REMINDER OF SOME OF THE MOST HORRIBLE MOMENTS OF OUR LIVES FOR YOU TO SEE. The acting is very genuine and heartfelt. Which makes it so much more crushing.WHY MUST YOU PUT OUR PAIN ON DISPLAY? DID WE NOT SUFFER ENOUGH?"
2,Attactive actors wasted on a most ridiculous story,"Does anyone break up with the love of her life to marry a sick neighbor, and says she has no choice? People actually let a movie with this ridiculous plot made? Really? Seriously?"
4,Sad touching love story,"I loved this movie. It was shot beautifully and the actors played their parts very well. <<SPOILER>> The only thing I don't get is why she did what she did. It just doesn't make sense to me that she would throw away their own happiness for ""humanitarian"" reasons. Why not just adopt the kid? Is it to get back at him for staying in the Army? I feel so sorry for John."
1,Horrendous,"I saw this recently with a friend of mine at the cinema and we walked out half way through! The acting is abysmal (Channing Tatums shirtless scenes do not make up for this!), there is absolutely no chemistry between Channing and Amanda plus the whole movie has no flow. None of the scenes come together properly and I found it hard not to laugh out loud at some of the RIDICULOUS script writing, not to mention the fact that Channing Tatums character is very unlikeable. He is rude, bad tempered and aggressive. I cannot believe they released this movie."
2,Booooooring,"I am a big Nicholas Sparks fan. However, I read this book but didn't really enjoy it. I thought maybe the movie would be better since it got such great reviews. I was very wrong. The movie was extremely boring. I kept checking the time to see if it was almost over. I really didn't care if they ended up together when it was over or not."
5,Art pretending life... life imitating art...,"I really like ""Dear John"". It's intense, full of feelings and the actors play really hard to transfer the story to people's eyes and hearts.I could see myself a lot on it, hence my personal story in life, re: army, loss of the greatest love, etc, are my own story, with its own peculiarities.Those, though, who read the book and look forward to watch a real interpretation, will probably be somewhat disappointed... Since the book has a completely dynamic, nobody can fit a 300+ page into 100 minutes.It's worth to watch, mind-opened and try to understand the life of those to are in service overseas for their countries."
2,"Terrible movie, sick twist","I give 1 star for Channing Tatum's topless appearance,& 1 star for Amanda's singing. I didn't read the book so I couldn't understand the disgustingly sick twist of the girl marrying a sick older man for the sake of helping the autistic son. You don't have to marry a man to be altruistic. Not to mention a far more handsome heartthrob is so deeply in love with you & serving his country to protect all of us. The character Tim should be punched in the face. I would've given it a higher rating if they just cut out the twist. The part John reads his letter to his dying father is pretty touching, despite the rest of relatively bad acting delivered by Tatum. He's hot to look at though."
2,Devastatingly Different from the Book,"Dear John by Nicholas Sparks is one of my absolute favorite books. This may be because I'm a graduate of UNC, where a good portion of the book is set, but regardless of that fact, I have read the book numerous times and never get sick of its lovely story. I was, however, extremely disappointed by this film adaptation. This movie is drastically different from the book and that difference detracts from the story immensely. I would not recommend this movie if you read and liked the book.However, I have heard from others who have not read the book, that this movie was great. So, if you have not read Dear John, then I would recommend this movie. But as someone who read and re-read the book, this movie just didn't speak to me in the same way.For my forthcoming review of Dear John the book, visit my fiction book blog entitled ""Alice's Bookshelf.""Thanks,JB"
4,Amazing,"I saw the movie in theaters the weekend after it opened. I was extremely excited, it was something I had been waiting on for weeks. Some of my friends had told me they did not like it or it was not what they expected, even hearing that I was disappointed. About 30 minutes into the movie I started crying and it continued the remainder of the movie. Dear John, touched my heart in a way no movie has in a long time, I felt connected with the characters. I recommended this movie to all my friends and I recommend it to you too! It was everything I expected and more! :)"
3,IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO GREAT,"This movie had such potential. I was so looking forward to seeing it after reading the book. I guess my first mistake was finishing the books only days before seeing the movies. I guess I should have known it had the potential to be drastically changed after having seen A WALK TO REMEMBER several times before reading the book. It was soooo different. Too different, though still both very good stories.Why, oh why do authors let that happen! And movie directors. If a book is a hit, why in God's name would they change it? Not just change it but major changes. It makes me wonder which I should do...read Nicholas Sparks books or see his movies? It's not really working doing both."
2,Bland and unoriginal,"Super lame. Not even good for a chick flick. Go watch When Harry Met Sally or Titanic or Chasing Amy instead, because watching classic romance movies for the zillionth time is still better than Dear John."
4,Good But Sad,This is a common love story movie where you see the best and worst of the characters and how they fall for each other over a short ammount of time.
5,Great Love Story,"Great movie about real life. Shows the vulnerability that lies within all of us. The pain and distance is very evident between the father and son. Savannah was unable to continue with her life without John there by her side, so she chose to take an easier route. That route did not fulfill her life and she came to realize that. Both people learned what life is really about and if lucky it will be wonderful. Not everyone is that lucky.I wish they would have made the DVD in full screen. Not happy with that part."
1,Why????? Why would anyone make this movie?????,"If you love someone in the military, do NOT watch this movie. Trust me, it'll ruin your day. I was warned not to, but it was free on starz... so I said ""why not?""Well, I can now say that I have seen it and I hated it. And I have an irrational desire to scream at Miss Seyfried, even though I keep telling myself she is only an actress and did not really do those things...I'm not sure who the target audience was, but it clearly wasn't women who have actually been in such a situation."
2,"""Dear John"" hits all the same Nicholas Sparks notes and will make women weep","Length:: 6:15 MinsGina from Haunted Flower reviews the movie ""Dear John"" based on the book by Nicholas Sparks and starring Amanda Seyfried and Channing Tatum as young lovers writing letters.[...]"
5,Great,It took awhile to get to my house but when it did I was happy because it was pretty much brand new!
5,My husband is in this movie!!! LOL,Just kidding guys Channing Tatum is not my husband but A girl can dream right? anyways great movie loved it anything by nicholas sparks is great and I really loved this movie I watched it 5 times in one day when i got it. I know kinda overbord but i just loved it that much and i think you will too.
1,"I expected to love this, but","What a disappointment! Having nothing to do with how wonderful the book may have been, this, as a movie, was terrible! The acting was dreadful, the script was not good, and I couldn't understand any of the mumbling coming from Channing Tatum! We watched the deleted scenes, and at least twice I said to my daughter that it would have been nice to have seen that scene, because it would have explained something else that went on. The best part was the commentary from someone who worked on the film, talking about his coin collection, which was used in production. This is definitely one I will not look to watch again."
5,"""It's a wonderful love story""!","I absolutely ""LOVED"" this movie, I have read the book and the movie of course changed the story to Tim now being an older man in his thirty's with Alan portrayed as his younger son. In the novel, Tim is only a few years older and Alan is his younger brother. After reading the book and then watching the movie, you are a little taken back at first by those changes. The movie ending is much better than the book, in the book John moves on and stays alone. I would definitely say this movie is a must see, read the book to fill in everything they left out of this wonderful story. Nicholas Sparks is an Amazing story teller, grab a box of tissue's, it's a tear-jerker!"
3,Kens Rating,Given as a Christmas Gift..have not had any input from the folks that received it so not really in a position to provide more input/.
4,very fast shippping,thanks! everything got here fast and arrived in perfect shape! :) works well too no scratches. good day and thanks again.
4,Romance with a Realistic Twist,"I expected a pulpy rom-com in this movie, but got something more. The main love story is fraught with realistic problems that many couples face as well as one or two that are fairly unique. I felt the story had much more weight that expected. And the acting was quite good, too."
4,Romantic Moments,"I liked this one. I LOVE Channing Tatum but this film always falls short of ""love"" for me. Maybe it's the cross between romance and war that doesn't set for me. Maybe it's the olde song of the same title that doesn't set. I don't know. But it was okay and any fan of Channing's should have it."
1,sad,Ordered this for a friend of mine for a gift was happy to have some of my Christmas shopping done. I gave it and it didn't work in her blueray player so we tried mine and it still didn't work. I returned it only to have no response after it was returned. There was no refund and no exchange. I am just sad. First time I have ever had a problem with amazon and I will be doing less and less shopping here.
5,incredibly good book,"This has to be one of the best books on bodywork yet! It has made a significant difference in my work & my clients are experiencing much longer lasting results. Thank you, John Smith!"
5,Hard to find,"Nobody carried gatorback's around my location, I had a screaming belt that only this could fix. If it wasn't for Amazon.com I would have lost my mind by now. They found the correct belt for my 2004 Santa Fe with an unbelievable price and all is quiet on the eastern front.Thanks again - Gary"
4,Mega Man struts his stuff in another sequel,"Many people are tired of Mega Man and his dozens of games, but those people are also missing out on a great gaming experience. This is one of his best and it would be a shame to pass up. Sure the gameplay is basically the same as before, but what's wrong with that? The graphics and sound are still great and the story is more serious than other games in the series. Don't miss out on this."
4,So Good!,"We got this game when my dad bought us the PS1 for Christmas when the system first came out.Not being familiar with the Mega Man series I was a little eeeehhhh about playing it, but after watching my big brother who was a little familiar with Mega Man play it I decided to try my hand at it.I love how both Mega Man and Zero (which was my character of choice) had their own story-lines. And I loved how they would throw Animation clips within the game which was a refreshing seeing how most video games back then andnow you have to read & click to read the rest of the dialogue. I like how as you got higher into the game the stages actually got harder.Great game and I got addicted to it lol"
4,a fun game,"I liked this game. The character are funny and well designed, the graphics are really good, the polygons do not look messy or blocky. My favorite part of the game is the background, it is colorful and pretty (since this is a level game it helps keep it interesting). Buy it is it fun!"
4,Good background and sauce material,"There's some great stuff for your campaign in here. I've already used it in mine (a government conspiracy / Bigfoot sort of thing). Some of the artifacts could have had a better basis in history (but then again, maybe they do :-)"
1,Perhaps the WORST purchase I ever made,"This book is a complete waste of time. There is absolutely no information here that hasn't been said before. There is perhaps one or two sentences written about each episode and thats it! A total waste of time and money. You get 50 times more information in the Companion and at half the price. Additionally, there are a few pages of pictures that look like fifth generation zerox copies. STAY AWAY!!"
3,Let Cooler Heads Prevail,"As someone who has read all Anthony Burgess' novels, I must say that while Napoleon Symphony has it moments, it falls considerably short of his better achievements (Clockwork, Nothing Like the Sun, Earthly Powers, Dead Man in Deptford). Casting about the Internet for other reviews, it seems this work draws raves or rants: Raves from those transported by Burgess' linguistic felicity, rants from those overwhelmed by it (or scandalized by his liberties with good ol' Ludwig van).The best review I found, and it sums up my assessment perfectly, is by Sara Sanborn and appeared in the June 9, 1974, NY Times, but you will have to look it up as the link I provided was not posted by Amazon. Ms. Sanborn's assessment is spot on."
4,Enjoyable,Enjoyable evening of entertainment. Brief appearances by Mick Fleetwood and Peter Frampton add to younger Stevie's music at this outdoor concert.
4,"Live at Red Rocks,Vintage Stevie !","I just saw this video for the first time tonight of;""Stevie live at Red Rocks.""The only things that I didn't like about it was: First, it's not HD Digital so it's grainy.Second, that there isn't more video time with Peter Frampton and Mick Fleetwood-but the pictures that are there of Stevie and Mick are very intimate and beautiful, and finally, the song selection, I didn't think there were enough good ""hit"" songs on it.But she looks gorgeous! This is Vintage Stevie, for those of us that remember Fleetwood from the late 70's and early 80's this is a ""flash from the past"" of those times, and how we remember Stevie in those days. Not to say that she isn't still a lovely lady today, but for those of us from that era, this is the Stevie that we remember! Keep Rocking Stevie!!!!"
2,A difficult time in her life......,"I am a tried and true fan of Stevie Nicks. But, I must be honest, I was embarassed for her when I watched this concert video. She was nearing the end of a very dangerous drug and alcohol addiction. In fact, I have read that after this concert, she checked herself into a rehab. The setting was absolutely magical. The dove landing on her hand and not wanting to leave was symbolic and beautiful. As far as her performance, her voice never fails her, but she was screaming and sometimes singing in gibberish. I must say her first taped concert during the Bella Donna tour was superb in comparison! Apologies to other true fans like me, but I cannot lie about my opinion even though I love Stevie Nicks."
4,Good Video,"Not the best Stevie Nicks Video I have ever seen, but far from the worst. Stevie's etherial beauty and rich vocals come out wonderfully. In my opinion, there is too much pan and scan of things I'm not interested in, ie: anything but Stevie and the Band. Waddy on guitar, and Lori, Sharon, and Elisecia on backup vocals were marvelous. I'm sure you will hear some people whine about ""she doesn't follow the lyrics from the album"" DUH! this IS live music, and besides, these are HER songs, so she can change the words to suit her. Anyway, she could sing random words from the dictionary, and I would probably enjoy hearing it."
3,This video made me sad,"I was very upset when I saw this video. Infact, I wish I would have never bought it. It was a great disappointment. I didn't enjoy seeing Stevie so trashed out on drugs. She was screwing the words up to her songs and screeching.I am so happy Stevie decided to change. I cringed in certain parts of this video. I was embarrassed for Stevie. I can't believe they put this video out at all. It is very obvious it was edited and that ruined it. I still love Stevie very much but would not tell a die hard Stevie fan to watch this. It broke my heart to see Stevie this way. It reminded me of the Rock a little tour when she was much the same way. There were moments Stevie did an awesome job,but I think this is one you could definently skip! the hbo concert was much better."
2,I was at this Red Rocks Concert,"I am a long-time Stevie Nicks/Fleetwood Mac fan (since Sunday Break I in Austin, TX - 1977). I have had the pleasure of meeting Stevie Nicks and would love to see her in concert again. This Red Rocks concert was at a low point in her life/career and I would not recommend the DVD. As another reviewer put it - your time and energy would be better spent lobbying for a re-release of BuckinghamNicks."
2,what could have been,"In 1986 Stevie was at the height of her drug problems. Her Rock A Little tour was made up of some wild coked out performances, unfortunately this DVD is not an accurate representation of her actual show at Red Rocks. Fist of, the original vocals from this show are not included on the dvd. At the time, Stevies voice was very raw and ragged. She was not happy with them and the entire vocal track for this release was re-recorded in a studio. Many have commented on how good she sounds, well that is why. Second, there were quite a few songs left off of this release that were performed at this show. Stevie rarely releases live material, so its quite frustrating to have so much of the show missing from the actual release. If your a Stevie fan and have never seen her live, or if you want to see the visual part of a real Stevie show, then you may enjoy this dvd, but be aware that is not the complete show and it features dubbed in vocals."
1,Horrible picture and sound quality kills this DVD!,"I can't believe the reviews I have read on this DVD! Although its a nice return to the 1980's and Nick's old hits...the horrible sound quality and blurry picture quality make this product a waste of money! If you want to see Nicks sing her heart out in clear Dolby Digital 5.1....get the new 2004 release of Fleetwood Mac live in Boston...this DVD is as bad as anything I have ever seen. The only reason it deserves one star is for her live performance of ""Has Anybody Ever Written Anything For You"". She sings a powerful version of that beautiful, rare track that overshadows the poor picture and sound of the rest of this disc.Basically folks...skip this loser of a product and go for the new digitally recorded concert of her with Fleetwood Mac!"
3,"easy come,easy go","This is one dvd that could have been alittle better!There were some awesome camara shots and quality sound but only 9 song selections,and not all the ones I wanted to hear like beauty and the beast,come on.Also,be ready it was filmed in the '80's so its reflected the time."
3,Red Rock Video,The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it's Stevie Nicks. It's a upsetting to me because you can tell it's a bad time in her life by her performance and by the editing of the video. If you can get you hands on Stevie Nicks in Concert video snatch it. This concert made me a fan for life the first time I saw it on HBO in the early 1980's. Everytime they played it my eyes were clued to the TV....I couldn't get enough. If your looking for some good Mac video get The Dance
3,SHE'S GOOD BUT WIRED VERY TIGHT,"Stevie's voice was reduced to a raspy croak by the time ""Red Rocks"" came out, but there are a couple of songs that are great. The opening number, ""Outside the Rain"" is great, and Stevie does well with ""Stand Back"" and ""Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You."" Several songs are disappointing: ""Talk to Me"" sounds better on the CD and the closing version of ""Edge of Seventeen"" is awful. Stevie talk-sings her way through most of this song. The highlight of the show is her harried but ultimately gorgeous version of ""Beauty and the Beast."" Hearing Stevie struggle triumphantly the the chorus of ""I never doubted your beauty..I've changed"" is moving."
5,MUST HAVE DVD,"JUST GOT DONE SEEING STEVIE IN TAMPA 2005 GOT THE LINK FROM HER WEBSITE, AMAZON AND FAST FOWARD ARE THE BEST LIKE I JUST GOT OFF LINE AND IT WAS HERE, ANY HOW, HOW PEOPLE CAN SAY NEGATIVE THINGS ABOUT THIS DVD, FROM THE JET TO THE CREDITS THIS IS THE BEST CONCERT DVD MADE, IF YOU KNOW ANYONE THATS A STEVIE NICKS FAN AND DON;T HAVE THIS ONE THEY WILL LOVE YOU FOR EVER, THANKS STEVIE THANKS AMAZON,WORTH EVERY PENNY, ANY ONE SAYING DIFFERENT ARE JUST HATERS, JUST CAN'T SAY ENOUGH, YOUR #1 FAN AND AMAZON 'YOU ROCK, LOVE TO SHOP AND ALWAYS SAFE AND FAST"
1,Is this the end of Nivea?,"If she continues to do music like this I would have to say so. It is no wonder you rarely hear anything from her these days. She has failed to produce a solid hit on this album and her material has definitely gone downhill. I thought her last album had a few decent cuts, but felt like if she worked with R. Kelly a little more he would be able to produce more good songs for her that really complimented her voice such as Laundromat. I really tried to give this cd a chance but there is nothing that catches my attention on here. I would really love to see Nivea do something great with her music career but this album has got to be one of the worst I have heard in the past few years. Hopefully, if she does another album she will really work with some people that can really bring that true singer out of her and show everyone what she has to offer the music industry."
3,WoW!,"This is a very large plug. I had a bit of difficulty getting it in and when it was in I felt every centimeter of it. Its too long in my opinion for daily wear. This product should mainly be used for sex play and then taken out. The base is also a bit too large, the corners tend to stab the buttocks. Definately not for beginners!"
5,good for starters,"if you brought the small slim-line butt-plug I bet it fell out a lot, this MED sized slim-line fits nice and snug ( will not just pop out). It will not take to much time to get your partner relaxed to get it in. Good for those who have started anal play and are not experts at it yet."
4,Think twice before you buy,"Made of smooth Vinyl, as medium sized one. The size has greatly increased so only serious user may think of buying"
4,Silicone nice to the touch...,"I bought it because my wife is pregnant and she has some hemorrhoid issues. I got the idea that since hemorrhoid pain is produced by the anus muscles strangling the inner side of the rectum that has protruded, then maybe she could used this small anal plug to push the rectum back into place thus allowing for the blood to flow normally and eliminating the pain... also, because even if the rectum couldn't be pushed into place permanently, she could also relax the anus muscles and increase its diameter thus reducing the strangling force it exerts on the protruding rectum...It actually worked, she applied it with some soap (soap seams to be very good helping retract the rectum) She used it a couple of nights and after work at home... in all she only used it for 3 days and she is now back to normal..."
3,"Sickening Odor, Uncomfortable Base","This plug suffers from a sickeningly sweet odor similar to that of a a grape Popsicle but overpowering. It does not go away with washing or with time. It is a medium not a large. The shape is good but the base stabs the sides of the buttocks after 5 minutes. The design needs to be improved to perhaps have a round base or longer ""tabs"" on this one. I will try another maker's product as recommended by another reviewer."
4,medium is not quite right,"The small is just too small and the medium is the only step up after. While this is a bit big, isnt big enough that some lube and gentle patience cant solve the problem. This was my first plug as I was experimenting a bit and have used one finger before. Again it is a bit big to shove in there as a first timer, but its actually doable with some lube and patience."
3,Too small,"I bought a medium and tried it twice and it seemed too large, so I bought the small. I was easy to insert and it came out just as easily. It had to be held in. So I inserted it for a few minutes and then tried the medium which I now could get in. Maybe it helped but I think if I had tried a little more with the medium I wouldn't have needed the small. It seems like the size difference between small and medium is too great. One half way between might be good."
3,A bit too wide for me,I ordered the medium sized plug and underestimated its size. WOW! with quite a bit of effort on my part I was able to get it in. It left me with a full feeling and was a little too big. Nevertheless it stayed in well and felt OK. I prefer my other toys over this one but its good for variation.
3,fast shipping,it's awsome but way bigger than i expected so it's just sitting in the back of the drawer lol.
2,Meh,"It works okay, but slides out of my partner very easily and seems to be low-quality material. Good for the cheap price though."
4,Accurate description,"I should have went with the medium size, but otherwise it is a great product, stays in place, satisfying, and easy to clean."
5,Large plug among the most comfortable,"DocJohnson medium and large are among the best plugs I have ever bought.I have purchased quite a number of plugs and the classic shape of these products are just very comfortable.One downturn is that the material DOES react when it comes in contact with other plastics. Further, this raises a concern about how healthy it is to wear this plug for longer periods of time (especially for 24/7 wearers)... If this is your goal, I would recommend silicone -- or, if you don't mind rigid anal toys: metal (a la Njoy toys) or glass."
5,our first,"We wanted to start slowly so this was our first ""little friend."" It's slender and short so neither of us was intimidated. My partner has had some experience with anal pleasure (thanks, dear) but this is new for me. Aside from the occasional digit at the doctor's, my bum was virgin. I have a feeling it will be a regular point of entry from now on."
2,Great while it lased,"Used it for about two months. Took a tiny bit of stretching to get it in, afterwards quite pleasurable. Felt great.BUTAfter a while I noticed air pockets inside, I could move them throughout the shell. I figured that there must have just been some air inside, no big deal. But after washing it, air bubbles turned into water bubbles and water started leaking from the bottom. When I examined the plug closely, I found that the seal at the base of the plug had opened up, making a gap between the harder outside shell and the soft inside filling, so now anything could get in between the layers through the hole. Not good.Disappointing, since it was brand new and I had only used it lightly."
4,"Nice and basic, as it should be","Having recieved it, along withBasix Slim 7"" Dong, FleshandDoc Johnson Enspiral Anal Plug, Black, I just tried out my new plug after researching for a while.Not only is it very pleasurable to use, but its made with Phthalate-Free PVC for cleaning was actually very easy. The material repels bacteria, so warm water and soap is all you need to be sure its sterile again after use.As for the product itself, it wasn't difficult at all to insert, which was unfortunate because I was hoping for something a little more challenging I suppose. However, the hard outer layer with the softer inner layer made for some interesting play and this is definitely a toy I'll continue to use."
4,Took a little work...,"Yes. The reviews are correct. This is rather large. Once it was in, however, it was great!"
4,bigger than looks,bigger then looks kinda hurt somewhat but good plug for what it is it cleans up nice she likes it
3,Medium?!,If this is a medium than I'm a bit terrified of what a large would be! I have to use this in the fron instead of the back because it's so large! Should've checked the dimensions
4,A little on the big side,"When I opened this, i kinda freaked out. It was HUGE. Tried it with my husband and needed quite a bit of lube, but once I was warmed up and ready for it, it went in with only a little extra effort. I'm fairly new to this so it might be easier for someone a little more experienced. If you're relatively new, I might recommend trying the small one first and not this medium one. Felt amazing though once I got used to it."
2,Not Quality,"I purchased this item and when I received it, it felt like the outside coating had separated from the inside filler material and gave it a somewhat lumpy feel and not so smooth and round. Still works/feels great just not exactly what I was expecting."
4,item as described,"I bought this for my naive wife,although we haven't used it yet I would rate it well.She has never explored a toy like this although I know she will on one of her naughty girl nights and want to try it.She never used a vibrator before I turned her bad,now she is a die hard fan of her Hitachi.So I suggest this for the box under the bed and see what happens,,"
1,Not for NEWBIES!!!,"I am a newbie cam girl, and I have been trying to become more open minded with the toys that I use in my web shows.I get a lot of requests for anal play so I decided to go ahead and buy anal beads. Those worked out great so I decided to upgrade to butt plugs. Little did I know the ""medium"" was so BIG!!!. It is as tall as a 12oz soda can and the tip is the width of a penny. But it gets thicker really quickly. I can not use this even with lube. So I will go a head and buy the ""small"" version. Not for beginners!!!"
2,"Kind of a pain, and not in a good way","This plug goes in very easily, insertable part is about 4 inches long and the diameter is about 1.5 inches, which isn't that big, but if you're not used to anything going up there, its perfect. If you have problems with fingers this would be good for you to work with, the tip is soft, but firm and you don't have to worry about it not coming back out.The bad part is the base of the plug, it has a angular build to it so its uncomfortable to have between your ass cheeks, even standing. I would prefer any sensation i have to come from my sphincter and not a chaffing feeling from between my ass cheeks.When i put it in, it slid in on the first try, and i could barely feel it so I'll probably upgrade to something bigger, hopefully something with a more comfortable base to it."
4,Not for beginners!,"My hubby & I have done some anal play in the past, so we wouldn't consider ourselves beginners. I wanted something a little more intense & something that would stay in. We looked at lots of different options & decided this was the best one for us. When I got the package, I was concerned that it was gonna be too big! There was a slight silicone smell when I first opened the package, but I don't notice anything now. I loved the weight & feel of the plug & was very excited to try it. I tried it by myself the first time to see how it felt. It took me a while, but I was able to insert it the whole way. I generally use some lube on it to help ease it in. I enjoy using this while my hubby & I have intercourse, but I do have problems with it coming out every once in a while. I don't recommend it for beginners, but someone could def work up to it!"
4,Me likey,Its a pretty big butt plug butt my female butt can handle it!! The base is a bit large for my small cheeks. I think its a Guy plug but was really cheap. So much butts!
2,ouch,I tried sticking it where it belongs in my partner and It hurt here. This is the medium/advanced plug. Will have to get a smaller one since she's a first timer.
1,worst product ever,ok so this is the worst product ever I'm a beginner virgin i stuck it in and it literally feel out and I'm VERY TIGHT its ridiculous your fingers are more pleasurable then this. now i need to purchase an order a new one andy need to get the medium
2,Size,"Just plain to big for me. If proper dimensions were given, I would never have purchased this. ""Medium""? For what....A cow? One look and I threw it out."
3,So-so,"Needs to come in bigger sizes (large actually wasn't large enough). Decided to use it with my boyfriend one night and it just wasn't big enough, kept falling out without provocation so it was totally ineffective for us. Possibly needs some sort of string or attachment in case it doesn't come back out."
1,wouldn't know,"Maybe I would have liked it, if it was what I ordered. but it was not. They sent me the wrong thing. I had ordered a large, white and got a small black. what's up with that. maybe cant read. has this every happened to you?"
5,I loved it,this is good it feels great and i highly recommend it to other adults who like butt plugs too. It definitely does well it is a great toy to satisfy your naughty needs :).
4,"nice, it explore the cliches of american and french people","quiet long descriptions along the book, they make a litle tiresome. But one can recover funny cliches about american and french people. The story is plenty of cultural missunderstandings. It was interesting."
4,Not So Picky,"As a mountain guide, I geuss I am more interested in the practical advice given in this book than whether it has enough slick style, perfect spelling, excellent grammar or impeccable editing. And really don't consider this book an excuse to ravage the Outside Magazine's style.I have been using the original ""Shape Of Your Life"" workout that appeared in Outside Magazine for about 2 years, and was happy to see this book update that workout and take it to the next level. While this version takes more time out of my day to workout than the old version, it also seems to be getting me in better physical condition. As Mr. Scott says the program is only an outline and after I finish the 24 weeks I will start combining the best of the original workout with this one to keep it interesting."
2,Disappointing for an Outside Mag. reader,"My wife got me Outside Fitness for Christmas knowing I enjoy the magazine and am working on getting back into shape.What she didn't realize is that I have actually been getting more and more disapointed in Outside magazine. Quality is slipping as they are trying to compete with various new ""mens""magazines none of which appeal to me.Well Outside Fitness is severely lacking too. It was a nice idea and could have been great. Also, this book like a previous reviewer has already said, could definitely use some heavy editing.Be nice if it were like the old Outside magazine - Be nicer if Outside Magazine were like its old self!"
3,Rogue of Gor,"OK, so I looked forward to ""Rogue of Gor"" as I found ""Fighting Slave of Gor"" to be somewhat interesting and entertaining. Minus, of course, the endless dialogue about natural biological tendencies, etc. This book could have been condensed to three or four chapters if Mr. Norman's dissertations on male dominance/female submission were removed. However, there was enough of a story told to pique my curiosity for the next book, ""Guardsman of Gor."" I am hopeful that there will be more ""story"" and less repetitiveness of what we all know is the author's focus of the books. We get it, Mr. Norman. Now help Jason get the lovely Miss Beverly Henderson back..."
3,"Whatcha Mean ""she can't be slave""?","One minute, Jason is saying that Miss Henderson can't be a slave, then he hopes that she is... but oh no, he can't think that way... but boy she'd sure look good on her knees, nude, serving him... But surely not Miss Henderson...Gimme a break ~ when he finds her, and buys her, she is thrilled that she will get to serve him; but he wants to set her free. She doesn't want to be free; he doesn't want her to be free & yet he treats her as tho she is free... which she isn't. He keeps her locked indoors, thereby making sure she is not really free: and by taking away her slavery, he makes sure she isn't truly free to be who she is.Too wishy-washy. I'll get the next in the series, just so that I've read them all, but honestly, I'm not that excited about it. Hopefully the next will be better than this one."
1,What a waste of my money!,"I love Z-Ro. He is one of my favorite artists. But this album is horrible and its not his fault. This is not a Rap-A-Lot release but a release from some no name label. It only features Z-Ro about 25% of the time and basicaly uses his name to showcase the labels artists. The production is horrible (multiple songs are filled with static, or overly bass heavy so you cant hear the words) and there are 3 instrumentals at the end. Also, there are 3 or 4 previously released Z-Ro songs that have been cut up and remixed to sound horrible. Unless you have every other Z-Ro album then do not buy this!!!"
1,Garbage,"The other reviewer was right, it's not The King Of The Ghetto's fault but its still garbage, and i wish someone would've told me before i wasted my money in the CD store. I enjoyed the dvd it came with tho so it wasn't a TOTAL waste. This album was released by some folks while Z-RO was incarcerated too."
5,a whole differnet world,harry potter has enchanted millions of readers from around the world and pulled the the children away from their television and showed them that reading is fun. read this if you want to see how far a child's imagination can carry him.
3,"Very Cute, but All the Interviews are Pretty Much the Same","This is a very cute book, and a quick read.Although the letters from the kids were sometimes adorable, the ""interview"" sections with some of the kids who wrote letters were all identical which was really tiresome. Surely the person who compiled all these letters could have thought of a few different questions for each kid.The letters were cute though... kids say the craziest things =)"
3,Not very impressive,"Not much to say on this one.One note on the HP movies; the elderly gentleman who played Albus Dumbledore was way better than the second guy. The first gentleman was a perfect actor for Albus, with kindness and strength. The 2nd guy is like some drunkard at a pub.Anyway, this book fell short of my expectations."
5,Harry at his best,The stories of enjoyment and excitment people have written about really struck my fancy. When the Harry Potter series first came out i thought 'Its just another kids book' but when my class was forced to read the first book Harry Potter and the philosephers stone i just had to get the rest of the series. I rate this book 100 out of 100.
4,Lack of consideration in packaging and release.,"I absolutely LOVE this show. I have to admit I am obsessed with it. So, like any other obsessed fan, I was anxiously awaiting the release of season 3. I couldn't wait to see the extras and all the special features. I was totally disgusted at the lack of effort that was put into releasing this awesome season 3. The show deserved much better and what about us, the fans? No special features, no minis, no 3 disc set. This is a 1 disc, front and back, season 3. I am obviously upset about that. With that being said, I am happy to have the episodes on disc now so I can watch them whenever I want. I gave this review four stars only because the show itself is fantastic. If I were rating it on everything else, it would get zero stars."
5,Okay but could be better,"The rating I give this set is for the episodes ONLY.After waiting so long for this season to come out on DVD I was excited to see it available to buy especially at the decent price compared to the two seasons before. Once I got the set though I could understand the pricing.The only thing on the DVD is the thirteen episodes. There is no on-the-sets, no minis, not even a special feature to view the performances on the own without watching the full episodes.All in all if you want to buy it so you can watch the episodes on your TV and not your computer go ahead. If you want special features and don't mind watching it on your home computer or laptop, try iTunes their download of season three has all the on-the-sets as shown on the N."
3,5 Stars for the Show... 3 for the DVD,"It's hard to give this long awaited DVD more than 3 stars. Thousands of fans anticipated the release of the 3rd season, the height of the entire series. This is the season when it became more than a teenage drama, a new and more mature story line began developing. Jude began writing stronger songs and discovered love triangle with the boy next door and the producer.This season is BEAUTIFUL. The release of the DVD was rushes though. There's nothing but 13 episodes on a dual disk. The disk lacks artwork. The DVD artwork is barely even good. The back tries to mimic S1 and S2, but fails.If Echo Bridge has any hopes of making more money, then they will release a bonus DVD with all the features this DVD lacked."
2,Cammogale what a disapointment,This blaster totally sucks! i only bouht it to play direct hit battle with mates and family. I hate this blaster so much it looks crap the stickers keep coming off (especially the teeth stickers i threw those away!)accuracy my foot!! it sucks!!! the rapid fire is the only decent thing i swear don't get this crappy b-daman you are better off gettin bakuso and rekuso.Oh yh the power of it's shots are unbelievablly weak!!only buy this toy if u have a power based b-daman to combine with. OVER ALL THIS B-DAMAN IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY IT IS BLOODY CRAP!!!
2,Ancient History,"I don't know why Tuttle persists in issuing this little dictionary. It is true that for a book of its size it contains a lot of entries. But the orthography is pre-World War II, and for the information of the uninitiated, a great deal changed after the war, from the number of characters used in the popular press to what is considered standard usage in furigana. Many of the usages in this dictionary are also aged, if not antiquated.As a result I have found this book to be not very useful, and I'd recommend the student interested in a romaji based Japanese-English dictionary to look at the Kodansha line of dictionaries instead."
5,fantastic game,this game is a great fighting game and it is easy to do i recomanded this game for kids 5-99 ignore the rating guide they dont know violence if it came out of there #####
3,Mega Man 8,"A fun but short game. Mega Man 8 has customizable upgrades, you can mix and match them for greatest efficiency. Fight your way past 8 main evil robots (just like in every Mega Man game) and crush the vile Dr. Wily. Anime and cut scenes add to the plot and fun. Good graphics, well worth the time and money."
4,I beat this game in two days!,"This game has a somewhat childish storyline. If you don't agree, go to the capcom website and read a review for it."
4,review,The megaman 8 game has awesome originals such aas doc. willy.it has decent graphics and is overall a blast. megaman could stand to have a bit more powerfull attacks though.
2,Flimsy,Looked good at first glance but after first use the seams were pulling apart. It may have been delivered in that condition but it was not noticed till after first outing.
3,All Purpose Blanket,The product doesn't look like much until you open its package.....the package is the blanket! It is 4' by 5'....not very large. Insulation is not thick so don't expect it to keep you warm in an Arctic environment. Polyester covering makes it rugged. It is good to keep in your vehicle for emergency use or as part of a FEMA 'Go Bag' (a kit you assemble in the event you must be evacuated in an emergency.)
5,Overlooked gem,"This might be Janis's least-known album, but it's one of her best. With its lyrics about the fading summer and going back to the city, it's perfect for the weeks just before Labor Day.It has a melancholy feel to it, but it probably won't leave you feeling depressed.If you can snag it, do so."
4,Bringing a basic veteran gamer review,"Now I never wrote a full review for any game and this would be the first..So please do not discriminate. That being said I have seen too many bad reviews for this game by AMATEUR writers. This game came out in PS1's prime,also something new for everybody since 96 I believe. This came out only a few months after RE1. (March-August) The graphics were not great obvious but for it's time it exceeded many feats. The sound and vocal casting sets the mood around every corner. An odd twisted story just getting more weird,a game where it takes more skill than brawn. The story is deep and part 2 only released overseas because of poor sales in the West. It never completed itself and it's story took many twists apart from this one. This is a great price for a classic ORIGINAL(because we don't get many of those now)factory sealed game. Pick up a copy and give it a chance,you won't be disappointed."
1,Read before buying!,"First off, I didn't actually purchase this game, I rented it...and let's just say that was a waste of $5.00. The game graphics are good, but the actual game play is boring, tedious and drawn-out. You start out awaking from a cryo-sleep and proceed to turn on the heat...do I need to go on? You soon find a robot sidekick that is just as annoying as the main character as you puzzle your way through couridors and hallways. It's alot of wandering around without much action...rent it first (and give yourself plenty of time to wander through the game) before you commit any more of your hard-earned cash...trust me on this one."
2,Well it has is goods points. Very few unfortionately.,"The game has a great concept and you can't go wrong with a Resident Evil style game, only they did. The only reson it got more than one star is because I love survival horror type games and I felt a little sorry. This game had potential to be a masterpiece."
3,Not quite what I was looking for,"I have purchased other manuals by Cox and thought this was the same. It is in no way as in depth as the manuals I have purchased in the past. I kept it, however because it does have some merit."
4,A good supplement,"I liked this book. By itself it is probably not the best book if you want to learn shamanic techniques. But it is a good supplement to any learning and practice of shamanism. It is more philosophy then practice, but there are some concrete ideas of how to develop your shamanic abilities."
2,Disappointed,The material makes too much noise. I've washed several times and made sure I used fabric softener but still makes the noise.
4,As advertised,"Good product. It fits the pillow well, and seems durable. We'll hope it helps with the allergy, but that is hard to determine."
2,Are u a deep sleeper?,O.k. I bought this type of product in the past but it was a COTTON material - it works perfect. I tried to save a few bucks and ordered this cheaper version and the first night I had it on it sounds like your sleeping on trash bags or newspapers like my girlfriend says.The product works as intended. Quality is good. Zipper is strong. But I just hope your a sound DEEP sleeper or you'll be awaken everytime you move your head. Just pay nearly double more for the COTTON version - I wish I had this time around!!
2,More like a paper cover...,"I was looking for more like a cotton-type or a fabric-like cover and this is more like paper. It crinkles loudly and isn't very comfortable to sleep on. I wanted the allergen barrier, but not like this!"
5,Keeps feathers in,"I bought this becuase after dry cleaning, our feather pillows constantly leaked feathers. These covers keep them in!"
2,Does NOT fit Cap neoprene dumbbells!!!,"Purchased this rack for the Cap 3/5/8 pound neoprene dumbbell set since all the reviews from that product said to get another rack since the cheap plastic rack collapses. This rack does not fit the width of the neoprene dumbells because it is too wide. This is for the big metal dumbbells, not for Mommy type dumbells."
1,Stinks,"This unit literally stinks, like the inside of a brand new cheap tire. When assembling it I had to open all the windows to keep the chemical-rubber fumes from knocking me out. Assembly was pretty straightforward, but all the nuts and bolts were coated with gross dark grease, with the result that the rack, my hands, my pants, and my nosy dog were all covered with black fingerprints by the time the job was done. Then, surprise! My dumbbells didn't fit in the slots! Truth be told, even if they did fit I'd be getting rid of this thing, since the nasty stench permeated not just the exercise room, but half the house, including the kitchen, where the family tends to look down on toxic fumes. Skip this model if you've got the chubby neoprene-coated dumbbells, even if you enjoy grease stains and huffing fumes."
1,horribe rack - keep looking,"Smells like latex rubber when you open it in October of 2011 - smells up the entire room. It was outright missing one of the black bottom rubber feet. Poor quality inspection at factory. Ding on one side of rack with white paint already chipping off. Box was undamaged so didnt happen during transport. Instructions are horribe - one small picture (I mean really small, like two inches tall) with a ton of small arrows pointing to parts of the rack with three cryptic sentences as your instructions. Sent back within 10 minutes of opening. Don't waste your time here - look elsewhere. Truly crap."
3,Works ok but is a little flimsy and smelly,"I went ahead and purchased this despite the prior review of it being smelly. It fit my budget and my needs (upright storage, preferred white coloring). The rack works well although the side panels flex a bit. With the weights in place, it seems OK. I have weights ranging from 10 lbs on the top to 35 lbs on the bottom. No issues with fit of the weights in the notch. After a full month, the smell still lingers, however. It comes from either the lubricant or the rubber inserts on the notches. The smell is getting weaker, but is still obvious when I walk in the room."
2,"Too wide for many dumbbells, and has the great eau-de-China","As others have pointed out, this rack boasts the great metal plastic smell that's characteristics of lots of industrial Chinese products. Can't imagine what it's like to live in some of those towns. I also agree with another reviewer that the nuts & bolts were filthy, but I don't expect otherwise. Just wear some surgical or neoprene gloves if you don't want to wash up afterwards.That aside, the main problem with this rack is that it's too wide for neoprene-covered weights, especially small ones. It fits my uncovered iron weights, and barely fits my adjustable ones.I noticed the price just significantly increased from what I paid. For the current price, I wouldn't have purchased it."
3,Functional but does smell,"I bought this rack for a small workout room. It is perfect to organize my 10-35lb hex dumbbells and takes up small amount of room. The rack is very stable which was key for our home as was concerned small kids could topple the rack over. The rack is solid so very doubtful this would happen. As previously mentioned though, the rack does have a strong and lingering smell of industrial plastic. This is clearly outgassing of the polymer material used as the smell is abating over the last weeks but it is still very annoying. I knocked off two stars to this rack for this issue. Will consider removing all plastic components from rack to see if stench goes away."
2,Okay Choice,"it works great at first. I thought i loved it and then after a while, it prints poorly. You try to clean the print heads and you waste half of your ink. And you can not just buy certain colors of ink, you have to buy an entire cartridge. The problem with that is, I tried to print pictures of my daughters soccer game, well at first it was great but then I ran out of green ink, but had plenty left of the other colors. So after that I had to be careful not to print picture with a lot of green until I could buy a new cartridge."
5,Africa Rocks Out=;-],"I have listened to this album since the 80's & it continues to be a true classic from its time in history. If you like upbeat danceable worldbeat music YOU WILL LOVE this music. Peace & Enjoy , Stephan"
2,It Makes No Sense,"We live in the 21st century and so I suppose it's inevitable we'll show our children some television. But this Baby Beethoven DVD is exactly what I don't want my baby watching. The ""program"" (if it deserves that name) runs about thirty minutes, and it's a medley of cheaply recorded classical music segments, each of which lasts just a few minutes at most. The visuals that accompany the music are disconnected not only from the music but from each other. Essentially, it's a half hour of footage of out-of-fashion toys and simple animations, and set to bad music. If you want your baby to listen to Beethoven, I think you're better off buying an actual Beethoven CD. If you want your baby to listen to Beethoven *and* watch something at the same time, buy Fantasia."
4,Key West Gardens And Their Stories,Key West is a tropical plant lovers paradise and this book is choke full of color photographs of some of the most fascinating gardens there. Not only is this book full of great photographs but there are many fascinating stories concerning the histories of the ground where the gardens now grow.If you like history and you like tropical plants this is the book for you. I also found many inspiring ideas for future landscaping and greenhouse design and I am sure you will too.
3,Explicit but not Erotic,"Lots of photos of gonads, but never coitus. Too many unnecessary excerpts with inappropriate language. Stats need to be updated - get the new edition."
3,End Of The Century Party [ECD],this cd is good and is what you can considder the beginning of Gary Clail his experimental face where he takes regae to another face. This cd is however the beginning of it all. On 04/06/1993 a better cd than this was release. The dreamstealers it is called. If you want to learn something about the evolution of regae according to Gary Clail you should buy this cd and Dreamstealers on top of it. However it seems that dreamstealers is so popular that is is not available anymore just anywhere you start looking but I can asure you that is is worth the look!
1,Good Price! Bad watch! is not WATER RESINSTANT!,"Well it all started at my sink, watching my hands after one day of using this watch, the next thing I observe, is drops of water inside the bezel area & dial, it sinks faster than the Titanic, c r o t o n = be careful for cheap watches!"
3,Where is the woman beneath the costume?,"""Tragic Muse"" will leave you with two regrets, albeit worthy ones: first, that her performances are lost to history; second, that you still don't have a grasp on her. This book is not meant so much as a biography as a recounting of Rachel as social and psychological phenomenon. It's an unusual and enjoyable approach, and Brownstein does a beautifully researched if nonlinear job of it. But while we're looking at the world's view of Rachel -- femme fatale, keeper of the antique flame, courtesan, child of Israel -- I'd enjoy more of a look at Rachel's view of herself. What were her letters really like? Why did so many men love her so well? What did she offer that the world in general did not have? There are lessons that could be learned from these answers; hopefully they too won't be lost to the ages."
4,Art,These pictures are amazing for decor when placed in a frame! They add a perfect sort of decoration to red and black decor!
3,Written on Water,I have read several books written by Eileen Chiang which I've enjoyed but this is not an easy book to understand. I believed it to be taken from her point of view on life in general. I will have to re-read it one day as I did not finish it.
4,Moody Science Classics - DVD,"The Moody Science Classics DVD set consists of 19 short presentations (about 30 minutes each) linking creation, science, and the Bible. One may critique the lack of eye catching modern visuals. It has a very 60's feel which some of us actually will like. What is important though is that there are numerous thought provoking moments that cannot be supplanted because of modern day superior technology. Visual ""wow's"" are great but this is mental food which an individual can chew on and help to obtain a personal world view that helps to integrate the world of science within the framework of the Bible. By the way, there is plenty of experimentation that Dr Moon does while he is speaking. This ensures that the viewers interest is maintained throughout the presentation. Whether you are a Christian or not I think these videos help one to appreciate the wonders of creation."
5,Tired of WASTING advertising money?,"Take your pick - you can spend 2-3 times as much on a big, fat book by a 5th Avenue ad exec ... or you can get practical, sensible advice than any business owner will find valuable. So much money is wasted on ads that are ""clever,"" often too clever for their own good. Here's a no-nonsense approach to making sure your ad dollars are maximized."
5,Want to become an advertising guru?,"You don't need an ad agency to be able to create effective ads.

Highly recommended for businesses new to advertising."
4,Nothing happens until something is sold,"This is an excellent training in the art of accomplishing the main objective. The author leads you away from advertising for the sake of advertising, for the sake of being witty or entertaining or for the sake of winning awards. You are taught to create ads that accomplish your real purpose, which is usually to sell your product or service. All of that seems like a no-brainer until you look at a lot of advertising. Small advertisers are often boring and large advertisers are so busy being cute that they miss the point. I watched the Aflac duck for a couple years and never knew what he wanted me to do. Finally when I read another book on advertising I found out they were after name recognition. They were tired of being such a large company that nobody had heard of. Not sure how that puts money back in the company piggy bank but I guess the ad did what they wanted it to do.Instant Advertising (Instant Success)"
3,Inconsistent,"This text, though very readable, teaches too much through example problems as opposed to actually explaining the information in the text. Presentation of some topics (chapter 6 particularly) was very poor. Some chapters were out of place (chapter 9 on differential equations, which should have been placed right before the last chapter)."
3,A guide for what not to do with an unfaithful lover,"In my opinion, the title is misleading. You think you will learn about the backstory to MJ's hit song ""Billie Jean."" Nope, she mentions the song and Micheal Jackson briefly. I don't even think she was obsessed, just misguided and angry.In the end the author acknowledges God, but if she would have done that in the beginning she would not have ended up with her life and her son's life on the line. This book is for women and men with low self esteem who find themselves in an one-sided relationship that you primarily lived out in his or her mind.God is good and his mercy endureth forever. I pray that God continues to protect this author, because her former lover could be released from prison."
1,havent gotten,I'm pissed because I haven't gotten it. I ordered it the first week in december and I still haven't gotten it.
1,Severe emotional issues,"Unfortunately, the author comes across to me as someone with some emotional issues. Though I believe that she may have met Michael once or twice, she has not proven that she was in a relationship with him, nor has she proven that he wrote Billie Jean about her as she claims. Though it is possible that they could have been sexual with each other, it is unlikely because I don't believe she was Michael's type."
1,"DO NOT BUY IT, not about mj at all","This book is not about Michael Jackson at all. Like millions of other people, this author uses his name to sell her book and make money. Need I say more?"
1,Trash and a waste of cash!,"DON'T read ANY sort of ""tell all"" and/or ""biography"" like these by ""former girlfriends"" or ""friends"" of Michael Jackson!It also includes biographers as well!PLEASE avoid reading books like this about Michael Jackson and other celebrities!They're meant to deceive, corrupt, and fool you!Keep away from books like this at ALL COSTS!"
1,Far fetched at best,"I too bought this book because of its link to Michael Jackson's life. I was rather surprised at the trauma and life experiences in this woman's life. It is hard to believe that this book is an actual account of the events of one woman's life. It is mainly about her strange abusive obession with a man who stayed present in her life for many years. The book was tagged as though it had a Michael Jackson connection, but her relationship to him was only mentioned in passing. The whole story seemed a bit far fetched."
2,It's not what its cracked up to be.,"The book provides you with cursory information and skims over specifics and details. It is not, in my opinion, a complete guide but more of a checklist or overview of special event management. In addition, there is not much to glean from the successful strategies that are showcased, because these too, are not indepth; the book does not really say how they were successful, just that they were successful. It is definitely not for someone doing research on entering this field."
2,This book is a simple introductory text on event management.,"This book is a simple introductory text on event management and will be of little use to those with any amount of experience in the field. At best, it will help the experienced manager refine their checklists. I expected much more from consultants of Ernst & Young."
1,This Game was Very Boring and Pointless,"This game, in my opinion, is terrible. The game had bad graphics, no realism, and is very dull. I was bored crazy when playing this game. I tried to enjoy it, but I could not. The game is somewhat confusing, it is a little bit awkward compared to other racing games, and I would definitely not recommend buying it. This is the worst game that I have ever played."
3,WOW...HMMM....WHERE TO BEGIN....???,"This movie was....well, it was SOMETHING. I really don't know if it was good or bad, or if I liked it or not. It had me all over the place. The stereotypical beginning of sex mixed with drugs bored me, but the idea of this man being imprisoned despite his pleas of innocence intrigued me, as did the therapy required of him for release. The land they find ""within"" the chair, however, bored me once again with too many cliches and just plain goofiness. I also hate the main character's narrated comments throughout the movie....let's leave that to the Wonder Years already and just ban them from movies! And boy, the ending.....geesh. First of all: I'm sick of rape being used so commonly in horror movies that are trying to be ""edgy"". Second of all: what?! What the hell was that past hour and a half all about?! So, to sum it all up: this movie has it's ups and it's downs, but it's worth watching - no matter how you feel at the end of it."
3,Really slow to start,"I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He's into horror and so I thought after reading the good reviews I would purchase this movie. Personally, I wanted it turned off after the first few minutes. It was just too slow for me. We have yet to watch the rest, so this isn't an accurate review of the rest of the movie, just a quick opinion."
1,nonsense at best,"I'll make this fairly brief. At least the first half of the movie attempted to have a story line and build some suspense. Particularly after that, once the cross over had begun this movie not only made no sense, it did so with a relish rarely seen before. This was a complete let down! On top of this ridiculous plot manipulation and confusion, the dialogue used to apparently make the movie rather unique, (if you could call it that), was profane, disgusting and actually is so clearly in your face as to Purposely INSULT the intelligence and motives of the viewer for watching it! One of the worse movies I've ever seen, honestly.This was a bloody MESS in more ways than one-my advice is-Don't Buy It, don't even rent this, you will regret seeing it, it is THAT EXTREMELY BAD!"
3,Not amazing but a disturbing horror for once!,"Ok, so I bought this on the whim from reading the other reviews on here. From what I read this sounded like a horror movie that I would enjoy. If I had rented it before buying it I would have not spent the money on this movie. This is a horror movie that does not really need to be in a horror collection. Although it was interesting and actually kind of disturbing, it just isnt a movie I would spend money on. But I own it now and so I have added it to my horror collection. There is a rape scene and that made me uncomfortable but other then that it was a very twisted movie. I did not expect the ending which was nice for a change from your average horror movie."
4,Good item. Good price.,The price is very good. [...]. Bought 2 for gift. The Calender setting is a little confusing. But with the instruction that's not a big problem. This is a wrist monitor. The cuff should be a little longer if a big guy want to use it.
4,"Good bargain for the price, works great.","It works. Consistent readings, light weight, great style and comes in a nice transparent plastic case. Will definitely work as a great gift idea."
5,"Value for the money product, still excellent","Absolutely no problem with the product so far, bought it for a person with a heart disease, so the equipment is used a couple of times a day.Used more than 8 months - excellent display and battery life, comes with a case."
4,MF-81 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor,"This product has turned out to be very accurate when compared to arm cuffs used in our doctor's office. It has also allowed my mother, who has weak veins and large arms, to monitor her pressure. Her arm cuff was usually hit or miss as to whether it would read correctly or at all due to arm size. Very pleased with purchase and price."
4,Great Idea!,"Easy to use, accurate. Beware of the battery compartment cover, very flimsy and easy to break."
2,Mark of Fitness MF-81 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor,Not accurate.Only reason to keeping is don't want to spend time for returning procedure.
1,This BP Machine is no good,"I bought this from amazon.com and this product sucks and it never gives acurate readings,the battery runs out with in no time...."
1,Waste of Money,I bought this monitor in March06 for my dearest in laws. The monitor stopped working after 3-4 months. They old me this product never displayed correct result. I am very much annoyed.
3,it works fine,I bought this product about 1 year ago. The numbers on the screen just disappeared recently. The company is willing to exchange this product but they will charge 7.95 for shipping and handling even the product is still in the warranty.
3,Inexpensive monitor,"This monitor was very inexpensive and unfortunately you get what you pay for. The instructions were hard to read and the display is also hard to read. The monitor seems to work and is easy to put on. If I were doing it again, I would have spent a few more dollars for a better quality cuff."
4,My little BP machine,"I have had this instrument for about 3 weeks and have found it very useful in monitoring my progress toward lowering my blood pressure. I have started a walking regimen and have noted a distinct improvement in my BP. Being able to observe the benefit of exercise on a daily basis provides an added incentive to continue slogging on. Nice little machine, well worth the money."
4,mark of fitness,After finding out that I had high blood pressure I needed something to monitor it. A friend offered his blood pressure machine to me and I tried it and it was just a lot of work with the pump that you had to pump up So I went out and found this product and compaired it with is and they were the same reading. and so much easy'er to use. I am glad I bought it
4,Value for money,This works well if used as instructed. The wrist should be parallel to heart and should be used in a stable state.. should not talk while using.
3,Working fine for me,"I have not faced any problems with the battery or accuracy so far like other reviewers, it is working fine for me."
3,reading inaccurate at times,The accuracy of this monitor is unreliable. Most of the times it gives correct reading. What it's good for though is it can tell when pressure is high or low but it you want something more accurate get the ones that come with a shoulder band.
4,Useful and Accurate,I have found the MF-81 BP monitor to be pretty accurate. I am in nursing school and I take it to clinical with me to compare it with readings on the hospital machines.. The memory function is great... and it's easy to operate.
1,Not Satisfied,Instrument is very inaccurate. Caused me to have my blood pressure checked by professional which confirmed the inaccuracy of this instrument.
5,Good stuff,"I bought this monitor and sent it to my Mum, who has high blood presure and was suggeted by the doctor to measure her blood presure everyday. She loved it, saying it was easy to use and the average blood presure she got with this monitor was almost the same as what she got in the clinic."
2,broken!!,"after less than 6 months, this product stopped working. i received an email from amazon that the product has had problems. i've emailed the company several times, but i've not received any response. PASS on this product/company."
1,DO NOT buy this one!,"I bought six of them as holiday gift for my elder relatives. However, unlike other amazon quality products, three of them turned out having screen display problem so I had to replace them by sending them back to Amazon. Although I received the new package by one-day free shipping, there is still one having the same problem. Now Amazon claimed that they are going to research the problem. Let's wait and see then."
1,Stopped working after using it less than 6 months,"I bought this product from Amazon and as other people have reported, this product stopped working after using it for less than 6 months. My recommendation would be to buy a wrist blood pressure monitor made by some other company."
2,"Not very accurate, but inexpensive.","I found this monitor to be way off in the readings it took when compared to those at the doctor's office. After reading many other reviews here it seems some other people got accurate readings so I might have had a faulty unit. The battery life of this unit is good and it also stores multiple readings for your future reference.I have since tried an arm cuff unit from OmronOmron Elite 7300W Womens Avanced Blood Pressure Monitorand I find that it gives me much more accurate readings and is very easy to use. However, it is more than double the price of this monitor. I find that arm cuff monitors are generally more accurate than the wrist monitors and personally I am not going back to a wrist monitor again."
2,Disappointed,The monitor did not give very accurate readings. I compared it to the one at the Doctor's office and it was way off.
1,Obscuring the message,"I cannot remember when I last read a book this badly written. After 100 pages of grimly determined reading, I finally gave up. It's a great shame since the author clearly knows a great deal about the machinations on the Hill and exposing some of our leagislators is a hugely important task. His overblown and purple prose style renders the book unreadable, however. Its hard to comment sensibly on the content since it so much obscured by his style. Shame."
1,Complete crap,"First off, the software, after installation, takes over 9 minutes to full load. On a P4 3.4MHZ system with 2gigs of fast RAM. (As a comparison, Vegas Video takes about 30 seconds)I thought to myself, oh well, so I'll use the software I like, Vegas or Premiere. NOPE! The analog inputs on this thing only work with Pinnacle software. So I've got a useless piece of junk unless I want to use their garbage bloatware.Sure, I tried to use it, but after seeing how many skipped frames I got in just the first minute of capture, I uninstalled everything.I'm returning it tomorrow."
1,Never again,I should have read the Amazon reviews before I bought this piece of garbage. It kept on crashing forcing me to reboot the computer
1,Avoid this company,"I bought 3 years ago Studio 10 PCI-700. I upgraded my OS to Win 7. The card is dead. The Pinnacle Website gives no clue, nor does it give new drivers. The company's ""contact us"" can be accessed only by fax - and cdoes not respond.So I lost $153 but got wiser. No more Pinnacle products."
2,bristles great handle terrible,let me first say at first I was thrilled with this brush i agreed with all the other reviews. Lathers great comfortable etc. After a month though of vary meticulous care the plastic handle cracked. I live in southern us in a extremely humid hot environment. I don't think this would occur in milder weather but something to consider for this type of environment. I will probably return and get a chrome handle brush.
4,Good quality brush,"Changing from shaving gel to the soap/brush combo was an eye-opener for me. Greatly reduced razor burn and a smoother shave followed quickly after my purchase of this product (and soap). This brush has served me well for quite some time, and builds and holds good lather.The only negative is that its included stand is nowhere near the quality of the brush...so if you want a good stand, you'll have to purchase one separately."
3,sizing is wrong,The tights are almost everything I was looking for. I bought them to use for layering in the cold months. They are a good thickness. I received them and opened the package (so they can no longer be returned) only to find that the 0-9 month is made for a toddler. My daughter won't be able to fit them until next winter. Overall it is a great product however buyer should take size difference into account when purchasing.
3,"Sizing is off, at least for small size (0-9m)","These seem like really nice tights, but they are so big! I ordered 0-9m, and I swear they would fit my 2yo. I ordered 3 pair - white, pink and hearts (listed separately) - and at first thought maybe they were mislabeled, but the other two were the same way. I'll hold onto them until my little girl can fit into them, but I'm disappointed she can't wear them sooner. Three stars for cuteness (especially the hearts) and apparent quality."
1,TOO LARGE,NOT as described for 0-9 months. They are sized for 18-24 months. Had to return. Would NOT RECOMMEND to anyone.
3,not 100% cotton,The tights are cute but not 100% cotton which was not mentioned in the description and I find important. They will serve the purpose.
3,Long,"I found these stockings to be too long when she was smaller, they started fitting right only around 7-8 months (27-28in height)."
3,Most recent order not a 2-4T,"We have ordered the Luvable Friends tights twice. They are a great heavy weight and really well made (hence the three stars). The white color is also holding up despite playing in the mud and dirt. My daughter wears them with her school uniform. The first set we ordered has made it through at least 10 wears and washes. They still look good and are holding their shape. The second order has the same quality as the first, but the sizing is all wrong. The label reads 28-38 lbs. My daughter is only a 3T and 31 lbs. These tights are about 3-4 inches too short for her. The rise (from the crotch to the waist) is very short and even when I stretch them and pull them up they do not offer full coverage. Seems like it might be hit or miss on getting the correct size."
3,looks like it will work,"sturdy made rack, but a little small on the size, screwed into tree fairly easy, should work to put the necassary items"
3,"NICE ATLAS, CUT-THROAT PRICE","The biggest obstacle in the way of this beautifully illustrated atlas is its rather unreasonable price-tag. Its publisher, (and authors), did overlook the fact that there are lots of moderately priced equivalents out there in the market.Nevertheless, anyone who goes ahead and purchase this atlas will appreciate its versatile accomplishments. It is very practical, and included high resolution photographs and micrographs.""Atlas of Human Parasitology"" has a unique organization, which enabled it to provide comprehensive laboratory information. Every specimen it portrayed was labelled and analyzed in details. There is complementary taxonomical description in each case. This is a well-compiled atlas, but I still maintain that its price is a great barrier."
1,Back Order Surprise,Ordered on the 21st of March......placed in back-ordered status the 23rd.....due April 1st.....Should have gone to Home DepotShop elsewhere
5,History At Its Best,"This historical novel is well written, historically accurate, well researched and extremely enjoyable to read. The journal foremat that this novel employs allows the reader to cover several journal entries, then put the book aside and pick it up again in a day or two and not lose the narrative of the story.The book touches on the institution of slavery as viewed by a Southern gentleman as well as from the view point of the slave. The book shows the horror of slavery and the horror of war. Yet there is also another side to this excellent book. There are many journal entries that show the humerous side of camp and army life. This book does pay homage to the General who lead the Southern charge at Gettysburg.I think General Pettigrew would have enjoyed reading this fictional journal of his life. As a former history teacher I strongly recommend this book!"
5,Simply wonderful,Opening the bag of Monks Blend tea revealed a pungent and pleasant aroma. I never thought I would use these words together. I was just about to give up on black tea until I tried this. It has a great taste and aroma. I wouldn't add anythinjg to the tea after brewing. It's great just the way it is. I am going to make Paper Street my new preferred supplier of tea.
5,1st graders love this book,My first grade student love to hear me read the poems in this book and then show them the amazing art work. This book is almost always chosen by someone during free read time. My favorite is the poem about how to grow poems in your mind.
4,"Very cool idea, gameplay a little frustrating","This game has great graphics and has some great improvements over other fighting games in the area of realism. For example, it has the notion of ""critical hits"" that just kill you automatically. There are no ""power bars"". However, it was hard to stay interested in it for long because there wasn't a good skill level ramp as with other games."
5,I Finally Quit!,"I was able to quit smoking with this gum. I was 2-pack/day smoker for 40+ years and found the gum tastes good and the nicotine was enough to take the edge off those cravings. I had tried several other methods to quit, but the gum was the only one that worked. I'm happily a non-smoker now."
2,"Good product, if not expired.",I bought one box from Amazon and it had expired three months before I received it. The second box I received was expired as well. I would say order at your own risk although Amazon was good with the returns.
2,Nicorette,Works to curb craving HOWEVER the coating on the gum is quite hard and the gum gets stiff. I prefer the 'store brand' version. The gum is longer lasting and the texture is better.
4,worth while,"I was a bit skeptical when trying this product, however upon actually using it for a couple weeks now, I see that it actually works.However, it doesn't make quitting smoke a breeze, but it certainly helps overcome cravings. It's just important to read the instructions of how frequently and one should chew the gum as well as HOW one chews it, because I originally made the mistake of chewing it like regular gum and nearly made myself ill.All in all, quitting smoking is tough and to my surprise Nicorette actually makes it seem possible."
3,Nicorette,"I have stopped smoking with the help of this product, but, unfortunately, I am hooked on this product; however, better than smoking....."
2,BUYER BEWARE,"WHEN I RECEIVED THE PACKAGE I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THE EXPIRATION DATE OF 09/2013. I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT IT. HOWEVER, THE GUM TASTE STALE. DOES NOT HAVE THAT PEPPERY TASTE TO IT THAT LETS YOU KNOW THE NICOTINE IS BEING RELEASED. I'VE USED THE GUM BEFORE. STORE BOUGHT AND IT GOT ME TO QUITE FOR 4 YEARS. IT IMMEDIATELY HAD THAT PEPPERY TASTE AND STOPED THE CRAVINGS. THIS GUM DOES NOT STOP THE CRAVING IN THE SAME WAY. I'M NOT SURE IT DOES ANYTHING AT ALL. I'M DEBATING WHETHER OR NOT TO CALL AMAZON IN AN EFFORT TO GET MY MONEY BACK. I WOULD ADVISE PEOPLE TO BUY IT DIRECT FROM THE STORE."
1,Waste of money,This purchase was a complete waste. The product must have been old. Every piece of gum was stuck to the packing and impossible to pull free. I had to throw away the entire box.
2,WARNING - WRONG IMAGE! NO 20 EXTRA PIECES!,WARNING: They have the wrong image! The product does NOT have 20 extra pieces like the image says. This product is only 100 pieces. Don't be duped.
3,Expensive,"Too expensive. Wondering why this product has to be so costly. It's certainly not the taxes which is mostly the case with cigarettes,"
2,Not for me,"I've tried everything under the sun to quit, patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, everything. Nothing worked for me. The only thing that worked for me after 10 years of smoking was the electronic cigarette. I've been cancer stick free now for more than a year.Electronic cigarettes and personal vaporizers are definitely top notch in my book. I've saved thousands of dollars in my year now as an e-cig smoker. All the effects of smoking that damaged my body making me cough and unable to taste or breathe properly are gone but I bet I've saved even more money because I refilled my cartridges instead of purchasing new cartridges each time they've gone dry. I also purchased my starter kit for a great price. The company I buy from is fast, affordable and always answers any questions I have, I really recommend them and I've been a happy customer. FreshSmoking, one word, google them. You'll be surprised how easy it is to stop smoking normal cigarettes. Your wallet will thank you too!"
1,Didn't receive item I ordered,"I ordered the item pictured here (green with face on lower right hand corner)nicorette gum 2mg. What I received, after paying high shipping costs was item 14 instead. I've called Amazon 2x and am still waiting for a response. This is a disappointment, and I hope they can ship me the item I ordered, and refund me for the incorrect item."
1,Forget it!,"I don't drink hard liquor anymore, so surely i'm not an alcoholic.Does the statement above make any sense?Smoking is addiction to nicotine. Using nicotine to quit only makes it harder.I'll recommend that you Buy Allen Carr's book or attend one of his courses.I did and I stopped promptly without withdrawal symptoms worth talking about.Don't jump to conclusions. I was a heavy smoker and I am an alcoholic sober 11 years. I'm not an easy case and you're not different!PS: I wonder if the tobacco companies are the owner of the Nicorette company?"
5,Rockers Delight,This album is great and Augustus rips up the heavy beats with his Melodica I would definitly recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys the ROCKERS era! Peace one blood!
3,Could be better,"This one is not as solid & thorough as the previous edition on asp.net 1.1, some deficiencies include:- page life cycle is rather poorly explained, MSDN documentation does a better job- only covers the website model, not the 1.1 style web project model, which is a shame, as many professional sites don't use the web site model (which btw really sucks)- page compilation is poorly covered, this actually changed a lot between 1.1 & 2.0, but as the author chose to write this book as an addon to the earlier edition, the explanation of this topic is rather sketchy.- web parts: didnt get to bottom of how proxywebpartmanager is different from the normal webpartmanager. again, MSDN online arctles provide a clearer explanation.all in all, i get the impression this book is somehow rushed to market."
3,"Good content, but dissapointing release process","This book inherits from the Essential ASP book. If you don't have that book, it's like trying to create an inherited class without any documentation or source for the base class. This book requires the reader to have the Essential ASP book and to do a mental merge (vtable?), where some chapters come from ASP.NET and others come from ASP.NET 2.0. I would have preferred a 2nd edition that merged all of the current content into a single book."
1,Not for VB.Net programmers,"I purchased the book several months ago. All the code example in the book are in C#. The preface promises that VB versions of the code can be found at the cited web site. A few moths ago, the web site stated the samples would be available by 30 November. They weren't. The site now says they'll be there by 31 December. That date has come and gone, and still no VB code examples."
4,The Way We Were,"What's insanely great about ""Dot"" is the chilling reality factor; unlike Christopher Guest's ""mockumentary"" marvels, you never get the feeling that these characters are anything less than the creepy people who used to live down the hall in your dorm. The late 90s were just like the late 60s: a remarkable cataclysm when the lunatics took over the asylum and every lunatic fantasy was not only permitted, it was funded by venture capitalist who were equally deluded, if not outright 'luded, too. The only nit is the plot; you know from the start how the story ends, but the ride is so real, you can practically taste the imported Cuban sugar in the overpriced coffee. But I knew too many people who seriously considered asking Alan Greenspan to be on their advisory board, and more importantly, placed the call. And had it returned."
3,Lots of features for the price - Video is not great,"At full sun light and highest res. setting, the color is vibrant (red is a bit over saturated); at low light the video quality is horrible. Accept under bright light, it was much worse than my 10+ years old Sony. For some reason, I kept forgeting to turn the dial to off position - drained the battery.I returned the camera for something better."
2,Average Camera,"I took this camera on an extensive European vacation recently. I tryed out the various functions prior to the trip and was ready to return it but it was to complicated to get a fix on a return price. I found during my trip that the disc's just don't hold enough when you record in the best quality (22 minutes). A major problem was the camera accidentally turning itself on. I had the camera around my neck and several times, it turned itself on by rubbing against my chest. I found that you have to be very careful to record a steady picture especially if you want to zoom in on a subject, a tripod would be very helpful. The size of the camera is nice but it complicates your life having to use Small disc's and HDD and putting them together for one project. The Hybrid is a good idea but not so easy to use unless you are a techi so I only give it a two star rating."
4,Hitachi DZHS300A Hybrid Camcorder,"Good image quality in bright light, but gets grainy pretty quickly as light decreases. Good sound quality. Good battery life. Easy to record to either DVD or HDD. Would be better if there was a shuttle or slow-mo function to capture stills from video. Doesn't really replace a regular digital still camera since it doesn't have a flash. I like that I could unpack it and be using it in a minute or less (except for initial charging the battery). The eyepiece is pretty useless since it's so close to the main body of the camera, but the LCD screen is good. Simple controls (there are only 20 or so buttons on the whole camera) are OK, but some of the functions I'd like to have quick and easy access to (like switching from standard screen to wide screen) are buried in menus."
4,Nice camcorder,"It's a nice camcorder. I bought it in Aug, and took it to Japan & China, it was great! Good video quality, most time I used mini-DVD disc, when I playback it has some stops but if use its software to transfer to PC, everything is OK. I'm happy with this camcorder. By the way, only one thing is not good. If you use it to take still picture the result will be terrible. But I need digital camcorder, not camera!"
3,Reliable and good feature but brook in less than a year,"Reliable and good feature but brook in less than a year; I bought the camera at the end of 2007; and the inside transistor got burn, according to the warranty Tech, but it's fixable..... maybe I had a bad apple??"
3,Good for those without sophisticated audio needs,"The picture quality is good, and the camcorder is easy to use. There are challenges, however, when using a DVD-RW in obtaining synch'ed sound/picture and direct capturing audio with picture to a Mac (PC compatibility seems fine). This model also does NOT have an external microphone jack (there is such a jack on the DZ-HS303A model). The internal mic audio quality is good, but not satisfactory for more sophisticated needs."
2,Dr. Wayne forgot that this CD should teach some good !,"I really liked Dr. Wayne dyers 101 ways CD but this CD collection is out of focus. After spending 6 hours on this CD , I could not figure out his message !!..It seems Dr. Wayne forgot that readers/listeners should get some advise when they hear this. He gave many examples and cases but some of them are really weak examples and weird and not upto his point at all.Dr.Wayne , We love your CD's but this collection is waste of money.. Dr. Wayne, why r u fooling us ?I am dropping Wayne Dyer from my collection as it seems he coming with more and more BS, repeated same talks and trying to Immitate Deepak Chopra. Sad but True."
2,Birder Feedback,I found the book disappointing. Think it would be good for a novice. Much information for a novice taking up birdwatching but repetitive for a seasoned birder. The type is poorly done and hard to read. The promised secrets to attracting birds may well be in this book but one would have to read cover to cover to find them! I wold not recommend.
2,Um.... Ah.... Um.... Ah....,"Um, the content is, ah, pretty good, but, um, Dr. Dyer really needs to, ah, improve on his, um, ah, public speaking."
5,Wayne Dyer is fantastic,The information contained in these CD's is fantastic. I honestly believe it should be a required couse of study in high school or at least a copy should be in every home. Not only is the information Wayne Dyer delivers profound but his way of communication is excellant. Buy this collection and you will not be let down.
1,Don't purchase from these people,"Not only did I not ever receive the product, I emailed them twice looking for an update and they never even bothered to answer me. I wouldn't purchase anything from these people!"
1,Bad purchase,"I do not recommend it, the day that came the mouse I stop working, the retractable cables of several elements are damaged by facility.Him escribi to the seller on the hurt of the mouse and never me respondio."
4,The Great Return of Tomba,"If you love the original Tomba from Whoopee Camp, you'll love this more!!And if you think that this is a 3D game, you're incorrect because this is only a 2D platform game but it offers a lot of colorful graphics and delightful, humorous characters..There are more puzzles to conquer and more ""treasures"" to find..To beat the game, you have to finish the events, find some crystals, which'll add to Tomba's AP total..It may make you dizzy but the act of playing is worth it."
3,"Good, but the original is better","This was a fun game and some of the puzzles were really tough. However, I found that they attempted to make the game easier for kids by adding spoken dialog.(hint- TURN THE VOCAL DIALOG OFF if you don't want to be annoyed!- there are 3 people who do ALL the voices, and they don't try to hide it very well) Another thing I found annoying was the music- anytime you came to the start of a new challenge, the music became VERY dramatic(drama-queenish)and then suddly reverts to a very subdued backtrack.Overall, it's a fun game, the graphics are good, but TOMBA, the original game is MUCH better, and lasted a lot longer."
1,"Ok, but dumb at times","If your looking for a great sequel to a great game, this isn't it. While it may have some of original gameplay, you could hardly call it a sequel. the puzzles are harder (which i like.)but the controls and plot suck. COLLECTING GOLDEN CRABS?!?! WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?!?! AND, WHATS WITH THE SUITS?! it was FINE as it was. so, get it if you liked the first one, get it for the sake of being a TOMBA! fan. otherwise, forget it."
4,Tomba 2 Rocks the House all night long,Tomba is incredible in the fact that there are so many things that you can do in it and there are a lot of cool things to find.
3,Everybody likes Tomba,I don't see games like this anymore where the characters speak as they do. This is one of those classic games that appeal to collectors.
1,Be careful,"Be careful reading this book. I found the author to be racist. He speaks poorly of jews and blacks. In many ways, feels like hatred. He writes that immigrants from the caribbean basin or south and central america should be restricted from entering usa. Immigrants from europe, more specifically, northern europe...caucasians(male) should be allowed to immigrate. In his view, this would make usa a better country. I bought this book to find out more about the Illuminati, but after reading this book I'm not sure if what I've read is true. Instead of just stating the facts about the Illuminati,Mr.Krieg was biased in his writings. I will be purchasing another book about the Illuminati. I would've rather a refund, but I threw the book in the trash."
4,I put it at my pillow,I read it often before I am going to sleep. It let me relax and feel sleepy. I like it
2,Outdated and boring jokes of the era.,This book will amuse only the golden aged veterans who can kick back on their toastmaster era of old jokes and very corny stories. Modern day story tellers will wince at this before dozing off to a fitful sleep.
1,Outdated jokes in archaic language,"I'll never again order a book without noting the date of publication. Even by 1965, the author must have been putting Rotarians to sleep for three decades with these old-guy knee slappers. This book is mustier than your grandma's attic"
2,Washed Up,"Robin Lee Graham really swallowed the anchor. He is now a very religious dude far from the sea. This book is all about him finding GOD, and I don't really think it has anything to do with sailing, except that a sailor, retired, wrote it!"
5,a tree for me,"I am an art critic and curator. This book is a delightful poem with incantatory repetitions that kids love. The illustrations are enchanting -- witty, engaging, and wonderfully colored. Samton's images add another layer of meaning to van Laan's amusing rhymes. Both text and illustrations stand up to repeated reading and close looking."
5,Great price,I have bought this at a local pet shop for my koi. The fish do well on this product and I just found it is also sold through Amazon for about 30% less.
2,Clouds water,My water was cloudy within a week of using this food. It falls apart as soon as it hits the water and makes a horrible mess.
4,"OK product, tripod alone is worth the price!","Purchased this product from a Home-Center after working with two other carpenters that had purchased them. They liked having them available based upon the affordability.It needs to be set up and used with caution but seems to be accurate and is great for occasional use.It switches between plumb or level laser lines. The level w/laser can be used while detached from the tripod. It comes in a yellow plastic kit storage box. Laser was powerful and uses small AA type batteries.I used it after after dark once on the exterior of a building to plumb columns under a second floor deck. It was very helpful and accuracy seemed to be confirmed by checking with 4 foot level, etc.I would recommend purchasing it for occasional homeowner type usage especially since the tripod alone is worth the price."
4,Great Game,"This is a very good game, centered around military strategy. Along the lines of Dune 2000, or C&C. You build military facilities and research technologies which allow you to build military units. As you discover new technologies, you can incorporate them into military units utilizing the ""Design"" phase of the game. This allows you to factor in and modify such concerns as cost, time-to-build, strength, intended targets, and speed. This also allows you to personalize your army in a way the C&C does not. My only hang up with the game is that it is hard to tell individual unit types apart on the main screen, and some of the controls don't work quite as should, such as selecting and labeling a group of units for control."
3,Probably the best strategy game around but...,...the time limit sucks. Most missions require you to finish it in just 2 hours. This is quite impossible specially in the earlier part of the game (particularly mission 6) since you still need to fortify your base because the intelligent hi-tech enemy troops attack relentlessly. I would rate this game 5 stars if they had included an option to play the game with no time limit.
2,Unfair and Inaccurate,"The actress portraying PM Margaret Thatcher took this series which began on a high note to a two star rating. The Thatcher portray was factually inaccurate at times, portrayed her as a whimpering, whinning incompetant. She was called The Iron Lady for a reason. The Left always tries to demonize their opponents, Thatcher was no friend of the Left."
3,The heavy burden of royalty.,Episode 1 was really interesting to me as I was too young at the time to really understand the issues. QEII had to make difficult decisions balancing the heavy mantle of the throne with the love for her sister. She certainly chose duty before all else.
4,Very Interesting,"I was concerned that having so many actresses play the same part, even if at different ages, would be distracting, but it isn't at all. Enjoyed watching this very much."
3,On the boring side.,"I would have much rather this been a mini series and not a documentary hybrid. Also I found it very distracting how unlike the real people the actors were, aside from Leslie Manville playing the Queen, and the woman playing Camilla Parker Bowles. It just didn't hold my interest."
3,Nothing Like Live Theatre,Live Theatre is chemistry between the audience and the actorsVery evident in this DVD.
3,"A decent version of COMPANY, but far from its greatest","This new version of COMPANY is the first widely-available recording of the show, and that in and of itself holds a certain level of appeal. I always appreciate the opportunity to snatch up recordings of some of my favorite shows.Sadly, this isn't my favorite version of COMPANY. While the staging is inventive in concept (to an extent... this was also done with the revival of SWEENEY TODD), this isn't the lively, fun version that I grew to love. The set is sparse and cold, and a lot of the portrayals carry the same aura.And despite all the acclaim, I just don't like Raul Esparza. For a guy who's supposed to be nice and fun, but emotionally shut off, he's far too internalized and far too intense. It's an oddly misguided performance, and it feels quite inappropriate given all the things we hear about his character.Still, it's well worth a look."
4,Very well done,If you like Sondheim you will like this. This version is very sophisticated and well performed. There is not a character I did not enjoy. I have never seen the actors singing and playing the instruments but I found it fascinating and not at all distracting. I would give it 5 stars but I never give 5 stars unless perfect. This is close.
5,Different but good.,"I have seen this play many times, on stage and on Public TV. This is a good adaptation and the cast does an excellent job with it. Some may have trouble with the lack of true ""set"" as it is all played on one large platform in the middle of the audience. But all the charm of the show still comes through with the excellent portrayals by the cast. I love that the cast is also the orchestra and chorus."
4,Like being in the front row,I love Company and always have. Great muic. Great story. I generally am not crazy about filmed theatrical pieces but this is perfect. You feel like you are onstage with the cast and the voices and acting are top rate. Big thumbs up
4,Almost works!,"I have never seen this show performed live, but I wore out the original cast recording on vinyl and CD. I missed the full orchestrations, but having the cast play instruments was fun and worked well most of the time. I also thought Raul Esparza gave a very intriguing performance. My guess is it was a bit darker than Dean Jones or Larry Kert. Being Alive did not work for me - too screamy, as was Ladies Who Lunch. All in all, I prefer the performance of Company in my head, with Dean Jones and Elaine Stritch. I do think some of the dialogue is a bit stilted, but those songs - it doesn't get much better."
2,theater in a theater,"It is not easy for everybody to attend a Broadway show. This video, recorded at a theater -sometimes you can even see the audience- is a unique experience. I loved it because I felt as if I was in the theater. And the actors - singers - musicians are simply terrific! Don't miss it if you love musical theater"
2,Company....not very much company,"I read the reviews before purchasing and feel I should havenot bought it because they were so accurate. I didn'tcare for the dvd. I quit watching the video 1/2 through.The singers are great, but the play is cynical and notuplifting at all."
4,Amazing Concept,Where do you find performers who can sing and act and play multiple instruments proficiently enough to execute a difficut score like Company and be believable? It's a remarkable achievement.
4,Excellent blu ray with a couple of flaws,"This is an excellent disc, with a couple of flaws.I think the absence of subtitles is particularly important here, because the singers' diction, while very good, is not as absolutely clear as it might be, or as it is on the original cast recording of COMPANY. And of course Sondheim's lyrics are tricky enough that at some point almost everyone is going to need subtitles to follow them.Another reviewer has already mentioned a certain overintensity in the lead performer. I didn't notice that, but the singer who does ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" is overintense indeed. This is her decision, and the song is so famous for its mordancy that I can hardly blame her for overplaying its bitterness, but I think a touch of humor would have made the song better, and that finally it collapses under the extreme self-importance she imparts to it.If the other critic and I are both right, this entire production suffers a little from its exaggerated seriousness."
4,Interesting commentary on marriage in the modern world,"This movie was a very interesting and funny portrayal of the loneliness and decision making process that everyone goes through in their 30s. Should you get married just because all of your friends are? Is it ok to be single throughout life? Are you just refusing to grow up if you don't get married? These questions aren't really answered in this movie, but it portrays them in a humorous way while making the audience think about these important questions. It may make you laugh and cry at the same time. This was a very good movie and I would recommend it to anyone young or old!"
5,Great performance,This is one of the best play I have ever seen and this cast is extremely talented! The end left me and my daughter in tears. As a fan of Stephen Sondheim works this is a must have! Highly recommended!Teresa
4,Great Performance indeed!,"This is a great musical, and is absolutely hilarious. This is the only performance of it that I have seen, but I would love to see more. The performance & staging bring heart to the play. The voices & acting of the cast are remarkable. I love that they played their own instruments. The depictions of the various realities of marriage & relationships demonstrate the genius of Sondheim. The comedy serves to bring the points home in a pretty impactful way.The songs & acting leave you in awe of the talent of the cast. Perhaps my favorite song was ""Sorry, Grateful"", though there wasn't a single song that I disliked. Most I absolutely loved.This is the performance broadcast by PBS, for those who may be wondering."
1,Non-captioned,"As a deaf person, I will not be able to hear this film, but will give it to my son. I'm very sad because I missed the original and the revival on Broadway. Forgive me for giving what may be a wonderful film (how can I know) one star, because it is inaccessible to all deaf and hard of hearing people. We will gladly pay a few bucks more to support Closed Captioning."
4,"'Company,' the Broadway musical",Price was right. Product came on time. I have not had the chance to view it
1,Company,"I saw this on PBS (?) and hardly recognized the show. It was very dismal.When is this greatest of shows going to be made into a film that captures the original? Why must people think they have to update or modernizethis show? Having been 14 at the time of the OBC, I related to this score completly as an awkwardly and severly Catholic teen. The show helped me grow up, cope and open my eyes to an ironically real world that escaped Bobby. I could not go to New York to see it and my family would have ben horrified. This ""production"" was a circus act in the genre of ""believe it or not."" I am sory I watchd it and wish I could forget it permanently.Will someone do this show proud and produce a film version that captures the original? After all, it is touted as one of the greatest shows and thre are hundreds of millions of people who have not seen it. You think?"
3,Disappointing,"Really, enough already with the cast doubling as the orchestra. It does NOT work. It didnt work with Sweeney Todd, and it doesnt work with this production. The cast does a marvelous job of singing, but it is all lost in the ""marching band"" parade, spending their non-spotlight moments circling the center stage like they were on an endless catwalk toting saxophones and basses. The story and characterization is lost in the distraction of the staging. After a long wait for a DVD version of a ""Company"" production, this is not much more than a ""Company IN CONCERT"" rendition of a musical much more deserving of a better production. Until sopranos can sing from their posteriors because they are busy playing the flute and tenors can act despite having to carry a clarinet for the entire performance, stagings of this type shoudn't be given a second glance."
3,"Hmmm...Fun, but not great","The main problem with this game is that it has too little chartacters. Maybe i'm just cynical, but after playing the 3rd Toshiden it's sorta pointless. There aren't enough characters and it is waaaaaaay too easy to beat. The last boss, whose name i will leave as X, is really rather dumb. If you wanna buy one of this series, buy the 3rd. It has many more characters and moves, and the special moves are cooler. the last boss is much harder, too."
3,high priced for it's value,"Although a good book as such, this title to me does not live up to the high expectations anyone would have from Hasselblad related products. Many different cameratypes are being dealt with, non of them in depth, to my opinion. Hardly any technical information on the camera's is supplied, and I feel that anyone buying a separate owner's manual and a book which covers his/her particular field of interest would be better off. Excellent photos and illustrations, though."
1,Irrelevant to the contemporary cameras,"The author clearly understands that the book is for the cameras of 6 or more years old.I own H4D-31, that is not covered with the book."
3,Informative but Touting the Company Line,"The book is pretty informative in explaining the Hasselblad world. However some of his recommendations given with no rational (Example - he does not recommend using thrid party dark slide keepers for older film backs, but does not say why.) which leads one to think that he is just parotting the company line.Every single photo example is of his own photos. It would be more ueful to see a variety of diefferent photographers' work."
4,good beginner set,Bought this for a Christmas present for a close friend. She toldd me she had just bought a set from another store. I will be giving this to a relative who is just beginning their own home.
1,NOT induction,"The light gauge steel used for these cheap pots is slightly magnetic which the induction cooktop detects as incompatible and errs. Everything about these pots is cheap, very thin steel, thin glass top and lousy handles. Don't waste your money!!"
1,crappy plastic handles,"this is a nice set EXCEPT the handles are made of the cheapest plastic available! They haven't even lasted six months without breaking off, especially on the frying pan. unacceptable. buy something more durable elsewhere."
2,Not Much for the Money,"The beads and charms are nice enough, but for the price you get very little with this kit -- only about 50 tiny glass beads and 50 spacers, plus the charms. There's nothing here special enough to justify spending the money -- there are plenty of nicer jewelry kits out there that are more generous with the supplies."
5,GREAT GAME! Unique and a classic!,"Skull Monkeys is so different than your average platform game as it is entirely done in claymation! As a fan of the Odd World series, we were eager to see how this game rated, since they were both made by the same people. Its just as funny and creative and has its own unique look...any true game fan should own this! Its also quite rare, so if you can find a copy of it, GRAB it!"
5,Furby fanatic!,This toy is so much fun!! I bought this for my 2 year old daughter and had to by me one too (I'm 22). Much better than the old version.
3,Fail safe?,"This book would probably be a useful resource for administrators and other school leaders who are seeking to implement literacy coaching in their schools. The resource wasn't designed as a guide for coaches themselves, but I still learned a few things about building a literacy team and found it an interesting read. One caveat: I found the use of the term 'fail-safe literacy' rather off-putting: I don't like the implication that there any practices or approaches that are fail-safe, and I'm not sure it's an appropriate goal for a coaching program. However, fail-safe is a term that would likely appeal to school leaders, and that's the target audience here, so, well-played, I suppose."
3,"Overpriced, but fits as advertised","$6 for an iron rod with a bit of shape and a couple holes punched in the ends is well over an order of magnitude too high. That's Mid-Atlantic, though.OTH, the bar is exactly what it promises to be without any of the minor and sometimes extremely irritating tolerance issues when mixing and matching rack-mount products between vendors."
4,The WWII Air War from every angle,"Although I originally read this book in researching International Law pertaining to the application of Air Power, I discovered a wealth of information. This book presents a miriad of ideas and perceptions, from very notable authors, on just about every possible aspect of the Air War(s) of World War II.A must for the researcher or WWII history buff."
4,Great Price for the value,This smart cycle bike is very funny for children to ride and the games that they have to go with it are very good and helps to motivate the child to be both active and educated at the same time.
4,Very active 4 y.o.,My son has very much enjoyed this smart cycle and cartridge. He loves running over the letters and numbers. This is a good letter recognition tool while also being a great outlet for his never ending energy.
5,Too small for me.,My 3 year old grandson loves the bike We bought for Christmas but it's too small for me. Also I have bad knees. It hasn't broken but it's too soon to tell how sturdy it is but it looks well made.Hoping there is no lead paint on it but as he won't grow up smart like Granpa.PS Sharon is my wifes name.
4,I bought tomba used.,... When I bought the game I expected the whole game what I got was just a demo tape. I was very upset when I found out. Sellers should let people know if a game is a demo or not before buying. ...I love to play Tomba but I will be more careful when buying anything from the market place sellers. So buyer beware what you are buying used from the market place sellers. thank you.
5,pointless,The price is ridiculous considering the story line isnt all that long.I've played and beat this game numerous times growing up.However i would never pay that much for a game on playstation 1
5,Just What I Had Hoped For,"This book was recommended to me by a friend who does a lot of hiking in all sorts of places. She said it was the best book she could find for a person looking for hiking trails in the Palm Springs area. Since my wife and I have recently begun visting the Palm Springs/Joshua Tree area, I quickly ordered the book from amazon.com, paying several dollars less for the book than did my friend, who paid full price for her copy in a Palm Desert bookstore.The book is excellent. The directions to the trails, and the descriptions of the trails are complete and easy to understand. The level of difficulty and time required to complete each hike is clearly explained. The book is very informative and was an excellent buy."
1,The only Garbage of its type available,"True this is the only resource around that offers a snippet on many hikes in the area, but the descriptions are riddles with vague information. Example: A hike that had a page description said, ""after a while you will come to a wide wash.."" That while was hours and miles later. I suffered heat stroke because of this book. I am not alone. ALL the avid hikers i know are aware that the descriptions contained within the book are pretty awful. I hope someone else can create a better book. Maybe me!"
2,Be careful of directions!,"This book definitely motivates and excites you to hike the Coachella Valley and surroundings, however, be very careful with the directions given. I have tried 3 hikes from the book and 2 we were lost for quite some time. Your best bet is to mapquest the directions or certainly call ahead. The author really could have done better in this area as your interested in hiking not driving!!"
1,darn,"I'm afraid this book falls short of it's title. Maps are often out of scale, inverted and in this day and age of iphone ease, this printed version falls far short. Trail heads are not marked nearly well enough in the 'back of napkin' maps. There is no pull out grand map. There is no associated CD. Save your money and go grab a $7 chart from the Santa Rosa and St Jacinto Mountains Information Center on Hwy 74 to learn of trail locations and scaled charts."
3,"Good read, but too short.","I read this book in a day, but I stayed up late to finish it. Set about 1990, it is the story of a man's journey from Havana to Miami on an inner tube. The story is descriptive and informative. I stopped a few times to google certain words or ideas to get a better idea of the subject. If I have a complaint, it would be that the book is too narrow. I wish the author would've expanded his writing to paint a broader picture, make things clearer for me. Maybe he'll write it again in Julia Alvarez fashion. Good to read; I'm giving it to my teenaged son, next."
3,"Empty story good for action scenes, continuity","'Acts of War' is a pretty empty Star Wars read. The Jedi pretty much get messed up with a race of violent aliens and the comic turns into one big fight after another as the Jedi intervene. One reviewer was right in the fact that the Jedi - normally peaceloving and fighters only when need be - step way out of character and pretty much act trigger happy. A few positives about this book is the artwork, which is nice and clean, and the fact that it nicely fits into the Prequel era, seguing right into the next book, 'Prelude to Rebellion'. For Star Wars continuity buffs only."
1,MK RIP OFF!,This game serves no other point than to rip off Mortal Combat and its very cheaply done too. There's no tutorial! There's no moves list my cousin and I played 2 player on this game for 5 minutes before throwing it on the ground! It Sucks So BAD! Everything that makes a fighting game good is not present in the least bit!
3,set,angela's ashes was a depressing book which was well written and spellbinding- a true gem. You constantly are flipping back to the dedication page to see if the children survived. The movie doesn't do it justice. Tis was a disappointment to me because i couldn't get an emotional attachment to frank's story until the final chapter.
2,Not stable when stacked,"I ordered three of these trays (as well as three letter-sized trays) to help my husband organize his home office. I was looking for something a little sturdier than the plastic trays, but not quite as expensive as those made of wood. When our order arrived a few of the trays were warped and did not stack well at all. The grooves did not line up and they balanced--precariously--on top of each other. I am certain that with any kind of daily use the upper trays would often end up collapsing onto the lower trays. We will likely be returning all of them, unless my husband decides he wants to try to bend them back into shape. I would definitely not recommend these for anything other than single tray use. In retrospect, paying twice as much for the wooden trays would have been the wise choice."
4,Deserves more than 2 stars.,"I'd agree that the design of the Sparco trays ensures slightly more secure ""nesting,"" but a combination of notches plus gravity allows the user to stack the Rolodex trays with practically the same degree of stability. Given the discrepancy between Amazon Prime's prices for the Rolodex vs. those of sub-vendors, I'd make price the primary determinant in choice of a wire mesh tray. (The plastic models, even at half the price, inevitably disappoint--unless they self-destruct first.)"
3,Not disappointed,"I purchased this video mainly because I have a small role in it which of course colors my feelings somewhat. I didn't know it had been released and when I learned it was available, I found it on Amazon and bought it. It's a nice movie, a small independent, it's enjoyable if you're not expecting the next Oscar winner."
4,Windows 2000 server by Simmons,"Very straight-forward and to the point. If you are looking for a highly technical book then you may want to wait for other titles to hit the shelves. As an MCSE having worked with NT 4.0, I needed an overview of Windows 2000 server. This book answers the superficial questions ""where is this located now"" or ""how do I configure this option or protocol"" and what the heck are forests and trees! I'm sure I will purchase more in-depth books as the release of Windows 2000 server nears, however, this book is a leisurely look at this new OS and that's exactly what I had expected out of it."
5,First rate,"For G&C fans this is a great buy. You may not have heard them, but the two albums on this twofer are excellent. They have all the elements of the pair's best work: beautifully crafted pop, humor, exquisite vocals, exceptional musicianship, knockout production, and eccentric (but not pretentious) experimentation. There are some nice bonuses, including the single ""Welcome to Breakfast Television,"" and a stirring remix of ""Snack Attack."" I can't imagine that fans of G&C wouldn't like this CD, and you never know when this music will become permanently unavailable. Snap it up while you can."
2,This is not what I was expecting...,"When I heard that Dogz was coming out with a new and 'updated' version of the original game, I went out and bought it for my pc, along with the new version of Catz. However, what I found was that while the graphics are much better than the old versions, there is really nothing to do with your petz. You can no longer have petz running around together, there is not any way to grow your puppy/kitten to an adult, no breeding the animals,(your Catz and Dogz can't interface either) and not even the toys were better....if you can't play fetch with it, the pet just chews on it. It is a little like The Sims, in that you have a bar that shows the status of your pet, but you don't work very hard to keep it up. Other than competing in talent shows and buying things...this game is BORING. Unless you have a small child who can actually spend time teaching a virtual animal tricks, I would not recommend this game."
2,Damnit,"I would rate it a 2/5. It is much like nintendogs with a mix of the game that was only released in Japan (The Dog: Happy Life). It is quite repetative and there are only 5 breeds in the game. Nothing to unlock, only talent (obedience) shows and no walks. So I would say that if you really liked dogs, get it, but if they're so/so, then don't even bother. The graphics in the game are very good though.i would rate it higher if there was more to do. once you get rich and get all the items, there is pretty much nothing to do. the tricks get annoying and even if the dog knows the tricks very well, when you need it to do the trick. most often, if will not do it. but even though it is annoying, it still gets you addicted if you like dogs, that is, and if you have a pretty big attention span. i got rich and everything within 2 days (and hour each day). i gave up. my friend has the game and it works withought a CD so i have it on my computer."
3,"A well paced adventure with a splash of emotion, Well done!","This story is the epitomy of every runner's life. Not only does the SR team have to deal with all the heat breathing down their necks, they have real personal problems as well. Odom does an outstanding job portraying the carachters as ""real,"" and their handling of every situation as if their lives depended on it (because they usualy do) kept me turning the pages."
3,Shadowrun's alive,"In my opinion, Headhunters is quite a good book since the author manages to make the runners have personal problems and still have them look like professionals. What I didn't like, however, were the conversations between Skater and Archangel - these are not the kind of conversations that any real person would actually deal in. Apart from that, Headhunters is certainly one of the Shadowrun books that creates the most atmosphere."
4,"my girlfriend and I listen to this cd, now she is pregnant.","georges attic is the quintescential conception tool. It is a mechanism of cerebral bliss. It shows us what the moral terptitude of society should incorporate into its thread of moralistic bombastatory platitude. In other words, It rocks dude."
3,Funny Paranormal Stories with a Holiday Twist,"This anthology contains four longer stories rather than five or more shorter ones. I think that's a good idea because it gives the authors more room to work.The stand-out story is ""The Shepherds & Mr. Weisman"" by Anne Kimberlin. Old cars, a lovable dog, and the celestial Mrs. Epiphania work their magic.The second best story was ""The Yuletide Spirit"" by Kathleen Nance. It's about -- of all things -- a sexy Yuletide elf!The stories by Emma Craig and Stobie Piel are not as successful, but still fun and charming.I gave this anthology a total of C+ at All About Romance."
4,Nice wallet but does not match picture exactly,Very nice wallet but it does not exactly match the picture. The ID flap folds from the top of the wallet not the middle as shown in the picture. I ordered one and notified Amazon it was wrong (but my son wanted it so he kept it) and re-ordered. I received the wrong wallet again so I guess the picture is of an older style
3,Not so slimmy,I felt it is little small wallet and when it holds 5 cards it is too thick. At all it is good wallet.
4,It really grew on me.,"This wallet is great. I didn't know if I made a good decision right when I ordered it- it is smaller than my last wallet and was a bit more expensive. However it really grew on me as I carried it around. It really is slim and allows for very easy access to all of my stuff. Its a little tough to get the ID out of the wallet, but other than that it is a decent wallet."
4,It's good,"It looks good, and touches soft and smooth. The only drawback is that the wallet's size is not big enough to place notes( Chinese Yuan)."
4,A little on the small side,"I ordered this on August 24 and received it a week later, givin that I live in Alaska it got here very fast, so shipping was excellent. When I opened the envelope it came in and pulled the tin out I immediately noticed that it was a lot smaller than I thought it was. Now when I read slim that registered in my mind as more flat than other wallets. Bills fit fine in its designated pocket. Credit cards however have a VERY tight fit. The clear I.D. flap is not removable and also hugs the card very tight. It has a total of 8 credit card slots. The leather however if very fine and smoother than any wallet I've had before, very high quality material. It fits very comfortably in my back pocket and I haven't noticed it there unless I've been sitting for more than an hour. If you're looking for a smaller wallet and you don't mind the cards coming and going with some stress than I would most definitely recommend this product."
5,perfect fit,"I got this wallet very quickly, and it is very thin. It does hold a lot of cards and a decent amount of cash. My RFID pass works while still in it, but my CTA pass doesn't? Not sure why that is, but other than that it's been awesome. I would highly recommend it."
4,slim with lots of pockets,This wallet is thin and hardly noticable in my pocket. It has a ton of card slots (I can imagine filling each one will make it not as thin). the leather seems very nice. It was a good buy for a great price.
2,hardly slim,Too many layers of leather. Once you put 5-6 cards in it it's hardly slim any more.Nice quality but not as advertised imho.
4,to shallow,"Nice wallet, my husband wanted something less bulky and was not into the front pocket wallets. This is definitely slim but it is not wide enough, money and receipts hang out of the bill fold compartment because they are too tall. It could be slim and wide, not sure why they made it so short. So if you don't carry much cash or don't keep receipts in the wallet it should be fine."
1,crap,this was a gift for my fiance and its a piece of crap. its very nice looking and slim.... until everything starts ripping. i dont reccomend this to anybody.
3,"great wallet, but a little bit deceptive","I bought this as a wallet to take on vacation in Europe, i.e., something where I could put only my bare essentials and they would be held well in place and if I lost it I wouldn't be out of everything. When I saw ""slim"" I expected it to be ""thin"" - but it was actually a little thicker than expected, and actually the word I would use is ""narrow"". You see, the wallet isn't large enough to hold several of the Euro's denominations. It holds dollars fine (they're all the same size) but 20-Euro notes and up stick out uncomfortably. Aside from that, it's a great wallet, and in fact I now use it as my main wallet!"
2,too small,"Never order a wallet sight unseen. This looked good in the ad, but I never would have bought it had I been able to exmine it before buying. It is too small to hold much of anything."
3,"Good wallet, but also with some problems","First of all, I need to say that it's a well-designed wallet and the size fits my pocket. The surface feels smooth and it's comfortable to handle. However, I have to say it also contains a series of problems, although not big, really affecting the experience.1.Some slots for cards are a bit smaller than cards, or just the same size. Such minor difference makes cards difficult to be put in and taken out.2.The inner side of the wallet will become sticky after being put in the pocket for some time.3.The wallet is slim as I see it, but it is designed just a little wider than the notes, which means you can still see the notes inside while it is closed.Anyway, the wallet worths the money. But it could be better if those can be improved."
4,"GOOD FOR THE PRICE, BUT BETTER CHOICE, READ REVIEW","It took me over 40 years to find a good quality leather wallet that was at a fair and reasonable cost. I purchased the Geoffrey Beene Men's Passcase Billfold at the Navy exchange in Japan for about $15.00 back in 2005. I also purchased one for my son, both were black.I saw the Geoffrey Beene Men's Mirage Slim Passcase Wallet and decided to try it out thinking it would be the same quality. It was, but I actually needed a wallet that could do even more than the one I had. I needed to fit a large medical alert card inside it and it would not fit, but it did not fit in my initial wallet either.Comparing both Geoffrey Beane wallets I chose to stay with the Geoffrey Beene Men's Passcase Billfold and plan to purchase one in Brown (Wish they had it in Burgundy)for $21.99."
5,Slim and smooth,"The leather feels very nice and it is such a nice slim size with plenty of places for cards, etc."
5,wallet,Was purchased for my son for his birthday. He loved it and I like to shop online. It is so easy.
4,Sturdy wallet,"The leather is very soft and smooth. It is rather slim, which is perfect for what my husband wanted. It has many compartments and can accommodate many cards. The slots are a bit tight, but should loosen up with use. The best part is that the ""insert"" where ID cards go is attached to the wallet! This portion is not in danger of falling out of the wallet and losing the contents thereof. We expect the wallet to last a while."
4,Found by mistake..,"I found this album/band while looking for another song. They have a pretty kickin' sound. Some lyrics are a little trite, but for the most part it's good tunes."
3,This one was not very good,"I took one look at the DVD cover with the picture of Jet Li on it and then looked at the price and I was hooked on buying it. I should have read the descriptions of the product first. There are 4 films on one disk, 1 is about the various shaolin styles, and there are a lot of them. The monkey and drunken styles are just plain silly, the rest are ok. If you are planning on becoming a martial arts master this one might interest you. The documentary on the life of Jet Li growing up did not interest me. The other two films Shaolin Temple 1 and 2 were 1980 films and they showed their age. Real old films. I would pass on this one. But, for the real kung Fu fans you can't go wrong on the price."
4,Bionicle Series not just a toy promotion,"At first glance, a skeptical parent would think the various bionicle book series were just a promotional idea of the Lego company to sell more figures and sets. However, I've been sold... on the stories. I have enjoyed the action packed tales as much as my seven year old son has - we both have been excited for the release of not just the new bionicle toys, but the the next books in the series as well. There is a rich background to these assemblages of plastic that will feed your child's imagination during creative play and will foster their interest in reading. Definitly recommend!"
1,Listen to the people,"I'm sorry I bought this game. I finished the game in 5 minutes.Not funny at all. Too easy puzzles. AND most of all you die too fast. First time I played this game it was hard to learn the controlles, once I figured them out it was as easy as slam dunking on a 1 ft. basket ball goal.SAVE YOUR MONEY"
1,Way too short!,"Ok, I have to say, I was excited about getting this game! Got it home and played it for about 10 minutes...then bam, that's the end of the game! Way too short. This game is probably meant for kindergarten age group. I was highly disappointed. The graphics and colorization of the game was of high quality though...a few laughs here and there too..but that's it. I mean really...10 minutes?? Don't waste your money. If you are curious about it now, just rent it. Enough said."
3,Understanding,"I agree with all of you who are knocking this and other Playstation Tiny Toons games. Heh, I f you want to yell at anyone, yell at Warner Bros. They always had a problem when it came to ages with this show. Not just with the characters themselves (being 11-13 and being put in situations that 5-8 year olds would be in) but their aim at the target audience (with merchandise) was always way off."
3,"Great Playing, Weak Lyrics","I think that the musicianship is spectacular. Better or more meaningful lyrics could put them over the top. If ROCK stayed in this mode only, it might have died. These guys have the talent to bring it back to the front where it belongs. If Rock is dead then so am I. Rock and Rock Nurse aren't going away. Let Blast Room lead the way. ROCK ON!!!"
2,Kinda Slow,"I Kept Hearing All Of The Buz About This Book, So Throught Id Be The Judge Of It Myself.For Me Personally, It Didnt Hold My Attention Very Much..I Throught That It Would Be Better.If You Are Curious About It, Find Out If A Friend Has It & Just Borrow It."
2,Poor writing style,"Our group reviewed this book in our April 2004 meeting. The key question that the group raised was `How was the minister (Leon) so popular in Newark, and Kiyah did not know that he was married?' The group felt that Kiyah was very infatuated with the minister's money & power because she was so used to spending her own money on her (ex)husband. Where did Kiyah lose the power? - Kiyah made herself too available every time Leon called upon her. And she especially had sex with him too soon.The group came to the agreement that Leon (minister) treated what he did like a business. He felt that his preaching the word deserved recognition. The group agreed not to be fooled by the man behind the cloth. Leon was there to deliver the word but he would have to face his own judgment day. The book does portray the negative side of pastors.All in all the group felt the book did not remain consistent, was not too informative and the author had a poor writing style."
1,Redundancy at its Best,"After hearing all the hype surrounding this novel I was looking forward to an enjoyable satisfying read. The catchy title and storyline added to my curiosity. Oddly enough, by the time I reached page 15, all interest had dissipated.The redundancies were so annoying and unnecessary I couldn't stand it any more.[...] Things were reiterated every few sentences: 'So, getting back to Liberation Day', 'But let me get back to this cool, crisp summer day', 'Anyway back to the shopping trip'. All that between pages 14 and 15!! Needless to say it was quite a task to complete, but I finally did. The main charactar, Kiyah Simmons, was written to be so foolishly blind to obvious things, that she turned out to be just as annoying as the elementary writing style of this book."
5,Had No Idea This Was Going On in the Church!,"'Ministers with White Collars and Black Secrets'absolutely blew my mind. I've never read a Christian novel before, and I'm glad I chose this one as my first. It was excellent. I went through it in two days and couldn't wait to get my hands on the sequel. I would like to thank Deborah Smith for exposing some of her 'secrets' and I would also like to give a shout out to one of the main characters, the Great Pastor Leon Booker. (Read the book for more info!)"
2,What an obvious secret,I got this book because I really wanted to read Robbed Without a Gun. Well I am so glad I didn't buy them both. Not to be mean and take away from Ms. Smiths' ability to create. The story just went around and around in circles and never said anything interesting. Actually it gave me a headache. I didn't complete the story I could not get pass all the designer name dropping and the fact that she just didnt seem to have much commen sense.I gave this story 2 stars for the author's efforts.
1,Certainly amongst the worst books I have ever read,All books by this famous author are amongst the worst books I have ever read
2,"Great book, horrible Kindle implementation","A gritty noir thriller in a distopian England... but a badly botched Kindle implementation. Numerous passages are out of order in the kindle version, leading to a confusing read... although I've seen this a couple of times with other kindle titles this is by far the worst I have encountered. You can get through it if you persevere but do yourself a favor and read the paper version. Tor should be ashamed of themseleves for this sloppy quality control."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"In an England that has gone security made after some computer terrorism, everything is watched and banned. Yes, it is creepier if you look at it now.However, a web-cam type porn star still managed to do her thing, and also to catch her own murder on video.A middle-aged police inspector gets involved with wanting to solve the case, and finds it leads disturbing places."
4,none,"Electrifying and shocking, (McAuley's) WHOLE WIDE WORLD is a terrific blend of John Grisham, Tom Clancy, and Orwell's 1984. One of the best suspense SF novels around! Gary S. Potter Author/Poet"
5,Great Book,I loved this book so much. It is one of my favorites in the Animal Ark book series. In the book Mandy and her best friend James have to find a missing animal star named Charley. You'll have to find out what happens in the book by reading it.
4,Book Review by Jalyn,"People don't really care about this dog, except Mandy. She always did. Then the dog goes missing. Everyone goes missing. Will they find her, Reader?I think this book is perfect for dog lovers. I know I liked it. This book is very heart warming."
1,Bad design,"We bought these to replace plastic Malibu lights that had lasted for many years but were starting to show their age. We thought that by buying the metal lamps they would last even longer. The two problems that I have with the lamps are the plastic clips to connect them to the wires are very difficult to pierce the wire and the clips can come lose.But my biggest complaint is that the cylinder is separate from the base and screws onto it with little ""nubs"". These nubs have a tendency to break off if bumped by a foot, ball, lawnmower or even heavy snow. Once these have broken off the lights will no longer stay on the base and fall off.We bought 2 of these systems for our back and front yards. After only a couple years they are almost all broken. I would recommend looking at a different model."
5,nice lights,"i ordered 5 of the lights. the price on amazon was very reasonablecompared to lowes and it was free shipping--what's not to like?the lights are well made out of metal. they are much higher qualitythan the inexpensive plastic ones. installation is very straightforward. if your 12 volt line is in place, all you do is squeeze the wiring prongs together, push the stakes in the ground, and wah-lah!"
5,Great lights,"I've had these lights installed in New England, lots of bad weather, for the past year and a half. The first set of bulbs burnt out rather quickly. Replacements from Lowes or Home Depot have lasted much longer. These have withstood the elements very well. No fading, cracking etc. One does have a small dent in the top, probably where a tree brach fell on it in a storm, but the paint was not damaged. All metal construction with solid glass. Tried an LED version first but they were dim compared to these."
4,Pathway Lighting,"I've been using these lights in my back yard for about ten years. They're attractive and provide subtle lighting along the walkways. I have two concerns about them, however. As in all of the Malibu lights, the provided connection clips often tend to come loose from the feeder wire over time. I've chosen to hard wire all of my lamps. The other annoyance is that the base connection to the tubular part of the lamp will corrode in a few years, making bulb replacement virtually impossible. But generally, I find them attractive and reliable."
1,Outrageous!,"We purchased two sets of these a few years ago. The bulbs are so fragile and burn out so quickly, it is impossible to keep up with them. They are difficult to find in the retail stores and the price can be anywhere between $6 and $9 EACH! Another problem is that ants find them to be attractive homes. They fill the cylinders up with sand which eventually blocks all light from reaching the top of the fixture. It then becomes necessary to take the fixture apart to clean it out and then replace it ~ hoping that you don't blow the bulb in the process. Don't waste your money and always check the cost of the replacement bulbs before buying any set of outdoor fixtures."
3,one light came used!,"I ordered 6 of these lights, 5 were new in the box, but the 6th one had dirt stuck to the bottom and a broken socket where the bulb should have been! I guess the good deal I got wasn't so good since I paid for 6 and only got 5."
5,love it,Great DVD. I highly recommend this for those who love chimpanzees. It shows a lot of old footage of when she first arrived.
3,Too Preachy,"Pretty good primate documentary. Cool parts include black and white footage of a young Jane Goodall interacting with the same chimps she visits now. [Weak] parts include the obligatory guilt-inducing checkbook-opening ""don't let us go extinct"" chapter at the end. Complete with Goodall lecturing a racially mixed class of schoolchildren about conservation. I'm not against racially mixed classes of schoolchildren, and I'm not against saving the apes, but I watch movies to escape rather than be reminded of reality.There are lots and lots of cute chimps playing (with a really cool baboon/chimp playing together section), but not too much in the way of science. This may be what you want, of course."
2,Pirates of the Carolinas,"Terrance Zepke has a lively writing style and the visual layout of the book is outstanding. Unfortunately, this does not carry over to the information presented in the book which in places is totally incorrect. Mr. Zepke's research leaves a lot to be desired. The book is written more for entertainment rather than factal accuracy and should be viewed as such by any potential reader. Good starting point for a person casually interested in reading about the Carolina Pirates during the Golden Age of Piracy but the information presented should not be taken at face value."
4,Good Introduction to Pirates,"""Pirates of the Carolinas"" is a good title for anyone with a very basic knowledge of pirates. Having lived in North Carolina and with a young son very interested in pirates, I had to read the title.Zepke covers basic information on the following pirates:1. Blackbeard2. Anne Bonny3. Calico Jack Rackham4. Mary Read5. William Fly6. Henry Avery7. William Lewis8. Stede Bonnet9. Thomas Tew10. Richard Worley11. Charles Vane12. William Kidd13. John RedfieldEach chapter typically includes the person's life before becoming a pirate, why they became a pirate, adventures, and usually; a brutal end.A good basic book to orient you to the subject of pirates in the Carolinas."
5,Gundam with heart (pt 2),"The second collection of Gundam Seed picks up where the first left off. It takes the series and characters to a new level. I couldn't stop watching these two collections and I watchedGundam Seed Destiny Anime Legends, Vol. 1in less than 4 days because of how intriguing the characters and universe are. If you are a fan of Gundam, I encourage you to see how this wonderful series has grown in the new millenium."
5,best price in the world for the best guitar strings in the world,"These are pure nickel heavy gauge electric strings, and in my 20 years of playing i must say they are the best! these strings aren't for your tap happy speed metal feather fingered ""let me see how many notes i can play in 20 seconds"" kind of players. these are for players who actually care about what their guitar sounds like, instead of how many notes per second it can play. just my opinion... but i'd rather hear hendrix, or gilmour or trower play one note than listen to vai or satriani play a million.This seller is great, fast delivery, great price, can't beat it!"
5,Excellent study!!!,"I am well above the recommended age range, but I have found this to be one of the best Bible studies I've ever done. Thoughtful and insightful, without being ""cute"" or condescending to its young readers. A serious and enjoyable study for girls who want to grow in their faith. It does help to read the first two of the NEW Elsie books, as excerpts are key to the lessons. The OLD series, while covering essentially the same stories, does so at a different pace and the book numbers don't line up. I can't wait to get the other studies (Millie's and Violet's)."
4,Great Imagination from new author,Take a look at this new author. What a great imagination in the writing and the story is one that will hold on to you waiting to see what will happen next. I hope this author will continue to grow and use his imagination and put out more in the future.
3,"Melodic New Age with ""rock"" elements",If you enjoy New Age e-music that won't put you to sleep or bore you to death with an overload of synth noodling then try this.
1,Complete Junk,"I replaced my 1 3/4 hp milwaukee with this larger model as I already had all the accessories. It has laasted a year and a half with the last 6 months it being stuck on a medium speed with no adjustment. It has performed moderate shop work but nothing more than the previous smaller model did which lasted around 3 years- also not very acceptable. The switches also give trouble, I think they are dust related as they would begin working again as quickly as they would stop?"
3,Nutone 672R Fan,"Bought this as a replacement for same model which died after only 5 years. I just used the motor and fan and the new grill as it was a direct replacement. Already sounding funny, maybe not such a good idea, but replacement was easy, maybe 10 minutes. Would not use if I was doing new construction."
2,Absolutely terrible,"I'm pretty sure this piece of junk is just a noise maker, not a fan at all. It's annoyingly loud at 30 feet away, around corners and through walls. By the ""toilet paper test"" it appears to not be moving air at all. It also seems to be sucking air in on one side and blowing it out on the other, which indicates it's not actually exhausting much air out at all.The install is very annoying; the actual fan unit is in 4-5 separate pieces which are not well held together; anybody who has the first idea about quiet fan construction would know right off the bat that this not going to work. If you have to do an unusual install at all, the pieces are very annoying to put back together.I highly recommend avoiding all Broan/NuTone vent fans. The Panasonic vent fans are vastly superior in every way."
3,really cool amanamatronic,This is a neat robotic toy because they could talk to other furbys. which is cool because most anamatronics can't do that.It is more advanced than the old furby. It sounds diffrent and looks difrent. It is cool.
3,Prima Guide,"Prima's guide for Pokemon Colosseum isn't nearly as good as the other guides. However it does give tips on the pokemon trainers you have to battle. What level they are at, type, and prize money. Which you don't get from Nintendo's guide. If just the tip on the pokemon trainers this guide is good, but for everything else Nintendo's walkthrough is alot better."
4,A Hint Book that spells it out or give you a nudge.,Well written book that will either take you through step by step or give you a nudge in the correct direction for if you are not sure what is the right way. Easy to read and very helpful.
3,X-files disappointment,"I liked the game to an extent, but felt it was very limited in the way you were able to go about finding the solutions, etc. It was a one way only, game. I also felt it was a little slow, especially, when your ideas didn't happen to coincide with the way the game was set up. It did have some good points and was enjoyable, in many ways, but for a 4 disc game I felt it lacked options and replay ability."
3,"Good game, but no replay value","This game is entertaining and will take a while to finish. However, there is absolutely no replay value. Mulder and Scully don't show up until late in the game, but that doesn't really detract from the fun. X-Files fans will like it but if you are not a fan of the TV show, don't buy it."
3,FMV does NOT a video game make....,"When will people learn that stuffing 4 CD's full of Full Motion Video (FMV) does *not* make a video game? X-Files:The Game is more like an interactive movie that a computer game. This genre died with Night Trap on the Sega CD. However, if you're an X-Files fan and enjoy a good 'whodunnit' this game is still a good buy (just try to find it on sale)."
4,games,Its fun to play if you have someone with you. If not I would get bored with it. Its awfully long but it was fun to play along with my daughter as my partner.
2,this game isn't that good,I bought this when I was a huge X-Files fan and I thought its ok but basically its hit a button see a cinamatic and I beat the game in like 2 days it isn't that good
2,It's kinda boring,"I love the x-files & I haven't missed an eppy for 3 years,but this game [is bad]. I'd be nicer, but I bought it for ... and my god, it's sooo slow. All, my other games r very fast, so i know it's the dumb x-files one that's messed up. Also, it's boring & barely anything exciting happens. Tho it is kinda funny when you kill urself or kill scully or mulder or your boss of whoever. Oh, I have the PC one... the box looks cool, but the game sucks. Rent it instead of buying it & you'll *so* see what I mean."
4,"Good game, good graphics, almost too simple.","Excellent game with excellent graphics. It is all filmed material, so it feels like you are actually out investigating with mulder & scully. Although, these excellent graphics didn't leave much room for developing a challenging game. I bought it on a Friday and by Sunday I was on disk four, which is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It would have been a bit better if you actually got to play as either Mulder or Scully too."
4,Fun,"I wasn't expecting much of this game after reading some reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised when I played it. You play the game as agent Willmore, and your assignment is to help find Mulder & Scully who dissapeared without a trace after checking into a hotel in Everett, WA. You must interact with different characters in the game and find clues from several different locations. With the artificial intelligence on the game isn't terribly difficult, but still challenging. Thank [goodness] for the save feature or else I would never finish, there are some tricky situations, without a walkthrough I might not have been able to figure out. There are cameos by central X-files figures including CSM, Skinner, the lone Gunmen, etc. I would play it again simply to focus on some of the details again, there is a lot to take in."
3,"Pretty pictures, outmoded science and thin content","Not much substance to the text. ""I went North, I watched the wolves take down some prey, I went back again, I didn't learn a whole heck of a lot about the wolves"". The big breakthrough was in just getting close to them at all.To be fair, at the time, it was a lot more contact than anyone else had been getting with wolves, but the book really just whets your appetite for the sequel, _10 years with the wolf pack_.Nice pictures."
5,Excellent book,"""Faith and the Pharisees,"" is an excellent book that shows point-by-point why the Word of Faith message is the best restoration of the truedoctrine and practice of the teachings of the Bible as given to the Apostles."
4,Cute!,"This book is ADORED by our one year old! Sheloves to open the flaps and see what is hiding. The story is cute, short and simple. So are the photos. Its' small enough for her to hold all by herself, too"
5,exelente libro de vegetales,este libro es exelente como profeccional y chef de un hotel en israel recomiendo este libro es exelente para profeccionales el libro tiene muchas ideas i sugerencias de este exelente chef las fotos son muy buenas lo recomiendo. este es un muy buen libro para chef esperimentados
4,Nice Shoes,"I got these shoes in the blue satin color, and they are a very rich blue color. Every time I wear these, I get a bountiful load of compliments. The satin is very soft, but the shoes are slightly narrow. I ended up buying these shoes in a half size larger than I normally wear. They are at first slightly tight, but as with all shoes they must be broken in. I really do like these shoes, but yet at the same time I wouldn't wear them for long periods of walking."
2,"Cute, but have a back-up pair to wear",I bought these shoes several months ago from a outlet retailer. I love the color and get lots of compliments. These shoes are not for long term wear. Thank goodness I usually have an extra pair of shoes in my car or office at work.
2,cute but uncomfortable,These are really cute but they are very narrow and it feels like you are walking barefoot.
1,NO WAY!!!!,"I Just got this shoes for my daughter and they look as if the feet were too uncomfortable. They don't seem to have a lot of space for the feet. Very little material and low quality. My daughter said that they feel weird. They will be going back as soon as possible!!! I will be more careful with similar flats from now on.... Only ONE STAR for the nice black shiny color. But them again, a pair of shoes is more(not less)than the color. I DO NOT recommend this product!!!"
1,Not A Review Just A Comment,"Thats the thing with movies though people get so worked up over it they post messages on message boards. It is entertainment no one will force you to watch. You can't sue someone over being tasteless. It may have crossed a line but thats the thing isn't it?? It got your attention and publicity and isn't that all they are looking for?? If no one responded they would still be where they are with nothing and working at WAL-MART, but I look at it as entertainment not a learning experience. An experience horrific as it may be is still an experience which we can learn from and when we have the chance to really say something then we can say it."
3,a columbine satire?,"This is a movie with a homemade quality. It is actually terrible- but watchable, if you are interested in the Columbine tragedy. The film makes fun of the many elements that could have led to these 2 boys doing what they did. The indifferent teachers and parents, the cruel peers, and more will make you laugh. So if you aren't able to handle a serious thing like Columbine being made a satire, don't watch it. If you can handle it being poked fun at, watch it and you might get a kick out if it."
4,a must buy,"This is an awesome game. I was rather dubious when buying the game, but it was much better than I had expected. The plot is original, and the graphics are good. The characters are well created, and I just think that it is an overall great game!!"
1,lies lies lies,"This book was not in the condition listed. In fact, it's practically falling apart. I also found it quite tacky they left a $0.50 sticker on it. I got ripped off but that won't happen again. I will never buy from this seller again!"
2,Poorly edited mess -- avoid it,"I checked this one out from the library and managed to read it, but just barely. It is almost a textbook example of poor editing (both in terms of copy-editing - making sure all the needed words were present and that the punctuation was correct, and in terms of content-editing - making sure that the authors had something coherent and interesting and on-topic to say). If you want to know about the Knights Templar, read almost any other book in print -- this one is a waste of your time."
2,Ralls vrs Olsen,"I didn't get a feeling that the authors answered the questions set out on the jacket to any great satisfaction. I definitely prefer reading Karen Ralls, as a scholarly author, rather than the popular history authors presented here."
4,Some thoughts on The Templar Papers,"For the most part I thoroughly enjoyed the Templar Papers. Very informative, especially with some things I had not heard or read before. Being from many different authors, including the one who compiled the articles for the book, it had many different views and flavors. Only one of the authors irritated me with his wild speculations that, to my view and my understanding through other research, are quite unfounded, and I think he was trying to create some controversy. The only other thing that could have been better is the proofreading. Overall, the book made me want to take a trip to the UK to check out some of these things in person!"
2,This Book is Balderdash!,"The fact that this author would even allude to the fact that Jesus and Mary were lover shows the lengths a person will go to get someone to buy the book. Because of this, readers should be aware that a lot of suppositions will be made by the author to tantalize but not educate. How can one trust what he/she is reading in this book? Only lovers of pure fiction will enjoy it because truth is lacking here."
2,More of the Same,"This is a compilation of both sides of the story. More of the same. Since buying this book the Catholic church has found some 700 year old documents regarding Templar history. In due time, I'm sure there will be a book explaining the findings. I'd recommend waiting for that release."
1,Disappointing ring,"While I did not think I was getting an expensive ring at $15 I was hoping for something that did not feel as if I could have gotten it in a vending machine. The edges are sharp, the darkened parts look like they were etched with a dull pencil. Trust me, spend more someplace else and get a better ring."
3,Memories,"Brought back good memories, but its still a playstation 1 game so it's as good as it can ever be."
3,This game wasn't anything like the movie.,"Even know I am a HUGE fan of Small Soldiers, I knew a video game soon enought. The video game was so diffrent from the movie it's not funny. oh well."
1,Huge Dissapiontment,"This game looks like a fun movie based game. I beg you please do not make the same mistake i did and purchase this game. The graphics are horrid (not to mention the awful veiws)and The sound is the worst. It may look cool from the cover, but looks can be decieving.Please DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
2,Fascinating footnotes aren't enough to redeem bad text,"Boy, there's a lot in this book, but not a lot about credit cards or even consumer credit. I learned that Dail-a-Porn lasts 57 seconds, how truckers negotiate prices from prostitutes on CB radio, and that a certain woman who doesn't find Arabian-nights themed hotel rooms sexy prefers bondage games. But what is the point: that credit lets people buy things, that credit cards let people borrow to buy, that a card rather then currency removes a fetish for retaining money, or that a card encourages annonymity? Don't truckers pay hookers in cash anyway?This is a messy pastiche of the author's previous academic paper, the type of sociology that consists of recounting the scripts of ads then telling readers what the advertisers were really trying to say, and lots of academic sounding references. Freud, Marx, Weber, Veblen,Maury Povich,and Foucalt have all been included in that festive intellectual name- dropping style."
5,giving my laptop a longer life...,"I have a 2004 Compaq Presario. It still works great as a kids computer but cant use the original charger. The pin where the charger inserts into the computer keeps breaking. Have had it repaired but its over $100 and only works for a few months before it breaks again. I ran across this external battery charger and figured it was worth a try. It has made all the difference! I can continue to use the computer for as long as it keeps charging. (and it was significantly less $ than taking my computer back to the repair shop) Sometimes it is a hassle to take out the battery to charge it, but would much rather do that than trash the laptop. It was a good price, shipped quickly and has worked perfectly. Am very glad I purchased this charger!"
4,A First Step Into the World of Science,This is the most colourful book I own. A wide variety of photos are presented in different topics to make readers grasp the 'everyday' feeling. Every topic covers an idea with a well-written short text which is understandable to first-timers. This is a book I would recommend to junior science students and general readers who want to begin their exploration in science.
2,Didn't quite make it for me,"The cover's nice enough to catch my eye. The review blurbs comparing this book to a cross between Narnia and Valdemar was enough to convince me to pick it up.Unfortunately, this book lacks the charm of Narnia, and the action of Valdemar. The characters don't develop well at all, the plot was shaky overall and downright unbelievable in places. Of the two big revelations toward the end of the book, one I'd called during the first couple of chapters, the other was improbable enough to be unbelievable.Sorry, but I won't be picking up the rest of the trilogy."
2,I've read better fanfiction...,"I couldn't believe this got published, and then I read who the author's friends were...Has a HUGE show don't tell problem, flat, unengaging characters, and a boring, predictable plot which is not make fresh or original in any way. It read like an outline of a story. I kept reading in hopes it got better, but had to put it done in despair about half way through.I gave it two stars because it was a fairly creative idea (that I wish this author could have done more with) and it was readable (in terms of grammar and spelling)."
3,sorry i disagree.....,"unlike the previous reviewers, i did not really like book overly much, but it was a read. i found the evil, talking birds a bit corny, and not really all that evil, just dumb. And if you hate books that focus around young children (teenage), this was one of those.The one good thing about the book, the ending. the last 50 or so pages were quite good, and may have been enough to make me read the next book.But give this book a go any way, YOU may like it."
5,It works,These pillow covers really work great. They have helped myself and my spouse. They are comfortable and feel great too. What a deal!
5,Sleep Well!,"I love these pillows! After reading some reviews, I decided on the Cotton pillow cases which are a bit cheaper than other versions. Man, am I glad that I opted for this brand. They are so comfortable and I noticed an immediate difference in my breathing at night. I am asthmatic and have severe allergies and I've been waking up without a stuffy nose thanks to these pillows. Now I'm going to buy more cases and a mattress cover too."
4,"Pretty soft and comfortable, hard to tell if it's working","I bought this because I have asthma and want to block out dust mites, which I've read can aggravate asthma. It's hard to tell how well it works for that, but at least it's pretty comfortable. It's not quite as nice as my old pillow case, but it's pretty close. It's certainly not plasticy like I've read some of these kinds of pillow cases are."
5,Great product for reducing allergies,"Great, great product! I purchased a complete set (pillow, pillow protector and mattress protector) and have found that my step daughter's allergies and asthma symptoms have significantly improved. The pillow is soft and comfortable -- and does not make her cough and sneeze during the night or in the morning when she wakes up. What a relief for her and me!"
4,Aller Ease Cotton Allergen Barrier Standard Pillow Cover,I like the pillow covers very much...they are perfect for your old pillows too...especially if you just rather not get rid of them.
5,Best product for my allergies,"I wish I would have known about this product sooner! After just one night, I have noticed a major improvement in my allergy symptoms. I sleep better and haven't been waking up during the night with that horrible cough. I am going to buy this pillow for every bed in my house."
2,Too bulky,"I ordered this to replace another Geoffrey Beene wallet that I've worn out over the last few years. Unfortunately, the design has changed: instead of a simple tri-fold design with ID window on one of the panel flaps, there are fewer card slots on the main panels and an extra 4th panel insert has been sewn in to the center of the wallet.The center flap adds a lot of bulk -- I fit everything I needed into the previous wallet, and had no problem keeping it in my back pocket. But this one sits almost 1/2"" thicker when folded shut, and isn't too comfy to sit on."
1,The wallet that missed Christmas,"I ordered the Geoffrey Beene Trifold wallet, well within the time when delivery before Christmas was assured. The order was confirmed, along with an estimated date of delivery several days before Christmas. Just before Christmas, but too late to order anything online for that day, I received a notice saying delivery would be in late January. I cancelled the order, went shopping at a nearby Macy's store and bought a wallet at least as nice and at a much better sale price. Well, I cannot really review the walled I had ordered because I never received it, but Amazon's communications about the purchase and the failure to deliver a promised good gets a zero."
4,The wedding of the year flop was a sad way to end an otherwise enjoyable season.,"I truly enjoyed this show right up until the last ""add on"" show featuring the wedding - what a disappointing way to end the season for a show I've followed since day one. Part of it was the never ending promos leading up to that show on Facebook. I should have taken it as a sign when all the hoopla suddenly disappeared without a single word about the show. The long anticipated wedding episode appeared thrown together and just entirely too mushy-for-mushy-sake. Still a fan of the show, I'm just hoping this isn't a sign of what's to come in Season 5."
1,Damn niece! LOL,"Allowed my 4 year old niece to play with my Kindle and she somehow order this video. she always asked to play with the KINDLE when she comes over. I usually put her on some kids website but some how she end up changing sites and ordered this on my AMAZON account. Wasn't happy about it, but my fault. She is not to use the KINDLE anymore after this. LOL."
2,Downhill Slide,"I am sad to see Royal Pains make such a downhill slide this season. It used to be a series that had some great emergency medical stories and how Hank could improvise his way to solving a challenge, and saving a life with plastic tubing and a pen knife! This season is more of a nighttime soap about relationships, the business of Hank Med, and some hyped up drama about nothing with Boris and his Russian friend. I mean did he really need to take the SIM card out of his phone before heading to the mansion? Who is writing this stuff this season? Sorry that I got the season pass!"
1,show went straight downhill,Boy did this show go downhill. The first season was great and I had high hopes for this show but that didn't last
2,Good picture but the sound was out of sync,This downloaded quickly and the picture quality was great. The sound was not good there was a two second delay between the sound and the video.
5,I have been eating this my whole life,"I started eating these as a kid and I still love them. I am not Asain, but I like foods from all over the world. These candies have a little rice paper edible wrapper. While the toys moved to stickers now the candy is still really good. It has a unique flavor and I just cannot get enough of these. They are pretty wholesome for candy. They really are a special treat. I think they are healthier than other candies. I am not sure what American kids of today would think, but if they are not used to total junk I think they would like them. These are really special. The taste is really light. They are chewy and sticky so you would not want to give them to really little kids for risk of choaking. I do think they would be healthier than other things and might be nice for a holiday special gift or other special occasion for an older child. Someone who is age 5 and up would be perfect."
2,Botan rice candy.,Only got orange- said multiple flavors. Wanted to order more quantity at at time for a little lower price. Was the same good candy I remember though.
4,An Entertaining and Memorable Read,"The Crystal Cavern by author Hannah Alexander is a memorable, page-turning story. Join Sable Chamberlin and Paul Murphy on a quest to unravel the secrets of the caves beneath Sable's home. What mystery did her grandfather stumble upon before his untimely death? Will they be able to find out in time, or will they die trying? In Agatha Christie tradition, the story finds Sable and Paul trapped in a house with a suspicious group of strangers, many with their own set of secrets. Someone is sabotaging Sable and Paul's efforts to get to the bottom of the mystery, bringing them to the brink of disaster. Will they escape this villain's clutches, before it is too late?I found The Crystal Cavern to be an enjoyable read, with characters that stayed with me long after the story ended. Hannah Alexander knows how to weave an intriguing tale. You won't be disappointed."
3,"Ok, but I've read better","Didn't find this book as compelling as I'd hoped. A new author for me,so I'll try another one of their books. This book just didn't keep my attention as I'd hoped. It had a good plot, but just didn't deliver as I'd hoped."
2,Time Warp Therapy,"This book seems like it was written at the beginning stages of the self-help pop psychology movement. It is like an extra long version of a fashion magazine article on anger ""styles."" Get yourself a practical book that gets to the heart of the matter like 60 second anger management : quick tips to handle explosive feelings by Michael Hershorn. Anger Management Workbook by W.A.Angus is also a good choice for its practicality. The Anger Workbook by Lorraine Bilodeau is a very straightforward book that illuminates the many causes of anger that aren't just behavioral."
3,"Very detailed, very tiny print...",This book has everything in it. It has so much it is hard to find what you want. However a good resource. My main beef is it would be nice if the print were larger.
5,How to Organize (Just About) Everything,"Highly Recommend. Love the incites, checklists, etc. Something in this book for everyone, no matter what stage of life your in."
2,Big Disappointment,"I had high hopes for this book based on the 5 star reviews, and they were not even close to being met. Many of the lists were overly simplistic without any helpful organizing tips at all. Even more annoying was that virtually every list crossed referenced at least one other list, so one had to keep flipping around to get some sort of cohesive idea of what the organizational tips were. Perhaps if less time had been spent on titles like ""how to win an academy award"" , ""how to fend off pirates"" and/or ""what to do in an ebola break out"" (I am not kidding, these are actual lists)and more on actual real life organizing, I would have gotten much more out of this book."
5,How to Organize Just About Everything by Peter Walsh,"This acquisition is perfect if your purpose is to organize a household methodically. The author provides details on how toweed junk mail, establish tickler files and calendar importantdeadlines. The book assists in balancing home life with work,budgeting and ""to do lists"". The volume even covers the detailsof maintaining a healthy lifestyle, as well as junk food avoidance.The author provides websites for selling off unnecessary personalitems. i.e.- Craigslist.org- Bidadoo.com- Monster.com job search- Half.com- Makeovermatic@substance.comPurchase this book if your purpose is to bring permanentorganization into your house for the foreseeable future."
2,A Waste of money,"I didn't want information about organizing a block party or winning the Tour de France, just my clutter filled closets! I thought this book was about organizational skills to help you learn how to conquer your clutter. Learning how to direct a film or become a model just wasn't the type of information I wanted."
1,How to Organize Just About Everything,You can find the information in this book anywhere on the internet. Very disappointing. I would have returned the book but return time had expired and I would only get partial refund and have to pay shipping. I'll give it to the Salvation Army for their store. Don't waste your money. Disappointed in Amazon also.
4,Very Handy book to have around,"When it says (just about)everything, it really mean it. It gives me a general rule on how to organize. I am a terrible organizer and get very confused with all those stuff i have accumulated over the years.I hope this will give me a lift-up, as I really don't know what to get rid of and what to keep. Everything seems useful to me."
4,Great how guide for just about everything,"My goal was to get organized and this book helped!It has over 500 suggestions on how to organize everything, from the pile of papers in the office to the laundry room to the family schedule.It's full of little organizing tips that I would have never thought of.This book is great for the person who wants to be organized but just doesn't know where to start!"
2,Too little information,"This book does have ideas on how to organize almost anything, 501 to be exact. Many of the topics are not useful such as: ""Win the Tour de France"", ""Win an Academy Award"", ""Become President of the U.S."", and the list goes on...The topics I found somewhat useful like ""Design a new landscape"", ""Plan a Remodel"" had commonsense ideas and were not detailed enough to give me any new ideas."
1,Don't Waste your Money or Time!,"I was so disappointed in this book!! I read almost every chapter unless it was something that would obviously be a waste of time like ""How to Become a Model or Movie Director"", what does that have to do with getting organized? 98% of this book is just plain stupid. The only good tip I got was to use a cross stitch fabric to hold earrings, ha! This book is huge, but has very little real advice on getting your home organized. I'm glad I borrowed it from my library before purchasing it!"
5,Absolutely Terrific!,"I (used to) have seventeen boxes of self-help books in my garage. They were neatly boxed and labeled, but they were there. Now that I own ""How To Organize (Just About) Everything"" they're gone. I don't need them.All the soul-searching I did in the 1960s, and the newer digging deep inside myself for answers I fell for during the 1980s have been compressed into one-page solutions to life's challenges in this terrific book.I don't have to analyze why I want a piece of chocolate; I just have to eat it right. My husband doesn't have to mourn not becoming an astronaut; he can simply read what to do if he decides to become world's oldest man in space.Many of the people who don't like this book seem to want something ""more."" Well, I've been to More and back again, and this book suits me just fine. If you're not looking for deep psychological or philosophical answers, this book is wonderful!"
3,Too detailed,"There were so many things to organize in this book, that not much detail was paid to any one item, leaving me full of questions. Not exactly what I was looking for."
4,Soothingly soulful,"If you have ever caught yourself singing the ""Life Savers...Yummm"" candy jingle, then you will like this CD. The harmony of their voices will sooth your soul. I only wish that the CD had a more diverse sampling of their work."
4,The Best of Ladysmith Black Mambazo,This CD brings an uplifting spirit to the listener. My husband enjoys the crisp sound of voices in unison and harmony. We found this music quite enjoyable. You can feel the spirituality of the musicians as they bring you each note.
3,Interesting but...........,This is very interesting music.Sound quality is very good.What i didn't like is that most of the tracks are very simillar - if you would skip between tracks you wouldn't notice that the track was changed.
3,Felt like a bunch of bees humming in my head.,"We love the Paul Simon Graceland cd...and we love Ladysmith Black Mambazo on that album too. However, an entire album of their harmonizing chants gets really painful to listen to. That is, if you aren't a fan or into that musical genre to begin with. That is me. So, I shut the CD off, haven't listened to it since. My head feels better!They are such talented, gifted musicians. Just make sure that you are up for an entire cd of their musical style."
5,Music for Music Lovers,"This CD rocks. Even the Non-Irish will enjoy this great new band. A mixture of traditional Irish song and Rock. If you like this album, find them live in the Philadelphia Area. They're just as good in person."
1,This stuff in nonsence!,This pillow case has no use while you can't use it during sleeping and you can't wash it.Don't buy this! It's nonsense plastic pillow case!Whoever wants to sleep with a plastic pillow case?And the company never offer you a solution if you buy it!
5,Fully compatible with OEM,"Easy to install and fixed my problem. Quick delivery and good packing. I had budgeted 2 hours to do this job, and it took about 20 minutes."
3,Great game but could've been better,"Before the start of this review, I just want to say that I am a fan of the X-Men since The Dark Phoenix saga. That aside, this game has the makings of a good start in truly representing the comic book medium. In this incarnation of the comic book series, you must fight all of the heroes in order to advance to the villains and ultimately, Magneto. While the 3-D renderings look great on the characters as a whole, the implementation onto a 2-dimensional environment loses the overall effect. While that may be a minor blow, the bigger problem is that it uses basically the same game engine as Street Fighter Alpha, which is very outdated. The makers should've went all the way and created a rich 3-D environment for the characters to interact with, similar to the far superior Spider-Man (just released). If you really like the X-Men, buy this game and overlook its shortcomings. But for the casual fighter fan, wait for PS2's Tekken Tag Team."
4,Finally a Good X-men Game for the playstation,"In X-Men Mutant Academy there are so many different ways to play:Survival Mode, Arcade Mode, Academy Mode, and Two Players. There are also hundreds of FMV's and screenshots to unlock. The graphics are pretty good. The sound however is X-MenMA's weakest point. Although the music is good you can hardly hear it while your playing. The difficulty is hard, even on easy it's surprisingly challenging. If you want to unlock all the FMV's and screenshots from the comicbook and the movie it will take you a few months if not longer. If you want a challenging fighter with tons of extras check it out."
5,X-men's Facelift,"Finally, the X-men have moved beyond the old 2D Marvel look and have entered the new millenium with amazizing graphics! The eye-boggling effects just add on to the all ready great game and made it even better."
2,Hair Spray,"I have fine hair. The hair spray works well on fine hair because the spray did not blow the hair when applying. However, the dispenser cloggs easily. The hair spray is called firm hold, but I would say that it does not give you a firm hold. I was disappointed."
5,Excellent book for teaching Music theory. Children & adult,I can recommend this to music educators public and private and even Homeschoolers. The lessons are straightforward and thorough. Highly recommend! I'm starting my almost 5 year old on it and he is picking it all up nicely.
5,Master Theory,"WOW! VERY VERY VERY effective! I'm a Sophomore in High School, and I learned all of what I know in music theory in 6th grade, due to this series. Very awesome set of books, and is easy enough for a child to understand. I would recommend this to ALL music teachers, (chorus, band, piano, orchestra). It will help your students!! There are 6 books in the set."
5,Completely satisfied!,"Purchasing Timeshock from you on Amazon was my first experience with Amazon and I was completely satisfied. The game is in excellent condition, price was unbeatable and I received it much sooner than I expected. Thank you!"
4,"Some good, some bad","Where HTML for Dummies went wrong, the quick refference picks up the slack. I've read HTML for Dummies and found it an almost useless tool. It taught me nothing more than I had already known which was not a great deal. This book however plainly lays out how to do some of the most usefull coding. The great thing is that it requires very little knowledge of HTML to be doing immage maps and forms in no time. This is definately a must for those who want to design a personal or professional webpage."
3,Half-and-half,"Half of what is taught in this book is obsolete; however, if you are starting from the begining - the other half is the begining at a pace that can be appreciated in the fact that not everyone teaching or who knows this langauge teaches you everything that they know. Do they teach this in college?"
3,Short and Sweet,"This is a recording of a talk given by Dyer and Chopra at (I think) the Chopra institute. They are both speaking ""off-the-cuff"" and provide a description of what is required to manifest something into your life. There are 4 ""reallys"" required to manifest anything: wish, desire, will/intention, and passion.I was somewhat disappointed that they didn't go into detail on ""how"" to manifest something, but just outlined what was required. They both agree that meditation is an excellent way to achieve a powerful state for manifesting, but leave this as an exercise for the listener. A good companion to this tape-set is the Dyer CD called ""Meditations for Manifesting"" which contains a guided meditation to manifest anything into your life.On the whole, I think the other materials put out by Chopra and Dyer individually are much better. Only buy this tape-set if you've read their other works first."
2,disappointment,"I have read several books by both Chopra and Dyer. This tape was humorous and somewhat interesting but "" nothing new under the sun"". Seemed a bit disjointed.I could have spent the money on something with more depth from them. I felt as if this was just a quick tape made to sell because of their names."
5,Great Motivational Tool,"Over the years, I've been a fan of Wayne Dyer, listening to him on audio mostly. Normally, I'm the one who grows through these types of self-help books, but so has he. I view him as a man who walks the walk, not just pays lip service.Deepak Chopra is someone I admire, but I haven't read as much of his books, not like I have with Dyer. This have been the first time I've experienced the combination of the both.Dyer's wit and willingness to discuss his human side is a motivator. Chopra is a deeper thinker and less funny. The two are a bit like sweet and sour sauce for the soul. Both combined makes a winning combination.The two disc CD is in front of a live audience where they discuss how to achieve your goals with four simple steps. This is a great motivational tool in my book."
3,Average collection of Star Wars fiction,"This was not the worst collection but certainly not the best of the tales of/from short short series. There were a few interesting stories but overal not a great read. Mara Jades story was just out of place. I love Zahn's writing but he can't write a story without including Mara Jade or Thrawn and it was aparantly easier to place Mara there instead of the blue skinned Thrawn. I did enjoy the last story by A.C. Crispin about the plus size dancer. This is a collection that would not be interesting to the casual fan, but serious fans would find these stories at least interesting."
4,"A ""where are they now"" type book. Not bad.","I was really surprised how well written this book was by the different authors. Many characters you only saw in passing really come to life thanks to the creative minds of the sci-fi writers. For some reason the characters seems more alive than the other ""Tales..."" books from the SW universe. It's worth the reading time."
3,Star Wars,"This is a collection of short stories. It is interesting and helps fill in some gaps. However, do not expect main movie characters to be a big part of the book."
4,A compelling backstory for Jabba's goons,"As with any edited volume of short stories, it's difficult to rateTales from Jabba's Palace (Star Wars) (Book 2). I think sometimes there are some truly fascinating backstories for Jabba's goons, but too often it seems the authors don't even try to encourage readers to suspend disbelief. Some of the plot twists are simply comical - and not in a good way. I was particularly disappointed with the story of Gartogg the Gamorrean, which simply exaggerates the stereotype of Gamorreans as dumb pigs. Also, I was disappointed that none of the stories provide a backstory for Jabba himself. This volume is still worth reading for fans ofStar Wars Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, but doesn't live up to the standards ofTales from Mos Eisley Cantina."
5,Awesome!,Awesome book! I HIGHLY suggest that you read it! So much backstory added to the characters seen in the STAR WARS movie(s)! The 'minor' characters seem to be far more interesting than the 'main' players. There is not one story here that isn't great!A+ for everything!
4,My Favorite of the SW Tales Books,"I like this book - a lot. It's a quick read and I tore through it, interested in every story, which is something I can't say for the other Tales books. The stories of the various characters really interconnect, more so than in other SW anthologies, and that lent a nice continuity to the book. There was even a recurring mystery that popped up in several stories.I thought the writing was excellent through out and some great authors pop up in the pages. I'm a particular fan of Jennifer Roberson. The only story I was somewhat disappointed in was Timothy Zahn's tale of Mara Jade - and that is mostly because I wish they would have made it longer with more depth.But otherwise, this book does a great job of fleshing out the stories of the various beings in Jabba's place during the beginning of RotJ - I recommend it to any Star Wars fan."
3,A collection of short stories,Some interesting background stories on different characters from Jabba's Palace. Gives a little background on what happened to Jabba's Palace after Return of the Jedi. It connects with many other Star Wars books. I recommend it.
3,okay if taken in one gulp,"For the most part, these collected stories are fairly dry, trying to cram as many semi-interesting facts as possible about some generally obscure characters into tales that cover a very brief and therefore restricting period in the Star Wars history. However, if read consecutively, some common threads appear concerning ongoing political machinations and interrelated subplots. Richer than ""Mos Eisley,"" not as much depth as ""Bounty Hunters."""
3,Interesting then tiresome,"When I first started this book it seemed very interesting to me.You find out what happens to all those background aliens in Jabba's palace,however there are more boring stories than interesting ones.Also the same occurances happen in each tale so you read the same thing from someone else's point of view and it can drive you mad.Salacius crumb's tale is my favorite.The Rancor keeper's tale is also good.I only wish the tales occured at different times instead of all at the same time.It would of made the book way more interesting.Worth reading if you are a die hard star wars fan like myslf but that is as far as it goes"
4,What ever happened to...,"This book is deffinetly one to buy for the typical Star Wars maniac. It tells what happens to people like Boba Fett, Bib Fortuna and others that may be unfamiliar to you. I give it an 8 because I was dicapointed that they never focused in on Jabba's history. All in all it is a good book that ties together nicely"
4,"One plot, more than 15 stories","Great narration, the writing is very consistent and each and every tale is tightly fit within the others, that may be a problem though, because every story has the same plot in it and you end up reading some passages over and over in every story, anyway the round of applause here goes to Kevin Anderson for the hard work it must've been to make every tale fit within the context of the other, every author polished their work to the extreme, and while some tales are more interesting than others, you'll enjoy all of them."
3,Not bad,"It's hard to review this book. I didn't hate it or really like it, it's in between. I liked some stories and I didn't like some. What I really liked was how it all tied in with every story. It must have taken a while to do that. If you like the characters in Jabba's Palace or like Star Wars it's a good read."
4,SOME STORIES GOOD SOME BAD,Some stories were the bomb some were horrible. I'd say it had more good stories than bad so READ IT!
4,"Jabba's Palace, More Than For Just A Star Wars Geek","Ok, ok, ok. I might not be the biggest Star Wars fan out there. For example, I have done little more than watch the movies. That is why I thought I would give this book a try because it seemed like a reasonable foray into a galaxy far, far away. I think I picked this one because the cover look cool. So to say that I am not a star war fanatic is not an understatement. What I found in this book is a collection of good stories. Some were a little boring and childish, but the bulk of the collection was worth while. Those stories did a great job of creating a very good visual image of the world that was comprised by Jabba's Palace. Get this and enjoy a trip to another world."
5,Great Book- But Where Is Jabba's Tale?,"Everyone Has A Tale- except Jabba. The only disapointment other than that is Boba's tale. I like Bubo's tale, especially siince I didn't even know he was intelligent. The Weequays who worshipped the magic 8 Ball was a trip, though it remained unclear what caused the sail barge to blow."
4,"Some stories great, some stories bad","Some of the stories were okay, some were pretty bad. I didn't like: Slacious Crumb, Bubo, and The Asassians Tale. Why didn't they have one about Jabba?"
3,"This book was okay, I guess.","This book was interesting because it showed different points of view from 19 different characters, from the time Luke Skywalker came to Jabba's Palace, to the time Jabba's pet rancor died. But some of the stories were very detailed and hard to get into."
1,Very Poorly Made - Doors fall off,Do not bother buying this product. On christmas morning my son opened this and 2 of the doors fell off. I reattached them as per the user manual but now they won't open so it is useless. I wish I had read the reviews before I bothered to buy this.
2,"The roundhouse doors are not ""3-year-old-proof""","Not only did the doors get knocked off in the first two hours of play, one of the door mechanisms broke as a result, so that the door couldn't be replaced. While my 3-year-old seems to glean as much enjoyment out of it without the doors (I simply leave them off, now), I'm disappointed with the poor durability of a ~$100 toy."
3,Deluxe Version Not Worth The Extra $$,"I bought the deluxe version because it supposedly had the ability to make a lot of engine noises and can recognize the talking railway series trains. There are probably 3 different sounds at the most and the regular wooden trains can activate them (you don't need the talking engine series trains). Plus, like everyone else complained about, the far right door sticks and have popped off already. On the positive side, this roundhouse has exquisite details. However, the cheaper roundhouse would have served it's purpose just as well and I could have saved myself the extra money."
2,Can't believe Take 2 Interactive made it,"I brought this game back in February 14th 2012. I thought this game will be good. A fighting game developed by Take 2 Interactive. But when I pop it in, the introduciton is great. 25 mins later. The game absolutely sucks! The graphics are very blocky, the controls are handicapped, and the gameplay is slow and broken. I notcied something that this is yet another horrible game published by Acclaim. After reading this review, don't not play this game! There are better 3D fighting games on PS1 than Iron & Blood.Pros:Awesome MusicCool storylineCool cutscenesCons:Very Blocky and Dull graphicsHandicapped ControlsNo special movesFalse advertisingSlow & Broken Gameplay"
1,God awful,"If you come across this game, run away as fast as you can. The graphiics are nice, but everything else about this title sucks. The fighting is slow and choppy, the characters are lame and this game could possibly be one of the worst of all time."
1,Voted one of the worst games period,Where to start with this game?Bad graphics? Bad controls? Poor speed...even on the characters who were supposed to be the fast fighters in the game.I bought this game when it first came out 1 because I am a D&D; geek the other is because I like fighting games they game fell miserble on both levels. Then I believe it was either EGM or Game Pro that voted this one of the worst games in history and trust me folks it earned that title.STAY AWAY from this GAME before it corrupts you...to late for me.
2,Sufficiant but awkward.,"Before I say anything about this item I should put forward that I am using them for protection on a unicycle, which could have slightly different needs then a skater.While they sufficiantly protect my wrists, these are some of the more awkward wrist pads I own. I am not able to make a fist or grab onto the seat of my Uni in these, though I can in other types of wrist gaurds.The three straps is nice for custom fitting but involves a lot of adjustment and are sometimes more work then they are worth.For the price, they are good stable wrist pads, but if the price isn't an issue, I would suggest going with a different design."
1,Tiny! waste of money,"Okay so i bought these and it says ages 13 to adult, yeah right. They don't fit me. I am only 145pounds and for my hight,good. Therefore my arm/wrist is not big. the straps are too small in length and not closing, if only the straps were a bit longer then they'll be great. Complete waste of money."
2,"OK Wrist Guards, Cheap price and Inferior Materials","I needed to replace a 15 year old pair of RollerBlade wrist guards of the same style. These are not nearly the quality of my old wrist guards. They will do the job of protecting ones wrists and palms, but the materials just don't have a nice feel. Material is stiff, seams are sharp. Also the sizing runs small. I ordered an adult large and velcro straps nearest the elbow barely makes it around my forearm."
5,Baby Catcher - Beautiful Book,"Baby Catcher is probably the most wonderful book I have ever read.Peggy Vincent tells her memoirs of delivering babies in a delightful, honest and real-life way that makes very exciting reading.I couldn't put the book down and would highly recommend this book for mothers-to-be and midwives-to-be."
5,Deeply sentimental account of childbirth,"I loved this book! I felt deeply gripped by Peggy's descriptions of her entry into the profession of midwifery in the '50's to her eventual forced retirement. She began nursing in a time when the majority of births were completely medicated. You will be mortified to read of Zelda, in Chapter 1, as the doctor forces drugs upon her. Later you will meet Naema, a pregnant, but married, teen-ager. You will watch her and her husband progress as parents and become respected community members. This book was one of the most uplifting reads that I have had in recent days. My own birth was in a hospital with a doula. After reading this, I am even more convinced that next time I want a midwife. Amazing!"
3,Good not Great,"I stumbled across this book on my kindle and I figured I would give it a shot for the price. Was good but not great, finished it but not one of those books that you just can't put down."
3,I'm glad this book is out there,"Bit corny, especially the first chapter but I've been waiting for a personal book written by a midwife. Easy to read and entertaining."
5,Wonderful true stories,This book tells the honest truth of the wonders and joys of being a midwife as well as the ups and downs. The love for women and for birth. I could not put the book down.
5,"Vincent shares her experience with depth, wit, & excitement","This book is sooo interesting. Peggy Vincent started as a nurse in the sixties, and became a childbirth educator, a mother, and a midwife in a very exciting time. She recounts many births she attended, each with its own timeline, beauty, and of course some humorous circumstances. She recalls how doctors, hospital beaurocracy, lay midwifery, and womens' trust in their own bodies all create a revolution in childbirth. Peggy Vincent had the unique perspective as a pioneer nurse-midwife who not only witnessed policies being shaped, but led the charge in the Berkeley area. A great read for those interested in the history and revolution of childbirth ... or anyone, for that matter. My husband got hooked a few times during some of the more intense birth scenes. Enjoy!"
1,Didn't live up to the hype...,"Even though the reviews for this book weren't great, I decided to give it a go. At first the author seemed genuine, but as I read on I felt the author was more into self glorification than their craft of being a midwife.I wish I would have borrowed this book from the library instead of having purchased it in hardback."
5,Memory Lane,"Absolutely one of the best books I read of late. I was a labor and delivery nurse in the mid 70's when so many changes occurred. This book took me down memory lane of all of the wonderful experiences I had as I labored women before the ""electronic age"". Thank you Peggy and your women for sharing the most intimate part of their lives."
5,To know her is to love her,"Peggy caught my third baby and wrote about it anonymously and with permission in Babycatcher. She had the spirit and courage to allow me to give birth any way I wanted. What a relief and help she was. When I told her that I really wanted to be a midwife she said, ""Oh no you don't. In California you have to go to nursing school for three or four years and then enter a midwifery training program for another year. It costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time and when you're finished with all of that, you have to unlearn everything they taught you in order to become a good midwife."" She was right. So I went to Maternidad la Luz in El Paso, TX where they train midwives in a more holistic way. Then I made a video, Birth Day (which is also for sale on Amazon.com)to share my feeling that women can give birth joyfully, even ecstatically and without the harmful effects that drugs can have on little babies."
5,Riveting!,"I read this book in two sittings and absolutely could not put it down. Peggy was thorough and entertaining and ... wow. You ought to read this book if you have any interest in the birth process at all. If you've not yet had a baby or might have another in the future or will ever talk to a woman about birthing options or if you are mad at your sister because she chose to home birth or ... whatever ... read this. If you are thinking about being a midwife ... read this. It might scare you out of it or inspire you into it, but either way ... awesome."
5,This Book is Awesome!,"I'm pregnant and looking to having my baby at home. I've read all the books and watched all the DVDs about home birth, but this book really made it personal and beautiful. Upon reading story after entertaining story of home births, you begin to realize that not every home birth is alike. And why should they be? Loved this book! I would think that anyone pregnant or any mothers would enjoy this book."
5,I read it three times and would eagerly devour it again.,"A fun and wonderful work. I gobbled it up in a day and half the first time around; laughed, cried, and read parts outloud to my boyfriend. As a student midwife, I can tell you this book will always have a spot in my personal library. I didn't agree at all with the reviewer who suggested that Peggy tried to compile nothing but births with a seat-of-your-pants feel - I believe these were her favorites. And I couldn't recall anything in this novel that struck me as ""vulgar."""
4,Thoroughly Enjoyed,"Got this book as part of my quest to research the field of midwifery. Peggy Vincent has great style as an author whose retelling of her experiences bring you through a range of emotions , and give you a little insight into what life as a midwife could be like.I like that she didn't hold back from writing about negative experiences or situations that didn't paint her in the best light.You saw her grow through the book. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,It gave me some context,"The great thing about the stories in Baby Catcher is that they gave me some context for understanding labor and delivery. Before reading this book I only vaguely understood what they were. Peggy Vincent gives the reader a midwife's view of more than a dozen labors and deliveries. Although each birth is unique, some very helpful patterns emerged. I am grateful for having this vicarious experience and I will use it to decide whether to attempt a drug-free delivery."
5,Hilarious!,This book is hilarious and touching and at times even a little sad. Her stories are shocking and amazing. Well written. You won't be able to put this book down!
2,Accentuated LInes,"Another disappointment. I don't have a lot of lines, but for the few I do have, I thought this stuff would make me look perfect. NOT! It actually accentuated my fine lines. It is also really heavy and you can't see your skin through it. I'm too lazy to send it back, so I'll put it in my collection of foundations."
5,Avant-Guide London,"This guide is perfect for the traveler that wants to get beyond the tourist traps and mundane of London. Geared toward the younger traveler it gives great listings of shopping, lodging and dining(with price estimate). Also included are reviews of several nightclubs which most travel books overlook. A must-have!"
2,The best worm book written - I've read most,This book is by far the best all around worm guide I have ever read. It contains the most comprehensive information available to start raising worms for home use or profit.
5,Fascinating Read,"William Mann is one of the world's leading researchers and thinkers on the subject of the Knights Templar. In this work he makes a strong case for a fascinating possibility--that the Templars came to North America to map the New World. In researching my own novel on the subject,Cabal of The Westford Knight: Templars at the Newport TowerI uncovered much evidence consistent with Mann's theory, including so-called ""mooring holes"" in the upper Midwest and New England that serve no apparent maritime purpose (being far from water sources) but instead may be part of the Templar mapping system."
4,Interesting,"An interesting stretch of information, totally believable, but offers insight to how the Templars would have explored foreign lands. There's alot of material and lays out a logical sequence of possible exploration."
2,Scientific proof would help!,"Although Mr. Mann appears to have performed an immense amount of research, I find the research at this time to be just conjectured tales. To many suggestions, perhaps, maybe and assumtions in trying to weave together a scattered history from an Order that was destroyed by the pope and king of France. I would like to believe many of the suggestions in his book as there are many un-answered questions and bits of history that was lost and hidden under a veil of darkness and secrecy. Our North American scholars have led us in a fairy tale when it comes to the founding of North America and until they find hard evidence, evidence that is most likely kept in a secure vault, we can only try to see through that misty veil, some sort of conspiracy."
5,The Rig is the Ultimate Weapon,"This game has a cool weapon called the Rig that lets you grab your enemies and then stick them into the traps that they set for YOU. This was also the team that made the first Earthworm Jim game, it was also one of my favorites.It's a completely unique way to play a game like this. I had LOTS of fun with it. If you like Action games, then check it out!"
2,An overrated and repetitive platformer,"I buy every platformer that comes out for the Playstation and I must admit that I found this one to be rather disappointing. Given the amount of hype generated about this title by Dave Perry, president of Shiny Entertainment, I expected something extraordinary. The game does include unusual elements, like the Rig, and finding ways to torture your enemies is an interesting twist. The graphics are good and the sound is OK, although you'll find yourself tiring of the guitar riffs rather quickly. I found the gameplay to be repetitive and the game itself is short by today's standards. The gameplay is very similar to 2.5D platformers like Pandemonium, but not nearly as fun or immersive. Worth picking up if you're a Dave Perry fan. Otherwise, I'd recommend sticking to the truly classic platform games like Klonoa or the Crash Bandicoot series."
3,"Nice, but needs more thorough text editing.","While this text has the potential to be a very useful tool for practitioners and academics alike, I was a little disappointed to find multiple errors in the text. One critical error was the incorrect citation of a research finding. Specifically, on page 56, it states, ""In addition, individuals' motivation (i.e., direction, level, and persistence of effort exerted) is more strongly related to maximum than typical performance (Klehe & Anderson, 2007)."" This is not what Klehe and Anderson (2007) found in their study, they in fact found the opposite, which is consistent with motivational theory (that motivation is more strongly related to typical rather than maximum performance).This incorrect citation makes me wonder how many other research findings they discuss are miscited. I encourage anyone using this text (and any other) to always go to the original research articles to confirm findings before using them to make decisions."
3,Review,"Great data when you have the time to actually read it and make sense of it. No time to fully read and comprehend since it veers off into scientific explanations on workforce planning, effectiveness, etc."
2,What a mess.....,"This items works ok, if you like soft boiled eggs. The problem is the heating plate of the machine. It is simply not deep enough to deal with the water amount needed for hard boiled eggs. We have hot water on the counter everytime we cook hard boilded eggs with. Another short coming is the short handles on the lid. You have to be extremely careful to open the machine or you will scald yourself on the escaping steam. I've dealed with this hot water on counter problem for over one year and finally had it. I've purched the Krups machine (no problem here) and tossed this one. Think twice before bying. BTW this machine used to be called Salton until Toastmaster purchesed the company. Same product differenct company name."
1,This was not writen by Mr. Johnstone,"I now own all of the ""In the Ashes"" series and the last three books including this one have not, in my opinion, been written by Mr. Johnstone. I can live with all of the technical mistakes in the last few books. But I can not stand what has happened to the characters that Mr. Johnstone created and have developed as the story went along. You can see the ugly change start in ""Tyranny in the Ashes"" the only part written by Mr. Johnstone was the out take from ""Hatred in the Ashes"". The rest of the book was written by, the only thing that comes to mind and is polite is the writer is a hack. Mr. Johnstone please come back and write again. I will purchase books already written by Mr. Johnstone but no further books published under his name will I purchase."
1,Inconsistent Plot,"Having read all of Mr. Johnstone's ""Ashes"" series, I am disturbed to read this book (as well as the two previous to this). Is he still writing the books? He often refers to Operation Desert Storm...well, the war that changed the world in the original book was in the mid 1980s...years before DS. Same goes for military equipment referenced in the later books. I'm throwing away the books that start the inconsistency and keeping the rest of them...which is where I think WWJ intended for the series to end."
2,still worth having in a collection,"Johnstone has lost who he was writing about in this one. He or his publisher printed the book with many statements that were out of touch with the previous books and characters. Example, He contributed the marking of President Claire to Jersey when in fact Jackie Malone did the notching. I found many examples like this and was disappointed. However I will buy the next installment and hope it was all clerical errors and not a sign of things to come with this author."
4,You people obviously have not read that many WWJ books.,"This book just like every other ashes book is great. The complaints made are completley unfounded. First of all the complaint that some of his information does not match up with past books is ridiculous if you have read some of the authors other books. He does this often yet it really does not take away from the over all story. Then to complain about how Coop and Jersey talk to Ben. They have reffered to Ben as ""Ben"" many times throughout the book not to mention that in the past books WWJ writes that at times they see him as more of a father figure and not a general which clearly explains this change in his address. This is a good book for anyone that enjoys the series or even a newcomer. So ignore these other reviews who are grossly mislead."
2,I agree with the others,Mr. Johnstone whats going on here? If you (speaking to the reader now) what good fiction dealing with a world after WWIII then buy every book in this serise up to book number 25#. Then for strange reason the books nosedive. I think johnstone should just bow out of the serise while he has the chance and stick to writting westerns.
3,Text book,"It was for school, so it was more necessary than a book I would buy to read for fun, the prices at the campus bookstore were way worse though so it was worth it."
1,Sad day,Sadly i cannot write this book because i was sent the wrong edition. It looked nothing like the picture attached above.
1,very bad game,"Starwinder is one of those old Playstation games that ZERO people should remember. In fact, NO ONE remembers the game anyway. That's why only two people have reviewed the game on this site, and the last one was over 6 years ago.Starwinder really wants to be Wipeout, but the horrible controls and uninteresting race tracks make it a really disgusting game to look at. Playing the game is a really bad idea. Avoid."
1,too hard and very boring,pros: - the stupidity of the news reports is funny. - you can blow up almost everything you see.cons: - bad graphics even for its time. -horrible story line. -after the second world it is nearly imposible to win races. -framerate is very slugish. -lots of popup. -wepons have very little effect. over all this game ... don't buy it.
5,"Beautiful book, great information!","This is an extremely high quality ""art book"" which will be at home on any coffee table or in any library of people interested in baskets, Africa or any indigenous arts and crafts. The photographs are outstanding, the paper weight feels wonderful in your hand, it's a very well produced volume. I especially enjoyed the introduction by Paul Mikula which gave a great context for how difficult the baskets are to weave and spoke to the history of the weaving from more of the standpoint of the Zulu people. I have been carrying these types of baskets for over 3 years now and there has been a big void in the world for information on these baskets. This book fills the void plus some! Thanks to the authors for a great information source!"
1,retarted,"a few cheap characters, alot of pucnching moves but nothing special. a degraded version of street fighter- THE GRAPHICS STINK!"
3,A Superior but still Mixed Bag of Stephen Baxter Stories,"In collected stories, there is always the risk of getting nuggets of iron pyrite in with true treasures. Rarely does a collection have a complete slate of hits without a miss. Even the best author can have a few lesser lights mixed in with the best.Stephen Baxter's collection Traces shows this maxim quite well. Unlike the thematic Vacumn Diagrams, its a pretty diverse collection, including probably the best story of the lot, the imaginative ""Moon Six"". The titular story, on the other hand, is a forgettable tale at best. In between range stories of various strengths and weakness, ranging on sf treatments of subjects from Verne to Gagarin.American fans of Stephen Baxter like myself will appreciate having the collection, but this is definitely not the place to start with his work if you are new to his brand of idea bursting stories."
5,You have to read this book!!!!!!!!,"Before I read this book, I had read a lot about Elizabeth 1, so when I started it, I pictured Mary as a bitter, cruel, and heartless person who hated her sister. But as I read on, I saw she had good reason to be bitter, even hate her sister! I think she could've been a good person, if it wasn't for her father, King Henry 8! I think he was just on the verge on of insanity, then Anne Boylen pushed him over the edge because she didn't give him a male heir, and then............... Oh, you'll just have to read the book! Trust me, if you like mystery, drama, sadness, happiness, anger, hate, death, history, and love, this is the book for you! (P.S. This makes me cry everytime I read it!)"
5,"Mary, Bloody Mary; Fun or facts?","Mary, Bloody Mary by Carolyn Myers is a true story with lots of entertainment in it. This is a story about a young girl named Mary who grows up to be a woman, but from her point of view. This story shows her struggles when her father, King Henry VII, falls in love with a woman named Anne Boleyn. He will stop at nothing to rid of Mary and her mother for Anne Boleyn. Everyone in the village, including Mary, thinks Anne Boleyn is a witch, but if Anne Boleyn becomes Queen of England, Mary cannot take the throne. She is forced to sign papers, but she will not. Will she die for it, or will her father show mercy? Throughout this story, Mary encounters a hard life compared to the one she used to have. Her mother and her have been seperated, she gets the sweating sickness, and many other cliff hanging encounters. I would tell everyone that this is one of the best books there are and I would reccomend it to anyone 11 or older."
5,GREAT,"I love historical fiction so Ithough this book was really good. I also read ELIZABETH I in the DEAR AMERICA series, which is about Mary's half sister, althoughthis book is much better. Later in her life, they called her Bloody Mary, and this book showed what she might have been like s a kid."
3,"Mary,Bloody Mary","I read the Elizabeth book in the Royal Series Dear America books, and I read of how nasty Mary was to Elizabeth. We always here of Elizabeth, and the trials of her life, but never Mary. This book gives a behind the scenes look at King Henry throught the eyes of this ill-treated duaghter of his, Mary. I could really see why she was so awful during her reign. Childhood shapes the adult, and that's what happened with her. This book is an excelent historical-fiction, and really does give you a whole new perspective on the Tudor family life-styles."
5,A very exciting historical novel,"I love history. And Mary, Bloody Mary helped me learn more about her and why she grew up the way she did and why she became what she became. I am, naturally, a fan of Elizabeth I and I always thought of Mary as an evil stepsister, a Goneril or Regan. This book changed all that. I now think of Mary as an equal to Elizabeth, and a good thing, too. It took a lot to make me believe that Elizabeth I wasn't a saint, that Anne Boleyn wasn't a misused woman (well, she was, but not as much as I thought). A wonderful book for all ages."
3,mary bloody mary,"I believe that ""Mary, Bloody Mary"" is and accurate depiction of Mary Tudor's teen years. The book is also narrated by Mary. It recalls her trials and tribulations of having to deal with her father, King Henry VIII, divorcing her mother, the queen, and courting Anne Boleyn.I liked the ""new spin"" the author put on Mary. Everyone seems to remember her as the terrible, barbaric queen of England. But she was actually just misunderstood. Another positive point about this book is that it is actually a completely true story about Mary Tudor's life.I didn't like the way the book jumped from year to year. It made it kind of confusing to figure out how old Mary was when an event happened. I also thought the tone of the story was kind of boring. I would have liked it better if there were more descriptions and dialogue. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to learn about the early years of English monarchs."
5,"Moving, Important","This is a story that rarely gets told; The adolesent years of Queen Mary I. Everyone knows that she imprisoned her sister, and burned the Prostestants- But why? What was the foundation that led up to these events? The fact that Mary was bastardized and forced to be a maid to her baby sister Elizabeth is crucial, but is never mentioned in school history textbooks. If you love Tudor history, you'll love this book."
5,"Imaginative, hard to put down","One of my daughter's favourite books, she has been hooked on history ever since. It is an imaginative account of Queen Mary's childhood through her diary as a young girl. Carolyn Meyer makes it very easy for young readers to relate and intimately introduces them to the history of Tudor England. Who would have thought that our pre-teens could relate to a girl in 16th century."
5,Couldn't Put It Down!,"I had never heard of Mary Tudor before I bought this book, it was the title that attracted me, and I'm glad it did! This book gives you a different perspective on the life of Mary Tudor, she had so many horrible times in her life and now I don't blame her for some of the awful things she did! It's a wonderful book that will suck you in!"
4,"Mary, Bloody Mary","I liked the book because it was full of action and the the author was so great at writing this book, she is a wonderful writer.This is my opioin but I thought the best part of the book was at the end when everything was happening it was an action packed end with Mary becoming happy, but they said she was nice but she wasn't that's why she was know as bloody Mary.The most vivad part of the book was at the climax I didn'tunderstand it. This book had some volger language."
4,Wow,"Mary, Bloody Mary is a pretty awesome book. It's about the ""life and times"" of Queen Mary, aka Bloody Mary, former Queen of England. The begining is a little slow; the book doesn't get interesting until the around the fourth chapter or so. But it's a worthy read! Full of fun facts to know and tell"
4,Good read for pre-teens and teens,"Mary, Bloody Mary is the story of Mary Tudor's pre-teen and teenage years written for that age-group. Told from the first-person point of view, Mary tells of Anne Boylen's increasing power over the king, the casting-off of Mary and her mother, the birth and care of Elizabeth and Anne's eventual downfall. The book ends with the marriage of Henry to Jane Seymour, making ""Mary, Bloody Mary"" an inappropriate title as that nickname was not earned until many years later.On the whole, it's an fine book to give to early teens who are starting to, or maybe need to be encouraged to, develop an interest in history, the role of women throughout history, and strong female historical figures."
5,Mary Bloody Mary Lover,"This is a page turner! Seriously, it is. Mary Bloody Mary is so vivid and wonderfully written. I was so entrancedby Mary and her life I couldn't put it down and i finished it in 1 day! i suggest this for all teenage girls if they like history from the point of view of someone their age. Its really, really great. (I own it!)"
4,Great!,"This book was great, and I learned alot too. It shows what happened to Mary, and I also learned alot too. I'm 14, so enjoying a ""learning book"" is rare, so this is one you have to pick up! I would have given it five stars, except that for those of you who need a book that keeps you on your toes all the time, this isn't it. Most of the time you are, but not always"
4,Bloody,"You say well this is a great book (even though it is a historical book). It called Mary, Bloody Mary by Carolyn Meyer. It's a type of history book. Also it is a monarchy kind of book.Mary, Bloody Mary is about a princess, Princess Mary who wasn't aloud to be queen. Her mother who is Queen Catherine, got locked up in a prison because he wanted Mary to be queen.Mary got sent to lots of places. She had no cloths. Her father wanted a divorce so he could marry Lady Anne, but of course Queen Catherine said no...The books strength is it gives a lot of facts, (real facts) about history. Carolyn Meyer wrote a lot of non-fiction stories about Mary's family.The books weakness is it doesn't tell a lot about the other queens (King Henry married a lot of another people).I would recommend this book this to people who like to read history books because this has a lot of history facts in it."
2,"Mary, Bloody Mary","If you're looking for a good read you found it in Carolyn Meyer's Mary, Bloody Mary. When a young women named Anne Boleyn tries to break up Mary's royal family and steal her fathers heart along with the kingdom. Mary just won't stand for it. Mary is proclaimed illegitimate, at same time Anne orders for her mother (Queen Catherine) to be put in two different households.Through out the novel it is Mary's mission to get back her father and the kingdom. This thrilling novel will take you through the good and bad times of the 1500's. It's a natural page turner, a must read. This book is intended on a mature audience."
3,"Mary, bloody Mary","The setting was in Whales around 1500s. The main character is Mary princess of Whales, King Charels VIII, Lady Anne Boleyn, Salsberry, Queen Cathrine and many ladys in waiting. The story is how Mary is living a great life and this women just crashed it in to peices. The climax was when Mary's dad had just beheaded Anne Boleyn and he goes into this mad state were if she didnt sighn a paper she would be next. Finally after years she became queen but only for five years and died.I liked the storey but it lacked a few things. It lacked climax, the story was just a plane thing it had a few like scary things but you could pridict it to well. It also lack interest like it never was interesting and it had a boring Cycle. It was just her life with on going nightmares."
1,Awful product,This product is awful. Absolute rubbish. There is no practical magic here. After 50 hours of practice I was not at all able to cast magic missile at the darkness.
3,Candle Magic,"This is a great beginners book. It tells you everything you need to know, the how and why, of magic. Don't be like me buy the book then let it sit on the shelve waiting until you have more time. It's too good of a book to do that."
4,for the born again virgin not originals,"This book is really good for someone healing from a previous relationship. The author advises the reader to take time to devote to her individual development. This raised the question to me ""were you on hiatus during your relationship?"" I like the life planning material she includes. It is a good exercise for anyone to do.This book however is not for the inexperienced really. I think the experienced woman will connect with it more than the less experienced woman. I did not agree fully with her definition of celebacy and she even touches upon this subject in one of her anecdotes about a conversation with a friend of hers. I would not recommend this book to a woman who is a virgin or a teenage/ young adult category. It is not really written for that audience. Overall I think it is a good read."
3,Worth a read,"I wanted to evolve after reading this book, but I didn't. Old patterns and behavior die hard and usually with experience. However the author is real enough to admit this, Its a good read and something very worthwhile to experience. Cherish yourself!!"
3,Goes Good With Free On-line Course,"Fear and Trembling by Soren Kierkegaard originally published in the mid-1800s is widely considered a classic of existentialist literature. These comments pertain to the Penguin version of Fear and Trembling translated by Hannay.Though Kierkegaard talent is readily apparent, his work can be a difficult slog without the appropriate context or guidance. Personally, I have always found Kierkegaard difficult and as a result have tended to refer to secondary rather than primary sources in dealing with him. My experience with Fear and Trembling was different and markedly more fulfilling. I stumbled across a wonderful free, on-line University of California Berkley existentialist literature course available through i-tunes. The first half dozen or so lectures of this course deal with Fear and Trembling - I highly recommend it.Overall, it is an excellent version of an important work. I recommend the text as well as a look at the Berkley site."
2,Atheists should not read this book.,"I saw all of the rave reviews and the brevity of this book and thought it would at least be worth a try. It really wasn't. I'm sure Christians can appreciate it, or agnostics with very open minds. But atheists? No. That's why that quote ""Atheists should read this book"" really had me confused after I actually read the book. It is very repetitive and speaks about morality as if it's a universal truth. Kierkegaard writes idealist philosophy for Christians that are tired of feeling like pawns in the game of ethics."
2,"Uninteresting book , but a few good ideas","Fear and Trembling. The title sounds good. However, do not be fooled. Fear and Trembling is a mind-numbing read. That is not to say there is no value in it. It presents a few important ideas, such as the idea that every generation has essentially the same struggle as the last, but do not expect to be entertained in the least."
2,Reliability is a problem,"This is a really great calculator while it works. They are an extremely handy if you have to make conversions from English to metric or vice versa. As a field scientist, I need a durable calculator and have purchased five of these for my self and my staff with mixed success. Two have lasted over a year, although one of them stopped working after about two and a half years of use. The other three did not last a year. For some reason the display begins to fail with all of the calculators I have had problems. I'm currently looking for something very similar to this calculator that will last longer. Although they are very handy, their unreliability makes them a poor investment."
3,A gooe fan but not enough power for air evacuation....,"This a well built fan, the controls are excellent, and the feature of being able to remove the grill to clean it is INSPIRED! A can't-do-without feature. But it's a underpowered as an exhaust fan. But you could pay a lot more for another fan that wouldn't be much better then this one.I bought this fan because I smoke cigars, and wanted something to exhaust tobacco smoke out of the room. This might work for a small bedroom. The lack of ratings on wattage and air evacution in these window fans makes it difficult for the consumer to evaluate.I'm not unhappy or don't think I'm cheated, because for the price, you can't beat this fan. But if for air evacuation of a medium to large room, look elsewhere."
2,Crack Casing!!!,Yes. I opened immediately when UPS delivered the window fan and it got a severe crack casing!!Got to return to Target minus off my shipping charges! Sad!
4,good quality and great price. I love the thermostat feature.,I love the thermostat feature and the fact that you can intake and exhaust at the same time.
3,wish list,"So far this fan is a big help in the kitchen. For the bedroom I'd like to find a different fan that is much quieter, and that could be set at a much lower airflow.The side panel locks are hard to set from the inside the house--seems like a strange design, particularly for an upper floor window."
3,It Doesn't Fit the Window,"While I like the fan for it's intended purpose, when you fit it into the window, there is a sizable gap left on top of the pullout sides. That means that you have to add tape or insulation to fill the gap.You would think the company would provide a piece of insulation which would make the top weathertight, but they don't."
4,Honeywell Window Fan,"Window FanFor the price, this window fan is a great buy. I purchased this second unit to replace the same model which endured a lot of use. It's fairly quite for the amount of air it moves. A window fan is a great way to save money on your electric bill. I never use my air conditioner, even during the summer months."
4,Window fan,Works well. The only complaint is that the window extenders are very difficult to manipulate.
3,Buy when you are prego,"This book would have been MORE helpful if I would have purchased it when I first got pregnant. I of course have purchased practically every how-to, what to do, don't-do book on pregnancy, my new baby, and working after becoming a mom book there is. My husband and friends joke with me about my newly obtained library and how it has replaced the Harry Potter and Jodi Piccoult novels I used to have time for! This book provides alot of information and at this point (9 weeks post pregnancy) it's almost too late and not worth the money to only read the portions that apply to me."
3,Great for New Moms -- OK for older Moms,"Having two children ages 5 and 9, I'veread many many books about managing workand family. This book didn't add muchnew information. But if you're a new Momand just starting to try and figure outday care and work/life balance issues,then it's great."
2,Seemed rather simplistic/obvious to me,"I picked up a copy of this book because of all the great reviews. I have a 3 month old and started back to work a few weeks ago. Frankly, there wasn't much in here that I needed or didn't figure out on my own.I am giving it two starts, instead of one, because everyone is different and what I thought to be obvious advice may be a revelation to someone else. The one thing I have learned about parenting is that you have to figure it out what is best for you all by yourself. And if you need a book to help you, then this would certainly be a perfectly good one to pick up."
2,The Working Mothers Guide to Life,This book is very negative. It basically puts down your husband and family by telling you to make them do everything for you...and that's how you are supposed to work and have a baby at the same time.
5,Works Great,"I am neither dark nor lovely, but the product works well on my naturally curly hair. Oh, and the price is right!"
1,"Mistake, Wrong Fath de Fath!","I have been sooooooooo disappointed:I thought it was the same fragrance that my Mom used. I am not sure if it is still on the market. I am still looking, though for ""Eau de Toilette"" or perfume Fath de Fath of Jacques Fath that was on the market since 1953! The color was also much lighter, the bottle long and square. Fath de Fath by Jacques Fath for Women 3.4 oz Eau de Toilette Spray"
2,Bite The Bride,If you want to feel like a bride draped in an enormous wedding veil - all the while being bitten by black flies; buy it.
1,"Very light weight, you get what you pay for.",It is a flimsy weighted material that didn't work for us. I wanted to use it over some plants in my garden so the bugs eating up my plants would be kept out. Too light to work with.
4,this thing is huge,I got this to cover the rear of my truck with the camper shell up and the tailgate down so I could camp without mosquitoes getting in. It's very large and does the job.
5,bug free night,I hang this double net inside the roof of my Honda Element. Its big enough to cover my suv sized air mattress and worked well on its first trial. I was able to sleep with the doors and liftgate open and enjoy a bug free night in the woods of Pennsylvania.
4,Shipping could be a little faster.,The product was exactly as advertised but it took almost a week and a half to receive it. I run my own tool site for different tools and I ship the same day - why can't they speed up the process?!
3,Love stories,"This wasn't exactly an ordinary love story - there were extra elements. Like stealing a dog, and a nice relationship with the main man's daughter. Its written in a bright and energetic manner and made me laugh, which is unusual because romance novels usually make me very cross."
4,Fantastic,"This calender is for all Harry Potter fans. It has an old, kind of wizarding background on each page. The pictures capture exciting moments and leave you wanting to see more action. The colors of the calender set a calm and relaxing mood.For each day, there is a box with an old-stone-wall background. There is plenty of space for you to record all of your appointments and dates. The boxes aren't enormous, though, so don't think that the boxes look ugly.If you're a Harry Potter fan or if you are a lover of ""*magic*"", then i suggest this incredible calender."
4,Harry Crazy,"I think that the Calendar was terrific. With all the great shots and things written in on certain dates, that was a ""thumbs up""! Harry Potter is [great]! I've read all the books and love them! This calendar was great too! Anything that is Harry Potter, people will go crazy for."
3,h.r=harry potter,i enjoyed the book very much > it was thrilling .i recommend the book to all my freinds .thanks>sereen
5,Loved it,"A born Montanan but living elsewhere, I love revisiting the places I'd seen and some I haven't. Stories of events in small and large towns, very interesting!"
4,Perfect for roadtrip with Dad,"This book was perfect for a roadtrip with my Dad, a native Montanan, when we went to visit his alma mater Montana State University. After years of driving to and through and around Montana every summer it was fun to read about historical tidbits for all those country roads and US highways!"
3,Good product...difficult to clean!!,"I've use this product just one time. Excelent quality and very light weight. It heats almost instantly (good for any alcohol stove enthusiast). I like the size of the pot and fry pan. The only bad thing about this cookset, it's not the price but the difficult to remove stains. Beacuse of the heat it can reach, the food sticks to the surface and blemish it and is very hard to clean it, I have to use degreaser (when I got back home) because a scraper did not work. I prefer Teflon coated cooksets than this. I only recommend this cookset if you don't mind the cleaning duty and you hike near a good source of water like a river or lake(don't forget to bring a good amount of detergent and degreaser). Otherwise, choose Teflon coated pots/fry pans."
4,Light and Sturdy; Not so verstatile,"Light and sturdy but stained on first use. Narrow/Tall design less versatile than broad-base pots, ie more difficult to fry in."
3,too bulky for hiking,This is a good set of pots for hiking but just not realistic for back country camping on the trail. I eventually went with a Jet Boil cook system which is much lighter and more compact than this with a butane system.
1,Waste of Money,"As many other reviewers stated, mat is a little bumpy, but I expected that and I'm sure eventually it'd go flat (or you could iron it), and that alone I was ok with. What I'm not ok with is the fact that even if you do put it right in the hole, it either just sits in the hole or rolls down to the return device and just sits there. After moving the return device around at different angles I eventually got it to return one out of every 4 balls, and even then it only returned it about half way to me, even on short carpet.... I will be looking for a better return putting green."
1,A complete waste,The artifical grass was nothing like the photo on the box. It was a cheap felt with many buckles and bumps making it impossible to put on. Save your money and buy a piece a felt from an arts and craft store.
3,Simple & Cheap,It's not fancy but for the price your can't be it. We used it in our office so it was easy to put away and stow. It isn't fancy but it works for simple putt putt in the office or wherever
3,You Get What You Pay For,This putting mat is what it is. The carpet is thin and tends to bunch up on our hardwood floors. The returns works as well as can be expected.
2,Good Money - Poor Product,"I purchased this product to help me get ready for this golfing season. I was very disappointed with what I got. The base of this Wilson Auto putt is made of cheap, thin plastic and the green felt putting surface wouldn't lay flat after a week. Not happy with this product at all! I put it back in the box and likely give it away."
4,"WILSON GOLF AUTO PUT, DECENT FOR THE MONEY","I have just received this item and has to concur with some of the other reviews: the green carpet is thin, therefore have some bumps; the black plastic of the hill (where is the hole) is not really hard and/or good quality, so if you step on it, for example, you will damage it severely. The automatic systems works ""ok"", because the balls that you miss has more speed than the ones you put into the hole. Therefore, the first ones came out of the ""put"" and the others will stay there waiting for you to come; and it can be anoying. The best thing you can do is leave it permanently display in a place where is no danger that someone could step on it (perhaps your office), and it will help to flat the green carpet to eliminate the bumps. The product is OK in relation to the money you spend."
5,Wonderful,"The perfect book of poetry for any mood. Although Piercy is a feminist, her poems are balanced, thoughtful and compassionate--also passionate. If you want to give yourself a gift, make it this one."
1,"Jane Eyre: I laughed, I cried, I threw-up","I heard this was an excellent novel. So when my class was assigned to read it, I did. It was beyond reproach. I could not believe the garbage forced on innocent readers like me. Sure, the writing is mature, but the contents were sub-par; even for Victorian gothic. If you are assigned to read this ""book"" (aka: Victorian refuse and female whining to the max) just Cliff Note it."
5,Great Classic Mix,"This is the perfect mix of decent Alpha Blonde stuff, recommended for new and old fans alike. If you need only one album, i would say this is the one =)"
5,EXTREAMLY TALENTED !,Alpha blondy is a must have in any rastas collection. You may not understand what he is singing about but you will get over that shortly....its all good .... MUCH RESPECT ALPHA & THE SOLAR SYSTEM.
4,Pretty Good,"I didn't care for half of these songs, but the other half like""Afriki"" are really really good. The artist is NOT Mozartnor classical in nature. It is reggae--sheesh!"
3,"Flawed, but still useful","I was somewhat disappointed with this book, although I still found it to be useful for learning TurboGears. I won't mince words: the editing sucks. If you can get through the typos, though, you'll learn a fair amount and be better positioned to do something useful with TurboGears after you've read the book. Treat the book more as a tutorial than a reference."
3,Frustrating Read,"I'm working on a Turbogears app. I find it a good framework. The book, however, is frustrating to work with. I rarely have time to read computer books sequentially. I generally jump around trying to find answers to my questions. I'm not finding answers... just partial examples throughout.For example, I would expect an AJAX example to have all the pieces necessary to implement an AJAX conversation with the file names clearly labeled. I would expect a diagram of how the pieces interact. What I find is little snippets of code without context and no diagrams anywhere in the book.I think the authors did a reasonable job of explaining Turbogears from their perspective. It was the editors' job to push them to explain things from their audience's perspective. This has the look of a rush job."
3,TG Review,"The book is a basic start, some of the examples have errors in them and there is a leap from examples that map to the taught content to a project called whatwhat that has much more involved code without giving proper background."
1,This adapter doesn't work,"On purchasing this adapter, I thought I had a good item for a cheap price. It really is true that you ""get what you pay for."" This thing fails to work completely on a blackberry 7100g. It says it is compatible in the advertisement and on the box. Don't believe it. It is junk. Avoid at all costs."
1,The Charger simply didnt work,I got this charger today for my Blackberry 7100t phone...And it simply doesnot work. I am extremely dissapointed with the quality. I will be travelling abroad and dont have much time to go thru the whole procedure of Amazon of replacement.
4,The original that started it all,"Street Fighter 2 ushered in a whole new world of video games. I don't remember how much time I spent trying to get better than my friends who started playing before me. All of the fighting games out there now? They are there because of SFII.The controls are easy and there is no block button. Story doesn't matter. This game is there to fight. Sure, it's an old 2D fighter, nothing like Soul Blade/Edge, or Tekken, but it's a classic and fun. If you grew up on Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, you need this game. You'll probably only play the Turbo mode, but it's worth it. The only problem with the Playstation version is the lack of the 6 button control the old Genesis had. Not having the 3 punches and kicks all in a row is a slight hassle, but not enough to detract from the game too much."
5,GREATEST FIND SINCE DINOSAURS.,"I didnt know this game even existed!!!WOW!!! when I saw It I knew I had to have IT, the gameplay is great and it still holds up to this day, because every fighting game and their mama uses their controller scheme to execute special moves. Then to have all 3 in one, i am literally drooling right now, nostalgia aside, this game is a masterpiece and to have all 3 ON one disc is a godsend, THANK YOU CAPCOM."
2,DULL!,"this collection is so boring all it contains is street fighter the world warrior, street fighter champion edition and street fighter turbo hyper fighting. those street fighters are outdated they were release far back in 1991 and 1992. and the gameplay is soooo slow the only one you might play is turbo hyper fighting. because the other two gameplay is very slow. this collection is dull, if i were you i would take the previous collection which contains super street fighter, super street fighter turbo and alpha 2 gold those games are much better and much faster. that is the better collection this volume2 collection [is no good]."
1,Why did I bother?,"When I finished this book I found myself wondering why I had bothered. The setting is generic; Hagy has not captured the magic that is Keeneland. One wonders whether the ""heroine"" is capable of sustaining a relationship with ANYone, human or equine - Hagy really wants us to believe that Kerry loves Sunsquall, but since they are never together during the timeframe of the book this is questionable. I found the plot entirely without climax. The book just fades to a stop; there is no ending. Not worth the time, IMO."
3,Bionicle Encyclopedia,Good book. The pictures of the bionicles in the encyclopedia could be bigger. They are very hard to see.
4,Bionical Encyclopedia,"Our 11 year old son is a big Bionicle fan and just loves this book, it is full of all the bionicals and an in depth description for each one with fun stickers to."
3,Price Controversy?,"I don't own the book and therefore I am not reviewing it, however I found it strange that if you look at the back cover of the book, the sticker price is $6.99, yet Amazon is charging $7.99 for it. Seems strange to me. Just my two cents."
5,Great value,"We used these in our DataCenter, they are a great value and very well made. I will keep buying these."
5,Vera Lynn,"I had heard a review of her music on the radio and knew that I love music of this era. She has a beautiful voice. Too often the lesser vocalists get missed in the music education, I am sure glad I found this one."
2,Highly overated,"This is a very boring album, compared to any of the spaced-out creative dub from Lee Perry. Go to sleep, and wonder at how many time a phase shifter can be used boringly. Sleep weak."
3,000DY6/CUSTOMER-REVIEW-FORM,"I HAVE THE RECORD OF UPTOWN ROCKERS AUGUSTUS PABLO AND A BOOK FROM DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN I,M NOT INTERESTED. THANK YOU."
5,this is it,"this is the one! If you get one dub album, get this one, if you want to get into dub, get this one, if you like dub, get this one, if you dont like dub, get this one. King Tubby at the controls, Augustus Pablo at the keys and melodica, the Rockers on the rhythms, it doesn't get any better than this. With plenty of minor key progressions (none of that 'happy' dub), floating vocals and horns, and rolling beats, this album is killer."
4,"Great, but the Deluxe version is better","I have the deluxe version, which has four more tracks. These four tracks include two of my personal favourites. Since most places (including amazon) offer the deluxe and regular versions of the album for the same price, why not get the extra four tracks? If you want my rating on this version as it stands it would be a five star rating for sure, but I gave it four because there really isnt a reason not to buy the deluxe version instead."
5,Dub Evolution,"Think King Tubby should be credited more on this CD; credits were not clear to me; but that is no big drawback, this is 5 star; ""This is Augustus Pablo"" though, is probably a safer bet, better release however.Augustus Pablos instrument, the melodica; is sort of like a piano and flute combined, bring up, what some might call a middle eastern sound: One won't be dissapointed; on the straight and narrow path, songs with lyrics, known names, Bob Marley, etc. is a safer bet; but apparently, this disc has historical significance and Augustus is a splendid artist with his flute. It might make one think, of the pyramids and palm trees, Robbie Shakespeare and others appear on this disc.If you are in the mood for lyricless reggae, a legend, dub evolution, try this.A lot more reviews here, I moved my review from the deluxe edition over here as well."
4,Seconding Dr. Akdogan's Review,"I can add little to Dr. Akdogan's thorough review, except to say that I agree with it, as do other professional scientists."
4,Poetry and Typography,"Typographically beautiful, lovely letterpress wrapper, Robert Bringhurst fans will definitely want to acquire this underpriced gem. Also highly recommended for fans of poetry, language and languages/linguistics."
3,An Eye Opener,"This is a technical medical thriller involving gene therapy. Dr. Kevin Kincaid is an engaging central character. He is a neurosurgeon but more importantly, he is also a brilliant research scientist who has developed a method to deliver corrective genes to the nucleus of cells of embryos in order to cure the genes causing inherited disabilities and prevent the disability from being passed on to future generations. Kincaid soon discovers that he is being used. Conspiracy and dirty deeds abound. A large part of this story involves detailed, technical gene science. This is not a lightweight read. But for those willing to pay attention, it is a real eye opener."
1,Don't Bother,"With all due respect, I think Dr. Erlich should stick to science, or perhaps get a ghostwriter or at least a decent editor.If this book has any continuity, I couldn't find it. Characters come and go, people change sides without apparent reason, and the protagonist, when not giving pedantic lectures, seems confused and obtuse.There is no real story here - the book simply appears to be a vehicle for the author's views and opinions. A non-fiction work would have been much better for his purposes."
4,Wow!,"In the tradition of Crichton and Cook, Erlick comes up with a scientific thriller that is believable. This is what makes it so scary. I couldn't put this book down once I picked it up. I also loved the fact that it's set locally (for me anyway).I can't wait to see what else Mr. Erlick comes up with for his next novel.Trust me! Buy this book. You won't be disappointed. You're in for the ride.Thanks for reading!"
4,"Don't read the reviews, read the book for yourself.","I bought this book a couple of weeks before a 5 hour flight and I intended to read this book on the plane. Well, I should not have opened the covers to take a peek because I was hooked.The science in Germline was interesting but for those who are not into cloning and gene therapy, you can skip the science dialog and the story would still make sense. What really facinated me were the thought provoking questions that the story brings forward.The explosions and chase scenes in this story were terrific. As I read it, a Hollywood movie played in my mind. If entertainment is what you need, this is it."
2,"Erlick's ""GermLine""","GermLine has lots of neat science, a convoluted plot with too many double crosses, a protagonist and love interest that are hard to like and numerous monologging villains. I really wanted to like this, but it didn't really gel for me."
1,,Can't write a review- it's been a month since I ordered it and it's not even scheduled to be shipped for 2 more weeks. Wish I could help.
1,more sorrow,Why do these guys keep torturing me?I am deeply saddened by the young Herbert's abuse of his father's copyrights.I'm just sick.
5,Enchanting and True to the Original Series,"Beautifully done with great plot twists and a terrific tempo. This book, along with the first, goes a long way in giving us a history to the mystery of the characters from the original series. In addition, they stand alone very well."
5,Great,"It may be a bit weak on some of the writing due to the influence of Kevin Anderson, but the plot and overall appeal of the book is great. I recommend the book completely"
2,Is this a star trek book?,"Brian distorts the Dune serious making unbelievable leaps and writing things that any Dune fan know just couldn't be or clash with Frank's vision. The characters are one dimensional and the story line is preposterous. It's as badly written as star trek books. This book might be entertaining to those looking for a fun read but anybody who holds Dune true and dear to their hearts will dislike this. This was obviously a tool to fatten his pockets. He should have listened to his father when he wrote ""YOu don't write for success."" Let Brian have his fun with the prequels but let us all hope he doesn't truely desicrate Dune by attempting Dune 7."
2,Idiots from outer space,"Loved the original Dune. This book was a definite disappointment. The Harkonnens are brutal, stupid too. Wait until you read about The Padishah Emperor Shadam. He makes the Harkonnens look like geniuses. It does not make sense to me how two houses that treat their subjects so horribly can even hope to stay in power. I was stuck in an Airport and needed something to read and I gave it a shot. Some interesting background info but mostly a bummer. Save your money."
2,Disappointing,"Maybe I expected too much, but when I saw another Herbert associated with the Dune series, I automatically assumed that there would be deep sociological undercurrents. I thought the characters would have real, independent thoughts and actions. I was not expecting a blood-bath with predictable and rather shallow characterizations. My advice would be to re-read the other Dune books and let the classics stand by themselves."
1,An insult to writing in general,"Atrocious prequel to the original dune series.Even when not compared to the original a total failure.Almost every aspect of this book is a failure;-Just plain bad writing.-Sloppy housekeeping, errors galore.-Wholly unbelievable characters. They just do whatever the plot requires of them at any given moment.-Same goes for the universe they inhabit. There's no internal logic breaking my suspension of disbelieve time after time.-Lazy and contrived solving of plot lines just to make everything fit together.-Annoying rythm with one cute little cliff hanger after another. You just stop caring after a while.I wonder what editors even do these days."
3,A lull in the series,"I've spoken to several people who faded out of the series with this book. I thoroughly enjoyed the volume but enjoyed House Corrino quite a bit more. Thus, I would say, read this book in order to achieve the last of the series if nothing else. One thing's for sure, those Harkonnens are bad, bad people..."
3,Confused,"Did I miss something or does it seem that in ""Dune"" Gurney and Liet meet for the first time. Liet seems very annoyed by Gurney in the scene where Liet takes Leto, Paul, and Gurney to see a spice harvesting operation.I am not sure why House Harkonnen would include plot that has Gurney and Liet meet and work together as smugglers."
3,"Decent, but i expected more","Reading the other reviews, I must agree with them to some degree, I have read all the Dune books and they are one of the few series of books that made me think to a great degree. These two new books don't do that for me but I enjoy them all the same. He is a decent writer, but his father was by far the master writer of the family. I do hope that he does not try and undertake a book that would follow Chapterhouse Dune. I think that would cheapen the series. This trilogy seems to spark an intrest for readers to get into the Dune series itself, and I hope thats what it continues to do."
4,more plotting and scheming but still good,It's written alright and I enjoy some of the threads that come out in later books but might be reaching point of Dune fatigue.
2,Below the standard,I found this book to be a poor representation of Frank Herbert's Duniverse. It reads more like fan fiction than a novel by the man's son.
4,A fine sequal to House Atreides,"I liked this book alot and cannot wait for House Corrino. Granted, the way Leto ""saved"" Gurney was rather weak, but that's the only complaint. Everything else about this book made it difficult to put down."
4,Like father like son,"Some amount of space is devoted in this new prequel comparing the achievements of the father to the son. As noted over and over again, the son carries on better than before. Im not ready to say Brian Herbert is better than his father but its getting real close."
2,Disappointing,"I expected this book to tell the history of House Harkonnen; instead I got a collection of rather uninspired, boring short stories about the backgrounds of the key members of the Atreides household (and learned how ""Beast"" Rabban came by his nickname)."
4,Good in it's own right,"I love Dune. When I introduce friends to science fiction, it is one of the two or three books I recommend. I didn't expect something on the order of Dune in the prequels, but I was pleasantly surprised with House Harkonnen. I thought House Atriedes was simplistic and not overly well written, but in House Harkonnen the writing and the story line took off and gave me a compelling narrative. For the purists who complain that it doesn't approach Dune--well, nothing does. Even Dune's sequels, IMHO, weren't up to the standard of the original. House Harkonnen is good, plain, entertaining science fiction. Loved it."
2,full of sound & fury...,"I think Frank would be upset. As much as I tried to enjoy this book, my frustration increased with every chapterette. It stands upon the shoulders of giants but fails to reach any stature of its own. The comic bookish chapters are irritatingly fragmented & more akin to literary sound-bites than thoughtful character & plot development. For the record: Islam is a theistic religion, Buddhism is a non-theistic religion- a combination would explode in philosophic nonsequitor."
4,"It's not Frank, but then who could fill his shoes?","I still find the original Dune series far more complex in every way - character development, plot and even the vocabulary used. However, House Harkonnen is as good as it gets! Could not put it down, and like all Dune books, all hell begins to break loose in the last 100 pages - and all hell does break loose for the Atriedes family. Also, this is the first Dune book that has ended so very sadly. It's an interesting twist. I can't give it 5 stars, because only Frank gets 5, but I do give it 4. I loved it."
3,i like finally hearing about Lady Jessica's background,"What's all the complaining about? That Duke Leto grew into a mean spirited but nice person? Its a complex period with nasty people in it. They're at war and people get that nasty way after seeing their loved ones die,The Duke with his father and mother,and Lady Jessica wih her parents"
2,WHERES THE BEEF?,This book reads like a STAR WARS novel for 15 year olds. Definitly not up to par to the epic mesmerizing sci fi classic.
4,The most readable Dune book,"Let's face it: despite its brilliant plot and philosphical musings, the original Dune was not a book that you could simply sit down and read. It required thought and thorough concentration. Let's face something else: the current generation does not particularly enjoy working through a huge, complex, multi-faceted book. I think that House Harkonnen was written for kids more than adults: fast-paced and not spending much time on reflecting about the nature of the universe. Though traditionalists may wince, I think that the new book is keeping up with the times nicely. This is definetely the most readable book in the series. I've only had it for 3 days and I'm already on page 400!"
2,Not up to Dune Standards,"I have eagerly awaited all the new books in the Dune Prequel series but this one saddly disappointed me with it's many references to old earth, in the original books earth had been abbandoned at least 25,000 years but this book made it sound like a far more recent event. And I found original books plots within plots to be almost completely missing. Over all the worst of all the Dune books."
5,Expands wonderfully and logically on the prior Dune novels,"Herbert's son pairs with author Anderson to write the second book in the trilogy prequel, this exploring Leto Atreides, Jessica and Duncan Idaho on their individual and collective journeys through their Dune world. This expands wonderfully and logically the prior Dune novels created by Herbert and adds new dimension and adventures. Dune fans will find this involving and engrossing."
1,"Great Tale Well Told, Epic Scale, Historically Full","To all who find fault with this book - bah, humbug!I found the storylines engrossing, well-written, well paced, and fascinating. I am going to start on ""House Corrino"" after I write this quick review, mostly becaue of the excellent beginning in ""House Atreides,"" and the superior follow-up in ""House Harkonnen."" The well thought out progress of converging characters and their plotlines, and the exciting climax of each thread added up to an inspired finish, and felt just right, leaving me eager to see how the next book would set up the original story in ""Dune.""For all fans who are not critics, you will love this book. For all critics who may or may not be fans, well, when have you ever truly enjoyed anything?Set aside your judgement and get this book - used ones are available on Amazon for $.01 cent! There is no better investment in our current economy."
2,Just okay at best,"I had low expectations for this book. It's definitely not as good as House Atreides.The main problem is that the characters actions don't make sense. For example, the character of Dominic Vernius is completely... manufactured, forced, contrived. I don't know which word fits best. He's supposedly a renegade smuggler with a price on his head, but yet he trusts with disclosing his plans to everyone. And he hides in the most obvious places. It really shows the creative limitations of the authors in weaving the story arcs together. I understand it's complicated and I couldn't do better, but I shouldn't be able to see things coming every time. It's not as innovative as Heretics or Chapterhouse were. I wish these authors would take the artistic license to be daring, with twists, and literary risks that make continuing the Dune franchise a worthwhile endeavor worthy of the series started by Herbert. The stories are too safe a predictable."
2,"if you're going to write a prequel, keep your plot straight!","I was disappointed in all the inconsistencies between these Prequel Dune novels and the original. They're so busy building up suspense that the facts mentioned in prior novels are ignored; how Jessica was bought by the Duke's men, not placed there by the Bene Gesserit, history of the Fremen per the encyclopedia that Herbert the original put out, and many other details. They seem intent on creating a story that is growing more divorced from the original plot line the closer it comes to converging in timeline."
2,The weakest of the three,"I liked House Atreides and House Corrino pretty well (especially House Atreides). House Harkonnen left me unimpressed. It got bogged down in a lot of nonessentials and simply did not seem to go anywhere. Nor does the novel ever explain how Gurney Halleck became a competent swordsman/warmaster on a par with Duncan Idaho. I just didn't get it.The parts about Emperor Shaddam were interesting, and of course Duke Leto Atreides is unforgettable. But overall this one is the weakest of the three in the Prequel to Dune series. I do like the prequel trilogy, just not this component of it."
3,Does not fit all Propipe variants!,"This end cap looks great, but it is not for metric bikes. The product description does not mention that this is for Harley Davidson Propipes only. If you've got a Propipe on a metric bike, this cap will not fit."
1,Not recommended.,"I just finished slogging my way through this, and I am thoroughly disappointed in everything about it. The exposition was clumsy, the plot was nebulous, and at the end of the book, the story just stopped. It wasn't brought to a conclusion in a sensible way, no loose ends were wrapped up - instead, a couple of Shocking Revelations come forth that ask more questions than they answer.Setting aside concerns about the plot, this book would have been much, much better if the concepts had simply been handled competently; a decent Star Trek author could have taken these ingredients and written a spellbinding story with them. As it stands, though, the best thing about this book is the cover art. I find it hard to believe the sequel actually got published, and I'm glad I bought my copy of this book used. It is one of the few books I've purchased that will not remain in my collection; back to the used bookstore it goes."
2,"Poorly written, ultimately boring","I started this book with high hopes but they started flagging just a few chapters into it. The heroine goes from being a highly disciplined officer to a bitter cynic to a total doormat to an infatuated ... within the first half of the book, none of which is believably written. The plot is lifted from a million other space operas. The last few chapters are hard to get through because the author is throwing new disasters at the heroine every few pages, seemingly just to tie up loose ends. I barely managed to finish it, which is the only reason it got two stars."
4,"Super-thick blanket--really nice, more of a playmat than blanket","This blanket is almost more like a playmat, in that it's so fluffy thick that it seems more suited to laying on rather than under---it's beautiful and soft and nice quality. I like it!"
1,Terrible Book!,This was the worst programming book that I have ever purchased. It did not go into any detail of any of the topics it covered. It barely touched on anything. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage.
4,OK Mfc book,"I was looking for a book on Visual C++ 6. I have plenty on MFC. This book covers MFC ok (Prosise' ""Programming Windows with MFC"" is still the best, imho). The first chapter is MS overview (advertising) of Visual Studio. The second states the obvious about the debugger. Chapter 19 covers scripting for the IDE. All the rest is MFC. The index (10 pages as compared to 27 in Prosise) includes very few classes or member functions limiting its usefulness as a reference. The author does have some useful information on Win98 and MFC scattered about, though. I suggest this book as a survey to those new to windows programming with mfc. There is little said about Visual C++ itself."
4,Better Without Trumpet,"With apologies to trumpeters, I am a lover of guitar music. In this CD, I feel the horn gets in Cruz' way. Cruz is the finest technical, most sensitive guitarist I have ever head all rolled into one. Every second Hooten toots takes time from what I really want to hear, and that is Edgar Cruz making music on his guitar. To those who love duets pairing trumpet and guitar, this may be the CD for you. But this CD will be in my bottom drawer."
4,The Gift of Ragamuffin Prayers,"Looking for a gift idea that is a great reminder of God's love for us? Here's one - a coffee-table book inspired by Brennan Manning's The Ragamuffin Gospel. Compiled by Jimmy Abegg, a member of the late Rich Mullins' Ragamuffin Band, this book is a collection of Abegg's beautiful black and white photographs, along with poems, prayers, and essays by Henri Nouwen, St. Francis of Assisi,Christian artists such as Michael W. Smith and Ashley Cleveland, as well as an interview with Manning himself. All of them deal with prayer: both the struggles of when it feels they are going unanswered and those when God's voice can clearly be heard. Know someone who needs cheering up? Know someone going through a trying time? This makes a great gift for them or for anyone who considers themselves spiritual ragamuffins."
3,Exclusively Yours,"Greg Roberts runs the construction firm that's tearing apart old neighborhoods in Des Moines, and Julie hates him on principle. She hates him even more when the bulldozer moves in next door. But what can you do with a man who keeps doing you favors?"
5,Loveloveloved it!,"I gobbled up this collection in just a few evenings. Once, I was so absorbed in it at one that I missed my subway stop. The stories are both wickedly funny and deeply moving. And they ask many serious questions about contemporary morality that I have grappled with but hadn't seen addressed quite this way before."
5,Muta's Work,"Muta'a type of recording far exceeds the average person who gravitate towards listening to reggae. For one to really comprehend his calibre music, (dup-poet)one has to have a grasp of one's consciousness that surround a given culture (reggae,and not just the rythym or sounds of instrument) toppled with pain and suffering. Muta often rhetorate the historical hurt that was and still being inflicted upon the inhabitants of the Island. When one listened, one listens to the beat or rithym of the music as oppposed to the words. Muta's extreme consciousness of his surrounding and his people propelled him into a stateof higher realm thus, earn him the liberty to voice.......dub-poet."
1,Don't Bother....,"Mutabaruka is just another captalist trying to appeal as a great poet. His first LP ""Outcry!"" is the only one worth getting. Muta is an old blowhard who lost his viability in the real reggae community years ago. I live in NY where reggae is alive and Muta couldn't draw a crowd here for a stage show and he knows it. The one star I gave is for the appearances of Luciano and Dennis Brown - true reggae greats. If you want to buy a reggae CD, I suggest you look to thier recorded outputs."
1,interesting,"placed my order with amazon 11/15, and it still hasn't been shipped out. Lousy service !"
3,"Action packed, I'll give it that","So, first off, this is a Christian book, didn't realize that till about half way through. It was fine, got a little awkward for me cause I couldn't figure out why they were pushing the one true God more and more often. Okay, so that's fine, a good story and it's got a lot of good action. The one thing that really got to me though, was the switch in character in the main girl towards the end. She just ended up saying things that were rather cocky and out of character. Totally ruined it for me, they were things that were just kind of in the face wrong for her character. Overall a good book."
4,good read,"Great storyline. There are a few holes in the plot, but it was a good read overall. Found it was an interesting approach to sharing the gospel through the storyline."
2,the story that never ends,"I got this bc it was listed as Christian fiction. I was anticipating a thrilling read, but the characters are not well developed and the action feels unreseached. Then the whole finding God plot line....are we writing a gospel story or a spy story? the region was so heavy handed I skipped over it. I struggled to finish it, and had to give up at 94%...I just couldn't take anymore."
3,Marduk's Tablet,"This book had you constantly guessing what was going to happen next. I enjoyed the interesting history, but also the personal spiritual journey. I love the idea of uncovering lost history, in the middle of the hot sandy desert. All the different characters work well together, keeps you on your toes with who is 'good' and 'bad'."
1,"Not for the Art Student, in poor taste","Not good for the Art Student, when drawing without a model this is not even a good book since it has nothing to do with body building. Much of the photography is out of focus. In general a poor choice for the Art Student."
5,Cost-a-lottus,"This is great, but who can afford it? It averages out to slightly more than $12.00 per episode (with Amazon's price), but you'd think there would be a better price break for purchasing them all at once. I will never buy something this prohibitively expensive, no matter what it is or how much I admire the series."
4,A Guide to Heaven,This scrapbook is a great way for people to learn about this great show and the cast. The pictures are great and if you love 7th Heaven this is a great book.
5,Replacement Blades for the Savvy Shopper,"If you already own the peanut trimmer and the blades have either become dull or you need to replace them for whatever reason, this is definitely an economical choice. Save yourself some money and just buy the replacement blades rather than the entire trimmer. Once you open the package it literally takes one minute to remove the old blade, brush out any hair or dirt from the trimmer and attach the new blades. It couldn't be much easier."
5,shipped quick,This was the best price I could find. I had the blade in 3 days. If I break my clipper again I will buy another from here.
5,Saved me money.,"When my Wahl peanut cutter stopped cutting, I searched Amazon for a replacement. The one I own is 13-15yrs old. In my search I noticed a blade replacement for a fraction of what a new cutter would cost. Ordered it. When it arrived, the replacement took less then a minute and the cutter works like new."
5,Must read for those interested in Fair Trade,"Generally I think it is another great book from Stiglitz. The MakePovertyHistory campaign, Bono, Bob Geldof and their Live8 concerts has shined a bright light on trade justice.The World Trade organisation literally has the livelihoods of billions of people in its hands. This book shows how the trading relationships between rich and poor countries have become so unfair that the rich countries are creating more poverty. Free trade does not automatically lead to poverty eradication or environmental sustainability. In fact, if done wrong, it can increase poverty and cause harm to countries at different stages of development.If you want to understand the issues behind fair trade and the problems facing people in poor countries, this is an excellent place to start."
4,good overview of the issue,"I did not read the entire book, but the sections I read where very helpful in writing my paper. The authors do a great job in being clear and concise and using terminology that is easy to understand."
3,Confusing,"Though I think that Stiglitz is very smart and seems to make good points, do not let this be your first read on Fair Trade. Meant for experts. It is all over the place, and sometimes you do not know what ideology he is endorsing, what is neo-liberal and what is not, or what he is talking about. He needs to learn how to write so that common man can understand it. There are parts of the book where I was stumped, and I consider myself to be very informed on global issues."
3,BGreat but not worth 22$,"This is the Extended episode to Gundam Seed Destiny, for those not in the know. But while it wraps up everything and extends the already awesome fight scenes. The reason this gets low marks in my books is the price.Seriously 47mins for 22$..you can get 2h30m long blu rays on sale for that..even anime blue rays on sale or normal for that.I highly recommend this to any fan of the series..but shop around for a better rate"
5,They know how to make Progressive Rock,"When i saw NO NAME playing live in 1998, opening for Marillion i loved."" The other side"" is a good album, melodic, with a great piano and the band know how to make music. One music have 35 minutes, a classic, with a very strong vocal. The vocal have a fantastic presence in a live concert. They have a good future."
1,Tragic,"This movie was slow and depressing. It's not about the triumph of the human spirit, it's about how truly mean lonely self-absorbed people can be. This is the type of realism I can do without. In the final analysis there was a point to this movie, and without spoiling it, well, the point is offensive. I've witnessed too much real love and courage to pretend that this movie has any kind of meaningful voice."
4,replacement pocket,"This fit well and fills the void left from removal of the stock CD player. I would suggest that after inserting this pocket most of the way in, put the dash cover on and push it the rest of the way in with that. That will ensure a tight fit with no space between the pocket and dash cover."
3,"It's works, but a little snug","This tray works great to fill in where the factory CD player is installed on most mid 90's through late 90's Tahoe, Yukon, and Suburban. It is a little tricky to install. First you have to figure out when way it lines up, and as shown here in the picture is the correct way. After that you have to push it back into the dash. The only issue is that it does not snap in like the factory CD player, and when you are pushing it in you have to use quite a bit of force to get it all the way back into place. It also has vent ports on the back both on the upper and lower side so it is not completely sealed. I made use of those by running USB and iPod wire through them to make a ""device"" storage tray area. I would have give a 5 star rating except for the excessive force which had to be used to install, and the flimsy front cover that simply refuses to stay on. Outside of those issues, the tray works fine and serves it purpose."
3,Cheap replacment,Nothing special about it. Just a Metra CD Pocket delete. Doesnt have the factory suede in it. Sucks but now my phone will slide around in it.
5,Good and easy,"Works great. Install was pretty easy. If you installed an aftermarket deck, it is so much better having a little cubby than having a useless CD Player. I just put electrical tape over the two little holes in the back so that nothing slips through. The holes are maybe the size of a pencil eraser, nothing crazy."
1,Don't waste your time,Installed in 2000 silverado in place of factory cassette player. This pocket is flimsy and is not OEM. I would not recommend. Leaves small gap at front and makes CD door hard to open. I will be taking this out once my OEM slot shows up!
5,Love it! Just as good as Starbucks!,"I have owned my Froth Au Lait for over 3 years. It still works perfectly and makes Lattes and Cappucinos just as good as the ones you can get at Starbucks! I have not regretted my purchase for one moment. At one point, I had thought that the united stopped working. I called customer service and spoke to the co-owner and she told me that there is a certain way the paddles had to be clicked into place. During cleaning I must not have put it back properly, but once I did, it worked just as wonderfully as before!"
4,awesome froth,"As a coffee house/cafe owner I depend on my equipment to be efficient and reliable and I have certainly found this with the Froth au Lait S10Froth Au Lait Professional S10 It makes fantastic steamed froth in less than a minute with just a touch of a button, leaving me hands free to complete other tasks. The stainless steel pitcher is commercial grade and cleans up easily. I would highly recommend it for any busy shop.Sarah K./Jitters"
2,Cheap plastic parts in high stress areas of frame,"I've had the Sunrider for a couple of weeks, spent about 5 hours today trying to install it, tonight the jeep is covered with a blue tarp because they are predicting thunderstorms. Will probably be removing it and putting the hard top back on tomorrow while waiting for Bestop to get back to me about all the broken parts.For the life of me, I cannot figure out why they would use cheap plastic parts in high stress joints of the frame for this top. Two of these ""knuckles"" as they call them were broken out of the box, and three more broke while trying to stretch the top over the frame, per the instructions. The instructions on the website and that come with the top make the install sound easy - DON'T BELIEVE IT! I have assembled computers from kits, built buildings from kits, rebuilt a bicycle following a manual. None of these were as frustrating as this top has been.Just wanted to warn anyone else out there."
1,Don't waste your money,"Even if the electronic ball return had been included with this product (as described), I still would have returned the item. The mat was very lightweight with many folds in it so it wasn't really suitable for the intended purpose."
4,Non-biased view points of both sides of the border,"The author has done a good job in presenting the facts and history leading up to the American intervention into Mexican affairs during the early part of this (20th) century. This book details the American air of superiority as well as Pancho Villa's reason's for raiding Columbus, NM. This is a great book for anyone interested in that period of Mexican-American history"
5,Pancho and Pershing,"Tough as nails history that tells of Mexico during the years of revolution and civil war. Pancho Villa and John ""Blackjack"" Pershing's punitive expedition is the focal point of the book. The author explains that bungling interventions in Mexico by American politicians didn't alter the fact that Mexicans ultimately determined their own governement. The book is a good introduction to a subject that may be obscure to many American readers, especially 85 years later. Eisenhower does well fleshing out details in the text, in several appendices, and thorough notations. Only a fellow named ""Eisenhower"" can give one this powerful insider perspective of military and political history. Recommended for multiple reading and further study. ;-)"
2,No Depth,"This narrative history fits the ""gee whiz"" version of events. Derived from English language secondary sources, it fails to explain the deeper motives of the U.S. in Mexico. Those included an arms build up in Veracruz in order to secure the defeat of the Villistas and Zapatistas."
3,Leave your brain at the door,"I quite enjoyed this, it's a lot of fun. Brainless, sexy fun.Yes, there are a lot of panties here, some would say far too many, but it's not really that obtrusive at all.The character designs are attractive, particularly the villains. I have to say I didn't go much on Aika herself, but that's only a small thing.There's plenty of violence and what surprises me is that no one, bar two very nasty villains, dies.It's probably more suited to males, but if you can see past all of the panties it's a lot of fun and a great way to spend a brainless, rainy day."
2,More mechs and uninspired,"This Tech readout is more of the same churned out of the FASA factory. More mechs than you can shake a stick at, and hopefully they get you to buy the overpriced minitatures. However, that being said, there are a lot of mechs here, enough for even the most ruthless player. Thankfully though they left out the ""Typhoon"", and ""Gauzzilla"" mechs. Mechforce North America rubber stamped pieces of junk that get away totally from the spirit of the game. Good background information on the mechs however, and good illustrations. How does Duane Loose do it?"
4,A Compelling Puzzle,As usual McGown tells one heck of a story.The puzzle the author sets for the reader has is very compelling and the characters personalities leap right off the page.An excellent read.
3,Unlucky Strike,"Having read and enjoyed some of the previous novels by Jill McGown about Lloyd and Hill, I was looking forward to this one. While I enjoyed it and will continue to read more in the series, I found myself disappointed in the ending. The motive for the killings was convoluted and just didn't hold water. I also had to keep reminding myself of who the characters were because they all had such normal names: Jack, Michael, Stephen, Tony, Tom, Ben. Good, stolid names. Good stolid writing. As I think about it, I realize that this is my criticism of the book; it is good, stolid writing, but there is no flair to it. Her characters are like paper dolls, with nothing substantial to keep them standing."
3,Too convoluted and slow,"The main characters are interesting and engaging, but their investigative skills leave a lot to be desired. So much of this mystery should have been figured out much earlier. It is very slow moving and barely kept my interest."
5,The best bat case,This case is great. Steiner quality is always the best. Be careful though it is very fragile. If you wear colorox plastic cleaning gloves you can put it together without fingerprints.
1,deadly dull,"Imagine having the opportunity to spend three months in Florence all expenses paid with no responsibilities! Heaven! But no, for Merrill Joan Gerber, it's about as welcome as an invitation to North Dakota in the winter. Her husband finally convinces her to come along. What we are treated to next is about as interesting, maybe less so, as any travel journal that the average tourist would keep. Today we went to xyz museum. The weather was cloudy/sunny etc.What on earth induced Gerber or her publisher to think that what she had to say was of any interest is beyond me."
1,The Whining American,"I'm sorry. I tried, but by the 7th chapter, I got so tired of the whining that I quit. Not only does she need to get out of her comfortable little life more often, but she needs to be more appreciative of the opportunities given to her."
2,Keep looking....,"A pretty pedestrian memoir by a woman who seems like she would be a very annoying travel companion. She's tired, she's hungry, she's unhappy, she's stressed. There must be better books about traveling to Florence than this."
5,Life is a Pleasure,"Merrill Joan Gerber's book about Florence is less about Florence than it is about life itself -- and because it is about life, it sheds light all over Florence itself. Here is an honest woman experiencing a foreign country, missing her home and mother, and recording with candor what she sees, feels, and hears. Instead of glorifying another culture, we are invited to see her heart -- and her love for her husband. A welcome read for those who travel for reasons other than Wanderlust."
1,Worthless,We bought these for our kids and neither of us were impressed. A complete waste of money and we would not buy again.
1,Thin Material,This is made of paper thin material that wripped apart within two weeks of us having it.
5,Top rate book w/good advice,"The title of this book is not the only thing that is covered (i.e. Dreamweaver MX). The authors also discuss HTML, standards, best practices, Mac vs. Windows browsers, etc, while introducing the features of Dreamweaver. This is important as many books just provide a point-and-click cookbook w/little relevant dicsussion as to ""why"" something is done a certain way.There are also useful references to resources on the internet and good tips. The writing style is easy to follow and there are many good illustrations. This is not only a fantastic book for Dreamweaver MX, but a great web development book as well.I buy a ton of tech books every year and don't give top reviews easily. This book definitely earns its 5 *'s."
1,Way to Expensive,"I'd love to buy a copy of this, but this is way to expensive to justify. Just watch eBay. Every so often a reasonably priced copy is for sale. I got mine for 30."
1,poor quality,"This was a graduation gift for my daughter. My daughter loved this show and I wanted to surprise her because we had lost a cassette tape we had years ago. For the price of this, you would think it would have been usable. However the tape is broken, and I will either have to try to get it repaired or go through the hassle of returning it. Oh well, that is the chance you take."
2,Stereotypes and Generalizations,"I thought this would be a more thoughtful, though playful, exploration of cultural difference. Instead, it plays upon stereotypes and generalizations for a quick laugh. If I'd bought it used at a thrift book store for $3, it would have been worth the 30 minutes of amusement it provides. Having bought it new, it wasn't really a good value. I haven't glanced at it again after the first read."
5,Erma Bombeck Meets Scarlett O'Hara,"The insider's 'Let's Go-South' guide book. Ms. Duffin-Ward lays bare the norms and traditions of Southern culture with a high-spirited Yankee aplomb!A funny read and an insightful reference, 'Suddenly Southern' is the perfect gift for those relocating to, or simply visiting the Southern region."
3,the book,I do not have much to say about this book I sold it after I left the school that forced me to buy it . It is a text book It does not really matter what I think . Work hard in Your English class Do the homework . Enjoy being in college .
2,Not recomended,"Hi,I have to say that this set is not even close to what I was expected from CMT.CMT have fairly priced and to our standard even high priced tools, so it is very disappointing when you get the very low quality tools. Extremely dull right out of the box, way off precise sharpened, and even when properly sharpened they quickly become dull again.Low quality steel, I have seen only on very cheap woodworking tools from eastern Europe (former Russia). Not recommending.Thanks for reading this review, best regards,Gingko."
4,Samurai Shodown Colt Game you can't escape from!!!,"Ever since company SNK has diminished, These games like Samurai Shodown has become the most valuable collectible of all time. Although most gamers who like fighting games, dislike the Samurai Shodown series, they are really missing out! Samurai Shodown started it all right after STREET FIGHTER. I have never seen anything so ""Awesome"" and spectacular graphics come to play on all Video Game systems. I wished that SNK stayed with Playstaion that way fans like myself could have collected them all instead of jumping to one system to another just to get all the Samurai Shodown series. Samurai Shodown has plenty of cool moves, improved levels of play, and great story lines for each character. Although it may seem quite easy, it still leaves you satisfied that you could slice someone up with a sharp sword and spend the rest of your day feeling Great! ITS A MUST BUY! Once you purchase it keep it under your bed. Someday this game will be worth a lot of money."
4,Good but Slow,"I liked Samurai Shodown 3, but it was a bit slow. Loading and in the action. The movements are cool, some neat fighting styles, but it can get annoying when you are playing and it does a kind of ""Matrix"" slow mo in the middle of the action. I think the graphics could have been clearer too, but SS has always been a bit grainy for systems. But, I still liked it!"
1,Stylish but poor quality,"I purchased this combination microwave and toaster oven for my office with high expectations two years ago. During this time, it worked extremely well, and had I written a review even two months ago, it would have been a five star review. About a month ago the control panel's buttons began to be difficult to operate. Now, the only buttons that operate are the one-minute express button (Ex on), the popcorn button, and the clock button. The toaster still works great. As many microwave oven reviewers have lamented recently, older high-end microwaves routinely lasted many years and now they don't. Having this one last only 2 years (with light use) is a great disappointment and I am now looking for both a new microwave and a toaster (given that we all have grown used to toasting our bagels!). Needless to say, I don't recommend this microwave unless you want to keep up with the latest appliances every year or so."
4,"So far, so good","Contemporary, sharp design fits well with the other stainless steel kitchen items. Small size is a plus in our cottage size home. Toaster has slide out drawer for easy clean up. Microwave is easy to use...not necessary to pull out directions. Pops popcorn 'much' better than our previous model. General clean up is also easy. [review based on 6 month use]"
1,What a P.O.C!!!!,"This Microwave is the biggest piece of crap...not only a month of having it did I have to take it in for repair, but now the glass plate exploded inside of it, when I went to wipe it down ALLL THE LETTERS WIPED OFF...Don't waste your money on this microwave!!!"
2,Do not recommend,"We've had our LG for about 2+ years. While the concept is great - I love the look and not pestering kids to put the toaster away, I would not buy this product again. The microwave works fine. It is easy to use and as a stand alone, I would give it 4-stars. The toaster is the problem. I would give it a 1-star. It does not toast evenly, but that is assuming you can get the toaster to work. The door to the toaster does not shut properly and frequently does not start. When you do get it to start toasting, the door will lose the connection required to run and will stop before the toasting time is up. I've tried taping the door shut and that worked for a little while, but doesn't any more. The other day I spent a good 5 minutes just trying to get the toaster to start. The kids have started toasting their bread in the skillet! I'm ready to go back to two units. It is just not worth the frustration!"
2,It drives us nuts......,"We bought this LG Stainless Steel Toaster for our office, and the nightmare has started ever since. We've had them (we bought 2)for about half a year now, there are still people, including myself sometimes, standing in front of the mechanism hopelessly and trying to figure out what they are looking at and how they should use it. There is no primary visual clues that guide you through the using process ( all the buttons look exactly the same). The captions under those buttons as equally confusing. In short, you can only force yourself to get used to it, let alone taking pleasure of using the product. Personally, it doesn't matter how good it performs, because all the aggravations you get from the user interface are enough to kill a good brand like LG. My advice - think twice on this item."
1,Worst Microwave Ever.,"I purchased this microwave here on Amazon, and it arrived about two weeks later. It doesn't work at all. It just doesn't heat up the food. 3 calls to lg customer services got me nowhere, they refused to help me get it repaired. Please stay away from such a shoddy product."
5,compeletly satisfied,"The book was in excellent condition. It arrived so quick that I could not believe it. Will absolutely use the used book section again and reccommend it to family and friends. The ""Dummies"" books are a good investment for self learners"
2,Disappointing,"I've used books in the MS Office At a Glance series, and expected this to be comparable. This book jumps around a lot, is disorganized, and lacks sufficient illustrations. If you are someone who learns better by being shown how to do something than you do reading instructions, you would be better off using the Office At a Glance books."
3,disapointed,the whole book was people talking. Nothing really happend. I also dislike how Ashe is never there when everything goes wrong with Rhapsody. I also do not understand what the point of Anwyn was. She was like a page filler.
2,Series is wearing thin,"Once again, a fantasy writer has become so enamored with her own characters or prose or whatever that she or he does not know when to wrap things up.Don't publishers employ editors any longer?How many times can the same word, phrase or plot device be used?I'll finish reading the series but I won't be happy about it."
4,This series might have a future . . .,"I really like Haydon's prose, but sometimes get annoyed with the angst, insecurity, and whining of many of the characters. That being set I have stuck with the series for two or three characters that I love and cannot wait to read about. However, Elegy For A Lost Star reminded me of why I liked the original book in this series. I'm sure Haydon has some more great story in her and maybe one day they'll actually save the world."
3,Lacks Previous Intensity,"I am a huge fan of Elizabeth Haydon books, but I must admit that Elegy for a Lost Star seemed to fall short of expectations set by Haydon's previous novels. While the book surely sets up a working stage for novels to come, I wish that Achmed and Grunthor had actually played larger roles and that Raphsody hadn't been so...so blah this time around. I did not care for the changes her character endured. I agree with another reviewer who said he would like to see more emotion. At times I found myself wishing that Raphsody and Ashe would actually show EMOTION; some of the dialogue was stiff and didn't sound like the characters would really talk in the way they were made to. I don't know; over all, the book wasn't horrible, but I personally was hoping for much more."
3,Getting more back in the swing!,"Just a comment to P. Pollak: Definetly, definetly read the first books. And then you'd know immediately to what that 'Elegy for a Lost Star' is referenced. You'll understand SO much more. And the first three books are much, much more enjoyable.This book was better than it's predecessor in the series. Haydon seems to get a slightly better grip on her character's personalities. It's definetly a book that's just moving you along in action until the next volume is available. Still interesting and with some surprising twists and turns. The child is born (though a few lines in that section were REALLY drama-queeny and plain annoying for a RPGer like me) and, horror of horrors, Anwyn is back. And MAD.Again, how I lament Faron, the maligned! *poses dramatically* I am eager to see what happens to the poor... uh.. fish-living-stone-man-thing."
3,War in a box!,"My title for this game is War in a box. becausw in this game it is WW3 and you have to command tanks, choppers, CAS, Artillery and more... Sure there are some problems as one of the editorial reviews mentioned but I noticed that it didn't effect the game play that much.All in all if you want a good game... you can't go wrong."
5,PERFECT CONDITION!!!,The CD came to me in perfect condition and was a great surprise as it arrived earlier than I had expected!
2,sun glasses,they work when you keep them down but if they are flip up and you hit it down to block the sun they fall apart
1,bad glasses,these glasses were very poor. i was excited to get some flip glasses but they basically come broken. the whole frame comes off everytime you try and flip them or change glasses or even run for heavens sake. these glasses suck. i'm pissed i have to send them back in
3,Look Cool but the Flips Flop!,"My 9 yr old loves his new baseball sunglasses with interchangeable lenses; he looks cool and can field those fly balls with greater ease. We both are frustrated by two things, however:1. The lenses pop in easily, but that ensures that flop out easily. They just don't stay in the frame as well as they should for active wear.2. That problem creates another: a case is not provided (for which we would have gladly paid extra), so storage is difficult, and the lens pops out when we try to put it in a bag we're using until we can find a case large enough to accomodate the sunglasses and all the lenses.If the manufacturer would tweak the design a bit and include a case, we would have paid up to $[...] for these otherwise useful and attractive sunglasses."
1,came apart every time,"Flip up, flip down, lens part comes off. Every time. I tried a little bit of olive oil with no improvement. It doesn't look like the floral wire mod discussed above would work in my case because of how the two pieces come apart. It looks like even with that mod they would come halfway apart and then be jammed. I'm not willing to render them non-returnable with a drill to find out."
2,Gumball machine prize.,cheap construction compared to other products by same manufacturer and flip up feature does not work well. Severe curve to frame insures that flip up will be interfered with by bill cap (aren't baseball glasses normally worn with baseball hats?)
1,MUST READ!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS PRODUCT IS SOOOOOOO BAD, I PLAY MEN'S COMPETITIVE SOFTBALL 9 MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR, PLEASE TAKE IT FROM ME IT'S A WASTE OF TIME TO BUY THESE GLASSES. AMOZON IS GOING TO REFUND MY MONEY SO IT'S NOT A MONEY THING, IT'S A WASTE OF TIME BECAUSE YOU WILL SEND IT BACK!!!!!!! THE WORST BUY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!I HAD NO CHOICE TO RATE A 1-STAR, BUT THESE GLASSES DESERVE NO STARS."
1,all clad fall short on the double boiler concept for cheese fondue,"The use of the double boiler concept for cheese fondue is a miserable failure. I tried melting the cheeses on a regular stove and it took forever (30+ minutes???) and still it has not fully melted. I finally gave up. The reason for allclad to use a NON stove top safe ceramic inset is beyond me. Why don't they just use a stove top safe ceramic pot, just like what they do in Switzerland?"
3,Good idea but not for all chains.,"I am always looking for an easier way to sharpen my chain saw because I do it after every hour of use. In my opinion the sharper the better and the longer the motor will last. Needless to say, with that attitude, faster sharpening is better and this looked like an interesting approach to the problem. Unfortunately the way it is setup does not match the geometry of my Husqvarna chains specifically the hook of the teeth. It may work with other types or brands but there there is no way as there are no specs on the product."
2,Disappointed,"Only lasted six months, the bulbs are not really even white let alone blue. I would not purchase again, nor would I recommend them to a friend."
2,Only 6 months!,"Got these in December 2010 for my Nissan Cefiro (= Maxima). I live in the tropics, so no daytime running lights, so I guess that's why they lasted twice as long as others have reviewed. They were great at first, it was like having your personal sun at night, but 6 months is unacceptable. They just died on me one night driving home with my kids.... both of them. I had to resort to brights. That was also unacceptable."
2,Xenon blue my a$$,I installed these last night and they look almost the exact same as my stock bulbs. If anything its only slightly brighter but very slight difference than stock. I plan on getting HID 6000k bulbs for a white look. i should have pics of the hella bulbs installed soon
2,BURNED IN ONLY 3 MONTHS OF USE,"I bought a kit from Hella bulbs (HELLA H83145112 H7 12V/55W High Performance Xenon Blue Halogen Bulb Set). The bulbs do not have the super white effect as they say, is between yellow and white. One of the bulbs burned out in only 3 months of use. I am very disappointed with the low quality. Only 2 stars for HELLA. I do not recommend."
2,Definitely NOT Blue,"The item is called Xenon Blue Halogen Bulb Set. When I installed it there's not even a hue of blue in the light nor does it give off crisp white light. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because they work - for now. Read the reviews of poor lasting, really don't care at this point as I was hoping for blue lighting. Ideally, the seller should exchange these for a ""real"" blue bulb but what are the chances???"
4,Nice and bright,"This bulb lasts as long as most replacement bulbs on a 1200GS. Until I upgrade the bike to HID, I cut the two pack in half and always have a spare."
5,A review to praise a book to encourage others to read aloud,My 4 year old daughter loves this book and so do I. This is a nested story where each progressive element builds as the fox attempts to get his tail back from an old lady through bartering. The repetition allows a child to participate in the story. I like to pause to let my daughter fill in what each character needs in order to help the fox. The illustrations are vibrant and fun. Highly recommended for bedtime stories.
3,"We prefer ""The Scarecrow's Hat"" by Ken Brown","This book is FUN to read out loud, very fast. Very fast.Simple and cute illustrations get the job done. The story line starts with a theft, then proceeds to a dismemberment, and relies on pleading and - finally - charity to resolve the problem.We very much prefer a similar story called ""The Scarecrow's Hat"" by Ken Brown -- get what you want without whining or complaining."
2,"Castration Complex, Anyone?","I remember this book from childhood, and I also recall being disturbed by the mutilation motif.Looking at it in hindsight, this book sends a somewhat disturbing Freudian message that amounts to, ""If you aren't good, you'll be castrated"" - I.E. Have your individuality/power/self taken away, as symbolised by the foxes tail (What else do you think of when you think of a fox? It's what makes him ""foxlike"" - his ""self"").Corporal punishment, thinly-veiled castration motifs, and work-with-the-group-or-lose-your-identity message make this a no-go for any child of mine, Caldecott or no. Either that or I'll name my kid Little Hans (gittit, Freud fans?)..."
4,Excellent value for smooth skin.,"I noticed a change in my skin the first time I used this little machine. It does a great job of cleaning and exfoliating. I suppose you could buy a more expensive, bigger name item, but I wouldn't bother. You can get exactly what you need from this machine without spending a fortune."
4,Best Ever!!,"The kit was amazing. Although the candle, cd, and mask were a little fruitsy, everything else was perfect. The brush made my skin look better in days. I felt like I had just spent an hour getting a professional facial!! I recommend this and hope you'll love it too."
2,Cheaper than best buy. Belts aren't that great.,"This was a genuine Eureka belt, but in my opinion they are thin and crappy. Product design by Eureka though. Bought one of the heavy duty belts at one point too, but the first time you catch something it snaps off instantly. I guess its probably good they make such a cheap easy to replace part the breaking point. Just makes me mad, because it seems like I'm always replacing it. Maybe its just me..."
2,Burned out too quick,"I purchased this a little over 4 months ago and it already is broken. Not sure what the problem was, but I won't be buying this one again."
1,bad belt,"The belt I received started to unravel the first time I used it, I had to cut the loose threads off of it in order to make it work and it is still making a squeaking noise. I will have to replace it with another after only a couple more uses. Belts I have purchased it the past have lasted for at least a year and I will not buy from this supplier again, I believe it was defective from the start."
1,Belt broke during my very first use.,"Not much to say beside it broke during my first use. Please be aware the picture you see is not the product you will get, guaranteed. Try eureka's website and you will find the real one which costs ~$11."
5,great product,"I received this product very fast and it works perfect it had a very good price, and save me the trip to a store. I really recomend to buy from this web site."
4,Works fine now!,Cheap and easy fix instead of buying a new vaccuum. Fast and easy and done. Now it's back to working order.
1,Generic Junk,"Even though the belt is described as Eureka, the item came in just the plastic bag it was shipped in. It did not match what the seller has a picture of, so I took it as being a generic, and not what I believed I was buying. Guess what happened after TWO USES . . . it broke. I was left without a vacuum for over two weeks until I purchased and received Eureka brand belts from another Amazon seller for the same price. Guess what happened when using the real Eureka brand belt . . . it worked perfect! Don't buy this belt, look around for the real thing."
2,always breaking,"These vacuum belts seem to always break if I roll over an electric cord, clothing, etc. They need to be made tougher so they can endure more stress without brittle failure."
1,Breaks on Third Use,Terrible product. Installed correctly and the belt tore after the third use. Belt almost felt like it was made out of cheap plastic. Save your money and buy the real deal.
3,Is this the right belt?,"I'm hoping this is a true 3 star rating, and not less. I received the belt in an envelope, there was no packaging for the belt itself, so there is no way of knowing if it's the right size. Also there is no way of knowing if it's truly a ""Eureka"" belt as shown in the picture or if it's a generic version. My guess is generic. I would think it would have had a plastic bag on it marking what it was... or at least some markings on the belt itself. I have an older vacuum and was ordering other parts (bags, filters, etc), so I also ordered a ""just in case"" belt. I guess I will just have to wait and see if this one will work if/when the belt actually breaks."
2,The belt broke AGAIN!!,"Right after the belt breaking might not be a good time to rate this..., or maybe it is.At the rate we are going through belts on this machine, I'm not inclined to buy this vacuum again when we need to replace it. Granted - the vacuum is getting old and beat up. Perhaps it is something wrong there. The height adjustment doesn't seem to work right. It adjusts some, but not significantly. Maybe that is the problem.Whatever it is, is frustrating! The belts cost too much and last too little. If they don't break, they stretch. Either way, with a broken or stretched belt, the vacuum doesn't work."
5,Eureka belt,Eureka R Style belt is exactly what I ordered and it is the right size for my vaccum. It now works perfectly..
2,Not advertised product,"I haven't even used it yet, but it is not what the picture says it is. It better work right."
3,Surprised how easy it is to break a belt,"I use my vacuum most commonly on a room that has indoor/outdoor carpet. So the height adjustment is one or two notches away from bare floor. With this adjustment the very first time I used the vacuum I broke a belt!!! I believe it resulted from putting the vacuum back in the upright locked position while the vacuum was still on and the brush was still spinning. Doing this seems to put a great amount of stress on the brush spinning process. Therefore causing the belt to snap!I would suggest ALWAYS turning the vacuum off before putting it in the upright locked position. Just in case I forget, I bought two more belts!"
1,Something not right with this belt,Used on Model 4870. Original belt lasted 3 years and worked great. On first use this belt purchased through Amazon would not rotate the brush properly. I took apart and checked everything and everything else was fine. The belt just did not work properly. Adjusted height of vacuum to highest setting and that helped a little but after about five uses the belt just completely failed. Either Eureka has completely faulty quality control or these weren't genuine Eureka belts. Something was obviously not right. Waste of money.
1,Belt broke after the first use,"The original belt lasted for seven years. The picture for the belt shows it is a ""genuie"" Eureka ""extended"" life belt. What a joke, the belt broke after the first use. Totally waste my time and money."
1,Broke after two months,"I bought this belt about two months ago and installed it with no problem. It worked fine for about two months and then snapped. Don't waste your money. And as a note to the first reviewers info about adjusting the height properly for my carpet, I do, so that was not the issue. This belt was useless. I am now in search of another replacement!"
4,Eureka R Style Vacuum Belt,"Great price, FAST shipping, however I expected an ""Extended life"" belt as the ad shows, but received just a normal ""R"" belt. Belt works fine and installed in just a few minutes. Seller needs to change their photo so people are not misled.UPDATE 03/17/2012 Still going.........."
1,Useless,This belt lasted less than 10 minutes and broke. It is paper thin. I got the real belt from Eureka and have had no problems
2,Just a Belt,Life of the Belts are not very long... The Vacuum is now Deadlined Per my Step Daughterso she wont be needing anymore because She has an Electrolux
4,Just like the original,This belt fit just like it is supposed to and after numerous uses of the vacuum cleaner I haven't had any problems with it breaking or getting loose.
2,broke to soon,Bought this belt in june and it broke in september...the previous belt I replaced lasted for over 5 years....what is wrong with the products of today...going to try another one and hope this one will last longer...I feel as though the manufacturer does this in order to keep their revenue up...times are hard enough...
2,Didn't last long,"This belt only lasted until the second use of the vacuum cleaner before it frayed & came off. BUT... to be fair, the Vac Cleaner Repairman/Salesman told us that model vacuum cleaner tends to run hot if an expensive filter is not replaced every so often, and the heat from the motor ruins the belts. At this point the damage is done, and you buy a new vac (from him) or re-build the vac as you replace the motor. Didn't want to spend another $5 for a another belt that would not last. Shopping for new vac."
2,"All reviews considered, a useful life of 3 minutes is still brief","The belt that came with the vacuum was tough and worked > 1y till a week or so ago. I replaced it a few minutes ago with this product, using two on-line versions of directions plus common sense, and I didn't even cross the room before it broke again.Two floors, three vacuums, all Eurekas. If only the belts were as strong as an O-ring...."
1,Not what I expected,"I really wanted to return the Eureka vacuum but did not receive any communication from Amazon regarding this problem. The vacuum I ordered and purchased is much too heavy for me. I also thought this vacuum had a power control brush and I find it nearly impossible to push the vacuum. I'm a Senior with very little muscle strength in my arms I cannot push the vacuum. Therefore, the vacuum sits in my closet and I'm very disappointed. I wish I could exchange this vacuum for one that is lighter and much easier to handle. Is it possible for someone from Amazon to contact me?"
3,OK Belt-Bad Design,"Bad Design for a vaccum cleaner belt. Belt should be much thicker. Breaks easily,does not wear out."
3,Open package,"I ordered 9 bags, but it came in a 10 pack bag where somebody just opened it and pulled out one bag to give me my 9. I thought that wasn't too professional. Not only that, I also ordered a belt. It didn't even come in it's own packaging. It was just thrown in the post office packaging with the open 10 pack bag and shipped.I got what I ordered, but I would think the seller would want to be a little more professional."
4,It works for me,I bought my second Eureka from Amazon. I used the recommended products and those last a long time. The belt is easy to install. During normal wear and tear the belt can last for several months.
1,Poor little belt,Eureka made this belt intentionally flimsy it seems. It slips on the pulley and the brush doesn't turn on the carpet
2,Just buy directly from Eureka,"The original belt that came with my 4870 lasted 2.5 years. Once it snapped I bought this one and it lasted 2 months. I just ordered one from Eureka.com so we'll see how that one goes. Note, the one on Eureka.com is labeled as a 61110C, whereas this one is 61110B. Not sure what the difference is, but I'm assuming the one from Eureka.com (which is similar in price) will last longer."
3,Not for young children learning the alphabet,"Mr. Palotta has written a beautiful book. However, it is truly not for young children just learning the alphabet, and would be better appreciated by 8+ year-olds. Also note that contrary to the title, military aircraft are featured. This is not a book that explains the parts of the airplane or instruments. A good choice for one with an interest in military aviation, whose parent knows military planes very well. Not for an airline pilot's kid."
2,Poor quality,The content of the book is good and my 2-year-old son enjoyed the book a lot. Unfortunately the paper is of low strength and is not up to the hard use that young users can dish out.
5,Leg cramps anyone?,"This massager is very heavy and extremely strong. For general massage, loosening taut muscles and relaxation, I don't recommend it. However...I get leg cramps. Excruciatingly painful, middle-of-the-night, leap-out-of-bed and bite-the-bullet-so-as-not-to-wake-up-the-neighbors leg cramps.I keep this plugged in and handy and apply it immediately, full-force, on the cramping muscle. It still may take a while for the cramping to subside, but this is the only thing I've found the makes any difference while in the throes.I've *dramatically* reduced the frequency of leg cramps by doing simple mild stretching, but when one hits, this is a god-send. The rest of the night's sleep is usually salvageable, for which I'm grateful."
4,Best way to get your tension out.,It does get the tension and stress out of your muscles. Worth just to try it.
2,Don't purchase unless,"Unless you have the physique of an NBA player find another make of massager. This one is too heavy, hard or impossible to hold, and very awkward to use. If used by one person on another it might be usable. On the positive side it does give you a good massage."
5,Ergonomic Design,"The Palm Percussion Personal Massage is perfect for massaging away daily tension with or without heat. The 3 custom massage attachments allow three forms of massage.Pinpoint Massage - Works everywhere but on the head, the 2,200 pulses per minute are fine on the shoulders and lower neck.Heated Massage - The heat is especially comforting on your feet and shoulders.Contoured Massage - great for legsWhile holding this unit, it is easy to control the speed with one fingertip and the adjustable strap makes holding the unit especially easy when giving or receiving a massage.Perfect for deep tissue massage that is therapeutic and comforting. The ergonomic design makes this a favorite and the speed control dial makes it easy to change the intensity level. Perfect to take with you when traveling because it is so compact and also great to use while watching movies or after exercising.~The Rebecca Review"
3,Works for pain relief - doesn't stand up to use,"We buy these for pain relief for my husbands hip. He says they work great, but they don't hold up very well so I buy 5 to six a year. Wish they were sturdier or cheaper but if it works it works."
5,Not just an ordinary underwater documentary,"The scenes of this video are incredible! Using the latest rebreathing technology, divers were able to stay continuously underwater for long periods, somtimes up to six hours to capture a single event. A lot of the footages were rare and never seen before on television.I particularly liked ""The Making Of"" part, where they actually showed how the cameras were being set up and the divers were just waiting for the sea creatures to perform.I am a divemaster myself and it is the best underwater documentary I have seen. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this video."
1,Don't try this net. Ripped in 5 minutes,"Not sure how the people that like this net are doing it, but mine ripped on about the 10th shot I hit. Went straight through. I got lucky that it hit a tree in my own yard, and didn't cause damage or even hurt somebody. I'll be returning it to the retail store I bought it at, and spending the extra money for a higher quality net. For what it's worth, it was not a very easy setup for 2 people, although with practice it would have gotten easier."
3,Not exactly as described.,"okay. This item is good. But don't expect it to work on concrete or anywhere. You will need to screw it down into the ground like a tent. So, it only works in backyards. Also, it falls down if a fastball is thrown. Not the best item for the money. I'd rather recommend tarpaulin tied with a string."
1,"Hit 10 shots with driver, now 2 holes in it","IF you hit the middle wilson sign, I guess it will be okay.My first driver shot which I pushed a bit and hit the side of the wilson sign, ripped the net and made a hole. After about 20 shots, I missed 4 shots off the middle target and now I have two holes.If you can hit more than 230 yards with your driver but miss the middle target, there are high possibility that you will make a lot of holes in the net like me...Disappointed. Set up took me about 7 minutes at first."
4,wilson golf Multi Sport Cage Net,"The net is just fine, but insert does not have a ""W"" in the center.The insert has ""WILSON"" and does not give me a true bulls eye."
2,Not a great item,"Had no trouble setting up, but balls go easily through the netting and quality is lacking. Netting tears easily. Bought for a christmas present and just started using it as the weather has cleared up. Second time out, balls go completely through the net. Stiching for the support poles has started to unravel. Less than quality product. Don't wast your money on this..."
1,Net rips! Difficult to set up!,Difficult to set up!Netting rips far too easily...Avoid this item!Be sure to look for something that has hassle free set up and also water resistent nylon netting thats tough!
2,Sports net,"Unfortunately, this product did not live up to our expectations. It did not last one full season. The bottom braces not reinforced very well."
2,Balls will rip through it,"1. Impact on the tarp is very loud -- especially in an enclosed garage.2. I missed the tarp slightly and the ball ripped through, puttting a hole in my garage wall."
2,Do Not Leave Outside,"Was extremely disappointed with the net. Was especially difficult to set up by myself, expensive, and because I was looking for convenience I left it standing once I got it secured. Literally rotted after about a week. Sad lesson learned. Looks like they went with the cheapest materials available. At least they got a little profit out of me before I cut them loose forever. Nice job, Wilson."
5,What I like...,"This is exactly the type of movie I find interesting... underground, possibly under-budget, but real. Most mainstream movies are terrible now, and if you look to the independent movies like this, you will find something many movies lack. It goes deep, maybe, without meaning to... and it has a storyline that has been done with the drug thing, but the whole Klepto counter-part makes it really fresh with the concept and inner-ties... I must admit I only downloaded this for Meredith Bishop (Annie Mack) and yes this is the hottest I have ever seen her even with the toga commercials, but I bought it and will appreciate the real copy because the movie is fantastic!"
1,Awful film. Why does the tagline say it is a comedy?,"I have no idea why this movie has more than 2 stars. I found it to be dreadful. The acting was terrible and the story was worse. I kept waiting for it to get good, placing too much faith in the ratings of others, but it only got worse.The tag line states that this movie is a comedy, but there isn't a shred of humor in the entire film. I repeat, THIS IS __NOT__ A COMEDY. At the end of the film my only thought was regret that I'll never get those 90 minutes back."
4,An excellent example of a 3-d fighter,Rival Schools rivals almost any of the 3-d fighters out there. Aside from the mighty Tekken series this game is second to none. The team mode is an excellent and entertaining extra that adds a little originality to the sometimes unoriginal fighting genre. A great buy indeed.
5,Awesome,"I love this game so much. I bought it for a gift and played it when it was opened and boy, was it fun!"
4,Great board,"I bought this as my first longboard and love it. My only issue s with it was the small wheels that came on it, but these were quickly replaced and it improved the stability greatly. it also sits a little high, but its easy to get used to. Handles well and is easy to pump on."
5,You'll be satisfied,"This is an awesome board for fast transportation, stable downhill speeds, looks good for the ladies (or guys), and excellent handling. So it's a great bored.Don't hesitate to buy if your okay with the price.Only thing that might change your mind is if your comfortable at longboarding and are use to doing hard/sharp carving. This board gets a bit of wheelbite at first but that is just in the beginning."
4,longboard,"long board rides well but need wider wheels, when traveling fast and go to turn doesn't work well to tippy doesn't hold to ground good enough or need wider axles."
5,Very happy with this purchase,"My six year old boy got a board from Santa (a complete from Turf Global), and he wanted me to get a board so I could skate with him to and from school instead of walking, and I am glad I chose this board from Endless Summer legend Robert August's namesake company. I'm a newby, but I found this board super stable and easy to ride, plus it looks great. It is a big board as many others have mentioned, but I love it and I couldn't be happier with this purchase."
1,"dry, boring read","I'm currently reading this book for a graduate school class. I've read many books, some of which have been bad. This one has got to be the worst book I've ever read. I don't look forward to reading this. He lacks a central point. The book simply rambles on from one case example to another....don't waste your time with this it will drive you nuts.-1/2 a star"
1,Absolute waste of money...,"This book is nothing but superfluous stuff that you can easily find on your own. No real world specific examples. He uses his books to sell you his ""coaching services"" and nothing more. This guy is a BS artist....save your money. Do a search on Brad sugars books on Amazon; they all have ""5"" star ratings....hmmm, what a coincidence! IMO, the ratings are fake, and put there by his own people."
5,Great Educational Tool!,I have watched a Brad Sugars seminar on Dvd and read most of his books and I must say the guy will tell you exactly what you need to do to create a successful business.Billionaire in Training is his core book which will teach you the mindset you need to have in today's economy in order to stay ahead of the game.Brad is very nitty gritty and tells personal stories about his numerous different types of retail stores he owns and how he has made them successful.
3,King of the rocket men,Brings back fond memories of my sat afternoons at the movies. Forgot just how lame these were at the time but well worth the money if this guy was your hero at 8.
1,"Great serial, spoiled by poor transfer","Great serial, great transfer - well almost. Have tried 3 copies and Chapter 12 goes blank after 2 mins. It's a bit like having a good thriller with the last page torn out!Hiccup on chapter 2, one sequence repeats itselfShame, I was really looking forward to this."
1,quality horrible,"sorry to say that my copy was very good until the final chapter it went blank..nothing..just sooo ""p*s*d off""..sitting through the whole serial front to back, last chapter."" no picture"" as you can see i am totally disgusted, didnt even know how it ended.."
3,"it works, but with concerns","I tried the windscreen with my snowpeak stove in windy conditions and it does help keep the flame from blowing all around. However I also used it on a calm day to see if it would boil 3 cups of water faster with it on and what I found was the wind screen started glowing bright red. I felt the top of the fuel canister and it was hot to the touch, Im not sure how much heat a fuel canister can handle safely but it kinda freaked me out so I took it off and continued without it. What i suspect is the windscreen is kinda trapping heat between it and the cooking pot causing the screen to heat up and reflecting it back down onto the fuel canister.....So please use with caution!"
3,Instructions would be nice....,"Well, it comes with all the fun little things, but the unit itself comes with no instructions, so I wasn't too clear on WHAT you were supposed to use it for. Calluses? Foot in general? Toenails? Sandpapering toenail polish off? (That DOES work, by the way, tried it for all those purposes, but I don't know if that's what it's intended for).Whatever it's supposed to do, it does, I guess. I'm not very impressed, though."
1,good - if you dont use it,"I bought this combo for my brother-in-laws birthday. He now thinks I know nothing about electronics. When we played a dvd I was shocked--SHOCKED to see one of the worst dvd pictures I have ever seen. Sony is a leader in dvd players. Thier players are always recommended but, they must have threw this together at the last minute with thier two cheapest units cause both were bad. I really dont know what to say.. I just dont..."
2,its ok...,"I got this unit thinking that it would be great since it is a Sony. It was easy to hook up and at basic testing seems fine. The unit does have mp3 cd and jpg cd playback which is nice. I personally haven't had any dvd playback issues as others have but I have been disappointed with the quality. When hooked up to a 100 watt amplifier with the volume at less then 1/4 this unit even when off produces an noticeable annoying electronic whinny noise. I also found that it failed to do well in hi-fi recording. The unit would act oddly and many times record in the old style with the audio on the side of the tape, and in this case made a disgusting warping sound. I also am disappointed that this player does not have options for random or programmable playback. I wish I did not buy this and I had bought a single dvd player and used my old hi-fi vcr."
2,Sony Disappointment,"Sony is a name that I always thought I could count on, but this DVD/VHS combo has me afraid to buy another Sony product. It stops on every DVD it plays - brand new, used, slightly scratched, totally unscratched, whatever. It happens sometimes early on in the movie, more often an hour into it. When the player was still under warranty, I took it in to get fixed. I should have known it was not a good sign when I explained the problem and the guy said ""yeah, it happens all the time."" I waited a week; they said they replaced the ""DVD assembly"". Well it worked for about a month and then the same problem started again. The picture freezes for 20-30 seconds on every DVD. Too bad for Sony. The good reputation it built up has now been destroyed with one bad machine."
1,Me too...,The first unit I got would not play some DVDs and would freeze playing others. I replaced it and had the same ploblem. There is clearly a design flaw here.
1,Possible fix for DVDs?,"I dunno why I tried this, but one day I did, and it has worked every single time I have attempted to play a DVD; whereas before, it wouldn't -- despite numerous tries with the same disc.1) Press the button to open the tray.2) Place DVD disc upside down & press play.3) Wait a minute or two, until the ERROR sign pops up.4) Open the tray and this time place the disc right-side up.5) Press play and it should play shortly thereafter. You should be able to access the menu and make any changes to sound or language (I am able).I hope this works for you, as it does for me. It's annoying, but at least the player is operable. Please pass it on if it does, and if it doesn't, then don't! =)"
1,TOTALLY UNRELIABLE,"I bought the whole Sony system including the surround sound with this product. About 6 months after I bought it, the DVDs would occasionally fail to load. One would fail, and then the next 2 would work, and I just persisted on. When a DVD failed, it would not eject. It would take anywhere from 5 minutes to 8 hours to eject, turning the player on and off. Three out of four times I played a DVD, it NEVER failed to skip or freeze up. I've finally had it - I'm putting it in the Good Will box and getting something else. I was silly, silly for not returning the thing immediately, but I kept on having faith it would work itself out. NOT."
1,Buyer Beware,"I just returned this unit because of the same problems people had with the earlier SLV-D100. The first line on the addendum says ""DVD's with scratches may cause the disc to pause"". Not a good sign. Scratches or not the machine paused on every dvd I played. New, used, played once or twice it didn't matter. They all froze at some point in time during playback. I tried eight dvd's and had trouble with them all. I called Sony and of course they had nothing to offer. I wanted to keep this item but I had to return it, it was useless. I'm going to look at Panasonic next, hope they are better. I really used to admire Sony products. I have an older Trinitron TV and the picture is still amazing, nothing like it today. But today's Sony equipment is price competing junk."
1,Stay Away from this Unit!,Just bought mine at Wal-Mart as part of Sony's pre-packaged home theater system. I should have checked the reviews here firat. I tried 3 different DVDs and it stumbles on all of them -- pauses and pixellation. Very disappointing. Everything goes back tomorrow!
1,Disappointing unit,"As mentioned by other users, this unit experiences difficulty in playing DVDs. Not only does it pause on occasion, but the screen also gets pixelated in the process. Interestingly though, the unit does do a good job at playing back VCDs. The VCR unit also operates flawlessly."
1,do NOT buy this one!,"I used be (and still am) a Sony fan, but this one disappoints me.Like other reviewers already written, this player doesn't play DVD's properly. It pauses while playing DVD's, forcing me to push the stop and play buttons again. Note that this happens even with new DVD's.I won't recommend this one to anyone."
1,Sony is not what it used to be,I had the same problem as everyone else.About 40 minutes into playing a DVD (every DVD)- it would stop for about 20-30 seconds then continue.From reading the reviews - looks like this is NOT a unique problem!But when I called Sony about it - they said nothing about being familiar with this problem.I had to return the unit.The salesman told me that even though it is a Sony. It is made in Mexico with all the other DVD players...So what's in a name - nothing probably...
1,Horrible unit--please do not buy,"This player has stopped on about every other or every 3rd disc I try to play. some discs have a few scratches on, some have none.The remote has a terrible lay out, but this I could live with.The parental control setting (which I have never enabled) is constantly telling me that the movie violates the parental control settings--I have repeatedly tried to turn off parental control.The remote works for a few days and then stops working--even with fresh batteries. If you take the battery cover off, pull a battery out and put it right back the remote magically works again for a few days--a piece of junk.If I could vote less than 1 star for this, I would."
3,It has good and bad,"Around the same time, we had bought two DVD players, a Mintek ($40) and this Sony ($200.) I have to say I like the Mintek a lot more. This Sony Combo is very picky on what DVD's I put! The Mintek is able to play ALL data, most video, and even a PAL DVD from Italy. But the Sony, which costs way too much more, is not even able to play any of that. :(. Although, the reliablility level is very good. It really has never given us any technological problems. But I am saddened to see that Sony dosen't allow so many kinds of DVD's. Also, we have had experiences when this DVD would freeze in between parts of movies.It does play DATA MP3 CD. (Which thats a good feature.) The VHS player is very good and has not given any problems. I would reccomend this to someone who dosen't use data CD's with , AVI or any type of media file.Also its good for DVD's which are either WORLD or NTSC region. If you are someone who watches only DVD's and VHS, than this is for you. Thanks and God Bless."
4,Patrick Walker's comments,You are wrong Patrick Walker.For this price (about $179) you should NOT expect it to record onto DVD. Your acting like you've been tricked by the manufacturer/retailer when you simply haven't done your homework. I believe DVD recorders are $300+.I just bought the unit and I've been happy so far.
1,Don't buy this crappy product,I had a terrible experience with this product. There was a problem with the switch between vcr & DVD. I can't play tapes or record programs and spent too much time on the phone with customer service... I'm bringing it back to Circut City =(
2,VCR not adequate for watching pre-recorded TV programs,"Two features convinced me to buy this:1. Easy setup for recording tv programs -- which I was very satisfied with.2. Has commercial skip (which was described to me by the salesman that it would know, from the increased volume level of the commercials, to stop fast forwarding when the regular program started to playback.) However, it DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY. By hitting the SKIP button, the VCR skips the tape for 30 seconds on the counter each time button is pressed (up to 4 times). The problem is that the COMMERCIALS last WELL OVER 2 minutes.In addition, the FAST FORWARD has ONLY ONE SPEED -- you can't ""double click it go faster (like the other 4 VCR's I've had do.)I even called Sony customer service department and verified that it does not have two speeds.In a nutshell, if you like to prerecord your favorite TV shows and be able to WATCH THEM LATER and FASTER, this machine IS NOT FOR YOU."
4,Works Pretty Good,"Wow! Was I ever surprised that there are so many negative reviews of this unit. Of course, did I read the reviews before buying one at Circuit City yesterday? No. We bought a new dvd with the player to get an accurate evaluation. It worked just fine. Our only question is why doesn't the film show on the whole screen? Since we have a recorder in our satellite receiver, we probably won't record on the vcr except on very rare occaisions. We are new to dvd players and we bought the Sony because of the reputation. We knew that it didn't record dvd's so are unclear about the confusion one reviewer had over that. We rate ourselves as being techno-minus so if we can operate the stuff and get it to work right, we think that it must be user-friendly. So far no problems or complaints except for the limited screen display--that could be due to our older tv set?"
2,"Hate To Add To The Chorus Of Boos, But...","Like so many others have reported, the DVD is garbage. It came installed with a Sony Wega TV in our fifth-wheel travel trailer, and played perhaps 5 DVD films before crapping out. All we got after that was something like ""Initializing"" on a blank screen, and nothing else.However, there's a good (sort of) ending to the story. We took our RV to the dealership for some warranty work, and while there our rig and several others was/were broken into by thieves. Among the stolen items was the Sony SLV-D300P. I have happy thoughts of the confrontation between the thieves and any receiver of the stolen goods. Pawn shop owners aren't generally know to be especially nice people :-)"
1,Don't buy it!,"I bought this Sony unit thinking like everyone else that with the name came quality. Not this time. I've had it for 2 years and have struggled with it the entire time. DVD's freeze up during play, and to keep the remote working I have to take out a battery and put it back in. Since I use this remote for my Sony tv it's twice as frustrating. I don't even know where the battery cover is anymore. Bottom line, I'll never buy Sony without first shopping around and reading the reviews."
4,Good buy.,For the price this combo was a good buy and works great. Remote control is a little confusing without the instructions but you can figure out the basics. Product was described correctly and packaged well.
1,Absolute Disaster,"With a name like Sony behind it, it is embarrassing that this DVD player performs as mediocrily as it does. Every single DVD movie that we have attempted to watch tends to pixelate and/or freeze completely (forcing us to turn the machine off an back on in order to continue watching). The quality is beyond poor and very disappointing. We did play one VHS movie and it worked fine, but that's only one half of the combo, and most movie owners prefer the DVD format these days. Recording was not that good though (a blue line appears a few inches from the top of the screen).Overall, this is an absolue disaster of a player. No wonder every other reviewer has given it such poor ratings: it is not the cheapest in the market, and yet it is probably the worst DVD player that exists (and, hopefully, the only bad product in the sony catalogue). I am returning this piece of rubbish after all of our attempts to make it work. Do not waste time or money with it. It truly stinks :("
1,Crappy,"Very crappy combo from a reputed name. I got the home theater system about 10 months ago. Hooking up was no problem. The DVD worked fine initially, though as noted by some other authours, with a lag at times. Since past four months, the DVD just slowly fizzed to being nonfunctional since two months. Initially same DVD (forget the music CD's or other formats!!!) would either play or not play depending on the whim of the player.I called CS last week, and am told that if I pay ~$40, + the shipping to the california based company then they may (?) think about replacing it with another ""refurbished"" unit...got scammed.So think before you put in your precious dollars..."
1,FREEZES on almost every DVD I play!,"I got this unit to replace both my old DVD player and old VCR. Went with the Sony because it touted being compatible with all the DVD-RW/+RW formats (which is the only good thing about it). From day one, I had problems with it freezing about halfway through each DVD I watched. I think it's probably at the layer switch as it is constantly around the hour mark. In any event, to fix it, you must hit STOP then PLAY on the remote. It plays the rest of the movie fine after that. It also does many other annoying things that it shouldn't do, but there's to much to list here. It's like a college student's senior design gone wrong. I'm going to try and send it back for warranty work, but from what I've been seeing, I'm not going to hold my breath. Terrible Sony.... terrible."
2,Beware!,"I bought this unit new in the summer of 2003. Both VCR and DVD player worked well. About a week later, the DVD player began pausing, pixelating any DVD I tried to play. The Eject command didn't respond, either via remote or directly on the unit. I returned the unit to my place of purchase, exchanged it for an identical unit. Within a short time, the DVD player began malfunctioning as before. I returned again to the place of purchase, was told I'm not allowed any more returns on this unit.So now, nine years later, the VCR still works great, but the DVD player has not worked, virtually since I brought it home.Two stars for the VCR which still works."
1,Unreliable,"This is my 2nd one. My first one died and started smoking. I bought this one because it was half off, and bought a service plan. I have always loved Sony, and still have their Discman that still works after 15 years, so I trusted their quality, and thought the first dvd player dying on me was just a fluke. I have the same problems others on here have, pausing and getting stuck, even on brand new dvd's. I am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of this product and am going to have to look to a different brand from now on."
2,half and half,Here is a good one. My dvd/vcr worked flawlessly for almost 3 years. The dvd had zero issues.... until now. It seems every dvd you put into the unit freezes and stops. The sound also cuts out. My belief is after having some success with this unit and comparing that to the reviews here is that you should not take a chance on buying it. Just not worth the gamble for the price!
1,Sony hurts users again with its own copy protection,This is a nice player...but you cannot watch Sony movies on it. Their own ARccOS DVD copy protection causes this player to think that there are bad sectors on it. The disc will attempt to load and then lock up your player making it very hard to even get the disc out.
1,problems I had with the SLV-D300P,"I purchased the dvd-vhs combo at best buy and did not take the extended warranty started having problems from the start. A movie would stop while watching it took it in and it had a bad laser, got it back in about a week then my daughter got done watching a vhs tape went to eject it the door would not open by itself. took it back in got it back a week later again.Watched another dvd and it would stop at around 50 minutes to 1hr 20 min.had to send it in again it has been gone for about 3 weeks this time I guess they are waiting for parts as they say. I would say that Sonys warranty is not the best being a big name as they are. Best buy said if I would have taken the extended warranty from them they would have given me a new one. I hope if you plan on buying one that you don't have the problems I had"
1,DVD Player is seriously suspect,"I purchased one and the DVD player did not work after two weeks. It looked like a digital signal getting scrambled and delayed. Then it would just outright freeze and not respond at all. Cleaning the disc helped...a little bit, but different DVDs,including new ones, would have the same problem. Knowing Sony as a reputable brand, I returned it for a replacement. Encountered the same problem about a month in. I have a Sony cd player that's been fantastic, but this combo must cut corners somewhere, as it's a serious, and seriously frustrating problem."
1,My remote died without apparent cause,"First be aware that only the manufacturer's remote will operate this unit and there are few on-unit controls so without the remote you have a fairly useless piece of equipment. For me, out of the blue the remote just dies. I've done all Sony suggested, still nothing. Called the Sony warrenty people and they want me to send the remote off, and it will be weeks before I get it back. So, I figure I'll purchase a new remote, send the one that doesn't work off and then I'll have two. I'll need two I figure becuase they don't work. So, I call to purchase a remote and they tell me the cost is greater than 30% of what I paid for the unit and get this - they are backordered without a known shipping date and I'm told 60 to 90 days - at least! So, I sit with a useless unit. I purchase at Target, don't have the packaging and have had the unit 112 days so they won't take it back. I'm screwed!"
1,DVD stops all the time,"I got this thinking that Sony always makes quality. Up until this point it has been fairly true. After bringing this home and plugging it into my Plasma TV, I was glad that is worked the way it should. Everything looked great. Then, after about 45 minutes of watching, the picture froze. I assumed that the neighbors had a Sony remote for their TV and had it pointed in my direction. This happened time and time again. Night after night. I closed the blinds and it still stopped in the middle of a movie. This became VERY, VERY irritating. Only after realizing that there is no way a remote could be doing this, I found other people with the same problem.Thanks but no thanks Sony. You blew it on this one. Learn your lesson and never start mass-producing a product that doesn't work."
5,Czerneda is a Must Read,"One thing I've learned to expect from Julie E. Czerneda is plot twists that sometimes take you where you'd rather not be, but then, she rescues you -- somehow. She always provides characters you can bond with, laughter, tears, and just plain fun! IN THE COMPANY OF OTHERS is no exception. If anything, it's more of everything that is Czerneda. The story and characters are more mature, the conflict more personal. This is an exceptional read and a must for any serious collector of fine speculative fiction. Thank you, Ms. Czerneda!"
2,Fuzzy feelings make all the difference.,"I agree with other reviewers that it takes about 200 pages for this novel to hit on all cylinders. My qualm with the book is that until around page 400 this book was setting itself up to be a smashing hard sf book and then turned into a romance novel. If that's your bag then you'll like it.(reader rates 5 stars: Snow Crash, Dune, Void Captain's Tale)"
1,Boring version of Frederik Pohl,"The writing and plot development reminds me very much of Fredrik Pohl's Gateway (and entire Heechee series), except without anything to keep me reading it. The tension between characters seems manufactured, and nothing piqued my interest in the environs or cast."
3,Had potential yet...,"The book had potential. But it seemed to go on and on about stuff I wasn't much interested in. Verbose to the extreme about incidental things. I wanted to read about the Quill, what they were, what they did, how humans reacted to and defeated them or did not defeat them. Very little of the book addresses this. If character developement to the extreme is your preference then you might actually like the book. For me, give me lots of SF action and go easy on low-tech intrigue."
2,Time Spender,"After reading the back cover, I thought to myself that there can't be too much of a development from that idea. I was right!The first 200 pages are running idle. The author is making no real progress and nothing much is changing. Understanding what I have to cope with (this is a 576pp book), I then decided to skip to page 400 and continue. I could keep up with the story and felt that I've lost nothing by this jump.This may have been a good short story, but definitely not a novel. The idea is nice but the execution is [less than perfect].Time to move on!"
1,Could not finish,"I was unable to finish this book. I purchased it because I liked her previous books: Beholders Eye, Changing Vision and A Thousand Words for Stranger. In ""Company,"" Czerneda trys to emulate Cherryth's stationer universe, however, she fails to pull it off by a wide margin. Too much of the background is far too implausable, even for SciFi. That a space going society would suddenly retreat to stations, merely because something makes a few terraformed worlds uninhabitable, and cease all other commerce would not happen. Hopefully, after this one she will return to the the universe created in her previous books and stay there."
4,Well written and intriguing- you want to keep reading it.,"Humanity is poised on the brink of rapid expansion to beautiful, terraformed worlds when something, some unknown force suddenly begins killing off all whom visit them. Humanity survives by eeking out its survival on over crowded stations, abandoned ships and any other container capable of holding air in. No one has survived a trip to an infected deadly world... but for one man, Aaron Pardell.The book is written quite well with chapters segueing from one character's perspective into another, sometimes representing the same event from different sides and points of view. While this could be difficult to follow if too much action happens (and thus repetitively boring during the re-hash) these interludes are short and sweet and keep the reader up to date with all of the main characters.I enjoyed reading this book immensely and Julie will now be added to my list of authors to search out for."
5,"Fun single, internet, and hotseat play","Please don't buy this game if you hate Yahtzee. I'm not saying it's for everyone. I never play games like this, such as Solitare or Minesweeper (et al.), and I'm not some boring shut-in who plays ""The Game of Life"" with church-friends on Friday nights, but I couldn't stop playing once I got the CD in my drive.The other versions of Yahtzee are fun and challenging as well. Even the simplicity of Triple Yahtzee adds a great amount of depth and strategy to the game.I bought this for [money], which was well worth it."
3,Short Range - Maybe ok for a small yard,"Bought this to go with my controller. Never really use it because it range is limited to line of sight and maybe 50 to 100 feet or so. Might be okay for a small yard, but not for my half acre."
3,Limited Range but useful,"This works well for spot watering and Sprinkler Head maintenance.However, the range is less than 50-100 feet when installed:1. Outdoor Hookup: My hookup port was against a stone house wall 2 feet off the ground. Range was limited to that side of the house.2. Indoor Hookup: Hookup port was near ceiling in the garage to improve range. Range was slightly better but still can't use remote on the other side of the house."
4,Good Wholesome Fun!,"Bil Keane, has answered his mail and published a book of the readers favorite Family Circus cartoon strips of almost fifty years of excellent work. A couple hundred of the best known gems of this very popular newspaper comic strip can be found right here in: ""By Request"" a wonderful collection of this first family of laughs.The kids are innocent and smart, all at the same time. And you will always see a few of these great comics posted up in Grandma's kitchen, as she is baking some cookies. This is an American Insitution, and this volume is a fine showcase for the works of these cartoons. The strips are large enough for tired old eyes, and they've been colorized and look really nice herein.In a world that can be so frightful and deadly, The Family Circus will bring us all back to a happier place and time that really feels good.This is a very excellent book of a loving family. These cartoons are very great.Four & 1/2 Stars!"
5,"Love, laughs, tears, and just a little bit of wisdom: All in one volume","The Family Circus has been a part of my life since I first started to read the Sunday comics. Now that I'm grown, I can relive those happy memories with this book. This collection has some of the most touching moments from the most widely syndicated comic in the world. It's surely a must have for any Family Circus or comic strip lover."
5,2006 PGA Championship DVD,"I had the pleasure of being at Medinah for the Saturday and Sunday round of the 2006 PGA Championship. Because my strategy was to sit in the stands on the 1st and 18th hole, I did not have an opportunity to see Tiger's round develop except by watching the scoreboard at the 18th green. This DVD brings his play to life and is an excellent review of the skills of perhaps the greatest golfer of a lifetime."
4,Great Film!!,"I was really blown away by how thought provoking, intentional and informative this film proved to be. I wasn't sure what to expect going in, but after the first 15 minutes, I was completely engrossed in its subject matter. There are many interesting points this film raises about race relations in our country, our individual relationship with our country's past, and how we've all been affected and still are by the lingering racism that permeates even the most organic forms of physical expression and connection with the earth - surfing. Without being preachy or feeling like you're back in History 101, this movie reminds you that history (although quite relative depending on who's writing) is directly connected to the present and future. And there's a lot of great surfing and solid music to accompany... I've already recommended to several people - you don't have to be a surfer to appreciate this film. Really cool stuff."
5,Beyond expectations!!!,"This movie was completely fascinating!! I did not know what to expect, and to be honest, going in I just didn't relate racism with surfing. I was struck and saddened by the irony of a sport in which the element one ""competes"" against (the wave/creation) knows no color, and yet ""non-whites"" have had to compete against more than just the waves in order to show they belong.The historical information of surfing provided in this movie was extremely helpful. I felt that the movie went beyond just surfing and racism, but highlighted the role that perceptions (both individual and cultural) play in shaping and forming not only the choices we make in our lives, but even our ethics and values.This movie was informative, and stirred emotions that were both heart-breaking and hopeful. It is definitely a MUST SEE!"
5,A personal journey from sceptic to psychic spy,"Ingo Swann is the God-Father of the remote viewing program that started it all. Paul Smith, one of Ingo's star students, writes a cohesive and comprehensive story from the inside view of the many covert remote viewing programs and its participants over a more than 25 year time line.Paul Smith sets the story straight and fills in many details that have been glossed over by others, or just plain lied about.Many of the people claiming to have been key players in these programs are given exposure by Paul to what may have been hidden previously, and purposedly kept in the dark by these same individuals.Paul Smith as done a wonderful job of writing this story, allowing us to live with him in his own personal journey from a sceptic to a psychic spy.This book is an important addition to the few good books on the subject of Remote Viewing. It should be required reading for any person interested in this subject."
3,very complete history,This is a very thorough history of an obscure and controversial military program which was later transfered to the C.I.A. and finally terminated. I was interested that the author did not judge nor condemn other psychic processes which seem to be much less scientificly justified or supported. Telekenisis and channeling were both included as if they really exist and or actually work. I thought that the book was very informative but non critical about both psychic phenomina and military orginazition and operation.
1,Not worth the money and time.,"From cover to cover it is 608 pages, if you are slow reader like me will take you 3 months to digest the book, worst part of it. Gain no knowledge about ""Reading the Mind"" like the book title would suggested. The book should be honest about... it is all about ""Theories"", ""Hearsay"", ""non-practical"" practices. Reading it like watching a movie is Okay, but if you want to learn ""remote viewing"" from it, then you will be disappointed. The book is just not delivering."
1,"Over rated, diapponting read.","When I purchase this book, I was full of hope and execting to learn something from the author, but it is a disappointing read. It has very few teachings, instead it has lots of Star Gate theories, if I want to watch TV, then I do not need this book.This book is NOT for people who wants to learn remote viewing. And it is 609 pages, very time consuming."
3,"Adorable, but needs to fit better.","This costume is absolutely adorable, except that it is an awfully large fit. My daughter was almost 16 months old at Halloween, so I purchased the 12-18 month size. It was HUGE. It doesn't have elastic around the ankles, so when she walked, about 6 inches of the legging dragged behind her. Also, the head piece was much too large so I had to gather and safety pin it tight so it didn't fall off her head. Additionally, although the green part of the costume is a nice velour, the petals are felt, and they continually flopped over, rather than sticking up/out from her head the way the picture shows. All in all, she still got a ton of compliments about how adorable she was, but all the trouble was not worth the price."
1,Don't Judge This DVD By It's Nice Cover,"The description looked good, the price was fair, the cover was nice, but this documentary is a stinker! Here's some info that should help make up your mind if you're still thinking about forking out the $$$ for this garbage: There is no narration; There is absolutely no continuety; Most of the footage apears to be 4th generation video (very grainy); Some of the footage is incomplete; The editing is terrible (a caveman could have done better!); And, finally, The DVD ends abruptly - no closing credits, no ""the end"", nothing! Maybe the people who made this realized that they put together a piece of junk and didn't want to put their name on it.Bottom line - stay away!"
1,Beware! Does not work on induction.,"The product description includes the statement: ""magnetic stainless-steel exterior works on induction"". This is totally false. All induction cooktops will reject this pan as being nonferrous metal. A magnet will not stick to it. This is NOT an All-Clad Stainless induction pan as the description might lead you to believe. My first impression when I took this out of the box was that it is not of the quality of my other American made All-Clad cookware."
4,Taking down a terrorist network.,This book starts out with a terrorist getting plutonium to take over the oil supply in the persian gulf countries. They plan to explode the plutonium at the oil fields to render the area radioactive for hundreds of years and useless to oil production unless their demands are met. The new U.N. in the post WW III era can't protect the fields and the terrorist take over. The U.N. is powerless in its bureaucracy and want to negotiate. Ben Raines and the Southern United States of America will not agree and takes the fight to the terrorist. They go into action to stop them from using the plutonium and then to eliminate the terrorist permanently.
2,The series has gone on too long,"This installment really brings home that the series has outlived its value. The series has never paid attention to timelines as the author tries to work in today's issues. If the big one happened in the early 80's at the start of the series,there should be some credibility in the storyline. If that's not possible,hang it up. This isn't the first book to bring in a supernatural element. Early in the series there was a character called ,""The Prophert,"" an old man who wandered around and ran into Ben Raines now and then. Now we have aliens. It's been fun,but,time to stop. Retire Ben..marry off Coop and Jersey and let Buddy battle aliens in another series."

3,"Lots of internet stuff, no math stuff","Half the book is about internet.I was disapointed by the absence of math things. 1 or 2 pages could have given an overview of the main math functions. Also no string-numeric conversion functions such as str(), float()... are given. This book is definitely not for scientists or science engineers/technicians.Things presented are detailed, but they are quite limited.A fully operational code example often meaningless follows every function introduced. It would be better to my opinion to introduce the functions individualy and then show an example showing several functions in action in a script that means something."
3,Useful pocket guide.,"I bought this book so I could look up definitions and examples while sitting in tight spaces with a laptop. For that purpose it is great. It's weak on language features lacking much depth or breadth. So once you get the hang of Python this will lose its value. But it is a good starter. Also to its credit it combines discussion of the language with code examples throughout the book.As a tiny book it should probably be 4 or 5 stars, but I'll rate it as medium, 3 stars, as a pure Python reference. Nevertheless for a long while it resided in my bag as a quick reference while I got familiar with Python syntax."
2,Code sniplets are confusing,"A book like this is only useful as a reference manual into API areas your unfamiliar with. Unfortunately, after randomly using this book as a reference a few times I reverted to google.Code examples are not complete, explanations are lacking, and overall I found little value reading sections of this book independently.The authors should revise the book so each section stands on it's own without any information from other sections (sections will probably have to become slightly longer to do this / merging similar sections). The authors should provide a minimal *complete* script in each section that demonstrates the topic at hand and nothing else.In it's current form, I do not think this book is worth the purchase price."
4,good book for python beginner,"it is a good book for python beginner. in order to take step to next level, more python books need read."
1,A poor attempt... several of them actually,"Out of all the SW books I've read, Bounty Hunters was the saddest attempt I've ever seen. The only story I found worth reading was IG-88's. It's story seems plausible with the rest of the SW Universe. Bossk was too intelligent, too crafty than what other books had made him out to be. Also, his ship was made to be the most technologically advanced ship around. Dengar was at first made to superhuman in his abilities, a juggernaut, and when love hits him in the head he becomes a bumbling oaf. Zuckuss and 4-Lom was entertaining, and did give some insight into Gands and Findsman. The worst story was Boba Fett's, where he's made to be a former stormtrooper, a cop who was exiled from his world, and altogether too emotional and human from the character he's famous for. Buy this book only if you want to add to your collection of SW novels, otherwise pass it up."
2,"Two out of five, buy some other SW book","There's five stories in the book, and i've got five stars, so my two stars go to the Fett and 4LOM stories. If you were thinking that bounty hunters are ruthless and savage people, shame on you! This book sends that concept to a galaxy far, far away and presents us a Dengar that is sweeter than my grandma; and the story about not just one, but four IG88's trying to penetrate and control the MAIN computer on the second Death Star is over the top, but the worst tale is that of Bossk, who turns out to be a wimpy lizard with a ""superintelligent ship"" who is sent to jail by a couple of newcomers..and by the way, Who needs R2 units if you can have a palm-sized robot that speaks Basic and can control a ""Superintelligent ship""? (Still, Truce at Bakura is a great book)"
3,"3 good stories,2 bad ones","I can't understand why people liked the Boba Fett story.It totaly sucked!It made him out to be a goody two shoe wimp.I don't care what anyone thinks,but it was not the way the character should have been written.It was a pointless story and totally without a Star wars atmosphere.The reason I bought the book was to read that pathetic story.The IG-88 story was very good and interesting.He plans to dominate the universe and you watch the movies and you can look at him and say to yourself,""I know why he's after Solo"".The story of Denger was just as good also.You now find out his motivation for hunting solo is personal.The action in this syory never lets op.Great!The Boskk story I found to be totally boring and pointless.Pass it by.The story of 4-LOM and Zuckuss was the one I thought would be the least interesting but I was wrong.It was probably the best tale in the book.It also fit into the films the best.It maybe worth the three good stories so buy at own risk"
4,Good but not the best,"I nlove Star Wars. But only 3 out of the 5 stories were good. I have to say IG-88's and Bossk's stories sucked. But, Dengar's, 4-LOM & Zuckuss', and Boba Fett's stories were excellent."
2,"Bad, bad, bad","I bought this book as a break from continuity books, and that was my first mistake. This book is completely inconsistent with facts from the Star Wars Saga.I'm not going to go into detail of all the errors in the books, but I will name off a few.-How can Bespin have mountains when it is a gas giant? Woops-Boba Fett was retreived by Jawas, not Dengar.Dengar's story is just bad writing period. IG-88's story about hacking into the Death Star's super computer is completely inconsistent with the Star Wars saga. If I had to choose which was best, I'd choose Dave Wolverton's story about Dengar--Not because it made the most sense, but because it was good writing. I was dissapointed in the lack of writing some authors displayed in this book.Overal opinion--BAD"
3,It's okay.,"I got it when it came out. Here's my summary:The IG-88, 4-LOM/Zuckass, and Boba Fett stories are the best, especially 4-LOM's. And I love Fett's attitude! I also like the imagery in some of the stories.Skip the Dengar and Bossk stories, however. They are major letdowns. I was especially looking forward to Dengar's. Turned out to be dumb and disappointing."
3,"Some good stories, some bad stories, generally entertaining.","While most of the stories I couldn't put down, there were those I'd rather have not picked up. Case in point, the story of IG-88. But that's the chance you take when you want to know what happens next."
5,excelent except 4 zuskess and 4-lom,"if you are thinking about buying this book i would suggest it i thought it was very exciting book the only story that i thought that was kinnda lame was zuskess and 4-lom they wern't horrible but i think they weren't all that exciting. But i especilly liked Payback the tale of Dengar, and The last one standig the tale of Boba Fett those to me had a lot of action in them to me i thought they were very good."
4,decent,"A lot of these Star Trek/Star Wars books are written by real second class talent. This book was an exception. The author tries to make the bounty hunters more than just nameless evil characters, and does a decent job of creating a past for them that is believable. Ranks up there with the Timothy Zahn books."
3,This book was ok,"This book was ok, but could have been better. I liked all the stories except the Bossk one. Since I am a Bounty Hunters fan I was dissapointed. A good read for Star Wars fans."
4,A good read,"A review of the five stories: I would have to say that IG-88's story was the best of the bunch, eclipsing Boba Fett's. As an unlikely insight into the mind of a droid, it was very creative. Dengar's was one of the better stories. It didn't slow down, which was a plague of some of the other stories. Bossk's story dragged on and never really amounted to much at all. It really had no point. Zuckuss and 4-Lom was slow at times, but it was overall a good story, once again venturing into the mind of a robotic creature. Boba Fett's story was better than most of the others. It really kept the mystery and drama of Star Wars in perspective, while never revealing too much. The ending of that one was a bit disappointing, but then again, I guess a definitive ending would reveal too much. 4 Stars overall."
5,It was a really good book,"It was really cool to see the life of the bounty hunters, especially Boba Fett. They portrayed them very well in the book."
3,okay,"This book is okay. I mean,3/5 of it was good.Zuckuss and 4-lom was to hard to understand, but Bossk's was long and stupid.Borrow this book."
4,An OK book.,"This book was pretty good. But most of the stories weren't that interesting except the tale of Zuckuss and 4-LOM. The stories in this book were helpful to me because I don't know much about the bounty hunters, but after I read this book, I learned a bunch about them. Also, my favorite character of Star Wars is Boba Fett and I didn't know much about him until I read this book"
2,Bouty Hunters?,"I guess the book is ok as a book, but it hasn't got any realStar Wars feel.I didn't feel as if the book was about typical bounty hunters, more like some kind of super heroes. Take IG-88. He is trying to take over the galaxy!! Not exactly a bounty hunters job, is it?As with most Star Wars books I have read, it hasn't got the feeling of the Star Wars movies. But the book is ok if you just read it as a book, not as a Star Wars background story. Still, it is interesting to get to know the characters from the movies better, it gives a certain feeling when you later watch the movies again and think ""hah, I know who that guy is and what he is thinking""."
4,Great Book for Sw fans,"This is a great book for Star Wars fans 'cause it gives you the bounty hunters' backgrounds. I think that in the Special Edition Trilogy, Boba Fett should give the OTHER bounty hunters(IG-88,Bossk,Dengar,Zuckuss & 4-LOM) a chance to be in the spotlight. The battle that takes place between Fett and IG-88 over Tatooine should also be in on of the SpecEd films"
1,Lost all my respect for Kathy Tyers in this book.,"This book wasn't too bad. I liked all the stories. However, I lost all my respect for Kathy Tyers with that stupid Bossk story. Come on, we have one of the toughest bounty hunters, and coolest, being tooken down by 2 pointless, dumb, zeros. Its kind of like an episode of the Monkees. Where the ""heroes"" capture all the cool villains in the most kiddie ways. Like using a long rope and just wrapping it around 10 crooks which captures them. That stuff is very similar to Bossks story which is very similar to a Monkees episode. If any Monkees fans stumbled across here, I'm sorry to offend them but is my 2 cents."
5,Who needs their kind?,"Star Wars Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (Full Screen)In/famous scene on the bridge where Lord Darth Vader is interviewing the bounty hunters. Book is about the bounty hunters Darth Vader enlisted in The Empire Strikes back. There are stories about IG-88, Dengar, Bossk, Zuckuss and 4-LOM (who share a single story), and Boba Fett. Explains why Vader says ""and NO disintegrations!"""
3,Star Wars,This is a collection of short stories about the Star Wars bounty hunters. Main movie characters are not a big part of this book. Although this does help fill in some of the overall Star Wars story.
1,A really annoying book,"This is primarily a compendium of various alternative approaches to treating ADD/ADHD, with the chapters written by different contributors. A few chapters/contributors are helpful and reasonable, some chapters are stating the obvious (I need a chapter to tell me soft drinks are unhealthy?), and many chapters simply offer their authors a venue to peddle snake oil. I confess, many chapters I simply didn't get to, because I couldn't face another page of histrionics about the authors' brilliant cures and the drug companies' evil conspiracies to suppress them. (Note the upper right-hand corner of the cover: if this book really had the ""1st Documented Cure for Autism"", wouldn't this bit of news rate more than a square inch of their cover?)The worthwhile information I found here is mostly available online as well. Save your money."
2,a wedding band,"warning this is a live audience cd.it sounds like it was recorded at someone's wedding.if you like bobby darin look elsewhere, thisis better left alone. it only cost 1 cent and shippingso its on the way to goodwill."
1,um... fake reviews anyone?,"I bought this book several years ago, never finished it because, frankly, I didn't find it that interesting. It has a bookmark at page 113 and I guess i never bothered to pick it up again. This book has 11 5-star reviews, as of today. What I find very strange is that all these five star reviews are written by people who have only reviewed this book. In all cases it is the first and last review any of them have ever written. So I guess either the author had all her friends write reviews, or she or a friend decided to do a little dishonest marketing by writing multiple reviews under fake accounts. If a book is any good the author/friends of author would not need to plant fake reviews to get people to buy it."
1,Master of Disaster,"Let's get a review from Rob Butts, Jane's husband. He would say this book has nothing to do with the Seth Material and it is pure pomp and circumstance..with an added EGO and Ambition aspect from the author."
2,Dissapointed in this book. Not impressed by ideas for customizing clothes & home accessories.,"I received my book today and find it very dissapointing. I find more wonderful sewing ideas in one or two issues of a sewing magazine such as Threads, Australian Stitches, Machine Embroidery (Australian mag), etc. The book's projects were not interesting, the directions weren't too clear and the pictures might win a photo contest for photography creativity but the photos did NOT show the finished products clearly. This format is not a good format for a sewing book. There were not too many projects. I find more projects & better projects on a visit to a sewing machine website. I'm anxious to hear what other people's opinion on this book is. Maybe others find the projects more to their liking. This could be a matter of taste. None of the projects were my cup of tea. So, if you have a chance to look at this book or if you own it, please also review it."
1,A Poor Product,"This product simply did not work well. The labeling on the box is misleading because it states that it can make ice cream in 30 minutes. But the reality is that the process takes a minimum of 24 hours if you count the preparation time. OK, fine. However, when I attempted to pour the mixture into the machine (following the directions) it froze up and would not operate at all. I ended up having to mix the ice cream by hand for 20 minutes. It tasted fine (and it was thick), but that was largely because of my own preparation. The moving parts are made of plastic (not very sturdy). You will also learn when you read the instructions that you can't put nuts or pieces of fruit in the ice cream mixture because that might ""damage"" the machine. Bottom line, it didn't work as promised. You will probably be disappointed."
1,Good Idea but did not work well,The ice cream maker was easy to assemble but it would not quite freeze the ice cream enough. The plastic parts seem like they are designed to last about 2 weeks. I had to run it an extra 15 minutes and even then the ice cream was runny but the motor was about to burn up. The ice cream was good after I froze it overnight but I would stick to the conventional ice and salt method after this experience. Mine is going back to the place I bought it.
1,Don't waste your time or money,You need an engineering degree to assemble and work this turkey. The instruction booklet leaves much to the imagination. The ice cream was OK but not worth the agravation. Drive to McDonald's for their soft serve vanilla cone and save yourself the stress of putting this together and making it work.
2,Disappointed,"I believe the box and advertising should have held more information. Although I did manage to get some soft serve ice cream, it took much longer than the instructions said. Following their time schedule, I had soup. I didn't mind the extra time so much as the fact that every single recipe included was made with powdered milk. I could taste the overwhelming powdered milk taste no matter what I tried. I contacted the company about finding different recipes and they said not to use any other recipes than the ones included, and that they had no other recipes available. I wanted an ice cream maker where I can have a variety of recipes, and one where fruits, nuts or candies can be added. Nowhere does it say how limited this machine is until you open it up after purchase. I'm selling mine for 50 cents in a yard sale, and will chalk it up to an expensive mistake."
2,"Fragile, breaks easily, does not get ice cream quite there.","We've had this for awhile, and we use it, but it is really not too well made. The motor seems underpowered, the plastic parts are not durable (latches that hold top on break out of mounts, easily), and it does not seem to have the oomph of motor or coldness to get the job all the way done."
4,Delicious!,"I&#146;ll have to admit the first time I used it I got not-so-good soft serve ice cream. But I decided to try it a second time and it was incredible! I found if you followed the instructions exactly you would get real soft serve swirls. The first time I tried to use lower fat milk and it didn't work well. My favorite recipe, so far, is the milk chocolate! My family loved it. I can&#146;t wait to try the other recipes. Thanks Rival!"
3,Good ice cream maker,"I got this ice cream maker at a garage sale for $2.50 and it was in amazing condition, came with the instructions and everything. It works pretty good. Its a bit noisy and it takes a little while but it made ice cream! Of course its soft ice cream and thats what I was expecting when I made ice cream in it. I think its a good machine so far!"
4,It works pretty good!,"I bought this for my kids a year ago. We made the chocolate ice cream. The machine did seem like the motor was going to burn out. I shut it down for 10 minutes and turned it back on. It was fine. I had to let it churn for 20 minutes longer than the recomended time, but in the end it was worth it.The ice cream was fabulous!Only problem now, we moved into a new house and I can't seem to find the manual with the recipes. I can't find it on line either. This site has it in PDF, but it's french only. Well that would be fine if I could read french. Can anyone help? Maybe scan the cook to PDF for me???Thanks!redmudspud@gmail.com"
1,Soggy Mess,I attempted various recipes that were provided with the machine - all turned out a bit soggy.
4,All-Clad 2 Quart Rice Pot,"I love my new pot. It's a bit small, but just the right size for what I want. It cleans up in a flash too. Excellent quality for the price. I would recommend it for anyone who doesn't need a huge pot."
3,The Beginning of the End...,"The passing of Hector at the end of Season 3 was also the death of this delightful and endearing series. The writing and direction in Season 4 is unpredictable and the characters lose their quirky, lovable shine as they constantly act in ways that are contrary to the characters we grew to know in Seasons 1-3, often with little rhyme or reason. It begins to feel as if the writers and director had not actually watched the first 3 seasons.From Season 4 onward, there are several new characters and story arcs and the series becomes a completely different show. Season 4 is the transition to the ""new"" Monarch of the Glen that is seasons 5-7 and a rocky, troubled transition it is."
3,monarch losing its edge,"loved first 3 series, this one losing its edge, goofy, simple plot lines, disappointing, picked up a little by end of series"
4,Monarch of the Glen: Complete Series 4,"Not up to the first three seasons, we got used to the earlier characters, but to bad they had to knock off Hector and get rid to many others"
4,Balanced View,"I liked this bio of jk..ive read many and this seems the most fair. It has alot of commentary from ppl who knew her..which is the only way one could learn about this intensly private person anyway. Alot of people recomend other books on Jackie, like America's Queen (great photos) or The Kennedy Years, but in my opinion most books portray her as too angelic, as to be unrealistic. If I felt that this book was all about ""dirt"" i wouldve given it 1 star, but on the contrary I think its very balanced: some people say they liked jackie, some thought she was a snob, in reality, they're probably both right, depending on who they were and when they met her (as it is with most of us)"
4,Fascinating!,"This gives you everything you've ever wanted to know about Jackie Onasis. It also mentions on the first page that Jackie's mother's family were ""lace curtain Irish."" Many people mistakenly believe that Jackie was all French, but she was actually half French. Her mother's family emigrated from Cork, Ireland, and her grandfather had a rags to riches story. That wealth is the main reason that Jack Bouvier married Jackie's mother, Janet Lee. The whole book is exciting, and I would recommend it to anyone."
3,More than I wanted to know,"I just discovered this book. There isn't much in it that I had not read elsewhere except there is too much about JFK and his skirt chasing. After awhile it gets boring to read about all of escapades. I've lost a lot of respect for him.I was surprised to read that Jackie did not actually spend much time at the White House, but was always traveling. There is a lot we did not know at the time. It is hard now to know who to believe."
2,read anything other than this,"There are so many other books about jackie kennedy. The best are ""Mrs. Kennedy: The Missing History of the Kennedy Years"". It gives such great insight into the marriage of Jack and Jackie Kennedy. It has many excellent interviews with white house insiders who knew both very well. Another is America's Queen. These two books do an excellent job of not focusing on simply retelling the stories of Jackie's life but examning her life and the choices she made. The books I just mentioned are not puff pieces and they are not dedicated, like this book is, to showing the ""dark side"" as if these two peolple were only pitiful, sad people. Jackie Kennedy Onassis was a extreemly complex person, something this book simply does not express enough."
5,"Excellent details, very juicy read!","Surprisingly, this book is better than a similar effort by Kitty Kelley (Jackie Oh!). There are a lot of historical details and it covers more of Jackie's life."
3,"decent, Kitty Kelley, tabloidesque book on Jackie","This is actually not too bad of a book on Jackie Kennedy, just a little too tabloidesque in style. That said, there are some gems inside---Secret Service agent Marty Venker's opinions on JFK's extra-marital affairs and his confirmation that Jakcie was angry at Secret Service agent Bill Greer for not speeding up the limousine in time to save her husband's life on 11/22/63. Worth a look.Vince Palamara"
2,A bit disappointing really,"Well this film certainly rates a mixed bag.On the plus side BCI did an outstanding job with the transfer the picture quality is A+.And given that you'd expect that this film was going to be a total Exorcist rip-off and it's not that's good too.Now for the bad news Exorcism is quite dull and is more of a dysfunctional family drama than a horror film.Yes there are horror elements but at it's core the film examines the fallacy of the ""perfect family"" .You know the sitcom ones like on 8 is Enough or The Cosby Show.The effects are VERY low budget but it's kinda neat seeing stop motion photography like they used in the 70's unlike todays endless CGI effects.There are a few neat surprises and Paul Naschy is fine as he usually is as the priest.The actress who plays the bratty girl that get's possessed was good too.If you like euro horror and 70's cinema in general you might enjoy this film.It certainly is tons better than The Antichrist which was utter fecal material."
4,good until the wdescreen edition gets released,Nice transfer including some good extras with Paul Naschy introducing the film and discussing his career. Too bad it's only the fullscreen version. I would definitely get this in a widescreen release as well.
5,not bad seris,this is a good seris I rather enjoy it tho its the 2nd in a seris comeplte the charaters in this is from another seris so I recomend you buy both sets so you will know who is who and such a young man starts school finds the home he lived in then some gurls who have the same pic as him moves into his home as well its close to every day life they have their good n bad days they learn to be together and become a family its touching sweet and good to watch you will wanna own this one as well to your collection I enjoyed it very much
4,good second season of Please Teacher,If you liked Please teacher then you will like the humor of this (Please Twins)Ok you have to buy that Japanese Orphans can live on there own while going to high school.but for Please Teacher you had to beleve a high school student could be married to his teacher who is aalein from outer space.I recomend seeing Please Teacher frist because it will help with Please Twins and it's a better story.
5,This is THE book for interior painting techniques,"Home Improvement books tend to be either too verbose or deal with multiple subjects that are just too vague and off the subject. This is one of the exceptions. All common interior painting techniques are discussed, along with great pictures. The book doesn't stray from the subject at hand by showing you the author's home remodeling project.In addition, there is a discussion of color and what it does to a space with a great sequence of photographs of the same room in different shades.Having purchased many books on home improvement, this one gets top honors."
3,"Should be called ""Preparation for painting your home""",I bought this book thinking it would show many different decorating/painting techniques. This isn't really the case. It mainly shows how to prepare a room for decorating.
2,Extremely Basic,This book is for the person who is paintng for the first time. There are very few tips for the person who has actually painted in the past.
5,Dinosaur Tales by Ray Bradbury,"A collection of short stories and poetry by renowned sci-fi author Ray Bradbury- the author of 'Fahrenheit 451', and the classic fifties monster flick ""Twenty Million Miles to Earth"". Includes ""So you want to be a dinosaur when you grow up?"" and the excellent ""A Sound of Thunder"". Beautiful illustrations by a number of esteemed fantasy artists. Contains possibly the best description of a T-Rex in the whole of literature. Move over Michael Crichton!"
5,Perfect fit,Perfect fit in a Honda CRV - keeps my new car free of dog hair and salt stains - well made
3,OK for occasional use.,"Concept and design are nice, and it fit well in my truck. Good for occasional use, but my Shepherd goes to work with me almost every day, and this isn't holding up to the wear and tear. Many of the rivets have pulled out, and are now big torn holes. Also didn't do well with washing, the padding seems to have broken down. Overall, kind of disappointed with the purchase."
3,Okay product,"I have this pet hammock for almost a year now. I have a 60lb lab. I like the water proof canvas material and it covers the back seat well enough from dirt, debris and fur. It's a too big for my mid-size SUV (I have a rav4) so I have to make adjustments to the front seat clasps.The zipper in between is supposed to be good if you have one backseat passenger, however I find that the because of the zippers, there is a hole in the middle of the hammock that allows some debris to come through into the crevices of my seat. Every time I take the hammock out, I have to clean that crevices. Also, by now, the buttons for the front seat don't snap as well anymore and it kept popping off. and the metal rings for the rear seats have come off from the bungee cords. I never place this hammock to the washing machine, but I find that my dog's fur sticks onto the canvas material, so it's not enough for me to take the hammock out and brush it off, I have to use a vacuum."
4,pet hammock,"good product. Heavy duty and my 80lb dog loves it!! Wish it was better suited for sharing the back seat with a person, but other than that a great product."
3,Not ideal for all cars,This hammock is way too big for my car- which I wish I knew before purchasing. I could also have used some hints or instructions to install it in a smaller car.Its clearly a well made hammock and I'm sure fits will with larger vehicles.
4,Good quality,"This was actually a better quality than I was expecting based on previous reviews. The cover is thick with padding so it provides great protection for my leather seats. It fits perfectly for my A4 backseat (so may be small in width for some vehicles.) I wasnt crazy about the bungee straps as I have had bungee cords release & break a window before, but I was able to make them fit well without feeling like they would slip loose. My 60# dog is well behaved & doesnt move around much, but the headrest straps felt secure & sturdy. The side can fold up when he is jumping into the car, but that would be the case with any hammock type cover. My only negative is that there is no hole in the cover for seatbelts & I usually have my dog buckled in.Overall I am very happy with this product, especially given the price! Was just what I needed to allow the dog in the new car!"
2,Chemical smell,"The item was okay, but it has a bad chemical smell that hasn't yet gone away in over one month despite hanging it outside in fresh air and sun."
4,Guardian Gear Hammock,"I have a Tacoma Access cab so I suspected this seat cover (any seat cover) was going to be difficult to use, I ordered anyway hoping I could get it to work. It was easy to install and I added a few extra bungie cords to help it in my case. It is adequate for my use. I doubt that I could find anything to work better. Quality and construction appear good. We'll see how it holds up under my large dogs."
3,"I like it, but...","Concept is great. But.... headrest covers to hold in place do not fit on all cars/trucks if you have large head rests, it won't work. I had to come up with my own fix. Also with leather seats, my 80# dog moves the cover around a bit. Could really use side connections. Once I made my own changes to the cover, it works fine. But..."
5,Execellent.,This has bungee stretches so even if the car stopps suddenly the dog is safe and does not come through the front 2 seats. Fabric nice for dog. The first one i bought at a pet store broke after 2 rides. it had to Bungee cords to help it be flexible.
3,Love the product but poor customer service if it breaks,"I've had the hammock for about 4 months now and love it! it gives full coverage for my backseat in my Rav4 and the dog likes it. However, the zipper head recently broke and when I contacted the seller to either replace or repair it, I was told they would not replace it as it had been used already and they do not repair as well. The fact that it was poor zipper quality that led to this, did not mean anything. Great product but hopefully it doesn't break down on you otherwise your out of luck!"
3,ok...for an SUV or truck,"I have a compact car and this bunched up in the middle. It also sagged between the front seats so that hair and drool could get on us. I do have a 70 lb dog but he is quite docile. The snaps that hold it to the headrest would never stay snapped. They were of poor quality. I wish I had paid more for a better quality. This would probably be an ok solution if you have an SUV and a small dog...otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Useless...will just use blankets,"The first time I used this product it ripped!! I have a very calm dog who just walked on the seat and sat down, and the canvas tore. I am very disappointed and would not recommend the pet hammock due to inferior quality. Don't waste your money!"
4,Really Good Hammock,"I purchased this hammock to proctect my leather seats and it works great. I didn't realize just how much ""sandy"" dirt were in my dogs' paws, but the hammock caught all of the dirt, etc., when my dogs get in the car. I love that it protects the inside of my car, but now I have to figure out a way to use my doggie seatbelts with the hammock. I also have a problem keeping the headrest covers on my headrests but I think once the hammock relaxes it will be fine."
4,Nice wood top,"I like the wooden seat, but wish they had made the vinyl legs wood toned to match. To me the bright white legs are not harmonious with the good looking wooden seat.It is comfortable enough and doesn't take up much room. The front leg has an adjustable tip which is good since the shower slopes down to the drain a bit.I recommend wiping off the top each time after showering to remove beads of water, though it seems to shed the water pretty well. Be careful when putting your foot up on it (like for shaving your legs), as it can tip."
3,Realistic and moving,"LYNELLE BY THE SEA is one of those books where you know there will not be a happy ending ala Jane Austen, but yet things come to a very human and satisfying resolution. The author gives her characters the chance to rise to the occasion of bad times, and lets Annie and Lynelle live through them with valor and honesty. As a reader I am grateful that this book never approached sappy sentimentality, but kept me in tune with the characters' pain. This book will have extra resonance for mothers (I am not one myself but still recommend the book)."
4,Great Temporary Solution,"Our windows are very old and drafty and they need to be replaced soon. This is a great temporary solution to fill in all the cracks around the window frame until next spring when we replace all of our windows. We've had near freezing temperatures in the evenings already, and it does a great job eliminating the draft.This stuff is kind of like of ""Play-Dough"". The only complaint I have is the when I try to unroll one cord at a time, it breaks off. I was trying to keep the installation as ""clean"" looking as possible, but that's difficult to do when you are using a ""band-aid"" solution like this.UPDATE 12/22/12I forgot I used this to seal one of the windows in our garage but today I went to remove it and it's still as pliable as the day I opened the package (two years ago). Pretty impressive if you ask me!"
5,AgeDoesn't Matter unless you're a cheese,"A serious subject presented in a humorous manner.Easily read, hilarious and thought provoking. It will keep you in 'stitches'. M.Phyllis HIll"
4,Touching,"This book is a work of art. It's written in language simple enough to be in the mind of a nine-year-old child, yet compelling enough to hold your interest. The story grabs you immediately and won't let you go. (We won't talk about all the things I've been late for since beginning this book, lol.) The characters are rich and entertaining. One minute you'll want to shake their teeth out and the next you'll wanna hug the stuff out of them. The journey of Mara, one little step at a time, reveals the true beauty, grace, and mercy of God and all His angels who wear skin.I recommend this book, no matter what your normal tastes are. Watching the Tree Limbs has it all, mystery, romance, suspense, and most of all, genuinely wonderful storytelling.I can't wait for the sequel. Hurry up, Mary!"
5,Book made of glue!,"Ms.Demuth has written a book which must be made with glue from the heart, I could not put it down. Mara is girl who has little adult support and much fear. From the start I felt I knew the characters. Zady, the lady who knows and cares, Mara's closest friend and the mystery man who watches out for those who have no voice, they all seem so real I feel I know them.This book will be the talk of the town soon. I am ordering a few more to share as giftys for friends and family."
3,WATCHING TREE LIMBS - A BETTER TITLE THAN BOOK,I think this is a young adult book even though the subject is about a young girl being molested.I felt that is did not have much substance and was a-typical.
5,Grace lighting dark places,"In the tradition of ""Secret Life of Bees"" or ""Peace Like a River"", Ms. DeMuth introduces a young character's journey and invites us inside her skin. We feel the heat of the Texas sun, the pain of abuse, the longing for connection and family. Even though the subject matter is truthfully tough, each chapter is infused with grace. The writing is lyrical and hopeful even when confronting brutal realities. The story deepened my compassion for children who suffer in silence and reminded me that although there aren't always easy answers one person's acts of love can make a difference."
3,Works with a bit of effort,"This is basically a good product, but the auto-return mechanism was badly engineered. The problem is that the golf ball usually has too much speed when it passes by the mechanism. so by the time the auto-return has triggered it clips the ball instead of wacking it. I solved this by screwing a screw into either side of the mechanism; the ball hits these screws and slows down and the ball is wacked back to the end of the mat. This exposed another problem; the auto-return mechanism would recoil and the ball was not wacked hard enough. I solved this by glueing the mechanism to the plastic frame it was sitting in. The resulting product works very well, and is fun to play with. Except .... if you hit the ball too hard, it can go over the top of the ball return shute and you have to fetch it."
4,grandson loved it,"bought this product for my grandson for christmas and it performed exactly the way it was supposed to and even better than i thought, his putting has improved already. and he loves it!! the price was good too."
2,Messy,This food makes a mess. Its very light and starts to fall apart as soon as it hits the water. My water was cloudy within a week of using it.
5,great,"Was in very, very good condition.I recommend this seller.I would like to buy more of this from him."
1,Silver Needs a New Copy Editor,"I was very disappointed in this book. There's really nothing new or enlightening about it. The tone of this book is different than her other books, she comes across here as condescending. There are many typing errors and in one place, a list of zodiac signs, she completely leaves out Aquarius and Pisces. In the last chapter, we get yet another list of herbs and their uses. How many times can you make lists and call them books? Her other books are great beginner books. This one was described as more advanced. There's nothing advanced here, just a bunch of WAY-too-complicated rituals, silly poems and uninspired artwork. As an author, if you're only as good as your last book, Silver is in trouble."
1,Please don't do this to yourself,"As a practicing witch, who works with teenagers in their spiritual development, I cannot say how detrimental S.R. books have been. Nor can I say how many young people I've had to deprogram from this one, hardly revolutionary, barely useful viewpoint, so that they can learn anything else but this drivel. Having spoken with others who work in a similar vein, the sentiment is repeated over and over.There are so many good books out there to help a person on their journey as they develope; why saddle yourself with this sort of self-aggrandizing, exaggurative, at times ridiculous blather?"
3,Silver's done better...,"Normally, I devour RavenWolf's books but I couldn't quite get into this one. I like the cover and artwork, but I wasn't very impressed with it overall. I'm very into herbcraft so when I got to the last part of the book with the index of herbs, I realized that that section redeems a lot of the book. Although it doesn't mention some of the herbs I have (Rose of Jericho, Maidenhair Fern, etc) there were some that I hadn't heard of, so I guess you could say I learned something new from it. I liked the spells for the herbs, which could have been formatted better, but they were still informative and interesting.I got this book as a gift, so I guess I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it. If you do want it though, just for the section on herbs, get it used."
1,not for my 2001 celica,"After searching for serpentine belt for 2001 toyota celica, Amazon search led me to this part. It will not fit the specific car because it's size is WITHOUT AC. Never seen a 2001 celica without AC. I was curious enough to goggle a 2001 without AC, couldn't find any info. Even the label on the belt say it's for GM engine.Amazon search has led me to a wrong belt and has caused me a Saturday."
4,Perfect size,"Garden flag is the perfect size for the yard stake I have. Colors are sharp, nylon is great quality. I haven't tried the window suction cups but im sure they work fine."
2,Broke,Stopped working after a short while. It's a cheap piece of junk--you get what you pay for in this case.
3,Classic,"First of all, this game is old. Its graphics [are not good], so does its sound. With that out of the way, it is pretty cool. It has fun weapons an codes especially. After about four levels, you will tire of the game becuse its a labyrinth, often to find where youre going. Luckily, many awesome levels, patches, and other things are availiable online, ehich makes the computer game fun. If youre going to get it: Get the comp one, becuase other wise its a waste of money"
1,Why did I buy this?,"I have not yet finished this game but I hate it already. Because of being blinded by the Star Wars title,I have purchased one of the worst graphiced games out there. Not only do the graphics stink,but it is like so many other 1st person shooting games with weird power-ups and medipacks. I'm sorry die-hard Star Wars fans,even you guys might not like this, not to mention non-fans, you will hate it. I'm sorry to say this didn't even get close to my normal Star Wars game expectations. So unless you want that old Wolfenstien effect, do not, I repeat, do not purchase this cheesey game.(I suggest that Georgy put Dark Forces 2,(which I've heard is much better)onto Playstation Two or something."
5,Great,"I have this CD set to my dad for his birthday, and he loves it! There's a great variety of country songs. Also, an interesting feature is that each CD has songs strictly by female or male artists."
4,A highly innovative but quite specialized angle!,"For those familiar with the technology and terminology of Kohonen's self-organizing maps, this book is a highly recommendable asset. The insights on the deficiencies of various previously developed techniques and how to improve them are brilliant. Although the matter is presented in a very bottom-up fashion, it is sometimes hard to keep focusing on the big picture while all the different aspects are in-depth explored. This makes the book sometimes hard to understand. Although it was probably never intended to be easily understandable, this is the reason why I didn't give it the full 5 stars."
4,a distant relationship,"Jo Hammett's book about her father, fabled tough-guy writer Dashiell Hammett, includes many family photos and documents never before seen by Hammett enthusiasts. The book, printed on glossy paper, is visually appealing. Jo Hammett's description of her childhood years, when her father's presence was a treat and time spent with him seemed magical, must be weighed against her growing realization that her parents were hopelessly mismatched, that her father was an intensely private man who shared his life with no one, not even his long-time mistress, Lillian Hellman.Her father found his niche in American publishing, and is beloved by many readers devoted to his hard-boiled style. His family life, or the lack of it, may take some of the sheen from his image. A pervasive sadness invades this book."
2,Her Father's Daughter,"One star is for the lovely photographs (many of which I've never seen in any other Hammett or Hellman biography or memoir) and the other is for the candor with which the author speaks of her father. Unfortunately, she doesn't really go into much depth about their relationship and deals with her sister, Mary, and that relationship in a superficial fashion. The author has an idealized and rather limited view of the relationship between her parents. Josephine Hammett reveals more of herself, and evokes more sympathy for what could have been between father and daughter, rather than shed any new light on Hammett, the man or the father."
4,Stuggle is the key word!,"This book was awesome. I loved it. I could not put it down. The story was told in terms that everyone could understand. The book follows wonderfully.If you are looking for a book that deals with women's rights and the struggles that they must endure, this is a good one to pick. I had to read this book for a history of Latin American class. It really helped us as atudents understand the situation that Ms. Betancourt was facing in Columbia. As well as, understand some of the choices she made.As a female reader it stirred my emotions. I highly suggest ths book as an educational read, or just a for the fun of it read."
1,DON'T BELIVE IT!,"From an American man living in Medellin Colombia.Before you waste your money on this ladies book read a few others, like ""Out of Captivity""This cold hearted selfish princess, born with a silver spoon in her mouth, tried to have the American contractors held in captivity with her killed, just to feather her own nest. She set up her own little kingdom in the jungle and used, and seriously endangered, many other people for her own comfort.She is NOT well liked nor even respected in Colombia. They know who she is. That's why she doesn't live here.Ingrid Betancort is selfish spolied princess and a chronic liar trying to rewrite history, twisting the truth, just to make herself look good. As if she is come kind of hero.NOT TRUE! SHE IS A COWARD OF THE WORST KIND! PLEASE DO NOT GIVE HER ONE PENNY TO SUPPORT HER LIES!"
5,Captivating book,"Ingrid has made mistakes, and has paid for them dearly. However her courage and conviction can never be questioned.Some of these one star ""reviews"" have nothing to do with the literary work she did in this book. You do have to be familiar with the political situation in Colombia at the time this book was written, but that aside, it is so captivating and well written, that you won't be able to put it down."
1,what a lie,"What a waste of money and time, this woman is full of lies and more lies, what a horrible way to waste time...This woman is a fake."
1,Poor and mostly fake story,"I'm Colombian and unfortunately thought 'd be interesting reading some more about her case but after a couple pages I'd to put it back. Lost my money and my time and even worst it hurt my love for my country. All what you'll find here is a book full of lies of somebody trying to appear as the mayor victim in the world but she won't tell you the true why she got into this problem and the things she has done against our country. All what she cares is about making a lot of money using her case, but she won't do anything at all to help anybody even so that she's living and moving into the high classes in France and around the world. Very Sad; She's just not a nice and reliable person."
1,are we talking about the same book?,"I read the book and all reviews... Great example of such divide society, one side in denial, the book, the other just suffering (our real society). The books fails to address the big issues properly. It is overbearing, and arrogant. I wonder if the author has noted the actual meaning of her ""reclaiming of Colombia""... Has she ever look at Colombian history from a critical perspective of those that contributed to the actual mess? Oligarchies... Landlords, etc. NO!! Sorry, You cannot claim, you have to give back!!!"
1,Well past its sell by date,"While Kastan writes very well, this book suffers both from being derivative (it pales in comparison to the work of much better critics such as Stephen Greenblatt) and out-of-date. Much of what Kastan publishes here was written and first presented in the mid-1980s. I would go elsewhere for fresher, more stimulating work on Shakespeare."
5,great read.,"This book rocks. I'd have to rank it with the best scholarship of Beckham, Giggs, and Yorke. I put this book right at the top of the premiership and it should do well in Europe too."
2,duhhhhh....i donno?????!!!???,"I just wrote this revue so i can gat a chaNCE TO WIN A $50 gift certificate!!!!!! HA HA.... HA, HA HA,HA HA HA HA"
4,Completely adorable,"Incredibly cute; depicts the cat from the anime very well. The head is a bit heavy and it does topple over. When it came in the mail the whiskers were squished a bit, but it's no problem. Good memorabilia for those who enjoyed the anime."
3,Expectations,"Honestly I was really upset that it was so small. Dimensions should be listed! When I first saw it I though ""Oh I can't wait to cuddle and hug it!"" But it literally fits in the palm of my hand. :( And it's not as soft as it looks."
3,Product not in mint condition as advertised!,"This is a very interesting and intriguing book but unfortunately, the copy I received in the mail was not in ""mint condition"" as it was advertised on Amazon. There is some type of stain and/or water damage on the inside and outside spine of this copy and it looks like the book itself was in storage for a very long time. There was also a lot of dust on the paper cover which made the book look used and old. A shame because the contents of the book are a very good read. I will not buy from this particular book vendor (Cogswell) again."
2,Not so good,"The item took a while to get, but was in excellent shape. Unfortunately, Mike Marino rehashes the same routines and just is not that funny any more. I would recommend the seller, but not the item."
3,Too short too easy,Barely broke a glisten. Not worth the 25 bucks save your money. Too short 20 minute workout not enough to feel the burn.
3,Good Supplement,It won't make you lose a lot of weight but its a great supplement and a new routine to break up you workout schedule. It helps with stretching so it can compliment any workout. Its easy to follow and I enjoy doing it. Try it! but just know you'll have to do more to see results. This alone will not make you lose the weight you need to lose if you're looking at over 5 lbs.
5,DEFINITELY FEELING THE BURN!,I like this dvd. It's short but effective. I'm still feeling the burn 2 days later!!!
5,So far so good.,"I don't know yet if I can tell a difference because I've only been using it for 2 weeks. I love the work out though! It is not easy and definitely builds strength!! It's quick enough (about 15 minutes) that I can add it on to any work out. Also, pilates is apartment-friendly. There is no jumping around and disturbing the people below you. That's always a positive!!"
5,Great Fill In,"I bought this video on the recommendation of my pilates instructor at the gym. I injured my right knee last year, and have not been able to work my legs as aggresively since then. Consequently, I felt like by [...] and legs were not looking too hot. =( I agree that this video by itself would not be a good enough work out, but it is a great, short morning workout to do on off days. By the way, you will get WAY more out of the workout if you focus on keeping perfect form."
4,good buy,i like this set of dvd's they are easy to follow and at a good price. and i am sure they would work if i used them!
1,not for me!,I wish I had not purchased this dvd. I am have been doing the Tracy Anderson mat workout for over a year now and I wanted something different to target my butt and thighs. I thought this would work and while it was challenging. It was not what I was hoping for. I have only used the dvd twice since opening it up.I would not recommend this to anyone that likes to burn alot of calories and sweat it out.
5,Pickapeppa Sauce,"I've been using Pickapeppa for at least 25 years. My mother-in-law introduced it to me when she would pour it over cream cheese for an appetizer. My sons have grown up with having it always in the frig. for steaks, chicken, cream cheese or whatever! It's still not available in all the grocery stores but found it much easier just to buy it by the case. It never lasts long, though!"
5,Delicioso !!!,"One of the best sauce condiments in the world , try mixing with a little bit of catsup , to extend or mellow the taste a bit !"
5,Carpetbagger's Wife,"I read a great deal. Not just romance, but everything that comes my way, and I often find it difficult to discover an author who delivers a well written, well-told story each and every time. Deborah Hale doesn't just come my way; I seek her books out. In Carpetbagger's Wife, Hale delivers in a big way. Her imagery is fresh and evocative, her characters a wonderful balance between heroic and down to earth, and her setting of post Civil War in Northern Virginia comes alive through Hale's attention to detail. I have ice and snow outside my window as I write this, but I swear I smelled flowering dogwood on an April breeze the minute I started reading Carpetbagger's Wife."
2,Just not that readable,"Nicholas Hyde works and lives in a world where offshore cloning and hybrid technology are restricted to very few countries in the world. Working as humanitarian volunteer in the Congo Nicholas stumbles across a terrifying secret, a horror beyond imagination.Well if the book was as interesting as the basic premise it might have read a little better, but I have to say I struggled with this one. Cliché personal sacrifice, all too convenient coincidental characters and a back-story which I had trouble swallowing.I couldn't connect with our good mate Nicholas, couldn't of cared whether he lived or died. I found I started to guess what would be on the next page and often found no surprise when the guess was right.If you're a mad, mad fan of future-genetic-technology-gone-wrong kind of stories then you might, just might get some legs out of it. For me I'm sorry to put the boot in with such a harsh review, but this is one book I won't read twice."
1,One star for the idea... zero stars for the style.,"I was hoping this would be an entertaining read... but this was one book I just couldn't finish. I was greatly disappointed in the writing style... for example:""Nick pushes the Glock into the waistband of his trousers, kneels by the body and probes the mess of one of the ragged chest wounds, feels something hard slide around and digs it out and shows it to Harmony.""I find the present tense style to be very annoying... and was so distracted with the use of the tense that I could not begin to enjoy the book. I quit about one-third of the way through... and only got THAT far because I was forcing myself, since I didn't want to admit that I had wasted $7.99 on the book. If you don't mind the use of present tense, go ahead and try ""White Devils""... since the story isn't so bad. But I just couldn't stand it."
5,Get this!,"This is a fun toy! It includes: 4 cups, 4 plates, 4 spoons, milk jug, honey pot and a teapot. Don't expect a tray though. You press the lids and hear princess songs like 'la-la-ing' and whistling. Tilt the teapot to take lids off and to hear pouring noises. When the princesses stop talking they let you pour, press their 'song' button and talk back. All the while, a red light is on to tell you that you are free to talk.It is educational because it provides an interest in tea-time for kids and they can practice serving tea.It is durable, nothing will fall apart or break, I assure you.It is VERY fun, the way it does stuff. My brother likes to play with me with it and my Daddy says its good. I reccomend buying a plastic food set to go with it. The pictures are elegant and pretty.Any little girl will love serving up some coffee or tea, adding milk or honey and listening to Princesses talking!Perfect for dolly tea parties!Bye!"
1,come with problems!!!,Works only 3 hours !! Problems with the regulator of voltageIts came with a screw without fittingrememberThe cheap thing works out expensive
1,"once again, a failed arguement","This book takes a much more objective approach to presenting a theory of Intelligent Design yet fails to deliver and ends up failing in the same way every other pro ID book fails: bad science, logic, and premise. The major benefit of this book is a somewhat rigorous attempt to examine current and past problems with Evolution. In fact, the book is really better viewed as yet another examination of Evolution and its problems with no alternate hypothosis provided. The idea of Intelligent Design is constantly presented but never backed up with evidence, only assertions and hand waving.I had hoped that this was the book that would finally present Intellgient Design in the true scientific light as Evolution has been shown"
5,another great intelligent design book!,"The only bad review (nea-csec@juno.com) is found on nearly every ID/old-earth book! Obviously this person is part of the liberal young-earth cult whom are now downplaying ID (the only viable scientific and biblically sound theory alternative to macroevolution) because it doesn't support irrational young-earthism. For more great ID and biblical old-earth books see ""A New A Look at an Old Earth"", ""Creation and Time"", ""the genesis question,"" and ""show me god."""
1,Replaces A Small Mystery With An Even Bigger One,"Despite protests to the contrary, the authors are transparently trying to promote and ""legitimize"" a theological agenda under the guise of science. The theses of the contributors have already been debunked by several authors, most notably, physicist professor Victor J. Stenger. I strongly urge that his critiques of ID and those of other skeptics be consulted before spending money on and facilitating an intellectually dangerous and underhanded attempt to blow new wind into creationist sails."
3,Evolution and intelligent design are not mutually exclusive,"The one overriding flaw in the book is the assumption that evolution and intelligent design are mutually exclusive concepts. Cosmologically speaking, if we trace the origins of life by beginning with the origins of the universe as currently theorized by the best cosmologists, we cannot help but become aware of at least the possibility that the universe's aim all along was to create something that was aware of its existence. (Substitute God for universe, if you care to). Evolution then becomes an engine for the design."
3,A good start for jobs in the South,An excellent starting point for anyone that wishes to become a firefighter in the south. This book lists various cities from states such as Virgina all the way down to Georgia.It goes into a somewhat vague list of requirements for each city. There should be a bit of a clearer listing of the physical requirements for the test.Overall a good starting point.
4,Beautiful snowflakes with a few snips!,"I bought this book as a boredom buster for my kids, ages 8 and 6. It was perhaps a little too detailed for my 6 year old,(lots of tiny cuts that need pretty sharp scissors) but my 8 year old had few problems! Interestingly enough, it was myself and another pre-school teacher friend who had the best time working with this book. We copied the patterns so as not to destroy the originals in the book, and we commenced cutting! Needless to say, our winter bulletin board has the most beautiful snowflakes ever! I would say the book is best for the 10 and up crowd. It would make a great Sunday School craft/lesson, or 4th - 5th grade project. It is a teachers' best friend! Especially in conjunction with the book Snowflake Bentley. I will pull it out much earlier this winter, so we can have beautiful snowflakes adorning our windows in December. Our favorites- the ballerinas, the birds, and my 8 year old son loves the spiderweb snowflake!"
4,Fun project,"Really neat snowflakes to cut out but not for very young children. They take a lot of time and patience. If your child is really into sitting for a long period of time and slowly cutting tiny little sections of folded paper away, then this is the book for them. Every child is different so I won't suggest a specific age range. It really boils down to your childs interest and temperment. I will say it does require very sharp scissors. But nevertheless, a very fun project."
5,"Lively, revealing, and enthusiastically recommended","Vanilla is one of the most popular flavoring spices in the world and is even a major ingredient in perfumes, paint and tires, but the story of vanilla is a botanical mystery that only a twelve-year-old African slave solved. Vanilla would not bear fruit outside of its Mexican origins, until the slave developed a process for cultivating it and turned it into a labor-intensive agricultural crop. Lively, revealing, and enthusiastically recommended reading, Tim Ecott's Vanilla: Travels In Search Of The Ice Cream Orchid, should not be missed by any kitchen cook, gourmet diner, or botanist."
4,This Book is Available for list Price!,Great book as previous reviewers have stated. I particularly liked the suppressed LHO belongings photo that included a Minox spy camera. The after market prices seem very high. I just purchased mine (autographed) from the Sixth Floor Museum in Dallas for the list price of $25. They had at least 20 copies as of 9 Nov 2008.
2,Misleading information - read the fine print,"The tissue is advertised on Amazon as having a minimum of 80% post consumer recycled (P.C.R.) content. The product I received, however, states that while the box is 85% P.C.R., the tissue itself is only 20% P.C.R. This is pretty lame, I must say.Also, it doesn't come in the cool box displayed online with the green tree, but some strange 'cloudish' design that looks like it is from the 1980's or something.If 7th Gen. has changed the product, they should take the time to make sure that the resellers advertise with the most up to date info - shame on them."
1,"Yes, save the planet; no, to torture.","I am the organic, recycle poster queen...but alas, I am a princess....and these tissues are meant for prison inmates at best. I really wanted to like them, but I will NEVER purchase them again. I have banished the large carton quantity of these rough style tissues to my boys rooms and the basement to give them the rustic, in the woods, feel they so relish. I have gone back to perhaps not eco friendly, but definitely comfortable Puffs. When they incorporate comfort into the recycled product I will be the first in line. These tissues are really reminiscent of the Sears catalog days in the outhouse."
1,These are the roughest facial tissues ever!,"Please, saving trees is very important, but let's use recycled paper on things other than our poor noses! These tissues were like cardboard. I will never use them again."
2,Two points for trying....,"...but once you get a cold you will regret this purchase. It is super harsh, and noses get very sore. Will continue looking for a middle ground."
4,Almost There,"These tissues work just as well, and they're definitely better on the environment, than those from the big companies. But they could be quite a bit more environmentally friendly than they are, too - more post consumer content, less packaging."
1,they stink (literally),"The quality of these tissues is ok, but they are *scented*, even though the description says they are fragance-free. The fragance is reminiscent of a cheap perfume a tween might wear. Terrible to get a nose full of it everytime you need a tissue."
2,Tissues come out in wasteful clumps. Softness is fine.,"After using at least a seventy boxes of these I'm finally fed up with the experience of pulling tissues from the box. The first few and the last few almost always come out in clumps. It's a wasteful, annoying and unsatisfying experience. Who knew one could have a poor tissue-removing-from-a-box experience? It's unclear if this is a function of how Seventh Generation packages the tissues or the tissues themselves. I gave Seventh Generation feedback over this problem a few months ago since I generally like (and use) the company's products.The softness is fine - they are rougher than Kleenex, etc. but one gets used to it.Before committing to 36 boxes, I suggest trying a single box."
2,not satisfied,"I understand the importance of taking care of the environment, but is this the best they can do? First off, the tissues are poorly packaged, such that getting the first one out of the box is likely to tear it or pull several others out of the box. More significantly, these wipes feel like light grit sandpaper. There has to be better options. I can't help thinking that some of these earth-friendly companies like Seventh Generation profit from our environmental good will through their marketing."
2,Poor quality,The quality is just not there. It's difficult to pull the tissues out of the box. Every sheet tears attempting to pull them out of the box. The tissues are rough and thin. I need to use 2 tissues each time due to tearing and thinness. My biggest regret is that I bought a whole case of these things. Too many to trash. I may donate them.
4,Ordering my third case,"I am quite satisfied with these. Some others complain about getting the first tissue out. I have this problem too, but it's only the first tissue and if I am careful, from experience, they come out just fine thereafter. Because of allergies I have boxes all over the house. It's convenient to buy them in bulk. My nightmare would be running out of tissues.They are not as soft as Kleenex but I like them better. I no longer like the feel of Kleenex on the few occasions I use one elsewhere.I am also happy I can help the environment, even if in a tiny way."
2,I love being green but...,I'm a huge fan of this company but tissues that don't do their job is pointless. The product is too thin & u blow right thru the tissue.
5,From conquest to GULag - What a book!,"If you want to know about Siberia and its history, this is really the book to go for!You'll get a very clear picture of the Russian expantion to the East as well as the epiq stories of bold and daring people who made the first expeditions into this hostile and giant land. They were true heroes, although many of them became so much against their will and like so many other heroes, many of them never came back home.This is not another story about the camps in Siberia. The camps are described and Bobrick does that very well, but the true value of this book is the time before World War 1. Further, it is very well written and you'll loose your nights sleep, once you get started!Highly recommended!"
1,Can't Believe It Was Published !,"I can't believe this book got anything but pathetic reviews.The book wasn't particularly well written. The author spent more time ""telling"" her readers things about them, rather than ""showing"" us in a skillful way. The body of the novel was disjointed and confusing most of the time. She tried to use a vehicle she wasn't talented enough to handle properly.The hero was completely unsympathetic -- he was selfish, an admitted liar (to his ""beloved,"" no less), cruel, unfaithful, and out of control. I get that from the real world -- most of us want our heroes to be larger than life, embodying honorable qualities. This hero and heroine were more concerned with lust than love.I am generally a stickler for finishing a book, no matter how inferior I find it to be. This one, however, I had to force myself to finish, much like I force myself to take a foul medicine.If you cherish a well-written paranormal romance, this book is NOT for you."
5,Extremely well written,I absolutely loved this novel. It has been esquisitely written by an obvious master of the written word. Michele Hauf is one of the most talented women on Earth.
5,Will There Really Be A Morning?,"I had seen the motion picture several times but never read the book. As a behavioral health clinician, I find myself drawn to the ""real world"" that isn't seen by all. This book held my attention from beginning to end. It was absolutely heart-breaking to view through this woman's words how not only her parents, and of course the 1930's Hollywood, but last but not least the systems charged with caring for the mentally ill, could have treated her so inhumanely. This is to say, unless she could benefit them. Anyone in the field should read this."
5,a faceless sinner?,"Frances Farmers portrayl of her life in the book Will There Really be a morning is greatly moving. She clearly tells of her unjustly commitments to insane asylums. The detail provided is remarkable. She was rapped, beaten and drugged, yet somehow through all the turmoil frances remains alive. Declared insane, frances was given a lobotomy. Yet,somehow she miraculously is able to write an autobiography. Will there really be a morning, rumored to be ghost writen, brought tears to my eyes. This true story of a beautiful talented actress, unjustly accused of being insane, describes the cruel hollywood of the past and the irrational social values applied to women. Will there really be a morning, gives a fantastic portrait of a strong willed stubborn young women who was born at an unfortunate time."
5,Great phonics...,"Beck is the best at this. A super book, perfect if you want to teach anyone how to read."
4,A Worthwhile X-Men Game,"I Like this game a lot although the character selection of only 10 fighters (Cyclops, Wolverine, Psylocke, Iceman, Colossus, Storm, Spiral, Silver Samurai, Omega Red and A sleek version of a Sentinel to boot) is small. This is the first of a seemingly endless array of sequels for the Playstaton and Dreamcast systems. Nicely done graphics, music gets a little too heroic at times but the gameplay itself is almost flawless!! If you're a Street Fighter and X-Men fan, this game is a must!!! Note: To younger kids, this game is pretty difficult even on easy for someone less than 15..."
1,VERY Disappointing,"Very disappointing!! Offered no new information. Instead, basically retold the history of the Pacific war. Apart for a few minutes of sketchy underwater footage and stock pictures of the Yamato itself (that we've all seen before) this DVD offers nothing knew to the Yamato enthusiast!"
3,sinking the supership,"supership the yamato was,unfortunately i cannot say the same about this dvd.it had hardly any underwater film of the wreck,which i expected,but all you see is a minisub measuring the chrysanthemum crest on the great ships bow to authenticate the wreck; and they got that wrong too,the crest was/is 1.2 meters in dia,not 2 meters! a real dissapointment."
5,Terrific,"Lots of old time remedies, that is fascinating. The man was brilliant!I see how he became famous so fast. He was something so special"
3,Too far out there for me.,"I think some of the Cayce recommendations are valid, but most are just too far out there for me. Also, the way he diagnosed while he was under hypnosis just doesn't make sense to me. I can't think of a nicer way to put that."
1,Make Donkey Kong 64 look Really hard,"I think that this is simplely, the worse players guide I have ever bought and I don't think that this would be a good book to buy for yourself."
2,Not Highly Recommended,"This is not a neat, concise type of guide. Some guides are beautifully organized and highly informative--this one is not. I guess it's somewhat helpful but if you've got to pick one guide, go with the other ""official"" one by Brady, or, if it's different from Brady, the Nintendo one would be better for your money."
5,Best Book Out There,"Prima has out done itself this time. With all the maps as to where each Golden Banana is or where each Banana Fairy may be hiding, this book clearly tells all you need to know. With detailed guides and maps for each of the characters, this book is one of the most helpful that I have ever used."
1,Only a donkey would buy this guide.,"I simply can not believe Prima stays in business publishing guides of this ""quality."" It must be because you can't return the book once you've purchased it. That must be the explanation, because no other explanation makes sense. Stay away at all costs: buy the Nintendo guide."
1,prima's official strategy guide for Donkey Kong 64,this is the WORST book...hardest to understand... and downright confusing. The WORST strategy guide book I have ever purchased...People should be aware for the money and having to pay to return it..Thank-you
5,A Very Underated Western.,"William Holden and McDonald Carey are two gunslingers who save lady in distress Mona Freeman.Soon Bill and McDonald go their different ways,William is the good guy while MR Carey remains an outlaw.Mona,of course,is the object of the boys affection.Soon,Williams pal William Bendix is killed by McDonald setting William against McDonald.Needless to say,it comes to a showdown.After seeing this you will say,They dont make westerns like this anymore.Good Cast,Stanley Ridges,Alfonso Bedoya(Again,as in Treasure OF Sierra Madre,an evil villian)etcDir by Leslie Fenton"
3,The taste is OK and the price is right,"Well, it doesn't get much better than this down at the dollar-a-can level. I was actually able to eat a can of these cold, which says a lot. There were four medium size fish in the can. They had a mild taste which balanced well with the mild but still assertive mustard sauce. After trying some of the other really ""cost effective"" brands of sardines, I expected the worst, and I was pleasantly surprised."
4,Delicious faux memoir,"Delightful fictional memoir that pokes fun at the newly emerged international jet set and the idle rich in general. Princess Tulip is a poseur risen from lowly origins who marries up and falls in with ""the International Set."" Outrageously expensive outfits, far too many cocktails, a cast of colorful characters, and spectacular hi-jinks ensue.This is a rare out-of-print gem that is worth tracking down if you enjoy the bubbly comic novels of the 1920's-1950's (e.g. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Auntie Mame, Topper, etc.)."
2,oh good Lord....,"I must be incredibly sensitive, but this hurt like the dickens! I honestly just had to throw it out. I couldn't in good conscience even give it away to someone."
