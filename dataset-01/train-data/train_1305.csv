2,"Either doesn't last long, or doesn't work","I've sprayed it a few times and it doesn't seem to stop them from messing with what I've sprayed. It does stink, but apparently only to me."
1,did not work,"Short and simple: this did not repel my cat. I sprayed the product heavily on the item I did not want the cat on, and it had no deterrent effect at all! Sorry, that was my experience. Don't waste your money."
2,Did not work for my cat....,"It worked for about a week, but then it just didn't bother my kitten anymore. Maybe it will work for older cats."
1,Might as well have used water,I bought this product because the cat kept going next door and the lady next door complained. I couldn't have the cat inside because I had a family member staying with me for a bit that was allergic to cats.So I bought this to keep the cat out of her yard.It had no effect what so ever. In fact the cat followed me around as I sprayed it.She smelled it and it was like nothing. She kept following me.I found this a total waste of money.The seller was great but the product was useless.It didn't even work for hour. My cat still goes over there.But the neighbor knows I tried.
1,Do NOT use in your house,"I don't know how to be delicate and polite about this, but this stuff smells like burning tires. Do not under any circumstances use this product in your house. It will keep your cats away, sure, but it will keep you away too. I used this product and about five minutes later started gagging because of the smell. It is going right into the trash. I will be going back to using the very effective, smell-free (though slightly more expensive) Feliway."
1,This Stuff is SCARY!,"When I received this product and read the label on the back, I knew I would never use it. The statement ""Hazard to Humans and Domestic Animals"" (their words) was enough to frighten me off. I simply want to keep my cats from clawing the furniture. I looked up the active ingridients on the EPA site, and while they were listed as the lowest level of toxicity, the fact that they were at all toxic was enough to insure I would not use this product. I may be over-reacting but there are non-toxic repellents out there. I should have done my homework."
2,THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS MOOSE PAST!,"My rating is two stars, but that's not to say it isn't worth watching. While the film has some serious flaws, it does have creepy atmosphere and a few good scares. The reason for my low rating it that I felt this story was too long and it has an unfulfilling ending although it stays with you, I wasn't satisfied with the ending. It leaves way too much to ones interpretation.The cast is OK, but you care little for most of these people and there are a lot of things that don't make much sense. It is still something that horror fans should at least take a look at as it does deliver some pretty good chills...something seriously missing from horror films today."
1,Completely stupid movie !,"Save your time and money, do something else than buying or even rent this movie. Pure waste of time. Why can't we give zero star, because this one really deserve it."
1,ZZZZZZZ,"Well, with a somewhat recognizable actor, I thought this would be a scare. I waited for 2/3 of the movie to finish just to get even a ""Boo"". It's apparent the movie is using the usual liberal-Hollywood-loony-leftist hype that man and the evil oil companies are killing mother earth with Global warming. Unleashing the prehistoric wrath of an ancient mother earth protecting/killing ghost. Barf. A waste of electricity folks. It's as if the director is another liberal Hollywood weenie trying to imbibe the worlds simple minded E! entertainment gazing folk with more stuff that is ""Scary"" with a 'caugh', global warming theme. Note: NOT scary."
1,Just a pure piece of ......,This is an hour and fourty minutes of my life I will never get back. To think of what I else I could have done during this time......
2,Scarily bad,"I'm having a hard time deciding what I like least about this film. I'm torn between the horrible acting (Ron Pearlman...he must have needed the paycheck but he just phoned this one in), the quasi-scientific babble, or the rediculous ghostly manifestations of the Earth spirit.I'm not going to politicize the film like some others, although the elements of global warming alarmists and anti-drilling activists are easily deciphered. These things were used as a backdrop, not a statement. Ultimately this was intended to be a horror movie, but it fell completely flat.For a genuinely great horror film about people isolated in a frozen wasteland confronting an ancient evil, watch The Thing. This film should be buried under the ice and forgotten as quickly as possible."
1,oh no! i might get killed by a giant ghost moose who wants revenge for being in our gas tanks.,"really? ""scariest movie of the year""!? ""far scarier than the dungeons of saw""!? the only people frightened by a big giant ghost moose who is mad about global warming are environmentalists. i guess in the apocalypse a BIG GIANT GHOST MOOSE IS GOING TO KILL US ALL. the DVD also features a making-of feature that is as long as the movie and explains how they GOT THE IDEA FOR THE GIANT GHOST MOOSE and HOW THEY MADE THE GIANT GHOST MOOSE. and i'm not sorry for spoiling the part about the FU*KING GIANT GHOST MOOSE."
1,Condescending Garbage.,"Mother earth is mad at us and now she is fighting back. And to think that she does it in such a creepy way. PU-LEEZE! It's The Shining for the tree-hugging crowd. And just like their logic on global warming, their logic in film making is flawed as well. Do yourself a favor and save your money on this clunker.Better yet, I will help you recreate the entire movie right now in the comfort of your own home.Step (1) Turn the air conditioner really low if it is hot outside or turn the heat off if it is cold where you are. In other words: GET THE HOUSE REALLY COLD.Step (2) Place Al Gore's book against your chest using your right hand. If you don't have it then any of the following will work as well. Cosmo, Star Magazine, People, National Enquirer, etc.Step (3) Flash the lights with your left hand and make howling sounds. Then cry real tears.THERE YOU GO! THAT'S IT! That's what you missed. Glad to be of service."
2,"Who said this movie was ""scary""?","I am truly dissapointed. I bought this movie because some lying folks said it was real scary and this is not true.The movie is not bad definetely, if we consider the atmosphere it gives and the solid actings, however, turns out to be an ecological film with some poor graphics (the windigo????) and no scares at all!!!!So, it's easy to see the ambience of The Thing and the sense of The Happening, at the end it looks like the zombie movies opening...."
4,Let's balance the reviews,"Some people obviously were offended by the political content and didn't get this movie, but if you like horror flicks, this is one of the better ones of the last few years. I totally agree with the last review, never mind all the global warming, nature is out to get us stuff, that's just context, you don't have to buy into that at all (though the theme gets really fun in the end). Since when is any background setup realistic for a horror movie anyway? This is a classic slow burn freaky deaky flick, just lay back and enjoy the ride, I did."
2,Not What I Expected,"The info about this movie that I have seen online and from the packaging leads you to believe it's a true horror movie ""The Scariest Movie of the Year"" and it's not! It's more of a cautionary tale about global warming with a few frozen stiffs thrown in. I was not impressed at all. The acting was wooden (or maybe frozen)and the plot was, to be blunt, incredibly dumb. Spoiler Alert - the big bad is nature fighting back against man. A noble idea for a plot perhaps but badly executed in this case."
3,Good To Watch At First...But What Happened?,"I have to admit, I was intriqued at first. The jargon was good. I was hooked, and how the actors played their part, I was digging it. There was the normal scientific talk, you know, global warming, figures and numbers, important meetings at the top of the world to discuss America becoming oil independepent....but then all of a sudden it got very unscientific and changed to weird.I was wondering what in the world the boy was seeing, and eventually my question was asked. And then when I got to the ending, I was like...huh, I know they weren't finished..but they were. Maybe, the movie makers were trying to rush to get finished before a set time or something.Honestly, the movie turned out to be disappointing for me, and I thought maybe it should have stayed scientific or stayed weird, not both. It just didn't come together well for me at all.Thanks."
1,stop French intelectuals before it is to late.,"Allthough a classic, the style was horrible. Even for somebody whose mothertongue is english, this book must be difficult to read. Why is it that French intelectuals think they have to explain everything as difficult as possible. I finished because I was on an Island with nothing else to read, but it didn't teach me much about the cast system. Not because the information is not in te book, but because it was burried under to many, not relevant information, and written in a hard to follow style.Try another book."
3,pretty good,"This is a pretty good bag for a purse, hiking bag, picnic bag but I wouldn't recommend using it on long treks or in harsh conditions. It is very adjustable, and there is a loop in the back so that you can wear the shoulderstrap as a belt and wear the bag like a butt pack. The paint will flake off the buckles/fasteners after a very short time, which is a little scary because who knows where that paint is from (China? eek!). It is styled after a German Army bread bag, but the product itself is made in India. This would make a nice ""man purse"" if you like that particular metrosexual trend but still want to retain some of your tough-guy image. It's probably cheaper to head down to your local Army/Navy surplus store and pick up a real surplus German Army bread bag (they usually sell for around $3 in used condition). This bag is a little plain and would look great decked out with the buttons, patches, or stencils of your choice."
2,"Had promise, then ""popped""","I got her EP as a special from Wind-Up, and after her tracks on Elektra and Fantastic Four, wanted more. The EP rocks. Then apparently she was being creativly pushed in a direction she didn't want to go, so delayed the album to ""fix it"". Well as some have noted, it is a bit bipolar. The tracks that are the best are from the EP, the others, while not bad, have an absolutely different feel, much like a nauseating sharp turn on a bad roller coaster.And to boot, during a rough time in my life, she was incredibly rude to me, taking no responsibility for her image or actions. So if I ever buy her stuff, it will be secondhand. I feel no compulsion for her to make a dime off of me."
5,Excellent Album,"I first heard of Megan McCauley through her song Wonder, an absolutely fantastic song, on the Elektra soundtrack. Wonder also appears on this album along with several other great songs. Most of the album has a hard core Blues type sound. You can hear a more melodic, smoother Janis Joplin influence. And then you get to Tap That. Tap That, a bubbly pop song, is completely out of character with the rest of the songs on the album. Unfortunately, it gets stuck in your head and you regretfully find yourself finally liking the song - at least I did. Megan McCauley has a powerful voice and uses her music to deal with a turbulent home life. There is a fair amount of profanity in several of the songs. This is an insanely good debut album and is definitely worth a listen."
1,if it seems too good to be true it usually is,i got this cd for just when i needed you most and thought wow what a deal 36 songs nice cd graphics everything but as the other reviewer has said it simply sucked i thought a few gems on here were pretty good but re recordings i want the original versions man!!!! just when i needed you most sounded like a honky tonk bar version nothing wrong with honky tonk but this is not a honky tonk song also rare earth song sounded like it was played but someone just learning the guitar.yuck avoid this
1,Flashback of the 70's: 36 Great Pop Hits,There were a couple of hard to find hits on it that justified the 1 star - however 90% of the songs were re-recordings. And we all know that there is nothing worse than that. Skip It.
4,flexible,"From the picture it looks like this item would be very hard and uncomfortable, but it actually is both solid and flexible, which makes it very comfortable to use. The strap is made from rather cheap materials that look to be hard to keep clean and sanitize, so I haven't used it. I especially like how the end is easy to hold on to, even when lubricated. Oh, and it does have that strong rubber smell."
2,"Look fine, texture OK, smell *awful*","I haven't bought many such toys before, so I didn't want to spend too much unnecessarily. When I opened this one, I could tell immediately why people spend the extra money. The smell was extremely unappetizing, and wouldn't wash off. I've read a number of conflicting suggestions about what to do, but I don't hold out much hope."
3,Not bad,"...but not great. The convenience is great for camping, but there's no special advantage in having the fillets over the regular style."
5,Very Good Fillets,"if you like fish but not sure what kind of fish you like, i really enjoyed these Del Monte Starkist Tuna Fillets, i am sure i will buy more sometime in the future."
4,"Super cute, funny, and a bit overpriced",This is a cute doll. What can you say- it's so ugly that it's cute. No complaints except that it is pretty expensive for what it is. Cute gift for kids and adults with a sense of humor.
4,Grandson's Request,Purchased this for my grandson's birthday at his request. Well constructed and very unique. Very soft. I hope he will be pleased.
3,Cute but definetley over priced for what it is,"So simple. I felt like a fool after opening the package. I don't know how to sew but this pattern and design would've been a beginners success. Oh well, my daughter loves it and thats all that truley matters. Much smaller than anticipated. I would have to say someone is making a killing on the Ugly Doll lineup."
3,Ugly doll Icebat,"I got this icebat for my wife as a Christmas present. She always wanted to have an ugly doll and this is her first one. She loves her icebat and thinks it is the cutest thing in the world. I personally think it is a little expensive for what you get.... But it made my wife happy, so I'm happy with what I got.I wish it was smaller. It was bigger than expected.... Maybe cyz I had never seen one before.I don't like the materials the used to make this toy, but my wife says is part of the ugly doll phylosophy.... To use materials that look like they have already been used before."
3,UGLY INDEED,"All three of my daughters have wanted these UGLY DOLLS for some time. They're really so simply, I was tempted to make them myself. But I knew it just wouldn't be the same. This year I finally gave in and got one for each of them. They all were very excited to receive them. Really, they're kind of like a stuffed animal/pillow combo. The quality seems good enough. I guess time will tell how well them hold up."
2,great lumbar pillow,"When my daughter, almost 2 at the time, unwrapped this Christmas morning, she said ""I don't like it!"" She was horrified by the thing. It is truly that alarming to little people. The adults find it charming. My husband found that it made a perfect lumbar pillow when watching television. Enough so that I'm replacing the original one that the dogs chewed up with a new one to use as a lumbar pillow. Our daughter, almost 4 now, still has no interest in playing with the thing and thinks of it as Daddy's pillow."
5,THE BEST!,Ugly Dolls are the best! They are well made and truly unique. Everyone should have one. I buy them for everyone as gifts. And I have a collection of them myself.
5,OX - My Favorite New Friend,"I received OX as a Christmas gift and have since fallen in love with this series of stuffed companions. The material is very soft and not at all ugly, despite the makers' statement that these dolls are made from the ""ugliest materials"" they could find. In addition to being soft, OX is adorable, especially his dossier. He truly has taken over all of my possessions. But he is good at sharing so I am not complaining. And he does give many hugs with his ears, since his arms are a bit too short. Earhugs are definitely fun.OX comes with a small card describing him in detail. For those who decide they like Uglydolls, I recommend a visit to the official website for a peek at their T-shirts and the 7 inch dolls. The smaller versions are different colors than the larger ones.J.H. Sweet, author of The Fairy Chronicles, and Uglydolls collector"
5,Nice Addition to My Uglydolls Collection,"I truly love this set of stuffed friends. The material Icebat is made from is very soft and not at all ugly, despite the makers' statement that these dolls are made from the ""ugliest materials"" they could find.Icebat is fitting in nicely with OX, Cinko, and Uglydog, and with the bat fairies, Brandtii and Oreo, who sometimes visit me. He comes with a small card describing him in detail. (His dossier is very cute.) For those who decide they like these dolls, I recommend a visit to the official Uglydolls website for a peek at their T-shirts and the 7 inch dolls. The smaller versions are different colors than the larger ones.J.H. Sweet, author of The Fairy Chronicles, and Uglydolls collector"
5,Ice Bat melted my 5 year old son's heart!,"On the day that this toy arrived, there are few words to say other than, ""Mommy my Ice Bat is here!"" And this toy has not left my son's bed since. He adores it. It's so ugly it's cute...or as we put it warthog cute. My son spotted it on Amazon while I was searching for a gift and that was it. ""Mom, can I have that?"" Now please understand that my kid doesn't ask for anything..until Ice Bat. Ice Bat sleeps in his bed every night and when he's sick this flat bat has to snuggle down with him. He adores it. And I have come to love it too. They are flat, fleece and with the reaction my kid had to its arrival...worth every penny!"
4,Cool Cool Turny Burny,Kids love this Ugly Doll. It is so cute and loveable.Ugly Dolls are durable and hold up to kid's abuse.NOTE that Turny Burny is one doll -- not two. The photo shows both sides of the doll.
4,Ugly Dolls Need Love Too...,"I purchased this Ugly Doll as a Christmas gift for my 5 yr old daughter. She thinks it's fun, and likes his ""Goofy"" expresssion. The Ugly Dolls are made with a fleece type fabric, are soft filled making them super nice to hug, or even use as a pillow during a long car trip. My older ""tween"" also loves the Ugly Dolls, and enjoys collecting them. Good gift for ALL ages. Everyone needs love...even an UGLY DOLL. Ugly Dolls so ugly..they're CUTE!!"
5,"Cuddly, Soft, Well-made & Collectible","Cuddly, Soft, Well-made & Highly Collectible. My children draw these figures and make cartoon episodes out of them. They're adorable and pillow-like."
2,Ugly color,"My grandson asked for this toy, but thought it looked lime green. It was an awful pea green, smaller than it appeared on the ad."
5,Wonderful!,"Ok, I can't say it enough. These are really awesome and boys and girls like them. They all have their own personality which is included in their tag when purchased. Regular size makes a great travel pillow-that's my excuse for having one, lol."
1,Highly Disappointed,"This is NOT the original music from my teen experience. The reason we purchace ""Oldies Tunes"" is for the FEELINGS we experience while listening to the ""Hits"" of our time. I never buy an album from any on-line store if the artists' names are not typed in next to each song...that USUALLY means it is really the same song I expect it to be. But, THIS cd actually had the original artists' names there, but none of the songs were the same as the originals.....I have no use for FAKE music. My collection of Oldies is still missing certain songs and artists, which I will eventually find, but, This cd Was Not Worth The Trouble Of Listening To It....much less having to repack and return it."
5,Another side of Aly & AJ,"Aly & AJ have made it clear that they are deeply religious. Up to now, their songs did not reflect their spiritual side. The album starts with an upbeat original ""Greatest Time of Year"", but it is ""Joy To The World"", ""We Three Kings"", and ""The First Noel"" that sung, simply and clearly, reflect their love for Jesus Christ and the purpose of the album. Their sincerity is evident. The last song, another original, ""Not This Year"" is somber and acknowledges the fact that it is all right not to feel joyous during the holiday season; the complete opposite of the first song. Overall, I am impressed by Aly & AJ's restraint in tinkering with the classics."
4,A Pretty Good CD,"i liked it alot, i love their songs. the only thing i would change is maybe mix the song topics up a bit, they see to all be about the same thing, perhapes if they chose some original topics..........? still very good though"
4,Bryan is back!,"The album is great! I am so glad Bryan Adams is back! If you love songs like ""Heaven"", you will like this album. It is so nice and simple, but wonderful. I recommend this album for all Bryan fans."
5,THE BEST SINGER BRYAN ADAMS,I have been a huge fan of Bryan Adams as far as I can remember. He is the best singer out there from the 80's yet i only have 2 cd's of his plus a soundtrack he did. But I definetly think his Room Service cd is the best yet.thanks Ann
1,time to hang it up,"Bryan Adams was cool during the ""Reckless"" Era,but His Material has steadily gone down&just settled for middle of the road material.Bryan Adams been trying to re-capture the magic of his past&trying to re-click on his past blue-Print,but the songs ain't there&His Music is so generic&Lifeless these days.He was cool back in the day."
3,Bryan Adams Fans deserve more,"Don't get me wrong, i like the cd, (I liked On a day like today a lot more), but it's been over six years since his last album (i'm not considering ""Stallion"") and he records 11 songs in an album that runs for only 36 minutes!!,give me a break!!.Putting that aside, the album is good, kind of a mix between 18 til i die and waking up.... The best songs are: east side story and room service."
5,Room Service- well worth the wait!!!!!!!!!!,"It's been a long time coming, but finally, finally, a new CD from our very own bad boy. This CD is one of my favorites, it combines the rock tunes you love to sing along with, and the ballads that make you think. I would recommend any Bryan Adams fan to purchase this CD, money well spent! And to any new fans, this is a great start for you!!! Bryan Adams is the most talented singer/songwriter! ROOM SERVICE ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Laid back music,"The songs on this album are more laid back sounding. I think it's because his band is still a trio w/ only guitar, bass, and drums. Gone are the slick keyboard melodies and extra dimensions from other instruments he used in the past (violin, flute, etc). I wish he would bring back the keyboard, but the songs are now simpler, even if the meanings are deeper."
5,Love it!,"This CD is great. I am still in the process of getting to ""know"" the songs, but so far I love it. My favorite, by far, is ""Flying"". It's the best ballad he's written in years, and is dangerously close to be coming my favorite song ever. ""Open Road"", ""East Side Story"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"" are among my favorites also. (I bought my copy from the UK amazon in order to get the bonus track, ""Blessings in Disguise"", which is a very cool swing song.)A must-have!!"
4,Grows on you,"First of all, I have to warn: I love Bryan Adams' music. Still, it took me a long while to get this album. The first time i heard all the songs, only one stood out - 'Eastside story'. Its a fabulous, eternal song that everyone - and I mean everyone - can identify with. Then I had to listen a few more times and I started to like 'Not Romeo, not Juliet' and 'So hard to love'. They are lovely everyday songs thats so BA's style, but so unique no matter how many others of his you have listened to. There is one other song that is special to me 'I was only dreaming'. Thats a haunting, soft song that takes hold of your thoughts for entire days at a time. The only thing that I noticed is that somehow all the songs are short, but it doesnt matter when you are a fan, does it? :)"
5,Urbanwolf's Room Service Review,This album is one of Bryan's greatest. The songs are wonderfully written and the music is awesome. I highly recommend this album to everyone.
5,A great album!,This a a great album to listen to anytime. His vocals are absolutely amazing and I love to just listen to his voice. It is one of my favorites!
5,Room Service,"Bryan Adams new CD, Room Service is very good. ""This side of Paradise"" is an awesome song, it has a great beat to it.It also has a great story line to it. ""Right back where I started from"" and "" Room Service"" are songs that prove that Bryan Adams still got what it takes to write wonderful songs. You will not be at all disappointed, I give this CD 5 stars."
5,Amazing!,"I'm totally speechless!The album is just amazing, totally great..I think it's one of the best albums BA made!"
5,The Second Amendment,"This book helps make clear the assault on our constitution especially by our governments, state & especially the federal. When you read the founders own words and reasoning behind the 2nd Amendment you will appreciate it. Arms for hunting and personal protection were a given and were not even close to the reasoning behind this amendment."
5,Thoroughly enlightening,This is a must-have for every American. The details and sourcing are amazing. Taken from the original words and clearly defined
5,Big Lie Revealed,This tiny little book showcases the biggest lie ever perpetrated on the American public. I recommend the few minutes it takes to read it to every single American old enough to read!!
5,Everybody should KNOW this!,This should be required learning for every person living in the USA. The current government wants this amendment to disappear.
5,Best Book on 2nd Amendment out there.,Short. Precise & to the point. Chocked full of quotes and truly builds the historical picure surrounding our Second Amendment. If you want to understand this right and its historical context this is the book for you. If you want to know what the framers of our Constitution really meant... this is the book for you.
5,Second Amendment,This little book is full of great information pertaining to OUR rights as gun owners. I feel that even gun haters should read this book.
2,Slanted,I was hoping it would be an unbiased assessment of the second amendment. It's obviously infused with pro-gun and religious inclinations.
1,Barely a book,"This ""book"" is a 4x6 60-page pamphlet. Not at all worth the price. Spend your money on an actual book"
1,I should make a WMD to protect my myself against a government that WE created??,"Really? Could we use try different points of view for once. You would think that after twenty or thirty years or so we would have seen some positive results in this country. The Author should have had the "" book"" read back to him maybe he could have saved all of the wasted paper. If you think about it, the USA has pioneered some of the most dangerous WMD on the planet. Our arsenal is filled with instruments to end civilization. If you follow the logic of these ""patriot"" constitution twisting people who can't think of anything else but to brandish guns. Then we should acquire nuclear, chemical and biological weapons in order to defend ourselves against the tyrannical govement that WE THE PEOPLE elected and created. Think for your self for once."
1,Review for CSI 1-8,"I received this product defective. I contacted the seller for ways to refund the item or get it switched. She (amanda989) told me I had to send it to China, which was not specified in her returns policy. I informed her of that and she told me to send it back to her and she'll even test the next one she gives me. I told her okay, but I wanted one made in the USA and not some cheap copy from China. She sent me her address and never told me what she would be sending back to me. Who wants an opened/tested item when you can get it brand new from amazon? I emailed her 2 more times requesting what she would send me, but she ignored me. I had horrible customer service so I was forced to file a claim through amazon. I wouldn't recommend the seller to anyone."
3,Un fan en español¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡,"Para los amigos que esperan una critica en español, bueno, acá les va una.Como fan de Newsboys que he seguido su trayectoria desde su inicio, dejame decirte que este es un disco del cual si a ti te gustan los aeróbicos, acá encontraras unas canciones que pueden servirte para tus ejercicios, tenemos ""Wherever we go"", Let It All Come Out"", especialmente ""The Mission"" y ""City to City"". Las demas en mi opinión estan bien en cuanto a tener nuevos temas pero no me parecen exuberantes.El album no puede faltar en tu colección si eres un verdadero fan de Newsboys, con mucha onestidad lo catalogo de regular a bueno."
4,Scott gives French Socialism a Human Face,"Q: Socialism in the face of rapid industrialization?How can a student of the 19th century world come to appreciate the human qualities of such a struggle? The answers given by most historians are far too simple, a point which Joan Scott brings to light through her highly analytical, and yet delightfully readable account of the history of one French city. Her comparative analysis of the many significant, subtle cross-currents finally makes the conflict between Socialism and Industrial-Age progress clearly understandable."
5,Essential For Advanced Development,"Most ColdFusion books don't go beyond the basics, so they don't encourage CFers to think like ""real"" programmers. This one does.If you're building simple sites that don't have to support a lot of users, you probably don't need this book (except for cfhttp, which really should have been in the first volume of this set). Most of the information in the book isn't all that useful for everday CF tasks, but when you do need to go beyond the basics, you'll need to understand this stuff.As the title points out, this is for ""advanced"" development. If you want to harness the full power of ColdFusion and do things the ""right"" way, buy this book."
2,One of Thompson's weakest published works,"After an introduction of a great set of characters and a different than usual location for thompson, this book never gets off the gound"
3,Beautiful illustrations but. . .,I really like this illustrator so I basically bought this to add to my collection. Since this is literally a picture book (no words at all) if you are good at encouraging your child to formulate her own story this could work well as a magical journey you take together. If you're not good at making up stories you might not like this book.
3,This is Marge Schott speaking,"I hate you all. I hate everyone. My heart is black, and pumps blood made of coal."
5,Love those Post-Its!,Nothing like a Post-It note to keep you organized. So what can be better than a Pop-up Notes dispenser. This handy thing fits perfectly on my desk and easy to load. Excellent quality.
3,not worth the price!,"It's handy, yes, but for this price you can get a lot of ""free floating"" sticky notes without the organizer. As far as I am concerned, the money was not well spent!"
5,Wow!,I was a little nervous about ordering this thinking that it seemed a little too good to be true. After reading other reviews I decided to order it anways. I'm glad I did! I LOVE post-its and this purchase was well worth the money. A truly great value!
5,Must have,"It sounds funny, but this is one of my favorite office products. I had one at my old job, but my new employer is pretty stingy on office supplies, so I ended up buying one with my own money to have one! The dispenser is weighted and heavy so it doesn't come flying up when you remove a note, and is easy to refill. Lastly, you get lots of extra goodies with it, like flags, extra post it notes and a pad. Amazon sells this product cheaper than any office supply store I found. Why pay more for the same thing??"
5,Excellent basics!,"Just great basic information in a relatively brief pamphlet. I only grow a few tomato plants each year, but this has made me braver, and my results so far are good!"
3,Content poor and not good explained,"The content of this book looks a bit childish. If someone is learning English, this always means textbooks with childish contents. I thought the ""Business English Books"" would be different, but it is almost the same. However, the excersices are not really helpfull, the audio cd is good."
3,"Interesting, but.....","I own I, II, & III. I enjoyed learning about the unique design characteristics of nature and animals which lead to the conclusion that evolution doesn't have all the answers. However I was put off by the constant ridiculing by Dr. Jobe Martin of darwinist and evolutionist. I would like to show these DVDs to friends who are undecided on this issue but feel they would grow tired of his constant hammering against evolution. I don't mind facts being presented to build a case, but there is a tinge of sarcasm that comes through when Dr. Martin says ""you tell me, how did that evolve?"" It's not that I don't agree, it's just hearing it over and over and over and over....."
3,"Cool biology, but ""defy evolution""? I think not","Believing in evolution (as I do) caused me to watch this movie. I have been looking for anything in ""creation science"" that resembles ""science"" for some time now and am sad to report still have not found it. There are a lot of very cool animals in this movie that can do some very cool things. That was the part of the movie I enjoyed. The narrator going ""Well how could that have evolved?"" and me yelling at the screen ""Like this you idiot!!!"" was the part I did not. If you want to believe that God created the world and all the animals that's fine by me, but trying to convince someone by saying ""Well I don't see how that could have evolved"" that God created all the animals is preying on the weak minded...if you'll pardon the pun."
1,"Garbage, lies and brainwashing.","Each and every animal in this film has an evolutionary history richly understood by modern science, and every ""argument"" it levels against evolution is very simply a lie. They did no real research, they invent many names and they gloss over a staggering number of proven facts to fabricate points against the observable, undeniable realities of evolution, a beautiful process demonstrated by the entire natural world without a hitch, if you just care to look beyond the veil these people want to pull over your eyes.Exposing children to this is tantamount to psychological abuse and a malicious stifling of their developing curiosity."
1,Ralloh,"What I'm seeing is the same old thing. If it can't be explained, ""yet"", it must have been created by some supreme being. That just doesn't cut it. That is what's called blind faith. I could ask you, where did your god come from? You would say, he was always here. You could ask me, where did the original matter that makes up everything come from? I could say, it was always here. Stalemate. No proof of any of it.If there is a god who made everything and is all wise and knowing, answer this one for me. Why in the world would he put a gland in a man's body surrounding the urinary tract so that when you got older and it enlarged, it would pinch off the smooth flow of urine? To me that is a really stupid design. Of course you would come back with, god works in mysterious ways, or, he does this to test us. Hmmm, again, blind faith with no proof. This series, Incredible Creatures That Defy Evolution, is loaded with that."
1,Almost comical in it's simplistic attempt to debunk evolution.,"What is this, some kind of a joke? I thought this might be interesting but the examples used have been explained many times before in science journals. To argue against a subject, first you must understand it. The dentist who is trying to debunk evolution clearly does not understand the subject and is relying on you knowing even less.His argument is basically that if scientists can't explain every step, in detail, of how evolution occurs then the explanation defaults to a creator. Then, of course, the creator is the one he believes in.""I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours."" - Stephen Roberts"
1,AWESOME SAUCE,"This was the best documentary ever. I learned more about weird animals from this documentary than any animal planet show ever. I also laughed so hard I almost peed. The Scientists name is Jobe, and he converted from evolutionary thinking to creationist thinking because someone told him that animals are really strange. This should be listed as comedy, do not watch this with a closed mind, keep your mind open so that the hilarity can pour right in. Learn true things about giraffes and duck billed platapi that you never knew before and marvel at the poor use of English."
1,"An ""expert"" who isn't an expert","From the very beginning, the ""expert"" in this film demonstrates that he has no clue how evolution works.He is a dentist with a seemingly inadequate background in genetics and evolutionary biology.It's a pseudo-scientific documentary espousing the same theme as irreducible complexity, something that has already been debunked.Overall message of the documentary:""If you don't know, right now, precisely how something happened, god must've done it"""
1,Misconceptions galore,"What the writers of this piece of religious propoganda do not seem to get, is that Evolutionary Natural Selection IS an INTELLIGENT DESIGNER. Natural selection as explained by Darwin is a NON-RANDOM selective process that allows change in directions that produce a more fit organism, and discourages (by death) change in non fit directions. This film does BEAUTIFULLY illustrate how lacking in understanding, of the most basic high-school level evolutionary concepts, these religious propogandists are. READ YOUR KID'S HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGY BOOK, the you won't have to spend a small fortune making a movie highlighting your misconception!"
1,Lacks a basic understanding of evolution,There was nothing in this movie that a person with the most basic education in evolution could not see the holes in.
3,BRIEF - LIKE THE 1968 CAMPAIGN,"Although this book is well written, it does leave the reader wanting more.Dooley writes in a clear, crisp manner and will certainly hold his readers' collective attention. He plainly cared about Robert Kennedy and treats him with respect.This book covers the 1968 campaign when Robert Kennedy, then a senator ran for the presidential election. The best part of this book was the way the late Senator's supporters mobilized and are described in detail based on the groups they represented, e.g. ethnic groups, political groups, youth, etc.Readers who encounter this book do come away with the feeling that the late Senator certainly did care about people and was sincere in his efforts. His desire to share his vision of a more unified nation, to blend barriers of divisions are covered. Again, this as with any book on Robert Kennedy, one comes away with the questions of what would have transpired had this one good man not been assassinated in 1968."
2,A guide to the differences between men and women? Whatever.,"This book definately has some entertainment value, but I don't think that is why people are reading it. Hello people! If you're going to believe an author because she wrote a book, you need some help. Did anyone take the time to look at her sources? Cosmopolitan, People, Good Housekeeping...these are just a few. There is very little research to back any of the assertions that are made in this book. Yes, the book does make some valid points, but stop trying to break the world into strictly masculine and feminine. After reading this book I felt like I fit more of the characteristics of a man than a woman. Whatever you (the readers) do...please do not take this book to heart. There's little support, and keep in mind that the author is not conducting actual experiments or observations to validate the points. This book gives all of us that actually research psychological issues a bad name."
5,I wish I'd bought this book a year ago.,"This book was sent to me by a dear friend one week before my surgery. It only confirmed that surgery was the right option for me; however, I would recommend it even if surgery is not your choice. I found it to be comforting at a time when resources and answers to my questions were highly conflicting. Thanks to Ms. Barber for having the vision to write a much needed guide!"
2,Woman to Woman,"This book read well, but after a short time I was weary of listening to this woman whine on and on and on. The useful information she did give in the book could have been condensed to a booklet. It is now four weeks after my surgery and I cannot compare myself to her as I am doing wonderfully well. The spinal was a great way to go and the binder she mentions is worthwhile. Otherwise, this woman just whines - and I experienced years of heavy bleeding just as bad as she."
5,A diary of one woman's operation and recovery,"This is not a medical text, but a honest, frank journal by a woman who chose to have a hysterectomy to enhance her life. This is the only book I found that describes in a layperson's language what to expect in the weeks after surgery. I highly recommend it for any woman considering this operation."
1,A waste of good money....,A piece of junk. I ended up buying a Sony after this purchase which I have owned for years and has been more durable and reliable. The sound from the speakers never could get loud enough. There were other issues. Do you research first.
3,"very low-impact, yet excellent work out","This video takes ballet moves and structures them into a wonderful work out. It is a must for ex-dancers who want to get back into shape, but don't enjoy normal aerobics. I was very impressed."
2,kind of blah,My son does not care for this CD it is more for older kids I would say 8 and up who already speak spanish becuse to learn the language and think you are learning songs it is not the case with this CD. There are spanish tongue twisters and other story type sayings. It is also more of a castellano spanish. It is kind of bland for my taste and as i said even my baby did not care for it.
1,Not Good,"Fast shipping, recieved it within a week. Product did not work though. Emailed the company/seller and told them I would like a refund and they refunded me all of the money which is a plus."
3,The Mouse From a Book now in a TV Movie,"Hey kids! This 1986 television special, which was based on a best-selling novel, and also had two following movies: Ralph S. Mouse(1987) and Runaway Ralph(1988), also based on novels, is a great film. The animation is kind of cheap, but it is funny in most of it, and is a great family story. Talk your parents into getting it along with the other 2. You'll luv 'em!"
4,"If you like the book, I highly recommend this movie","I read this book to my 3rd grade class this year. After reading the book, we watched this video.The Good: My class really loved this movie! They laughed at parts, and compared it to the book. During most of the movie they we're saying things like, ""Oh, that was in the book."" The mice characters remind me of the Christmas characters during the 70's shows(stop motion). All the characters played thier parts very well. It was slightly different than the book, but that made the movie more interesting. The vaccum scene was very funny too.The Bad: The movie is only 43 minutes long, so it's too short. It did leave several scenes out, but not the major ones. It's only available on VHS.I'd love to see this movie remade in the future into a full length feature film, but until then- we have this exciting and fun video. My daughter (who is 5) really liked this movie too. Both boys and girls liked the film equally. I'm really glad I got this video."
3,It's a good book but I find others better.,Final Appoach is a good book. I was intrested in the book but not that intrested. I had read Pandoras Clock and Medusa's Child also by John J. Nance beore Final Approach I was not as intriqued as I was before by the other two. However I found this book very satisfying. It had lots of governments coverups. I think Nance does great research. His book was great. Every aspect of the plane is descriped. You just can't find better books Nance it the greatest author ever!
2,Boring and Tedious,"I have read other Nance books (""Medusa's Child"" and ""Pandora's Clock"") and found them to be much more intriguing and exciting than this snoozer. I kept waiting for some incredible, exciting event or revelation to occur in ""Final Approach"" but it never did. I had to force myself to read many parts of the book, which I have rarely had to do with other novels."
2,Best for Linux newbie or end user not admin,"Was looking for a book geared for RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 system admins looking for info on configuring RAID with mdadm, lvm2, and ended up with a book more geared for a desktop user more interested in games and novelties than serious system administration. I really don't think the book is geared toward Enterprise users and the word ""Enterprise"" should not be in the title. For what it goes over it does a good job but I was expecting more core unix admin information and examples."
4,Very good book... Dont hold you breathe for the DVD to work,I bought the book about two weeks ago and found it to be extreamly helpful... note the dvd with fedora 4 core is DEAD and CD2 is corupt No biggie if you have a high-speed connection you can get a copy at linux.org
2,Not what I expected.,I read a lot of reviews about this CD before I purchased it. Needless to say I was mislead. I've listened to this CD 6 times and it just doesn't grab me. The vocals aren't bad and the musicians are competent but the songs are boring. I'm not looking for originality just something that stays in your head and makes you want to go back for more. This isn't it!!It is Heavy Metal so I'll give it a few more trys but I think this one is more of a dust collector.
2,Wouldn't recommend it.,"I found this product to be a bit dated and primitive. Every time you open the program you have to listen to the same introductory English instructions, which quickly become annoying. The links for the online portion of the lessons seemed to be inactive. The best thing about the software is that it includes interactive exercises, in which you have simulated conversations with screen characters. Unfortunately, there are only a limited number of those exercises. I returned to package to the vendor, Nothing But Software. They were very helpful, and they gave me a prompt refund. In general, I'm sure that there are better software packages in a similar price range, for people like me who don't want to pay $500 for Rosetta Stone."
5,Great program,"I am a slow learner, The program allows me to work at my own speed in various ways. I love the audio CD's for use in the vehicle."
1,didn't work too well,"I started with this ok, but the microphone probably isn't too good. At least, I think mypronunciation is good enough to get past the second lesson -- but I couldn't. I gave up onit. It might work all right with a better microphone, and I'll try again some day."
1,this sucks.....,"This DVD is a mess. I know I was buying a incomplete DVD, but to cut out over 95% of the story makes no sense. I would have paid for a bigger DVD set. The story line makes no sense. If you didn't watch the story on television you will never understand it...all the good story lines are missing, the singing, songs and dancing that happened during the soap are also missing. Don't buy this if you want to keep remembering what a wonderful story this was.....its not worth it......"
2,a little disappointed,"There were a lot of scenes that were cut, for a person watching this for the first time, they would have been confused with the story because of the scenes that were not there.This is a great telenovela but it was butchered"
1,Fuego en la Sangre,"If you have not seen this telenovela some parts may be hard to keep up with. The editing is very bad in this film. Some major points were edited out of the film. I was very dissappointed with this DVD. I watched the telenovela on TV and knew on the DVD alot would be cut out, but way more was cut out. The DVD is mainly the love story of Sophia y Juan very little on Sarita y Franco, and Jimena y Oscar."
1,Save your money!,"English Subtitles!B music (although one song is good).Sofia cries while talking to herself or praying to the Virgin Mary.Juan is always in a fight.Others actors are in fight scenes.All star cast yet you mostly see Juan and Sofia.Crying with tears - crying with tears.The end.This was probably a good movie on television but the editing left us with crying, crying, crying; talking to self while crying; then fighting, fighting, fighting. They should have removed a lot of the crying and fighting and replaced it with story lines of the other actors."
1,Remake of a remake,This is a bad remake of Pasión de Gavilanes that just doesn't stand up to Pasión (I never saw Las aguas mansas but I think that's probably much better than Fuego en la Sangre).
1,Fuego En La Sangre,"No tengo idea sobre que pasa con estos productores, tienden a escoguer las mismas ideas e historia para producir una novela que ya fue hecha. Este es el caso en esta telenovela-aparenta ser la misma historia de ""pasiones de gavilanes"". Asi, que el que la vas a comprar tiene que estar pendiente a este pequeño detalle."
2,Poor Quality,"I have had two of these rings. The first ring completly lost the stone. The second chipped. I teach, so I do not think I am being overly rough on the product. I think it isn't made well, although it is very pretty."
4,A Country with many rulers,If America thinks she can setup a lasting govt in Afghan she is wasting her time.
5,Beautiful for anyone!,I have fair skin and red hair. I wear this shadow everyday to work with just mascara. I love it. It is absolutely fabulous! I also use it on the weekends with other eye makeup to go out. I think this shadow looks great on anyone!
1,These Towns Offer Affordable Living?,"Subtitled ""Discover Creative Communities, Fresh Air, and Affordable living"". The author obviously hasn't lived in these communities. Sedona, Nantucket, Carmel CA, Santa Cruz, Martha's Vineyard, Telluride, Key West, Vail, Sun Valley, Santa Fe and Deer Isle? Is he serious? Generally, the more unaffordable the town, the more gallery space there is. The author is most likely not used to living as an artist does."
3,Book Review,The book has a lot of intersting information and I am looking forward to investigating some of the towns on my own. I wish it was more geographically organized and has a few area maps.
2,100 Best Art towns in America,"Sadly, there was like 2 places in Michigan to go. This was not what I was looking for to plan my summer vacation."
5,A great duo.,"I read Holly Jacobs and Bonnie Tuckers two books last year, and couldn't wait for these. I love the bet that sets the heroines in motion. Very fun stories. I fell in love with both heroes. I'd never read a pharmacist hero before and loved when he tried to pretend and be a biker."
4,Before you go to a restaurant . . .,"""The Ethnic Food Lover's Companion"" is a great book if you like to go out to ""ethnic"" restaurants. (""Ethnic"", i.e., ""foreign food"" restaurants). In easy-to-read chapters it gives you information about culture, gastronomy, and history for most of the world's great cuisines: Europe (France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Russia, etc.); Africa (North Africa, Ethiopia, West Africa); Middle East; Greece and Turkey; India; Southeast Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines, etc.) Asia (China, Japan, Korea); Americas (Mexico, Caribbean, Brazil, Peru, etc.). There are descriptions of typical flavorings, cooking methods, and dishes. Highly interesting and recommended."
4,Full of knowledge but a bit dry,This text is the required reading for my CJUS400 class. The contained knowledge is worthy of study but the presentation is as dry as the Mojave Desert; a real page yawner.
2,Failure to Launch,"I am reviewing specifically the 6th edition of this book. As another reviewer said, the book is extremely dry. However, I'd have to disagree about being full of information. The book may have some information in between a bunch of fluff. I am not a criminology major but this book set the field back in my opinion for a few decades. A clear bias exists in every other page as the text torments and preaches to readers. I thought that a textbook's purpose is to inform and not to contort. I'd like to make my own conclusions please, Dr. Hagan. The only decent reason why this textbook could be readable is that they highlight the keywords in bold."
3,"Good, but not perfect","I own, and admit to occasionally re-reading, all 5 titles in the St. Anselm's series by Isabelle Holland. I enjoy the main character, Claire Aldington, but get frustrated when I find mistakes in this series (this is the first book of five). Where was the editor? Characters change their names slightly from book to book and details are also recapped wrongly as the books progress. I also can find the plots from other Isabelle Holland books (which I enjoy more perhaps because they have no sequels to be messed up) in this series. The lack of editing bothers me a lot, so if you like consistant details, watch out! But the stories are interesting nevertheless...they just make you want to do some rewriting to make these books better!"

5,"Seasons 1 and 2, and the last part of 4 were amazing.","Unfortnately, season three was the killer. While it had its decent spots, it was seriously lacking as far as advancing the plot and was an obvious attempt at a season 4. They got the season 4 and started out just like season 3, but then I guess they found out they were being canceled and got back on track. I wish they had just been a bit smarter, because this was honestly one of my all time favorite television shows. A season five with an actual story wrap-up would have been awesome, or even make a full feature film (or mini-series) to close it up.When season four ends, you might shed a tear because you will never know what happens. It's ""ending"" was not satisfactory to me because I had so many things I wanted to see a resolution to. But all complaints aside, this is worth watching.On a side note, if you like this, you might want to check out ""Taken"" which is an alien abduction show (mini series) that was just fantastic (Also stars Joel Gretsch)!"
3,"no ending, again","This was a great show that got cut short and again they cancel it without giving us an ending. I think from now on they should shoot the last episode at the same time as the first so they have it ready when they get canceled. I dont see any point in owning the set since the story just cuts off and according to the below from USA channel it will just have a documentary about where the show MAY have gone, not a conclusion to the stories.THE 4400 COMPLETE DVD BOX SET ARRIVES OCT. 28The entire critically-acclaimed and addictive fan-favorite series The 4400 is available for the first time in one complete box set! This comprehensive 15-disc set includes every episode from all 4 riveting seasons PLUS a brand-new bonus disc containing a never-before-seen look at where the series may have gone, an audio commentary, deleted scenes and more. A must have for any TV fan's DVD collection, complete the Emmy-nominated The 4400's unprecedented adventure with The 4400 Complete Series Box Set."
4,good show,I enjoyed the show on television but felt I needed to see it again to really understand it. It's a great show. The product itself arrived in excellent condition.
2,No subtitles whatsoever!,"I love the series, but I didn't like the DVD set for one simple reason: there are no subtitles whatsoever! BEWARE! I bought this DVD to watch with my wife, but she doesn't speak English fluently, so I was very happy to read on the product page that the DVD set had Portuguese subtitles. But, the product doesn't have subtitles as advertised! Not even English subtitles for the hearing impaired!On the DVD box set cover it states clearly ""Subtitles: English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese"". But... the episodes have no subtitles at all!I'm very disappointed."
5,Great Series,I really enjoyed watching this series on television and was sad that it only made it to 4 seasons. The set is really good and all the disks are easily accessible.
5,The 4400,"I enjoyed the 4400 very much. It was interesting from the beginning to the end.I recommend this series to anyone who is interested in a surprise a minute. It tells a good story that you can learn from amd enjoy, too. This series was purchased from Amazon."
4,No sutitles for seasons 1 & 2,"There are no sutitles for seasons 1 & 2, although it is written on the Amazon site & on the box set cover. I was very disappointed about that as I have some difficulty following the spoken English. I find it upsetting that the US Amazon does not check this before they promise to deliver a product! Season 3 & 4 do have subtitles. The series is great and I do not any complaint about it. The Canadian Amazon is the only site that I found which state exactly what the DVD include."
5,Absolutely loved this series,I really enjoyed watching the series Its so hard to find a good sci fi. Would have enjoyed a fifth season
4,Excellent for the pro's,"If you are a engineer looking for a book of formula's...this is your book. However it does little to explain things (such as the how's and why's)...you really must have a backround in mechanical or automotive engineering to understand things. By no means is this a beginners book, far to advanced in theory and mathmatics.I give it 4 stars because I know once I understand the complexity of the subject it will be a useful book...but its not a great teacher."
2,Good technical info but poor layout,"The technical info in this book is valid, but is presented in a confusing and discontinuous format. The book is essentially a series of short titled paragraphs followed by small, difficult to read graphs. All in all it is a bit difficult to glean the desired info because of the broken format."
2,narrator is a turn off!,"This video would have been fine, as it was actually quite informative, if it wasn't for the goofy and irritating narrator. The surfer language and ""Bill and Ted"" impression got old really fast. And I am not sure what the cake baking stuff had to do with musical instruments. It is because of him that I will NOT be purchasing the other videos.I showed it to my music classes and every child thought the narration was stupid. They did learn key things about instrument families etc. but found the narrator a turn off."
4,So soulful....,Her voice is magical. This is a soul-filled song of a love lost...and of memories past. I recommend you take a listen.
3,"Cute, but short.","This is a cute little book. It gives wonderful advice and is fun to read. The only problem is that it'll only take you, at the most, half an hour to read. There are nice quotes and interesting suggestions in this book."
3,Toro Wireless Rain Sensor,"This rain sensor replaced an older Toro wired rain sensor which failed after about 10 years of use. Although this unit functions reasonably well, I did not rate it 5 stars (when the previous model definitely was) because it takes much too long to react. In some cases it required 4-5 hours after a 2 inch downpour to turn off the sprinklers when set at 1/2 inch. My previous unit, which was also set at 1/2 inch would react within minutes of reaching the 1/2"" mark and would, in fact, turn off the system while in mid-cycle. I e-mailed Toro customer service to inquire if this was normal and never received a response. I may reset to 1/4"" to see if it reacts any sooner."
3,Dries out too quickly,"This will stop your sprinklers if it starts raining or has rained in the past few hours. But the sensor dries out in a day or so, so I still have to use the manual delay to prevent the sprinklers from coming on while the ground is still plenty wet."
5,An excellent history of the settlement of a portion of Indian Territory.,"This is an excellent historical account of one of the families who put the 'raw' in the term 'the raw frontier'.It traces the Paul family from it's east coast migration to final settlement in the beautiful Washita river valleyof the newly established Indian Territory which was to become the state of Oklahoma.This account also portrays the events that forged individual family traits that ranged from benevolence tohigh office as public servant to the shoot out and murder between father and son.Living near Pauls Valley, which the area was known while still Indian Territory and before it became the nameof the county seat of Garvin county, state of Oklahoma, I have a deeper appreciation and respect for the people,both Indian and non-Indian, who gave their blood and toil to over come their many differences to make thegreat state of Oklahoma great."
3,GOGO Golf Tees,"OK, but come apart after 18-20 holes. Done, over, over, over, over, over, Can't say anymore! Done, done, done, over!"
1,Poor Value,Bulbs do not last as long as claimed. I Found the bulbs cheaper in brick and mortar stores such as Lowes.
1,Wrong razor blades,"I order stanley razor blades because as an Oboe player, we need the sharpest razor blades we can get to shape cane. Stanley razor blades are the sharpest blades I've ever encountered. However imagine my surprise when I get my order and open up the box to find 200 GENERIC BRAND razor blades, not stanley ones. Do they simply think they are saving money by sending cheaper blades since most people wouldnt notice the difference?Normally I would send something like this back, but haggling over a 4 dollar order just seemed pointless. But needless to say I will buy my razorblades somewhere else from now on."
2,Nice rain coat but runs very large.,"I purchased two dog coats from Amazon, both medium. This one ran much larger than the other size medium coat. It's a cute coat but now I have to go through the hassle of returning it and getting the small."
3,A bit ill fitting,"It's a bit ill fitting, but overall it works well. My dog hates wearing it, but tolerates wearing it :-)"
3,Has a weird smell,"This rain coat is cute and serves the purpose. However, The extra large size was HUGE and the Large size is almost too small. The changes in size are drastic. The smell of it is like moth balls, gasoline and plastic which makes my dog smell that way. The smell does get somewhat better with time."
2,Disappointed,I had to return this. This size was wrong and it was too difficult to get over my Bijon's head. Disappointed.
3,Pretty in pink,"This doggie raincoat is adorable, but it smells horrible. I had to leave it outside and it has not gotten better. Do not have the heart to put it on my sweet puppy. Will be returning and looking for something else."
1,Too big! Probably 2 sizes too big for my 10 lb pup!,This looks really cute but like the other reviews --- too big! Even in an XS my 10 lb pup swims in it.This also does not work with longer dogs like my doxin mix.May have to do some DIY to alter it so it fits.
2,Good but too big,"My dogs generally wear a size Medium, but as most dog owner knows, a Medium can range from Shih Tzu size (my dogs) to a Springer Spaniel. Anyway, the raincoat would probably work just fine if it were the right size. I'd say a medium for this coat would probably fit a large Cocker Spaniel."
3,"Great coat, size is larger than expected","This raincoat is really cute and seems well made!HOWEVER, I ordered an X-Small coat for my petite yorkie, and the coat is HUGE on her! It seems more like a SMALL instead of an XSmall... So I think it would fit Malteses/Bichons/Poms/other small dogs better than it fits tinier dogs like yorkies and chihuahuas.Due to this size discrepancy, the coat is now useless to us."
3,Large!,"These coats are well made and look good but buyer beware and don't make the same mistake I did by trying to order the size your dog would normally wear. Be sure to order the next size down as they run at LEAST a size too large. If not for that that, probably would have given 5 stars."
2,rain coats for dogs,At first the coats look good and good material probably good for smaller dogs. The hoods don't fit right so my dogs heads get wet. I ordered a larger one for my smaller dog and I have to do some alterations so she does not trip over it. I did it so the hood would fit her head better. It does not even fit the male dog I have on the hood part. Well at least it keeps the rain off the back side. I wish someone would make a rain coat that the hood fit and the whole body is covered. Hate when they get wet.
3,Really weird size,"I've purchased it for my Bichon, bought small size, and sizewise this raincoat is really weird.In a front it's too long, looks like an apron, hanging all the way to the ground, even though my dog has a long proportional legs (like a model, lol)). And on a level of waist there is enough space for one more dog.Looks like it's made for extremely fat ball-shaped monster with abnormally long legs)). So i had to modify it. Cut it in a front and redo a belt with velkro. Then it fits my dog. Qualitywise it's decent. Anyway it protects my dog from the rain, so it does its job."
2,STONEWARE FROM CORELLE ????,"DEAR AMAZON SHOPPERS, I PURCHASED THIS SET AND THE DESIGN ISNICE, BUT I WAS IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE...MANY AMERICANS LIKETHEIR COFFEE RATHER THAN TEA AND SO I WAS LOOKING FOWARD TO4 CORELLE 11oz. MUGS MADE FROM ""CORELLE"" MATERIAL (NONBREAKABLE, ETC.)... HOW NICE IT WOULD BE NOT TO HAVE TO LUG THOSE STONEWARE MUGS AROUND, BUT HAVE A NICE CORELLE MATERIAL MADE MUG, LIGHTER,ETC... I WAS SHOCKED TO TURN THE MUGS OVER AND SEETHEM STAMPED WITH STONEWARE !!! THE ITEM DESCRIPTION SAYS CORELLE AND NOTHING ABOUT STONEWARE... I ENDED UP PAYING 10 TO 20 TIMES THE PRICE FOR A STONEWARE MUG, DEPENDING UPON WHEREYOU PURCHASE YOUR STONEWARE MUGS...VERY DISAPPOINTED INCORELLE CO...WHY SHOULD THE TEA CUPS BE CORELLE (MATERIAL) DURABLE & LIGHT, BUT NOT THE 11oz. MUGS....COFFEE CUPS (MUGS) ???"
3,DID NOT LIKE THE BOWL AT ALL!,"Although I liked the dinner plates and the salad plates, the matchingbowls did not seem to coordinate and did not blend well with the rest - they're so plain looking and out of style. I wish they designed the bowls with 'tusca vines' as well. I regretted ordering these set - I should have ordered for one more of the 20-piece instead of the 16-piece.Well, too late.."
4,"Less jokes, more anecdotes","Despite what the title suggest, this book is not a collection of jokes as ""treasury"" was. In this book the anecdotes are the main course. For those who know Asimov's bio in detail, some of these stories are already known; but a different take is always interesting. Those who dislike the way the old doctor talks about himself, probably should avoid this book."
3,Stop me if you've heard this one before...,"I've become quite a fan of Asimov's shorter works, so it was interesting to see him work in an even shorter form - the anecdote.A good deal of what's presented could very well benefit from being read aloud by someone who speaks well; some of them stood by themselves as entertaining bits and pieces.I came away with two feelings from this book: 1) that Asimov thought quite highly of himself in many regards (which isn't necessarily a bad thing; Harlan Ellison, one of my other favorites, thinks of HIMself in even higher regard) and, 2) the beauty of a joke isn't necessarily in the eye of the beholder, but of the teller."
1,so funny i forgot to laugh,It sucks don't buy it. It might have been funny 50 years ago. It is not humor its just stupid.
1,Not only unfunny but embarassing,"Isaac Asimov was one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time, but this book showed that there was a limit to even his talents. Most of the ""jokes"" are (a) not his; (b) not funny; (c) corny; and (d) sexually boring and/or gross. I was astonished that this was published in the 90's. It was so dated, I thought (before I checked the copyright notice) that it was published in the '70's and was supposed to be ""shocking.""Put this down and reread the Foundation series!"
4,toxic,"I have to watch this film again to better understand what i just watched. It's one of those films, like 21 Grams and Suicide Club. I loved the twist at the end. It's about a girl who escapes from a mental ward and her dad wants her found dead. Everyone she meest somehow ends up dead which is truth it seems. The dad's hitmen just have to follow the trail of dead bodies. Toxic is the club that everything is based around."
3,Made sense but had a split plot ... LOL,"The other reviewers are correct; this movie was intentionally misleading, just like Revolver.Not bad, but not good enough to get you excited."
2,As confusing as confusing can get,"This movie is really hard to follow. The plot is so twisted that at the end I still had no idea who all was still alive and who was dead. I got this because I am a Costas Mandylor fan, but this is not one of his better movies."
4,"very strange,and confusing movie","this movie was very weird, at times it was action, and then horror, the acting was really good, and the movie was very fast paced. I just think that the story could have been a little better, but all in all a solid move. So if you like weird, confusing fast paced horror / action this is deff the movie, I warned you though the movie is very confusing, with that said I still give it 4 stars , cause I definately did not see that endong comming."
3,Could have been better,"I had bought this DVD & when I played it I wasn't really able to watch the 1st disc due to it kept freezing & skipping, it wasn't scratched or anything but it did not want to work well."
5,GIRLFRIENDS FOREVER,THESE WERE MY GIRLFRIENDS FOR 6 SEASONS....ONCE TONI LEFT THE SHOW WAS NOT THE SAME....BUT IT WAS THE BEST 6 SEASONS I HAVE EVER HAD WITH A SHOW AND I WILL PURCHASE ALL 6 SEASONS(DIDNT LIKE 7TH SEASON) SO I CAN CONTINUE TO HANG OUT WITH MY GIRLFRIENDS.
5,Girlfriends - The Fifth Season,The is the better seasons of Girlfriends because Darnell and Mya get closer to getting back together and Todd and Toni marriage goes on the rocks and their baby born. I love this session. Definitely recommend.
4,"Good, but not great!","I read this b/c i had read the 1st Savannah book. This is just o.k.. I love the characters but it just seems that so much more could be done with them. A lot of people may not be able to identify too because of how wealthy Savannah's family is and how she really wants for nothing. I know there are people in the world like her but some may not be able to relate. I found myself waiting for the big moment to arrive just like I did in the first novel and it never really did. The entire storyline just seemed so silly and unrealistic. However, this book is very wholesome and clean- a good change for the times we are living in."
3,Kindle book,For those followers of the Savanah series of books it was a good read. I really enjoy reading these type of books on my Kindle
2,Lacking in many ways,"I hate to be critical, but this was a poorly written book. I enjoyed reading the first book, Savannah From Savannah, because I grew up in Savannah, and enjoyed how she depicted the city. But this second book was lacking in character development, coherent plot, meaningful dialogue. The author seemed to be struggling with what story she was trying to tell. (Much like her character in the book!) I trudged through the book to the end, but it was much like eating stale cotton candy. The words dissolved as quickly as I read them, never forming a satisfying ""meal"". I feel like the story just never came together."
2,Ok...,"I read ""Savannah From Savannah"" and really liked it. I couldn't wait to read it's sequel. Well... the sequel was definitely not as good. Savannah turned into a really big self-centered brat. It was so slow and took 250 pages before something interesting happened. Then, I couldn't put it down. I agree with some other reviews that one should not read this book unless they've read the first book, otherwise they'd be very confused. The last five chapters were really exciting and, dare I say, enough to make me want to read the third book, ""Savannah by the Sea."""
4,Very durable and useful!,"I bought this for my son who likes to help me cook. He has used it to get things for himself and to help me cook many times. It is not very high, so I think the stool part would be better used for slightly older kids (my son is 6). The chair part would be best for younger children, but my son still uses it to sit drinks, plates, and other things on.The stool is very durable, and I have even used it on a couple occasions. I bought this off of Amazon for VERY cheap (only a few dollars), but I do think it is worth more than that--although maybe not the regular $40 price tag. Overall, this stool is very useful and looks really nice too!"
3,Hard to find international Pop Music,"I purchased this disc for my Thai/Laos mother. She likes to hear music from her country. The availability of what I was seeking is slim to none. The order came quickly which was great! The music is VERY traditional and ""boring"" for those seeking more modern Thai music."
1,Frustration,For fifteen years I've been searching for a then popular Thai song: KON JON RON RAM. I will pay anything to find it! $$$$$$$$$$ Are there any Thai music experts out there in cyberspace? Email me at <capbode@hawaii.rr.com>
5,An RN from Florida,"I read this book in one evening. Thank you, Kay Henrion! Finally, an easy to read, informative book on health alternatives. Ms. Henrion wrote this book with humor and personal experience. I loved it and will recommend to my friends and patients. Pat Fitzpatrick, RN"
4,Good Children's Book,"A good addition to a collection on the Underground Railroad, and the history of the importance of quilting in the 19th century."
1,Rehash of the disputed secret quilt code,"This wonderfully illustrated book attempts to tell the story of a little girl and her father and their quest to find freedom from slavery. What is most disturbing is that the book's content focuses on the ""secret quilt code"" which scholars and historians have been disputing ever since the book Hidden in Plain View was published in 1999.Even though we realize that the use of quilts with secret messages is an appealing theme, researchers have found no evidence that quilts or quilt blocks were used in any way to guide slaves to freedom. Thus, this book shares incorrect historical information with an unsuspecting audience. This does a great disservice to African-American people everywhere especially when there are more worthy topics that could be covered which celebrate their strength, ingenuity, and courage in the face of adversity."
1,Moroccan belly dance,"This CD is rather monotonous. The 1-2-3 rhythmn is pervasive throughout. If you want Moroccan belly dance music, I would recommend Chalf Hassan's other Belly Dance from Morocco Cd which has more variety of speed and melody!"
2,Out There in the Dark,"The review I read for this book was quite positive, and since I am a fan of ""old Hollywood,"" I ordered the book. It was most disappointing. Not very well written, cardboard characters, dull plot, tended to ramble. I did finish it, but felt it was a waste of time and money."
4,good card,this is a really good deal a 32 mb card for a low price and it's a good quality card. The fact that it's a hercules 3d prophet told me that it would be a good card. i've seen other hercules cards and this one to me is a steal for it's low price and still a 32 mb card. i've seen other cards that tell you they're good but they don't say what they mean. if you were looking for a bargain and a good card you should go for this one.
2,Overpriced and incomplete,"As per usual, my ratings given are for this release, and not for the content.Simply put, this is not a a true ""Collector's Edition"". It's priced as one, but it's not at all a complete edition, something on this scale and at this price should include all the original japanese language soundtrack with english subtitles.A real let down.Sadly even if you remember it in english as a child, you don't get that because the studio destroyed the original copies. So it's not so good for nostalgia, and not good for japanese animation buffs."
4,Good series,"Being the last book in the series, this was a good read. I'm glad it wasn't too over dramatic and the plot wasn't stretched out. It moved along well, and there were no loose strings at the end. The artwork is fantastic! It really captures the characters' personalities well!"
2,After reading Genshiken...,"To be fair, I've only read this volume and the Comic Party spinoff books, but, after watching the first episode of the anime, I looked forward to reading this series. However, the idiosyncratic otaku characters of Genshiken make the formulaic characters of Comic Party just that much more obvious and hollow. If you've enjoyed the previous manga volumes, I'm sure this last book will be just as much of a pleasure. But if your manga dollars are limited, I'd suggest the slightly higher-priced Genshiken."
2,Book would be better but for many errors,"Contains much info on sports nicknames, but the many errors are maddening, especially since a lot of them could have been eliminated by anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of sports. Examples--book states that ""Orioles"" was first applied to a pro baseball team in 1833; several NFL teams are placed in the wrong division/conference; the Indiana Pacers are alleged to have taken their name from the ABA team; they actually WERE that ABA team. I could go on--one entry mentions the 7th game of the World Series, that series went 4 games. Many ommissions--in the list of origins of team names, it is not stated how, for example, the Devil Rays and Marlins got their names."
2,Don't expect much,"I saw this book in the bookstore and it looked like a sports lovers dream. After receiving it, I realize it was a mistake to buy. There are so many errors in this book they aren't even worth describing. Also, the college names section doesn't even give a backround on the names. The book reads like it was written by old men."
2,Other books are better,"This book is okay, but if you want to read about nicknames read Terry Pruyne's book about Sports Nicknames. Pruyne's book has many more nicknames than Phillips and Burnham"
4,Great book!!!!,My daughter loves this book...The only thing that i dont like about this book is that pages are card stock. So if you have a young child that doesn't understand that you have to be nice to the book then I would wait till they understand that we dont rip books.
4,"har,ha,har","lots of fun,big bad bruce is a big bad bear who gets in trouble for rolling rocks at small woodland creatures,but in the end he is cute and loveable,but still gets in trouble for rolling rocks my 5.5yo thinks its a hoot"
4,"Narvalo, Gypsy Flamenco","The songs are hot and firey. Two main singers, a male and a female from the Camargue are backed by a professional band with a Gypsy Kings style orientation. This is gypsy pop music, sung in Spanish, not in the Rromani language. The singers are of a more ethnic, folk-flamenco background and the backup group gives their music a rock orientation. It is a good album, but the combination of folk singers with a professional backup band gives it something of a produced quality. If you like flamenco pop music, you'll like this album. The somgs are great."
1,Not so Rugged Stapler,I purchased the Advantus Corporation desk stapler because it looked like it would hold up and I remember using one like it when I was a child. Well only after 2 weeks it has stopped working. In order to make it staple even one piece of paper the back spring must be removed and all staples taken out then replaced and it is ready to press ONE staple. Then the whole process must be repeated for the next stapling. I have e-mailed the company but I have not heard from them. I am sorry I bought this stapler.
4,The classic stapler,"Beautiful design for any desk style from newsroom to modern workspace. Bang it with your fist if you like, and yell ""copy!"""
3,the value is in the test,"I read the translation of this book in september 1997. The thing I like about the book is the test (EQ map) - in fact, I recommend buying the book for taking the test. The book itself isn't that great, especially the link between the test and the rest of the book is ratther weak (to say the least). A more extensive review can be found on my website, 7EQ.com. Conclusion: if you want to test your EQ, buy this book. If you want to develop it, look elsewhere."
5,Most Practical Management Book I have ever read,"Robert Cooper's book is heads above all the other enmotional intelligence books on the market. The others empahasize to much theory. This author is heavy on practical proven approaches that are based on people be authentic with one another and working together. Granted this book may not be for those who don't have the guts to push themelves to grow to heights not even mentioned in typical management theories. Honesty, putting the customer first, being genuinine, etc... have all but become extinct today. Robert Cooper's book issue's a challenge to all of us. To be the best means competing against your own standards so you can best serve your customers first and making a profit helps you do that better. Bravo Dr. Cooper."
5,amazing book,"a LOT of knowledge in this book. introspective, yet easy to read and hard to put down. can't say that about too many business books."
5,Rude Boys - Time 2 Skank!!!,Lots and lots of great tracks to keep you rocking and grooving here! Many of these tracks will take you and your friends down memeory lane and are foundation riddims plus they are hard to find anyway - so get it!
3,just a collection of circuits,"If you're just looking for a collection of oscillator circuits, this book is for you. However, there is no practical information to guide the reader in the proper use of these circuits. There are plenty to choose from, but which ones are best suited for what situations? That's probably common sense to anyone who has had some sort of formal electronics education, but to the self taught tinkerer, or home experimenter, you might be better off finding another resource. It is a good book though if all you are looking for is a collection of schematics because that's all it has."
5,The best MP3 book I have bought,"Finally someone dared to write the book that tells what we want to know about MP3 and not just the surface junk. So many of the MP3 books that I have bought and read are filled with stuff that is boring and meaningless. It is almost as if the authors are afraid to write about this topic but they go ahead anyway hoping to sell a book. The CDs included with most books have been as dull as the book itself. Not so in this case. The book is written with a touch of humor which makes for enjoyable reading. Several times I found myself laughing right out loud at comments made. Not many computer books warrant reading every page but thats what I ended up doing with this book. I found the CD included things I could use right away. Also, this book is written so that even computer novices like myself can understand it. Too many times I find that authors assume that we all understand the entire workings of the computer world."
1,Poor Quality for a Good Concept,"I bought this tripod several years ago but have only used it a FEW times for special circumstances. I was planning to snap photos of a lunar eclipse last night only to have 3 of the leg clamps break off tiny pieces at the hinges rendering it useless. I was utterly shocked. I had really been pleased with this tripod up until that happened. Upon reading other reviews, I discovered that this is a common occurrence. I bought it on a whim while in a photo supply store. Next time I will be researching first. I warn other potential buyers to do the same."
5,785,"This is a great travel tripod. It is very light and small. And with the head off will almost disappear in a 22"" roll aboard suitcase. I use it with a hand held video camera and can easily handle my canon 40d. Would I walk more then arms length away from it? No probably not. but my camera would probably be gone if I did. It is grate for long exposures and steadying video.The most important thing is that it is small enough that I bring it with me."
4,Great tripod,Unfortunately for me the head cannot really support (and the box makes it clear) and DSLR/SLR with a weightier lens - which was what I was hoping for. By the time I got this setup I was past the return date. :(
4,Very good tripod.,"I have Canon Powershot S3IS with the len adaptor and additional telephoto lens, which make the weight totally around 600-700g. This tripod is perfectly work with my camera and those extentions. It provides stable base in almost every surface. I once used it in the quite fast-flowing steam, with round rocks paving. The weight of the tripod itself is quite light, though my old cheeply-flimsy plastic tripod weigh less (but with less stability when stands)... It looks professionally and the price is unbeatalbe at Amazon.com. The only con about this tripod is that it doesn't come with any bag, and the Bogen/Manfrotto original bag for tripod costs more than this tripod itself. (This is why I gave it only 4 stars rating) Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase, and will definitely recommend everybody to invest in this product."
4,great travel tripod,"This is a very light tripod that easily fits into a travel on suitcase and on the outside of my day pack. While it's good for horizontal landscape photos, it doesn't have the strength to hold up an SLR + lens in the verticle position for a portrait vs. landscape view."
1,cheap unsteady tripod,"This tripod is completely useless. It's too light, unsteady, made of cheap plastic. I tried it with video and photo cameras. I got better result by holding camera in hands. This tripod is swinging in all directions. Save your money and buy more expensive one."
2,Really like the features but can't use tightener,"Length:: 0:17 MinsBought on Sept 30, 2010. First photo shoot Dec 30,2010 it stopped working. The thumb grip button for the ball, you press it and a second later it pops up by itself. Using with Canon Rebel T2i and kit lens. Will try warranty repair if possible.Hi again, I am going to give it a second chance. This time I will press very much harder on the lock button. I did this just now and my slr is tilted foward and hasn't come loose. So I will do some shooting tomorrow and see if pressing really hard fixes the problem.The factory sent me a new one and suggested I only use it with Point and Shoot cameras. So far it has worked with these. Suggested weight is less than maximum weight limit."
4,Great for travel,"The tripod packs up quite nice and small. I took it to Europe with me and it was really great. I was worried about the weight limits with a DSLR, but it worked out mostly fine. I used a Canon digital rebel with a 28-200 lens on it and the only time I had an issue was when I had the camera turned on it's side for a vertical shot. It would start to drift slowly downward with the weight of the lens. Standard horizontal pictures were not a problem, even with the lens fully extended."
3,"Probably very good for a Point and Shoot, but DO NOT USE WITH DSLR","I own a Canon XTi DSLR. Although this tripod was made for point and shoots, I read other 5-star reviews that mentioned this is perfectly fine for a DSLR. I decided to bite the bullet and try it out for myself.When Manfrotto says it is only for POINT AND SHOOTS, TAKE THEIR WORD FOR IT AND DO NOT TRY IT WITH A DSLR.Now my XTi didnt fall off the tripod or anything, but the pictures I took on the tripod on lowlight situations did not work out. Super blurry. This tripod simply is not sturdy enough to keep my XTi steady for long exposure shots.So if you are a DSLR user like me, stay away from this one."
1,"Lightweight, but cheap tripod","Manfrotto (usually) is a leader in tripods -- this tripod, however, does not meet with the typical Manfrotto standards. After one photo shoot trip, one of the leg clamps broke off, which now prevents me from locking the leg in the fully extended position. Two other clamps are cracked (cheap plastic) and will quickly fall victim to the same fate if I were to use this tripod again.My attempts to get mine repaired or replaced from the manufacturer have not been successful. My tripod lasted for one photo shoot. This was initially a great tripod to carry rather than lugging around my larger, heavier unit -- but consider this a disposable tripod and not for long-term use.Summary: you get what you pay for."
5,Tough to find the perfect fireworks tripod.... this may be it,"Shooting fireworks video and stills is a whole different fiasco than what many run into, so we were looking for something that would travel internationally with ease, whether we were on a nice plane or on a shady bus ride into the country. This item has been great for that - it is very well built and collapses to a very small and easily concealed size.However, as others have stated, it is not the most sturdy tripod I have ever used, and it has difficulty staying still with even a small hd-video camera attached. As its length is less than some, it can be difficult to get high-up effect shots without actually pulling the top foot of the tripod off the ground to follow the shot. This works quite well once you get the hang of it.Beautiful construction, gets the job done, perfect for travel. Highly recommended for international travel."
4,Very good tripod,"I was looking for something light and compact to carry. I was willing to sacrifice some stability for small size. While it is not as flexible as the pro tripods, it's light enough to be carried around. And even if I decide to upgrade to a pro tripod in the future, this will be my travel tripod. It is a solidly constructed for quality tripod, especially for the money you pay. The head is very, much easier to reposition the camera; just have to be careful you hold the camera when releasing the lever. I found that was a misleading in previous that total load is 2.2 lb it's rated for 4.4lb by manufacturer. It has no serious problem to hold my Pentax *istDS with 70-300mm lens or Nikon D70S with 18-70 mm. But it's definitely not a steadiest tripod on the market but it wasn't designed for this. I definitely at least check it out in your local store if you a looking for LIGHTWEIGH & COMACT tripod."
1,Great for the first 15 Minutes,"This tripod could be a great product. However, it started to break after 15 minutes of use. I bought this tripod as a small and compact travel tripod for my back-up Nikon D60 body. When I brought the tripod home I was impressed with the overall design, features and weight. I set up the camera and tripod once with camera and then put it away. The next day I went back to play with it once again and found that two of the latches that hold the leg sections in place were broken. The parts that hold the latch pin in place had split and broken. Upon further inspection I noticed that three of the same parts on the latches were split and about to break. This could be a wonderful design, but the quality issues must be solved."
1,Garbage,"I rarely used this tripod and the head on the base that secures the camera to the tripod cracked allowing the camera to slip off the tripod easily. Then I went to their website, was a pain in the *** to try to get warranty service! Instead I'm throwing this piece of garbage out...and buying a quality tripod. Lesson learned...you get what you pay for! Save your money and time and buy another brand. Would YOU really want your $1500.00 worth of camera gear on a tripod that could not be trusted to hold it securely?"
4,Good book for writers,"This is excellent for beginning readers and writers of poetry. In the essays at the beginning, Koch is successful at convincing the reader that poetry is not as hard as we make it out to be. If we relax and don't allow ourselves to be intimidated, we can enjoy poetry. The rest of the book is devoted to groups of poems, each by one poet, thereby allowing the reader to get to know writers' styles. At the end of each section is a poetry writing exercise asking the reader to write a poem in the style they have just read. These are excellent exercises for broadening anyone's writing; they have certainly broadend my own writing. The only criticism that I have of the book is that the poets included are mostly men. I would think that it could have been more inclusive of women, especially the confessional poets such as Plath whose style new poets may grasp. Overall, this is a great book for teachers, writers, and readers."
5,Attention Food Lovers!,"This is a fascinating book. I find myself flipping from article to article and I have trouble putting it down. It is truly comprehensive, and well organized. It makes for fun reading, but is also a great reference if you come across some sort of obscure food item in a recipe or elsewhere."
4,Interesting,"Good concise explanations for a number of scientific, philosophical and economic principles. Each section teaches the major gist of a key idea or principle without getting deep into detail that would require previous knowledge. If you have a broad span of interests (particularly scientific) you'll enjoy this book. Several economic principles are covered. I found them particularly interesting due to my complete lack of a background in economics. Whatever you know, you can learn a great deal from this book."
1,How have things changed,"Judging by the history of WOW CD's and my first encounter with WOW 98, I was quite impressed with the quality, selection of songs and it's arrangement. I have since seen this standard droped but this one is an absolute disaster. I wish I could have my money back because this is not worth paying a penny for. There were 2 or 3 songs in there that are manageable, I 'll say who ever compiled the videos has bad taste. This is the 1st WOW DVD that I know of and one would expect it to be an absolute hit rather it is the opposite. It feels like the whole compilation was made in a haste without considering the different audience that it attract. Most of the songs are rock like artist, surely 2 would be Ok but not to the tune of 5 or 6. Unless the copies on sale can be withdrawn and another one (WOW Hits 2002) produced with new songs (which I know will not happen), I 'll not say thank you if you gave WOW Hits 2002 to me as a gift."
3,It is what it is,This is an anthology of gross out stories so what you get are gross out stories if anything they are fun if lacking in any literary merit don't read if looking for the short story collection of the year read if you want something gross and fun i would recommend
5,Perfect fit!,"This lens fit my boat's light pole perfectly, allows sufficient light at night for navigation purposes, and does not blind the person fishing in the rear of the boat. I would recommend this lens to anyone."
3,An Interesting Insight into History,"We use this in my US History AP course and it's an interesting supplement. We read one piece each week. Some are amazing, others are rather pointless, but the book does a nice job of introducing each piece, and I also like the glossary they have with terms used. Overall it's pretty good."
4,"Disturbing, but NOT soft-core porn","Just have to defend this book, which I have read many times and still think achieves a lot in terms of characterization and plot for a trashy mass market novel. It does indeed involve a variety of disturbing subject matter, and some involves children (though Sanders clearly does not condone it). But it is not soft-core porn, for goodness' sake. It uses sex to keep your attention...what an unusual concept!! ... Also I love all the discussion of their business deals and speculation about the looming ""home video"" market. Lots going on here, something for everyone."
4,Semi-Classic Lawrence Sanders,"This book is one of Sanders' better ones. It takes place in South Florida (where Sanders' lived) with a host of interesting characters. It has something for everyone: Sex, drugs, murder and everything else except rock n roll. This book was published in 1982 with some very insightful observations about the society in which we live in and it still rings true today."
1,a cold and shallow book,"This is a ludicrous cardboard account of psychiatric practice and of people who need psychiatric help. It seems as though the author gathered elsewhere a few short threads of fact, took them home and twisted them into personal pretzel shapes of mild soft porn. Definitely, a little learning is a dangerous thing and the archaic postulation of ""penis envy"" made me hoot. The narcissic adults were as unconvincing as paper dolls. Some of the material involving children actually seemed uncomfortably like the author's indulgence in private fantasy you hope he doesn't take beyond the printed page. It was hard to reconcile the author's self important tone with this immature and improbable story. Or maybe not. I was stuck in a place with absolutely nothing else to read. Zero stars."
5,Dead on and dead funny,"This book is 4 years old, yet it still hits home with smart bomb accuracy.Perfect for anyone who is fed up with film snobs, pop culture 'experts' and people who express their individuality by dressing, acting, and thinking like....everyone else expressing their individuality."
5,Place of honor on bookshelf,"I don't keep too many books, but this is one I will keep. Yes he references Your Money Or Your Life quite a bit, and that too is worth reading, this book stands on it's own and is a complement to YMOYL."
4,Really great book,"This should be mandatory reading for anyone who participates in the economy. It so simply and realistically lays out how our actions have intended and unintended outcomes - and that both are equally real and worthy of equal consideration . It's impossible to be at least mentally unchanged after reading. If you read this book and your actions remain unchanged, you are at least aware of both the good and the ill growing from your decisions.Anyone unaware of the principles in this book (either by reading it or innate knowledge) should be (effectively) considered a mental child.Read this to graduate to adulthood."
5,Works,"Worked perfectly for hooking up my Sony handycam to my computer, at a fraction of the price of buying it in a retail store."
2,incredibly flawed,"its odd because the writing itself in the book is very good. The Introduction is surprisingly entertaining to read. But after that the book falls shortPros:Good WritingCons:Where is the bridge to ""Dammit""?What is up with the interlude for ""Stay Together for the kids""?Where is the second half of the main riff for ""adams song""Where is the second guitar part on the end of ""dammit""Its called a ""tabliture"" book for a reason. dont write how the music is played in scentences and paragraphs.Its funny because, whats there is good.Theres just not enough there"
1,Don't buy here,"Bought two.. one appears to be working ok, the other reads ""low toner"" as soon as you put it in, despite shaking it vigorously prior to insertion. It also prints terrible.. consistent w/ being low in toner. Second time this has happened to me.. but in the other case I hadn't tested both when I ordered two. The second one was bad, but it was too late to return it. Be sure to ck all of them if you order more than one cartridge."
5,"Very nice, very slick","I'm a huge fan of Chines/Japanese films and in the last 10 years, or so, the Chinese have gotten very slick in their film making techniques. This film is excellant on every level and is well worth the money. The only (repeat only) criticism I would make is that the editing on the fight sequences is too choppy. Such editing is used to enhance the chaotic effect of violence and allows actors with no martial experience to seem proficient; which is a good thing most times. Violence is usually an incoherent emotional jumble of images. However, I miss the Shaw Brothers old school technique of letting the actors work through extended choreographies and can't help but think even a movie as fine as this one is would have been helped a bit by one such scene. That said, this is a great film. Buy it, you won't be disappointed."
4,Great Period Film,For those who like Chinese period films like Hero etc you will enjoy this.Well shot with good action scenes by a cast of largely unkown actors in the West it is well worth a look.
3,Warriors of Heaven and Earth,I enjoyed this movie still it didn't give me that kick an punch I thought would come. The Fight scenes were ok well can't like them all the same.
3,Not thinking clearly when buying this DVD,"Did I even pause to think about this being a foreign film when I purchased it? No, I did not. It is my own fault, so I cannot blame anyone else. I did, however, look at the reviews (most of them) and purchase it on that basis. It would have given me pause had I known it was subtitled rather than dubbed in English. Thus, my review. To anyone who cares...this is a subtitled movie. If you don't want to read your movie and don't speak Chinese, think about your purchase."
3,Tool,"This is just to respond to the intellectually challenged fellow who made the claim that this film somehow demonstrates a Chinese failure to grok Buddhism. Does watching Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade convince you that Christianity is a mystery to the culture from whence the film sprang? At least try not to say stupid things, pretty please.That aside, the film isn't very good. There are some nice scenic shots, but nothing else is particularly commendable. I didn't mind watching it, but I'm glad I didn't buy it."
5,A pretty nice serie,"This DVD contain the ending to the first season of this serie, which I thought is a pretty good. The graphics is quite nice and detailed; the story has a good balance between seriousness and humor; the universe/background setting is also interesting and contains a lot of potential. Keep in mind that this is the first season, which is just more or less an introduction to the real story, which starts on the 2nd season. It's one of the few anime series and made me sit and watched through the whole thing in one sitting. I have yet to watch all of the 2nd season and I'm looking forward to it. There is also a 3rd season."
1,"Really terrible, low budget, badly acted movie","If you want a well made film with decent acting look elsewhere. It is really understandable that this took two years to come out and came straight to DVD quietly. Anna deserved better and the lead (Ford) was not a great choice, her talent as an actress is slightly above the Hills cast members, with less class (but to be fair Heidi is giving her a run for her money). If you want a campy movie- rent it or look on-line. Not funny enough, even as a campy movie to want to see it more than once."
3,Basically A TV Movie Loosely Based On Anna's Life,"Where do I start with this movie? The title of my review pretty much says it all. I don't want to talk down about this movie for the simple fact that I am a huge Anna Nicole Smith fan, and I am happy there was a movie made about her. BUT this movie is not accurate AT ALL. It left out way too much! I do think Willa did the best of her ability as playing Anna, I just don't think they gave her too much to work with. I hope someday they will make a better movie for Anna, one with a better budget. One of the things that ruined this movie for me was the tacky music! It was horrible! I did like the last scene of the movie, I won't spoil it for you who have not seen it. But it does make it seem like Anna is in a better place now and finally at peace. RIP ANNA WE MISS YOU!!!"
4,Please Help!,"Do you know the name of the song in the opening credits? If you love Anna the way I do, you will appreciate the movie...for just that.....a movie. But as far as covering her actual life, not so informative. It ended before it began, and had huge gaps all along the way. Sad really, I wanted a Bio! I can only hope that someday someone else will take her life and her attributes a little more seriously, with an informative, factual film. AND SERIOUSLY!!!!! Does anyone know the name of the song played in the opening credits? Half country, half club mix! Catchy, but invisible! Please help me! I'm going crazy!!"
1,"Ordered Colonial White, received BEIGE/TAN","Ordered this product, in February 2012. Just now opened the box and found that they shipped me other than the Colonial White color ordered.Lesson learned: OPEN/INSPECT as soon as received. OOP's on me.As BEIGE/TAN will fail to blend in with my white vehicle, Now have to order again, hoping that 'they' will send the ordered color.Product will work as described. Just color, the problem."
4,Une série qui vous rendra accro!,"J'en suis maintenant au huitième tome de cette série et je peux vous garantir qu'elle est absolument enlevante. L'histoire se passe dans un monde à cheval entre le Moyen-ge et le fantastique. Un peu dans la lignée du Seigneur des anneaux de Tolkien.Le premier tome est moins rempli de rebondissements que les autres mais c'est tout simplement parce que l'auteure prend le temps de bien camper ses personnages.C'est vraiment une série qui vaut le détour! L'essayer, c'est l'adopter!"
4,Very happy with our video survelliance...,So far the system works great. It did take a while to figure out why I could not see it on the IP address. The network cable connection is very badly built. Customer service was efficient and very attentive trying to help me figure out what was happening. I have had the system about a month and I am very happy
4,Good Value but Fair Image Quality,"I purchased this product to monitor activities at my restaurant. Set up was fairly easy. However, the image quality could be better. For its price, I can't complain too much. Still waiting for response from customer support on how to set up Internet access."
5,Great Eyes,"Very easy to install. Good Price (except [...] just lowered the Lorex 8 camera system - not sure about all features).Easy set up and on screen selections. Viewing over Internet not as clear as viewing on local monitor.Good color and if I needed to, I would buy it again."
3,"Good, but not great","I am just installing this system. The basic function is pretty easy to set up. I have one camera installed and it works pretty well in bright light, but is a little disappointing in the dark.The mount for the cameras is a definite drawback to this system. I had to mess around with the mount on the first camera for it to work. Even so, I am not sure the camera will hold position for any length of time. The mount is poorly engineered and machined. I was also disappointed to find no instructions regarding camera mounting. I have no idea of how secure this camera will be in adverse weather. I had considered covering the point where the wire enters the camera with a silicone seal, since it does not look waterproof. At this point, I have just mounted it under my soffitt, hoping it will not be subject to driving rain.Once I get all the cameras installed,I will work on getting the system hooked up to the internet. At that time, I plan to modify my review."
1,hard drive failure after only 6 mos.,"i bought this camera and only used it about six months and the hard drive broke. i am very discusted. i have to call the manufacturer to see if they will do something about this..hopefully they will, if not, i warn you not to buy this system."
1,Very unhappy,"This system broke down after three weeks of usage (HDD failure). I got another one which was defective upon arrival. The third one was again defective and had the same ""HDD failure"" problem. Very unhappy with SVAT. I finally purchased a different brand and it's been working for over a year with no problems. I don't recommend this product at all."
1,Expensive Junk,"In the 14 months I have owned this system, I have had to have all 4 cameras replaced. For some reason they all quit working 1 by 1 in a single day. They had power, and the microphones worked, just no video. SVAT replaced them under warranty without a problem, but when I asked what would cause the cameras to fail, they didn't have an answer. My suspicion was a problem with the DVR. Well, 2 months out of warranty, the DVR would no longer send a video signal to either a TV or a computer through the network jack. It showed it was recording, and the computer screen controls would display, just no video. Now mind you, this DVR was on a dresser in my bedroom, and all the cameras and DVR were plugged into a surge protector. Not an environmentally hostile environment. SVAT basically told me I was SOL. So now I'm off to buy a new DVR, and you can bet it won't be SVAT!!"
3,It works,It has good video quality. You can set it up to see it from your computer using the internet. It has the option of recording when there is motion or always.I did not like that is hard to review what it records. I would like to be able to record on my computer too.
1,DO NOT BUY. NO QUALTIY CONTROL,"I bought this item thinking it was good value for money. When I got it and hooked it up, I realized one camera was not working. Before I had time to send that one camera back, the hard drive failed. I sent it back at my expense of course, when I got the replacement the network card wasn't working. I am totally fed up with this POS system and would much rather my money back and put a little more towards something with higher quality standards. This is clearly an item cheaply sourced from China and rebranded with absolutely no hint of durability. If you're still thinking of purchasing this, then good luck.PS. Giving this one star feels like I am over rating it."
1,No technical support!,"Svat advertises 24/7 support; this consists of the videos they have on their website... I have tried to contact SVAT for networking set up; by phone, email and live chat... I recieved a phone call on the 5th day of calling etc, only after leaving a message stating that I was returning the product and going to write a bad review... The live chat is never live, emails have not been answered... Set up is not as easy as said to be..."
1,Undependable,"UPDATE - now the third of four cameras has failed in less than a year. What a total waist of time, money and the effort to install them.Thought it would be a good deal for an entry level consumer system - reasonably easy to install and operate straight out of the box. The first camera failed after about 90 days, losing it's color capability. Annoying but tolerable. Now within six months a second camera has failed completely - awaiting a response from SVAT. Doesn't matter how good customer support is - the hassle of HAVING to repeatedly remove them, send them off, wait for them to come back, get in the attic and on the roof to swap them out is a pain. Will be returning the entire thing if anything else fails."
2,Not what I was looking for.,Didn't like this book and will see if I can return it. A large portion was explaining the characteristics all of the signs. Not what I expected. Already know that stuff. I was looking for monthly & yearly overviews. This seemed to have the daily views but not what I personally wanted.
1,"Vietnam ""Regeneration"" Fails","As a member of the ""Vietnam Generation"" and a Vietnam Vet whose daily link to the ""World"" was Cronauer, and his successors at AFVN, many of the titles on this album have great meaning. Unfortunately, the Dutchman who remastered and/or remixed these songs never heard of American Rock 'n Roll and is unaware of how attuned we are to the music. Though I don't doubt that these are the original artists, the production quality of this album is so poor that the songs sound like inept covers of great tunes. DO NOT buy this album. Don't even accept it as a gift. Amazon would do well to do a little QC on the products that they distribute. P.S. As a music lover who is near fanatical, I am well aware of who Nina Simone is, and the great work she's done, BUT, I don't ever recall hearing her on AFVN or any AFRTS programming before, during or after my tour."
1,Re: Oops,"The line up for this CD sounded great. But I should have known better.The general quality of the sound on this CD is bad, and if that isn't enough to disappoint, they have selected some truly bad examples of songs. One version to watch out for is 'Born to be Wild'. Loved the original version how the '97' version made into a collection of Vietnam era music I have no idea. And it is a really bad version.My advice: Stay well away. Save your money. There are better collections out there."
1,Album not to buy,"I was looking forward to listening to this album, but when it came and I began to listen I was in total shock. I know my hearing has taken a beating over the years but this was the pits. Save your money."
2,disappointing,"i should have previewed the selections on this collection more closely. the quality of the recordings is fair to poor and the actual selections are uninspiring, considering the wealth of classics generated during this period of history. in sum, there are much better anthologies out there than this one."
3,Potting,This must be the soundtrack to a war. Lots of nice tunes that flows nicely with the famous pot.
5,He's done it again,"Edward Lucie-Smith is an accomplished poet, art historian and now demonstrates his skill as a brilliant photographer--the joy of the educated eye instead of the academically trained photographer is transcendent. This is a book to sit down with and linger over. The juxtaposition of classical statuary seen from a unique angle and men in unique postures is brilliant. The use of natural light transforms stone into flesh and vice versa. The shots of lovers in a pool--the abstracted lyricism is breathtking. Buy two copies because you'll want to share this book."
1,LIES!,The product claimed to have the Scantron answer sheet in the title when it really did not!! This is false advertisement!!!
4,"A little dumbed-down, but an important book.","This book was a required book for a sanitation class at my community college. Although some of the chapters are kind of silly (""The Safe Food Handler"" - don't pee in the food, wash hands at work, don't get hair in product), the book does go over all of the basics very clearly and informitavley. The text comes with a scantron sheet that can allow you to take a certification test graded by the National Restaurant Association. The certificate is a MUST when applying to kitchens and hotels. The book is a bit pricey for the information it carries, and if you do not need the certification for your job or education, consider buying the book in either an older edition, or used."
1,Garbage,"You get what you pay for. These are some of the cheapest, most flimsy, and poorly made plastic tweezers available. Half of them don't even align right at the tip. I don't recommend these. If you want ESD safe tweezers, I would recommend Wiha."
2,Needs to be updated,"This book may have been written on economically sound research for the late 80's or early 90's but it is sadly out of date as far as price estimates go; and that was the supposed idea of the publication. I could probably find a book about how to live on 5$ a week(in 1901) but that wouldn't apply to today.The recipies are well presented, and flavorful. But slapping a price per serving on at the end doesn't make it true, nor does it explain how to get shrimp and steak for four at 95 cents a serving. A little bit more sound reasoning and modernazation is needed."
5,Southeastern Mills Gravies,"These gravies are awesome! Plus, so much less expensive than if buying a gravy mix from the store, and they make about 3 x as much."
2,Gravy but not beef flavor,"This makes a thick not lumpy quick brown gravy. However, this does not taste a bit like real beef gravy. The only beef gravy I've ever found that tasted like the real thing is Franco American Slow Roast Beef Gravy in a jar (it used to be Pepperidge Farms)."
2,Generations just okay,"Animation is okay, not great, story isnt great, fight scenes arent great - if you love street fighter and follow the alpha story line this is a good buy, if youre looking for a good anime this isnt the best optionthe street fighter series has gone down hill from sf2 the animated movie to alpha to alpha generations"
1,"Awful, awful, AWFUL","I waited five years for this piece of junk? THe sotry was nonsensical/non existent, and the animation horrid. Also, what was up with the character designs in this film?I keep forgetting Ken was in this; he doesn't DO anything except react and make comments I'm sure are pithy in Japan.There was so little fighting in an anime based off a fighting game. There's just NO excuse. I actually started hitting FWRD on my DVD player to see if anything actually happened!Tekken the Movie was better than this, and read my review of THAT to see what I mean. Only Amazon's rating system prevents me from giving this NEGATIVE stars."
1,"i completly hated it, to put it lightly.","I just finished watching it. Being a die hard Street Fighter fanboy, I buy mostly anything that's Street Fighter related, that goes for all video games, movies, anime, cartoons etc. etc.Street Fighter Alpha The movie up to this point being the worst, and that said I hated it.However Street Fighter Alpha Generations in my opinion is one of the WORST anime's i've ever seen. IN My opinion even making the ""original"" Street Fighter Alpha movie look good. Was that there goal in the first place?Anyways wow did I hate Street Fighter Alpha Generations. I hated the story, I hated the character development... and if it hasn't been mentioned enough.. That art was completely disgusting... as well as the animation.ooh yeah and the fight scenes were vary awful too in my opinion."
1,This movie really does suck!,"The movie has a great story. Unlike Streetfighter Alpha the Movie, Alpha Generations actually follows the correct storyline. It had the potential to be a great movie, but there is to much wrong with it that cannot be overlooked that will irritate you immediately. The character design sucks(Why dosen't Ryu look like Ryu?), the English voice acting sucks(I recommend watching it in japanese with subtitles) and the fights suck. The only fight worth watching during the whole movie is Ryu vs. Sakura. This film dosen't even deserve a 1 star rating. I just gave it that because there's no way to go lower."
2,alittle weak,I wish this book could have actually said or revealed more. It was lame in information or supporting the plot of the book. This sounded like a wasted voyage of time and money.
3,Newport Tower excavation proves this book wrong,"In November, 2006, archaeologists hired by Chronognostics completed still another excavation of the Newport Tower. They came to the same conclusion as the excavation in 1951 by William Godfrey; i.e. it was built in 1650-1670, probably by Benedict Arnold's grandfather who owned it and claimed it in his will. So much of the book focuses on this that it is suspect in my mind. Additionally, the factual evidence on Sinclair having been in Rhode Island is meager, indeed. Dr. Diane Holloway"
4,20 stitches and variations,"I am a bit disappointed with this book sure it tells and shows how to make the basic stitches and then goes into a multitude of variations and combinations of those basic stitches. This is fine if you want ideas of how to use your basic stitches, but with a title like this I expected 300 stitches each unique and adaptable to circumstances. I guess my hope was a bit off. If you want lots of repeat stitches and like making doilies etc this is the book for you."
5,300 Crochet Stitches,"As a budding crochet designer I found this book very helpful. I bought a book called No Pattern Sweater Crochet at geezer.com and used 300 Crochet Stitches almost exclusively when making several sweaters. The 2 books compliment each other very well, and I've also used 300 Crochet stitches in several other designs. I found 300 Crochet Stitches very easy to understand and well illustrated."
5,Crochet lace,"I wanted to learn how to make crochet lace and tried working through a dozen or so different crochet books before coming across this one. The other books helped me master the simplest stitches, but I wasn't able to follow the descriptions to achieve my desire of making crochet lace. I'm pretty persistant, but I had been close to giving up and trying something else when I found this book.The Harmony Guides V6 and V7 start from the most basic stitch and working up, including stitches for all over patterns, and lace. Between the verbal descriptions, photographs, drawings, and diagrams I think everyone should find a descriptive mode that suits their way of thinking and learning.I'm not very interested in the all over patterns but it has plenty of crochet lace to keep me excited about what I will be able to do as I work my way through."
5,Exquisite,"Flipping through this book, lingering over thepictures... what a wonderful way to spendsome moments of your life. It's like lookingthrough an old family album; tender,endearing-- elicits lots of happy memories.Helps the wait 'til the next tour! :)"
5,Springsteen Access All Areas--great record of 1978 Tour,"Springsteen Access All Areas is a must have for the serious Springsteen fan, as a photo document of the 1978 tour, still widely believed by many fans to be the pennultimate tour of Bruce's career. There's also appeal here to the less devoted. While the hard core fans, and Backstreets subscribers may have seen a number of these photos before, many others will be unfamiliar with these, and thus will get a great look into the life of this fantastic tour. Recommended by this long time fan."
1,Bad Drivers from PowerVR,"Stay away from the new powerVR drivers - they crash the XP and it's hard to recover. Even the original Hercules driver is not so great, but better. It still restarts itself when pushed to work too hard, like watching a DVD or something. Otherwise it's okay. Use ATI or Gforce."
5,How To Direct a Musical,Sorry - but I sent a very positive review of this item to you over two weeks ago!
3,Not all that happy,"This is a great product for keeping your children off the internet! It definetly blocks their attempts to log on. When the do get on, I like the idea of seeing where they have been on the internet, so I can see what kind of site it actually is! It also seems I have to use the ""override"" fuction quite often when I think shouldn't have to! Other than that theirs alot of bells and whistles I don't know how to use or just don't understand how to use them."
2,Dull,"I watched this movie with my family, and found it to be dull. My wife fell asleep watching this movie. I do not suggest this movie."
4,Little-known Gem of a Movie!,"If you are a Felicia Day fan this is a must-buy for your collection. This was an enjoyable, fun movie - much, much better than I expected. It was definitely worth seeking out a copy!"
3,Felicia Day movie,I found this movie to be light and too cute. I've forgotten if there was any foul language but problably good for tweens I guess.
3,White Camellia fragrance nice however I found mine cheaper at,"White Camellia parfum is a wonderful fresh, floral fragrance,a very light, white-green floral/grassy smell--delightful, however I found mine Cheaper at thefragrancefactory.com"
2,music review,The music was upbeat and energetic--but after the first or second song they began to all sound alike. EVERY song was latin mambo type music and I thought it was way to repeatative. Needs to have an assorted mixture of music types.
5,20 inch??? look like 30 to me :P,"awsome display of colors and textures, one of the best things i bought last year... in front of you look even bigger than you tought.. It came with a dead pixel but i still love it..."
4,Great flat screen monitor,Great monitor. Only one problem each time you reboot the resolution resets to 1400x1050. Can't figure out why.
4,Great Monitor!!!!,"I purchased this monitor to replace my 17"" NEC. So far I have been very happy with it. I am using the DVI connector with my ATI Radeon XL1800 video card. It is working great with no dead pixels out of the box and nice clarity and brightness."
5,Great Performance and Value,"Exceptional resolution at a fair price, I am 100% satisfied with this underrated product."
4,"Bad Cover Art, Good Movie","I was surprised ... VOICE is actually a far more subtle, nuanced film than the bizarre cover art would have you believe. A fitting entry into the haunted school series that began with WHISPERING CORRIDORS, the film tells the story of Park Young-Eon, a girl who dies mysteriously. Her friend Kang Sun-min is able to hear the voice of her ghost, and together they set about trying to solve the mystery of her death.It's a surprisingly emotional film with a nice, creepy twist. Not the greatest J-horror film to be sure, but certainly a strong film with some terrific scares, a somber tone, and an ending that packs more punch than I expected. Recommended to fans of the more subtle side of J-horror."
5,Voice,"First-delivery and condition were excellent. For the movie, it is of a series of related flicks set in High School. Whispering Corridors started it off and it continues. The same story lines, done over and over again, but each time with a little tweek. Beautiful girls and bad men---the staple of Asian horror. Check out the whole crew of flicks. Momento Mori is the best of the group. It is an adult drama disguised as a High School horror flick.ENJOY!"
4,An ancient book but still applicable to modern life,"Code of the Samurai is a nice peek into Japanese culture, in under a hundred pages. It's amazing to see how such an ancient book can still be of use today, and how some things we consider 'common courtesy' have fundamental roots, and an actual reason."
3,Code of the Samurai:,"The book is explained in simple terms and gives the general concept of the samurai code; it is a very easy and quick read. It is not the best book on the subject, yet will serve as a primer on the subject. Good for begining martial art students to read."
4,good book,My 11-year-old son used this book as a reference on the basic history of the samurai. He enjoyed the book and I read his report and found it complete.
5,If we only lived this way...,i tell you this....READ this book...it changed my life from the day i got IT.........guru_219ps.....i'm a (GOOD) guy.....read it!
3,The Code of the Samurai,I found this to be an O.K. textbook on the subject. It seems just a little juvenile on the presentation of the information. You would be better served with another textbook on this subject.
2,Disappointing,Cannot see any great spiritualism here.Altogether a very disappointing experience.A Karate Sensei has far more to offer.
1,So disappointed!,"I was so upset after I finished reading this book. I wish it wasn't updated and they just kept it in its original version. If you are looking for a historical information of how the samurai lived and their values, this is the wrong book. Read Bushido: The Soul of Japan. The Code of The Samurai really felt like The Code of the Japanese Business Man."
5,The warriors way,"This is a great book whether you want to live like the Samurai did or your interested in a history lesson. I have been in martial arts for 14 years and i found several aspects of this book that will enhance my training, and just the general way I live my life. This is a must buy for anyone who is even mildly interested in the Samurai."
5,A Book you'll never get rid of,"If you have an interest in living by codes of conduct that are rarely seen in practice in the world around us, this is a good source to return to for reinforcement on occasion. I find it much more direct and humane than the Hagakure, and along with the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius and the Dhammapada, they are a great little library for personal reflection and moral guidance."
4,A good translation.,"A very good translation of the Bushido Shoshinsu.Much of what is writen in the book is compatible with todays lifestyle. As an apprentice in the martial arts, I can only say that this book gives some good ideas about the way of the warrior, bushido."
1,Good Brand Name - Flimsy Monopod,"I purchased this monopod because I have had good experiences with Bogen / Manfrotto tripods and trust their name. I got the monopod in today and there were several flaws with it.- Fully extended, I felt like I was going to break the thing just putting the camera on and a little downward pressure to steady it. It needs to be thicker overall, I think.- The rubber cap covering the screw is nice but it was really hard to lift it off. I had to use the screwdriver blade of my Swiss Army knife. The camera did screw on with no problem.- Then, finally, the strap buckle wouldn't keep the strap in a loop, but kept coming undone.I shouldn't have expected such a low-priced product to perform well. I was just really dissappointed. I'll have to save up my money and get a higher quality monopod later."
5,Great!,"Perfect for my son's sports events, makes the shot come out perfect and easy to use! I recommend this product!"
3,great bargain,"After shopping at many places that feature photgraphy products, no one could come close to the price I paid at Amazon. The quality was first class"
2,Too flimsy,"I've always purchased Manfrotto equipment with no issues, however, this monopod was way too flimsy for what I intended to use it for (sport / video) photography."
2,Clamp broke,"Initially worked fine. A bit to short for my 5'8"" height. Then a leg clamp broke. It's now worthless. It was never handled roughly. I have lots of Manfrotto gear. This is not typical Manfrotto quality."
2,Great Monopod until it broke,"I received this monopod as a gift in 2008. It is very light and suits me well. I used it on 5 or 6 occasions. However, two of the plastic tightening clips have broken rendering the monopod useless. The parts broke when I simply tried to tighten the sections the way it is designed to be used. I did not even force the clips.I have used many tripods in the past and had this type of problem on two of the cheaper models. I had anticipated that the Manfrotto brand would be a higher quality than the tripods that had broken in the past. After thinking about this, I have concluded that the plastic is not sufficiently strong to tolerate normal day-to-day tightening and loosening.The Amazon listing does not state the warranty of the product. I will request repairs from Bogen and see if they cover the cost of the repair."
5,Big reduction,"This is wonderful. I have 5 cats and now there isn't anywhere near the amount of litter kicked out. And the sides are high enough that my one kitty who won't squat to pee, keeps it in the box and off the wall. I think I may buy another one. So handy and easy to clean."
3,More Poems than Prayers,"I was hoping for more earthly, tangible prayers like being in the mountains, surveying God's handiwork, nature, the insignificance of man, gratitude and appreciation for observing wild things and wild places. More about the actual earth, rain, sun, sky and thankfulness for mans/womans place in it all. I didn't feel any of this."
5,Prayers we all need,"It's a constant on my night table, can put you in greatfull meditative state before drifting off to sleep... Beautiful!"
5,A support for daily living.,"This small book of many pages has multitudes of wonderful prayers for daily living. It is not only for daily living, but to give one a view of how others see prayer and use it in their lives."
5,Inspiring,I bought this book back in 1996 and continue to be awed by it. Only one thing keeps coming up. Some of the most beautiful words come from the Terma Collective and a document/book/work called The Box..Remembering the Gift. I would love to one day find out what the Terma Collective is and read the rest of this document.
1,Not my cup of tea!,"I had purchased this book as a reference for sacred space consultations, in particular with blessings and personal healing. I have since returned this book as I found it not very relevant to my purpose. The prayers are a wish washy and a more poetic rather than powerful."
3,when is a return not a return?,"I liked this work the least of all Conrad's writings I have explored. The man, 'left' by his wife, has such a tormented mind by what has happened. But for me it is so full of the mannerisms and conventions of a society that no longer exists. That society, if it existed (perhaps it could only have existed in England)was too noble, too pompous, too self-aware - as if any unconsidered step was poor form. And, indeed, Conrad, in describing the torment seems to me to be overblown in his dialogue and description - perhaps he understood it too; quite often he uses words like pompous rather than describe actions that demonstrate the pomposity. I did, however, like the idea of taking action, reflecting on it, and retreating rather than blustering on with a decision even when outcomes are poor. No good comes of it though."
2,Niche product,"The trouble with Iomega devices is that they are unitaskers. Each of them does a very specific job well, but don't try to use the product for anything else.I bought this as a gift for a friend who needed to easily backup his operating system drive, which was coincidentally 20gb. It does that and that alone. While he was moderately satisfied with the simplicity, as soon as his operating system drive outgrew 20gb, this device became obsolete. Additional 20gb disks are way too expensive to be worth adding to the system.If you're tech savvy at all, you're better off just buying a spare drive (and saving money) and storing your backups there."
2,Not enough on Dottie West after 3 #1 hits together.,"Come on, Kenny. You had 3 #1 hits with Dottie West. A #1 with Dolly Parton. A #1 with Sheena Easton. And your duet with Kim Carnes was #3. So...why is Dottie West so absent from this extraordinary videography AND from your 50th Anniversary Special??? Seriously???"
3,Kenny Rogers,This CD was purchased for a friend who really loves Kenny Rogers. I'm sure the friend is enjoying it very much. I gave it 3 stars because I'm not hearing the CD myself.
4,"A collection of ""El Rey's"" own.","This extremely gifted man is blessed with one of the most impressive, clear, wide ranging and powerful voices of all time. Still, altough an extremely prolific recorder of albums, he is not what one would call a productive songwriter. I am told there are some older Mexican music fans who do not care for Vicente Fernandez as much as some of his predecessors because of this fact.Although this point is hard to argue against, here we have a CD comprised of Vicente's own songs, and a very good disc it is. It does include perhaps his best known homespun tune ""Llaves De Mi Alma"" and a host of very fine songs that make for a nice listen.Not his best disc ever, but proof that ""El Rey"" can indeed write some strong songs and, as we all know, he can sing them like no one else."
5,Amazing,Vicente is timeless. His voice has an indescribable quality that must be heard. You will now be dissapointed with the purchase of any of Vicente's music.
1,top quality dung,"wow is this album horrible, in my 45 years of existance ive never heard such a horrid collection of music. Klaus wiese can go to hell, his music makes my head shrivel up. dont give this guy any money and buy his album. Im deep into yoga, and this album was recommended by a friend for my medition music. after listening to a minute of each of the tracks i threw the album in the fire place and laughed as it slowly melted away"
4,Good book. Funny and very well written.,"Good book. Took a few pages for me to get into it, but it won me over. I was afraid that it would be too limited an outlook, but the writer tells this familiar story so well that getting to the end was pure pleasure page after page. Loved the vicious portrays of the plastic Fire Island queens. With friends like these, you should buy a dog. Hope next time we get a story with a bit more range and scope; I think this author would be good company for a longer book. If I had the love life of the main character, I think I'd resign myself to life with a blow-up doll"
2,"Might have worked as a play, doesn't work as a novel.","Completely uninteresting story of ""Blue""'sheartbreak over Homer, someone the readerbarely gets to know and has no reason to like.Eventually Blue forgets about Homer when hemeets Teddy, another uninteresting and undevelopedcharacter. You can tell that it's true love because they say, ""I love you."" Occasionally funnybut never witty."
4,well presented book,"This book presents the winning works of those architects who have left their marks in the architecture world & as a consequence, been rewarded with the Pritzer Prize. There are a lot of beautiful & high grade pictures complemented by documents which are rather user-friendly to read. You don't need to be an architects or architecture students to appreciate this book. It deserves a place in your shelf or on your coffee table hinting to your guests what a discerning & sophisticated reader you are."
3,"A good book, a lot of creative puns.","This is an interesting book it has a good storyline for about the first 10 chapters, then it gets worse. The author used too much repetition and every time the Golem said something the author had to write at least a sentance to explain what/how/who he was talking to or about etc. This book has a lot of quick fixes and an extremely grueling end. The last 3 chapters talk about nothing but the golem and his girlfriend fighting over why they should and shouldn't become an item."
4,Grundy gets his Gears churning.,Typical fantasy quest in the style of Anthony or Pratchett with humor and surprises throughout. The saving grace comes at the end of the tale.
2,why so insulting??,"My 6 and 8 yr olds loved the Jump Start toddler. After that, the Jump Start games started getting really long intros and story lines that are unnecessary and BORING. We had to sit through why this mean girl wanted to hide things all over the castle. Each time we got to a game, she would say something insulting. Why??? We just wanted to play games. We put in the language arts challenge and did poorly on our first game because we didn't know you had to hit enter after you spelled a word. Yes, I am an adult helping! Ok, no problem, except as we were finishing that round, the voice said, ""The game is more fun if you do better"". My son turned off the game and asked me to return it.If we could get to the games, I think that they would be fun and age appropriate like the other Jump Starts. I wish more people made this kind of game and not just Wii, Xbox, etc."
2,Stay away from Gamma 4!,"This album is just plan bad. Not because it does not sound like another Gamma album, or because it is not hard enough, or there are not enough blazing solos, it is bad because it is simply a weak effort. The songs are anemic, the lyrics are lame, and even most of the performances are stilted. And yes, when a band reunites and creates something of a continuation of it's legacy, it should have some semblance of their original sound. This just comes across as an album for an albums sake. Uninspired."
2,very disappointed,"This doesn't even belong on the same planet as Gamma 3 or 2 (or even 1). Gamma got better with each release, until this one. Listening to it, I get the feeling that both Ronnie Montrose and Denny Carmassi have lost the edge they once had. (Where are the killer drum riffs Carmassi was known for? He became a wimp all those years he wasted his time playing for Heart.) The quality of songwriting and playing just isn't there. Sad, really."
4,Open up your mind and ears...,"Music is as personal as belly buttons. Therefore, it is almost impossible to say if a piece of music is good or bad. You may or may not like it but that is it!!!! Open up your senses and love this music.In this case, I enjoy this piece of music so much because it shows how great musicians and songwriters Gamma are. They evolve album to album without losing their esscence. They have horns and Edgar Winter!!!!!!.Do you understand that this is rocking???People, learn to enjoy music and life in general and your lives will be happier.This rocks period!"
3,4 out of 4,"Gamma 1 was probably the best effort of Montrose, the 2nd Generation. Resurrection Shuffle & These Hands are not good songs at all. Still worth buying though. Gamma 2 & 3 are a toss up as to which was better. This one is a distant 4th."
5,Not crazy...,"After all my treatments for breast cancer were done, everyone told me i should feel better-but i didn't! My feeling were much worse than i expected after so many months and i'm glad i found and read this book! It helped me understand that it is OK to have lingering fears and emotions and that it is normal-especially months after treatment! Maybe it's because she is a survivor too, that makes this book so great!"
2,Not what I hoped for......,"I found this book to be very depressing and dark. The author kept saying how cancer will haunt you the rest of your life, little hope to escape it, you'll just have to live with it. I've choosen differently, but this book was NOT helpful in my after treatment recovery."
3,A Guide to Mexican Art-Book,Book arrived timely and was in good condition. The book is being used by my son who is studying in Mexico this semester.
3,Breaking the Spell,"This book was well written but was rather repetitious. The author wants to study religion scientifically but doesn't yet have a plan as to how to do this. He is very well informed about biological research, perhaps less so in regard to the social sciences. He provided a lot of food for thought, and perhaps others will be able to move forward from where he left off."
2,"Not his best work, not by a mile","Dennett has moved from astounding philosophy of science to antagonism for those who disagree that the reflective person must dismiss religion as a belief system.The pretense, and first chapters of the book pull you in immediately, typical of Dennett. But half-way through the book it turns south, fast. Academic rigor is replaced with speculative condescension-a retreat into the ivory white tower remains the only rebuttal.The theme, the evolution of belief system and perhaps the evolution of causality in the human brain must be completed by someone less entrenched in the current cultural battles."
3,A much needed review of what religion really is.,"Dennett again contributes a heavy weight account, this time, of his thinking about religion. His view is heavily based on evolutionary analisys, both genes and memes. Entertaining and encouraging to open the Pandora box of ""breaking the spell""."
3,"Not ""Bright"" Enough","Dr. Dennett's book left a little to be desired. Can science study religion? Interesting topic indeed but Dr. Dennett in many instances took the scenic route to get to his points. Here are the strengths and weaknesses of the book:Strengths:1. Interesting topics2. Introduction of new ideas3. Well informed and intelligent author4. Good overall organization of book5. Makes good overall points6. The third of three sections was the best part of the bookWeaknesses1. It wasn't a fun, smooth read2. Took too long to get to points3. Too restrained, let loose Dr. Dennett4. Scientifically shallow5. Lacked convictionA mild recommendation. Slightly disappointed. In summary, Dr. Dennett claims that religion should be looked at scientifically and that it is no longer above criticism."
3,David B. Heart's response,"Anyone contemplating purchasing this item would perhaps benefit from reading David Hart's lengthy evaluation of it in the January edition of First Things. Hart is an Orthodox theologian and author of a truly splendid book, The Beauty of the Infinite."
1,tedious drivel,"Dennett is clearly blind to his religious committment (evolutionism) as well as the frequent contradictions in his reasoning. The book could easily have been condensed to a tenth the size, and would have been much less tedious as a result. Read it if you want to find out how Dennett thinks. Read something else if you want scholarship."
4,Simply Great,"Breaking the Spell is an excellent book. Contrary to a lot of other books like End of Faith and The God Delusion, Breaking the Spell is not an aggressive book. As a philosopher, Dennet simply asks the questions that everyone is afraid to asks, and explores them from different points of view. It makes you wonder whether getting rid of religion is really worth it, and how there are a lot of studies yet to be made in order to reach a conclusion.It might be a little too long for some people, I found that I wanted to finish it already by the time I reached the last two chapters. However, it is not a hard read, and Dennet takes you smoothly from beginning to end, giving clear examples of all his differente ideas."
2,endless meanders....,"This book was a big disappointment. As a fully persuaded atheist, the title of the book intrigued me but the substance just wasn't there. It begins with about a hundred pages of rambling where he ponders out loud endlessly about whether he should actually get to the point and then when he does he pretty much just re-states what is already well known and obvious to most reflective people in his own tedious, circumlocutious way and offers us precious little insight or interesting discussion. I think the rave reviews from readers here just reflects how desperate we secularists are for a voice to dispell religious delusions even where it falls far short of the mark of good work. This book desperately needed an infusion of substance, a good team of editors and some substantial re-writes. I have heard Dennett lecture before and been well impressed. Maybe he's just a poor writer. At any rate, reading this book was pretty much a waste of time."
1,Leave Religion to People Who've Actually Studied It . . .,"This book is a classic example of ""Identification of the Other"". Dennett's account of religion is about as reliable as a Nazi's account of Judaism or a fascist's account of democracy.Compared to his other books, it almost seems like he wrote this one off the top of his head. Either that, or he had research assistants who simply didn't know their subject matter.Sorry, but the book's really that bad."
3,"If you don't believe in God,","This book is based on the premise that God doesn't exist or else is completely disinterested in human affairs. If you accept this premise, the author is right: why be ruled by religion? If you believe in God and you understand what God demands from us, this book is ridiculous.So, why 400 pages on such a simple concept. It's a waste of time."
1,The Greatest Book Ever,"Wow. If you thought Feuerbach did a number on religion, just wait till you get your hands on this puppy. The inimitable dialectical acuity of Daniel Dennett is truly a joy to behold. I'm going to burn all my bibles and devote the rest of my life to preaching the gospel of Dennett, et al. The ideas in this book provide the rallying point for perhaps the most vast tranformation of human consciousness ever conceived. Free at last!(I would have given the book 5 stars, but the way I see it, a 1 is better than a 5.)"
1,A Manuscript for Morons,"A self-serving diatribe that attempts to prop up the crumbling notions of Darwinism and evolution fetishists by attacking religion. Interestingly, no mention is made of the fact that Darwin's bizarre notions were used as the ""scientific"" basis for forced eugenics in the USA, Nazi extermination of Jews, Stalinist gulags, racial discrimination and ""racial purity"" societies and the racist rantings of Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood and supporter of what she called ""Positive Eugenics."""
3,Religon,"This book is interesting, but I was hoping for more of evolution of faith (as in analysis of selective pressures) than the more general call to arms. He is too concerned what his acedemic collegues think, and that gets in the way of an other wise brave study of religon.It is worth reading, but not sure worth full price. He makes some interesting points."
2,Breaking the Spell Review,Dull reading. Author wanders off in all directions - takes too long to get to the point. Did not hold my interest. Needs serious editing.
3,What about religion?,"As usual Dennett has written an interesting book, about an interesting question. However, it is more a description of a research program than a substantial contribution. I understand his respect for the usual American thinking on this subject, but in this case I find it overcautious.He seems to assume that you either believe in a supernatural God, which he calls religion, or in a ""deepest ground of being"", which is essentially nothing. I think he should have given more thought on a third alternative, ""God"" as a shorthand notation of experiences of goodness in fellow human beings."
2,Kind of dry.,"I got this book at the same time as I bought ""The God Delusion"", and read it first and had to push my self to finish it before I started on the other. It was kind of dry, but did have its good points. I would recommend this book only if you have some free time and have read almost every other book."
2,Cure for Insomnia,"What Dennett and his anti-religious cohorts fail to do is entertain and engage the reader. Okay, okay, religion is a meme that highjacks the mind of humans in order to just be. Then he spends pages upon pages in giving purported anthlopoligical and scientific support for his theory. He missed the point early on - however, that religion serves the need of the human beast to simply overcome his fear of death. Like his cohorts, Dawkins, Hutchins, and Harris, he should read Ernest Becker. With that said, I am bleary eyed from reading his vabid prose and need some sleep - perhaps there I will be visited by my dead ancestors and form new religion."
5,Under a Spell,"This book really make pne think about how religion has been used by Europe as a tool of mass brain washing, especially to those of colour, to it to justifiy racism and slavery."
1,Get to the point,"I really looked forward to reading this book, but it took forever to get to any point. The first fifty pages could have been stated in one phase: ""We need to do research into why people believe"". As it is, it took page after page to tell that one thing.I must admit, I have not finished reading the book. There isn't world enough or time. There are much better books that make better use of your time."
2,An interesting critique of Dennett's book,"David Bentley Hart wrote an excellent critique of this book, which was published in First Things: ""Daniel Dennett Hunts the Snark"" --it can be found online if you google it."
1,Knocking down strawmen,"I couldn't finish the book, finding it too simplistic.I heard him talk about it last year and was eager to read it, but was severely disappointed. I'm one of those readers that he discusses in the preface as being ""disoriented or disappointed by the departure now know that I had my reasons""The essential caveat is: if you've liked his other work, don't be surprised if you dislike this one."
1,A Narrow View,"This book starts with the premise that a religion must have an ""agent"" between the human and sublime to be considered for this inquiry. By beginning this way, it is aimed mostly at those revealed religions with which we are all broadly familiar. But it misses considering the more subtle spiritual ways of life that appear in human activity through the ages - and never addresses the roots of religion that can be found in looking at the entomology of the word, which by many accounts is derived from the Latin ""ligare"": to bind (with the suffix re - to bind again). The book then goes on in a nearly endless explanation of itself, enough for me to put it down halfway through. If you want something critical of institutional religion's negative influences, read Christopher Hitchens."
5,"Finally A Book to Help Explain ""why Religion?""","This book fits my feelings about religion so it comes a no suprise that I enjoyed it. It follows the Baruch Spinoze idea of """"I have made a ceaseless effort not to ridicule, not to bewail, not to scorn human actions, but to understand them"". It is an attempt at understanding why humans seem to embrace religion. It is NOT about the existence of god, etc. It simply asks and attempts to answer the question,"" Why do we have religion?"" and secondarily ""Is religion a good thing for humanity?"". I think he does a wonderful job of exploring those questions. I think he is pissing in the wind a little when he presumes that a simple book might change humanity, though. It is a kin to asking ""Are bellybuttons good for humanity?"". Bellybuttons and religion both seem to be a feature in humans, for good or bad. We need to find a way to keep them both clean and keep them from getting infected."
3,Accurate perhaps but tedious in the read,"While Dennett, pursues some of the same area as say Jonathan Haidt does in the Happiness Hypothesis and The Righteous Mind, he lacks the presentation of the latter.This is a topic that interests me greatly and I have read extensively in the subject including other books by Karen Armstrong (The Case for God), Robert Wright (the Moral Animal) Mark Lilla (The Stillborn God), Dan Hamer (The God Gene) to name a few but halfway through this book, I find myself flipping pages. I'm beginning to get bored because this presentation lacks much of any sense of humor. He doesn't appear to have the ability to turn a phrase that makes it memorable. He seems to lack the ability to choose an apt metaphor to illustrate his points.I would recommend these other reads as far more memorable than this one.Allan Morgan"
3,Religion as a natural phenomenon,"The Author wrote for the US American readers primarily. I had wished he included a chapter or two on ""natural religious practices"".It opened my mind anyway."
4,Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon,Definitely a new perspective on religion. It creates a reasonable doubt as to the existance of one true religion on the Earth and makes me think of many more questions to ask. It is a good companion to Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces.I enjoyed the book.
1,"""Braking"" the Spell","I usually don't just read a book; I devour it, and one of this size usually requires a second highlighter and more blank pages than usually allotted at the back for my own index of quotable quotes. Alas, nothing memorable emerged from this exercise in self-indulgent wit. I'm completely sympathetic with the author's view of natural religion, but if I found this a burdensome, dreary read, I doubt any religious devotee would waste their precious time considering his argument. I have read previous work by Dennett that I thoroughly enjoyed. He must have been under his own spell when he wrote this monologue. If you are contemplating this one, put on the brakes and save your money and time."
1,smells funny,"I bought this for my 10 year old, and she's happy with it. However, it has a strange odor to it, like mold or mildew. Yuck!! It doesn't appear to have mold or mildew actually on it, but it may be hard to tell given the colors in the fabric, and I definitely agree with the other reviews about the poor quality."
3,Good buy,"Nice product but the handle is too tight, it will not fold all the way back and will wear down the corners. When trying to widen it the handle broke."
2,Sewing basket,Received on time BUTvery poorly made and I received it with the closure brokenI wanted to give this to my granddaughter for her first basket but I wouldn't never give anyone such a cheaply made item as this!Msladyjae
1,This is a bad deal,Very disappointed with the quality of this sewing box. The lid did not close properly and the piece of valcro that was supposed to keep it closed fell off almost right away. It is not worth the money I paid for it.
3,Good Starter Kit,"I bought this kit for my wife, and she loved it. She was basically storing her sewing stuff in a small box. It is not the best quality tray, nor the best quality sewing tools. But it's a nice starter package."
2,"Was okay for a while, but then handle broke","I did not have a lot of sewing supplies to store, so for me this small box was adequate.I really like the plastic tray on top, which has divided sections for organizing items.But had it for a couple of years, and now the handle has broken off. The metal pin/wire on one side has come out and I don't see any way to repair it. I'll go for a more substantial box this time."
4,sewing basket,I'm not a seamstress. Sewing is not my specialty.. but we all need to mend something now and then or re-sew a button back on.. This is the old fashion sewing basket like my Grammy had. I love it for all my sewing incidentals.
5,This writer is the real deal,"I love this type of book and I find this author very refreshing and original.I also recommend EVERY DAY A MIRACLE HAPPENS or MIRACLES OF THE SAINTS by Rodney Charles or Rodney N Charles. Both Published by 1stWorld Library or 1stWorld Publishing.The Second DeclarationEvery Day A Miracle HappensThe Secret Meaning of NamesLighter Than AirThe Devil's DiscipleLes Miserables, Volume I & IITHE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO Vol IIPUBLISH IT NOWBook Marketing Basics - The New Model For Promoting Your BookIllumination: A Gnostic Handbook for the Post Modern World"
4,Fascinating for the most part,"This book gives you real insight into Mae West's life and personality. While there are some errors in the captions under a few photographs, it is all well researched and very entertaining. I have read it more than twice..."
4,shore's donald duck,hi; this is a darling threesome for july 4th rememberance. great value for the size and money. it was prompt and in great shape when it arrived.
4,Jabra Products are great products,"The product I have works great, but this charger did not fit my bluetooth earpiece. The seller got it to me very quickly, but pictures did not show enough of the end that goes into the earpiece and I had to buy it to realize that it was not what I needed. I will buy from this seller again, but I will inquire about the product before I buy it if needed."
1,oops!,It was the wrong size and would not fit my bluetooth. I didn't return it because it would have cost me more for the postage than it was worth.
2,"Boring, vague, dry ... there are better books on patterns","My background: I am software developer with 8 years of experience. I bought this book because I hoped that it will be easier to read and understand than GoF book. Not so.This book is written in extremely boring style, with no explanation of what problems those patterns are trying to solve, bad vague descriptions, longish and unclear examples. If you need a ""bed time"" book that should put you to sleep it 5 minutes, this may be a right book for you.Otherwise, do yourself a favor, stick to GoF and Allan Holub's books. I have both and love them.I heard good things about ""Head First"" book on patterns, it should be most appropriate book for beginners.From my perspective, GoF is the best catalog of patterns, and Allan Holub's book contains a lot of ""thinking"" about patterns, problems they solve, good practical examples and opinions."
2,Get a different design-patterns book,"Good concept, bad implementation. After reading a few books on Design Patterns, I wanted to check out something else. Title of this book and decent reviews drew me in. I'm disappointed. After reading 20 chapters, I'm going to stop. I just don't feel the author is doing a good job. There is not enough explanation on the different design patterns. The author gives a quick overview and then gives you an example. There is nothing wrong with that. But it's very light. Each pattern is not explained enough. No benefits/drawbacks. No counter examples. Nothing really that will make the pattern ""stick."" I just can't learn anything from this book.If you're looking for a GoF book in Java, I would check out Design Patterns in Java or Design Patterns Explained. Not great, but I think they do a better job of explaining each pattern."
1,Disappointing and expensive!!,After the reviews 5* i bought it. I did not like the way the examples are set. Most of the time they are confusing.I would recommend reading the GoF book
5,I've tried others and the Austin AIr's the best,"I've tried cheaper air cleaners and they just don't keep my allergies clear like my Austin Air. The Austin Air does not require costly (and often difficult to find) filter replacements. Instead, you just vacuum off the surface and the machine's good to go for a couple of weeks. Think of it this way, if there's dust on top, you want to wipe out the vents.We had one incident with a bearing problem in one of our machines and Austin Air replaced the machine under warranty with us only being out the cost of postage. They're great people to deal with--friendly, helpful, and they got my machine back FAST during cedar fever season.Add to that, the white noise the machine generates is great to help you get to sleep. I'd highly recommend the Austin Air and will buy more as money and needs dictate."
3,Good intro to one wire and how it works,"I bought this book for a bargain price from one of the sellers on amazon. It has good information about how one wire sensors work. Also if someone is interested in Java this will break you into getting a sense of how that works. But there are some corrections that were made after the book was published, especially concerning how to list the onewire usb adapter. I had some problems getting it to work until I looked up the authors website and read some of the comments.All in all, I probably would not buy a one wire weather station again because there are other weather stations that give you a lot more features for the price. But I would get the very inexpensive one wire temp sensors to play with as an introduction to such devices.I did learn quite a bit from the book and am glad I understand what it takes to do java programming even though I barely scratched the surface."
4,Best of both Worlds,Bought this combination walker and rollator for my Father. He hates the idea of using a walker but he loves this one. The four wheels help him navigate rough surfaces better and the seat gives him a place to sit whenever and where ever he needs.
2,It works......,"This is the second one I have purchased, the first one lasted about a year and the motor died. They do what they say by supplying a slight ""breeze"" under your bottom and lower back.The straps are cheap and not sewn in very well. The motor is somewhat noisy, if you have a quiet car you WILL notice it. I drive a diesel truck and it's not too bad.This 2nd one I have does not seem to work as well as the other one and does not have the auto shut off. ???For the price it's worth it so you don't get sweaty driving long distances with leather seats."
3,Works...but not very comfortable,The seat itself works well. I would say the air could blow out a little stronger. I don't have AC in my car right now and it's about 90-100 degrees outside. It did offer some releif though. My biggest complaint is that it is extremely uncomfortable to sit on.
4,Uncomfortable comfort?,This item works but turns itself off at unknown times. It is VERY loud - wasn't as loud when I first got it from my wife as a Christmas present. When it was working it was great! Driving around in and out of the car in business attire it keeps me from being sweaty by the end of the day but it can rival the GPS in sound level.
5,Does what you would expect.,"Yes, it's a little loud when on high. Yes, it could be a little more comfortable. However, it works and you can feel the air movement. It's a good product. My third one over the years."
1,"Worked on the bottom seat, for a while","I bought this in late July, it really only worked on the lower seat portion, the back, not so much.Last week it made an awful noise and seized (early October)So I got less than 3 months use on a mediocre product that only delivered half of what it should have.It was a fun toy, but in the end, not worth about a dollar a day for its use....I would recommend that you try something else rather than purchase this thing....."
3,works but straps break,"I bought this because I travel for work a lot and suit pants = lots of sweat. The air on it works great. It will keep your butt, thighs and back cool and dry. The downside is that the straps that hold it to the seat rip off very quickly. I read that in reviews before I made my purchase, so I was expecting it. Luckily all my sitting has already shaped the unit so it seems to be staying put so far."
1,"Too little music, WAY TOO MUCH goofy narration!!!","I got this video at a music store. The narration is ridiculous - the reporter is not funny. Children do not need to be treated like they can't understand things unless there is a storyline going on. My 1-year old son likes the music and the instruments, not the actors. I could hardly watch the video to the end. I would not recommend this video at all.We also got the video on string instruments. It has the same ridiculous narrator, but there is more music and information in this one. My son likes to watch it and dance. However, I noticed he loses attention when the guy starts talking. He can point out string instruments he sees in books now. I would recommend this one over the one on percussion."
1,Just awful,This tape is patronizing and insipid; it insults the intelligence of young viewers. My 2-1/2 year-old grandson had the good sense to turn it off part way through.
5,solid and reliable,"Bought it 1 year ago, have been very happy, no problems, drivers always up to date on Hercules website. Nvidia drivers work just as well, you can choose either."
1,Horrifiying,"Dreadful, what gives this director the right to add characters, put in murders and make this opera his own. Shame on him. A director is supposed enhanse the creator's vision-not steal it. I won't be buying the rest of this dreadful ring cycle."
5,Musical Artwork,Had the opportunity to listen to all the tracks on this cd and Tomfoolio does a brilliant job blending different genres of music to make this eclectic masterpiece.
4,Easy to swallow,"The capsules are easy to swallow, don't kill my digestion and are overall what I hoped for. Will purchase again."
3,I'm Somewhere in the Middle on This One,"This record's got a pretty tight sound and I give it a spin every once in a while. ""Wild in the Streets"" is definitely the strongest song on the album, and while the others don't rip as much, this isn't a ""My War"" type case, as there are some nuggets like ""Leave Me Alone,"" and ""Trapped."" Not the greatest record ever, but I like it. It's fast and fun, but not to the point where I want to thrash my room, so... I don't know what to tell you. Good songs that leave me feeling like they should be a packed a little tighter, that's all."
2,The original version might get another star or two.,"Of the first three Circle Jerks albums (which are the only ones I 'take seriously' for lack of a better phrase) this is the weakest. I liked it a lot when it came out and I still do... I just think Group Sex and Golden Shower are stronger records, with better songs and better production.The real reason for my low rating is that this the remixed version of the album. It was remixed sometime in the late 80s or so, and the original mix has been unavailable ever since. The sad thing is, I don't think the remix is an improvement at all. The original version may have been muddier, but... well, it's probably just my own personal bias, but I think it was meant to sound that way. I really dislike this mix, it almost sounds like it was recorded live in a club. If you really want to hear this album, I suggest you find the original 1982 vinyl version."
5,Not a Sophmore Effort,"More than one person referred to this as a second outing for the band, did everybody miss wild in the streets and golden shower of hits?This is a 1985 record that came at a time when like one reviewer said it was time to continue growing.This is a good record, not great but there is some really funny stuff on here."
2,better buy Group Sex,"This album is really boring, after a great classic album like ""Group Sex"" this band turns some slow (I mean, compared with the first!) and for being honest...this cd is boring, except a couple of tracks but it isn't enough, they lose the energy of the first and I don't wanna hear next works. they did one classic and that's all."
2,Boring in the Streets,"What a weak follow up to one of hardcore's best debut's ever. ""Group Sex"" is so good, but the Circle Jerks could never duplicate the magic on that disc. This one starts off pretty good with title track and it also ends with two good songs. The only problem is that they are all cover songs. Sandwiched between them is mostly dull, uninspired rock. I really wanted to like this disc because it features the band's orignal line-up, which is my favorite, but I just can't. This used to be available on one CD with ""Group Sex"", but now they've been separated, so buy ""Group Sex"" and skip everything else."
5,5 years of hits!,"In 1997,Brian Littrell,Howard Dorough,Alexander J. McLean,Kevin Richardson and Nicholas Carter aka The Backstreet Boys were making young girls swoon with their hit songs. What you hear on the compact disc counterpart,you see,and hear,on this DVD. These teen idols put out four albums between 1997 and 2001,contractually. The only new track from 2001's THE HITS CHAPTER ONE is DROWNING. The BSB's female fans were admiring the group seeing and reading about them in magazines such as 16,Bop and Teen Beat. No Backstreet Boys fan should be without this item. For fans who don't own DVD players,there's always the VHS video."
5,Necessity if You're Operating Your Roomaid Regularly,"I think everyone needs an air purifier for city driving. I'm in bumper to bumper traffic at least 3 times per week and there's always at least one vehicle puffing out smoke. The body just wasn't designed for inhaling polutants from a tailpipe. I use my Roomaid in the car but had let it sitting dormant for a couple of years as I procrastinated buying a new filter. The new filters are better than the origninal that came with the unit. There's no compartment up-top that allows you to insert a scent module to freshen the air. That compartment was a weak-link, allowing un-purfied air to circulate through it. This new filter has made a big difference in my commuting. My Roomaid is always on and I don't get overwhelming chemical smells throughout the cabin of my SUV. Easy to install and worth every penny to me to keep my allergy symptoms at a bare minimum."
1,Bad for rabbits!,"So many rabbit food brands are bad for rabbits! Rabbits should not consume corn, seeds, and nuts! Just like humans, rabbits love to eat things that are bad for them. Don't shorten your rabbit's life."
1,worst sound card ever,Bought this soundboard to upgrade a computer with a built in soundboard. This boards sound quality was worse than a.m. radio. It also made loud pops when the computer shut down. I removed the soundboard and went back to using the built in soundbard. I also put it in another computer to make sure that it was not conflicting with something. Same story for the second computer. Sent it back to Amazon for a refund.
1,Horrible Customer Service,"Playback quality is very good; however microphone record is extremely poor with lousy volume response,and background noise. There is absolutley NO customer support available at the web site, and telephone support is only abailable 9-5 Eastren time which makes access difficult for anybody in the US who works a full time job. After leaving work early to contact customer support, the technician had no knowledge of possible causes or remedies, and had no experience with the MUSE XL. I was promised a phone call and/or email with further information. No word and that was over a week ago. I would NEVER buy a Gamesurround product again."
1,This thing is a piece of junk!,"Do not waste your time or money. If you have or plan on having XP, then keep looking. This card has been nothing but headaches."
5,"Loud and reliable, even in the rain!","I've used a few other whistles and none can compare to the Fox 40. It's super loud and reliable, even in the rain which we get plenty of out here in the NW."
5,The Best,"I now coach but I refereed HS Wrestling for 21 years. This is only whistle I will ever use. The Best ever. Good for any situation where you need a whistle. Keep one on your boat, simply the best."
1,"!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!! DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH LG OUTDOORS!!!!!! !!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!! DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH ""LG OUTDOORS"" !!!!","!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!! DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH LG OUTDOORS!!!!!! !!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!! DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH ""LG OUTDOORS"" !!!!!!!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!! DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH ""LG OUTDOORS"" !!!!!!!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!!

3,Almost too loud...,"I am a soccer referee and I am currently using this whistle. I am desperate to find an alternative. After officiating several games each weekend, I am plagued by shrill headaches and I have hearing problems for a couple of days. This whistle is almost too loud for regular use. IOW it is an emergency signal device and I think it should be used as such."
2,Not really a whistle,"sorry, but this whistle just doesn't cut it for me...it doesn't have that same satisfying whistle sound I grew up with...will it do the job, of course...it's comfortable in the mouth...but, I just don't like the way it sounds..."
5,Just what you think,"This whistle is exactly what it appears to be. A solid, dependable whistle. You can buy this with confidence, it works well and is not some plastic piece of junk."
4,Equal Opportunity,"I guess it is a hangover from my own mother, but I tend to prefer comics that do not use a great deal of profanity in their shows. That preference goes out the window where Ned ""Carlos"" Mencia is concerned. Carlos is a foul mouthed, equal opportunity racist. He has an opinion on everyone - and his expletive filled rants are the stuff of legend. Potty mouth aside - Carlos is not afraid to say what the rest of us are thinking. I still wince every time a comic uses awful language. It does not stop me from putting Carlos on if I need to laugh at someone that truly says what they are thinking........"
1,NOT FUNNY! Just Racist...,"I never seen a carlos mencia standup or his show before, so I decided to give this a chance. I didn't finish watching it. Not funny at all, just racist."
2,Disappointing,After seeing his stuff on YouTube I figured this new disk would have me in stitches. I fell asleep about half way through it. He is funny as first but then he falls into this racial and political rant that was just not that funny.
3,Ok book,Ok. I have read better books by her. The ending was very thoughtful. I was a good book and it read easy. First book I read ebook on my kindle.
2,Hate to join the critics . . .,"I hate to join the critics, but the tabs in this book are wrong. I haven't run into a song that is correctly tabbed yet. Portions of any song are correct, but never all the way through.I have found very little utility in the book because I always have to search for the correct instruction elsewhere.It's a shame because the idea of a compendium of songs is really appealing. Don't be suckered by your love of AC/DC. The idea of having it all will make you want to buy this, but remember, a lot of incorrectly tabbed music is not as good as a little bit of correctly tabbed music.Pass on this one."
3,it's a good start but...,"i have to agree with others so many tabs incorrect, but if what you are looking for is to have a head start and are a novice (like me) is ok, but you will definitivelly have to correct what you are doing as you move forward, which i find easy like in some chords the book shows one type of G and is a diferent type, but you end up correcting it on your own based on the songs progressions and that some chords just do not make sense, you will not find ups or down stroke instructions or stuff like that but again if you want to get a start and sound sort of like them you can use this, but if you want to sound just like them look somewhere else"
1,Mad Bomber Versus Mad Reviewer,"Are you one of the few who remember seeing this movie at a theater in '73 and have anxiously awaited its release on DVD? If you are, pick your three or four favorite scenes and then watch this Geneon (Pioneer) release. Guess what, they're not there. Where did they go, why they've been cut - cut - cut. So much for enjoying a rather obscure and perverse piece of cinematic history.Positives: 'The Mad Bomber' boasts a suprisingly strong cast for a low budget exploitation film which includes; Chuck Connors, Vince Edwards and Neville Brand. More importantly, it only costs $5.99 so you haven't lost much."
3,100% Weeeeeird!!!,"Vince Edwards is tracking a Mad Bomber (Chuck Conners) who can only be IDed by a serial rapist who was attacking a nurse while the bomber was blowing up a hospital (gee, sounds like a place my HMO would send me!).Not a great flick, but it has its moments... and it is weird!"
3,Cult classic,"Indeed, this is not a great flick, but worth it for its sheer bizarre quality. Chuck Connors freaks out following his daughter's heroine overdose death. He demands complete attention from his aloof waitress and when he doesn't get it, he really goes off. And beware the poor slob who throws his trash on the sidewalk."
1,Analytical/logical reasoning help? You won't find it here!,"I've wasted 10 of my 30 days to my LSAT with this book. 15 years ago I scored in the 97th percentile in the analytical reasoning section of the GRE - I say this only to show that I'm not incapable of doing logic problems. I expected the book to help me get my somewhat rusty mental processes back up to speed. Instead, I was massivly frustrated by their muddy explainations of practice test answers and total lack of help in choosing the correct answer. Explaining that answer ""E"" is correct, but not why A, B, C, and D are not and what tricks lurk in them is NOT helpful! Buy the Princeton Review's or Kaplan's LSAT book if you need logic problem help, not this dud. By the way, despite what every LSAT book tells you about visiting the test site and doing a practice test in the very room where your test will be held -- forget it. Security reasons prevent test sites from giving out the room number!"
4,excellent way to prepare in a short amount of time,"I should probably tell you that I haven't recieved my exam score yet. I found 30 Days to be an excellent guide to test content, and general question types. I completed the book in 14 days (all the time I had), and felt comfortable and confident in taking the exam. All of the questions types on the actual exam were explained in the book. If I were to suggest one improvement, I would include more full length practice tests."
2,Analytical part is awful,The explanation and examples of the analytical part are mediocre at best; the truth is that they are no help at all: they will merely confuse you more. However. the logical/reading comp. sections are not as bad.
4,A great look at St. Paul the Apostle,"First off, this commentary by Fitzmyer can be hard to read. Stick with it though and it will pay off. His writing style can be dense, as it is crammed with footnotes and is rambling. Once you get used to his style, you notice how great his organization and ideas are. Fitzmyer really puts forth some great insights, and anyone who has read Paul will find themselves nodding their heads as they go through the book. I had to read this for a class on Paul, and I'm glad I did."
5,Love this DVD!,"Great DVD! I really like this practice. As a former pro athlete, I appreciate a yoga teacher who knows what it means dealing with muscle tightness. As much as I find' hip openers challenging, incorporating them into an overall soothing yoga flow practice, they do wonders for my body... releasing the tension throughout. I like that I can do this practice any time I want from the comfort of my home. Thanks Stacy!"
3,Color and texture is very deceptive,"I added a photo to this product, and if you take a look - the photos in the ad are misleading as to color and texture. Other than that, it was very difficult to first get the boot on. I have a high in-step, so I'm used to this. It took about three minutes of tugging to get the right boot on, but the left one went on pretty easily. I don't know, but someone else may have tried that boot on that made it easier for me to get on. Once you get the boot on, it's pretty comfortable. I've worn about a half a day and while not used to boots, I'm not experiencing any pain. I expect them to get even more comfortable with wear, and I'm hoping the color takes on a more worn look instead of having a glossy finish as it does now with time and wear."
1,Size matters!,"The boots came to me two sizes too small- I've been wearing 8.5 boots for 30 years, normal width, but these boots couldn't take my foot if it were two sizes smaller! Yet this didn't constitute an ""Amazon Caused Problem"" so I got stiffed full shipping charges BOTH ways.Don't ever buy shoes from Amazon unless you can afford to pay LOTS of shipping costs just to find out what the manufacture decides is your size! In my case I guess that would be a men's 10.5 or 11 in triple E width!Also- their definition of ""vintage tan"" was more like a ""distressed mud"" color, not even close to the picture color. Once again- don't buy shoes/boots from Amazon!"
4,Cannot complain,"They are exactly as shown. Excellent and comfortable boot. Hard for me to get on/off because I have high arches, but otherwise they fit excellent. A good boot, no doubt about it."
4,rich girl,"CD was in excellent condition. Theonly issue was the final song, number four, was missing, but that was a manufacturing error."
1,"""Like an idiot on the roof""","""Rich Girl"" is Gwen Stefani's infamous rap/reggae version of a beloved musical number from the classic ""Fiddler on the Roof."" Gwen Stefani is great with No Doubt,with their pop/ska sound,but her solo efforts are left wanting. ""Rich Girl"" is the usual disposable bubblegum pop.Gwen Stefani does her updated take on the classic,as if dumbing down a classic makes it more attractive to the young 'uns. ""Rich Girl"" is an unholy blend of Broadway musical sensibility with rap and reggae,all making it into an awful glop. Avoid."
1,not convincing,"Bringing out some sort of ""Tribute to Paris Hilton"" song by simply covering an old song and giving a ragga feel to it - is SIMPLY BORING. So far Stefani did not convince me as a solo artist. it's all high marketing"
1,wouldn't purchase again,"There is very little contrast on screen, making words and letters hard to see. Also, most of the games move too fast for my pre-schooler, and hold absolutely no interest for my second grader. I wouldn't purchase again, even at Amazon's amazing price - sure glad I didn't pay $28 for this at Walmart!"
1,"LOAD of Crap, ... Highly Offensive.","I am Navajo and Comanche, Raised on the Navajo Reservation, So I can speak as this is supposed to be about me.Yes, I have read a copy. ... such as on page 26, the book says: ""Navajos hold their Farming and Grazing privileges by rights of occupancy"" - Which was NEVER true. The agency allocated areas.I equate this to, writing a book on the 1940s Racist Deep South with Poor, Uneducated, and Backwoods people and calling it KNOW THE WHITE PEOPLE.I will grant, generally there are a few truths, but very few.I would say, Message me if you would like to ""know the Navajo"". I will point you in the right direction."
4,Frank is back in hardcover!,"David Page has taken a different turn with his book ""Surviving Frank."" The book immediately takes a distinctive look at detective work from the eyes of someone who is not quite accepted in his community, but who is otherwise dedicated to his work.Frank's adventures and misadventures help us to look at a serious issue from someone who is really not that serious about himself. This approach not only shows us that we are all human, well except for Frank in a manner of speaking, but also shows that the unorthodox approach might be the best approach. Page shows this time and time again with his character development as well as his writing style.For his first novel Page has really opened some doors in literature. It's a good read for those of you who want a light read, some good laughs and a story which is most unconventional."
2,WHAT THE HELL DO WE HAVE HERE???,"I THINK THIS MOVIE IS REALLY RETARDED. IT HAD IT'S SICK STUPID MOMENTS. LOTS OF FUNNIES THOUGH. WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT I CONTINUED TO WATCH IT! BUT YOU KNOW HOW CURIOSITY SUPPOSE HAVE TO KILL THE CAT! WELL IM STILL HERE AND I THOUGHT THE MOVIE HAD SOME SHEAR QUALITIES OF IT'S OWN. IT'S A WEIRD ONE TO HAVE IN ONES COLLECTION OF HORROR'S BUT, FOR SOME REASON I HAD TO HAVE IT! A LITTLE BETTER THAN TEETH! BUT I WON'T GO THERE AGAIN. :-)"
1,Dimension Extreme's Eulogy,"you'd think that with all the success and money Dimension and other film studios have aquired from us over the years they would have high standards when it comes to even straight to dvd releases. ""Triloquist"", like most of the others, is just another example of poor product housed in enticing packaging. aside from being a boring and derivative film about a brother and sister going on a killing spree in the company of a wooden dummy, its comedic attempts fail to cater to a sense of humor inany form. the only audience that would find any of the jeuvenile dialogue funny are way too young to view this. and for what you would expect from Dimension Extreme, this film is bloodless, hokey and just plain awful. I sure hope the executives arent too shocked when theyre all out of jobs from flooding the market with dissapointing product and finding out that, yes, eventually we got sick of being had. avoid."
2,"Extra star just for the girl, worst movie ever otherwise.","There really isn't anything I can add to what has already been said. It was so horrible I almost died from it. HOWEVER, the main actress Payden LoPachin has to be the hottest actress I have ever seen in a B movie horror flick. Seriously, the only reason my friend and I continued to watch this movie after 15 minutes was because of her. YOWZA!"
1,"P.U. Not even bad funny, just stinks!","I love b-movies, and I love horror movies and I loved Leprechaun. But tongue in cheek gags, continuity, story line, gore, surprises, and even special effects are all pretty much missing from this stinker. It wasn't creepy. It wasn't offensive. It wasn't scary. It wasn't funny. It wasn't even unintentionally funny.It was boring. It was dumb. One star for the poor acting that took itself too seriously. That's it. I'll get more use out of this disc playing catch with the dog. Yes, seriously."
5,haha~,"this film is SO cheesy, the girls acting is very annoying. But, I do love this film simply because Rocky Marquette is such a cutie. I knew from the get-go this film would be silly because it is dimension extreme. But, Rocky's acting and his face keeps me entertained :) I like it, and I watch it when I am bored <3"
4,corelle tuscan dishes,"I am pleased with my purchase. The only slightly negative thing I can think of is that the color is a little muted compared to the pictures on the computer screen; however, this is my own fault for not shopping ""in person."" My family likes them a lot and we bought three sets so we would have plenty. Overall I would give this purchase 4 stars."
2,They hold food...,"They do hold food...all in one place. The shape of these plates is wrong. They are more like a large, shallow soup bowl, funneling your food to the center. They chip easily, and explode when dropped. Recently dropped a plate, and the largest piece left was about 1-1/2"" square, the rest was tiny shrapnel. Of course I didn't expect it to stay in one piece, but I think this shows how thin and fragile they are. Also, the leafy design around the perimeter is painted on top of the glaze and makes an irritating noise when scraped with silverware. As you can see, I am a guy who appreciates function. (My wife hates them, too). Just shows what suckers we are. Just call it Tuscan, Toile or Matelasse and we'll blindly buy it! Hey, at least the mugs hold fluids."
3,Poor Quality DVD,The DVD I received is of poor technical quality. One episode I cannot watch at all because the audio and the video are not in sinc. Other parts of a couple of the episodes have glitches in them. It's very disappointing to purchase a product and then not be able to enjoy it because of technical problems. I don't think this is a rare occurrence with the particular Wiseguy DVD I received. I had purchased the first 10 episodes (at a store) and had the same problem; almost half of the episodes were corrupted. I can only assume this relates to Mill Creek production.
3,Finding the lost episodes,"I enjoyed this, but missing episodes was annoying. However, you can find the episodes Dead Dog Records on youtube. The only one missing is 13 Dead Dog Lives. It is the first in the arc and I had no problem following the story because I couldn''t see that episode. Each episode is broken up into 3 or 4 clips. The video quality is typical youtube. The audio was clear, but often the words were out of sync with the lips. But, if you want to see it, it was the only option I found. Other site claim to have them for streaming, but none of them worked. I also believe I picked up a virus from on of the sites. Go to youtube and search for ""Wiseguy Tim Curry"""
3,A missing arc,Its a trip that I have to buy the dvd to see the Dead Dog Records arc. I wanted to watch it on demand but they don't offer it.
4,Still Holds Up,I just watched my DVDs and I have to say this show still holds up ever after 20+ years. I haven't seen these episodes since they first aired. Why Ray Sharkey was not nominated for an Emmy for his portrayal of Sonny Steelgrave is beyond me. If you haven't seen this show then I say buy it or rent and watch one of the most brilliant shows ever to grace our television screens.
1,"NOT FOR NOTHING, BUT...","You know, Wiseguy was a great TV show, not a good TV show...A great TV show, and I don't say that about many TV shows. Personally, I have always felt, that the power and the greatness of the Sonny Steelgrave story arc never was reached again, but I continued to be a fan of the show. I have been waiting so long for the Dead Dog story arc, that now I'm no longer interested, but it's not because the delay of the DVD. It's because of the missing original music, the lack of special features, and the lack of regard and respect, from the studios and the owners of the TV show. Before this TV show was released onto DVD, I had placed Wiseguy, on the mountain top of great TV shows, such as The Twilight Zone and Roots, but now, after releasing the poor quality DVD product of Wiseguy...To borrow a line from a episode of Wiseguy, ""Not for nothing, but this was a major disappointment."""
1,What a Disappointment!!!!!,"This is by far one of my favorite shows of all time! I taped every episode during it's original run, and eagerly awaited it's release on DVD. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! Music and scenes are cut, episodes are out of order and entire story arcs are missing! To make matters worse, I made the mistake of tossing out my VHS versions when I bought these, before I had watched them. If I could run to the dump and get my home made tapes back I would! I can only hope that these will one day be rereleased intact and complete, as they should be. If you love this show, STAY AWAY FROM EVERY VOLUME OF THESE DVD'S!"
3,"Great show, flawed boxset !","StudioWorks have done a great job with the release of the Wiseguy DVD boxsets.The transfers, sound,boxset presentations and extras have all been excellent, up untill now.As other reviewers have pointed out, episode 3 on disc 1 (A rightful place),is seriously marred by a very distracting shuddering picture in the opening first few minutes. You might expect this from a burned copy but not an official release!The two bonus episodes don't have the option of viewing without Ken Wahl's commentary,which while entertaining is surely a serious oversite.These Wiseguy episodes may not have the depth or revolutionary impact of season one, but they are still streets ahead in terms of performance,writing and production values than pretty much anything around at that time.I agree that Studioworks needs to look into these issues on this boxset and rectify these problems ASAP."
3,Not their best effort....................,"These are a mixed bag. The arc involving the garment district had a great bad guy in Stanley Tucci, but Ken Wahl's leg injury took him out of the series and prompted a radical re-write of the script. Enter a new agent. I could not get into it and abandoned the show for a few weeks.The ""Pilgrims of Promise"" arc was weak as well. Fred Thompson is a good actor but not enough of a draw to fill the void left by Kevin Spacey or Ray Sharkey. If you contrast this with the first season of Wise Guy there is such a huge dropoff in the villians.I plan to buy the DVD, warts and all."
5,Right up there with The Sopranos!,"Wiseguy season 1 is fantastic..Ray Sharkey plays Sonny Steelgrave and is just awsome, the way he acts and the things he says are great..Ken Wahl does a great job as the main person ""Vinny""...Great story all the way to the end, it was a show that I did not want to end, but as it did, the way it was ended was perfect!! Do your self a favor and pick this boxset up."
2,Great episode - why can't we get it without the commentary?,"This episode was one of the better ones in the series. Customers need to aware the episode comes only with Ken Wahl's commentary. His insights notwithstanding, I'd bought this episode with the hope of hearing the dialogue and to be able to enjoy the acting - which is outstanding. After downloading all 58 episodes available, I've found this one along with the episode titled ""Sleepwalk"" (episode 5 of season 3)are both with the Ken Wahl commentary. Why can't we get these with the original dialogue? This is an option you want in a boxed set, not an episode download."
3,THey know better,Without the music or closed caption this does not rate a permanent place in my library.
3,Wise Guy,"I bought this as a gift for my father. I've only seen one disc of it my self. So far it's about an undercover cop in the mob, and no one but his brother knows he's undercover. It was made in the 80's. In my opinion, it's a little slow, but it did just start."
2,What happened to the Dead Dog episodes?!,"As much as I like the ""Wiseguy"" series, I was dismayed to find that all the episodes with Deborah Harry were omitted from the series on DVD (8 in all, I think), and the whole Dead Dog Records bit is skipped over. There are references to Vinnie's involvement with the record company in the first episode on this set of DVDs, but it leaves a new viewer (my wife) wondering what's really going on. I am really disappointed by this, and it detracts from the rest of the series released by the studio. Boo!"
2,Where's the Dog?,"I am too displeased at what's missing to comment on what's here. Deborah Harry? Glen Frey? Where's Dead Dog Records? This is a cold reminder, not unlike a ""greatest hits"" record that contains some out-of-touch record producer's choices of what the public would like to hear, that we can't count on quality programming from a Hollywood movie marketer. *sigh* Why was I even hopeful? A real shame....."
1,Defective discs...BEWARE!!!,"First of all, I loved this show when it was on so I was really looking forward to getting it on DVD. First DVD set had problems right from the start. The first disc vibrated my DVD player so much that it shut itself off. The third disc was no better. Got the set replaced by Amazon and encountered the exact same problems. I don't know if it was caused by off-center labels or whatever, but I have to give up on this. Poor quality..."
5,Good Place to start if you've never seen the show,"Before cable started making shows with fewer episodes than networks, WiseGuy was trying to use this format with 'arcs.' The advantage is that a more complex story could be told without dragging it out to fill the season. It also kept the show fresh for a long time.I find the Sonny Arc the most compelling. Right away you can see that the show presents no easy answers and the line between right and wrong is blurred. The characters are charismatic and the story unfolds naturally. In later arcs there was more of a tendancy to use shock value. But the first few episodes were more character driven and made use of the tv format. If you don't want to commit to a whole season, just watch this arc and you'll get a taste of what's right with the whole show."
2,Terrible quality control,"Thinking I had a bad disc due to the third episode on disc 1 shuddering along, I exchanged it for another...same problem. So it looks like everyone has the same badly recorded disc. Looks like a recall is in order here for this sub-standard product. What an injustice for such a great show.No wonder people are downloading copies of everything off the 'net for free. If this is what you get for your hard earned cash then I have no sympathy for the recording industry crybabies.For those who are wondering about the missing arc, I read somewhere that the ""Dead Dog Records"" arc was postponed due to licensing issues with the music in the episodes."
4,LACK OF ORIGINAL MUSIC HURTS,"This show was way ahead of it's time and cast perfectly. The first season's two arcs stand up to ANY mob-related story ever put on film. I was a huge fan and could not wait to purchase this DVD collection, but when I read that they would not spring to pay for the music used in the AWESOME climax, I lost interest quickly. Ken Wahl explained on www.kenwahl.com (before it went AWOL) that the producers thought it was too expensive to use the music, yet the charged more for this DVD box set than any other similar set. It's almost like they decided to double-whammy the fans by not paying for the songs, but making the fans pay more than usual. Thanks, Steve C!!"
2,Who Should I HATE????!!!!!!!!,"Should I hate the Moody Blues for being greedyand not allowing ""Nights in White Satin"" onthe DVD---or should I hate Stephen J. Cannellfor being tooo stingy and not paying the royaltyto include that song??????The scene between Vinnie and Sonny in thelast episode loses all its depth and powerwithout the song.I loved the show--I hate the DVD"
1,Will it be the original cut broadcast on tv,"When originaly released on DVD the Sonny close was changed and two songs were removed from the broadcast. Will it be the same on this new release. I know it's hard to pass up a good deal like this, but I remember seeing it when it aired on broadcast tv, and the songs fit perfectly with Sonny and Vinnie. Will be very disappointing for those great songs to be deleted from this set again. Does anyone know if they are the original, unedited versions ?"
5,Genius! Brilliant!!!,"So many people never even saw this series. You thought the first season of ""24"" was good. I did too but this has it beat. Ken Wahl & Ray Sharkey. I guess we'll eventually get to Kevin Spacey & William Russ. An amazing year one. Then there's Stanley Tucci, Jerry Lewis and Tim Curry to look forward to but the first year was the best."
4,Does It Include Mel Proffitt (Kevin Spacey) Arc?,Box says COMPLETE Season 1. Picture only shows Ray Sharkey.Spacey appeared in the 2nd Arc of Season 1. I wonder if the Spacey Arc will be included?
5,My FAVORITE cookbook,"I regularly look on any site for good/ or perfect copy's of this book to give to friends as gifts. Ken Frank is a great chef and since he hasn't the time YET to write a new book this one is a classic. He worked his magic in Los Angeles for more than twenty years and moved to Napa California more than ten years ago, and has Now opened his third La Toque in the Westin Verasa this past year. I am looking forward to visiting his new establishment"
2,Careful if you hope to get as expected in continuous length,"I'd noticed other reviews of exercise tubing in which some folks got the stated length but not as a single piece. This company is also apparently doing the same. I was hoping to get the 25 feet as a single piece, not as the 11 and 16 feet chunks I got (and I don't consider getting a bit 'extra' any bonus). If you order 100 ft ...what do you get ten 10foot pieces. Not completely truthful in my opinion."
4,Only one small complaint.,"The yellow tube arrived on time and in one piece. I use it for slingshot rubber, and it is very good for that purpose. It's also great exercise tube, but I prefer Green for that purpose. My only complaint is that the package was twice as large as needed. This is no problem for people who live in the US, but I live outside the US and use a freight forwarder. I pay by weight or package size, whichever is more expensive, and air in a package can cost as much as product in a package."
2,This product is mislabled. The extra heavy should come in black tubing.,"This product is mislabled, The exta heavy should come as a black band not blue. I made an order for heavy bands (blue) and also for extra heavy bands (black). But what I got were 2 boxes of blue bands both the same strength."
4,Seems like a quality product,"This turned out to be a much lighter resistance than I was hoping for. It is however it is a quality product that should last a good while, be consistent and free of defects. I did not find an actual weight resistance rating for the item, just measurements and the relative strength rating of it's being their 'Super Heavy' offering."
4,"Good, innovative workout","Over the years I have used so many of Kathy's workouts I can't even count them. This workout is another great one by Kathy...I truly enjoy it, and her back-up cast is good as well. It's easy to learn and is a good solid workout. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that Kathy herself acts a little odd. She is normally so composed and classy, and I just feel in this workout she acted a little, I don't know, silly I guess is the word. Her instructions were clear as always, but her actions & occasional yelping get to be a little distracting. However, it is a good enough workout to make it worth overlooking the few times that happens."
1,Disappointed,"I was enjoying this workout and working up a good sweat and then....too bad they had to start swatting flies. That move completely ruined the workout for me. I could get past the flashing lights, cowboy hats and people being superimposed, but at 41 I can not swat flies during my workout. I normally love Kathy's workouts and am sorry to have to give this a bad rating."
2,I didn't like this walking workout; I like Leslie Sansone's tape much better,this workout didn't impress me at all....I didn't like the whole clock idea and I didn't like how it changed scenes--I have just started doing Leslie Sansone's intermediate and intermediate/advanced tapes and I like them MUCH better!!!!
5,Great Workout,"This is a great workout, it might be a little different from your normal everday ""old"" workout but that is what makes it fun :)"
1,poor quality and annoying to watch the screen,"I have several of Kathy Smith's excercise video's. I work out almost every day and use a different excercise video from Kathy and many other fitness people, so I have a large collection. I bought this one in a $2 bucket at Ocean State Job Lot, watched it this morning and was shocked at how badly it was produced. The screen/scene changes and flashes, zooming in and out quickly, makes the people on the screen look out of proportion, and is extremely annoying to watch. After using it once, I have no interest in using it again. The workout itself was pretty bad as well. She must have been having a bad day, as her comments are dumb, and everything about it is just poor quality. No wonder it was on clearance at the store."
2,Walk for weight loss.,"I got this to switch it up from Leslie Sansone (who I think is great)...but was a little disappointed, not the worst but a little bored with it....I'll stick to Leslie Sansone...."
3,"Poor production, good workout","Kathy, Kathy, Kathy, what were you thinking? I am a huge Kathy Smith fan and have almost all of her DVDs. This one has amateur production and choreography and incredibly hokey outfits. If you can get past all of this, the workout itself is solid, though boring at times. The Matrix method is wonderful and you can tailor this workout to your fitness level."
3,way to cheeeeesy,I thought this was a decent starter video for walkers. If you can get past Kathy trying to act like she's 18. She gets confused about direction at some points and gets way to exited for my taste. I prefer Denise Austins walking video and Leslie Sansone's series of videos. But Kathy you look awesome for your age!!
3,"A stretch to be classified as a ""walking"" workout!","I really have two complaints with this workout. First, it truly is a stretch to call this a walking workout. If you're at all used to Leslie Sansone videos, you will NOT be getting what you consider to be a ""walking"" workout. This is far more aerobic-esque and dance-ish. Second, there are numerous spots in the video where the beat and the steps simply don't match up. I would argue that the music was poorly chosen, as it even appears impossible for Kathy herself to follow on a beat. I think a young teen would like this video, but it won't make my rotation...which is disappointing because I actually like several of Kathy's other videos."
2,Matrix?,"After Christmas I purchased several DVDs in an effort to add variety to my walking routines. Of the DVDs I purchased, this is my least favorite. I found the matrix thing gimmicky, and ineffective. Perhaps I am just a klutz, but also found that many of the ""steps"" were impossible to do and added nothing to the workout. The background was beautiful, at least at first, and the people in the DVD were too. They seemed to have no problem with the steps, but that did not help me. There were other ""gimmicks"" with the background, such as putting it on a billboard, side of a train, etc. As you can tell, I got distracted by elements of the DVD which did not add to the effectiveness of the workout. I do not use this one and feel it was a waste of money. Nice location and hat."
1,"Very Disappointing, Especially if You are a Kathy Smith Fan","I've used Kathy Smith's videos (step aerobic, weights, dance) for over 20 years, so I was excited to get this one. What a huge disappointment! The set is absolutely ridiculous, with fake scenery in the background. UGH! Worse still, the moves are dull, dull, dull. As much as I am annoyed by Leslie Sansone, I have to say that her walking videos are much better than this one. Don't waste your money!"
2,power walking...,"THis video was too hard to keep up with guide. It is not your ordinary ""walking"" video. It is too hard for beginners."
1,Just plain silly,"This workout is just dumb. The cuing is awful and the set is worse. The only reason I bought it was because it was cheap, but it is seriously so ridiculous that I couldn't even finish it once. If you want a great walking workout look for Leslie Sansone dvd's."
2,Not my favorite Kathy,"This exercise program is somewhat disjointed and hard to follow. Scene changes from Kathy to group and back. Blue-screen background; changes are distracting, and costuming is ridiculous. Some of the moves are a bit hard on the knees. I count on Kathy Smith's workouts to have a standard of quality in production as well as workout effectiveness. This one was a disappointment."
3,Kathy Smith Power Walk for Weight Loss,"It was different. It was a good enough workout, but I found it hard to follow the way it switched from live people, to Kathy working out in front of a green screen with her walkers projected on the back of it. If I had been able to preview it before I bought it, I would not have bought it. I'll stick with Leslie Sansone. Really distracting."
3,It's a beginner's textbook,"I ordered this text for a class, a graduate class, and although I think it is a fine introduction to Statistics it should not be the text for a graduate level course. If you have never taken a Statistics course, and you find yourself having to take one in graduate school this would be a good text to prepare you for the course."
2,False sale,"The book itself was in great condition and was the edition I needed for my Social Stats class, but did not come with the CD I needed for the class as it said it would when I ordered the book. I ended up having to pay $20 extra dollars at the university bookstore to get the book with the CD on time for class because with having to ship the original book in, wait for a refund and re-order the book not knowing if the CD would be with it this time would have put me behind, thanks amazon!"
4,Kindle version and pagination,Does anyone know if the Kindle version follows the same pagination as the printed text? I want to use this for a class in which the lectures reference page numbers. I need them to match. Thanks for any help before I order.
2,Back in the High Life - Live,"This is a big disappointment. While the music if fine, the video production is not good. If I had the opportunity to preview this product, I would not have bought it."
4,Pretty good =),"This seat is great for a light weight booster chair that keeps the seat belt in place (across his shoulder) and is VERY easy for the child to get in and out of. The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because the back of the seat is SO light weight, that sometimes when I am pulling the seat belt across my child, the seat belt will tug on the back of the booster and move to the side slightly. This happens when my child does not have his back completely against the back of the seat ... when he is leaning forward to look out the window or something."
3,This does NOT have side pillows,"Overall this is good seat. It is light weight and seems pretty sturdy. However, the turbobooster comes in many models, of which it is difficult to tell the subtle differences. I bought this one because the description says it comes with the Gracopedic luxury foam on the seat and padded side pillows. But contrary to the item description, this does not come with the side pillows.Babies R Us offers similar models with both the upgraded seat and side pillows--they are called Abbey or Roanoke. This is the only model that comes with the neck pillow."
4,Good product,The product arrived on time and felt that it was more than safe for my grand daughter and a fair price.
4,wish I had it,"I saw this movie a long time ago, I wish they had this on DVD, and had special features, that would be great."
3,A Brisk and Pleasant Read,"A picaresque adventure, starring a demon summoned by a wizard. While called a demon, the main character and first-person narrator is more like an alien than a demon, having few of the attributes we traditionally mean to invoke by using the word ""demon;"" in fact, the demon is more decent, honest and intelligent than the human beings in the story. In fact, the book, in addition to being a sort of light-hearted sword and sorcery adventure, is a satire of human greed, aggression, racism, etc. The satire is not particularly funny, nor is it very eye-opening (haven't we all heard that war is bad, greed is bad, racism is bad, etc., by now?) but the jokes are not so bad, nor the social commentary so preachy, that it is distracting or off-putting. A brisk pleasant read, neither anything special, nor a waste of time.I read the 1973 Signet mass market paperback, with the blue-green cover and the ad for Roger Kahn's The Boys of Summer on the back."
2,NOT AN 'ALL STAR WESTERN' DVD,"I cannot really complain, paying only 5 bucks plus for this DVD, however, any prospective buyer should be aware that the 4 films included vary in their clarity.One thing in particular, concerning the John Wayne SAGEBRUSH TRAIL, the original sound track, at least on 'my' DVD, has somehow been overdubbed with voices that ARE NOT the original actors/actresses. You will not hear John Wayne's voice on this one, close but no cigar. I have another copy of Sagebrush Trail and the original soundtrack is there, so why on this DVD, the decision was made to re-record I have no clue.All-in-all for the price, the DVD is passable. The Allan 'Rocky' Lane movie, King of Texas, is very clear, but the other 3 are below that quality. But again for the money it might serve some viewers.Semper Fi."
5,A great time-passer for your little fantasy lover,"I bought this a few months ago for my (nearly) 4 year old daughter. She loves it! It's one of those toys she comes back to again and again, sitting down for 15 or 20 minutes at a time. She loves to rearrange the stickers on a page, or decorate a page she hasn't touched before. The stickers are beautiful and so are the backgrounds. And I love to hear her sit and make up little stories as she plays. It's been a great imagination tool. One hint for parents of younger kids... pull all the white backing off from around the stickers. This way its easier for the kids to get the stickers off without tearing them."
2,"Fairly entertaining, but stickers rip","We bought this used, so some of the stickers were used too. But even the stickers that hadn't been used weren't reusable as claimed. Whenever my daughter tried to peel one off and reuse it, it tore or didn't stick again, so she only played with this once or twice. The pictures are pretty though."
2,Stickers don't stick.,"The pictures are pretty, but the glue on the stickers doesn't work very well. (It's sort of like the glue on a post-it, without being as effective.)My little girl (four years old) gave up on the book because she was so frustrated with the stickers not staying where she placed them."
4,Today's Holden Caulfield...,"The main character in this book is a seventeen year old named Quinn Marshall. He is the 21st century version of Holden Caulfield - a bright, perceptive kid who uses most of his abilities to convince the rest of the world that he really doesn't give a damn.Enter Joe Toscano, a retired Marine who can see through Quinn's false bravado and gives the teenager a chance to prove he is something other than some stereotypical, rebel-without-a-pause seventeen year old. In the process of giving Quinn these life gifts, Joe also seeks to quiet some ghosts from his own life.There seem to be precious few books these days that take the time to develop characters - the kind a reader can really care about. This is one of those few books. If these types of reviews don't typically move you to buy the book, make this your one exception. You won't regret it.Oh, and be sure and BYOK (bring your own Kleenex)."
5,girlfriends a great tv show,i bought the dvd set for my wife. we have seen the show on tv but not all of them. cant wait for the rest of them.
2,Not what I was looking for,I was looking for more of a resource for making this trip. This book went into more depth about the history of the region than the specifics of the trip. In general I was pretty disappointed with it.
1,No Veves or Diagrams in this Book,"I waited many months for this book to come out, and I still believe it has much valuable information, but not one drawing or chart was inserted before printing. This makes it useless and not worth the money. How can you work a magical system when the printer omitted the most important part of the text?I'm really disappointed."
5,"great, affordable cat litter","clumps well, absorbs odor. no complaints! and delivery makes it even better since I live in a city where car ownership isn't common."
1,Showed up leaking out of the box and half gone,This product showed up leaking out of the box and much of it was missing. I didn't bother opening it all the way up I just taped it securely and left it on the step for return pickup.
2,Not impressed!,Did not block any odors! I'll stay with other reliable brands like Scoop Away or Arm and Hammer. Even the unscented works better.
3,Not bad.. new cat owner,Not as dusty as some of the other brands I have tried.. Still a bit though. Also a little expensive.
3,I've tried better,"I decided to try this because of the reviews (and my normal litter was back ordered). It's a fine litter, I suppose. It's better than Johnny Cat or Scoop Away. I clean the box twice a day...and the smell from the clumps is pretty strong. At this point, I think Ultra Pet Better Way litter is a superior litter."
5,Best Litter I have ever used -,"I was using Ever Clean litter and it never clumped as tight as this product does. When I would try to scoop up the urine along the wall of the litter box it would crumble and most of it was stuck to the litter box. That started to aggravate me more and more each time I had to clean the litter box.I never heard of this brand but I read a few reviews and I thought to myself, I am going to give this a try. So I bought one 16 pound jug and its been a week and I couldn't be happier. I have two cats and the clumping is absolutely awesome. No litter has been sticking to the litter box, no crumbling when I scoop up the urine. No more clay smelling litter and very low in dust and tracking. I have found a product I felt I wanted to share my experience with. THUMBS UP!!! Highly recommended whether you have 1 -2 cats or even up to 5 cats :)"
1,Only received one of three jugs,"The litter itself is just fine, however, I only received one of three of the jugs I purchased. When I only got one box I assumed that the other two would be coming in a different box and used the litter (I know now to not do this as it is now Un-returnable). There doesn't seem to be a way to try to get the other two jugs of litter from Amazon, as that would be the best solution. Instead I have one very expensive jug of cat litter that seems to work fine. I'm dissapointed there is no way to remedy this."
1,Pack of 3?,"This was supposed to be a pack of 3. I have only received one, not three! Still waiting for the other 2."
1,A ho hum movie cliche about a fictional tribe that never existed,"Too bad good actors were wasted on a bullspit fantasy script. While the press touts this as being about the ""Black Paw"" tribe of California, NO such tribe ever existed, and IF this is supposed to be in California, why are the ""Indians"" dressed in northern plains (Lakota) style...???This movie is NOT fact based, so view it in that context..."
5,Griity Western Gem!,"A very surprising find, which should have had a national big screen release. Realism is reflective of films like Unforgiven, Man of the West, etc. Classic, scenic and riveting! Hopefully, they'll consider a sequel....."
5,Yellow Rock,"This is an excellent movie, filled with action and adventure. A classic Western..with great performances...especially by Native American actors...the Spears brothers, Michael and Eddie. Highly recommended!"
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I have to admit when I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought I would like it, but it was not as good as the other ones that I have purchased. I like Michael Biehn but I have seen him in better movies and TV series such as the Magnificent Seven."
5,when your ready for someting better....,"kids, odds are you have some musical class, come on guys the OC punk ska deal is cool and all, but when your feet are ready to bounce instead of run into someone in the pit...check this CD out its a traditional ska album, the kind of ska thats tough to hear on the radio cause its slow and associates itself with jazz and reagae instead of skas associate punk, and like the titile says, ""its right on time""... so when your tastes buds are looking for a change check it out, odds are you'll like it...max"
3,At worlds end?,"I received this as a christmas gift and thought ""rock on!"" however, what they don't tell you is that it is harder than one would think. After mos. of playing and flailing my arm around like a nutjob...I still can't get past the level that takes on the black pearl...as it were, it is still fun, if not a little bit frustrating."
2,Disspapointing,This one seemed to have a lot of potential. Using the Wiimote to control the sword seems like a good idea..until you play the game. All that swishing plus the missed swishes really ads up to a frustrating experience. I had this one for about a week before it went on eBay.
1,Not a very good game,This game is not good. First there is really no story or anything. You just jump from one fight to another. Also the controls for it are terrible. Do not buy this game. It is terrible. I rented the game because I had heard it wasn't good. It isn't. It sucks.
4,Wife loved it!,"My wife is a huge fan of the entire ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, so we rented this game from the local Blockbuster and she fell in love. We ended up purchasing the game from Amazon.Gameplay is exciting, it's neat being able to wave the Wiimote like a sword and interacting with the various characters. The story line follows the movie fairly closely, and the ""mini games"" like Pirate Dice only add to the enjoyment! After you've played it a few times it may seem like the gameplay is a little short, but you have to remember this game does follow the movie plot. Some of the sword fights are quite long, and become progressively more difficult towards the end of the game. Overall, we thought it's a pretty good game for the Wii."
4,fun for dad and son,"my 6 yr old son played this game at a friend's house and wanted it for himself. We bought it used on amazon.com for $10 incl s/h. He loves the sword fighting, and his dad enjoyed it too! Together they beat all the levels in one day...so I think my husband might be done with it, but my son is still loving the fighting scenes!"
4,Awesome Yet Kind of Confusing,"This game is full of action and I like that very much. However, I think it has maybe a little too much action. You have to fight something or someone every single 5 seconds. Aside from that, the graphics are great and I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested.Have fun gamers!"
4,Hoping For More.....,"I Have both the Ultimate Ric Flair Collection as well as the Four Horsemen DVD and both are great DVD's but i hope this one has all the matches that i have waited for to be on DVD. Some matches are Ric Flair V.S. Sting (Great American Bash) Ric Flair V.S. Sting (Clash of the Champions I) Rivalry with Macho Man from WWF, Ric Flair V.S. Vader (Starrcade), Ric Flair V.S. Lex Luger (Wrestle War 1990), Ric Flair V.S. Ricky Steamboat (Spring Stampede 1994), Flair returns to WCW to put the belt on Barry Windham, plus there match, And a lot more NWA footage here."
1,Why isn't WM 8 on here???,"There is NO reason why this dvd does NOT include the match with Savage from WM8. I have absolutely no idea why WWE chose to leave that match off of here. I was REALLY looking forward to this release, but now that I know this particular match is NOT going to be on here I think I'll save my money."
2,Could have been much better.....match selection wise,"Of the millions of classic matches that Flair had, why were we treated to the ones we saw, like the forever showed Clash 1 with him and Sting.....that was on volume 1. Where was the Starrcade 84 vs. Dusty Rhosed, Starrcade 86 vs. Nikita, July 11 1987 match against Jimmy Garvin? I only watched the Terry Funk match so far. I do have another complaint, but not about the DVD, but about Flair himself in the documentary. He was talking way too low, and at times, I had to turn the volume up to hear what he was saying. He was almost mumbling. Vince, this is another DVD that you didn't put together right."
1,Cheap bootleg,"This isn't a review on the movie itself, but on this version being sold on Amazon.I'm extremely disappointed in the product. The DVD is not a DVD at all but a DVD-R with a paper sticker on it as the label. The insert in the case is just printed on plain paper.Bad quality, and most likely a bootleg that somehow got past Amazon."
3,good movie but,good movie but there seems to be a scene missing from the beginning and when you go to the menu its like someone black market dvd copied it.
2,Keep waiting for the official DVD release (coming in 2013),"This transfer does appear to be a boot, probably sourced from the old HBO Video VHS release from back in the 1980's. It's watchable if you have a high tolerance for a full-frame, multi-generational image. True fans of this Claudia Jennings classic will want to wait for the official DVD release from Shout! Factory, which is due sometime in 2013 (date TBA). The film is an excellent portrayal of an ""outlaw"" Roller Derby league, with Claudia Jennings playing a tough-as-nails female skater who never quite follows ""the game plan.""This version does not have the original rock and roll songs, which were replaced by a Kendall Schmidt synthesizer score."
4,"Good stuff, but Techron is even better!","This stuff is good, it flies off the shelves at Auto Zone etc, but in my opinion Chevron Techron is even better."
5,Awesome Lucas,I got this product when my 2009 Corolla started to loose power while shifting gears. First I thought it was the throttle body but after using the Lucas fuel injectors cleaner my car was completely fix. For sure I will have to clean the throttle body later but for now my car performance had increased. Awesome product!
1,"""IN TANK"" CLEANERS DO NOT WORK!!!!!!!","I'm still amazed that so many people fall for these ""in tank"" cleaners. They DO NOT work! You might as well take your $5-$12 and throw it out the car window as you drive past your parts store. Master mechanics (I am a car guy) will tell you straight...""in tank cleaners don't really work."" If they do...it will only be ""very temporary at best.""The instructions always tell you to fill the tank up and add the cleaner; however, the fact is the cleaning agent is so weak that it wouldn't ""clean"" anything with more than two gallons of gas in the tank! The reason they tell you to overfill your tank is because of the increased heat that the engine builds up when using this crap.I have (in the past) used many different brands of these cleaners in several different cars. ONE car increased in gas mileage for a grand total of three weeks! Stop wasting your money folks. Use a spray can injector cleaner as they really do work. But no ""in tank"" cleaner works--period!"
2,"It cleaned out my Wallet too, wish I had read this first!",Picked up 2 bottles of this for my wife's Explorer which had a Rough Idle & she just filled up with Ethanol Regular.. . Didn't do a dang thing... Auto Zone claims I got a dollar off at 5.99 but if I look at the price above I got shellacked. Like the other reviewer says you can get 2 qts of TECHRON at Costco for 5.99 for fuel Injector cleaner. Thought I heard a Valve not seating right in my wife's engine. This didn't do anything to quiet that either.
4,Deviates from the traditional DDR...,"DDR Extreme is a solid game. It is DDR in that you move your feet in step with the arrows. However, the songs are different and the Eyetoy is introduced. In some games, the dance pad isn't even necessary. The mini games add a whole other aspect to DDR Extreme. If you're a hardcore gamer looking for the traditional DDR, I would advise against your purchase of this game. However, if you have an Eyetoy and don't plan on playing DDR Extreme excessively, this game is a nice buy."
2,"Great game, flawed to the core","I LOVE Dance Dance Revolution games... I own all of the US mixes plus a few Japanese ones. When a new one comes out I normally stay up and unlock it all. DDREx was an exception. I took it home and plugged in my pad, turned on my PS2 and found that they made a new game engine (DDREx originally came to Japan)... no big deal, must be to better suit the I-cam, I think. So I go to options to find that that is changed as well... and they also took out an option that turns off all buttons except the arrow keys for pad play. A feature that is on all mixes except this one and is necessary when you are playing a song with 16th notes at 260 bpm. Needless to say this made the game just a pretty shinny disc to me. Good for beginners, but I would suggest going to DDRMax 2, better songs, better engine."
3,BEST SONGS BUT WORST WORKOUT MODE,"I have several of the DDR games and DDR extreme has the best music selection by far, which can be both motivating and fun. My only problem with it is that workout mode is terrible. Whereas with other DDR games, your amount of calories burned per step was visible on the bottom right of the screen, this game shows you how many calories you burned only at the end of the song, and if you don't really dance to the song, and just let it play out, it adds the possible calories you could have burned if you did do the song to your total, which can be misleading if you don't realize that. (In other words, it isn't really counting the calories you burn - but giving you an idea of how many calories you CAN burn per song). I would still recommend it - but be aware of that misleading workout mode."
4,Long awaited Extreme hits US,"Yup, its about time we americains get another mix for PS2. Although this one focuses more on the extra features and the I toy rather than the origional aspect of the game. i am also wondering why it is called DDR Extreme, when very few songs from the arcade extreme made it to the US PS2 release. Long time DDR players may be disappointed with the songs on the mix (I was). But I wont say the wait wasn't worth it either."
3,It's going to be alright,"This is going to be a good game, but not as good as the japanese version in the arcades. In the American Versions of ddr they take out a lot of really good songs. The song list in the japanese version has well over 100 songs. This one only has maybe 70 or 80. I would suggest importing the jap. version instead. This game does have some new features though. Such as using the Eye Toy to picture yourself on the screen to see what you look like while dancing. They are trying something different for the songs, I don't think they are going to use a wheel, but i don't know what they are going to use. The ddr series is fun, but i would rather get the japanese version instead of this one."
5,im an expert on this!,This game is realy fun!!! i beated Max 300 and i can do heavy mode and oni mode. im am not a beginner im a dancing machine. i play ths game for hours. in the arcade i beated everyone!! no one can beat me! and that 10 year old guy the can play standard. COME ON!!! im only 11 and i can beat oni mode well some day he might be as good as me if he keeps practacing. oh and my favorite ones are paranoia survivol 290 and max 300. i love the hard ones. they are so fun. and sorry if i was going too hard how good i am.
5,Marshall T Savage The Millennial Project Living Universe Foundation,"This is a remarkable book. It was published ca 1992, and it attracted a following of readers from around the world. The readership continues discussion and project activity at LUF Team on Yahoo. I recommend this book to anyone who shares a concern for the future of the Human Race. We live in a big Universe, with lots of room for Human exploration and settlement. It is vital to have such a well written and illustrated vision set to bring us Humans together to work toward realization of our potential. (th)"
4,Great book.,The book is layed out in a fashion that makes it easy to understand for all ages. The ideas are sound and have been showing up on television programs as of late. I think the ideas are worth looking into and could prove to be a life saver for us all. I highly recommend this book to forward thinkers and those tired of the same ol' same ol'. You will not be disappointed.
3,Good ideas Bad ideology,"The author has some truly ingenious ideas about colonizing the oceans and building stations in space on the moon and mars. I hope to see some of these ideas carried out in the future. After this, however, the colonization of the universe is a little foggy. There are also some major holes in the philosophical aspect of the proposed plan. A good reading if you are interested in the technical and theoretical side (as I am) but a bit thin when it comes to describing how people will act."
4,"A great vision for the future, with some holes","Savage's sweeping vision of the future of mankind in space is truly inspirational. There are some holes in his science and some optomistic misconceptions about human nature, however. In particular, i think he discounts some the sweeping changes in science and technology we will experience in the next 50 years and he overestimates our ability to assimilate these changes and turn them to productive use. In any case, his ideas about the growth and revitalization of humanity through space travel are fascinating and point the way to a bright future. I think (and hope) this book will be seen as prophetic 20 years."
3,Gives one pause to wonder...,"Now, don't get me too far wrong, I thought that this book was very inspirational. So much so, in fact, that I started following the progress of the Foundation that was started as a result of this book. Two things became apparent to me. These were a) many of the ideas presented in the book have severe technical problems, and b) people are not going to go for this in a major way, and the ideas will ultimately probably be superceded by the fast-approaching reality.But do read this book if you have a chance. The writing is deliberately designed to be inclusive and inspiring - it was enough to drag me out of the doldrums one summer and make me interested in this space stuff again. But once you're done reading, don't turn to the Foundation that the author mentions. Instead, turn you attentions to the efforts of a much more ""down-to-earth"" (pardon the atrocious pun) space society, such as the NSS or Mars Society.Peace."
2,"a naive world view. sloppy science, but still interesting","His followers should not take his science seriously. He is a victim of the trap of simple extrapoloations. Little concept of human motivation. A wanna be visionary. But, the book is still interesting and it does send a positive and optimistic message."
1,Misleading product information,"This sounded fabulous from various reviews, but what was not explained was that various supplemental material was created with a specifically creationist bent. I imagine this to be true of the entire series. When the product arrived, bearing a sticker indicating its creationist-friendly status, I sent it back."
1,Not worth the money!,I was unimpressed and learned nothing. It might be worth mentioning that this is self-published by the authors. I wish I had known that--my opinion is that an established publisher would have a hard time marketing it. Just very muddled and not helpful at all.
4,The best,"If you wanna own just two BAD RELIGION records, stick with RECIPE FOR HATE and SUFFER. That will do it."
3,STRONG STRUCTURE,"Oh my, this badn is strong, really delivers the punch !!! Very good indeed. The lyrics are astonishingly great, Greg's voice is unique. A great surprise for me. But I prefer ""RECIPE FOR HATE"" ."
5,Great album,"This is a terrific album, there's a lot of energy and Bad Religion never sounded so aggressive and melodic at the same time. One of the essential BR albums."
5,bad religion is my religion,"this is definently one of my favorite albums of all time. anyone who thinks punk rock cannot be intellectual, should check out bad religion, especially this album. suffer is good from start to finish, even the songs that don't stand out as much at first, grow on you and become some of your favorites. get this album or no control, they are both great. the rest of their albums are actually pretty mixed in my opinion. a few great songs and some not so great ones. against the grain is pretty good and fans of old school punk will like how could hell be any worse. the rest of their stuff, like i said is mixed, but none of it is bad. but suffer and no control, just about an hour of music, are enough in my opinion to name them great. suffer is though, probably their best. if you want thought-provoking,fast,melodic punk, or if you like pennywise you will love this album."
5,You can't beat BR. This proves it.,"Let me star off by saying that I saw these guys live and they are awsome. If you get the chance, see them and I garentee you'll love it.Now, on with Suffer. When I bought this album, I didn't really expect much, mostly because it was an older album by them. Was I ever wrong. This is truely the best music ever written. Brett is awsome on guitar, Greg has awsome lyrics and the drum is as fast as a...bullet train. It starts off ""You (Are The Government)"" which is an excellent song and rushes into 13 more songs of intense speed, bone-chilling vocals and radical music. If you are a fan of all the ""pop-punk""...I suggest you skip this. But if you want real punk music that has true meaning and heart, then pick up this psycho. You will never get a bad moment out of this!!!"
5,Second Best BR album,"With the exception of NO Control, you won't find a better BR album. This one's fast, smart and cool all the way through, a must buy for anybody who likes upbeat music of any kind."
5,A Dust Mite's Favorite Read,"This book was extremely helpful in answering my questions about a recurrence of asthma after being free of symptoms for many, many years. I learned that you never really outgrow asthma and a recurrence is not unusual. I thought the book focused too much on allergies and did not explain how humidity might effect asthma. My symptoms get worse on chilly nights after a day of rain so weather seems to be my asthma trigger. Also the book does not contain any information on asthma support groups and neglects to cover controversial theories about asthma. However, it does describe all the medications you might be prescribed and their possible side effects."
4,Good beginners guide to asthma,"I was diagnosed several years ago. Ignored it, and it got worse and this last summer, it got very serious indeed. I wish I had read this book when I was first diagnosed, I would have saved myself alot of grief."
4,"Much interesting inside info, but limited scenery","An EXCELLENT synopsis of all 145 episodes, laden with background and backstage gritz'n'grease which kept me awake until 2:30 a.m. checking it all out. The only thing keeping it from 5 starz was, although there are photo-shots galore of the cast, there was little else by way of visual viagra. For instance, no display of Main Street Hazzard County, or the Boar's Nest, Flash, Daisy's jeep Dixie, or even a full-length of the General. We have the partial on the cover in front of (a partial of) the Hazzard Garage, but that's it. Still, this old boy's worth its shillings for its literary content, after all, it IS an ""unofficial"" companion. Hot pursuit!"
5,THEM DUKES THEM DUKES!,"This book misses nothing! Instructions for building a General Lee, cast biographies, episode list and guide, merchandise list, even website listings! Folks, if you like the Dukes Of Hazzard or just want to learn more about the show, this is definetly the book for you! It will introduce you to a show that when it aired, became a part of everyone's family night! Unofficial companion couldn't have been a better title. Dukes fans will keep this book at their side 24-7!"
5,They're always after me lucky charms!,"The Dropkick Murphy's rock with this hard hitting at times mellodic album of solid tunes. From Barroom Heroes to Finnegans Wake these Boston punks can take you from testosterone pumping highs to chillin with a nice warm pint of ale. The bagpipes and pub feel is an added plus to fans of Irish decent. The songs and the sounds are all so real that you'll be waiting like me, for the next album."
5,murphys are the best in boston,"when i got this cd, i got it for the name, but once i heard it i became an instant fan. this is more than just punk skinhead music. BUY THE CD CAUSE IT KICKS SERIOUS butt> you won't regret it. this is the greatest punk ever, because it mixes irish tune with classic hardcore sound. awesome"
3,not irish enough anymore,"The Dropkick Murphys are a pretty good punk band with Irish roots, but they've trailed away from them too much for my liking. For some great Irish punk, go buy Flogging Molly's CDs!(Swagger and Drunken Lullabies)"
3,Heard some of the songs and they seem alright,"I heard a couple songs and thought they were decent. I don't know exactly how to describe it...also, SLF covered The Specials ""Doesn't Make It Alright"", not the other way around."
4,Unique for DKM,"I'm sure you know that this is the only album with Mike McColgan as the lead singer. It sounds nothing like other DKM albums, but it's still good."
5,Awesone album,"Dropkick Murphys are far and away my favorite band at the moment, and Do or Die is great. I particularly like Boys on the Docks (Murphys' Pub Version), it makes me want to go hang out in a rowdy bar and make friends with everyone there. Buy this album!"
5,The Working Man's Band,"This should be an ""essential recording."" The Dropkick Murphys are one of the most ambitious and talented musical groups still releasing albums. The fact that most radio stations (Or at least the ones in my area) don't play them is a testament to the shear ignorance of the mass of listeners (I nver listen to the radio.) Whatever is popular plays, even if the bands have little talent or integrity.The Dropkick murphys, with their seamless infusion of aggressive rock and tradtional irish music, are one of the premier rock bacnd out there today. Their music and their lyrics are both entertaing and insightful. The unbelievable talent they exude is absolutely unparalleled. They take rock from the music videos and arena to the level of the working man, where the real music fans are.Highly recommend! Top Ten band."
3,Allright,"Being a die hard Dropkick Murphys fan I was excited to buy this cd. However, I was shocked finding out that the singer is different. Al Barr (found in all the other albums) was not in dkm until after this album. Instead Mike McColgan took lead which changed dkm's whole sound. Their 90s street punk and oi! sound is cool but just not the same as their newer sound. For starters I recommend The Warrior's Code and Sing Loud, Sing Proud! Black Out is cool too."
4,I liked Rancid the first time around,"This album is good, but with the guidince of Lars from Rancid; it becomes difficult to tell them apart. In general though, I thought this was a great punk album. The guitar riffs and the pup like sound is a good mixture. The vocal sound of these Irish men is different but good."
1,A Terrible Cd,"I purchased this cd based upon the reviews in Amazon.com and was deeply disappointed. I am a fan of both punk and music which involves the fusion of Irish music with hard edged rock(ie Black 47, The Pogues). Based upon the reviews, this CD seemed like a good gamble. Unfortunately, there is very little trace of Irish music on this CD. The only exception is the first track, which is quite good. However, the rest of the disc is dismal. It is a blessing that the lyrics cannot be understood because upon reading them they turn out to be not much more compelling than a series of inarticulate grunts. If you are looking for a creative fusion of Irish music and punk, do not buy this album. If you are looking for a numbing exercise in aural monotony, then this might just be what you are looking for."
1,AAAWWWFULLL!!!!,"I am so angry that I bought this book. How can something be ""unauthorized"" in someone's own words?Did he not give himself permission to write this drivel?This thing should go immediately to toilet paper, not paperback."
1,haha,This is by far the worst book of Bill O'Reilly's that I've read so far. Is he even trying any longer or just blatantly trolling America?
1,Waste of time,One star is actually way too much! Do not even consider reading it. Bill O'Reilly is a brain washer. Sells unhealthy agendas and propaganda.
4,Great way to get a foundation in Perl.,Having some previous programming knowledge is always helpful (having a background in C++ helped me significantly) but not essential for this book. I'm taking a Perl programming class next semester and this book was a requirement I started reading early and have gained a significant foot hold in Perl. If you're programming in Perl for the first time or programming in general I would start with this book.
3,Too much spread out too thin,"This book doesn't feel like a Perl book. It feels like Johnson is a C programmer at heart, trying to write a book about Perl.Worse, it's such a wide survey of Perl as to be incongruous. He's got pages devoted to the thought process behind how to structure a program, which is fine for an introductory text; but then he gets into anonymous hashes and different sorting algorithms. Is this an introductory book or not?The chart on page 184 of all the regex elements is completely useless. It shows all the elements, but doesn't explain at all what they do.It sure LOOKS great. I love the visual internal style of all the Manning books.I haven't seen anything that's incorrect, and he writes clearly enough. It's just poorly organized and feels like it was thrown together."
5,Great book to start learning Perl and Programming,"This book is a great way to teach yourself Perl and Programming in general. Coming from a background as a dabbler in C and JavaScript, this book was an excellent starting point for my Perl education. I found the 3rd chapter about programming style and procedure to be extremely helpful. I would recommend this book over ""Learning Perl"" (the llama book) because of its clearly written style and real-worldish examples."
5,Excellent!,"My nine month old child is facinated! focused, tries to repeat words, & watches for hours on his own. This is the best $5 I ever spent!"
3,Likes Blues Clues but not this one so much.,"My 2 year is becoming a huge fan of Blues CLues but for some reason just doesn't seem to get into this DVD as much as the other ones. I don't think it is a bad choice, he loves learning about the letters but for some reason this just doesn't keep his interest. He is only 2 so that may have something to do with it. ;-)"
5,My 2 year old son L-O-V-E-S this DVD! So interactive and fun!,"This is one of the best Blues Clues even though it is older. My 2 year old who has already learned to recognize, and say his alphabet loves watching tis series. It has so many ways of exposure to the alphabet that he has to watch it start to finish. Not to mention the price was amazing too. I would recommend this and the Shapes and Colors Blues clues for any 1-3 year old! I have always loved Blues Clues and now I love it even more."
4,my 2 and 3 yrs old kids watched it over and over,"Helloim french , my husband is american when we were in states (for holidays)i was attracted by the title and the trailer on her other dvd..we tried it and big success. they watch over and over and my daughter started (3) to write letters or sign them with her body... amazed thank blues clues.so i bought 2 more dvd."
3,"Good workout, but not for the klutzy...","I loved Kathy's original videos because they were so simple to follow. This dvd however, is a bit harder. I'm not what you would call a coordinated person, and spent half the workout just trying to figure out what my feet should be doing. I think it's a great workout if you are more inclined towards dancing types of workouts. But for klutzy girls like me, not so much..."
1,I thought it blew,"i have read Aurthor legend books and this one is like soooooooo lame. I threw the book in the trash. I could have been eating sktittles,but noooooo, I wasted my time on that piece of toilet paper. I wish i was able to put no stars on that book but oh well 1 is still low enough."
2,"Horrible staging, music ok","Although orchestra and singers sounds fine (nothing close to Solti's cast and VPO impressive powers) this is a horrible version of the last on the Ring's cycle. Siegfried and Brunhilde look old and everything less heroic, and machine guns instead of swords its hard to swallow. This production should have remained as a cheap CD production."
3,Nice anklet for a teenager,I bought this anklet as a birthday present for a friend. It came in very good condition and looks great. It is very delicate. I just hope that the young lady (15) will also like it. Her birthday theme will be butterflies.I think it looks beautiful and very feminine.
2,school text,"bought it because it was on my list of required reading. Was really glad to see it available for Kindle. Realized only later that it was a reference book. While I find it very interesting and roughly accurate. I can't say I agree with the definitions (which aren't always ""definitions""). There is a fair amount of subjectivity to these terms and their use, but the author provide a pretty politicalized stance wherever possible."
4,Small but convenient backpack,"My son carries his rescue pack everywhere we go. However, it is a bit small for some of his toy trains but for now it will do."
3,"Not bad, but...","It's not a real rescue pack! We got this for our 3 year old because he wanted to be Diego for Halloween and the first thing he said when we pulled it out of the box was, ""Hey, that's not Diego's bag!"" And ya know what - he's right! Diego wears a satchel/shoulder bag - not a back pack. Why go to the trouble of making this if it's not done right? I guess because kids should use a backpack for daily use and not a shoulder bag to help distribute the weight properly for their growing bodies. So, if you want to buy this as a prop or part of a costume, don't do it."
2,"Not Awesome, but decent","This backpack is made of felt-like material. It's far from a perfect match to the real Rescue Pack, but young children should easily recognize it and work it into playtime. All-in-all a good choice if it's for a cheap price. It open on the top with a small piece of velcro, and has an awkward zipper on the side. I'm not sure what the reason for the zipper was, as it just makes it easier for anything to spill out if left open."
1,waste of money,"My son is 3 and begged for this toy every time we we're in the toy store. When we finally bought it for him I was truly upset with what we got. First, the Rescue ""Back Pack"", isn't even a back pack! Your child will not be able to wear it like Diego. It has a small plastic carry handle on top. It also comes with a stethascope that doesn't even work. The kit comes with a 3 or 4 inch plastic jaguar and a small dog food bowl to feed him with, that's about the size of a silver dollar.To round out the kit , you get a plastic xray and an animal info card. He had more fun with the 50 cent matchbox car that I bought at the gas station. Save your money for something worth it. PS. I had to make a back pack strap for him out of some rope so he could wear it around the house, how sad..."
4,zipper problem,"The bag is nice enough and seems durable so far, except for the zipper on the side. There's no metal stop at the bottom and the zipper piece keeps coming off."
5,My son loves this,Great quality and fantastic detail- my 2 year old loves it. It fits great on a child's back and is sturdy.
5,Diego's Rescue Pack,"I bought this backpack to complete my son's Diego costume for Halloween. It is really cute and seems pretty durable. As I read in someone else's review, it does have two straps instead of one like Diego's. But that is probably for the best, at least in my case, to hold it on my son's back. It is not really meant to hold a lot of stuff as it only closes with a small velcro square. Overall pleased."
4,Diego backpack,"Very appropriate for a preschooler, but not durable enough for a school backpack. Has a magnetic closure at the top and a zipper along one side.A big hit for little Diego fans."
1,Schizophrenic's Movie,This movie total garbageHero is just a schizophrenic serial killer'nuff saidTotal waste of timeImagine Beautiful mind meets ____________(fill in you cheeziest martial movie and and then go -20)
1,Not recommended.,"This movie went from cheesy but promising, to abruptly bad, to lingeringly bizarre. Don't waste your time."
1,Ghastly,"Could not give it 0 starsMuddled plot, poor cinemetographyMeaningless story..What a waste of money and time..You were warned!!"
3,WRONG TITTLE FOR MOVIE,"The movie's real tittle is the ""Royal Kill"" which is a better tittle. The movie really has nothing to do with Ninjas. It is more about a skitsofrantic serial killer with a few cool martial arts moves. The characters are supposed to be from a country near Tibet but they speak Pashto which is a language in Afghanistan and Pakistan not really in Tibet. The tittle of DVD really misleads you. Don't waste your money unless you like serial killer movies with a big twist."
2,Poor,"Great concept, started off well but after halfway became boring confusing and pointless. Little action, mostly in the dark when it briefly happened and a useless ending.One to be binned halfway."
2,I wanted to like it,"Overall I was just bored for the most part. I saw similair story lines before so that wasn't anything special.Action wise I'd rather watch a Van Damme, Schwarzenegger, Stallone movie any day.If you ask me Gail Kim wasn't in it enough. After reading reveiws here & given that she's on the box cover I was expecting more screen time from her but I felt like she was one of those monsters you often don't get to see until the end of a monster movie.If you're a Gail Kim fan just get TNA Knocked out or something. That's what I should've done.Really glad I got this cheap."
2,Short story that somehow took 90min. to tell.,"I'm a big fan of Gail Kim and waited very patiently for this film to come out. I knew going in that it was going to be a cheap B-Movie, but that didn't bother me. The movie plot is somewhat intriguing, but is very messy. The film goes for about a half hour after you see what should have been the climax. It's worth a watch for any Gail Kim fan, but anyone else probably won't like it."
1,Pat Morita should be rolling in his grave,"I am flabergasted. I am not sure what I saw. I think I can figure out ""endings"" to most movies but this one...duhh!!! I watched the ending a couple of times just to make sure, but good God in heaven...I just do not know. How in the hell did Eric Roberts and Pat Morita (actors I enjoy watching) get invovled in this piece of crap is the real plot!!! God damn it, I want my hour and a half watching this movie??? back!!!!"
1,"A Terrible Film that is Bizarre, Confusing, and a Waste of Time","This film is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. Ninja Creed has a lack of story, a poor script, and little redeeming qualities. After watching the film, I watched a few of the special features to see if some questions were answered by the cast or director. It appears the actors felt the audience should understand all of the bizarre events that took place throughout the film. Seldom would I give a film one star, but this film barely earns that one star."
3,Wrong Item,I'm sorry. I thought I was ordering the movie. I've not even opened this to listen to it. Wanted the movie.
4,Nice Light,"I bought this light along with 2 others to go in my remodeled bathroom and closet, this one by far was the best of the 3 lights I purchased. I saved a good bit of money by ordering these from Amazon, and am generally happy with this one."
5,Great little book!,I met this author before I knew about this book. He is a very interesting man and he has written a very interesting book.
3,Little disapointed,"I like the show, but I didn't want to pay $5 dollars for just two 22 minute episodes and crappy bonus features. If you like the show buy a season or the complete series because volume 1 only has two episodes"
4,Love this show,I really love this show.As soon as this came out i got it.The thing is that it only has a couple of episodes in it.I was very disapointed.So I got the seasons dvd.they are way better!
3,"A great adventure story, but too short.","Our family loves the Flight 29 Down series! We had seen it in small installments on Saturday morning TV, and were excited to purchase the DVDs and watch it all together. However, I think the entire Flight 29 Down story COULD have and SHOULD have been put together in one single DVD package. Each individual DVD volume is just too short. Buying only Volume 1 will leave you hanging...and disappointed."
4,Pretty Good!,"This is a great tv show for anyone! My brother and I would watch it together with my mom. SHe's 42, I'm not telling mine, and my brother's 7! Its great and always surprising. I can't wait for the upcoming movie and last season. Its Lost for Kids!"
5,YEEHAW! Time Traveler rocks!,"I wrote a review on this video a while back. That one was expressing my rejoice over this episode coming onto video.Time Traveler is a set of a three part episode called 'Labynrinth'. This episode has Acme agents Ivy and Zack chase Carmen through time to prevent her from becoming the greatest thief of all time by stealing items from now, the year 2101, and the year 218.Carmen travels through time by means of a time machine and steals an electro magnet in the future and in 218 A.D. she tries to steal the Roman colliseum to become the greatest thief of all time.That's all the info I,m going to give because I'd much rather you get this video and watch the episode. This show is the best cartoon ever made. Sometimes even seizes the crown from X-men.This one is worth owning in your video collection. I swear it."
2,Audio Doesnt match,the dvd is an obvious pirate as it was in cheap packaging and the audio doesnt sync with the video
3,"Average, heard a lot of the jokes before from other comedians","He has talent but a lot of the jokes he says and lines he uses I've heard other comedians say months and years before he said them. For example, his people who live in glass houses joke that is in previews has been done before almost verbatim. If he can get more original he could be really good."
4,Lots of fun,Funny. Catchy songs. Definitely check this out. I liked so much I downloaded CD. If you like this one check out his earlier stuff.
3,"Great Performance, very bad camera and editing work","The performance are superb. Both Schneider and Oppitz delivered exceptional performance; However, the camera work/editing totally destroys the exceptional performance of both musician. The angle is odd, very mechanical, as if being directed by a 3-year old. The recording could use some polishing. On a decent audio system, one can hear what sound like grunt (and also the occasional breathing) by the performers. My main complain is video work, it is bad, very bad. I had to turn off the TV to enjoy the performance."
1,disgusting,"This book was awful, disgusting, and terrible. I would be ashamed to read it to my grandchildren."
5,Wonderfully Funny,I read this book to my preschool class during a unit on families. After I read it I knew immediately that I had to buy this book for my mother who has 5 grandchildren. I can't wait to give it to her this Christmas from my children. I know she is going to love it! The illustrations are beautiful and the story is just as wonderful.
4,Mesmerizing,I found this book totally mesmerizing. I thought the author did a good job in covering Stanton's later years. She was thorough and honest. I learned a lot and would recommend it to anyone interested in the origins of women's history.
2,Eliz cady stanton,The book was not interestingly written.Stodgy and hindered by too much text regarding political manuvering that did not enhance the subject.
3,"Detailed, but biased","On the plus side, this book fills a gap by studying in-depth the life of an irrepressible foremother. On the down side, the author refutes nearly every other source on this subject, with suppositions about Stanton's and Anthony's relationship, Henry Blackwell's role in the Train scandal, and Stanton's growing solitude. Who knows? Parts may be true. But I found the book overall to be very negative, looking for dirt under the rug and airing out the dustballs. Take this book with a grain of salt, and be warned that is isn't as uplifting as others of its kind."
5,Not a feminist diatribe,"Elizabeth C. Stanton is a writer and historian on par with David McCullough. She somehow manages to document the entire social phenomenon of mid 18th to early 19th century America with an ease that makes this book of history read like a straight forward adventure tale set on an alien planet. If this book was required reading in 8th grade we would have a generation of Americans who would question the entire format of dry politically correct, mind numbing, school board approved history textbooks."
2,a little different than I expected.....,"When I received this product, I was a little surprised to find out how light it was. I was expecting a little more heavy stainless steel finish. This almost seems like tin or something. In a way it's kind of cool because it has sort of a vintage-y feel, if that's what you're looking for. Another down side is that if your garbage is pretty full, it's so hard to pull out! The suction really gets you but also the handle on the plastic insert starts pulling up and digging into the side of the bag making it even harder and sometimes ripping into the garbage bag."
3,If you like a bunch of clowns....,This one is for you. The ultimate in Black exploitation I've seen in a while. This is tasteless comedy. Some of the stuff is so ridiculous you have to laugh. But when you think about it you have to say why did they waste their time with the skits? They should just stuck to stand-up comedy.
1,Lasted about 4 days before it broke,Finally got it installed last week.It lasted about 4 days before it broke - the end came off whatever it was attached to inside the reel part. I haven't been able to pull it apart to fix it.I am unfortunately out of the return period so I'm unable to comment on customer service.Crap product.
1,"No sturdy, breaks easily","I had this line for two years. I just finally started using heavier items like towels and jeans to dry on it, and the item broke off from the garage. Save your money - this is not a sturdy dryer."
3,Line already fraying,"I ordered this to replace a line that I had for almost 10 years. After a few uses this line (which is much thinner than my last one) is already fraying where the clothes prop was placed to support the weight of the clothes on the line. When I replace this one, which may be next spring, I will look for a different brand. It is OK for very occassional use, but I hang clothes out often and this will not hold up."
1,Cheap Chinese-made crap,Save your money. I do not dry towels on this. It still broke after 1 summer.
3,Fine for light load.,"This is fine for a light load of laundry, like socks, intimates and t shirts. Do not use it for sheets, towels or jeans - it will stretch down to the ground."
1,Give this clothes line no further consideration,"While the overall design is basically OK, the mounting bracket is plastic and broke after 10 months of light use rendering the entire product useless. The bracket should be made of metal to better support clothes pin to 40' of line. Don't bother with this item unless you don't mind replacing it within one year or are only planning on hanging underwear and socks on the line."
1,"Not durable, doesn't pull taught enough, pick another product","I have just come back in side after picking up the clothes that were dropped all over my lawn when the plastic housing on this product cracked open causing the whole thing to fall to the ground. And I didn't have nearly the 350 lbs on the thing that it was supposed to hold. I have only had this up for about four months. Perhaps it would be better if you were intending on using it inside, but if you plan to expose it to cold, sun, or any other moderately extreme weather, think about another product.I also have never been happy with the way the cord retracted. I never got it to fully lock and always had to wrap the cord around a post a couple of times to get the tension I needed.Using a clothesline has been great, but I will have to give it another go with a different product."
1,works okay with only light loads and no wind,"I'll add my voice to others telling you to skip this one and buy a different clothesline! I didn't pick this out and was disappointed when I saw the all-plastic mounting bracket, but the purchaser wanted it hung so... today I was picking laundry up out of the grass when the bracket broke. Can't say as I was all that surprised.It's great to use a clothesline rather than the dryer whenever possible, but please, look for one with metal parts unless you want to purchase a new one after just a few months of use."
3,A little less than I expected,"With all the talk of retracting force in the product description, I half expected to ""duck"" when unhooking one end of the line. Turns out, that isn't the case.The instructions that come with the product are a bit vague, too.Once I got the thing up and mounted, I about decided I could have done the same thing with two eye hooks and some clothes line from the local hardware store.But, hey, it arrived ontime, intact, and does work.So, no real complaints."
4,"Good book, stupid names","I almost put this book back down, the names were an instant turn off. Rhage, Zhadist, wrath, Vishous, Tohrment, and last, phury. While I know it's supposed to be Fury, my brain read furry and I picture a vampire into the furry lifestyle dressed as a big mean bunny rabbit or something.However, I am so glad I didn't just a book by the cover, or in this case stupid names, because the storyline itself is great. The characters are more than one dimensional and their interactions make sense, showing both strengths and weaknesses. I especially like that Beth could protect herself as a human and then later on, and was both sexy and strong. The sex was good, the character interplay was interesting, the plot line was satisfying even though one can tell this is written with sequels in mind, it stands on its own with the main plot wrapping up and I didn't feel cheated or that I had to buy the other books, reading it simply made me want to buy the other books."
4,LUV it!,"Love this book! Not the typical love story, it is the type of book you want to pick up and not put down, it's sexy and seductive and romantic and exciting. You will want to read them all."
4,Loved it!,"I really did enjoy this book. I am excited to read book two. I thought this book was exciting, engaging and very enjoyable to read. It was a real page turner for me after I got all the characters and verbiage down I really got into it more. I have recommend this book to certain friends who enjoy these types of stories. I really think it was worth reading. I liked this one a lot more then The Darkest Night (Lords of the Underworld, Book 1) by Gena Showalter. Even though I did like that one too, just I like this one much more. :)If you liked that series you would really like this one. :)"
4,Fun Summer Reading!,"This book is great if you're looking for entertaining paranormal romance. The characters are fantastic, and the story definitely keeps you engaged!"
4,it surprised me,"This book actually surprised me with how good it was. It's sort of a 'romance/vampire' novel. It has its cheesy moments, but overall, a nice addition to the vampire mythos."
1,wow..,bad..just bad...I agree with the other one-star reviews so I'm not going to waste my time with writing the exact same thing
1,Put it in the burn pile,"I don't see what the draw is to this series. I felt the chacters whined through the whole book. The strong males turned out to be the weakest warriors I've come acrossed - and they're supposed to be feared by all. And what was with the evil baby powder smelling guys - Mr. M, Mr. X, Mr. O - Geez! Not worth it."
1,Waste Of Time And $,"I don't understand how anyone could like this book. I am stuck with the box set and can't even give them away. It is filled with characters with rediculous names and it doesn't help that they have terrible personalities. I can't swoon over a group of dudes dressed in leather and long hair. All I could picture by their description where a band of Megadeath roadies. Actually, I think I just insulted the roadies...This book was about lust and nothing more. No real relationships, no chemistry. (Isn't that supposed to be important for a paranormal romance?) I wasn't the least bit impressed and hope that I might have saved at least one person the the unfortunate experience of reading it."
4,Not so dark,This series is nice. Puts more emphases on the order of Vampires. Goes me in depth with their social status and customs. I like the twist she put on how vampires are born and not turned and have to go through some sort of transition that could leave them dead. Then there's always someone hunting them so she creates the Lessers. The book moves at a nice pace and had moments when I wanted to put the book down because i was trying to anticipate what was going happen. Beth ends up entering a world she never thought existed making new friendships and finding love that she never imagined. The books not to sappy; and their terms for endearment are cute. I really like the Glossary J.R. Ward give us to make sense of things. The Characters each have their own personality; no two are the same. She gives us enough to get us through the first book and then leaves us wanting more.
1,Oh Brother - simply awful,"I keep hearing about the BDR Series, I kept seeing the books getting 4 and 5 stars reviews and then when Audible was having a sale I purchased the 1st 2 books. Boy what a disappointment.The story is your basic big bad guy (who is the blind king vampire) meets girl (half human half vampire), girl afraid of big bad guy, girl and big bad guy have sex, sex and more sex, they fall in love and get married and of course someone kidnaps the girl.But the worse part of this book is the writing - it is simply awful and juvenile - they were so many cheeky cheesy lines by eyes were rolling in my head .. ""his throat was raw, and it felt like he'd French kiss a blow torch"", ""let's hang"" to list a couple. To top everything off the narrator Jim Frangione was not much better. Thankfully the 2 audio books did not cost me much because I will have to be desperate to listen to book 2flag"
5,Love it!,I could not get enought of this book. Wrath and Beth love story was hot. I recommend this book. I'm reading the second one now and I'm totally loving it. Rhage and Mary...LOVE IT!!!!
4,excellent!! very hot and romantic too. loved it!!,"I thought this book was great..Just getting over my Twilight high...I needed a new ""fix""..And the BDB filled the void...They are HOT...Love this story..I sincerely hope this series becomes a movie!!!"
5,DARK IS BEST,"I have never written a review for a book or author. This book is one of the best written vampire books that I have ever read. I also emailed the J.R.Ward to let her know how much that I enjoyed her work, she answered me promply and let me know that she was the kind of person that I wanted to keep buying from. The book is fantastic and I will be first in line for the sequels on the brothers."
3,Good but a little too sexually graphic for me.,"I have recently started reading the series of the Black Dagger Brotherhood and was surprised how much I liked the stories. (I am not one who generally reads paranormal and/or vampire books). However, while I am far from being a prude, the very explicit sex is far from being ""erotic"" and tends to distract from the actual stories. I am just about to finish the 3rd in the series and am sorry to say, it may be the last one I am going to read. I will miss not knowing what happens to the next character but skipping page after page of graphic sex only to forget what was happening in the actual story is just too much for me. If you are someone who doesn't mind this type of writing, I think you will really enjoy this series but if you are sensitive (like I apparently seem to be) you might want to rethink this series."
3,"Good imagination, not sure about plot","There was a lot of unneeded information and dead end inquiries. Writing is not great, but imaginative. Some good sex scenes and little action. Overall, I hoped for more."
3,Not bad,"If you can get past the slang, this book isn't bad. I didn't purchase the rest in the series, but I don't regret reading this one."
3,Good Book,"I have started the series and enjoy them very much. My only issue is trying to identify with the Scribe Virgin or the Omega. That is really hard to related to. However, the stories are good and characters are wonderful. I look forward to completing the rest."
4,Well written with interesting characters,"A friend told me about this series and it sounded like something I'd like. She was right. The story is well written and done in a way that makes you want to learn more about the characters. I've actually read the first four books in the series and absolutely love them. If you like this genre, then definitly give this book a try!"
4,Unique Vampire World,"I enjoyed this fresh take on vampires and look forward to reading the next in the series. It is dark, gritty and a little slow in places, but I think this was because so much was packed into this first novel to set up the rest of the series. The love story and Wrath's personal growth make the story a worthy read."
4,This is my first vampire experience,"Reluctance was my first emotion when several people suggested I read the Black Dagger Brotherhood series. I don't like blood, gore, or vampires. I was a little worried this book would be about the occult (it's not). So, I was surprisingly delighted and pleasantly entertained by this book. The story is well done and it sets up the background for the remainder of the series. The characters of Wrath and Beth are well developed. They have an immediate connection that is both sweet and lustful. Wrath is a very honorable vampire and you can tell he will be an excellent leader. This book is difficult to put down once you begin reading it, so allow yourself a week-end to enjoy it. I look forward to reading more by this author."
1,Like Reading a Complete Idiot's Coolest Ever Idea!,Jeez. I don't get the good reviews on this one. I'd like to see those reviewer's ideas of bad books! I am a voracious reader. I've NOT been able to finish maybe 3 books in my entire life. This is one of them. I gave up half way through. There is no finesse to the writing and there is zero dimension to the characters. It is so cheesy that I quit because I was afraid my husband was going to read a line or two over my shoulder and laugh at me. Ward even gives the make and model of the 'bad a**' car and tells what Rap (?) songs (including album and singer) the vampires are listening to. So so very bad!
3,"Stupid Names, Good Story","One of my pet peeves is cute spellings for clever names. I could handle ""Wrath"" as a name. I could probably have handled ""Fury"", ""Rage,"" and ""Torment."" At least that would have been somewhat of a Horseman-of-the Apocalypse rip-off. Then to add insult to injury, the villians all went by initials. The names added a jarring sense of childish humor to what was otherwise a very well written book. My favorite part was that each of the Brotherhood has a nasty curse or handicap. I liked the relationships between the characters, and I even liked the villian. I hope he shows up again. I'll probably read other books in the set, and I'll probably gripe about the names. I'd really like to get Zsadist's story. He's by far the most interesting of the brothers."
1,"Juvenile, contrived soap-opera","To echo the shockingly few accurate reviews of this book found here, from which I constructed the title above - this book is almost ludicrously bad. Over-the-top macho crap that pays lip service to ""girl power"" while essentially delivering a Cinderellaesque sophmoric schoolgirl fantasy with fangs. The characters are one-dimensional, and the frat-boy male bonding stereotypical and caricatured. Written without intelligence, depth, imagination or soul."
1,Very disappointing,"I was very sad after reading 1/2 of this book (i could not even finish it). Based on the almost 5 star rating i was excited to start reading it....but was quickly let down. The book is was what I would like to call ""the hot mess express"". I was all over the place, involving you in one scene and then quickly changing into another that had no relevance to the one before. By the time I was able to figure out what the scene was about the reading once again changed in the same pattern as before. The transition/flow of the book was awful. The scenes in the book were also a let down and not well thought out. I am truly saddened by the fact that i wasted ~7 dollars and hours of my time and i would like a credit please..."
3,Not Bad,"I read the series over the Christmas break which is our summer holidays. Not a bad read, very light reading, just what you need when on a break."
5,WOW! what a beginning,"I picked this book up at the bookstore out of boredom. And thank God for boredom. I wasn't 50 pgs in when I was on Amazon ordering the rest of the series. The vampires are gorgeous and torchered. What more could a girl want. But the truth is that the books are well written, the stories are interesting and not predictable. I like the love scenes but I also love the story lines. They are worth the time it takes to read and I would recommend them to anyone who loves fantasy, or paranormal erotica."
5,Looks Dark...,"When I saw the cover I thought it looked Dark. I really enjoyed this book once I gave it a chance.There is a good storyline going on here.I look forward to more books by J.R. Ward.There is mystery, romance, horror(some), and so much more!There is till so much to learn about the ""Brotherhood"".I really look forward to Z's story one day.I could see this being a long running series. Alot of potential.Excellent writing."
1,"Could barely finish it, let alone read any sequel!","This book was recommended by a friend who has a similar taste in books. At first, I thought I must be reading the wrong book. It is not well written, the characters are shallow, the romance is cheesy and doesn't make any sense. The male lead's personality is all over the place. I found myself skipping sections just to get it over with. In no way was I drawn in to read any of the sequels. Honestly, I've read better fan fiction."
5,Enjoyable,"I have a new favorite author. In the first chapter, the reader is plunked right down int he middle of an important scene, and I personally felt a little confused. But then the second chapter happens, and I was caught up in the story. The characters seem very real, and dynamic. The story does not stop moving, and the romance is amazing. I have definitely recommended this book."
3,OK,I have heard about this series for a LONG time and was looking for a new series so I thought I would give it a try. What can I say? It was alright. I loved the character of Wrath. I enjoyed the book. Just wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I will continue to read the series to see if it gets better.
2,Huh?,"I started reading this book expecting it to be amazing, according to the reviews, it was supposed to be. I started to read it and just couldn't get into it. The way the men talk completely threw me off. It doesn't sound like what people talk like- it sounds like what uncool people wish they could sound like if they were cool. I just couldn't get past it. I don't understand it though- so many good reviews! I have a serious question for other readers. If I could have gotten past the speech would it have been pretty good? Does it get better after the first few chapters? To be honest after the first little portion of the book I just deleted it off my Kindle(which I never delete books off my Kindle, it was that bad!!). Seriously it was terrible for me. Maybe I should have given it another chance(maybe read more), but once again, it sounded so.. just ugh. Oh well, wish I could have liked it the way others did- I love a good series! Unfortunately, this wasn't it for me."
4,What a way to start a series,I can't wait for the next installment from the Black Dagger Brotherhood series. Although at first I thought it started a little slow but almost halfway through if picked up tremendously. Having to wait until next year for Rhage's story is to long and Zadhist. I highly recommend this book.
2,"Beware, I wonder if I read the same book","I was so excited to read this book, thinking I had found a new series to follow. I have to wonder about all the positive reviews here, are they real? For starters, the leading man, is described as large man with tree trunk thighs, yuck, wearing leather pants. I could'nt stop picturing Gene Simmons. Not my idea of a sexy guy. And the names for the guys in the brotherhood. Sooo stupid. Save your money, this book is silly and not romantic in any form."
2,"Same story, different author","I really wanted to like this book. Hot Vampires, a secret underworld, what's not to like about that? But, I found myself annoyed with the heroine, she jumps into bed with the vamp faster than you can say, ""Brad Pitt is the hottest.""So typical. Now onto the Brotherhood, they spend all their time being moody, mysterious and seething with lust and rage, hello? But they have vowed to protect humanity (especially sexy chicks). That is a little too much disinterested benevolence for me. I couldn't finish the book and gave it to a friend who loved it, so it must be a personal preference.I was hoping for an adult version of Twilight or something along the lines of kresley cole. I will keep looking."
2,Ugh! My friends steered me wrong,"My friends have ranted and raved about this book, and the series and maybe that is where I think the problem lies. Always when someone recommends a book or product I get jazzed up thinking that unicorns, rainbows and a leprechaun is going to magically show up and my life will be filled with riches and total happiness. Sometimes that does happen but unfortunately not this time. I thought there would be more fighting action but it turned out more like an adult ""Twilight"" which was another disappointing book. I read two of those books and realized that the kids magazine ""Highlights"" was much more entertaining. Anyway, if you like A LOT of romance, very few fight scenes, and a lot of sex that makes the Harlequin Romance novels blush than this is the book for you."
3,Does a Romance book need chemistry?,"To tell the truth I am only a little more than halfway done with Dark Lover and am having a hard time finishing the book. I enjoy reading ""quick read"" romances and this was on several recommendation lists, but what it lacks is chemistry. The main male character just comes in one day and BAM the female and male are HOT for each other. I am trying not to spoil it for anyone, which is why I'm being so vague. There is definitely a storyline, but I don't ""love"" any of the male characters in the book. Bottom line for me is that there's no chemistry and that's what I look for in a romance book, but you will have to be the judge for yourself. You might love it."
4,Dark Lover:A Novel of the Black Dagger Brotherhood,I enjoyed this book and the entire series. The stories hook you immediately and the characters are larger than life.
5,Dark Lover,"after the 1st chapter i was hooked. I love the story line. After i finished this one, I bought the next four. They were just as good. Can't wait until the next one is published."
4,sexy and fun,"This book was just plain fun. Compare it to a snickers bar for breakfast. It certainly isn't a literary masterpiece in the ranks of Tolkein or CS Lewis,but it was great fun to read. An excellent vacation book, very sexy with super hot vampires, action, and romance. I am looking forward to the reading the next one. It is kind of like Twilight for adults."
3,Unique vampire romance (from The Tealeaf Review),"Finally! A romance novel where the two love interests do not constantly resist one another! They may try to, but Wrath and Beth cannot stay away from each other, and it makes for one delightfully steamy book.I also appreciate in a series of paranormal ""romance"" novels such an original premise. J. R. Ward took the time to put her own spin on the world of vampires, and it's awesome! I love that vampires aren't truly immortal, that they don't drink from and kill humans, and that the ""slayers"" are creepy as all get out!Though it was absolutely full to brimming of steamy scenes and action sequences, I still felt it dragged just a little, but I think this is just a personal problem with romance novels. I'm definitely planning on continuing with the series."
4,Dark Lover,"Most wonderful read. I bought this book on a dare and almost couldn't put it down. My husband, who had a stroke two years ago, asked me to read it to him. It was the first time he has held interest in those two years. YES I will buy all the others just to read to him. THANK YOU"
5,Favorite Vampire Romance Series,"Dark Lover ranks as one of my most favorite books. It is the first book in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series. It combines all my favorite topics, from steamy romance to good vs evil and it even adds some humor into the mix. I can't emphasize enough that if you love paranormal romance you will LOVE this book!!! It brings you into a whole new world and introduces you to a great group of characters that you will fall in love with."
5,review of review,"I just read all the reviews. I am amused and baffled. The spelling of the vampire names was interesting to me and at times I had to look at the names a couple times to figure out how to pronounce them, which I thought was utterly cool. I only wish the females could have had equally cool names instead of Beth, Mary, etc. This book grabbed me in the first 5 pages. I was pleased that it was more adult themed than the Twilight series. I loved that it was real. All of us normal people cuss and get mad and so do these charactors. I felt like I was a part of their world. I laughed, got mad, cried, and thought oh how sweet many times."
3,Quite a story,"This is another approach to the vampire tale that I like a lot. Vampires in this series are a different race instead of just evil. If vampires were to exist, I would think this would be a more realistic look at their lives. This novel dives into the relationship between Beth half-human/half-vampire and here future hellen (partner) Wrath, who is the King of the vampires and the leader of the Black Dagger Brotherhood. The Black Dagger Brotherhood protect the civilian vampires from the Lesser society whose only goal is to kill all of the vampires. After a few twists and turns, the two become one and treat each other with kindness and love, nice story line.Also, this is the introduction to some my favorite characters that are in the series. Rhage, Vishous and John Matthews."
2,UGH!,"Based on all of the positive reviews for this book, I really expected to love it. I was amazed to find out that the hero and heroine only took up about 1/4 of the pages. It's completely annoying. It seemed kinda jumpy and random to me. BTW, how many povs are really necessary? Come on! I have no desire to read about how the villain feels or what he's thinking. I'm extremely disappointed."
4,First of the series and they only get better,"I read about J.R. Ward's series and found my library had Dark Lover so I checked it out. I liked the book so much I immediately ordered the other 4 that were out. This first book in the series sets the stage for the Black Dagger Brotherhood and the books MUST be read in order or you will not understand some of the characters/history. Though this was not my favorite in the series, it was enough to whet my appetite for more. After the 2nd in the series I was hooked. After the 3rd, I was obsessed. After I finished all the published books (5 at this writing) I bought my own copy of Dark Lover and reread the whole series again!!!Congrats to a clever author. Yes, there are some hokey things in the story and I admit the heroines are weak for such strong alpha males, but the world she creates is so compelling you can't help but become immersed."
1,Derivative modern-day Feehan,"I can't believe J.R.Ward has not been slapped with a lawsuit by Christine Feehan's lawyers. Come on... a ""king"" of his people? Marrying a half-human?! Hello. A race struggling to reproduce, for medical reasons!!?? Did no one spot this? A ""brotherhood"" please. I really could not believe how much of the plot came from Feehan's Dark Prince series. There were some entertaining moments. I enjoyed what Ward did with Butch and Marissa. But I cannot recommend a novel that was so derivative of another series I'd recently read."
2,Disappointing!!!,"Man, what a letdown! Even though the story is mildly entertaining, the characters are absolutely disappointing. What the heck is up with the names - Rhage, Wrath, etc. - zero points for originality! And to make a physically imposing vampire nearly blind is absolutely ludicrous. There are far better books in vampire fiction today!"
4,good PNR,"Dark Lover is PNR as it should be. The romance smoulders, but the sex doesn't cross into pornographic or blot out the plot with its frequency. There is enough to keep you titillated, but not enough to make you loose interest if you are the type who likes a little more story.I have to admit hulking, leather clad alpha males aren't my ideal idea of sexy, but they work here. These men are rough around the edges, but have just enough vulnerabilities (not that they would acknowledge them) to make the reader feel for them along with the female lead, Beth. The book does have some of the more annoying PNR qualities, instant unexplained attraction, the leader who has been so respected that he falls in love with the first woman to speak bluntly to him, etc. But these are genre norms, not true complaints about the book.I have the second in series sitting on my bed-side table and can't wait to start it. Ward is a definite go-to for PNR fans everywhere."
1,Oh please....,"I've tried several times to read these books because it is a genre I usually enjoy but the writing is sophomoric, the characters card-board cut outs and if that isn't enough to turn one off, the character names are absolutely laughable! Based on other reviews and even some recommendations from friends, I hoped I was missing something. This is the last time I'll try. J.R. Ward is no Charlaine Harris, no L. J. Smith and certainly no Ann Rice. Don't waste your money or your time! I would have given it negative stars if that had been an option."
2,Ugh.,"Really, really bad. As others have said before me, the book was basically a complete failure in all aspects of writing. The plot was almost nonexistent. The ""romance"" of the book was based upon an extremely unlikely love-at-first-sight experience followed by smut. The characters were cheesy stereotypes, right down to their names (Wrath, Torhment, Zsadist...) The scenes that could have actually been interesting were breezed over. The writing itself was very poor as well. Author gave convenient happy endings for all good guys. It was awful. Don't waste your time."
2,Not so hot,"I wanted to care about my lead characters, l wanted hot sex, three friends suggested I read this and one major web page. Very disappointed in this one. I was more interested in the secondary characters. I gave my friends Larissa Ione to read. Hot sex and great characters. The office is all in a buzz."
5,Fall in Love,"Love, love, love this book! It is a wonderful meet and greet, talk a little and boom! Magic! If you can walk away and not order the next 9 books in this series, you must not have a beating heart, yes it is that good! If you like the Twilight series, this will rock your world, these men and women are all grown up and everything you can desire. I strongly recommend it!"
5,Awesome,I was so craving another great vampire series and I found this. I can't wait to read them all! Yum! J.R. Ward writes a darn good book!
5,Loved it,the story keeps getting better and better as it develops. Can't wait to start book two. Thanks Doris for recommending this to me.
5,Love the brotherhood.,I was drawn to the characters of this book. I finished very fast because I couldn't stop turning the pages. Loved it!
1,Cheese-fest,"Oh boy, where can I start? I usually have good luck using Amazon reviews to choose my next book. This time however, I have to disagree with all of the 4 and 5 star ratings. This book was laughable. I found myself cringing at the dialog between the supposed tough guys. No straight guy in the history of the planet has ever uttered the cheesetastic lines these guys did. And the names......Zsadist, Rhage, Phury, Tohrment....it's embarrassing. I couldn't even finish and I'm still baffled by other people's glowing reviews."
4,I VANT you to suck MY blood!!,"Haha! What a great read! You'll be slappin' those plastic dracula teeth in your hubby's mouth and yellin' ""Come & get it!"""
3,"I agree with ""decent romance, decent sex"" review",Nothing about this book is spectacular but it is very adequate. I don't think I'd recommend it to a friend and I'll likely not read any of the other books.
5,favorite series to date,"This is definitely one of my favorite series. The first time I read it was less than a year ago, and I've read the entire series (through the latest book - Tohr) at least 3 times! Love the plot, love the characters, love it all!"
5,Interesting backstory,Enjoyed this book and the darkness of the vampires. It was a nice contrast with some of the more cheerful romances that I've read lately. I look forward to the next one now that most of the backstory seems to be set in place.
3,Cool take on vamps,"This series came highly recommended and I wasn't disappointed. A little surprised at the amount of heat in it, but not bothered. Definitely not for under 18. The series is a different take on vamps and limits the paranormal to only those which is kind of nice. Not so much all of them at once. Recommended. --HK Savage, author/publisher. Staccato Publishing"
1,Disappointingly unoriginal,"I really found this unoriginal the characters seemed very one-dimensional -the villain ,the wounded hero healed by the ""love of a good woman"", it all seemed so cliched. The whole plot seemed like a rip off of L.Hamilton amd Sherrilynn Kenyon's stuff"
1,"wonderful cover, too bad the story sucked",If I could I would give a negative 5 stars for this book. It was very contrived and stiff. The premise was not well thought out and I thought the villans were wimpy. I also did not like the way the author borrowed plotlines and paraphrased names from successful paranormal author such as Christine Feehan and Sherrilyn Kenyon. This book was a very poor first attempt at a paranormal romance and needs a serious rewrite or better yet burn it.
1,Dark Lover,When I received this book It was missing 20 pages... book started on page 21! I done ordering books from here.
2,Least Favorite of the Bunch,"I started with book 3 and I'm glad I did because I have to say that this book is my least favorite of them all. Wrath and Beth are my least favorite couple as well. I like Beth's character, its Wrath character I can't stand so much. If I had read this book first I probably would have not read any further into the series. This book was really weird for, it came off choppy. I think it sets up the books that follow it very well."
3,I wanted to LOVE this book...but...I didn't!,"I am a huge vampire fan & thought that this series sounded great so I started off with Book 1, Dark Lover. I was very disappointed. I feel it was a well written book but I didn't care for any of the characters, except may be Marissa, but she was a sub-plot. I especially disliked the female lead, Beth. I am a female & must admit that I prefer vampire stories that are told with more of the male point-of-view (POV). Yes, this story had both male & female POV's, but I'd prefer it had no female POV, especially since I didn't care for the main female! I also thought that the authors' choice to name the brothers obvious play-on-words such as Phury/Fury, Wrath/wrath, etc. was insulting to the reader. How obvious. The story was entertaining and original but not a great vampire novel, in my opinion."
5,Best series ever!,The BDB is one of the best series I have ever read. They're thrilling and sexy and funny as hell without missing a beat. I really loved Wrath'a story line!
1,Oh how I wanted to like this...but too much cheese,"Great idea for a story line...but good grief is this one of the cheesiest books I have ""tried"" to read in a long time. Very disappointed. The story idea would have been excellent but the writing is disappointing. Gimmicky, cheesy, trying-too-hard to develope ""cool"" characters...I had to stop reading after 30% of the book. Really bummed because I was hoping this would be a great series to read. Not sure how this book gets such high ratings...must be the story line - definitely not the writing. My apologies to Ward, but ugh!"
4,Excellent,"I haven't disliked one of the books in the whole Black Dagger Brotherhood. The focus on the different characters per book is great, good adult materials, graphic, and an enjoyable read overall."
5,Excellent!,"A great start to a series! I'm looking forward to reading more.This tale of lovers begins in a bar, where a desperate vampire turnsto the race's king for help. This vampires name is Darius and eventhough he dies he still gets his message passed to King Wrath.Darius's daughter is half vampire and doesn't know it.And that's where Wrath and Beth's love begins.They get together but the difficulties that lie ahead arealways going to be there no matter what.A hot and intriguing romance that I truly enjoyed."
5,Black Dagger Brotherhood - Wrath and Beth,I am obsessed with this series - read all 10 books in a couple of weeks.... DIVINE! My favourites were Beth and Wrath and Zsadist and Bella. Cant wait for Quinn and Blay!
1,Wow.....,"I really cannot believe this book got one single positive review. I will freely admit that I am ""picky"" about books. My number one requirement is that a book be written in a way that grabs me, keeps me interested, the words themselves blend into the background of the story.....this book reads like a badly contrived attempt to write. The way the main characters names were spelled was (dare I say?) contrived and juvenile. Character development seemed (sorry, people) contrived. This is not the first book I've deleted from my Kindle, but it is one of the very few that I simply could not force myself to finish. This series was recommended as a ""stop gap"" for readers who were waiting for another volume in their favorite vampires series, and all I can say is ""uh, NO."""
2,overrated,"Very bad writing,cliched romance book,grown men talk like teenage girls(""I outie"")If you're in the mood for a trashy romance book then this is the perfect read but if you are a sci/fi fantasy book reader skip this sophomoric nauseating drivel."
3,Dark Lover: Funny,"The book was entertaining, I'll admit that. I cringed at some of the descriptions and dialogue, and the whole ""white boys talking like they grew up in the 'hood"" was a bit puzzling, but I did get some good laughs out of the book. As long as you don't take the book too seriously, you'll be fine."
2,"Average novel, unrealistic romance.","I'm quite surprised this book has gotten so many 5-star reviews.I thought the story flowed well, the read was fast and easy, so perfect romance novel material in that sense.But god dang the romance part of it was INCREDIBLY unrealistic. I don't know about you, but I'm quite tired of romance novels where every single creature with two legs is a) incredibly flawlessly attractive and b) experiences lust beyond measure at first sight.Vampires aren't real, I get that. But what I don't get is how such an unrealistic progression of feelings can appeal to such a wide audience.I guess I can sort of understand why this book appeals to so many people, but I really wish readers would set higher standards for themselves."
3,Could have been better,"Going into this book I knew it was romance. And I was very excited to read this book and hoped to find a new series I loved. However, after 200 pages in I felt the book was more focused on the sex between Beth and Wrath. I don't mind sex scenes in a book, however, this was just more than I cared to read about. The storyline was/is intriguing, I just wish there was less sex and more story.The characters are very well fleshed out and even though Wrath is supposed to be big, mean, and scary, you can't help but love him right off the bat. Beth too, the author did a great job of making the reader really see the characters. The names of the brothers I thought a bit odd. And I wondered, if I met someone named Wrath wouldn't that seem strange, that's not really a name. I wanted to love this book and I did in the beginning, but as I said before, too much sex, not enough story. Because of this, I put the book in my trade bag, I could not finish it."
5,Can't get enough!,"I'm not usually into paranormal books of any type, and have had little interest in vampires.I picked this book up and was hooked! The Brotherhood are most definitely Alpha Males to the extreme and the women who love them are strong and don't let them walk all over the place beating their chests - until they get into the bedroom and then, grab a fan, open the window, get some ice water to cool down! The sex is steamy and tender in turns and the characters realistic as they try to keep and protect their loved ones and their race from the Lessers.I literally inhaled these books as fast as I could.Now I have to wait a month to get V's story!Fantastic!"
5,Loved It!,"Man! I loved this book. It has all the things I love in a story. Fantasy characters, romance, and action! My favorite thing about this book is that the vampires are the hero-types, not the bad guys. I give two thumbs up and two big toes up to this wonderful story. I can't wait to continue reading the Black Dagger Brotherhood."
5,WHOA! That is what I said when I finished....,Yep WHOA! The scenes in this book are amzing. You fall for the main characters from the beginning. I didn't know if I would like it since the viewpoint did skip from person to person in the book. But it allopwed you to see each viewpoint of the plot. Once you get over the first shock of seeing this it becomes easy and natural. Wrath is the guy that every girl wants. I would kill to be Beth for just a hot second.I do mean HOT. hehe. You became interested in the other men of the brotherhood. Zhadist was one that I wanted to find out more about most.( His book is number 3) This is a great read that will keep you up all night. If you like hot steamy PNR books this has got to be on your list as a must read.
5,This was my first book in the series and I loved it.,"This book made me want to read more about the brotherhood. I heard about the Black Dagger Brotherhood and at first, was not interested. But after reading the synopsis about the book, I decided to try it."
4,A new twist on vampires,I really enjoyed this book from beginning to end. I'm looking forward to continuing the series and seeing how the other members of the brotherhood get matched up with the ladies.
5,This is the book that got me hooked!,"A year ago I was in a quandry, my favorite author, KMM, was slowly releasing her latest series and I was just getting back in to reading after a nearly 15 year hiatus. I took a chance and ordered this book upon the recommendation of some friends. It might be a slow starter, but by the third chapter I was devouring the plotlines, the romance, and the characters. Ward is a master at crafting a paranormal romance, and though this book might not have the speed of the novels that follow it she does a great job of setting up the books that are coming. Wrath and Beth weren't as steamy as most probably think that they should be, but their love story was more down to earth than most of the other romance that I read. If you love vampires then you'll love, love, LOVE JR Ward!"
4,Looking for more vampire romance?,"For lovers of Twilight and Sookie Stackhouse, this is a great series to dig your teeth into! Definitely for those looking for more vampire and adult romance to enjoy. Warning: you'll want to buy the whole series at once, you won't be able to stop at just one!"
5,Loved This Book,"Needing a new book to read, I picked this one up in the grocery store last week. Thought I'd take a chance on another vampire romance. I loved this book. It is well written and I can see how the author is setting up events for the sequels. I get so tired of some of the vampire romance books out there, with the main characters being ridiculously jealous or perfect, or whatever. I found the book to be ""believable"" (as far as vampire romance books go), and this made it an enjoyable read. I am actually re-reading it to catch anything I missed the first time, and am enjoying it more the second time. Looking forward to the next book by this author."
3,Good but lacking..,"This was a nice book to read during the holidays when I didn't have a lot to do. I enjoyed the premise of the story immensely, however, I wish there was more character development... and a little more depth. The characters seemed to lack dimension... But like any woman.. I loved all the drama & passion... so that made up for the parts that lack. I will probably buy the next book."
3,ehhh... it's ok,"a well written book, but so cliched... I thought the main characters were just too unbelievable. maybe I'm just not into the macho lovey dovey type. at one point in the book, I was like ugh yuck! I'm all for the loving sensitive type, but the hero is portrayed here as a dangerous killer, yet he's so freaking mushy that it kinda ruins it for me. oh, and the street slang is so off that I'm like WTH, Ms. Ward, can you pls hire a street thug to give you lessons please!?! i give it 3 stars cause I actually finished the book without tossing it."
5,Love this item,This book is the first full linthth book I read by my self some years ago it is the first book in the Black Dager BrotherhoodI have fallen so deeply in love with this series that I am now buying and replacing all the books i have and all books in hard backI LOLVE LOVE LOVE LOVE.......THIS SEARIES
4,A pleasantly entertaining read.,"I really enjoyed Dark Lover and anxiously awaiting Lover Eternal. My favorite character in this series is Rhage. I don't mind the names, actually thought they were unique. I did however, find the ""love at first site' scenario a bit overused and clich?d, but the love scenes were sensual enough to keep me smiling.I'd also recommend D.N. Simmons Knights of the Darkness Chronicles if you enjoyed this series as much as I did and even if you didn't, that's an awesome series as well."
1,Not impressed,"I recently purchased the box set for this series and wish I had done more reviewing before buying the entire set! I have only made it through the first 8 chapters of ""Dark Lover"" and now it sits by the fireplace...I plan on completing the book, but it's not one that makes you want to read more...I sure hope I didn't flush my money down the toilet, because so far it feels that way."
1,Just didn't grab me,"I am a huge paranormal romance fan. I love Keri Arthur and Laurell Hamilton. This book didn't do it for me. All the weird made up words just didnt make sense. The book opens up with a glossery and then just starts. No background, no information, just 2 guys with strange names hanging out in a bar. Kudos to those who got through it and like it. I really wanted to like it but just don't."
4,Wonderful,"Highly recommend this book to paranormal romance lovers. Fans of Kenyon, Sands and Feeham will also enjoy this author."
4,Full speed out the starting gate!,"J.R. Ward is an excellent writer, so I wonder where she's been until now! Has she been writing under other names? She gives us an action-packed alternative world, filled with warrior vampires, soulless humans, and lovers who bond for all eternity. Wow! Her secondary characters are fully rounded, and I couldn't wait to read their stories. Her mythology and the world she has created are both compelling. I only give it 4 stars, though, because her choice of names annoys me (Rhage, Tohrment, Vishous)...and she leans a bit too heavily on hip-hop culture. Since vampires live a VERY long time, I would think they'd have better taste in music! On the other hand, she is a very careful writer, and her editing is smooth and professional. This was a pleasure to read, and I highly recommend it."
5,Great Start for Series,This is the first installment to what has turned out for me to be the best paranormal romance series I've read. What I like best is that the book is written from the view point of several different characters.
5,FANTASTIC condition and super fast shipping!!!,Book arrived in mint condition even though I expected to be slightly used or read once at the very least!
5,Excellent read,This book is fantansy meets erotica meets suspense. The shows the creativity of the writer and I would recommend it to everyone
2,Old and Tired,"This book was mediocre at best. It is like many books out there that promise a surprise and does not deliver. The real let down in this series is that the main character keeps shifting, and follows the same familiar plot-line over and over. A vampire (or werewolf or other) falling for a human while all the other fellow warriors eventually fall for those they should not fall in love with (further down the series). Each hard-hearted man is somehow overcome with lust, jealousy, and love to finally allow a woman into their lives. It is a tired story line and there is nothing new here. The men are hot but without depth. The women also are only a hot female body. It is boring and this book was a let down. Skip the book so you are not disappointed like I was."
1,I can't finish this book!,"I'm not a romance literature fan. I used to be, but after over 4yrs of not having read a romance novel, I decided to give this a go. It's too cheesy to finish: the dated references, the continuous leather pants wardrobe, the even cheesier names (Rhage, Phury, Thorment, Wrath). Lol. The initial encounter when she flings herself at the man could've passed for a drug induced haze, had she not sobered-up and still been willing. Now, a woman who was almost raped 24hrs ago, is cool getting down with a stranger she thought was going to kill her two seconds ago! A man who is in her locked apartment. She's cool with it. I'm sorry, is lust this strong after attempted rape? Do recent victims give an intruder a free pass to break-and-enter them, since the intruder proved so efficient at breaking-and-entering their homes? At this point, I'm done. It's all I can do to not laugh myself into respiratory distress."
4,"Kinda silly, but very readable","I really enjoy the Sookie Stackhouse books, so thought I would give this series a try. There are a few things that don't work - the silly names, the endless ""cool"" hip hop gansta talk, and the cardboard characters. Practically, everything sets you up for a creamy thighs scene. I do like the human Butch and his interaction with the other characters. I hope that he doesn't get killed off in a future book. Wrath needs to get over himself. These books are not very well written, but I appreciate the authors imagination and will probably read the next one just to see what happens."
5,a great read...,"Friends have tried for months to get me to read some paranormal romance, but to no avail. I finally tried a couple of books, but was still unconvinced until this one. What a great read! I had a hard time putting it down, and can't wait to read the next in the series. Highly recommended!!"
4,Enjoyable Read,So glad someone posted a quote from this series on a FB page. I totally enjoyed the characters and writing....now I've got a Lot of catching up to do reading the rest of the series! Looking forward to learning more about these vamps!
2,"My kids loves this, but I don't","I was kind of hoping for a more ""old spiritual"" kind of gospel sound with these songs. They're just kids singing old church songs that I grew up singing but rarely hear in contemporary services anymore. I was really looking for more of a black gospel sound. I have to skip over many of them because it irritates me to listen to them. I may just pair down the few songs I can tolerate and end up making a ""best of"" mix CD to get my money's worth our of this collection since my 2 year old does like to listen to it in the car."
4,Solid product - does what you would expect.,The slightly more expensive model on Amazon - I needed this product to measure the sound level of train brakes. One of the cool features in my opinion is that it will measure the maximum dB level recorded over a period of time. One possible con would be that the device cuts off on its own after what seems like a short period of time however this might be configurable (haven't done enough research to find out).
4,Great,"Very well-written and helpful at pointing out ideas, suggestions and considerations that are important when getting ready to do the ""merge""!"
1,Horribly BAD SF,"...and not really good fantasy either.For me, the atrocious SF aspects of this book ruined it for me. An invasion from another planet, ok. With slower than light ships, almost ok. USING CAVALRY???And then they want to ship BUILDING MATERIALS back?? Haven't they ever heard of ROCK?This was just a terrible book."
1,A true disapointment.,"If I could give this book zero or negative stars I would. Shanji is a perfect example of a good idea that is horribly mangled resulting in a bad book. While the characters have mildly intesting cultural and psychic charateristics, they are neither explaned or even use to thier capsity. The end ""battle"" is a sad staged anti-climax and the book ends with more problems than it started with! While this may be a try for a sequel, the reader simply does not care enough about the characters to plunk down another $4."
3,"Important book for me, it could be for you too!","I have read more memorable and more exciting history books than ""In Defense of History."" However, I will always regard it with affection. This book in its small way is the reason I decided (over 2 years after reading it) to major in history and become a(n) historian. I had always enjoyed history, but not so much the dry history tomes students are often required to read. Evans book was accessible and witty and downright interesting. If you are interested in historiography or the philosophy of history, something few students are exposed to except at the Ph.D level, this is a great introduction. At the time I read this I did not even know it could be considered a rebuttal to Francis Fukuyama's ""The End of History and the Last Man."" I hadn't even heard of Fukuyama then. Once I realized this, I loved history even more. Some books shape us not by their contents, but by ours. Any book can be a life-changing one, if you let it."
4,How to Write History.....,"Richard Evans attacks a controversial topic on the world of history today -- how to write history. There are many schools of theory in the historical profession which can affect the way historians view historical sources. Evans particulary narrows his viewpoint to those historians known as ""post-modernists."" He does this beccause post-modernists are perhaps some of the most controversial historians, not to mention the very theory itself, in the profession today. He also ponders what place post-modernists do have in the historical profession.Evans explores how some historians have gotten into trouble with how liberally they took their sources -- concentrating on one scholarly work about the Holocaust.This book is sure to continue the debate that continues to this day. It is thought provoking and will lead to more debate, to be sure."
2,Sounds weak but modern day,"I have not read this book but this caught my eye in the notes ""but it includes many visuals, making it nonreader friendly."" I have never seem that term. Why should a book meant for reading be NONREADER FRIENDLY, has modern book publishing followed that low? It also mentions that it's not as readable as Asimov's book. So why don't they reprint his book and add some pictures or maps. Based on such a weak review it would seem better to recommend the concise history of the Byzantine Empire by Treadgold or by Haddon or go back to Asimov."
4,Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum,good item. pictures are old - disappear emblem KMT both on top of tomb and entrance but today added emblem KMT on top of tomb.
2,No.,"Ross presents his Just Right universe as an amazing coincidence, but relationships among his listed parameters are not considered. His probability description of their existence together as infinitesimally small doesn't allow for increased chance of occurrence from cause and effect. For example, a ""just right"" level of tectonic plate activity contributes to and increases the odds of a ""just right"" level of soil mineralization. Physical world aspects are not separate. Probability calculation is tricky. Ross' idea misleads, but his book is thought provoking and provides some useful information."
2,A god or the god?,"I browsed through several chapters of the book, it bascially states by probability argument that the chance we exist today by random variation is really slim without an intelligent designer. However, the author in his first chapters set out to prove that the designer is not just a god, but the god of the Bible, and the god of the Christian faith, and the Bible is as flawless as any physical laws we know now. In the later chapters, he fails to address the accuracy of the Bible by providing concrete experiemtal evidence or refute most of the inacurrate claims in the Bible."
1,Ross again misleads and misrepresents science.,"If one could be sued for slandering science and logic Ross would be a primetarget. It is a toss-up, or throw-up, which fraud is worse, that of Ross or thatof Gish and Morris. Lederman, Einstein, Fermi, Hawking, Dennett, and Darwin must belaughing or crying over this misrepresentation and lame attempt at self-justificationand zealous misuse of paper and print. I suggest that Ross do some realreseach (his degree suggests he knows how). He may learn a little from some secondarysources about the issue by reading Dennett's ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"" or any of Dawkinsbooks on the subject. He should also take a few basic logic courses, he seems to havemissed or failed those subjects in his educational pursuits."
3,"Good book, average apologetic","Ross continues to get hammered for his local flood theory, but fact is, it's not his idea. The local flood idea was around long before Hugh Ross. Furthermore, it is not even the central theme of this book. This book does a good job of proving the existence of a god. Unfortunately is falls short of being an effective apologetic for the Christian God. This is not a result of Ross' writing, but rather his approach. Recent cosomological discoveries are certainly proving the existence of a creator, as Hawking now understands. But even Hume understood a creator in the universe. That didn't make him a Christan. This is a good book for Christians to bolster their faith and study an old earth perspective, but it probably isn't the best apologetic for the unbeliever."
2,Ross Argument is overly aggressive,"Dr. Ross's book was required reading in a Cosmology class I took, and I found it to be interesting but somewhat offensive at times. Dr. Ross spends much of his time attacking his critics, and less time supporting his argument that the only possible creator is the christian god. This was perhaps the greatest failing of this book, as Ross' attempt to prove that the christian god is the only possible creator lies almost exclusively in a chapter on extra-dimensional power, which is almost completely unsupported except through bible passages. I found this book interesting at times, but unconvincing due to the author's overly aggressive writing and lack of support in necessary places."
4,"Thought-provoking, but sometimes weak","This book is educational and provocative, however, I found myself asking, ""Where's the proof?"" for a few of his key arguments. Statements that were made without any real proof weakened his overall arguments."
2,Probably the Worst Ranma DVD in 6 seasons,I am a big Ranma fan but I have to say that these 3 episodes must be the worst I have ever seen.The curse of the scribbled panda is about Ranma having to go on a date with a cartoon panda character that escaped from a scroll in order to return it and 2 monsters back to the scroll. Please... how bad a plot can you get.The legend of the lucky panda is just so completely out of character in a different time and place that it could have been written by a substitute script writer that didn't know anything about Ranma.Mystery of the marauding octopus similarly is set in a different place and seems so completely out of place in the series.This is probably only a DVD for diehard Ranma collectors who want a conmplete set. Others should look at the other DVDs in the series which are mcuch better.
5,wabahobbahowieeee,"This box meets all my expectations. My computer and cell phone found it immediately and the sound quality through my stereo varied with the quality of the transmitting device up to excellent with my computer. In other words sample speed counts, but the DC800 seemed to exceed the quality of my other devices. So the quality is excellent! No more wires! I have not used it's two-way capability, however. It will be cool when I decide to rip an LP into my itunes though."
3,almost right.....,This is good but just not good enough. Somebody has to figure out a better way to open these without the juice spraying everywhere. The consistency is like a raw hot dog. It's not that spicy or pickled. I don't mind it's not so spicy but I prefer more pickled and more like a boiled hot dog. These 3 specific things are why I'm still looking for the best pickled sausage.
2,what is this cd?,"I'm guessing that this cd is Shuffle by Okui Masami, since that is the only single I know that's been imported from Japan. That or it's CAVE's single of YuGiOh ""Rakuen"" meaning ""paradise"". I hope that you guys buy it and see which one it is! But really, [$$$} for something you don't even know what it is? I'd say shoot for your luck, and get it, just because it's YuGiOh!"
3,Megashark,"Iam always been a fan of sharks, I have several books about them, including technical and popular magazines, but I was expecting a little more about this especial DVD. A little expensive for a program TV"
2,magnetic wreath hanger,Sticks to the door great but when you go to take it off it can take the paint off the door as well! There should be a warning label on them!
2,Too Small,"This product is way to short in the Legs. Do not recommend if you are over about 5'5"" tall."
4,Great for Pure Scholarship,"I used this book for the purposes of a senior thesis: Thomson's scholarship is thorough, and this provides a fairly good starting point for anyone attempting serious scholarship on missionary-Chinese collaborations, particularly for that 'quiescent' period between 1928-1937. The book isn't the most thrilling to read but I found it an absolute necessity for my own scholarship."
2,"Great Graphics, Sloppy History","The book has a number of errors in it, some from bad editing, others from sloppy research. I used it to try and piece together what happened when during the battle, and found it very confusing. I'm a fan of the Osprey series, but unless you like the maps in this book, you'd be best to look elsewhere for information on the battle."
4,"Brown Eyed Beginnings , Van Morrison","If your a true Van Morrison fan this CD is for you! The musicians playing with Morrison bring his artistry to a new level,the bass playing of Eric Oxendine on ""Brown Eyed Girl"" plays in my head even hours after listening to the song."
5,Brilliant and Cancelled,"Caught this series for the first time after waiting for it to be rerun, and could not believe a show of this calibre was killed. Adrian Pasdar's performance as lethal executive Jim Profit is magnificent evil and carnal lust in a polished, yuppie, corporate mode. Each of the episodes brings Profit closer to a one man corporate take-over the old fashioned way -- by killing off the competition, and climbing the upwardly mobile ladder corpse by corpse. Black humor abounds in this television series too dark for most. Outstanding performances by the entire supporting cast, but it's Adrian Pasdar's show, esp. at the end of the day as Jim Profit climbs back into a Grayson and Grayson box after a hard day at the office...chilling and adult. Definitely not what the networks wanted. Offensive to the maudlin tastes of mainstream TV viewers, nevertheless, this was one program that was just too nasty good to last, fortunately saved on DVD."
5,"An amazing show, tense, evil, psychotic, over the top...and proud of it","Me and the wife watched Profit on the Fox while they show it on the first and only run on Fox. It's rare for either of us to get really excited about a TV show, the most recent being Rescue Me on FX, and there's been maybe half a dozen in as many years, but Profit was a show to get you excited, to make you sit up in disbelief. Then it was gone, as quickly as Jim Profit graced the screen, he was cancelled. A show ahead of it's time, and I believe it's time is today, when we see corporations ripping apart the economic fabric of the U.S. by sending jobs overseas and screwing the few employees they keep in-country.Regardless, highly recommended, and while you're at it, write FX, TNT or USA and tell them to pick up the rights so that the story can continue."
3,i like this one,I enjoyed this. recommend this purchase. I enjoyed this. recommend this purchase. I enjoyed this. recommend this purchase. I enjoyed this. recommend this purchase.+
5,By FAR one of the greatest series ever made!!!,"Adrian Pasdar is probably the only actor who could have played this role as effectively as he did. This was a series that was years ahead of it's time and it was the short sightedness of network affiliates that robbed us of this truly amazing treasure of a series. I saw this series for the first and last time over ten years ago when it aired and for a series that only lasted a precious few episodes left such an impression on me that I was able to quote parts of it years later. You can imagine my shock and joy to find out that it was out on DVD. No one I have ever shown this series to has not ended up loving it.By far the most unique concept I ever saw. The ""hero"" is a complete psychopath who will destroy anyone who gets in his way. I never saw a charactr like Profit before and I'll never see one quite like him again. If you only see one DVD tv series this year make it this one, trust me you won't regret it!"
1,Dreary story about unsympathiic charaters.,"Bleah! The pilot was enough, great actors terrible story. There were no real likeable charaters, just sad people doing bad things to each other, not for me."
2,Not nearly as good as it might have been,"You would think that this book is primarily about the modern industry of container shipping on the high seas, and there is some content along those lines. Unfortunately, the voyage coincides with 9/11 and the author, a former magazine editor, repeatedly abandons his primary topic in favor of pointless self-absorbed mewling about the twin towers tragedy, whose dated references ruin the book. What we end up with is magazine-quality travel writing, and spoiled travel writing at that. Be advised."
4,Terror at Sea,"If you think the life at sea may be boring and routine, guess again. The Colombo Bay reverses the stereotype and gives the experience on the water an exciting and suspenseful edge. Throughout this book, Richard Pollak paints an authentic picture of the world after the September 11th attack. He displays the inability to transport the worlds most necessary resources from country to country in vivid detail. Also, you will feel as if you are aboard the ship as Pollak virtually places you directly next to Captain Peter Davies. After reading this book, my eyes have opened to an entire new viewpoint on the terror at sea."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I am a former employee of P&O Nedlloyd; the company that owned the ship this book was named for. I've been looking forward to reading this book hoping to relive some of the glory of my tenure with an outstanding ship line. Imagine my surprise when after less than a chapter into it I realised that the author simply used the experience and subject materiel as a platform from which to spew his liberal diatribe. He hijacked what could have otherwise been a very interesting book and fascinating subject matter with his own political agenda. Mr. Pollack, couldn't you have left your politics landside long enough to write the book you told P&O Nedlloyd you wanted to write? They never would have agreed to a political commentary under their name. Shame on you."
5,Outstanding - Even better now (the second time through),"An epic to rival (but not surpass) The Lord of the Rings. Different in many ways, but fantasy epic nonetheless. Anyone interested in the environment would be amazed at the manner in which the author gives ""The Land"" a life force of its own. Each entity of life, nature and existence has a palpable, visible vitality, which is one of the reasons that the author has chosen to use a leper (whose degenerating nerves shouldn't allow him to experience it) to give it even more vitality than the people of the land appreciate. And those people appreciate it amazingly. A good, thorough vacation into fantasy."
3,A Gift,I bought this as a gift for someone so I have no idea if the story is any good but the book arrived in good condition but was several days late for Christmas.
4,Godd epic fantasy tale,"I read both the first and second series when I was a teenager. I enjoyed all six books very much. I loved the fantasy creatures, especially the Giants. I have just decided to re-read the entire series, now that the last set of books is complete.I found the story gripping and entertaining. I particularly like the symbolic way that Thomas and The Land are actually the same thing. As leprosy weakens Thomas's body, and insanity creeps into his mind, so goes the fate of The Land. Good series, worth reading if you like fantasy."
5,Re-read #6,I have read this series six times. A complete world is created in the mind of a man or is it all within another reality? This is a highly thought provoking look into the rules and structure that a leprous person must deal with. Plus a ton of fantasy with creatures you never dreamed of.
5,"Thought it was a boxset, not one huge book.","As the title implied, but that it alright. It's one big book, all three stories are inside. It's big, it's thick and it's 3 stories. I read this as a teenage kid, so I got it for my grandson who is a little younger, but has a good imagination."
3,Not the best nor worst cookbook of its kind,"Ms. Reilly does have a few recipes that work out ok, but some that are the absolute pits. If you are new to cooking, this is not the book for you. Many of the recipes have dough that is very hard to work with and ingredients that can be hard to get. If you are celiac, my advise is to cut back on the sweets and try to work around traditional recipes on the savory. I personally don't care for pie crust that is full of eggs and vinegar. If you do, then this is the book for you."
5,Gluten Free Baking recipes,I purchased the book used and it arrived in perfect condition just like new. Lots of recipes to try for holidays and everyday. Nice book to add to your collection.
5,Gourmet Excellence!,"This cook book is my favorite for gluten-free baking. Truly gourmet recipes from someone who clearly knows what they're talking about. The recipes in this book produce really great food--the type of food that people won't know is gluten-free. The instructional explanation of technical terms in the front of the book is really helpful, too."
5,The book I turn to when I need a gluten-free dessert.,"By far, the most consistently wonderful gluten-free desserts I've tried. I can count on them to be delicious for company, even if I've never made them before. The only thing I'd change: I double each recipe for more servings :)Also, a non-celiac friend begged me to make the pumpkin bread for her because she liked the taste so much better than the gluten versions!"
4,thanks,"This really cam in good for my baking class and it also came on time, It also has lots of yummy stuff inside..."
1,Non-Standard sizing,I normally wear an extra wide shoe. I ordered these in size 4E and it was too narrow to even start getting my foot into it.
5,"Buy the coffee table size hardcover, not the paperback!","It's got such fantastic photography, the hardcover is well worth the investment."
5,Photography,Great photographs in this book - largely by John Cleare one of the world's greatest mountain photographers. Thank you John for yet more stunning photographs!
2,A turn for the worse....,"Don't get me wrong, I love the pietasters, but this album just sucks. There are too many covers on this cd including New Breed, Time Won't Let Me, and Quicksand. Not too mention several preleased songs appear including Crazy Monkey Woman and Without You (its 3rd appearance). However the Pietasters do manage to put out two excellent songs (Out All Night and Fat Sack). If you really want to hear the Pietasters get Strapped: Live or Ooolooloo."
3,Disappointed,"I was trying to expand my ska collection and came across the most excellent Oolooloo. Oolooloo is a first rate album with some great ska tunes on it. Willis on the other hand is not a ska album. There are a few ska like tunes with their great horn arrangements, but otherwise a pretty mixed bag. I don't mind bands expanding, but the vocals are pretty poor on a number of tracks. Like I said in the headline I was disappoint and I think this album is a little over hyped on Amazon by reading the reviews."
3,What happened to the guy's voice?,"Sure this CD is original, but when you follow up oolooloo with something like this, you get a little disappointed. Good thing Without You is a classic, even if it sounds like ""under the sea"". It makes the album good."
1,A little bit of that sell-out ska,"This album is awful, Steve Pietaster's voice is ridiculous compared to his soulful crooning on Oolooloo, the songs are generally lame, a poor attempt to catch onto MM bosstones coattails. The pietasters should go back to Moon Records, where ska is king and the sound is sweet. The ""new"" sound of the pietasters is awful, if you like this album you obviously dont know anything about true 3rd wave ska. Buy Oolooloo or Skaboom (the Toasters) and get a clue."
4,great not-Ska,"I bought this album a year ago when I was big into ska and was disappointed. Now, after a total change of taste (moving towards indie and electronica) I love to listen to this cd. It is great, but don't buy it if you are looking for ska."
3,what happened,"needless to say the pietasters are up there with hepcat, lets go bowling, and the scoflaws with the pinical of third wave ska. which is itself riddled with some really bad punk with an identity crisis (Orange county scene) but enough of that back to the point of this review... the pietasters live cds and the ground breaking Oolooolooo (or whatever its called) rock seriously they kick ass and show a lot of talent and style, but what the hell happened. i walk into my local cd store, ragin' records and was stoked out of my ska loving gord when i saw a new pietasters album!! i poped it in and hearded the voice of the marboro man, he sounded aweful and what seemed to be a cool ska-soul blend was slaughtered. the cd grew on me--a little but i miss ""girl take it easy"", ""pleausre bribe"", and ""can i change my mind"" so do yourself a favor, save your money and your faith in the pietasters musical talent and pick up stapped live... you'll enjoy it much more"
2,Great Band - Bad Album,"The Pietasters are one of my favorite ska bands, but this is just not the Pietasters I know and love. Steve's once soulful voice suddenly sounds like a 60 year old man who's smoked too many cigarettes. Plus, half the songs on the CD have previously been released and were redone on Willis, only worse! Luckily, this album was just one bad apple and all the other Pietasters releases are great! Check out Strapped Live or Oolooloo to see them at their best."
3,090602 Peter Green,"Many nice basic blues tracks but the album was marred by most of the ""bonus"" intermittent practice sessions."
4,"!st Fleetwood Mac Album, Recorded 1967, Released 1968.","The original Fleetwood Mac played the blues, certainly much better than most UK bands at that time.Despite Mick Fleetwood and John McVie providing the group's name, this is known as Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac.Having said that another guitarist, Jeremy Spencer, also contributed songs to add of those by Green and covers of US blues tunes.To choose a standout is easy, Green's I Loved Another Woman, it has to heard to be appreciated.The remainder are not too far behind in quality, so there is much to enjoy, although the stop start nature of the recordings take some getting used to."
2,Rich JOCO Boys trying to be hip,There music was and still is very trendy. I grew up in Leawood. Trying to act street in the suburbs never will be cool. Whether they were into Ska when it resurged in the 90's or trying to be the the White Stripes today. They still stink and aren't the rebels they try to be. You have to live it for there to be meaning. Creating a false image and copying others doesn't cut it.
5,the gadjits DO rule,"i saw this band open for hepcat and the slackers about 1 1/2 years ago, the crowd sucked and wasn't into it at all, but i absolutely fell in love with the gadjits.. they put on a really energetic show and the music is just great. this cd is a wonderful combination of ska and soul, i think (without the horns)."
4,a great stylist,"There are many compilations of the great songs written by Mexico's Armando Manzanero. When an artist is as talented as Manzanero is as a songwriter one can't expect, nor demand ""great pipes"" or the voice of a Bocelli or Pavoratti. But, like Burt Bacharach, Manzanero's voice makes up in passion and heartfelt emotion what in may lack in pure vocal power. It takes a moment to ""get used"" to Manzanero's voice but then the style and beauty of his interpretation makes you love it all the more. These are his most famous hits but the arrangements, synthesizers, and piano playing are especially mesmerizing."
5,B000002E9H,Armando manzanero eres divino me fascina toda tu musica quiero tener pronto tu nueva produccion eres otro principe de la cancion.
2,loq nos dicen los angeles,no muy bueno los consejos q trae son muy comunes y note alludan demasiado. en resumen no te alluda espiritualmente
5,Lo que nos dicen los angeles,"This product was on mint condition (I bought it use), Doreen Virtue has been a real inspiration on my life, I totally recommend this book... is beautiful"
3,Feels like it was thrown together,"This book feels like it was thrown together quickly to cash in on the Ajax craze. The various chapters don't really flow together that well. It seems like they were written independently and then they threw in ""For more information on <whatever> see chapter <whatever>"". Some of the chapters were pretty good for getting started, like the stuff about XMLHttpRequest. But others lacked enough information to be useful on their own (like the one on XPATH and XSLT). The book may be useful to get a survey of a bunch of the technologies behind Ajax and how to use Asp.net, but I don't think this book will stand the test of time."
4,Get Under the Hood or Jump Right In,"Wrox continues to produce pragmatic books. This book is very traditional in its approach. It starts with a history of Ajax and goes quickly into describing how Ajax works (under the hood). I am a HUGE proponent of knowing how things work, even if there is a framework around it. As such, I really like this book's approach.Building on the foundation of the basics, the book describes the frameworks for implementing Ajax. It focuses (obviously) on the ASP.NET implementations called ""Atlas"" (now simply referred to as Asp.Net Ajax). The book does cover other frameworks as well.I recommend this book for learning about Ajax under the hood. It will be beneficial whether or not you work in .NET. The book is not very big and if you are looking for an understanding of the inner workings of client-side XML and JavaScript then this book is for you."
1,You Get What you Pay For,Cheap price. Cheap product. Install was a chore but not terrible. Within in weeks the glass was broken. Do not buy this product. Spend a little more and get better quality.
5,The Best Fruit Cake!,"On a scale of 1 to 100, I rate this cake 100. It is by far the best fruit cake I have ever tasted. No bitter taste. Full of Nuts and Cherries and Pineapple. I will buy this cake every year, not only for my self but for all my family. By the way I have 24 in my immediate family."
5,not a cement fruitcake!,"I am actually one of the few who actually likes fruitcake. I got this oneon-line because I couldn't find any at my local stores. It is fabulous !! moist, flavorful and delicious. I'm not even waiting for ""the season"" anymore I plan on always having it on hand. I would say try it, it just might make fruitcake lovers out of all."
2,Boring boring boring,"This book was dull and uninteresting. There is not much action and even less plot. There are several graphic sex scenes sprinkled throughout the book. I found myself reading the first sentence of paragraph after paragraph waiting for the author to get on with the story. I eventually concluded that he really didn't have much story to get on with. On the positive side, all the words are spelled correctly and the punctuation is fine."
3,"SciFi for the teenage boy, but R rated...","The Tranquility Wars, by Gentry Lee, is soft scifi with a R-rated twist. Future human worlds in this solar system have two primary governments (those colonies inside Mars orbit, and those outside), with ""pirates"" living within and between. One young man, a rising star in one system, is captured by pirates. Over the course of the book, he sees an alternative perspective toward life, and gets a chance to be reunited with his original system. In the meantime, the ""Utopian"" pirates introduce him to mucho sex and drugs. Females in this book are basically folk to have sex with. As I stated, this has ""teenage boy"" written all over it.Good for one time around. Not a classic"
2,Dissapointing,"Lee has learned some of the basics - get the reader's interest, make a character that the reader can like, get in some good scenery, some action, and some sex.What he didn't learn, however, was the rest of what makes a satisfying book. The main character doesn't grow or develop (we're *told* that he's changed, but he doesn't act any different), and he's whiney. He throws in sex scenes to plaster over plot holes/lack of plot development. Tehani is far more interesting than Hunter, but she's relegated to Sex Interest. And the ending...very disappointing.I wanted to red ink the whole thing and send it back to him. I wouldn't read it twice. This is a slapdash piece of work."
2,Shallow and boring,"I had forgotten what I didn't like about Lee's Rama books until I began reading this. The Rama books were all full of underdeveloped, oversexed characters.This book was heavily laced with gratuitous sex and nothing but gratuitous sex... There was no plot, there were no characters. I read about 100 pages, put the book down and picked up the Orson Scott Card book I had waiting.When I finally got the nerve to finish the book I found even more gratuitous sex and even less plot. I did manage to finish the book... well, I think I finished it. I'm wondering if there may have been missing pages at the end or maybe one or twelve missing chapters. There was no climax to the book (well, so to speak) and the ending just... well... ended.Unless the author is planning a sequel to answer all the questions left at the end of this book (like ""what was the plot?"") don't waste your time. You'll be disappointed."
4,A good story from a good author,"An engaging story... This is one of those books that you just can't put down! An excellent work of Science Fiction... and a plausible outlook on things to come. Save this one for vacation... otherwise, you will not get any sleep!"
4,Ranma - simply the best,"This stuff is definetely the best from Rumiko Takahashi. The first edition is very funny even though the quality of the drawings reches not the level of the OVAs. Everyone should watch these in the subbed mode (japanese with english subtitles), because the dubbed version is simply HORRIBLE, even worse than the movies or the OVAs. I've never heard such bad pronounciation, it simply sounds like these guys were reading their text from the sheet for the very first time. But the story is GREAT. Unfortunately there is no bonus stuff."
3,What the heck!?!?!,"I would have given the show more stars, as it is indeed excellent and deserving of praise. BUT, the dvd set of this from Amazon came with a bad disc. My fourth disc is just color bar test patterns. NO EPISODES AT ALL. What a crock and a waste of money. Now i gotta go find the last couple of episodes elsewhere. I hope no one else had this problem. I hope the rest of the seasons dont have this issue."
2,Off to a weak start.,"After seeing all of the other parts of the Ranma 1/2 anime, I was so disapointed in this one. It is obvious why the series was almost cancelled in Japan, as the writers didn't really feel how to get the series together adapting Takahashi's series, as with most writers trying to work a series out when it starts. They slaughtered the characters of Ranma and Akane in this one, as it seems Ranma's always making a rude comment and Akane's hitting Ranma every ten seconds. It's also obvious that the dub actors are really trying to get the feel of the original characters, just check out Ranma's voice in the English version(he sounds awful!) compared to the Japanese version. I think it would be best to skip this one."
2,I could do better than this,"I guess you could chalk this up to being spoiled by far more superior anime. The artwork is rather shoddy and I'm sorely disappointed by the English dubbing cast. The lead characters of Ranma and Akane are the worst. If I had the means to do it, I'd dub this anime myself."
5,Greatest anime series EVER,"After collecting all the VHS versions of seasons 1-5 and all the DVDs for season 6. I think its safe to say Ranma 1/2 is my favorite anime series of all time. Im sure u know the story boy turns to girl, man turns into a panda, and so on so Im not going to repeat it. If you dont have the VHS version get this set, if you do have the VHS version, get this set anyway, I know I am!"
4,Ranma,"I liked it a lot (but then again i'm a big fan of anime) 'cause it is uncut and the quality (video) is great, altought i would like best quality in the DVD itself and the box, those little books that all DVD's have that contain interesting stuff (like those on the Simpsons DVD's) were missing; I give it 4 stars for those reasons not that they matter a lot in the actual playing/viewing."
2,Read Write CD,"I was expecting a pack of three CD's for the money that I have paid. But, I did receive only a single CD. I have not tried rewriting yet."
3,You really should buy it whole and grind it yourself.,"To get the most benefits out of your extremely shelf-unstable flax seeds, you really should buy them whole and grind them yourself (I have a coffee mill for only this purpose). However, that is not always convenient, so buying already milled seeds is an option. For milled seeds, this isn't the tastiest or the freshest I've had--Bob's Red Mill pre-milled flax seeds taste much fresher, and the seeds aren't milled to a near powder. You can still see some texture and shape. These seeds are okay, but don't really add any flavor or depth. Go with Bob's or mill your own."
5,Great product,"It's flax meal. Healthy. Easy to add to an endless variety of foods. Non-offensive taste. I haven't had any problems with Hodgson Mill's milled flax seed, and, with Subscribe and Save, it's probably the cheapest of any product I've seen--but only by a fraction of a penny or so since I started shopping at Costco. And the one at Costco is organic. And, while the package at Costco is a bulk item, it's not as big as eight 12-oz boxes. I really hate to say it since it's a great product with no discernable defects and *ALMOST* the best value I can find anywhere, but the organic flax at Costco wins in my opinion. If you don't have a Costco membership, or your location doesn't sell the organic flax, this is still definitely a great value (and probably the first runner up)."
2,Great for baking? but not in my hot cereal,"Now that I have been eating other brand milled flax seeds, when I tasted this one, it tasted very bland and not tasty. I had to cancel future subscriptions. For eating in hot cereal, Trader Joe's brand is much better although I realize that Hodgson's is a great quality product."
4,Good Health Search,"I bought this item to assist my own health overrall, I also made some of the 8 count boxes, Gifts over the Holidays to help them out too. A great purchase I made here."
5,Good and good for you,"I started using milled flax a few years ago...at least two tablespoons on my cereal, wife puts in her smoothies. Can't find it in the local grocers so was pleased to see it on Amazon. Look up the nutritional data...super stuff."
3,just okay,I had an electric one and you cannot compare this to that...it doesnt make that much foam and it disappears fast...
4,Almost,Over all it was good. It took me several weeks to watch all six DVDs and when I got to the sixth it was actually a second copy of the 5th dvd. It was past the return date and it cost me $33 to get the sixth on single copy.
2,"Great to see it, but DVD quality is VERY sub-par","The menus and extras are 'ok', but the actual show's quality is horrible. Massive amounts of mpeg artifacts all over the place. It's great to see the show on DVD.I don't buy that this is old and the quality suffers as a result. The qulity is poor because the authoring of the DVD was poor."
2,Have I changed or the series?,"I remember being enthralled with this series when it came on TV years ago; it was the one show that my son and I would not miss. We awaited each new installment with great anticipation.So we decided to purchase this series of discs when they were offered; they (the discs) were expensive, but you know what those good memories are like...well, they sometimes have a way of clouding sound judgement.And with the result...What a disappointment; what a bore! Have I changed that much with time? I fail to understand how this series could have, at one time, enamoured me so much. Now, this childish, immature cartoon series, that I once thought was so great, has me shaking my head in disbelief.One of the other reviewers, seemed to indicate that something had been left out; maybe so, because something seems different. But then, maybe it's me. In any event, a major letdown! 2 Stars...1 Star (because it's the least available) plus 1 Star for the memories."
3,Not perfect but not terrible either,"I was a big L7 fan back in the early to mid '90s. While everyone was into Nirvana and Pearl Jam, I was into L7. I felt that L7 was vastly superior to Nirvana and Pearl Jam. I bought everything L7-related that I could get my grubby hands on. Before drummer Dee Plakas joined the band, L7 actually had a male drummer (as if that would make any difference since the production on this cd was awful). I eventually bought their self-titled debut album. I have to admit that this was not the band's best album. Brett Gurewitz's production was less than stellar. Their sound on this album was pretty bad. The songs on the cd were not nearly as catchy as what I heard on ""Smell the Magic"" and ""Bricks Are Heavy"". Nevertheless there were some songs that I did like on this album like ""Cat-O'Nine-Tails"" and ""Metal Stampede"". The self-titled debut album by L7 may not be their best work but I have heard much worse music by other artists/bands than this album."
2,Not for Dummies,"This is a pretty decent book for those with some previous programming experience, but is definitely not for beginners (or Dummies) to programming. The first 2 chapters contain terms and concepts that assume an existing knowledge base."
3,Oddly organized,"This book is helpful for some concepts, and has certainly helped me with a few programming issues I've had, but I am not a fan of the tough in cheek titles for chapters, it is confusing. I feel like the whole book is oddly organized, but once you get over that part, it is decent."
3,"Interesting, I think I will use PHP more","This is the usual ""Dummies"" style book that you can use to either learn Python, or learn about Python, the latter being what I did."
5,Typically great,"A typically great 'Dummies' book covering the basics of the Python programming language up to version 2.5. The examples are similar to the online tutorial, and the text flows smoothly for an easy read. The book also offers programming tips and some insight into using the Idle IDE and SQL. It does not cover GUI commands or Iron Python (the .NET version).Be sure to type enough of the examples to get used to the Python syntax while you're learning the structure.Tip: the free Notepad++ program also has Python syntax coloring and formatting capability under the 'Language' tab."
1,Love Steelers but not this rug!,This is 1 item I returned. I was not happy with the quality of this product at all. It was very light weight and thin and did not lay nice on floor. Would not recommend for anyone to purchase this. I had purchased it for my son's bedroom but was not happy with it at all.
4,My grandson loves it -- cool!,"I used to play Pacman years and years ago, so I was delighted when my Grandson asked for it for his birthday. He loves it, and we've even played it together which he gets a kick out of -- and so do I. ('Course I would rather he'd be playing outside with other kids instead of having his nose pressed up to his Gameboy or the computer screen, but his parents do a good job of limiting his video play time.) Long live PacMan!"
2,WHAT A GYP,"I purchased this out of excitement that I would finally learn the truth to the controversy around the series' validity. Man, what a disappointment! They only devulge about three scenes, and pack the rest with filler, such as stock footage from the other films, and stupid commentary by horrible actors (noteably Dr. Louis Flellis). Don't bother to waste your money like I did. You're better off reading the various online critiques on the films' fakeness. You'll get much more info that way.--J.C. Hoyt"
5,Came from crochet heaven,"This book has very nice patterns, some of them are found everywhere, some of them are rare. The patterns are easy to follow, I haven`t seen any mistakes yet. It`s a good reference book to look up the patterns, and also a good experimentation book to challenge yourself with the tough patterns once in a while. Highly recomended!(All these apply to V6)."
4,A terrific book of ideas,"I love the clear close-up photos of the finished product, which help me decide if I want to try making it. A great book for those trying to design their own shawls, scarves or sweaters and just need a good idea to get started.I like having the diagrams under each pattern. I follow those much better than the written instructions. Most of the patterns don't repeat simply on every row. They tend to take several rows to repeat. Beginners should gain a little more experience before attempting."
5,Robi Rosa es un genio en todos los aspectos,"Imaginensen una mezcla entre la poesia de Jim Morrison, las guitarras de Jimi Hendrix y Led Zeppelin, la psicodelia de Pink Floyd y Jane's Addiction y el personaje de Perry Farrell. Todas estas cosas juntas crean un musico, compositor, productor y poeta llamado Robi ""draco cornelius"" Rosa un personaje muy oscuro y mal entendido pero mas importante un GENIO en todos los significados de la palabra. Sus liricas muy oscuras y su musica psicodelica te hacian viajar hacia otra dimension. Vagabundo es un perfecto ejemplo de esto. MUSICA PARA VOLAR tiene canciones rapidas como VERTIGo hasta canciones lentas como blanca mujer. En mi opinion Robi Rosa es el mejor musico en Latinoamerica. SI les gusta Robi deberian escuchar Soda Stereo y ALice in Chains"
5,EL MEJOR!!!!!!!,"UNO DE MIS CD FAVORITOS ADEMAS DE FRIO Y DE SONGBIRDS&ROOSTER ES VAGABUNDO, POR LA ESTUPENDA LETRA QUE CONTIENEN TODAS SUS CANCIONES. ROBI ROSA ES EL MEJOR ESCRITOS QUE EXISTE ACTUALMENTE EN EL MUNDO"
2,Not what I was specting,I saw Draco on a tv show and I liked the song he played so I read some reviews looking for a CD and I ended up ordering Vagabundo. I did not like any of the songs from that CD. His lirics and music are not that great.
3,"Good stories, but too much sex.","It's a shame that good, funny supernatural tales have gone so far toward erotica. At least these are shelved with Romance books. The best story in the book is ""A Fiend in Need"", which, depending on where the next ""Undead and..."" story picks up, might be a must-read for fans of the series. The rest have intersting concepts and characters, but seem like the author padded them to length with extremely explicit sex scenes. Too bad you can't get ""clean"" and ""explicit"" versions of books like you do CDs."
2,"DEAD AND LOVING IT, NOT QUITE....","THIS WAS NOT THE MARY JANICE DAVIDSON I WAS EXPECTING....I DIDN'T KNOW THESE FIRST 3 STORIES WERE ""E"" RELEASED AND WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THEM. THEY STILL HAD SOME OF THE WIT I EXPECTED, BUT EXCUSE ME, THE USE OF A COUPLE OF ""C"" WORDS THAT BELONG IN PORN, DID NOT IMPRESS ME. MY THOUGHT WAS HERE WE GO AGAIN, LAURELL K HAMILTONish SYNDROME...ANOTHER AUTHOR THAT I USE TO REALLY ENJOY BEFORE SHE WEIRDED OUT ON NO PLOT AND LOTS AND LOTS OF BANGING ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING THAT MOVES......"
4,Classic MJ,"The first three stories in this anthology are re-released E-Books from Ellora's Cave (an Erotic Romance Publisher)and pre-date UU by several years. Being EC releases, they had to provide a required amount of sex, 'nuff said. They are quite similar in plot/action, but MJ's strength has always been in her characters and dialog.That aside, the vamp/were mythos of the first 3 don't quite mesh with the Betsyverse they pre-date.The last story is new and a does integrate the rules she's written for both 'verses. It will be interesting to see if she continues to have these two universes interact."
4,mixed emotions,"(Santa Claws, Monster Love, There's No Such Thing as a Werewolf, A Fiend in Need)This novel consists of multiple stories - all penned by MaryJanice Davidson. Davidson has incorporated some of her story themes and melded them into one world - combining vampires with the werewolves. I enjoyed most of them and I read all of them, but I have to admit distaste for MONSTER LOVE. I won't give away the story, but I found it disturbing and somewhat insulting, which I have never encountered with her work before now. On the flip side, I heartily agree with her non-conformist view of what is attractive about women's bodies and their self-images in SANTA CLAWS. My favorite, however, is A FIEND IN NEED, which brings us all back into the world of Betsy, Queen of the Vampires. Despite my negative experience, I eagerly await more of her work - the positive far outweighs the negative."
2,What a waste of money....,At least Davidson in her other books attempted a storyline and plot. In this book she just unleases her inner potty mouth and fills the pages with clit references and throbbing members. I'm wondering if she just isn't awfully horny because she didn't even try to disguise these stories as anything more than Playgirl meets Harliquin Romance.
5,A terrific slice of Mary Janice,"I'm a big MJ fan and if you've read her other books, this antho makes sense. If you haven't you may not appreciate it as you should."
3,Loving it if dead ;),"There are great works of western liturature that will change your life. This ain't it, On the other hand if you want a good beach read or a great bit of fluf this is likly to be your cup of tea, it has Vampires, wearwolfs, santa clause and other things that ought to exzist. Lite love storys that are a great read once. If you become a fan of the author you might want to buy and keep it. but if not you will know a friend that you must lend it to."
1,"I LOVE the Undead series, so this was disappointing","I thoroughly enjoyed the ""Undead and..."" series starting with ""Undead and Unwed"" by MJD. I bought this book to read poolside on vacation was looking forward to it so much. So disappointed. Not only did I discover, as other reviewers, that this was basically the same short story told 4 times, but the sex stuff...blech. The sex in this book was not passionate or loving, it was graphic and brutal. I skipped over several paragraphs because reading about a woman enjoying being forced to have her ""C"" (yes that's the word) attacked - just didn't do it for me. It was somewhat offensive. I know many of the characters were supposed to be monsters - vampire, werewolves. etc, but these were females being raped - then falling in love!"
2,Save your money...,"Other reviewers have given the story outlines so I won't waste time repeating them.Suffice it to say, thank goodness I borrowed this from the library rather than spending actual money on it. I have enjoyed Davidson's ""Betsy"" books over the years but these stories come no where near the level of those books. Perhaps if each of the stories were longer and more developed - and eliminated a lot of the gratuitous sex - I might have enjoyed them better. As it is, I was not disappointed when I finished the book, only surprised that I had actually finished it."
4,Vacation Read,"Other reviewers have done a great job of summarizing the stories, so I'll skip that and say that this would be a great book to read on vacation, at the beach, on a lazy day. It's not heavy on plot, but I liked the characters quite a bit. The first three stories were apparently published before --- I missed them --- and the last story brings Antonia (the prophetess werewolf from ""Derik's Bane"") together with Betsy the Vampire Queen's posse."
2,DEAD AND NOT LOVING IT,"THIS WAS NOT THE MARY JANICE DAVIDSON I WAS EXPECTING EITHER AND I LOVE AND COLLECT ALL HER BOOKS....I WAS DISAPPOINTED. SOME PARTS OF THE STORIES WERE FUN AND WITTY BUT 90% WAS ALL SEX! AND FORCED SEX? FALLING IN LOVE WITH SOME ONE THAT RAPED YOU? THAT WASN'T WORKING FOR ME! I WAS ALSO SAYING HERE WE GO AGAIN, LAURELL K HAMILTONish (AND I LOVE ANITA BLAKE) SYNDROME...ANOTHER AUTHOR THAT I LOVE AND THEN SHE STARTED PUTTING OUT BOOKS WITH NO PLOT AND LOTS AND LOTS OF BANGING ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING THAT MOVES...... SEX DOES SELL BUT SO DOES GREAT WRITING! GET BACK TO MORE STORY!!"
2,Erotica,I am not sure I will be buying anymore MJD books I love the stories and her humor but quite frankly I can do without the porn sex scenes I feel she is doing herself a disservice by coming down to that level.
1,Blech,"I bought this book the day it became available, and was horribly disappointed. The stories all follow a similar theme: boy meets girl, boy is instantly attracted to girl, boy has mind-blowing sex with girl, and girl decides that based on that, they're perfect for each other. If you're looking for tons of gratuitous sex, this is the book for you. If you're looking for a little more in the way of plot, you may want to look elsewhere.One story that disturbed me was ""Monster Love,"" in which the hero kidnaps and rapes his lady love. Eeeewwww! How is this supposed to be romantic? Maybe it's just me, but a story with a woman falling in love with her rapist is just plain repulsive.The only bright spot is the last story which features George the Fiend from the Undead series. I did enjoy learning a little bit about George's background. It would have been a bit more enjoyable if George's love interest was a little more appealing."
2,Not Up to Her Standards,"I am a huge fan of MaryJanice Davidson's ""Undead"" series. She can make me laugh out loud with every line. This particular book was below her usual standards. I feel she sacrificed story for crude sex scenes. Come on MaryJanice you are so much better than this.....I don't mind love/sex scenes in my paranormal romances.....but next time...put some kind of story in there please."
5,excellent anthology,"***** ""Santa Claws"". Scottish werewolf in town to pay tribute to the new heir runs across a woman dressed as Santa. Great blend of humor and burning-hot steam. Plus, there's a shout-out to Emma Holly, which is way cool.***** ""Monster Love"". Ooooh, a combo! Betsy-vamp meets Wyndham werewolf. Hot and hilarious, and daring. Not many authors can write a bondage & rape scenario and still make me root for the hero.***** ""There's No Such Thing as a Werewolf"". A blind werewolf doctor meets a younger woman who just has this feeling that she should be able to fly, and he can suddenly see her.***** ""A Fiend in Need"". Yes! Another combo! Antonia, the seer, non-Changing werewolf from Derik's Bane, and George the Fiend from the Betsy books."
3,Not bad for a first athology,"Dead and Loving It is the first anthology by MJD, the first three stories feature the werewolf pack from the book, Derik's Bane and the fourth features both the vampires from the Undead series and one of the werewolves.All four stories are romances and are cute and funny to read. From the werewolf that finds his mate in a Santa suit by her scent; to the vampire that finds and almost loses his werewolf love when he doesn't believe her when she tells him what she is; along with a fairy that can't fly and a blind werewolf and a feral vampire and a psychic werewolf who doesn't change.It's a cute, funny book but I liked Dead Over Heels much more."
1,Look elsewhere for Italian instruction.,"I took this course and I found it virtually worthless as an instructional tool. The author seems solely bent upon teaching pronunciation alone and goes really overboard when explaining how this or that is pronounced. Hundreds of pages and many tapes are spent drilling in the ideosyncracies of the Italian language as it is pronounced. These are things one would digest as a natural part of the learning process. Italian is one of the easiest languages to pronounce anyway. The course doesn't have many drills or repetitive exercises nor does it offer extensive grammer information. Everything a beginning speaker would need to have just a basic conversational level by the end of the course is missing. Incidentally, both the German and French versions of this series are excellent. I don't know how they could have missed the boat on this one."
1,Complete waste of time,"I was truly disappointed with this course. After listening to the first few CDs, I realized that I had wasted over $75.00 on nothing more than one heck of a boring course on countless pronunciation drills--one cd after another. After the fourth CD, I did not want to pursue this nonesense any further. I wanted to get a reimbursement right then and there, if only it wasn't too late. I'll know better next time to read these reviews first.I learned French at home, minored in Spanish in college and taught myself Portuguese. So, I consider myself a serious student of the romance languages. And after taking a basic course in Italian, which was truly a lot of fun, I figured I was rest ready to do the rest on my own. But contrary to the hyped blurb, this Barrons course was truly a flop. Save your dollars!!"
1,Arg! Pronunciation will drive you crazy.,"I will sell you mine for 1/2 price.Even if you are just at a beginner in italian, this course will drive you insane. If you make it though the first 2 tapes you are a saint.Save your money (or buy my copy), get Michel Thomas's CDs or Pimsleur (if you are serious about learning italian).This goes way beyond what is needed in pronunciation...unless you want to specialize in only pronunciation :-)"
1,Dreadful!!!,I am flabbergasted by this so called mastering Italian book/cd. It was pure waste of my money!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Didn't work upon opening the box,This was shipped to us as a gift to our school. We are all female teachers who are not electronic geeks but who can at least read instructions. We put the wheels on easily. But we really felt bad when we plugged it inand couldn't get ANY response....The instruction manual was no help....too little information. So it sataround until my husband could look at it.Response: It doesn't work. Some integral part appears to be burned or a dud. Defective on delivery....only the delivery was over 2 months ago! What do I do now?We really need that equipment at our school!Did this happen to any of you?
2,U.S BOMBS CALI/77/STREET/PUNK,"This CD is pure Cali punk. Its alright, but personally to much drug tal"
5,great album,"when i first listened to this i was hooked right away to the sound that the bombs were sending.my friend gave me this cd cause he got annoyed of dwayne's style of singing.i love it.war birth is pure '77 punk.go see 'em if you can live,they put on one hell of a show."
3,It's okay,"I liked 'Covert Action' better than this one. Music is such a personal thing you may think the opposite. For what it's worth, I think there's no big change here. It's pretty much the same really."
5,GREAT BOOK FOE ADULTS AND CHILDREN,"Audrey Penn does a great job explaining the way a child with ADD/ADHD has to cope with ADD/ADHD. The teacher in the book starts off by talking about walking in someone elses shoes. Although it is hard to understand ADD/ADHD if you don't have it, this book shows a great example of what it is like to have ADD/ADHD. My husband and I read it in the pediatricians office and then bought it for our son. I also recommend this book to teachers to read to there students."
1,"I'm ok, you're ok, let's all celebrate...","...and have a good time. I suppose this ""author"" was trying to promote the message that it's not little ""Jimmy's"" fault that he's a reckless little monster who tries to destroy the lives of those around him. Whatever Jimmy feels like getting away with, let him now attribute to his A.D.D. But mommy, but teacher, it was only my A.D.D. acting up. Ohhhh, ok then Jimmy, go about your business as usual.Then there's the issue of the ""teacher"" having the kids put ladybugs down the kids shirts. Ok. Putting aside the deviant tendancies there, why not put ants in their pants? Then, why not shove bamboo rods under their fingernails? Brilliant idea.This is a horrible little tale, one designed only to continue the current line of no-one should be accountable for their actions - it's all the fault of something else - kind of thinking. Furthermore, it's done by an ""author"" who can scarcely string together two sentences.Avoid at all costs."
3,Women's boxing gloves,"These gloves are cute, but a a tight fit. I have small hands, and the medium is REALLY snug. The wrist wrap is good, allows for good support. This company was great to deal with, i originally bought a size small, but returned to get a size medium and they were cooperative and had good customer service."
1,Made of inferior material,"I purchased the Valeo GLBW Women's Leather Bag Gloves with Wristswrap. These gloves are made of a very inferior grade of leather. I have only worn and used these glove twice and the leather is already peeling off. I can see the padding on one glove. I thought leather was suppose to be more durable. I would return them, but I have tried returning an item to Amazon.com before and I usually end up with nothing after all of the deductions. I am going the seriously rethink what I buy from Amazon.com in the future. If I am going to be stuck with a product, I would like it to last beyond 2 uses."
1,Poor Customer Service,"I ordered these gloves but never received them. There was no way to contact the seller when my tracking number revealed the gloves had left for delivery but were never scanned again. I could only talk with Amazon themselves and was told that I had to wait 14 days after the estimated delivery date, before Amazon could refund my money or have another pair of gloves sent out. If the seller could have been contacted directly maybe this would have been handled better."
3,Valeo Kick Boxing Gloves,"These gloves are inexpensive, perhaps for good reason. I've been using them for a month now and they are already ripping at the seams. Luckily they haven't come apart completely yet. They also leave a pinkish stain on the wrists and sides of the fingers after class, from the dye. Other than that, they are pretty comfortable and I will continue to use them until they completely unravel."
2,"Soft, but a pain to make the bed!","Yes, this blanket is soft but I'm surprized that no one mentioned that it has two layers. When making the bed, the layers didn't stay together and one layer invariably wrinkled and I had to return it. If you're like me and refuse to sleep on wrinkles, look into Serasoft by Birkshire, it is thicker, one layer and just as soft if not more so."
5,Pure luxury!,"This is THE blanket!!! I have ordered several of the ""micro-mink"" type blankets, only to return them disappointed, but this one is the keeper, and the best by far!!! I bought two of these, one for my son's bed and one for ours, and got a throw for the couch! LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT! You won't be disappointed with the softness, and the weight is slightly heavy, which I personally love. Great blanket!"
3,Bad Religion is my favorite band...,"and i love their older material; however, i can't give this CD 5 stars. I think this sounds too much like a re-hash of Suffer. I don't understand those who will only listen to 80-85, Suffer, No Control, and Against the grain. Their later CD's have much depth than the early material. I know this makes me un-punk, but i don't give a (deleted). This CD is good but don't ever let anyone convince you that Bad Religion reached their peak in 1989."
1,I don't like this CD,"Am I the only person to really really dislike this CD? Seriously people, all the songs on this CD sound exactly the same! And how can you call this punk? Punk is stuff like the Sex Pistols and the Clash and Dead Kennedys. Individually, I like the songs. But they are all the same! I think Bad Religion should at least try to get a new sound. i like the lyrics, but I hate the vocalist and the rhythms.I'm sorry, but this CD was a total waste of money."
3,"""Give all the idiots a brand new religion""","Not my favorite Bad Religion album, although I've listened to it much less than others, so that may be why. I love the song ""I Want to Conquer the World"", with Greg's voice so unique and raw."
5,All Hail Bad Religion!,"Pennywise, Blink 182, Rancid, you owe your success to Bad Religion. These guys are the reason punk rock is still around. Essential listening."
4,Enjoyment,The seventh season is very enjoyable although it seems to be setting up for season 8 where Bud has to recover from his injuries.
5,Great season,It was a very good series. Really enjoyed the new twist and turns that this season took. The season cliffhanger has a real dramatic ending. Can hardly wait to purchase the next season to see what happens.
2,bad picture quality,"Today I got the seventh season of JAG. Unfortunately, I had to realize that the picture quality is very bad - there is lots of artifacting (I think the bitrate of the encoding is way too low - there are now 5 episodes per disc).If you watch the series on an hdtv-projector you can see lots of noise around edges. This was not the case with the dvd releases of previous seasons. This is very disappointing. The series itself is wonderful."
2,"7th season of Jag, first disc","The first disc of the 7th season of Jag is defective. How do I go about getting it replaced?Do you have provisions for replacing defective merchandise?Robert B. Bashein4509 Oak Manor Drive #73Fort Worth, TX 76116bashfw@aol.com"
1,Never Again,This was the most horrible experience I have had on this site. First of all I never received my order. When the date it was supposed to be here came and went I had to email the seller 2x before I got any kind of response as to where my order was. He then sent me an email telling me maybe I should look up Amazon's terms & conditions and gave me the tracking #. When I looked up the tracking# it said it had been delivered but I never received it. I emailed the seller 2 more times to confirm the address they shipped to and asked if they would be willing to file a claim for me with the postal service for lost mail (as only the mailer can do this) and I still have not heard back. I will never order anything from this seller again!!
3,"Started Lagging, Stopped Jagging!","Perhaps it just went a season or two too long but this season of Jag was not exciting but was just more of the same, unreal stories, often just dull. (sort of like the most recent season of NCIS.) I expected more of this series. They either should have kept up the story-telling or stoped the show before it got to this point. Still watchable."
5,JAG: Judge Advocate General- The Seventh Season,This is one of the best shows that was on TV I really enjoyed it when it was on and am now enjoying it now that I have it on DVD.
5,JAG TV Series,"I didn't watch JAG, the TV series when it first aired. I watch it now on Satellite and I purchased the 10 season collection. I find it is the only thing on TV that holds my interest, episode after episode. I missed having the Admiral show up for the finale. He should have been there. I enjoy all of the characters and their interaction with each other. The actors are all terrific, especially David James Elliot and Catherine Bell. They have a great chemistry. I also like Bud because he is funny and lends a good comic relief sometimes. Someone should put a bug in the ear of the Bellisario Productions to (at the very least) make a movie showing what the characters are doing now. The show has been over for 6 years so it's about time they do a follow-up using the original actors. JAG should be brought back!!."
4,The Violet Fariy Book,"Submittted by Pamela Kekst: I thought that the Violet Fairy Book was very well written and fun to read. The book is made up of many different short stories, all of them are fairy tales. Each has its own problem and solution. They all had their own setting as well. One of my favorite stories is called The Finest Liar in the World. It takes place at the edge of the wood. It is about a boy telling a story to an old man for a lying face-off. I liked the book because each story was different so you could never get bored reading the book. It was also very interesting because of all the strange pictures in the book. I would only give the book a 4 star rating, however, as sometimes the stories could be hard to follow. I recommend this book for any one that likes fairy tales."
4,Awesome,Very strong powerful clear and precise lyrics as well as beats.You will be moved with flow and uptempo music on this cd. Its worth the listerning experience and will hit home.Music Director: Arthur P.
3,Generic and general,"The manual is generic - trying to cover a lot of varying models and both 2 and 4 stroke.The paper quality and photos are poor and often hard to see the detail. SOme of hte other Haynes manuals I have are much better,but this one seems especailly bad.Overall, useful as a guide, but only if you can't get soemthingmre specific to your bike."
4,scooter manual,this book provides all the info you need to disassemble and rebuild most scooter motors as well as tips and methods to make it easier
2,needed more pictures,"not enough pictures,nothing to help with on working on scooter,needed more pictures more undrestanding about the book to work on scooter."
5,Just Wonderful,"Although I don't raise sheep I know people who do, and they tell me that this book is still an excellent resource. I bought the book because I thought it was charming, as old books so often are. I loved holding it in my hands, and looking at the photographs to see how things were and still are done."
1,"Be ware, it requires 4x8 paper size cassette","This requires 4x8 paper side cassette. Thought it said it's compatible with Selphy cpxxx, you can't print without having the 4x8 cassette to load your paper in."
2,Blech!!,"A cluttered, hyperactive world beat album, mixing rock, salsa, funk, ska, and less-definable Brazilian elements. It's all too jittery and unsubtle for me to latch onto. In fact, I'd say it's pretty awful; definitely a disappointment considering the creative potential heard on earlier albums."
5,Good compilation of ska and punk,"If you wanna here some old time punk, ska, and reggae then buy Give 'em the boot. It has some popular bands giving it their best to please the fans! And hey, it's cheap too!"
4,Get 'em,"This album and it's brethren are an excellent way to be introduced to a lot of cool bands. I've gone out and bought a number of albums based on what I heard here and on Vol. II + III. If you like punk and ska with a dash of psychobilly, then this is your teaser!"
5,Great SKA (esp instrumentals!) and strong punk-great combo!,"Excellent and affordable. Hellcat Records did it again. This one has Hepcat , the Slackers, and the Dropkick Murphys and quite a lot in between -> way to stretch the spectrum and give us a high quality product!"
5,can't be beat,"This cd is great. Any one who has five bucks and doesn't own this cd should get it. It had a good mix with alot of good songs on it. The Dropkick Murphys sound great here as do the Slackers and US Bombs. The only thing that bums me out is that there isn't a second ""Give em the Boot!"""
2,Few good bands.,"Hellcat has a good list of bands here on this comp. The problem is, I'm not a fan of any of the bands, except for the Dropkick Murphys. Besides that, the only other song I liked was Rancid's. Union 13 did a great job of turning ""Roots Radicals"" into spanish...problem is, I liked singing along to that song. :)I'm not a fan of ""oi"". I don't even know what ""oi"" is. I'm not a huge fan of ska. Nor am I a fan of streetpunk. This is not a band album..it is just not what I enjoy listening to."
2,"Sorry, not at all impressed--it hurt my head!","Bought this based on glowing reviews here on Amazon. Hmmm...I don't get it. The whole CD is just annoying noise. I LOVE nice cello music, but this cannot be called ""cello music"". I guess its all the discordant notes that bothers my head and just becomes irritating. Honestly, one play of the CD left me with a headache. I was expecting something very different. Not my cup of tea, altho maybe its yours(??) I'm going back to my Liquid Mind CDs for something peaceful and soothing."
2,wait for the new,new review on the web was much better music then the old album... do not buy this wait for the new stuff to come out.
4,Amazing CD by a quirky cellist and composer,"Enjoyable music, but listening to the CD for the first time, I was sometimes distracted by the thoughts of, ""Wow, this is one person playing one instrument."" In other words, sometimes the performance got in the way of the music. There isn't any one track that grabbed me and said, ""This is great, it is one to add to my list of favorites, I will want to listen to this again."" But the entire CD is one that I will want to listen to often in the future."
2,Especially Annoying,"I love ""The Rugrats"" normally, but this annoyed me because of the character of the baby-sitter, who is voiced by Amanda Bines. She annoyed me. These are baby-enhanced versions of fairy tails, but I just think they could have been done better."
4,Great DVD,"This DVD is very well done. You will enjoy it if you are not from Senegal and want to learn more about the country and its customs. Even for us Senegalese, it is refreshing to see such a positive work about our country. I lost my DVD I am definitely buying another one to replace it."
2,Youssou N'Dour The world of Yousou N'Dour,"poor quality videograghy and the pace was off putting. The cover mentions peter Gabriel, Paul Simon and others leading one to believe that those collaborative efforts are on the dvd. They are not."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD,"Please don't waiste your money on this dvd. I know you will regret it. Everybody I know , hates this dvd . This dvd deals more with tourism than music. Eventhough it is released october30 th, 2001 you will not find new materials on this dvd.You will find 7 olds song and the clips are mix of drawings, still pictures.DO NOT BUY THIS DVD"
5,Music for all generations,I loved the way they play. The sound and songs are appealing to everyone from 5 to 85. These are very talented musicians not to be missed.I would like to see one of their shows.
2,... next?,"Maybe part of my problem is I didn't realize this book was highly fictionalized when I bought it, but I didn't care for it. If you don't mind that, and enjoy short stories where you don't ever really get to connect to the characters, this may be for you."
2,good prose but not original,"This book wasn't original enough and seemed like it took too many details from Suzanne Farrell's autobiography. Certain factual specifics that Ms. Farrell told about her relationship with Balachine were too unique and personal to be appropriately co-opted into a work of supposed fiction, particularly since their history is relatively recent. i have to wonder to what degree she took from other writers besides Ms. Farrell."
3,An almost too cleverly constructed rumination on parallax.,"By the author of ""The Music Lesson,"" this almost too cleverly constructed rumination on parallax (look it up!) seems to say two things: (1) we can never really know anyone else; (2) some people simply cannot be saved. The most haunting image is that of the Holocaust-survivor psychoanalyst smiling with infinite kindness at her seemingly blessed young patient, who has already decided to die. Common threads in this and The Music Lesson include death of a child; wisdom and generosity of spirit of the elderly who have suffered; Americans in European settings they don't fully understand; profound attachments between grown daughter and father; intelligent, affluent women caught up in passionate affairs that prove degrading or just plain dangerous. What I didn't like about this one were the extended digressions into Harriet's childhood; though poignant, they seemed largely irrelevant."
2,Disappointing,"I didn't quite understand when this was supposed to have taken place. For a woman in her 20's to be having an affair with a concentration camp survivor, he would have had to have been even older than her father if this was set in the last 30 years. The male character was married and had young children, so it was hard to get an idea of how old he was. I liked the character of Harriet but wasn't sure what her childhood relationship to her neighbors had to do with anything that happened later. Anne's character was annoying and I wasn't surprised at her demise in spite of her having reached out to others for help. The mirror and photography motifs throughout were interesting."
2,Lovely Writing But Flawed Overall,"I agree that Katharine Weber is a talented writer, however the book as a whole was uneven and by the end, uninspired. The photography imagery was overused often failed to conjure the picture [pitcher] or mood Weber seemed to be reaching for. The journal portion of the book was stunning; the third-person traditional narratives less so. In an attempt to create a novel as told through snapshots, Weber left me feeling unengaged and disinterested. Although I loved her word play and Harriet's voice in the beginning, I felt the novel ran out of steam and became much more pedestrian by its conclusion."
4,A review...and a novel...based on reason.,"The purpose of a book review is to discuss one's thoughts of story, technique, style. Katharine Weber exhibits tremendous talent for all of these. What a review should NOT do is act as an attack on an author. Despite someone's attempt to cloak opinions in a negative ""review"", any serious reader will recognize this as nothing more than a vendetta against a talented writer."
3,"well written, but disappointing ending","This book impressed me from the beginning with its carefully constructed language, subtle humor, and intricate weaving of sub-plots, however as the story progesses into an earlier stage in the protagonists' life, I felt disconnected from the initial story. The ending attempts to tie together many loose ends introduced by the sub-plots, but does not really succeed. I was disappointed by what appeared to be an excellent book from the beginning."
1,THE JOKE OF THE DECADE,"This, dear friends, is the most amazing book of the year 1995 ... and for probably another 95 years to come. It is kind of a Plan Nine From Outer Space"" with characters out of the mental hospital, a writing style that opens new, until now undiscovered dimensions in banality, and lots of other goodies: dialogue so utterly trite that it will make you wanna weep, self-important blah blah directly from the literary trashcan, imbecile wordplay - a laughable pastiche of talentless word processing, a novel without any idea, any meaning or topic. This author doesn't waste time with thoughts, themes, plot, insights. Every page is a new evidence for her procedure: Why should she?Miss Weber teaches writing at Yale. This is not only a grand mystery, but the joke of another 95 years to come. Let's all become scholars of Miss Weber, and let's create a new literature for a new, thought-free planet!"
1,disappointed,This are listed as canisters which I guess could be used as canisters. The only problem I has with them is that they are all the same size which is the size of a canister that is used for tea. The flour and sugar are the same size which is approximately 6 inches. Will probably be sending them back. Very cute just too small.
1,Bland Islamic history,"Viewed from 2009, this book published in 1958 is stale-dated; definitely passed its prime. The author wrote the book as a generic `background' book regarding Islam; it has no citations, no footnotes nor endnotes, with barely a bibliography. Although it frequently quoted from the Koran, no ayat citations were provided. If you are even casually familiar with Islam, you will learn nothing new within this book. The author opined that Islam would eventually somehow reform itself and allow Muslims to awake from the intellectual stupor that Islam has been encapsulated in since the 1500s. The author opined that eventually Islam would arose itself out of its lethargy and join in the `One World' enthusiasm that was so prevalent amongst the 'intelligencia' during the 1950s. After reading the book, I junked it."
4,Ivory Joe,Some of my most fondly remembered songs are here and some that I am not familiar with. I enjoy the album very much but was disappointed in some of the unfamiliar tunes.
1,dicourageing,"This CD is one of the worst music CDs i have ever bought. I did not reconize a few of the titles, and bought it anyways because of the low BPM. I am a aerobic instructor and thought it would be perfect for the abdominal segment. I would not have people of mixed gender listening to that dirty music in an exerciesed based class. It would be o star if could"
4,Overwhelming,"Can anyone truly digest all the knowledge in this book and its companion the Western Mysteries. It is impossible, but as references for whatever you indulge yourself they indisposible. If you want to figure out sanskrit or hebrew, either to write or number, or even to explore the magical implications of language, these books are a must for your bookshelf. You will find something useful for whatever path you follow."
5,Beautifully illustrated children's book,"I bought this book for friends with new babies, and they all loved it. The illustrations are incredible, and the storyline is engaging. Kids love the pictures and finding all the animals. I would recommend this book for both children and parents alike. It is an enjoyable read."
3,"[Similarities: Dokken, Pretty Maids, Emerald Rain]","This is your ""basic, nothing new but sounds good"" MR disc that neither bores nor gets you all that excited either. With the standout guitar work of Tommy Denander and the vocal double threat of Piere Wensberg and Geir Ronning driving the set, the ten songs put forth are decently written and executed but not terribly memorable. This is the kind of disc that when it's good, it's REAL good (like on the catchy ""Don't Wanna Waste Another Minute"" or ""Give My Heart A Home""). But otherwise it's just neither here nor there. Songs like ""Starry Eyes"" or ""Stop Playing Games"" remind of those filler songs that clogged up so many hard rock releases of the past and go through me like bad Mexican food. I've heard better...I've heard worse...sorry if I can't find more to say."
2,mixed review,"I recently read this book, and I can't honestly say that I liked it. I too have been diagnosed with MS. I'm happy that Mr. Lander can find humor in his condition, however I find nothing he had to say not in the least bit funny.MS is a terrible diease that affects the Central Nervous System and there's nothing funny about that. Even the title of the book is seriously upsetting(How Squiggy caught Multiple Sclerosis and Didn't Tell Nobody). You can't catch MS, and to put that in print is misleading.I take my MS, the treatment for it, and all the symptoms very seriously. I have no desire to joke about them.Some of the information in his book were very informative and very much worth reading, however I believe his approach is less than ideal."
4,not just for MS'ers!,"I did not read the book. I listened to an audio tape of it from the Library of Congress. The book was so interesting that I listened to it a second time. (I went blind in one eye in 1998 and went legally blind in my other eye in 2003. I have a good bit of residual vision in one eye.) Like David who was sometimes thought to be drunk, I can be taken for drunk, too (one reason I use my cane). Telling the truth makes things so much easier, as he learned. (I tried awhile to not let on that I had vision problems even when I bumped into something.) There is nothing to be ashamed of! My favorite line in the book has to do with people asking how he is. He can tell that what they mean is how much longer he will be able to walk. He wants to reply, ""The way you asked the question, I don't think I can live DOWN to your expectation."" Way to go! I love it!"
5,First of many purchases to come,This transaction was my first ever online. I was nervous about getting my textbooks on time (and getting a bargain). I recieved a brand new copy within 6 days of placing my order. The book is in fabulous condition and I got it for next to nothing! I am very pleased with this vendor and look forward to doing business with them in the future.
3,"Good information, but lacking in presentation","What Is a Rainbow? presents all the information needed for a child to understand what causes a rainbow in the sky. The information is presented in a straight-forward, easy to understand manner. For that, I give it a 5. But the dialogue between the animals is presented in cartoon type bubbles, and in a plain font. It is like a cheesy, B-rated comic and distracts from the winsome characters and information presented in the story. For that, I give it a 1. It is too bad that such details were overlooked in the publishing of this book, it had the potential to be a great children's book."
5,Cutest little bat ever!,My 10 month old son wore this bat costume on Halloween this year and was so super cute. The shoes were to small and keep falling off his feet but the cape alone was enough to make everyone say Awwwwww. The costume dose not come with the purple onesie so make sure you have something cute to go under the cape.
4,Worth it for the cuteness,"The cloak did fit my large (12lbs+) 2-month old, so the sizing on this, which I wasn't sure of, is accurate for a large infant; seems to me it would barely fit a 12-month-old unless that child was really pretty small, though the booties/gloves *would* fit, as they are very large and didn't fit my baby. It should be noted that the cloak is made of very cheap felt, but for the $13 I paid, it was totally worth it for the photo opp since I would never have bothered to make something like this myself. Also, the ears do stick up on their own, which is nice."
4,Loved baby bat!,This costume was a huge hit! Made of good quality and a good fit. My daughter is 8 months wearing 12 month clothes and this costume fit great! The main part is just a velcro cap that connects under neck with a hood attached so its great for many sizes.
5,Fantastic!,I bought this for my one year old daughter to wear for Halloween and it is a wonderful costume! We received tons of compliments while we were out trick or treating on how cute it was. Very practical for very active little ones. She ran around in it all night and flapped her wings without it getting in her way. Very well made. The fur around the feet doesn't fall off all over everywhere and the velcor to keep the cape on actually holds really well. Perfect costume! We even kept it after Halloween for her to play dress up in!
5,Very very cute!,"Our baby got lots of compliments last halloween! It is soft, good quality, very cute. Shoes part was useful for cold weather, but gloves kept falling off, and at the end we lost one.."
4,Great Costume.,This was a super cute costume. The only complaint I had was one of his boots kept falling off. It was made a lot more loose than the other one. Still it was super cute.
1,bad product,This was the worst test product ever. I had no results except for weight loss. I did not gain any strength at all. This is the worst testosterone booster out there. I have been lifting weights for 11 years 6 days a week and during that time I have not missed more than one week per year of lifting. The one week is for vacation trips. Take it from a very dedicated weightlifter this is a waist of money. Animal Test is the best out there right now.
1,Doesn't work for me,"I dont know guys, but everybody is different... in my particular case I didn't have any positive result, haven't experience any gain in muscle or weight lifted even if I train really hard, as I always do.The big bump was that it gave me a lot of acne, specially in my back!!!As I said before... It does't gave me any possitive result, but, it is my particular case.BL... I wouldn't recommend it unless you don't mind about the awfull acne"
1,Not Good,I do not recommend this product. If you really want to get big use Creatine and Protein. Did nothing for me. I had to go to the bathroom every five minutes. You have to take five of these puppies with a lot of water. Good if you want to clean you urinary system.
2,Not what it's cracked up to be.,Well I tried T-Bomb from MHP to see if it was better then Gaspari but I think I made a mistake with this one I don't really feel anything like I did with Gaspari. Sorry MHP but Gaspari's ahead with this supplement.
3,i had to come back and edit my review.....,"ok this stuff works, but i came to my senses and stopped taking them because i don't like messing with my chemistry THAT much, i just stick to tribulus, amino acids, and a weight gainer after work outs....this stuff DID cut down the recovery time, but it messes with your estrogen and testosterone so much, when i stopped taking everything i didn't feel too different, it's been about 5 days now, and i still feel the same.....it's expensive if you calculate it, you'll go through so many bottles a year you'll end up spending $1,000 in no time, especially if you take MORE than the recommended amount which i've seen people say they do in some of their reviews like on gnc.com....becareful ;) you're not young forever.....(i'm 24)"
1,T-BOMBED.......Better results taking MnMs,"Has anybody mention the nasty taste?Maybe it's just me,but I tried all 168 tabs of this product.I lost strength,lean muscle mass,and felt lethargic.To take 6 pills a day of this product,(they tastelike crap),and you get worse results than a placebo???Nah.There are much better products outthere."
1,Not a great product,"Despite all the hype, the product is not what I would have expected. First off, when you open it, it smells FOUL. How does anyone swallow 3 in the morning and 3 at night ?!?!? I tryed it got diarrhea right away. I repeated a few days later and the same thing happened. I would love to return it but unable to reach someone."
1,no-sleep,"the very first day i used this product i took the recommended dosage in the morning before my work out. later that afternoon i felt real good--an energy rush--and i started working on my kata moves--punchin and kickin and whatever--a real burst of energy and positive emotion. however, i did not sleep that night. i continued to take this stuff for about two weeks--but i felt real odd, and i did not sleep well at all--little to none. eventually i discontinued it--and my sleep slowly recovered. i would not recomend it."
5,Powerful!!!!!!!!,"This is by far the best muscule producing product i've ever used, i've packed on 50 plus pounds of rock hard muscle!! It really works!!!"
5,One of the best supplements on the market,"I'm a woman so I don't take testosterone. I didn't want to grow a beard... or worse. :) But, I digress.My boyfriend and his father both use T-Bomb and according to them:- unlike most testosterone supplements, it does not cause acne breakouts- it definitely adds more oomph to their almost daily gym workout- and it improves libidoThey have ordered T-Bomb twice thus far and no ill side effects have been noted."
2,Not much effect,I took three bottles worth and saw a small but insignificant effect. I don't plan to buy any more at this time.
4,Learn to Speak French 8.01,"It was easy to install but I could not run it until I called the support. I did not have the problems that I read others have had with talking to them. The girl I spoke with was very helpful, and walked me through editing the registry. The program is now running. I have not had too much time to use it, but what I have seen and used so far is great. This is a very easy to use program. They just need to get this error resolved so people don't have to call or visit thier web site to get it fixed."
1,Didn't work,"..sent me version 8.01. It wouldn't run on my machine with Windows Me. I called their tech support and was told to send it back to the company and ask for version 8.0. I did that and received a check for the purchase price... So what I got was the frustration and aggravation of a program that won't work, and I am out the shipping charges both ways."
1,Good luck trying to install this package,After 20+ tries to install it I gave up. Not only could I not get this to install but I couldn't even uninstall it. The website was no help at all. This was on Windows 98.
2,WARNING WINDOWS ME USERS,Don't buy this software if you run Windows ME. The version they are currently shipping is 8.01 -- this version will not work on Windows Me and The Learning Company's technical support has no way to fix it yet. Be careful because the box is labeled version 8.0 but the actual CDs are labeled 8.01. I wish it did run because it looks like a great program I reccomend it to those with compatible computers.
1,Terrible Technical Support,"As everyone else has noted, this program does not actually work, which makes it difficult to learn French. The only reason I am adding to the list of negative reviews is to follow through on a promise to The Learning Company's technical support department. Not only did they fail to get the program running, it took them over two weeks of correspondence to reach the conclusion that my problem was purchasing the non-functional version 8.0.1, despite the fact that I noted the version number in my original complaint. Every person I interacted with was lacking in both technical knowledge and basic customer support skills. Do not purchase this program, and I would avoid other Learning Company products as well."
1,Save your receipt and packaging,"I have not been able to install this software. The software is advertised as being compatible with Windows ME, but I have serious doubts that it is. I consulted The Learning Company website and followed instructions that included downloading and installing a patch for Windows ME and changing the MSCONFIG file to disable all programs that load at start-up. The program still would not run. I submitted a request for assistance, gave them all the information about my operating system, memory, drivers etc. I received advice, followed the advice, and the program still will not run. I received a second set of instructions, but they also had no effect. Throughout the process I always received the same error message. I'm sorry I didn't pay more attention to the other negative reviews--returning the product is a hassle. I would note that I have never had difficulty with or returned software before."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"Be careful buying this product - it is incompatible with most newer computers, and the mnaufacturer, The Learning Company no longer really exists - The Learning Company was purchased by Mattel, who offers no support for it. The TECHNICAL SUPPORT phone #319-247-3333 provided with the product is disconnected and the CUSTOMER SERVICE phone #617-761-3000 delivers a continuous busy signal 24 hours/day 7 days/week. - so again, BUYEER BEWARE!!!"
1,Useless piece of software,"I did not manage to get Learn to Speak French 8.0 running on my computer. Contacting the technical support staff at The Learning Company was not helpful - the only advice they could give me was to return my software and ask for a refund... I took me about 6 hours of installation and re-installation, including a new, clean installation of Win98 - no way to get that stuff workig - annoying, useless piece of software"
1,"Never worked, tech support agrees","I was really looking forward to this software after all the glowing reviews. Unfortunately, I could never get it to install and run correctly. I tried 5 PCs, 3 operating systems, and all the generous support the publisher provided. I'm a Microsoft professional, so it wasn't a dumb user to blame. Tech support said they had known issues with version 8.0 and said I should send for a refund. I hope they get it corrected."
2,Learn to Speak French 7.0 and 8.0,"This is a great product, but watch out! It only works with Win 95 and 98, not with Win 2000. I called Mattel's helpline twice and both times they said that they don't offer a patch anytime soon. If you have Win2000, it cannot be installed at all!"
1,Will not run,Installed and reinstalled programs in an attempt to get it run. Failed to work properly created error messages. Tried on two computers with same results. Very dissappointing!
1,Doesn't work with Windows NT or 2000!,"purchased this to spruce up my pronunciation but found that this version doesn't work with Windows 2000; however, I've now ordered version 8.1 which, supposedly, does work on my platform and will write another review after I've received and tried it."
2,evaluation of new software,"Iam new customer, i am very interested to have this software entiltled "" Learn to Speak French"". For me to evaluate and/or review this product I would like to ship me a demo CD om my follwing address:Tripoli, LibyaWaha Oil company-Planning DepartmentPo.box395Ali.H.Alsudany"
4,SOUNDS GOOD,"I heard some of this cd. It sounds good, but i would get there newer stuff first, then get this cd."
5,Very Convenient,"It is wonderful to have an entire weight system that fits into two large shoeboxes. These are easiest to use if you have a hard, level surface that is about thigh-height to place them on - it makes putting the weight down, changing the level, then picking it up again (in seconds - you are just moving a bar from one set of holes to another) a breeze. My trainer carries her set from client to client because they are so compact and ""lightweight"" compared to carrying around an array of dumbbells. The only very picky complaint I have is that it is easy to bang up your wrist if you lift the weight too quickly or with too much weight on it because of the way the structure balances with your hand inside it. (And this complaint is awfully picky - you should be very careful lifting _any_ kind of hand weight!)"
2,ok,"I'll keep it simple. I'm a huge fan of Mica Paris. I do not think this is a good indicator of her talent and selection of material. Because I'm a fan, I have it for my collection. However,after giving this several listens, I find very little to be excited about here. Can't win them all!! I love everything else in her catalogue, though! Thanks!"
5,A touch of humor and wisdom at the same time,"I have personally had an opportunity to hear Dr. Peebles thru earlier sources like Wm Rainen and Thomas Jacobson. I have also carefully observed Summer Bacon on Youtube and anyone who makes such a comparison cannot help but notice the striking similarity.This book is filled with one or two page snippets she has collected over the years, a gold mine of tidbits for Dr. Peebles fans.Dr Peebles is in it for the long haul, about 35 years by my calendar. His gentle humor mixed with spiritual wisdom is a soft sell of compassionate ideas that will soak into your heart."
4,Turning on the light,Great book by a great author. Delivery was not all that fast but it came int he alloted time. The book wa in the advertised condition. I would purchase from these folks again
5,best tools,"When you buy tools, buy the best and you will never be disappointed. Klein is the best in small hand tools. Shipped promptly."
3,2 short Phillips Tip Screwdriver instead of 1 short Keystone Tip Screwdriver & 1 short Phillips Tip Screwdriver,"Excellent set of Klein Screwdrivers, but as different in pictures it does not Includes 1 short Keystone Tip Screwdriver, its came with 2 short Phillips Tip Screwdriver"
5,Great,"Klien has always been good tools,a litte pricey but last.some one stole my tools out of my truck,did not want to spend a ton at the big box stores,so amazon to the rescue."
5,Great Disc!,This is not only one of the best ska/rocksteady CD's I've ever heard but It's also one of my favorites CD's of all time. I highly recommend you check it out.
5,A treasure of a cookbook,"I bought Maverick Sea Fare in 1980 while sailing in the British Virgin Islands. Not only does it have great recipes, but great illustrations and commentary. Just looking through the book always takes me back to the Islands. Among favorite recipes are the Maverick French Toast and Stuffed Christophenes. We often use the current edition, smaller and softcover, for gifts for our sailing friends."
4,Nice phone at a real big price,"The phone is nice but the price, i feel , is excessive. By the time you get the phone home the price is just over $200. If you want all your settings and recorded message to remain when the unit is unplugged or electric goes out there is an optional $15 battery and $6 shipping to buy. Now we are up to a cheap computer price....whew"
1,Worst Phone I've Owned - Update,"I have the base with two satellite units. I have experience numerous dropped calls and low battery problems. Granted, the system is one of the most attractive in the market place. But, the level of frustration experienced by dropped call has convinced me that I should just buy a new phone from another company.I changed the OME batteries and I have not experienced the above problems."
2,"Looks nice, that's about it","I purchased this unit as well as a satellite base. This phone works great about 20 feet from the base, then quality goes to pot. My second unit quit working completely. I ignored the bad reviews on this- really wish I handn't. This thing stinks."
1,The Worst Phone in The History of The Universe?,"Terrible. Horrible . Where do I start? The bad sound quality, the slowness of the dialing (you have to dial the number first then press go, like a cellphone. Otherwise you have to wait 1.5 seconds for the dialtone. If you dont, redial).Other problems - phone looses base for no reason. Some messages are very quiet, almost impossible to hear. Resets day of the week for no reason. Lots of messages where the person has hung up, and you hear the recorded message saying ""if you would like to make a call.. This phone looks good but really s BAD."
1,What a lemon,I bought this phone one year ago. I have had nothing but problems. I wasted a lot of money for this phone and an extra side line. (It keeps dropping a connection) The Master phone isnt working now either.Buyer Beware!
2,great phone for 1 year BUT,"We LOVED this phone with all the feature it has. You can record your own ring which was need so the kids would hear the name of the person calling.Just before the warrenty was up the phone would drop calls. The display shows ""searching for base"" (even right next to it). We called customer service and were told (after resetting etc) to send in the handset unit. They send a new refurnished one back. After a little while the same Propblem. We called Vtech again this time they told us must have been the base unit but unfortuentelly we now out of warranty. After back and force they send us a refunsihed new base about 2 weeks ago. Same Problem calls getting dropped all the time. I can't even pick up the phone a lot of times. YES, we did change the locating of the phone.Of course I called them again and well we already out of warrenty even so each new set came with a warrenty label to keep.Sad we realy liked the phone while it was working!"
3,Great when it works,I have had this phone 2 years and although is great when it works I have had to have it replaced 2 times. Vtech was very helpful and replaced the phone for free under waranty it has still been a hassle. The picture is better than I thought it would be and is very easy to set up and use.
1,This Phone Is GARBAGE!!!!!,"This Phone is the worst I have ever owned! The handset is constantly searching for the base, which makes using it almost impossible. The handset constantly says Low Battery, even though it is always on the cradle. When I was able to use it (occasionally), the sound through the handset is very poor. I'm going back to Uniden!!This thing is going back TODAY!!"
1,Don't buy this phone,"After ten months (right outside the warranty period) this entire system began malfunctioning. None of the seven handsets I purchased worked; all read ""searching for station."" The base station even began malfunctioning. For two weeks we had no phones. Not to mention the dropped calls in the middle of client conferences or simply going dead while on an overseas call with a friend.I tried to get VTech to help. I got "" your phone is out of warranty"".Do not buy this phone or anything else from this company. I am so sick of crummy products with worse service. This product deserves a class action suit."
1,this phone system is a joke,"We purchased this phone about 18 months ago along with two matching additional phones to put in basement and bedroom. The basement phone started acting up about eight months ago and no longer holds a charge at all. Now the other two are not working right. They constantly say ""searching for base"" when you try and answer them and we lose calls all the time. We need to replace all three phones and they were not cheap. We are very disappointed and will never purchase vtech phones again. We've never had cordless phones fail after this short of a time and these are the most expensive ones we've ever purchased."
3,Still questioning this phone,We've had this phone for about three weeks and it has a lot of really nice cool features (like the downloadable phone book) but it keeps loosing touch with it's handsets which is really frustrating. We're working on this problem by moving the phones and base around the house but it's not fun. Hopefully we'll figure out our problem.
2,Slow and Ineffecient,"I hate this phone. I bought it for its looks but frequently want to throw it accross the room. It is slow - frequently does not take all the numbers you enter unless you press them slowly. I would say that out of every 5 numbers I dial, i have to dial one again. The date resets if it looses power for one second - no backup battery or capacitance to hold a charge. Phonebook sucks. Speakerphone sucks. I hate this phone."
4,"Beautiful to look at, easy to use","The VTECH i5871 is beautiful. Range is somewhat shorter than I had hoped it would be, but my home has an odd layout. No problems of any kind. Sounds good, answering machine works well. More features than I'll probably ever use. I recommend it highly if you are looking for a wireless phone/answering machine."
1,no good,I've had nearly all the problems you can read about in the other 1-star reviews with my Vtech i5871 which I purchsed about 2 years ago. It's now just an expensive paper weight. It's too bad because it seemed like a very cool phone with plenty of features but the MAIN FEATURE IT'S MISSING IS RELIABILTY. No more Vtech for me.
5,Excellent system...Must have....Good Visuals,"I absolutely love this phone. Great reception, Great visuals. Easy to use. Simple design. This was important, as I hate clutter on phones. This has few buttons with great features.Two Cons: The minor con: Have to program each handset individually, but I don't really care ... I would still purchase this phone. The Major Con: It is not yet MAC compatible. Only Windows. I can get around that with my windows laptop for work, but hopefully Vtech will correct this oversight in the future.Overall, very happy with these phones and highly recommend them."
1,Doesn't work!,"I have this unit since October 2005 and the answering machine doesn't work properly. It records only the first call and then stops working. If I want ot use it again, I have to unplug the unit and then be able to record just one call. I have exchanged this phone twice and have been in contact with V-Tech technical area but they have been unable to provide an answer to this problem I will send it back and buy something else! The style is great though but too expensive just for looks, I had to buy a separate answering machine to be able to take messages. Bad luck I guess."
4,Love it but needs mac support,"I love it, I just wish I could edit the address book with my Mac. Hopefully they will build a Mac client, if not I guess I can use my wife's new macBook which I installed windows crapola XP on it."
3,It is Ok,I thought it was going to be much better that what it is. It is a regular phone without any adventage.
3,802.11a compatability?,"I called V-Tech customer service to see if this phone is compatable with 802.11a wireless, and they could not give me an answer."
3,Searching For Base,"I bought this phone primarily for it's styling, which is great. Unfortunately, it is now suffering the ""Searching for base"" problem described by many others after a year of use. I had the same problem with a previous Vtech phone system, so I won't be buying this brand again."
1,"Worst Phone, Ever","Cordless / wireless phone technology has been around a while so it should almost be perfected by now, right? Well, if you have this phone ... Wrong!!! It's by far the worst phone I've ever owned. Looks are only skin deep and will never buy another Vtech product again. It constantly loses connection with the base (18 inches away) and then it will never reconnect and just stays in searching mode. Also, the battery can't hold a charge for more than an hour or two off the stand now. Avoid at all possible costs."
1,Worst phone I've ever owned!,"I've owned this phone for over a year now, and it is hands down the worst phone I've ever owned!In the first few months itself the phone kept resetting, so I sent it in to Vtech (under warranty). They replaced it and the replacement seemed to work for a few more months.Now I am getting the same problem again, and the calls keep dropping, since the handset cannot maintain connection with the base unit.Stay away from this phone! I'll never buy a Vtech again."
1,Worked OK first 4 months - horrible now,"Bought it 2 years ago. In the beginning (about 4 months)it was OK. Now the units consistenly ""lose base"" after 2 - 3 min of conversation.I had countless calls to tech support, did everything they recommended - no results.Currently I am using a regular phone, occasionally I have tried to revive the VTech, but without success."
1,Great looking. Terrible performance.,"I thought I'd take a moment to echo most other reviews shown here. I purchased this phone immediately after it came to market, along with one expansion handset. The speaker failed in one of the handsets after about a year of ownership. Any call longer than 10 minutes is bound to end in an ""Out of Range"" error. The color LCDs used are among the absolute worst you'll find on the market. Phone software is very poorly designed, a step above unusable.These phones look great, unfortunately that's where the praise ends."
2,Searching for base problem after 18 month of use,"Same as the other reviews- Searching for base and dropped call issues show up after a year and on half of trouble free use. A shame, nice looking product and it works pretty good at first."
4,Nice Phone,It's the battery. The one that comes with the phone is cow dung!Go to Radio Shack and buy a replacement. I guarantee that yourphone will work properly.
2,DO NOT BUY!,I ORDERED THIS EXPANDABLE SYSTEM WITH 3 ADDITIONAL HANDSETS. WHEN I GOT THEM 2 OF THEM DID NOT WORK AT ALL. THE SELLER QUICKLY SHIPPED OUT 2 MORE BUT THOSE DID NOT WORK EITHER. I ORDERED NEW BATTERIES AND STILL NOTHING! VTECH DOES NOT EVEN SELL THESE ANYMORE. I WASTED MY MONEY.
1,junk,"do not even think of buying this item...it is just simply JUNK...!!!never worked properly, and after only 4 months the whole thing just stopped working!"
1,Miserable phone,"Of two handsets and one base, only the base works anymore, and then only partially. The handsets are forever ""searching"" for the base. Nothing satisfies them. I finally unplugged them and put them in a closet. That left me with the base unit. Sometimes calls come in. Sometimes I pick up the receiver and the call has been dropped. The answering system doesn't work. I recorded a message. It played back fine. Then because I'd learned to be suspicious of this phone, I called in from a different number and golly gee, what a surprise, the recording function doesn't work. In fact, the phone couldn't get beyond the first two words of my message before failing. It didn't even get as far as the beep to even think about recording.Why this is such a whiz bang phone is beyond me. I no longer give out the number to which it is attached, it is that unreliable. vTech should be ashamed of marketing such a terrible product. Smoke signals and carrier pigeons are more effective."
1,Save yourself! Don't buy it!,I've had nearly all the problems you can read about in the other 1-star reviews with my Vtech i5871 which I purchsed about 2 years ago. It's now just an expensive paper weight. It's too bad because it seemed like a very cool phone with plenty of features but the MAIN FEATURE IT'S MISSING IS RELIABILTY. No more Vtech for me.
5,Phone w/Lots of Potential,I enjoyed this phone. You can add photos and all that. I mean really nice. Songs...its just like a cell phone....so its a plus for me...stylish!
1,Run away,"I love VTech. This phone system...not so much. It worked well for a year. Then phones started dropping calls. Now it is almost unusable. It is not an interference. It is the phone system. It started with the remote phones (i5808) and moved into the main system.Additionally, items like the phone book and intercom take too many keystrokes to access. Battery life was also disappointing.On the plus side: Good distance. Clear calls...for one year.Pick another phone"
3,"Looks/sounds great, but not as easy as I expected","What everyone else has written about the style and sound are right. But I bought this (expensive) phone because I thought that when vTech WROTE ON THEIR WEBSITE ""Share phonebook directories between handsets"" they meant it. But they DON'T. Each one has to be plugged into the PC individually. Yuck. It would be SO much better to ""push"" the addresses from the base to the headsets. Also, their software (requiring a comma-delimited file that can't recognize Personal AND Business numbers, can't handle very many letters and sorts by FIRST name) is really weak. Not being able to delete all logs from all handsets simultaneously is a drag for an OCD person like me.I have buyers remorse with all the money I spent on them, but they are still beautiful and powerful. Comma-delimited or not, using my Outlook address book IS better than not."
3,Very basic tumbler,"If you're using this as a cup, it will work fine. But it is a very basic tumbler. I wanted to use this as a toothbrush holder, but it is such a lightweight plastic that it tips over when i put the toothbruses/toothpaste in there. Wish it was a little heavier."
3,Too Many Misses,"I own two of Rick Rodgers 101 books and have been pleased. I was disappointed in this one however because I am not a cook who uses alcohol in cooking or beverages and that eliminated many of Rick's holiday offerings. It would have been nice to have some non-alcoholic substitutions suggested. I felt that, for me, this book was not worth the price."
3,Christmas *Recipes* 101 would be a better book title,"I am disappointed in this book because it is *not* a general book about Christmas preparation, but a recipe book only. With a name like Christmas 101, and what I read in the book description, I was expecting not only recipes but perhaps an overall Christmas timetable, tips on selecting a tree as well as thoughts on natural vs artificial, information on different cultures' traditions other than strictly food based. This is a nice enough recipe book, but is is now what I expected, or wanted."
3,More than just a housekeeper,Mrs. Hudson was just not a landlady and housekeeper for Sherlock Holmes; she was an amateur sleuth in her own right. She and her disapproving friend solve a crime of their own.
5,Corelle,"Have always loved Corelle....will always love Corelle. It is inexpensive, lightweight, can be used in the microwave and is fairly break-resistant. What's not to love????"
3,Right Product/HORRIBLE Wrapping,"Again, product was well padded, but the gift wrapping wasn't taped, and was bunched up. It was obviously slapped together, I'll wrap by own stuff from now on."
5,essental bowls,The bowls are perfect size for serving and mixing. They are light weight and durable. The basic white color goes with any set. It's a great price and you get free shipping from Amazon too!
4,Needed additions,I was hoping for three different sizes but 2 of the bowls were the same size. I wasn't sorry I bought and use them all the time. I use the larger to serve pasta and the others for vegetables.
5,Great bowls.,"Great bowls, a little larger than I imagined which is good. There are some flaws in the bowls itself but not hinder the use though. I just love Corelle."
5,Nice!,Durable and light weight. The winter white will never look outdated. Will look nice with any color. You'll never worry about holiday or other special table decorations clashing with your dishes.
5,Very pleased,I was so impressed with the 3 bowls. They match any serving plates.I didn't know the large one would be so big. I was really surprised and happy because it can hold a lot of mashed potatoes for a crowd. I would highly recommend Corelle service set to others.
3,It's ok,"Unfortunately this cd has no suprises, it's alittle too predictable. I listened to it serveral times encouraging it to grab me but, I gave up.The only one I do listen to is 'So many times' many times-for that church vibe. Though, it will not stop me from buying Dorinda's next cd."
5,Beautiful Rose!!!!!!!!!,"First off this woman is so beautiful. She physically embodies the true meaning of what a rose is. The band on this project is worth the money alone, not to mention dorinda's jazzy vocals over smooth and polished background vocalists. Every song is wonderfully arranged, and so annointed. I love every aspect of this project from the singing,preaching, and can't forget that awesome music. I often times find myself repeating the songs for my listening plesure. Go Alex ""Asaph"" Ward you did it again. My favorite picks from this album are ALL OF THEM!!!!!. If you love great music that is sprit-filled and singing that will make you simply say ""WOW"", then this is definitely one to add to your collection. Trust me when I say that this project has blossomed beautifully!!!!!!!. PHENOMENAL!!!!!"
5,GREAT IS THE LORD,"I love this album it really ministers to me personally and I would recommend it to everybody young and old. My favorites are Great is the Lord, Everything he promised, Say yes, and Work to do. This album is GREAT GREAT GREAT"
3,"Love Dorinda, but not this CD :-)","I was disappointed with this release although I love Dorinda Clark-Cole and the other Clark Sisters. Just something amiss with this entire CD. Not sure if it was writing/lyrics, or some of the music arrangements. I liked only one song on the entire CD, which is unheard of for me with a Clark Sisters CD. However, I'm a die-hard Clark Sisters fan, so I'm still going to buy Dorinda's next one. If you are a Clark Sisters fan, maybe you can relate, but I keep waiting for a CD release from any of the Clark Sisters that would rival the perfection of Karen's ""Finally"" CD years back."
3,"Slater is excellent, as usual.","Helen Slater has always been one of my favorite actress and I must admit she was the reason I bought this movie. As usual, she didn't disappoint me, playing an amazingly convincing blind woman. She also writes and sings ""detour"", the main song of the movie: excellent! How come she never released an album?As for the movie itself... Well, it's not a bad story; but there's nothing really unpredictable in it and the two bad guys are way too caricatural.The DVD edition has no feature at all, not even a chapter menu."
5,Absolutely the best!,"I subscribed to Mountain Bike Action and then decided I would try Mountain Biking for a while. BIG MISTAKE! MBA is a far better magazine! The bike reviews are more thorough and the articles by Richard Cunningham are very informative. I have been involved in Mountain Biking for over twenty years and since its inception, this magazine has been the standard! (""Dirt Rag"" is good, too!)"
2,"Great magazine, but buy it directly, not worth it through here!","Anyone who likes mountain bike will see this magazine has great reviews and interesting articles, plus tons of advertisement, whether you like them or not.I have no complaints about the magazine, I knew it before hand, but really, buying it here, to save almost nothing has been deceiving.I made the purchase on feb 8, and as of mar 28 (today) I haven't received the first issue yet. I called the magazine customer service number, great gal, by the way, and she told me it should be anytime.Hope you find this review helpful. Have fun riding"
3,Is this the same magizine?,"I don't know if it's the same magazine but Sheldon Brown-bike guru, wrote an article about a magazine of the same. (...) I pass no judgement but you may be interested."
1,Where's my F_n magazines!?,Its been 12 weeks and still no magazines!!! No reply email whatsover!! Amazon need to rid this vendor ASAP and give me a refund!! NEVER USING AMAZON'S MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE AGAIN!!! THIS IS ALSO HAPPENING TO MY POPULAR SCIENCE SUBSCRIPTION!!....I'm offically out of breath.
1,Poor editorial,"Honestly this is the worst written mountain bike magazine, and even the pictures are very sub-par. I do not recommend it..."
2,Different Measuring System,"I was disappointed to find that since the author is from the United Kingdom that measurements are in the metric system instead of the household system. Also, I discovered that there is a new reprint of this book with the same recipes titled, ""Fresh and Fast Vegan"" where the measuring system has been revised. I would save my money and buy the other edition instead."
4,different,"i bought this on the recommedation of other's reviews and i'm glad i did. i was pleasantly surprised. this was not your typical mob movie and i want to thank those people who recommended it. i only knew a couple of actors in this movie which was the father,the main thug and nicky who was killed from the series csi ny. i only knew them by face because they always have small roles. i had kind of pulled away from watching films about the mob because they had become typical and predictable but this one was refreshing. what can i say accept i loved it."
4,Hey Mikey. He friggin Likes It!,"I don't write spoilers. This is a nice, little story. It's a bit low budget. That's OK, though. It's nice to see people working w/less. Yeah, there's a couple of flaws w/the storyline, but it's an enjoyable shortish film. This kid has been studying Leo D'Caprio's face pix a bit too much :-P... D'Onfrio has got to be related to the guy who played Animal Mother in FMJ. I don't care what their stage names are. Good film @a good price. You'll probably like it, too. Caio."
1,Dow 60000 by 2010!!!!! WOW!!!! ;-),"Said Morningstar about the author's fund in 2004 (""The Best- and Worst-Performing Funds of 2004""):""Grand Prix GPFFXThis fund's wacky trajectory has enabled more than a few fund analysts to unleash car-themed jokes. Only ""crash test dummies"" would want this ""out of control"" ""lemon,"" we opined over the space of three Analyst Reports. This year's 36% loss to date is just a taste of losses that have hit this fund's shareholders. It's one of the most volatile funds in our database, yet investors haven't been rewarded for sticking with it. It has lost an annualized 22% over the past five years. And it charges 2.49% in expenses to boot.""And the author wants me to buy his book??I'll stick with boring, conventional wisdom (Bogle, Graham, Malkiel) and index funds, thanks."
