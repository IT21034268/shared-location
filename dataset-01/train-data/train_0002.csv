4,"Like the price, but connection isn't secure enough","Was an affordable alternative to Apple's and generally works well, but the connector to the computer isn't secure. I'll be typing along and get a battery warning and have to jiggle the cord to recharge. Still, came at a better price than Apple's and I got what I paid for."
4,Great Deal!,so much more inexpensive than the apple adapter. takes a little longer to get to 100% but not significantly longer. easier to plug in anywhere vs. the apple adapter. significant differences in design and there is nothing on the adapter to indicate if its charging or if charging is complete.otherwise great buy!
4,Thank God!,"I love Macs and have had them for years, but I get really irritated having to replace the low-grade peripherals all the time, especially power supplies. The Macally version is great. Smaller, lighter and longer than the Apple version, and half the cost. Works just fine. I've used macally stuff before and it's always very solid and well thought out, definitely fills a void."
2,Shock Treatment,"An AC/DC power converter is a very basic item, so I had little doubt that this sub for the expensive Apple original would be effective, though not stylish. Unfortunately, we have had problems. The Powerbook started delivering electrical shocks and inconsistent charging with this adapter, and they got worse when we moved to a country on 240V. I know that the shock problem comes from the Macally adapter because I have another PB and an original Apple power supply, so can do all combinatorial tests. I like Macally and have several of their other products. I probably just got a bum unit but unfortunately cannot deliver a positive review based on previous experience with the company."
2,Good for a few months,"The adapter worked fine for my power book g4 for a few months and then it broke. Nothing physically happened to the adapter for it to break, but suddenly it just wouldn't charge any more. What's interesting is that the blue light on the brick goes on when plugged in to a power source, but if I plug the cable that attaches the computer to the brick in, the light goes out and it doesn't charge."
1,Bate and Switch,"We ordered the Macally PS-AC4 power adapter and received an entirely different product from a differnt comany. As noted by other Amazon shoppers we received th Inspire M8482. This adapter is differnet in the following ways..instead of the 10'cord with a velcro wrapper, it has a short cord that leavesthe transformer hanging from the input of your computer. This will ultimately break the DC connection from the board..this is not repairable. Their is no led power light as advertised leaving you wondering if it is on. It is clearly a cheap knck off and we are taken for idiots who might not recognize that. I am mad! I just went through a similar thing with Overstock. Months of emails, calls and waiting on hold...for a grain of satisfaction. It is insulting to think that these big companies have so little respect for us!"
3,"Cheaply made charger get the job done, but for how long...","I wouldn't suggest this charger unless you are selling your laptop to someone and just need it to prove the computer works. The quality of construction, most notably where the cord that connect to the computer attaches to the power brick, is awful. Spend a little more and get something better if you can."
2,Doesn't hold up to my backpack,"I bought this adapter almost two years ago and it still works-kind of. The insulation on the area of the cable where it enters the brick has become damaged, exposing the outer wire. I taped it up, but there is always a connection issue, where the AC indicator at the top of the screen will often flash to battery power and then back to AC. I keep the AC adaptor in the front compartment of my backpack, so it sees some but not major abuse. I'm sure this won't be an issue if you aren't traveling with it, but I just thought I would relate my experience."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I was worried when I ordered this because there were so many bad reviews. After all, it's a power cord there is only one thing that can go wrong how can they all be so bad. I have had it for about a month now and it's a power cord. yay!"
2,Cheap quality and non-existant service,After using the charger for about 2 weeks I started noticing drops in the power feeding to the iBook. After about 2 months the charger stopped working altogether. On inspection I noticed that the metal part of the plug was separating from the plastic part and I suspect this is causing the disconnect. MacAlly has no warranty information on their web site and I called them several times only to be diverted to a messaging system and I never got a callback.I'd say avoid if you can.
5,Very Good,"I read many positive reviews before buying this product, so my thanks to all of the previous posters. This adaptor is actually really great. I was a little upset before because I thought I was replacing my old G3 adapter with an even uglier one but was very happy to see that it isn't like the picture. It's the same shape but the chords everything is white, so it matches well with my ibook. It also has a pretty blue light that shines when the AC is connected, but it doesn't do much else. So if your worried about having an ugly adapter don't be because this is actually pretty nice. (at least much nicer than the G3 model adaper)"
1,They are selling defective merchandise -- look at recent reviews!,"I too have the same problem most recent reviewers have had: when I plug the charger in, it cycles between charging and not charging every two seconds. The computer doesn't end up charging.In addition, the version I have doesn't look like the picture on the Amazon web site, and doesn't have the power LED.Clearly there is an epidemic of defective chargers. And we, the customer, have to go to the hassle of obtaining a return authorization and sending it back.I notified the seller. I am also going to notify Amazon to research this topic, and take the product off the site until they can resolve the issue. Other than this charger, my experience with Amazon has been exemplary.I strongly suggest that if you too have bought one of these chargers and have had trouble with it, please post here."
1,Poorly made product,"The Macally PS-AC4 Power Adapter would not charge my PowerBook. I tested it with a multimeter, and found that it had an open lead.I contacted Amazon (even better, through their web site - no waiting on the phone or waiting for an email), and they shipped another.This second one had the same problem as the first.I contacted Amazon again for a refund.The product was junk, but the service was excellent!"
2,Mishap,"Unfortunately I shall not be able to review the Macally Power Adapter. I did not pay due attention to the fact that the AC adaptor works with G3 iBook and G4 PowerBook only.I plugged it in with a G4 iBook , it made some complaining noises and it died. Maybe it would be proper to really WARN that it will NOT work with a G4 iBook in CAPITAL LETTERS.$40.- down the drain!"
2,Off and on,Its hard to find these types of chargers since Mac switched to the magnetic type. Its hit and miss with the working. My battery indicator switches from charging to not in a blinking fashion.
4,cheaper and it gets the job done,"I wouldn't get this for a newer machine, but decent for an old beater laptop. Main complaint is that the powercord doesn't detach from the adapter (though a previous reviewer said it came as three parts) as I like to leave the powercord plugged. Though Apple no longer sells the yoyo, the cordwrap feature on the OEM was a nice feature. Unlike the picture my Macally has white cords, not gray, which is more aesthetically pleasing."
5,Great Solution!,"This Adapter will do the job as good or even better than the original adapter for a fraction of the price. Unless you are deeply in love with the ""cute looks"" and the Apple logo on the original adapter save your self some money by buying this one."
2,you'll be sorrry!,"After 4.5 months, the adapter died. I contacted Macally about the one year warranty and learned :1. the only way they will issue a refund is if the adapter causes a fire!2. I needed to send the adapter to the manufacturer in California for them to evaluate--I would be without a power cord for a week. They said the replacement adapter might be refurbished.Ultimately, I went to the Apple store and purchased a Mac power cord."
1,"Cheap, Doesn't charge, dangerous, power cord","This is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around. I own a 15"" Powerbook G4 (which this is listed as being compatible with).The problem is that this isn't actually a 65watt power cord... so don't expect to use your computer while it's charging... and don't expect to be able to touch the ""brick"" as it's plugged in, you'll burn yourself.I've returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a TON better."
1,Macally Power cord,Macally is a terrible company. NOT worth the money you save. I recently bought a power cord thru them that emits an electrical current thru my computer. They will only send me a replacement but won't give me my money back. Not worth the risk. Buy Mac!Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
2,When it worked it was great,"I had this charger for over two years. Last week while it was plugged into my computer, it just died. No blue light no current. I ended up splicing the connector to my old frayed Apple charger. The connector is much better than Apple's."
4,Better than Mac's charger,"Like some other reviewers, the product I received did not look exactly like the one pictured. That's irritating. But, it functions perfectly, which is more than I can say for the expensive Mac chargers.Mac stores will tell you it's a ""myth"" that their chargers break. Um... why is it then that me, my brother, three friends and several acquaintances have had this problem?"
3,"A good replacement, but...","I've had no problems with this charger so far. I purchased it as a replacement to the Apple charger, which stopped working due to the cord being so bent that it shorted out. My only complaint with the Macally charger, is that it takes much longer to bring the computer to a full charge than the Apple charger does."
1,Works great... for about a month,"Everything the other reviews say about this product is largely true: the cord is thicker and more durable than the Apple adapter, the brick doesn't get as unnervingly hot, you can deal with the fact that it's not powerful enough to be used as a power source... but one day it just mysteriously stops working. I bought this to replace my broken Apple adapter and was generally very pleased with it, but about a month later I went to plug it in one day and it just wouldn't work. My laptop showed no connectivity, the little charge light on the brick didn't go on, and after tinkering with the thing at length I couldn't get anything to change. If you want a cheap, temporary replacement charger, I guess this would be fine. But for anything long-term it might just be worth shelling out $80 for something that at least lasts a year or two."
2,Power connector is not durable,"Adapter worked flawlessly for six months, then became intermittent. Seems to be broken or shorted somewhere near the connector to the computer. Even the ridiculously flimsy cord from Apple lasted longer than six months, so I can't say I'm pleased. Macally says they'll sell the connector cable separately for $17.00 which is not much of a bargain."
1,Terrible product. Broke twice. Don't buy!!!,Don't buy!!! This charger does not work. It broke twice before Amazon told me they would not send me another. The customer service was excellent from Amazon.
5,Great replacement.,"We have 3 PowerBooks in the house, and 2 of them are using these cords now when their OEM powercords fizzled out - as the apple cords are known to do. While they don't light up, they do their intended job, and they do so without overheating QUITE as bad as the original cord. It still gets warm, so give it some space, but overall, a very nice product."
2,Be wary of this charger,"I was hoping for a cheaper replacement, but what I got was a charger that was not much more reliable than my previous Apple charger.The problem with this connector is that it doesn't always seem to make a good connection with the computer. When this happens, it sends the computer into a powered-charging-battery loop. I have to fiddle with the connector to get it in just the right spot to keep a good connection. While this is only an annoyance to me, I wonder what it's doing to the internals of my computer."
4,Top Notch Product,"The Macally PS-AC4 is a great replacement item for the OEM power unit. A bit larger than the original, it provides an easy velcro strap that easily contains the wires or releases them to do their duty. Easy to use with a better strain relief than that of the OEM. The loss of the tell-tale light at the base of the adapter plus is missed, but hte positives out weight this little omission."
4,Does the job,"This is a solid replacement for Apple's charger. It is light weight and does the job it was intended to do. Blue ""on"" light simply tells you it's plugged in, but there's no indicator to tell you when the computer is fully charged. Lacks the portability elegance of the Apple charger, but costs a lot less."
5,Exactly what I hoped for,"My husband and I both have Mac laptops and the dog chewed his charger to pieces (yay!) and after five years of use, my charger literally started smokig while it was plugged in (yay!)I went to the Mac company store to buy new chargers, but at a whopping 79.99 I only bought one. I found the MacAlly charger on Amazon.com and decided to give it a try. When we got it and tried it out I immediately returned the Mac brand charger for a refund. I love the MacAlly charger! Its actually long enough to be practical. It doesn't fall out of the wall socket from its own weight (imagine that.) And it never gets hot enough to fry eggs.BUY IT! It's less than half the cost of the brand name, it's a more practical design, and it's still small enough to fit into my little laptop bag. Sure, its not as novel or cute, and it doesn't have the little Apple insignia on it, but I'm not paying eighty bucks for one charger when I could buy the two that I needed for about the same."
3,"It works, but charges rreeeeaaall sssloowwww...","The price is nice, but charging time is twice as long.I'm using this on a 17"" G4 Powerbook.For example:-when your battery runs out and the computer shuts down, with the stock battery it's about a 3 second wait (once you connect the plug) and you can turn your computer on.-with this charger, it takes about a minute before the computer gets enough of a charge to get things going again.-then it takes twice as long to get to full charge.It's still a good buy compared to the price of an Apple brand charger, but there is a pay off..."
4,"Does the job, price is right","Considering it costs less than half the price of the original Apple adapter, it's a wonderful piece of equipment. it's great it is white as the iBook, and the cable that goes to the laptop is stronger than the original one. Just two thing to have in mind: it isn't able to charge a completely drained battery and run heavy apps at the same time; the other thing is that I miss the green and ambar light in the original connector!"
5,Don't scrounge for the second-gen Apple adapter! This is your ticket!,"I don't know how long I searched and searched for a replacement for myPowerbook G4 power adapter replacement. I looked at Computer City,Apple Stores, apple.com, and even Ebay. The old adapters aren't availablein either of the two stores and online the adapters can hit you up for 80bucks! Ugh!This adapter works great with the generation of apple laptops before theMagSafe adapters and it's much less prone to malfunction and designflaws that will enable it to rip, etc. Very elegant, too."
5,FABULOUS! Recommend it over the genuine Mac alternative.,Couldn't be more satisfied with this product! And the low price ...I've bought my last $80 Mac adapter. They can fook right orf !!!:-)
4,very nice power adapter,not bad for the price. the little box part of it gets really hot though. in my opinion it charges the computer faster than the power cord that came with the computer.
2,Charging problems,"I bought this product to replace the original battery charger that came with my 12"" Powerbook G4. Unfortunately, it seems that it only will add charge when I have the computer closed or off. If I have the computer open while the charger is plugged in, it not only doesn't add charge, it also makes the screen brightness oscillate.I wouldn't recommend this product for anyone who needs to charge their Powerbook while using their Powerbook. Wish I would've just spent the extra money on the Apple charger."
2,If you're tempted to throw away $30....,"I bought this charger near the end of May of this year and it stopped working about 2 weeks ago. It is not the same charger as in the picture with the gray cord. It looks just like most of the other generic chargers available on Amazon. It charges quite slowly (ibook g4 14""). I have a brand new APPLE brand battery, so I don't think it has anything to do with that or the computer. From now on I will stick with the cheaper generic chargers until my computer is totally dead."
3,Only lasted 8 months,"My old adapter died a while ago, and since this appears to be the only charger still made that works for my iBook G4, I had no choice but to buy it. It has only been 8 months since I bought it, but the plastic coating on the wire near the block has broken open, leaving the wire bare. (And no, I don't wrap the cord tightly or anything-- when transporting it, I just fold it loosely. The plastic has to have been pretty fragile for it to break from so little stress.) It also makes an extremely high pitched noise when charging the laptop battery after it's been drained.It's still working for now, but I'm not comfortable having it plugged in when I'm not in the room, in case it decides to start a fire. Guess it's time to buy a new one... *sigh*"
1,Plug DOESN'T work with the iBook G4,"This product is advertised to work with the iBook G4, but it does NOT.This plug looks fine, but despite what the product description stats, it isn't compatible with the 3- to 5-year-old version of the 12-inch iBook G4, which I own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one didn't work.Consider yourself warned."
1,Stopped Working Day 3,"Out of the difficult to open package, this adapter worked for a couple of days.I missed the light on the end of the standard Apple adapter (yellow for charging, green for charged).But the price was right, until, it started cycling on and off. The Mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten. Boy, was I glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between a/c and battery. Unplugged the Macally, computer ran fine on just battery. Runs fine on the Apple charger I had left at home.The good news is the return to Amazon was extremely easy, presuming the lack of destroyed packaging doesn't void my refund.I've ordered a different brand (with light!). This one may have just been a bad example. I've had good luck with other Macally gear."
1,"sparked, then didn't work",We plugged this on only to have it spark and not power our ibook G4. It went back the next day.
1,Another defective one...,"This product would intermittently charge my computer, charging about half of the time and not charging the other half. It has 3 1/2 stars as an average from so many reviews because you get exactly what you pay for with this one - a cheap alternative.I was happy with the first one I bought. It lasted about a year and a half with heavy use. I thought I'd try another one but odds are you'll end up with a defective one of you buy a few of them."
1,Disappointing and dangerous,"Like every other Mac user, I think the replacement power cord with the bulky, cumbersome block is overpriced and less than durable, so I decided to outsource. What I got was never quite up to speed, but since my laptop mostly stays plugged in, the quick charge wasn't a must. Unfortunately, after a scant 8 months, with very little movement or unplugging (I've packed up my laptop for travel exactly twice in that time), the power cord has given out. There seems to be a short between the wires, with the hazardous side effect of causing random sparking at the connection between the computer plug-in and the wire. Needless to say, I'm not going back to this product!"
4,Nice low-cost option. Very pleased.,"Very pleased with this product that I bought as a replacement for a worn out Apple power cable. Apple has changed their plug system with the newest machines, but for anyone out there with a Pre-Intel Mac this is a great option at half the price of Apple's own product. Only gripe is that there is no power indicator light on the plug end, which is a feature on Apple's stock power cord."
4,nice deal,"- while lacking the green/amber light on the end of the plug, it *does* have a bright blue LED on the brick itself. the LED doesn't change color according to what the powerbook is doing, it just indicates if the brick itself has power.- it produces 2 amps, rather than the 2.65 put out by apple's. this means that while it's ok for older ibooks and tibooks, for the new albooks it's slower to charge the battery if the machine is on, and for some machines like the newer 17"", may not be able to charge the battery unless the laptop's asleep.(this can be annoying at times, but for less than half the cost of apple's adapter and cheaper than most other 3rd party adapters, I think it's a fair deal)- the wire on the powerbook side twist-locks into the brick, so you can't yank it out accidentally.- no, the plug isn't grounded... but then again neither is apple's flip-out plug.overall, I think this is a pretty good deal, and might pick up another."
3,The Long and the Short,"While the MacAlly powerbook ac adapter has it all over the original ac charger in terms of length (it's nice to get further away from the outlet to be sure), it's not altogether reliable as a charger. There are many times when I'll find, if I haven't been paying strict attention, that the cord has shifted slightly and, though it looks like it's still plugged in, it is no longer charging the computer. I've left it charging overnight to find in the morning that the battery is still not full. Makes me appreciate the charge indicator ring on the original cord that much more, too bad the Apple cords are A)given to dangerous wear & tear, and B)expensive to replace."
3,Not too bad but...,"This book was a good read until the last chapters. The story line begins to unravel a bit toward the end. There are pieces left unfinished and the ending itself was so poor that I thought my copy must be missing the last chapter. Most of Binchy's novels are beautifully polished. Unfortunately, this one leaves the silver somewhat tarnished."
2,A disappointment,"Maeve's forte is character development, dialogue, and interaction, and Silver Wedding was far below her usual standard."
3,Not a Classic Binchy,"This book did not give the depth that Binchy usually has. It had a very week storyline and the reader did not get to truly know a character. I am a great Binchy fan, but was disappointed in this one. The story was too predictable."
3,Review,I read the book to the finish but found that her writing style was the same for each book I had read and the characters were boring by this time.
4,"Wonderful characterisation, as always","I am a great fan of Maeve Binchy's writing. I love her detailed character observation and how it lets the reader recognise bits of people in her characters. Silver Wedding centres around a 25th wedding anniversary and the plethora of dilemmas such a seemingly straightforward celebration can cause. Anyone who has ever organised a family event such as this will love the descriptions of family politics, and I'm sure many will sympathise with the heroine's family traumas and how being 'the responsible one' can lead to all sorts of complications, not to mention that vaguely disquieting feeling of being put upon. A good read."
4,Silver Wedding,"Started off a bit slow but now I am hooked, not finished yet but cant wait for my next oppertunity to carry on with it"
4,Okay read,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that this was not her best novel. I would have rathered her write about only half the characters and go into more depth about those. I would get so into a story and then it would end, and the person wouldn't be heard of again until the anniversary celebration. I did like the part about the various invites to the party which had been answered, (Not a direct quote) - ""They would send flowers and a card,but would not attend, and that is the way it should be"" It was a quick read, though - great for a rainy weekend or a trip to the beach. Also try TARA ROAD - a good novel as well."
3,Parts 1 and 2 GREAT! Part 3...Ehhh.,"I enjoyed the first two thirds of this book as much as any novel of the frontier I have ever read. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with part 3. The whole tone of the third segment was jarringly anachronistic and peppered with little in-jokes, for example, a Delaware indian is named Lenny LeNapier. The actual name of the Delaware tribe was Leni Lenape. I felt like I was suddenly reading a comic book with '90s people plunged into the 1840's. It seemed like Jones wrote the first two parts as a serious frontier story, then said ""To Hell with it!"" and turned the last portion into a farce. What a letdown, after the excellent beginning and middle, not to mention the author's superb The Buffalo Runners, where the authentic historical tone is maintained throughout."
4,informative,i have been doing the i ching for over 20 - 25 years and this book is veryinformative and it gives other ways of divining that is not in thewilhelm baynes classic. i highly recommend it.
3,It's not the greatest,The novel was engrossing and it caught and held my attention. But the book lacked a good heroine since Esther didn't actually do anything amazing. She was just a little adventurous and appealing to all Invaders.
5,Mindcrime at the Moore,Absolutely amazing. that's the only way to describe this DVD A must have for any Queensryche fans.
3,Not what I expected,"Well I thought this would be a good addition to our concert dvd collection to listen to in our in home bar. While I love Queensryche, I have never seen them in concert and therefore was not aware their stage show is more like going to a play. I have gone to a lot of concerts and have not seen acting on stage. I guess some of you die hards like my husband expected it but it was distracting to me. It was hard to enjoy the beautiful, creative songs while watching such bad acting. And might I add that I felt as though ALL of the songs were lipsynched because the vocals were just too exact and sounded exactly the recorded versions. Bottom line, I would've rather played their cd's on my ipod than watch the heavy metal soap opera."
4,Get this and Livecrime,"To really get the complete Mindcrime experience, I would recommend getting the Operation: Livecrime DVD as well. If you can find the one with the booklet, even better. Watch the first part on the Livecrime DVD and the 2nd part on this DVD. The original Mindcrime with the original lineup cannot be topped. For the most part, they did a great job considering they don't have the budget for live shows they had in the early 90's. Mindcrime 2 is not at the level of the first part. Who expects it to be?"
1,Queensryche & Seattle Suck,"This performance is pure garbage. Unfortunately I was at this pathetic show. The audience was mostly old geezers who were there to watch a group of other geriatric has-beens. The sound was awful, their performance of West Side Story was ridiculous, and their hatred for America was sad. Halfway through the show, the singer was having serious trouble hauling his fat *ss around the stage. He sounded like an exhausted pig, gorging himself at the trough. It was bad enough that they would embarrass themselves by performing in front of people, but they actually recorded their disaster. Now they think they can sell this crap??"
3,Stick to singing Geoff,"Well, lets start with general impressions. Overall this is a good DVD. The sound is great and the video is great. The band pulls off both Mindcrime discs very well live. It's true that Geoff Tates voice has had better days, but he sounds a lot better on this than he did on Live Evolution. However, his acting leaves much to be desired. I don't know why he decided to sport the Madonna microphone and act out parts of the show. He kind of reminded me of Meat Loaf in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. But like I said, overall this is a great disc for Queensryche fans. I highly recommend it."
1,Cheap corkscrew,"It's awful. I bought it because I wanted a red corkscrew. However, the description does not state how cheaply it is made. Each time I use it I'm afraid it's going to break when I turn it. It's plastic. DO NOT BUY!"
3,Is it worth doing this for 90 days?,"Power 90 is one of the greatest workout DVDS. As a 15 year old, i would say that its a good way to get that body you want. ""Ab Ripper"" is one of the best exercises. ""Sculpt"" is a good exercise to get muscles in your arms and chest. ""Sweat"" is real dull. You can get the same results from kicking, punching, and dancing. But it still works out your calves effectivly.But one of the most annoying thing on this DVD is the commericals. Theres about 2 hours worth of ""so-called"" doctors pressuring to sell you vitamins that will help you get better results. As if i need more pressure... Also, is it worth doing the exercise every day for 90 days? But anyways, its a good DVD to get great results.(P.S. I think Tony Horton is obsessed with people sweating. You'll see what i mean if you buy this DVD.)"
3,"Good for beginners, but gets a little boring","This is a simple workout that is good for those who've never worked out before (like my husband, who's doing it with me). I really like the strength exercises, but the sweat exercises (cardio) are simple and get really boring after a month. I like that the people on the video don't get a rest--they're doing the whole video just like the rest of us. We alternated sweat/abs 1-2 and sculpt 1-2 for the first 30 days. We're on day 44 and we're alternatiing the 1-2 and 3-4 sets now (gives us a little rest in between the more difficult ones, or if we just wake up too late to do the longer one). I'm ready to move on to something else, though. I don't know if I can do 46 more days of this..."
4,Great to use BEFORE P90X,"If you are not in really good shape this is a great product to get ready for P90X. It does get kind of boring because you are doing the same workouts every other day, but they do work. It is only about 30 mins but it is amazing how well it works."
1,does not work,"I purchased this product and the DVD's don't even work. I can't even use them. I get nothing,no picture,nothing."
2,not worth it,it surprisingly contained very little substance. just 1 half hour workout per disk. got boring fast too. i found better stuff free on the internet.
5,It leaves you wondering...,"The Spanish version of Brian Weiss's book, ""Muchas vidas, muchos sabios"" is even more intriguing to me than my English version. (La version del libro de Brian Weiss es aun mas intrigante para me que la version en Ingles.) For those who believe in reincarnation, this is a great book (Para aquellos que creen en la reincarnacion, este es un gran libro.)"
2,Very disappointing,"I ordered this new knife from Amazon based on the Laguiole name, prior Sabatier experience and the one review (5 stars). What a disappointment! One side of the blade had very visible tarnish and reddish blue spots (not sure whether rust or previously used). It also has a very light and extremely cheap look with poor manufacture. It is made in France, but it goes to show that junk comes out from there just as easy as from China, Pakistan or anywhere else. True you get what you pay for, but this one wouldn't be worth even 2 bucks at a yard sale. Maybe it was a defective unit, but I didn't want to take a chance with a replacement. I never even tried to use it, and simply returned it. To Amazon's credit, their return process was great. Just follow the online ""return"" process, print the (free/prepaid) return label, and take it to any USPS station. Amazon's service earned the second extra star."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this boombox for a kitchen that I knew needed to be loud. While the Hummer MusiXstation looks amazing and has pretty good functionality, the sound quality and volume is very low. To be honest, I wish it sounded like it looked. The radio is not very good at picking up FM stations, either. It does have a Audio in jack, which was very helpful and not available on a lot of other models.I was not impressed overall, and we switched back to our 1998 boombox in the kitchen.Pros: Looks amazing, seems durable, cool features (including audio in)Cons: Not very loud, sound quality is decent at best, subwoofer is a joke, digital FM radio not very receptive"
1,Bad band,The band was far too thin and would roll down my leg continuously. I returned all pairs I bought for a refund. Very disappointing for a Jobst product.
1,Wouldn't stay up,The band was far too thin and would roll down my leg continuously. I returned all pairs I bought for a refund. Very disappointing for a Jobst product.
3,Legends of the Outer Banks and Tar Heel Tidewater,"Charles Whedbee is a storyteller and this is reflected in his writing style. I found the style a bit abrupt and halting, but the most of the stories were interesting enough that I did not mind. ""Legends of the Outer Banks and Tar Heel Tidewater"" tells the local tales of this North Carolina coastal area. The stories start as early as the first settlement, continue through until WWII and cover everything from Blackbeard and Hatteras Jack to the fate of Aaron Burr's only daughter.While I think I would much rather sit by a fire and listen to Mr. Whedbee tell his stories, I still think it was worth the time spent reading them. There are some wonderful little gems of North Carolina history hidden in these pages."
4,excellent!,"Received my order promptly, as promised. No defects to the dvd, other than the content is very old, from the 70'si will enjoy this for years and my grandchildren will see this and make.their own decisions! I am glad to find a rare addition to my Bigfoot collection"
4,Great Historical Fiction!!!,This book was a great historical fiction!!! This book was about Colonel Knox and his journey to FT. Ticonderoga to get guns for general Washington. The story had lots of action and I would definitely recommend it to history lovers!!!!!
1,My thoughts on a terrible book,"This book is about colonel Knox a leader of a freshly starting revolution in America. His mission is to carry around 200 cannons from Ticonderoga back to a city where British forces are docked. The main characters of this book are will Knox 19 year old brother of the colonel, colonel Knox in charge of expedition, J.P. a farmers son .I disliked this book. It drags on and never seems to end. Just when you think your going to get a fight there isn't one .the biggest problem they had on the trip was a river with too thin ice. What's so interesting about that? If I were you I would not buy this book. It is extremely boring.From a reader of this book"
4,A Fun Book to Stimulate Interest in History,This is a fun book that should help your youngster develop an interest in American History. It is easy to read an has great illustratiions. You will not be disappointed with this purchase. Look for others by the same author.
4,book,appears to be a great book for my 5th grader who loves history. i am sure that he will be able to discuss with his class. Good purchase
2,Did not fit 2004 Kia Optima LX,"I purchased this for my 2004 Kia Optima LX. When I went to install it, everything seemed good. But the car was about an inch wider than the hitch and the hitch was not centered in the car. So either the hitch was off center or the car's mounts were. Otherwise seemed like a great hitch."
4,Offers some interesting insights,"The author is seen by enthusiasts of socialist capitalism, also known as Rhineland capitalism, as a sort of guru. He preaches that a company is a living entity, whose main aim is to perpetuate itself, regardless of shareholder, or even stakeholder, interest.I have no use for this type of thinking. The interesting contribution he makes is the concept of the ""memory of the future"", which any organization can use to better prepare itself for whatever comes in the future."
4,"creative, interesting approach to Greece","I like the mainstream of travel books, but I've never seen one designed quite this way. The author has woven a plain-language retelling of parts of Homer with descriptions of the modern Greeks as he came to know them. Fair play to the author: he has given us something refreshingly different.Lundgren writes clear, quality prose with above average descriptive talent. His deep affection for his subject is evident throughout, which warmed my heart as it deviates from the accepted journalistic principle (one I despise) of pretending to have no real human feelings. I tend to believe that a traveler learns more about a people when s/he tends to like them, and the author clearly does.Recommended for the travel reader willing to try a novel approach to the subject of culture study. For the travel reader with any interest at all in Homer, feel free to add a star."
4,Greek Time Travel,"This was an interesting and engrossing book about Greece (including its surrounding islands) which helps connect the historical world of Ancient Greece with the scenery and people found there today. (Reading it with a map or atlas handy would definitely enhance the experience).The first half retells the story of Odysseus and his journey to Troy, with a special emphasis on the sites as we know them today (great for those preparing for a trip to Greece - especially if you're interested in getting a handle on the names and significance of the various islands). The second half emphasizes personal stories of the author's own travels and visits to Greece which bring to life its land, people, personality and culture of Greece.Fascinating and enjoyable!"
5,"Oh, so cool!","Such a cool check book cover! Seems very durable and will last a long time. Very roomy, yet slim enough to fit in my little purse! Excellent price and very prompt shipping. A definate converstion piece."
5,The most beautiful Cd I've ever bought.,As a big fan of classical persian music and an Iranian I recommand this cd to anyone intersted in molavi's and nazeri's work.This very diffrent and amazing work by dastan and nazeri is for sure the best work i heard from them.I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I do.
3,An open and open case,"If you are a fan of murder mysteries, then you must read Van Dine, who was a pivotal figure in the development of that genre. Unfortunately, if you are a longtime fan, this particular story will seem rather feeble. You will guess the general form of the solution very early on. But, it is of its time. When it was written, both the plot and the writing style would have been fresh and original. Now, it is a period piece. It gives fascinating insights into American 1920s society, and shows where the early Ellery Queen came from.Recommended for serious fans of the genre, but don't expect a 'never would have guessed it' moment.[PeterReeve]"
4,A well liked gift,"I bought this for my father as a gift. He seems to really enjoy it. Being something he had in years past, the hand held infrared devices became a little hard to locate. While this one doesn't seem to have the super high build quality that ones did from years gone by, it does the job and as the gift receiver my father seems to be very satisfied with it."
2,heat therapy,"I used this product a couple of times and was not really impressed. To get good results I guess you would have to use it in a specific area for a good length of time, otherwise not much good."
1,Infrared MASSAGER,Amazon responded immediately but forwarded to the supplier. Don't waste your money. It's a hand held wand that may or may not be infrared. Doesn't heat up to any degree that will be helpful. Still waiting to hear back from the supplier (two weeks now) to return this item. Know someone who has the EXACT same item and paid $10.... Enough said
5,Clear and Concise Introduction to Palmistry,"In my opinion, Richard Webster's Revealing Hands is quite simply the best introduction to the fascinating subject of palmistry. Students will find the material to be concise and easily comprehensible, unlike many other chirological texts. This fine book is a mandatory addition to the library of any aspiring or professional palmist."
4,Best palmistry book and why......,"I have many books on plamistry. Some have too much info to ever retain, some are way too basic. This one is just right for EVERYBODY. Here's why:* The history is brief (about 4-5 pages which is all you will ever need to know on the topic unless you are devoting to major study* The book tells you HOW to give a reading and a SCRIPT to follow. VERY FEW BOOKS DO THIS!!! This is worth it's weight in gold. I typed his script out and left blanks and when I give a reading I fill it in like a 'mad lib' but relevant to age and the palm.* Nothing vague about it. BIG pictures. Excellent area on fingers too.Richard Websters best material is not sold to lay people but this books seems to be the exception."
5,..I Found This Excellent!,"Looking for a Palm Reading Bible you will go back to over all other pretty, colorful and modern New Age Palm Reading books? This is the one! Out of all the Palmistry books I go back to over and over when professional palm reading, this is the book I turn to. Why? Its black and white, diagrams give plenty of writing space for quick notes, writing style is down to earth and basic. For basic/intermediate study, this is a book based on old traditional rules.....Not a health study, more a realistic character study....I consider it the best I have in my Palmistry Library."
2,Halica Bliss Out v.11...,"...is the full and misleading name of this album, one that is as run of the mill as a fan of electronic metamusic could desire. This album has seven tracks, ranging in time from 3-11 minutes, but don't let that fool you into thinking there's much variety. All of them meld together after the first, ""Fish"", which is the highlight among few others that are moderately well-crafted and distinct. There is a definite feeling of sonic recycling (""didn't I just hear that whir on the previous track?"") and a limited sound spectrum within their grasp. One can't expect too terribly much from indie techno, so its unfair to condemn this album for lack of equipment. It's usually competent, even musical, but when an occasional vocal bit is all that differentiates one track from another, one tends to seek greener electropastures."
5,Pure Funk,"This is just great music. Funk through the eyes of the great Eddie Palmieri. A total fusion of the time period. A mix of funky, jazzy latin rock-a little like the band ""War""."
1,"book only, no jacks",I bought this book from Amazon in used condition but 'like new'. Little did I realize or even think about that it didn't come with the jacks and ball. Now I have to try to find the right size jacks (not jumbo ones) and a ball. I guess you get what you pay for!
4,Cacho,"Excelente DC, aunque la grabación que fue en vivo y con un auditorio muy admirador de Cacho a veces entorpece el sonido."
2,THIS COLLECTION IS INCOMPLETE,"THE STIFFS WERE A GOOD SOFT BAND.THIS CD IS SUPPOSED TO BE A COLLECTION OF THEIR BEST WORK. BUT MISSING IS HERE ARE THE SONGS 'D.C.RIP' AND ANOTHER GREAT TRACK FROM THAT 7"". FOR CAPTAIN OI!TO LEAVE OUT SUCH AWESOME WORK IS DISTURBING. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS RELEASE. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TITLED""THE STIFFS_LOVE SONGS COLLECTION"". THE BAND ITSELF RATES BETTER THAN 2 STARS, BUT NOT HAVING THE SONGS IT SHOULD OF HAD,GREATLY DEPRECIATES THIS CD."
1,The Stench,"I just used this product for the first time and will be returning it.The cheap cologne smell is inescapable. Wash your face with this stuff and you'll be smelling it all day.I popped the top and smelled it at the store, but after using it the smell is much stronger."
3,The Monkey's Paw,"I think that adults would appreciate this story a lot more then kids. I read it in my English class, and I wasn't scared or anything. I didn't especially like the story, and found it hard to understand. I think that if I was older that I would enjoy the story. I reccommend it for adults, but not for kids, like me."
1,Monkeys Paw,How can anyone like this book??? its got to be the worst horror book I have ever read and I normaly like a good horror book now and then. I mean most Horror books or movies give me the creeps this one I could resd in the scaryest place in the world yaw and go to sleep. got to be the worst book ever writen by the way I am 13 just dont wana give out my account name on here later
1,Incomplete Edition,The hard cover reprint edition offered by Amazon and others is incomplete. It contains Part 1 only. Note the page count (208) and compare it to the trade paperback versions (310-324 page count).Avoid this edition.
2,Blurred Audio,"Audio is technically flawed. The instumental sounds are Not crisp and clear. The musical selections and the Ellington orchestration are excellent. But the unclear Audio makes listening to this album like viewing a blurred, out of focus photograph. Definitely NOT a worthwhile selection for serious Duke Ellington afficionados."
5,Great extra pieces,We always need these extra little pieces and couldn't find them anywhere. Great to find them here and good quality for the price!
5,Reunited with Reunion,"From the first tune, the chills came back. And when Glen rips into the words early on in Just This One Time, I was back to the old chair with the vinyl on the stereo. The tunes are a testament to Webb's remarkable writing and arranging talents. He puts himself up for all to see and speaks as if he has read my thoughts. Such a long lost treasure found again....thanks to the Aussies for put it all together! Now I must get back to listening...and smiling!"
5,The Finest Material Available - Period,"I can't express my gratitude at the reviews I've read enough - I remember finding ""Reunion"" in the remainder bin at a Caldor's a couple of decades ago. I couldn't believe what I was listening to when I got it home. How could this album not be a top seller, I thought? ""Wishing Now"" is one of the most achingly joyous, if that's the best way to put it, songs of longing you'll ever hear. ""You Might As Well Smile"" is a masterpiece of soulful humanity. ""The Moon's a Harsh Mistress"" is pure poetry set to music. One of the GREAT albums of all time - period."
4,Ol' Bearded-One does it again!,"I couldn't resist, I had to own this CD. Kenny's voice on these easy-listening standards was worth listening to. So I tried it, and was I ever taken aback. His rough, yet soothing voice unwrapped a new sound to these classics. It's hard to compare, because these are proven songs, but Kenny's effort deserves recognition."
2,Definitely not a must have,"Nice pictures, but no descriptions and the map on the book doesn't even mention Merritt IslandBuy a proper birdbook rather than this overpriced pamphlet"
3,Almost there,"It was worth the price. The wood is nice enough. The dimensions are inaccurate, however: it is actually 14.5 inches deep - not 11.5 as featured. I purchased it because it was for a drawer that is only 12 inches deep. I am able to use it in another drawer, so all ends well. The construction method involved the use of staples that promptly popped out after a little stress - so I hammered in a couple of fine finishing nails to replace them and it works just fine."
3,Does the Job,The Loc-A Ball feature has no possibility of working. There is more than 3/32 of an inch clearance between the boxes. The balls probably stick out about 1/16. I screwed the boxes together so it works but not as designed. I was worried that I would split the wood so I stayed away from the ends and drilled and countersunk the holes for the screws. I used only one screw for each side so the box does not slide relative to it self. I would have liked to have used two screws each side but I decided to not take the chance of spliting the wood. I have since seen a similar box at a big box store which would have been a better value.
3,it is a product of when it was written,"i think that this book has to be understood as, first and foremost, a women's studies title and also very much a product of when it was written. also of the times that the author is actually recounting, which was in the 60s/70s/80s. if you keep that context, then i think a lot of what it is criticized for is more understandable. it's dated. it could be deeper. and, yes, the author does come over as a bit self-focused. but it's not the worst account out there, either. worth borrowing from the library?"
3,a mixed bag,"The insider/outsider view of Amish life is most interesting and, I thought, fair, in that there are aspects which she finds admirable and would like to bring into her own life and other aspects which, though interesting, she would not like to adopt. In most instances, I would wholeheartedly agree with Sue Bender's point of view, and appreciate the time and effort she took to become so acquainted with the Amish families and the message she offers. I knew Sue and Richard Bender when I was a student in Berkeley, visited their home a few times and found it and them to be most admirable, as artists and as people. I was inspired by the way they lived their lives. But I agree with numerous other reviewers that there is an annoying narcissism in the telling. Perhaps the inward-looking story of how she was changed as an artist should have been another book or been more fully declared on the jacket."
1,There is no insight to be gained after finishing this book.,"It is absolutely unbelievable this woman IS a therapist, by reading her book, she NEEDS one. She relates to clay more than to children or people. Whatever she was looking for in an Amish community, she never found it and translates that to the reader. Don't waste your time with this very poor read."
2,Author is WAY too self-absorbed,"I wanted to read this book because the simple life of the Amish people intrigued me.I wish this lady would have talked more about the Amish.Instead,all you read about is ""Me,me,me"".""What am I doing in my life?""Why do I do this/that?"" blah blah blah.By the end of the book the reader really doesn't care anymore!It was scarey for me to find out that this woman is a therapist-YIKES!The reason I gave it 2 stars is that (1) When she does talk about the Amish it is interesting (2) It is a short book and a quick read."
1,Really horrible book,"This book is a self-centered piece of random musings. It is not about the Amish. It is about the author, and frankly, she's not someone I would really care to meet and discuss important issues with. She spends SO much time on HER thoughts, HER ideas, that one forgets this is supposed to be a book about the Amish way of life. This is not a journey TO the Amish. It is a boring, breathtakingly conceited journey into the author's confused mind. I suggest counseling for her. Her book just plain stinks."
2,She did not get the point.,"I thought this book was a sad commentary on the lostness of the author. Though she sought to understand the Amish way of life, she totally missed what it is all about. Maybe it was because the church service was in German or maybe she was so focused on herself that she could not see beyond to the fact that peace comes from a relationship with God. Her final line in the book stated that miracles take a lot of work. I would beg to disagree and say that God is the one who does miracles and therefore they take no work, just faith. This is what Sue Bender missed and is still missing I am afraid. We use Amish textbooks in our home education program, so the insights she shared were not really new to me. I think her description of the Amish is valid, but her understanding is lacking. I would not particularly recommend this book."
3,quick and interesting,"I enjoyed the author's plain and simple narrative and pictures in this book. Her story was well told using unadorned pictures and unembellished prose. It set a nice tone for her entire experience and for her struggles of letting herself just be who she is and accepting it. The only disturbing part of this book was that she left her family because of an ""inner voice"". What about listening to the voice of reason?"
2,Disgrace of a book for anyone who studies the Amish writings,"2 stars is pretty generous, in my opinion. This book seemed more like a book about the process she went through writing a book about visiting Amish families. I found myself wondering where I might be able to find the book she spent so much time ""pouring her soul into"". The book is largely spent talking about how incredible she is for having completed such a daunting task and is filled with many backhanded remarks regarding Amish communities. She comes off pompous and self-indulgent, not at all like the humbled, pious woman she paints herself out to be. Would recommend skipping this book."
2,Plain and Simple: A Journey to the Amish,"This is a very disapointing book. The author makes the complexe Amish community that forgave the muders of their young daughters at Nickle Mine school into one diminsional Disney characters. There is no tension, conflict or any of the human conditions that make people real, just a oh so sweet group of simple people.Of course that does not allow us to learn anything from the Amish and I am sure there is a lot to be learn from them.The author is very self absorbed when she tries to draw any lessons from her time with the Amish. There were spots where I though ""O please get over yourself"". I didn't finish the book, it was a waste of time."
4,"Disappointing, but revealing","This was a nice book to read. It was pleasantly vivid, especially when talking about amish food habits (heaps of ice cream and all kinds of fattening food). I enjoyed the descriptions. the author's own disturbing and overwhelming need to express herself reasserts itself at the book's end, and as we move out of the sublime simplicity back to the mainstream American's need for selfish self-expression of every nitwit feeling and emotion and intuition I felt a bit nauseous. The book is a clear snapshot of a symptom of self-obsession which is perhaps most obvious in San Francisco, where this book is a best seller."
1,PLEASE,You sure must have missed a lot on your JOURNEY.The Amish are the most backwards group of misfits I have ever encountered.Where kids beat on when you were they? Were wives talked down to and belitted? Were animals beat and starved? I thought not. Maybe you should take another trip...and tell it like it really is. I do not think much of your book. It is NOT TRUE
5,Plain and Simple,"I felt this was an extremely well written and moving little book, and I have recommended it to many friends. In fact, I bought copies and sent them out. It made you stop and think about your own life and how we complicate and prioritize."
4,"Interesting, for what it is","This is the story of how one woman became interested in the Amish and decided to try and live with them for awhile. It is interesting to read how an outsider would go about getting into this very secretive world. Her experiences are not representative of all Amish - as she says in the book, there are many variations of belief and practice among Amish all across the country. I was surprised to hear about Amish using a telephone, motorized pumps, polyester clothing, running shoes, and plastic, or using store-bought white bread and cereal that is laced with supplements.The author did not have this experience to become Amish and she returns to her normal life, but with some appreciation for simplicity in the modern world. For those who find resonance in such a concept, I recommend reading Barry Schwartz's THE PARADOX OF CHOICE: WHEN MORE IS LESS, for expanded development of that idea."
2,The book presents history from a pro-arab stance.,"The book presents a historical and political account of the middle east from 1922-1984. The book was originally written in 1968, then revised in 1976 and 1985. During the process of revision, Khouri, appearantly, did not make many changes in the original text, a fact that leaves much of the book outdated. Khouri's account takes a strong anti Israeli and pro Arab stance. For example, he chooses to downplay the Palestinian terrorist attacks during the 1970s and mentions such attacks as the attack on the Israeli athletes in Munich and the attack of the Marine base in Beirut with no detail. His study is based very closely on UN records and ignores the reality of the Middle East."
1,a real pain,I bought this item 2 months ago because it was small and cheap. I use it daily. The grinding mechanism is already tired. Now it takes a lot of patience to actually get the desired amount of pepper/salt and it's getting on my nerves. So I'm browsing amazon for a real and efficient mill set.To be fair there is one thing I like in this product: the magnets that let you stick them to the cooker hood.
1,Don't waste your mony,Don't waste your money on these. They don't grind well at all. I just bought celtic sea salts and got rid of my table salt and was very disappointed as these just don't grind the salt or pepper. I have to go buy another set and hope they work.
5,plastic globe pepper/salt grinders,"glass globes would be a welcome addition to thesewonderful little pepper and salt grinders, with 1 hand yet, the glass woul make it feel more professional, or legtitament if you will thnx bert"
1,really cute magnets but...,horrible set of grinders. these handles broke before i had the chance to refill them! waste of money.
2,Poor durability and hard to fill,"Never satisfied with traditional mills, I bought these because they had a unique design. I liked that they stick to the fridge but have found that means I occasionally have to wipe off pepper flakes. The small, rectangular holes make funneling refills difficult and messy. About a month into light use, the pepper mill gummed up and cleaning was a real chore. After about a year of moderate use, the pepper mill just wasn't grinding properly anymore. Cute but not very durable."
1,waste of money,"hard to squeeze, hard to fill, hard to get more than a pinch of spice. there is a miniature hole to get salt and peppercorns in the units, they spill everywhere and don't hold much so you're always filling them. The handles are small and hard to hold. You have to squeeze them at least 30 times to get a decent amount of spice out."
1,Cannot adjust for coarseness,"The description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt/pepper, but there is no such knob on the mini grinders. We replaced the store bought salt with sea salt and now the grinder doesn't work. Disappointing."
2,Not for the serious minded..,"Perhaps the larger model works well. This smaller magnetic set is tragic. The only upside is that if you're working on your grip strength, these will probably help. To get a useable amount of pepper, you'll have to squeeze 15-20 times. They feel cheap and destined for a quick trip to the trash can. Stick with a tried and true twist grinder."
1,Broken in less than 1 month,"I purchased this pepper grinder at a kitchen outlet store. One of the ""rabbit ear"" handles snapped at the base after less than 1 month of use. I don't reccomend this product."
2,cute but don't,"Looks like cute little bunnies on my fridge, but they're just eye candy. Shakers don't store a lot of salt or pepper. Handles are too small to comfortably hold, and it's hard to detect any salt and pepper coming out."
1,review mni magnetic s& p set,Neither the salt mill or pepper grinder work well. It takes forever to get salt and pepper from the squeezing of the handles together and still not an adequate amount. Perhaps the blades that crunch the S&P are not sharp enough? Very disappointed in product.
2,Is cheap and thats it,Is cheap and does its jobBut the handle feel cheap and seems like is about to break.Sometime the peper chop a big chunk off
4,Good Book...........,"A delightful change of pace as far as the main hero (Luciano) is concerned. Higgins does the WWII background well no matter what the story. (or plot) He manages to stick to his facts from other novel about the ""Mafia Connection"" and German forces. Though some of these facts are repetitive he manages to keep his readers on the edge with this change of pace (and hero)."
3,Good authors abismal editors,"There are some good short stories in here that explore some interesting concepts. Others are poor and need some more work. All in all the fiction is good and worth getting but the editing is atrocious. This book is riddled with countless mistakes and misprints that should have been picked up by any half competent editor. None of them get in the way of the stories and it is always clear what the author meant. So the book is still worth buying unless little things like ""petal"" instead of ""pedal"" annoy you. In that case steer well clear of this book."
2,This is high school creative writing...,"I was quite disappointed with this collection. After the first three stories, I basically gave up. Interesting concepts that could have benefited a great deal from a really good editor. This stuff really belongs in 12th grade creative writing class."
2,"Substitute the name ""Burmese"" for any cat","Although books about particular cats/pets are rare and appreciated, I'm afraid this book gave me no further insight into my Burmese cat. Perhaps I am asking too much but I expected to find a plethora of special insights into this special breed. I didn't.Especially in modern cat care I felt this book lacking. My breeders says: Fresh meat three times a week; chicken wings (raw) at least twice for dental hygiene, vary the diet, enjoy the peculiarly dog like characteristics of the Burmese. But mabe that's all asking too much - gotta go, Nero is bringing his beloved yellow wash cloth for retrieval...It is hard to criticise a book that describes the best breed of cat on earth. Let's all write one!"
2,"Other than the History of the breed, not specific to a Burmese Cat at all!","I must agree with the other reviewer that this book offers no additional eye-opening facts in respect to owning a Burmese cat... The history section is specific to the breed (but as a new or existing Burmese owner, you'd probably already know this prior to getting one!) & there is one blurb regarding the Burmese characteristic to yowl when they require attention. Beyond that this book could really be for any other cat out there (feed your cat, give it water, groom it,...). It didn't even specify normal size/weight ranges for the breed and what quantities of food to give them as a guideline. So, in my opinion, useless to a new Burmese owner. Also, I was a bit disappointed that all of the photos are only of Sable & Chocolate Burmese (they are all gorgeous, but a few photos of Blues or Lilacs would be appreciated). All in all this book was disappointing."
4,"Guide to Owning a Burmese Cat: Feeding, Grooming, Health, Handling, Exhibition","This book is a great starters guide to owning and basic understanding of the history of Burmese cats. Useful basic information on care, feeding and breeding."
4,Just as good...,"If you have to get this book for a class and you want a less expensive alternative to the latest edition, this may be your answer. I am using this in my class right now and so far the differences are minimal."
5,"Stellar, as usual","BP remains the standard for baseball annuals, with zillions of player comments both informative and entertaining, and team comments which are generally excellent.They know more about more players than anyone else.Minor quibble: Every year the back cover exhalts BP's predictive prowess and gives examples, yet for some reason the 2001 edition fails to speak of, for instance, the success of the Minnesota Twins and Jeff Kubenka. But that's just marketing, I suppose -- it is a great book."
5,The New Standard Bearer,"BP sets the standard, not just for baseball books but for all annuals of any genre. The depth and breadth of coverage seems to grow each year. Whether you're a fantasy player or a hard core fan, this book is indispensable."
3,"Good, but not great","The stats and projections are all fantastic. However, I found the essays lacking and the book as a whole didn't live up to my lofty expectations. Next year, I will probably forgo buying the book and just stick with my subscription to the web-site."
4,Solid Effort...But Missing a Spark,"Statheads and fantasy players know that the value of this book is to be found in its statistics and projections for future performances. Anyone playing in a long-term keeper league will benefit by keeping this near them on draft day as they look for prospects to take flyers on. The stats in this book are as good as ever, as is the top-100 prospect list.This edition falls flat in its essays. In the past the essays read like great magazine articles that mixed stats and narrative in a 1:9 ratio. This year's essays are far more statitically driven, and are written in a 3:6 ratio, meaning that the flow of the articles is interuppted frequently by data analysis.This makes the book far dryer than usual, and more of a chore to get through. It's still invaluable as a reference tool, but as entertainment it falls a little short."
1,Bill James it ain't,"No doubt the worst of the many attempts to cop the ideas and success of Bill James, Pete Palmer, etc. over the past decade. Cute names and sophomoric humor aside, there isn't a great deal of meaningful analysis here, and if you take the time to go back and look at the previous year's addition, you will see that these guys are wrong a lot more often than they are correct. Their arcane formulas and measurements totally miss the point of something as simple and palatable as Runs Created, and the result is a dull and confusing mass of EqA's."
1,Not a fan,"Nothing here that you can't glean for yourself if you have a PC and know how to use Excel. Anyone can run numbers and models, and really that's all you get.The ""writing"" (purposeful quotes) is painful.Buying this book is no different than putting a match to your money."
4,A Story of Old England,"For those unfamiliar with Churchill, do not dive into this book looking for a university reader in English history. Churchill is a masterful writer and storyteller, and he weaves a tale for over 500 pages of the rise of England - from the pre-Roman times to the rise of the Tudors. Covering nearly 2000 years in 500 pages is a tall order, but Churchill spends adequate time on the major stories of the period. The book reads more like a novel than a scholarly history and the characters can come alive. A nice background on early English history for the ""casual"" reader."
4,I SPY for younger children,"Shipping was fast and packaging great. I was slightly disappointed that this seemed like an I Spy book for a much younger child than my 8 (almost 9 year old son)..... I wish I had known that ahead of time. Still, a great beginner I spy book, well put together and nice sturdy cover. Thank you."
4,Good for my toddler,It is perfect for my hyper toddler boy. He loves to spy items especially cars. I'll get more I spy books.
4,Markham sheds light on 'Napoleon',"In his book, 'Napoleon,' Felix Markham traces the rise and fall of one of the most important men in western history. As a biography, Markham sometimes relies too much questionable references, but as a history, 'Napoleon' ranks among the great works on the subject. The reports of the battles and the men who served the Emperor are first rate. One can almost imagine being at Marengo, Austerlitz or Waterloo, or riding alside Ney, Marmont, or Junot. Perhaps some of the most appealing aspects of this book are the accounts of Napoleon's life after his exile to St. Helena and the events surrounding his death. Markham also shows us how the Napoleonic legend helped to shape post-Imperial France. I would recomend this book to anyone who would like to know more about this facinating historical figure."
2,A Military History,"This may be a good book on military history. I am not a military historian, so I cannot attest to how sound Markham's research into that subject is. Just know what you are buying. There is almost nothing here about Napoleon as a person, not compared to most other biographies. And the social context which gave rise to Napoleon is not really explored here. I find the first two chapters of the book that deal with Napoleon's genealogy and his early years interesting and well-written. After that the book got too dense and the writing style rather pedestrian. Everything beyond the first chapter of the book is written for a specialist (a scholar who focuses on the 19th century or on military history). At the time of the publication the book received such glowing reviews that I cannot help but wonder what I missed here."
2,An Unclear Biography of Napoleon,"Napoleon is probably one of the most widely written about historical figures. There are many differing views about his intentions and ambitions. Markham takes a somewhat 'unclear' point of view when writting about the French Emperor. At times it seems like he is praising Napoleon for one thing or the other and at other times he is criticizing the ' Corsican Orge'. He laudes Napoleon's form of government as being advanced beyond its years yet he draws on unreliable memoirs which denounced Napoleon with impunity. 'Unreliable' memoirs are those which were written by those, between 1815 and 1830, who wished to regain Bourbon favour and be allowed back into prestigious positions. I feel that Markham doesn't give a very lucid explaination for the intervention in Spain or for that matter in Russia. Towards the end the picture drawn in this book becomes more nebulous, and we are given the choice between two uncompromising pictures of Napoleon."
3,It's ok.,Nothing special. It dragged on and on. Out of respect I watched the whole thing. I was more about the willpower of an older lesbian.
4,Orange Mound Representer,Chopper Girl's debut album on HooDoo Labs is a throwback to an older often times forgotten subgenre of Memphis rap.The album has dark overtones and rides a fine line between Horrorcore and Gangsta Rap. Touching on a variety of subjects Chopper Girl seems to show she isn't a one trick pony and this album has selections ranging from a high octane posse cut to dark and sinister tracks that are heavily influenced by vodou and all the way back to selections that will easily get people moving in the clubs and c-walking on the streets. A veritable whose who of Memphis artists make guest appearances both vocally and on the production side of the house. I highly recommend this for anyone who is a fan of Memphis underground.
4,Very good album,"This is definitely worth coppin. Got some bumpin tracks. It contains a variety of songs, she is NOT one of them artist where all tracks sound the same. 15 tracks, and at least 10 of them are worth bumpin all the time. She has a music video for ""Still Buck"" too. You can download it from her labels website. HoodooLabs.com"
5,Worth it for the Furs cover alone.,"Okay, a lot of this has been released elsewhere and some might find the price tag unjustified. However, this is worth it if for no other reason than the weird postmodern refraction (or something like that) of Robyn covering fellow '80s college rock casualties of the great alternative sellout of the 1990s, The Psychedelic Furs. ""The Ghost in You"" gains something in his sparse folk arrangement that it didn't have in its synth heavy/Richard Butler's limited vocal range but still great original version.Get it before it goes out of print like every other Hitchcock release.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
4,Nice unofficial comp,This is a bootleg and quite a number of the tracks have since been released as bonus tracks on the Rhino issues. But there's still a few choice nuggets that will delight the Hitchcock fan that one would be hard pressed to find anywhere else.
3,"Invisible History--Live ""The Ghost in You""","I got this just to get Robyn Hitchcock's live version of the Psychedlic Furs ""The Ghost in You."" A few other songs are worthwhile, but his version of TGIY is amazing."
2,shallow and unmoving,"The book was badly observed and shallow, with predictable and cliched plots. It made me want to throw up mostofthe time, and offered very little insight into the characters feelings. Do not read it unless you have to."
1,I could have spent my money better,This book did not move me at all. The plot is unrealistic and the characters are shallow; they do not seem like real people at all.
4,Excellent singles whichever ones you choose,"There are basically 3 singles out there to ownwhite cover UK single 1 (stellar is not actually acoustic like on the drive single)1. Are you in2. Are you in (oakenfold remix)3. Stellar (Acoustic)Are you in (video)red cover UK single 21. Are you in2. Wish you were here (live)pardon me (live video)australian release1. Are you in2. Are you in (oakenfold remix)3. Wish you were here (live)4. Warning (live)5. Stellar (live)Overall if you just want the tracks, get the aussie single, if you need the videos as well then get the 2 UK cds.as far as tracks go, all of them are very good, the live versions, especially warning are excellent quality. The remix of are you in is surprisingly awesome to the point you would think thats the way the song is meant to sound if hearing it the first time.Hope that is of help"
3,Better Than I thought,I purchased this book because my book club was reading it. It looked pretty lame at first. It turned out to have some useful information in it. It is a good resource item to have in your bookcase. I was originally going to take it to the used bookstore when the bookclub was done with it. I ended up keeping it for future reference.
3,A Handy Text,"I wish that I had had a copy of THE URBAN PRIMITIVE before I moved into my new apartment. I would have used some of the cleansing and blessing rituals included here. This is a useful book for Pagans from a variety of traditions; many of the suggested rituals can be adapted for particular paths. The authors also offer very practical advice for urbanites on a budget, such as seeking out goods at thrift shops and junk yards (after invoking the Goddess Skor, of course). A good gift for someone moving away or moving into a new area."
4,Urban Primitive Spiritualism,"This is long overdue. Most people get only so far along in the Modern Primitive scene without ""going native"". Here is a book that gives excellent and easily followed guidelines for anyone who wants more from their experiences as a Modern Primitve. Combining Piercings, Humor and Good Spirituality, this is a great buy."
3,"Good, but still some fluff around the edges","So your interested in Wicca but live in a city not the country, then you want this. One suggestion though: skip over the chapters on deities and ghosts, that's where the majority of fluff is found.An enjoyable read, if you can read it to get the most out of it and not just take the face value."
4,Satisfied Customer,"With the double vibes, this little dude has all the power you will ever need. The wife loves it! The only down side is the size. The ring is a little small, and not very flexible."
1,broken,I was not even able to use this item because it tore upon putting it together. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!
2,Didn't do much,Maybe my husband is bigger than normal but we had the hardest time getting this on. Once it was on we wanted it off pretty quick. The vibrations weren't very strong and one of the vibes was stuck in the on position so we had to remove batteries to turn it off. I didn't get any benefit from it and I don't think he got much.
4,Excellent writing!,"This book is a fabulous depiction of the Italian nun, Benedetta Carlini, whose drive for ambition in the Catholic church drove her to get the help of her lesbian lover to create the illusion of stigmata. Through this, she moves to new heights of power and respect in the church and brings money and fortune to the church...but upon accusations and scrutiny, she's brought down to pay for her ambition. The story is a tenderly told one. It has feminist elements and deals with the desperate desire of spoils, along with a not-so-pretty picture of the Church."
3,colour change,this eyeshadow is not the same colour as the one I bought in HollandThe first one is more mauve(purple and bluish)this new one is too purple{dissapointing) even though both are named Parfait amour
5,Excellent travel book,"I ordered this book after visiting the Amazon and Dr. Smith's clinic. The descriptions of her work there and her clinic, local people and their community, culture, climate, plant and animal life were spot on so it was a joy to read and added depth to my travel experience. Dr. Smith's medical dedication and adjustment to life on the Amazon is inspirational."
4,Trip to Amazon,This is a well written book that engages the reader in life on the river and the problems and innovative solutions the author achieved.I visited her clinic and it is wonderful the care the people can receive.
4,Amazon doctor tells all,"Linnea Smith's story captures you from the very beginning. Telling of her experiences as a physician in the Amazon jungle often keeps you on the edge of your seat. Taken directly from her journals, it discusses her experiences over a 7 year period of practicing medicine in the jungle without all the current medical technology. She also talks of the natives, their beliefs and some difficulties encountered because of the disparity of cultures. This book is an easy and enjoyable read."
3,Great Product but Lacks Some Enhanced Function,"I bought this scanner mainly for its enhanced data functionality. However, after activating the GM Enhanced Data I found out that it was still not able to display some of the enhanced data such as CAM Retard, which is what I needed to set the distributor on by GM Vehicle. The standard features worked good, fast communication between scanner and vehicle, and you can clear codes without having to shut the engine down (cheaper scanners force you to have the engine off to reset the fault codes). If SPX can get all of the enhanced data working on this scanner I would give it a 5. My best word of advice before you buy, search forums and call SPX tech support to verify the data you need is available on the scanner."
1,Not like I remember it,I bought this book 'cause I loved the movie when I was a kid. The book is really dry and a little hard to relate to. It's very English with lots of Moor descriptions.Couldn't finish it. Want it?
2,Four Star Music - get the other edition though,"Capitol's 1990 reissue of The Beach Boys' 1960s LPs gave us 2 of these albums on 1 CD at normal price. They're back for who knows how long - so get them while they're hot. On the 2-fer version of ""Little Deuce Coupe,"" which is in STEREO by the way and not MONO as it is here, you also get ""All Summer Long"" plus you get a nice stack of bonus tracks. Don't pass up this warning - and get the 2-fer instead - quick!"
1,Not what I was anticipating,Thought it was a picture book of the Fiords.... That's what happens sometimes when you cannot actually touch a book...
5,Unique and Captivating China,"High quality, light weight and uniquely interesting pattern. Adds fun to the dining experience and cleans up like a dream in the dishwasher. Arrived in absolutely perfect condition and was packaged exceptionally well."
4,nice print,a bit small then i would like but it was nice. Got it for my son's History class and it worked out great
5,Wonderful book...from ex-Hoosier,"I grew up in Indianapolis and really enjoyed reading about all of the things that have gone away since I was a little kid. I used to love Burger Chef, and the downtown Ayres store. I remember the Riverside Amusement Park sitting closed there for years when we would pass it going out to the Speedway.The author also has a webpage called ""Lost Indiana"" which talks about some of the Lost Indy topics, but also some other neat sites in the rest of the state. You could google this to find it."
4,"Great for mp3 phones, not so loud.","A great device, I use it with a NOKIA 9300 it is great.I use it during the gym, I can hear my songs and do not waste a call at all.Cons.: Low Volume, Not as loud as an ipod or mp3 playerPro: Very very confortable, great singal coverage.I you are looking for hearing your mp3 songs in your phone it is great. Watch out that it is not compatible to hear mp3 music from all MOtorola, I tried it with a V3i, and I only was able to use it as a regular bluetooth headset, I could not hear any music at all.I gurantee you your satisfaction."
3,IT WONT PAIR WITH MY IPOD IN MY IPHONE,IT PAIRED WTH MY IPHONE FINE AND IT WORKS REALLY WELL.BUT IT WILL NOT PAIR WITH THE IPOD IN MY IPHONE.
5,It's my favorite CD!!!!!!,"Wow! This is my favorite CD right now. Warning, if you liked Natalise's first album this one is a little different. And it's 20 times better! The music is totally hot and there are some killer beats and really great slow songs too. Her voice is amazing. And the lyrics are really meaningful. If you listen to the lyrics you can tell that she is talking about true life experiences and not just singing the same things as other other artists. And ALL the lyrics are printed in the booklet. It's a really big booklet with LOTS of pages TONS of photos and all the lyrics for every single song! The booklet is like a bonus. There are so many good songs on this album, It's the best CD I've bought in a couple years.I give it 6 out of 5 stars"
5,Guy Clark is the best,"Guy Clark continues to show what great country music really is. In these days of Shania Twain and the like where country is really a form of pop with cowboy hats, here comes Guy Clark with ""Cold Dog Soup"" that reminds you that great music with poetry in the likes of Hank Williams,Merle Haggard Willy Nelson and Townes Van Zandt still gets recorded. This is the true stuff that makes you think and tap your feet at the same time. This is an incredible production! Great work Guy! From Fort Worth Blues a Steve Earl Song to Red River, man you oughta be proud! This should be on the charts! But with the current country scene forget it.. Oh yeah what a great line "" Baby don't let um blow smoke up your dress...."" Also if you haven't written the song, you really know how to choose someone elses material and make it yours."
5,Simply Wonderful,"Being a fan of progressive rock, at first listen I didn't think much of this album because it didn't sound like there was much there. Don't make the same mistake! Don't be fooled by this album's simple sounds. They belie a complexity of story and emotion - an honesty that permeates every note on this album and is beautifully woven into a harmony of voice and guitar. This is a great album that is also well recorded - nuff said!"
2,A little too Lite,"Purchased these socks looking for the right balance of light construction and cushioning. I found only the light construction part. While they seem durable enough, the socks are way too light to provide an adequate barrier between my shoes and my feet. It's easy to earn a blister on anything more than a short run.These may be just right for someone who does not punish their feet with marathons and triathlons, but just not substantial enough for me."
3,they are not good,they are not up to the mark i can get them cheaper in china town with more quality any way its cheap
4,What a useful collection.,"It's good to have all Paine's material in one handy volume. Plenty to read and think about. It's a pity he's not better known in the USA, considering his significance in the existence of the country."
5,I feel like punching the Queen evertime I read his works,Brilianty written with passion and fury for the common men of this historic period of time. Essays written not for the elitests but for those who could and did make a difference. Paines works are truly historical and express the point of view of the common man who day after day is raped with taxes and control by a royal family thousands of miles away who could care less for the people they take claim to.His works helped give birth to the greatest nation to bless the Earth.
5,A Man of True Feelings For His Country. Not his Government.,"Paine was a patriot that believed that the country belonged to it's people, and it was up to the citizens to keep their democracy.He like the other founders knew that in order to be a truly free people they must rebel against th tyranny of England and set up a democracy where the people ruled it's government.A revoluntary, patriot whose readings is a must for anyone that is for keeping the government, of, by and for the people."
5,A Man of Reason,"At the height of The Age of Reason, The United States of America was created by men such as Thomas Paine and many others who held Man above all other philosophies long enough to get the idea ""Individual Rights"" down on paper in the form of The Constitution of the United States of America. Paine's contribution to this end is well known. Paine noted in this book that ""we have it in our power to make the world over again"", and they did. Man has a right to his own life, and there is no law above this. No one has a right to another man's life, not God, not the Race, not the dictatorship, not the proletariat, not The Great Society nor the New Deal. Thanks to Thomas Paine and men like him we have it in writing ""We own our own life and we are free to dispose of it in our own way"". Let's work together as free men and women to keep our freedom and to spread it around the world to our oppressed brothers and sisters. To the Glory of Man!!"
2,Does he even have an editor?,"I have no background in history and do not pretend to know what I'm talking about in that regard. However, when it comes to grammar, I know what I'm doing - and Howard Zinn, apparently, does not. The chapter of this book that I was given (Chapter 8: On Presidential Liars) was the most horrendously written piece of work I've ever read. Please make note of the fact that I read high school essays frequently; I thought I'd seen it all. Apparently, I was mistaken. According to Mr. Zinn, the American people have been ""deceived about"" much more than we thought, and should all ""deep anguish"" over it."
3,color issue,not lavender as labeled-this was more purple than lavenderThe color I was looking for was what I thought was a light purple
2,Taylor Made Gazebo,"When trying to install the products attachment brackets to the boat railing three of the eight screws supplied sheared off. When attempting to attach the cover over the frame, I discovered one of the velcro pieces sewn into the cover was coming unraveled. The center support pole that installs across the top and runs from front to back is supposed to have a pocket for the pole to fit into sewn into the cover at each end; mine only had one pocket making the center support useless. Got in touch with Taylor Made customer service to resolve the issue. They arranged for pick up of the defective product and said a new one would be sent right out to replace it....... over three weeks later and I still haven't received it. I think it will serve its purpose once I ever get the darn thing and it's not defective !"
5,Suspensefull & well Written,"Although this is an old public domain book, it was an entertaining, well written and exciting book. You may be able to get it free on other sites or get his package of 13 novels on this site that includes this book for .99"
2,Not his best effort,Max must have had a dictionary by his side while writing this bunch of hog wash. I read to be drawn into a story and it did not happen.
4,The Night Horeseman,"This book is written with a Victorian flair that may have been Max Brand's style. As this is the first work I've read from him (even at my age) I can't be sure. It was intriguing and written for the era. Brand was a popular writer of the time and has a strong command of the English language, which he uses to fully illustrate his characters. His descriptors however do tend to be lengthy and at times drag on for too long. Overall, a good read."
3,A different max,The book was long and drown out but a book to read as are most of 'macs books. A read for all.
3,the night horseman,Author is very wordy. Hard to understand at some times and takes pages to describe a very simple event.Finished it but wanted to quit several times.
3,Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance. Sorry I can't be of more help but it will,Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance. Sorry I can't be of more help but it will be a while before I do. The title caught my eye!
3,It's Max Brand,"I had forgotten that Max Brand has a lot of ""otherworld"" stuff in some of his books. He does write an entertaining tale."
5,super writer,"great reading. max brand has become one of my favotire authors. looking forward to reading more of his books,, great story teller."
1,Did not like at all.,I Just did not like the story line.Ii was not able to get into the story. Didn't even finish the book.
5,"One of their best yes, but definitely their most unique.","This is for sure many peoples favorite release from the band, and rightfully so, as it definitely is their most unique record in the catalog in my opinion. Epic and huge sounding, this is a classic album. Everything from killer cover art, to the lyrics... it actually transports you to the place you see on the cover of the album and makes you wonder; who is living in that cold and grim little ice castle that is sitting just on top of hell... or maybe that's just what icechests look like in Norway and they are camping and their campfire needs another log... Either way, this would be the album I would give to someone who has never heard or heard of the mighty IMMORTAL. Metalhead or not, You've never heard anything like this. IMMORTAL RULES!!!"
5,Not just for black metal fans,"This is a great cd by Immortal, even though I'm not a huge black metal fan. A+.My favorite song on this cd is Withstand The Fall Of Time."
5,A new fan of the almighty Sons Of Northern Darkness!,"The first music I heard from Immortal was the latest release ""Sons Of Northern Darkness"", and I was instantly hooked! I promptly picked up ""At The Heart Of Winter"", and, after hearing others in their catalog, regard this as their second greatest release. The music is varied and interesting to listen to (unlike Battles In The North...sorry guys!) with awesome riffs all over the place! It's been a while since I've been this excited about a band and am in awe of the power they incorporate into their playing. Although there are only 6 tracks, there is not a single bad song on here. You don't have to be a fan of so-called ""Black Metal"" (I'm not!) to love this album. I'm sure it will be one of my favorite CD's that I bought this year (and I buy a lot of music). Great artwork too! A must-have for the collection of any fan of real metal!"
3,Very Pretty Cake Dome Set - Excellent Price,Very pretty and well made cake dome set. Love the way it looks. The only thing that I don't like is that the dome it pretty heavy.
2,Beautiful but Misrepresented,"The Cake dome set was beautiful. I needed a 14 inch diameter plate because I was making a 12 inch cake. The lid had an 11 inch diameter so would not fit the cake. I was disappointed because when I search Amazon for the 14 inch cake plate; there were many unrelated products choices. It was very frustrating. Amazon, please only give unasked for alternatives. I know I am going to google search my product choices to find websites that only give me what I want!"
4,Unnecessarily Dense but Useful,"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story is a useful prep for using the software. It's an interesting and complete theory of story too, which is great. The book in general is well worth reading. My only problem is that if it's worth saying, it's worth saying WELL and this book uses twice the number of words it needs. The density of words also confuses the message. I felt, on more than one occasion, that the author was willfully complicating the message in order to ensure more sales of the software.Again, worth reading... valid and useful ideas... enough extra words that it undermines its own usefulness."
5,"""views of the man in the street ~ Joseph Hill""","This is one of the best Reggae albums to come out for a long time ""World Peace"", featuring Culture a mesmerizing preacher-teacher who tells it like it is. Heavy bass and drums, vibrating your whole being and getting through the fibers of life with every lyric.Several highlights ~ ""WORLD PEACE"", purity of harmonies reign within this simply but true statement ~ ""NO SEGREGATION"", hits home in every part of the world, no matter where you're standing at the time ~ ""SELECTION TRAIN"", again the lyrics blend with the beat, all you need is clean hands and pure in heart to climb aboard the Reggae train...sounds good to me.If Reggae is your cup of tea, then this one is a keeper. Take a bow Rounder Records for this enjoyable release, look forward to many more of the same...gotta love it!Total Time: 50:54 on 13 Tracks ~ Rounder 7764-2 ~ (6/17/2003)"
5,Garage Door replacement Circuit,Circuit Board arrived in quick fashion and in good shape. If you are just slightly mechanically inclined you can do this replacement yourself. Maybe the most difficult thing is working on a ladder. Had garage door working in less than 30 minutes.
1,Gross,"Ironside themes do not a great album make. Even worse are the puerile child singers - the themes are ghastly and the singing OMG!If you are high on crack this might be cool. Me, I love Archie's music from 62 to 70, this music is CRAP. Strangely, Things Have Go to Change was amazing - Archie you had it in you to be greatImpulse wanted a hit LP this was never going to be it!!!! Archie was misled or not up to say NO!!!!!!"
5,Wow! What a treat.,"I had no idea Dolly Parton was this GOOD. Really, seriously, this is top notch and I rate it 5 stars."
5,Help! I can't stop playng this CD!,"And I never thought I would go for bluegrass, always conjuring up images of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" in my mind. Leave it to Dolly to educate me. This music is extraordinary: very intricate all-stringed arrangements headed off by Parton's lovely, shimmering vocals. The lyrics are pretty much standard, straight-on country, but the singer is so heart-felt, she invests them with so many colors and nuances, she might as well be performing Shakespeare. Thanks, Dolly, for a truly GREAT CD!"
5,This is a stellar piece of music.,"Coming from someone whose musical preferences run the gamut, from Mariah Carey to Portishead to the Cardigans and back to Geri Haliwell, these words hold quite a bit of meaning. I had read reviews of the album which touted it as the ""best of her career"" and, of course, was skeptical. I can say with complete honesty that this Bluegrass was something I was unfamiliar with, but something I have come to greatly appreciate. The music is fresh and live, different from any mainstream pop we hear nowadays, and is well-deserving of a listen by anyone with an ear for music, whether they are a city boy (Bronx, NY here) or not. Good music has a way of transcending boundaries, and this is one of those discs."
4,Essential Dolly Parton,"Dolly has described this CD as her ""Blue Mountain"" CD. Part Bluegrass, part mountain music. This is as good as it gets. Dolly never fails to deliver and if you are a Dolly fan or a fan of good music in general, you will not be disappointed."
5,DOLLY IS STILL QUEEN OF COUNTRY MUSIC !,"DOLLY PARTON HAS SHOWN WITH THIS AMAZING ALL BLUEGRASS ALBUM, THE GRASS IS BLUE, WHY SHE CAN STILL CARRY THE TITLE OF QUEEN OF COUNTRY MUSIC. DOLLY IS NOT GETTING THE RADIO AIRPLAY THAT SHE STILL DESERVES. SO SHE LEFT COUNTRY MUSIC AND RELEASED AN ALL BLUEGRASS ALBUM THAT IS IN NO WAY DISAPPOINTING. I STRONGLY FEEL DOLLY WILL WIN A GRAMMY FOR THIS WORK OF PURE MOUNTAIN MUSIC ART. ALSO A WARM WELCOME TO THE RECENT HALL OF FAME MEMBER!"
4,Great Modern Bluegrass,"I'm a casual bluegrass fan and I really enjoy this album. Dolly's voice is perfectly suited for this style of music and the musicians she uses are obviously some of the best in the business.The only complaint I have is that, at only about 45 minutes, this album is too short. Dolly sings on every cut and I don't think it would have hurt to give this stellar band an instrumental number or two. If this album had two or three extra tracks (instrumental or otherwise) I would have given it five stars.""This album is too short"" could be considered a compliment and in this case that's partially what it is. Although I would liked to have gotten a little more quantity for my money, the quality of the music could not be better."
1,"Slick, over-produced bluegrass","I hate to disagree with so many people who love this CD, but I find very little to like about it. I found the ballads weepy, the upbeat songs cliched, and the singing/musicianship professional but uninspiring. To give you an idea of my tastes, my favorites are Nashville Bluegrass Band ""American Beauty"", Steve Earl/Del McCrory Band ""The Mountain"", Ricky Skaggs/Kentucky Thunder ""Bluegrass Rules"". In my opinion, ""The Grass is Blue"" does not approach the artistic standards of these and many other current CD's. Once again, no offense is intended to the many people who are so fond of this CD. The bottom line: I plan on making the day of somebody who wants to own this CD by selling my copy to a used CD store."
1,Band saves CD,"As usual, Dolly continues trying to sing but has no voice. The musicians are the only good thing about this recording. She's attempting to sing country songs Bluegrass style and it doesn't work."
1,"Only for the ""Waltons""","I love ya Dolly, but this music is the WHACK, or it is to this city boy! This is a Cd only the Waltons could love!"
4,Focus,"Since many music genres, among them the ""Latin American"" traditions from which Lhasa draws inspiration, use a limited aural palette and philosophy as a starting-point for individual compositions, I think it unfair to criticize Lhasa for her lyrical and aural restrictions. I would rather hear her and her band express themselves well using a limited repetoire than to barely-adequately play a dozen styles. That's called ""the eclectic approach"", and it's been far too hyped lately."
5,"She could be sister, friend or mother...","Lhasa's music:Her music crosses language/race boundaries. As a person who bond very strongly with female singers (eg. Kate Bush, Billie Holiday, Cesaria Evora), Lhasa's music speaks to me as if she is a close female friend, sister or mother.Amazing, intriguing voice. Simple yet dramatic; dramatic yet uncontrived.her velvet resonance and the beauty of the songs will slip unnotice past your defenses and touch the private self.I heard only about 30 seconds of the song ""de cara a la pared (Face to the Wall)"" on the show ""Due South"", but that was enough to make me determine to track down singer and song. I managed to do so on the net. And to my amazement, I found ""La Llorona"" in Singapore's HMV..."
5,bought this as a christmas gift for a friend,"I gave this cd to my friend for christmas & this is what she emailed to me: I've got my discman set up with the little speakers on my desk and I'm listening to Lhasa. I love that girl! Song 9 (playing now: ""Pajarol, tu me despertaste..."") reminds me a little of the Klezmatics--kind of that Eastern European gipsy feeling... Makes me want to get up, smash my coffee cup and start dancing, with the belly beads showing...."
5,I feel my skin with her voice.,"Lahasa, your music touches me in places which needed dusting. your gift reminds me i have a heart, skin, teeth, beauty. thank you. thank you. thank you."
4,Almost perfect CD,"The only reason I am giving this CD 4 stars instead of 5, is because it is too short! Lhasa's voice is sultry, sad and powerful. The music is haunting yet airy. Perfection!"
2,Too much noise for nothing?,"Reading the numerous exalting critiques of this new CD by Lhasa, I finally gave in and bought it... I have to admit, that the exoticism of the ""haunting"" style of interpretation can be captivating to the ones not familiar with the Mexican or Latin-American musical traditions. However, the various musical styles appropriated in this CD merit greater diversity in interpretation."
2,Not better than Chavela Vargas but certainly prettier,"After all these reviews, it is difficult to not feel like I would be doing an injustice ... yet, I think that those who claim to like Lhasa would much prefer the originality and talent of Chavela Vargas. Indeed, Lhasa's raspy voice is deeply influenced by the cigarrette-smoking Vargas. What is called haunting voice, or passion, by other reviewers, is a mode of interpretation that Lhasa administers indiscriminately to every song in her repertoire, especially when the CD includes merry Chrismas songs."
2,Frida's more attractive soundtrack sister,Utterly amazing and unique sound. Her voice is so powerful.
1,Disappointing,"One truly great song (the first on the disc) followed by 11 weird takes on Mexican folk music and depressing moans. The brilliant arrangement and accompaniment of the first song ""Mi Cara de Pared,"" a sexy, mournfully loping tango, led me to expect greatness within, but alas, Lhasa is a one-trick pony, one with a potentially great voice, which is reduced to strained yodelling on the subsequent uninteresting numbers. It's almost as if she were undecided what category she wanted to present herself in - is it world music? Latin? Pop? Rock? Unfortunately it seems to be none of the above. If I want Mexican folk songs, I'll call Linda Ronstadt. The arranger and producer (name forgotten) should have waited to present the CD when he had more tricks up his sleeve and the singer had better songs. A great disappointment - but that first number is a killer."
5,A fun-filled fantasy adventure,"""Castle"" is a wonderful book for children who have short attention spans. It provides adventure and re-affirms the laws of chivalry."
4,A Great Fantasy Book,This was a great fantasy book. I think it was good because it was full of action and imagination. It is especially good if you like knights and wizardry. This book was about a kid named William who goes on a spectacular adventure with a knight. He runs into trouble and has to defeat a wizard on the way. I recommend this book because it is fun to read and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
4,good for a young reader,"just got this book since i read it when i was younger and loved it. i will reread it one of these days, but i bet its pretty lame 15 years later, oh well."
2,Very Disappointed,"As a teacher, I've enjoyed using this book over the years in my reading program. Imagine my excitement when I learned that the book is on audio. Please understand, the book is worth ten stars, and I really love the story. It is very well written, the characters are fleshed out and believable. BUT... the audiobook is a great disappointment. It is read by the author with a full cast. Somebody forgot to tell Mrs. Phillips that she is from England, and, therefore, has a british accent. The woman reading her part sounded like she is from Iowa. Almost from the beginning I'm listening to audio and I'm going HUH!? This is what happens when you don't pay attention to your own production. I'm amazed that Winthrop allowed this lemon to get out, especially since she is reading on it. Go Figure!"
4,This Book RULES!....,"It is a very good book full of magic and castles,abou t a 11 year old gymnast that shrimks his self to save a magical toy's kingdom. A very good book for those who like the medival times."
5,Castle in the Attic,"Castle in the Attic is a masterpiece beyond childhood recognition. Ms. Winthrop has woven a tale not confined to the limits of a child's imagination, but one that tests the mature intellect. Christian parents will be pleased to discover that while magic is a recurring theme in this book, it proves to be mearly a side story to the more important and intreguing prospect of William's character development. I recomend to any parent this book for their young son. It speaks of Honor and Chivalry in the face of evil, of strength and tender souls. What this book speaks of in regard to emotional strength is something that every child, and even adult, needs to discover; That to Cry is not Cowardice, to be tender hearted is not Weakness, and that Honor and courage is the Heart of a Knight."
4,An incredible piece of work!,"This book, by Elizabeth Winthrop was one of the best books I've ever read. It was a real page turner! The end of every chapter left me wanting to read on. If you love fantasies too, I strongly recommend you pick up this one today!"
4,The Castle in the Attic,The Castle in the Attic was a great book. It was about a boy called William. His family friend babysitter was leaving. She gave him a castle. William and his toy knight go on an adventure for his babysitter. It was an awesome book. I would recommend The Castle in the Attic to everybody.
3,Castle in the attic reveiw,This book showed how sometimes imagination can make a really interesting reality. Being fiction and all we thought it was very interesting. It was very intriguing and we didn't want to put the book down. It was full of magic fantasy and challenges for the characters to face. This book is a good read-a-loud book great for class room discussions. We thought it was interesting how they described the forest when William was traveling to defeat Alastar. Two thumbs up!(...)
2,The Castle in the Attic,"i read the castle in the attic and i thoght it wasn't very entrtaning. but that's just my opinion. i thought on some of the chapters it dragged on and lost me alot. like it would talk about one thing and then another without alot of detail. for my opinion, it was an ok book. it had it's moments like whats going to happen next then it was really boring."
1,worst book in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life! I was forced to read it for school. It was complicated and very boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone!! Please don't waste your time and money to read this book!! Read something else!!
1,My review,The Castle in the Attic was about a 10 year old boy named William who lives with his mom and dad in Pennsylvannia. And he has a baby sitter that stays with him for 13 years and desides to go back to her home in England. William doesnt want her to go so he takes her picture of her husband who died in the world war 2. She finds out and is said for him and gives William a go away gift which was a huge toy castle with a led knight.
4,The Castle in the Attic,"Do you believe in dragons and magical lands? Well, if you do then this book is for you! Willam's house keeper is moving away. He doesn't want her to go.He tries to make her stay. Before she leaves she gives him a castle. Next thing he knows he's on a fantastic journey to free the land from a evil wizard. Will the wizzard catch him and turn him into lead. Read this book to find out. Recommended for 3rd graders and up.By Sam"
2,small,The shoes would have been awesome but..... the sizes run extremely small.I even ordered a size larger than normal thinking maybe this would happen.The shoes are still too small..
3,It's okay.,"I'm using it for track at school as a sprinter. It's okay, but to hold it together is a velcro strap. So you either use the laces or take them out and use only the velcro. Also, if you order them, order them a half size or a full size biggerthen your normal size or else it'll be a tight squeeze. Plus side, you can still run on your toes in them."
4,Bubble Gum Crisis,"This music CD went along fairly well with the action and theme seen in the show, Bubble Gum Crisis. I guess that kind of figures, as it's the sound track for the show, but it was very good. I'm not a music critic, but that is my opinion. If you were a fan of the show, this CD is a must-have."
3,"Nice Aesthetics, Poor Functionality Over Time","I bought this case about 3 years ago when I graduated with my M.Arch degree. I keep it in a small pocket inside my purse which is rather protected, and over time, it has deteriorated. The pin that is in the hinge constantly slips out and I have to push it back in, I find it difficult to open with such a small tab, and the clear cover (acrylic?) has cracked in several places. I find it quite awkward to hand out cards at a moment's notice because I have to turn it just right in order to get a good grip to open it. Nice idea, but I'll be sticking to something that lasts a bit longer and is easier and quicker to open. Let your business card tell people what you do - not your case."
4,Timely Delivery,"Sender made the transaction very smooth and pleasant. Delivery was on time as expected. The book, itself, was rather intriguing and very well written in details."
3,I really liked this book,"This book is great. I loved the way Blaise and Thea battled over Eric, though they should have given Blaise a soulmate too. I would like to know what happens to Thea and Eric after they go to live with his mom"
5,A very good book,"This is one of the many LJ Smith books I read and eventhough it is not the best, it was certainly very interesting... LJ Smith's books are very original and that's the main reason why I like reading them....I prefer all her other books about vampires though..since I'm a vampire freak..but I would encourage anyone to read this book...It's simply great!"
5,Best witch book i've ever read!!!,"Spellbinder was the 1st Night World book I have ever read.I recomended this book to ALL my friends,and I recomend it to you also. L.J. Smith is a very talented writer and I plan to read ALL of her books to come."
3,Spellbinder is...,"Well, let me just say that a lot of the reviews AND the back cover of the book are a teensy bit misleading. I mean they lead people to believe that Blaise is just bad and doing what she does out of spite which is NOT true and they also make the book sound cliche you know two dogs one bone, the horror! This book isn't like that, I mean it is good althought the male characters were a bit ah wimpy? Of course that's to be expected with two dynamic witches around. The plot could've used a teensy bit of work, but it's not like Smith didn't really know what she was talking about because it seems like she did (I have a friend who's into wicca and stuff). The two cousins are well developed characters and for the most part the connections between the characters are very well done. All in all I'd say this book is worth a read if you've got free time and nothing much else to do. Especially if you're into romance stuff, which I'm not... If I were I'd have probably given it another star."
5,Thanks for the info!!!,"I just wanted 2 say that I'm a real bookworm and I loved this book! I also want 2 thank L.J.Smith for putting in the book actual spells.(I'm a witch.) I've been looking for some of those like,forever"
5,"Magic, Love and Witchy Women........","This book is one of the greatest of the nightworld series. This book is about gentle, nature loving Thea and her wild beautiful cousin, Blaise.Thea falls in love with a human but since the rules of the nightworld state that she can't love a human Thea finds herself in a situation that could turn deadly......Blaise willing to do anything for her cousin tries to lure Eric into her trap and get him away from Thea for good!This has to be my favorite of the series. It was interesting to see the nightworld from the witches point of view and Thea and Blaise are great characters. Especially Blaise, she's no airhead beauty but like her name a bright blaze of passion, intelligence, and loyalty."
4,Spellbinder is Spellbinding!,"Unlike the first two books in the series Spellbinder switches it's romantic connections to witches insted of vampires. Blaise uses human men as toys till they go crazy, and when she sets her eyes on Eric, Thea's soulmate Thea will do anything to protect him, even if it means breaking the laws of the Night World. A great addition to the series that will have you excited to read more. Though it's a step down from Daughters of Darkness it stands well on it's own."
4,Pretty Good...,"The plot was okay, the characters were great, and the conclusion interesting. But it was not as good as other Night World Books. But still worth getting."
5,Great!,This book like all of L.J.Smith's other books is absolutely divine! I luved it. Blaise was a perfect witch in my opinion. The only thing that disturbed me was the awful torture chamber for Halloween in the Gym. How can people actually laugh about that (I've met people who think it's funny)?
3,Mediocre product,I ordered these with high hopes that they would do the job for me but it turned out not to be the case. The left hand drill bits did not seem very sharp at all and were not able to make any progress on the bolt which was stuck. The screw extractors were not close to the same level of quality of a standard Black and Decker one which could be bought at Home Depot.
4,Quality reverse drill bits & EZ Outs at a good price,"Good little set of reverse drill bits and corresponding EZ Outs. The #4 bit however, is a little short for the case, and if it is not closed properly, the bit will stick out of the case. This is how it was shipped, denting the case a little bit. The bit does not look damaged, but I have not used it yet."
5,Excellent! One of the best baseball books ever!,"Although most of the players from the 1961 Cincinnati Reds are forgotten now (exception: right fielder and National League MVP Frank Robinson), this book remains current due to the good humor and insider's view it affords the reader. Nearly 40 years old now, it shows how timeless the game of baseball is.I'm a lifelong NY Yankees fan, but this remains one of my favorite books on any subject.One note: this is one of the only baseball books that was _really_ written by the named author. Brosnan had no ghostwriter."
4,A very good follow-up to a baseball classic,"Jim Brosnan's second book is also a diary, this one on his 1961 season spent with the eventual National League champion Cincinnati Reds. Brosnan's wit, cynicism, and wry observations on the game of baseball make this an entertaining read. He enjoys interacting with his teammates (most of the time) and one conversation in particular involving Brosnan getting on a teammate for his grammar is priceless. It would have been nice had Brosnan included his spring training experience and the Reds' involvement in the World Series that year. Despite lacking those two elements, ""Pennant Race"" is an easy recommendation. It's not as good as ""The Long Season"", but it's still a very good read."
4,A Great Book for Baseball fans,"This is a very entertaining book that will appeal to all baseball and/or Cincinnati Reds fans. It's a day to day diary of events in Cincinnati's 1961 pennant winning season prepared by relief pitcher Jim Brosnan. It's easy to read, and you'll enjoy Brosnan's humor. Additionally, it gives great insight into the personalities of the star and every day players of the time."
3,"NOT TOO BAD, SOME IMPROVEMENT NEEDED!","NOT TOO BAD! THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS ITEM IS, WHILE VACUUMING, SHOULD ONE'S THUMB TOUCH THE SWITCH (even barely), THE VACUUM SWITCHES OFF; this could be annoying."
2,too thin to hold weight,this product is good for child I guess..cause it is a little thin...but it is better than the one I saw on sports authority which is thiner
1,"This is NOT a VHS tape, It's a music CD.","This was sent to me by mistake. So free it was but not a bargain.I dislike this imported 2 disc, 40 tract album very much. The is from the 30's I would think. With high quality headphones this stuff is to hard to listen too.The sound is very thin and hissy. Fidelity is low and overall listen-ability is very weak. This big band stuff without the big band sound. Song after song, it all sound the same, very boring material with sound to match. Just a throw-away."
2,STOP. We waited 8 months for THIS ?,"I was so looking forward to Tomb Raider: AOD coming out in November 15th 2002. Then it got delayed, then delayed again, and again, and again, and again. When it finally came out (8 MONTHS LATER) I was really excited. I put the game in my PS2. And was really shocked at how bad this game was. I was expecting something incredible. But no. Lara moves like a robot, it is very difficult to control her, loads of bugs and its boring. No fun. I am a huge Tomb Raider fan and have played them all. But I think this one might be making a trip back to the shop for a refund. However, the graphics are incredible (best i've seen in any game), lara looks amazing and the music is great. But overall I am very dissapointed. EIDOS, get it right next time."
4,"Okay, so its not like the old TR games...","but that doesn't mean it's not good. I mean, the game, like a lot of things in life, must evolutionized some times or other. And Tomb Raider is doing exactly that. So it is different. Lara also no longer runs, but walks for the most part. So what? I think it's a nice change. Sure it will take some time to get used to the changes, but it isn't bad. And for all the people who are complaining about how slow the game is, you know what? You need to get newer computers. Just because your computer fulfills the minimum requirement needs doens't mean it will be good. I have a fairly new computer and it runs perfectly."
2,Maybe next time...,"I, like a lot of people writing reviews, play a lot of first person shooters. If you liked Splinter Cell, buy TRAOD USED!!! I agree with everyone here...story is good, controls are less than mediocre. Even Enter the Matrix blew this game away. Customizing the keyboard helps some, but less than what I expected. I tried to leave feedback for EIDOS, but to no avail. Hopefully, if there is another one it will be in beta for a lot longer. And for those of you out there who think that it might be my pc, I can assure you that is NOT the case."
1,waste of money!!!!!,"Oh man, this is horrible! I'm a Lara junkie, and I'm completely embarassed by this horrid game. The PC controls are a joke, you just seem to spin in circles when you're just trying to make a simple turn. I feel completely ripped off by the folks at Eidos for releasing such a bug filled game. Game locks up at the worst possible moments, cut screnes are too long and dull, just let us play the game without the need to watch a movie every level...put all that energy into fixing the movement controls and lock up issues. Please, don't waste your hard earned cash on this!!! Maybe Eidos will get the message."
2,"Should have waited to release, rather than sacrifice quality","This is, by far, the most bug filled game I have ever played. The new control system is extremely clumsy and will leave Lara die-hards wondering what the developers were thinking when they decided to revamp the old one. I hate to say it, but I think EIDOS was more concerned about not missing another promised release date and sent out an unfinished product; the obvious quality issues are apparent in the first chapter and get progressively worse. I would not be surprised if the company has to issue a recall for this defective product. On a positve note, the improved graphics are beautiful, but are hard to appreciate because of the frustrating gameplay."
2,Absolutely awful controls! DO NOT BUY,"I am a huge fan of the Tomb Raider series, and have played all five other games on my PC. I love them. I was so excited to get this one, and sooooo disappointed with the quality. Glitchy glitchy glitchy. Do not buy this game. The controls are terrible. While all other 5 games play out smoothly, this one is slow, stalls, goes blank some times, and takes minutes to load to new chapters. Now I don't have a fancy schmancy computer, but I have been able to play all the other games on it just fine without any hitch. This is just crap. It makes me feel like I have to go buy a $2000 computer just to be able to play this $30 game! It probably runs better on a PS 2, so if you have one of those don't bother with the PC version. Thanks a lot Eidos, I totally wasted time and money and am warning future buyers to BEWARE!"
1,Robocop dressed like Lara Croft,"I was expecting Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness since last year, with a similar performance as Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, but now when I receive the game, I saw this little girl that walks like with an umbrella inside of her pants.The graphics and sound are great, but Lara rotates like a robot and when I try to make her run, she doesn't agree with me and moves extremely slowly.I have a 2MHz PC with 500Megas RAM and GeForce4 Graphic Card, and there is no possibility that only this game needs to practice Ctrl-Alt-Del each 15 minutes in order to play it.I'll find the way to sell my game and suggest Eidos to make a research in order to define how many of the customers are really satisfied with this game and determine if a refund to the customers is the better way to maintain the good image of Eidos until today.It's a shame."
1,Do Not Buy This Game,Inspite of the two patches offered by Eidos the game crashed very often. Lara's movements are hard to control and choppy in stairwells. You will be nothing but disappointed if you spend your hard earned money on this game.
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this game at a reduced price and still feel like I got ripped off. The controls in the PC version are an absolute nightmare and make what could have otherwise been a decent game horrible. Sometimes you feel like you have no control whatsoever. Good thing two successful movies have been made about this game otherwise EIDOS would've been out of business with this horrendous offering. In fact I'll think twice before purchasing anything with the EIDOS name or CORE DESIGN name attached to it.
1,This [stinks],"I will have to assume this game is going [to stink] Why would it's release be pushed back a third time? I am tired of waiting. This game must be so bad that Eidos/Core must feel it needs some severe refinement before release.On top of the release date changes, neither Eidos or Core have bothered to put the news up on thier sites. ..."
3,old tomb raider new game,first off dont get me wrong i love this game but in most of the tomb raider games you get two pistols with infinite ammo you never get those guns in AOD that is the first thing the controls are way different than any other TR game and for two or three levels you play as a guy that really set me off the great thing about other TR games is its not like every othor steriotypical video game you play as a girl thats cool well i think if your gonna buy a TR game buy a game thats like 75 cents and is a classic iinstead of a $30$ game that is gonna ruin the series
1,"Bad Eidos, Bad!","Oh. My. God. I remember when Tomb Raider first came out, and my husband and I got it on the original PlayStation. It was great, for 1995. We got Angel of Darkness for our computer, and WHOA! It looked like Eidos had REGRESSED! The animation is choppy, jumps (basically all moves, in general) are hard to control and judge, and I read on a review for the PS2 version that you'd better come to love the phrases ""save successful"" and ""load successful"" because that's what you'll do, over and over and over! It's completely ridiculous how bad the game looks and plays. Holy cow, and the Glitches! At one point in the church, if you move Lara to JUST the wrong spot then the game gets stuck on the two boxers in the ring fighting, and you have to reboot the computer to get out of it! This game wasn't even worth the discounted price I picked it up for. Don't buy it, it's a trick..."
4,"Worth the wait, minus some glitches.","Not as explosive as the earlier titles but this game keeps you wanting more. The graphics are above avg. and the camera mostly does what it should. The sound draws you into the game like before, hearing things coming and looking away from the tv as if they were in your house. There are a few glitches when you read some of the many clues, under the Louvre I had something that repeated for what seemed like forever. I just made it to Prague and can't wait to get off work to play again. Fans will still have the puzzles and mazes that take hours to clear a room. This isn't a shooter though, Lara fights but not often, at least not early in the game. Alot of hidden places that you don't have to go to to complete the game, not little rooms with a medi-pac but large rooms with ajoining rooms. Just buy it, if you have a month or so to invest into being in front of your tv on the edge of your seat."
4,"Lara croft, angel of darkness","The graphics on this game are really really good.A big downer is the controls, it used to be really easy but now you`ve got no choice but to use the anolog buttons and i hate them!The locations are very detailed and the interaction of friends and enemies is very impressive.But, i`m not sure that it was a good idea to bring in another character.overall, a very good game worth the money, v.good graphics and locations. The only set backs to this game are the controls, and the extra character."
1,Angel of darkness is correct,This game is the angel of darkness - THe control system is impossible - The menu screens are ridiculous and bulky to manage - I have played all the tomb raider games - This one is near to unplayable - This thing went straight to EBAY - save your money for something good - THE TR people need to do something fresh with this character like send her to space or something - jeez - the franchise is getting old and stale due to lack of innovation and change.
2,One would think.........,"Hmmmm, as a veteran of Tomb raider and an someone who plays most of the 1st person shooters that appear I was quite disappointed in the game controls. The story is great, the graphics are much better then previous Tomb Raider releases but the controls ruined the game for me. One would think with all the 1st person shooters with very precise and smooth controls Tomb Raider would have them too, not so. It is very frustrating to try and play a very well done story only to continually die for lack of the ability to accurately control Lara's movement. I hope Edios learns from this experience."
3,Not what I was expecting!,"OK, just got the game last week, and I was soooo excited, but started to play, and was a little disappointed when I found her so hard to control. And what is with the slow motion? Every once in a while it looks like instant replay during your game play, either this, or Laura is severely tired and has to slow down. What's the deal? Also, the camera angles are a little difficult to get used to, I am still adjusting. The graphics are great, but I think a little more work should have been done on the controls; she is just too difficult to move sometimes. Jumping is not the same anymore, and why must she walk before she starts to run? Before it was straight out running, and now, she has to take about 3 or 4 steps before she starts running. I am still hanging in there; I believe it must get better. I am still playing, so I guess I will just have to adjust to the ""new and supposedly improved"" Laura."
1,Come on here people...,This control sceme made Tomb Raider 1 unplayable. This control scheme kept me from passing the TRAINING levels of TR: Last Revelations. This control scheme was horrible but barely useable when I played Resident Evil. This control scheme caused me to die like a thousand times on the first level when I played Fear Effect. This control scheme is still compleyely horrible in this game.Would someone please tell Eidos to change the controls in any future Tomb Raider games. I really want to like this series but every one of these games has been unplayable due to the control scheme.
4,Exceeds expectations,This is my 3rd pressure washer and by far the best of the breed. It is solid piece of work that is easy to move about when doing the deck(s)with wheels that actually work. Santa gave me the one with the roll-up hose which is very nice feature. Only problem was that the User guide didn't have any information on this feature so I spent a few minutes trying to figure out where or how to connect the high pressure hose to unit- Guess What? - No need to connect anything except garden hose. I consider this tool the best buy for your $$$$
4,My new electric power washer,McCulloch 1800 PSI Electric Pressure Washer #FHH18AHave used the washer a couple of times and found it easy to operate. It has done the jobs I purchased for a snap. For the time being I find the product of good quality. It appears sturdy & I have the impression it will be a long time before I need another jet washer.The vendor shipped promptly.NGA
4,Gets the job done,"It does an excellent job on mildewed wood such as decks and deck furniture without using chemical mode which is the only weak link in an otherwise strong chain. Unfortunately, the only effective chemical solution is chlorine which acts more or less on its own but cannot be used with this machine. Safe cleaners, such as Simple Green are no more effective than when used without them. Other than that, it's a great product."
1,Do not buy this Brand!!!,"I was originally pleased with the make of the washer but the connector between the washer and hose broke, when i ordered the replacement parts it took them over 1 ""YEAR"" to get the replacement parts to me. That is not a typo and i find it ignorant that it took that long to replace a plastic part that they should have had mass produced with plenty of spares. Do not buy, the customer service is horrible and the machine breaks easily, not to mention to get it fixed takes a year."
2,"Cheap Plastic Parts, Poor Quality","This machine does a decent job of cleaning when it works, but it breaks way to easily for the price, and its not built well enough to justify fixing. Too many cheap plastic parts. Consider it to be disposable if you buy it."
2,Worked at first,"When we got this product it worked great. After a year though, the pressure is next to non-existent and I cannot find a troubleshoot guide to find out what the problem is, or how to fix it. I consider myself very handy and can usually figure these things out, but this one has me stumped. It acts like there is air getting into the system and the result has been damage to the motor or something.The company is absolutely no help at all in advice for fixing this machine.Sorry, but I cannot recommend it as highly as those who are doing so."
3,Small washer for small jobs,"Bought new @ Menards, used several times to clean screened in room floor, garage floor, wash car & truck. Works good on small jobs. Biggest complaint: the cheap plastic hose connector broke shortly after using & sounds like a common problem many have had. Checked online for replacement part @ $1.39 but shipping costs more than the part! Think I'll check my local hardware store for a universal hose connector if there is such a thing. Too bad a cheap broken part makes the washer totally unusable."
4,McCulloch 1800 PSI power washer,"Super easy to set up and use. Lots of water pressure, tons of hose, and an extra long electrical cord. It also wheels around nicely. I'm excited to use the attachments."
4,McCulloch 1800 PSI Electric Pressure Washer,"I like it. I live on the west side of the Cascade Range in Oregon and things get dingy pretty quick. I had my vehicle, the rain gutters on the house, landscaping bricks along the path around the house, and odds and ends all washed in about an hour. It works great. The only drawback that I can find is that it doesn't appear to suck up any cleaning solution in the high pressure mode. Only the low pressure. I haven't tried the upper tank yet so maybe that's the problem. Not a huge issue since plain water pretty much takes everything off anyway. The plastic double male hose attachment was a concern before I purchased the unit. I'd read that most of them broke pretty quick. As long as you are aware not to stress it out dragging it around, it will probably last a good long time. If it does break it should be easy to replace pretty cheap. Again great unit so far."
1,failed after 2nd application,"i never got this to work, it shorted out and is made out of cheap plastic. didn't come with all the attachments would not recommend this product"
5,Great series,"I have several titles in this series--they're great! The recipes are easy to make and clearly set out, and there is always an introductory chapter on the herb or spice covered by the book. There are several other titles in this series: coriander, ginger, garlic, chocolate, etc."
2,"Great Work, Poorly Organized Kindle Book","This review is intended as a review of the book, not of the work of Edgar Allan Poe. As a Poe fan, I purchased this book just for the pure fun of reading Poe on my Kindle. However, the book is so poorly organized that finding a particular tale or poem is a real pain and takes a lot of the fun out of it. While there is a table of contents, the individual works are not list there; rather there are groupings of the works so you have to know (or guess) to which group the work you may be looking for belongs. Alas, there is also no index. This is an electronic book: I should be able to toggle down a table of contents to a particular work, select it, and be taken there, but it doesn't happen that way. Not recommended for Kindle readers!"
5,Always a great book...,All I can say is that this is a nice nearly complete compilation of his work. A must read in my educated opinion.
3,Insect,This didn't cover as many inseck pictures as I thought it would. Was a gift for great grandson and I thought it would show pictures of more insects than it did.
5,Good primer.,"Great book for an overall look at insects. Doesn't go into great depth on any one topic or insect, but provides a great cross section of information. Purchased this for my son and will admit that as usual, the DK illustrations caught my eye and I ended up reading the book too. This is a great series of books for kids that really captures their attention."
5,Excellent Educationl Text,"I'm a teacher and I find the Eyewitness books highly educational. I like the way the concepts are presented in a form without backgrounds. This gives clear facts to the reader without over taxing the attention span. The books are highly informative, presenting difficult concepts in comprehendable chunks that stimulate interest. I have almost the whole collection for my own children and they LOVE them!"
4,Wonderful!,"A wonderful book, beautifully done, which never fails to fascinate children.For such a short book it's surprisingly complete. Perhaps most importantly of all, it encourages children to look for further information, and directs them to good sources (including the bugs in their own backyards!). The inexpensive used copies that are available make this a don't-miss."
4,Philosophic Classics,"There is a huge range of authors in this book, and it includes most of the main ideas from each original passage. It can be sort of hard to follow at times, however, as it leaves out giant parts of arguments, especially in The Republic. This really breaks down the flow of the piece and renders it much more confusing than the original book."
5,REMASTER 2012! GOTTA HAVE IT!,"So, what I've always wanted was a clean digitally remastered version of ""Pom Pom Play Girl"" in MONO! The stereo is rechanneled with Carl singing on one channel and the guys singing on the other! The Mono ""FUN, Fun, Fun is also a ""Must Have"" in Mono to get the full benefit of Brian's Vocal. The music and vocals are very clean on this CD. The gatefold packaging is a bit weak without any details on the songs but still an overwhelming experience for anyone who enjoys surf music."
2,You can skip this one,"This is not one of Daignault's better books, it reads like some poorly written nostalgic ego trip, with way too many paragraphs about beating out the regulations on beach buggy laws and surf casting that were put in place in the Cape in the 1970s. The title does certainly does not belie its contents: you indeed feel like it's been 20 years of Daignault on the Cape by the time you're finished reading it."
5,Fantastic Melting Pot of Music,"Having seen Scruj live a couple of times, and owning a copy of their studio release CD (see their website), I would consider myself a major fan. To quote a friend, ""Are they French, Irish, or American Country?"" Good question. Answer: all of the above.Blending Irish folk music, french fiddles and lyrics, and country twang, Scruj manages to always be true to the styles they worship. Yet they are all so young! If you have not seen them or heard them, do yourself a favor and do whatever it takes! They play such wonderful music with a profound respect for it's origins and it's spirit."
5,Great in different styles !!!,"The reason that i give this cd 5 stars... it's simple... different styles of house music, compiled on one cd... you will enjoy it a whole time... so it's worth for your money !!!If Jack keeps it in this way... we may expect beautiful things of him in the future !!!"
3,Worth watching...,"...okay first of all it is supposed to be a vampire movie, but the vampires act more like zombies. They bite the hell out of any and all bodyparts, they walk like they're zombies, and act like they are zombies. This movie was not bad, except they over did it with the blood. Too much of it is not always a good thing, and it gets old after a while. I would say this is about a three and a half star movie. It is a good addition to your horror library, but not an integral one. I would say rent it first, then if you feel it justifies a purchase then by all means. I don't regret I got it, but I wish I could tell you it is a must have."
2,Guess i missed what was cool,"I bought this thinking that it was going to be one of those major life-changing experience moments in horror or something. As i said in my title... I guess i missed what was cool. It was ok for a low budget, but even then i guess i just didn't like the story, concept or style of the movie at all. People running down an alley flailing their arms does not invoke terror to me... sorry. So i suppose this movie ranks as a: Either you hate it or Love it kinda thing. Watch a trailer, if you like what you see go for it."
1,"""HOME MADE"", Lowest Budget Film...","********* W A R N I N G ! ************* STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE! ****This movie is pretty bad! Ultra low budget movie with terrible acting and a boring plot, which combined with a huge stuggle to stay and watch should have given this one a NEGATIVE FIVE STAR RATING!!!MONEY DOWN THE TUBES WITH THIS ONE!!!"
5,Excellent quality,"Wonderful product - heavy weight and well made. This has been a delightful and useful addition to my 50's style, diner kitchen."
3,what's about English tradition of jewish music,Very interesting items sung by the beautifull Moshe Hachel's voice.I regret the quality of choirs work.The compositions for choirs are very modern and don't seem to be matching a sacred service requirements.The only reason why I would buy this CD is the Moshe Hachel's performance which is wonderfull and outstanding.
2,"Good support, but expensive and not durable!","I tried these Jobst 15-20 mmHg pantyhose in my search for high quality therapeutic support pantyhose for a severe circulation problem in one of my legs. I did find them a little difficult to put on, but once they were on they stayed in place nicely and provided great support.The only problem I had was, like the other review stated...they ran the second time I wore them. For as expensive as these pantyhose are, they should last longer than 2 wearings.They are not too sheer, if that is something you are looking for in support hose. They look more like tights when they are on your legs. I did find the beige shade to be a little more like a pale nude shade."
4,Good,muy buen producto. rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega. sin contratiempos en todo el proceso. lo recomiendo a a
2,Also ran the first time I wore them,"I put them on at the doctor's office and the first time I had to take them off, sure enough, ran them. Otherwise, liked them very much."
4,Interesting performance,"I bought this only because as a fan, I want all of their material. First off, you'll notice the disc length of 76.46. The band added a keyboard player Graham Maitland for this tour which at first is a bit hard to digest(mixed too far up front)sometimes the keyboards work, other times not. There are some classics here- 'The king will come', 'Persephone', 'Time Was' as well as a few others. Sound quality is average, sounds like a straight transfer with no doctoring with the sound. This is the Mark 2 lineup with Laurie Wisefield. Not one of the best concert offerings by the band but worthwhile. I'm sure the band has some real gems in their archive like the live tracks on the superb 'Distillation' box set. Sadly they are not contained on this disc. If you can get past the keyboards and the muddy sound quality, you may enjoy it. Somehow I feel only the true fans will want this disc in their collection."
2,Danger.....,"Watch out for this turkey! Definitely a disk for the true believers only. Sound quality as bad as any bootleg I have ever listened to, some songs fade (on a live album!?) and skimpy liner notes add up to a pretty bad package. And the addition of a keyboard player seems to hurt rather than add to WA's sound. If you are dying for a live disk from WA's ""Locked In"" tour, this will have to do. Otherwise, save your money."
5,Real cultured butter of high quality,"I usually buy the salted version of this butter since I mostly use it for spreading and for that I like the flavor of the salted version better. That being said, there are a number of recipies that call for unsalted butter and then the unsalted Lurpak is as good as you will find.Note that Lurpak is cultured butter (not sweet cream butter like most American brands) and as such it has a deep and rich flavor that no simple sweet cream butter can match. Cultured butter of this kind is produced by fermenting the cream with lactic bacteria that convert sugars to lactic acid before churning the cream into butter.In my opinion, the Lurpak Danish butter holds its own in comparison with far more expensive butters. I actually prefer Lurpak over brands like Echire, etc."
4,"A pleasant travelogue, slightly dated but that's ok",Ejoyable stories from the early 1980's by an author who waxes a bit nostalgic for the British Empire. Well written with dry humor. A languid pace. Never dull.
3,Kind of Annoying,"I can live with the chapters that are outdated; I mean, Winchester wrote this two decades ago, the 'first published' date tells you this. I see no need for him to have to update anything. It's a travel book from the early 1980's.What did annoy me though was Winchester's constant and, one must assume, deliberate ploy of interchanging the words English/ England with British/ Britain, as if they meant the same thing.Whether Winchester liked it or not (and I'm sure he probably didn't) the Empire was British; England may well have been in control but the constant interchange often found in the same paragraph is a real kick in the teeth to the hundreds and thousands of Welsh and Scots that helped form the fledgling Empire.The book cover has the Union Flag on it. It's there for a reason."
3,Too outdated to matter,"Darn - what are these places like today - not 30 years back? Turks &Caicos are now bustling - Bermuda is large off shore banking capital, and Monserrat is no more. Hong Kong is transformed into China."
3,"Lacking in content, but some inspiring photos.","As an experienced bookmaker, I was anxious to try some of the projects in this book. BE VERY CAUTIOUS! I found many errors in measurments in this book, which can cost you valuable paper and time! This book can be very vague about what size your papers should be and exactly how much of it you need. If you simply rely on what the author says, you may find yourself frustrated with a project that didn't work out.Other than that, there are some nice inspirational pictures in the book, but I don't know if that justifies the purchase. So, unless you're prepared to do some serious math/measurment checking, I'd go with a book that the editors actually took time to edit."
1,WARNING - Does Not Help,"This is one of those books that copies all of the information from other books and tries to call it their own (an does not give all the information needed to do the few examples). If need information on bookbinding, the best I have found is Hand Bookbinding: A Manual Of Instruction by Aldren Watson (also available here)."
2,A disappointing and frustrating read,"I was eager to read this book because it's set in a part of the world (upstate NY) where I spend a lot of time and it exactly the kind of neo-Gothic tale I usually love. She has talent, it's undeniable, but Scott is far too enchanted with her own writing to tell a decent story. Every time I found myself beginning to be captivated by the narrative or the chatacters, I'd stumble across a highly polished, self-conscious set-piece of prose that screamed ""HEY! Look at me...don't I write well?!"" After a second attempt to finish this book I am giving up on it and moving on."
2,"Good, but only to the midway point","This is a wonderful Victorian-style novel about a manor house, its mistress, and her domestics. Wonderful that is, until the middle of the story. The author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story. It's spooky and interesting, but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrator's point of view, time, and setting make the rest of a great read a downer."
2,Victorian???Hardly!,To call this a collection of Victorian erotica is inaccurate as this implies that all the stories are from that era. I felt rather cheated to realise that a few were obviously twentieth century additions. It might have been more accurate to have titled this a Collection of 18th -20th Century Erotica
3,Victorian Directory,"This book is essentially a directory of Victorian erotica, recapping highlights of each major effort (of which there are many). Should the reader be expecting something else, he or she will almost certainly be disappointed."
2,Truncated,"It would have been nice if the editor included a bibliography, so people could read an entire novel. For example, The ""Romance of Lust"" selection doesn't do its author justice. The original is a big book, wherein the author couldn't possibly have held a job anywhere since he devoted his entire day to erotic diversions. No one was safe, not even his aunt and sisters. Well, maybe the family dog. Other selections were uninteresting too. Is the editor really a Major? Why do we need his military rank in such a book? Is he still in active duty???"
1,Waste of money,This looked like it would be lots of fun but it's very hard and uncomfortable and doesnt vibrate very well at all. Dont waste your money
1,Just in case anyone is as stupid as I am,"This may be the best product out there ... I wouldn't know because I had no idea what I was ordering. It didn't dawn on me when it said pneumatic that I had to have an ""air supply"" ... plus it doesn't have any grinding points. I just wanted something to etch my name on the metal prints of my artwork. So back it goes and I'll look for something that's simple enough for me to understand what it is and how to use it."
4,DON'T go to ebay. Nothing except bootlegs and crooks.,"It costs a lot because its an IMPORT, not a bootleg! If you're going to enjoy the CD, might as well enjoy it knowing that you didn't pay too much money for a crook to burn the CD for you. Honestly. Things cost money. To a real fan, this is worth the money. Costs a crook a penny to create a mediocre bootleg. Do you really think you're saving money?"
3,Go to ebay,You can get all 4 cd's on ebay for about the price your paying for this. If you like the series and the music that goes with it buy it in ebay. If u have cash to throw away then buy it here
1,I am not impressed with this product!,"I bought this bag holder to use in my yard to collect leaves anddog droppings. The construction is very flimsy and the little tabs that hold the bag in place are VERY VERY hard to get off!. After several months, it now can barely stand up by itself and I have to constantly tighten the wheels and other screws. It would be nice if it was better made and sturdier and if it had a cover to keep out the flies...It seemed like a great idea, but the products is not well made."
1,Cheaply made product,"I often struggle when trying to empty the clippings from my lawnmower into a garbage bag and I had hoped that this product would make that task easier. I was disappointed, I must say. The frame is very thin and unstable. The assembly instructions were hard to understand and the product was hard to assemble with only one set of hands. I am not pleased with this product at all. It seems as though it would collapse if I were to use it for my intended purpose. I do not recommend this product at all."
2,Flimsy Bag Holder,"The product seemed like a good idea but wish I had read all of the reviews before ordering. The product is not sturdy at all. It didn't come with the number of screws noted on the instructions so I had to go out and purchase more in order to finish putting it together. That was after I spent way to much time trying to decipher the instructions. Also, the clips that hold the bag to the frame are very tight and very difficult to put on and remove. I've torn every bag I've used. I hate wasting my money; but, I'll have to buy a better one."
1,flimsy,"poor instructions, had to modify by creating new holes in the metal. The rubber bag clamps were too difucult to remove so replaced with wood clothespins. Don't bother with this thing."
1,mismached,The item as pictured was not sent. Instead a holder was sent that had no provision to hold the leaf bag nor did it have wheels. Not worth the ;money
1,BUYER BEWARE,This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time. It didn't even make it through one bag of leaves. I would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back. Can't believe Amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department. Take my advice and save your money!!!!!I would have given it no stars but didn't have that option. In my opinion it rates 00000 stars....
3,Rolling Leaf bag holder,"It does the job fine but it is flimsy and will only stand up to light duty. Additionally the screws are constantly loosening up and require retightening.James in Palm Springs, CAGet Organized Rolling Leaf Bag Holder"
1,don't waste your money,The worst item I have ever purchased it is so flimsy you can only fill it to half full putting it together nut and screws stripped out and had to go to ace hardware to buy new bolts and nuts save your money
4,"The other side of ""A brave new world ""","This science fiction novel walks around the speculative situation about a natural (not social and not even political choice) population distribution, in agreement his skills and gifts.Naturally many facts occur in this interesting tale , but the most remarkable issue is to make us think the elusive dreams about a better and even pacific society."
3,Raises Some Good Questions,"First of all, like any utopian vision, this book lacks life. Though I think that psychedelics (entheogens) can help some people to get in touch with a larger reality, I dont think that this holds true for everyone. For instance, personal transformation and inner-conflicts were treated simplistically. I did think the dynamic between the peaceloving people of Pala and its internal greedy members as well as outsiders who wished to exploit the island rang true. Would like to give this book a better review, but I can't.Thomas Seay"
3,Utopia?,"Although it was his last book, I wasn't that impressed. Half the characters were depressing/vulnerable and didn't have much going on. Huxley's ideas and philosophy were in place but it just didn't mesh for me. His earlier works much better."
5,The Distillationof Huxley's Views on Life and Death,"One of my all time favorite books, glad to have a new copy"
3,The Survival Book,I think this book was adventerous and scary. It wasn't the best book I've ever read but it was pretty good though. My favorite part was when they fell off the ship. The bad part was that they couldn't fine each other.
2,NOT VERY GOOD.....,"I decided to read ""Island"" because i enjoyed ""Brave New World"" so much. Well the former is really horrible compared to the latter. It's pretty boring, the plot doesn't make much sense and the main character's ideas are often all over the place.While certain parts of this story are interesting, in it's entirety, i would have to give it two thumbs down :("
1,I would rather chew my leg off than have you read this book.,"Please let me begin by agreeing with most reviewers that Aldous Huxley was a brilliant man, one of the most forward-thinking men in modern history and (on the whole) a wonderfully gifted writer. That being said, this book is absolutely, unequivocably horrible. It is 354 pages of plotless, repetitive socio-preach. Mr. Huxley's ""A Brave New World"" is, in my opinion, one of the best novels ever written. ""Island"" does not rise to that same level, though, and I would not wish it upon anyone."
2,"Well, not everything","It was a decent book, but not a lot of new information for me. For the most part, it simply confirmed some basics I have long believed in - not living out your dreams through your children, encouraging exploration without forcing achievement, the need to provide for additional means of learning, etc. A lot of time spent on selecting schools for gifted kids, which really doesn't apply in small towns like we live in. Some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods. A lot of ""real life"" examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approach.Probably the most novel idea that came across was that it's better to be a ""good enough"" parent than a perfect one. By Klein's opinion, if you manage to be the perfect parent, you set a standard so high that your child will have anxieties trying to live up to your example. Not sure I'm 100% with that, but it is an interesting take on parenting."
1,Software is Horrible!,This software is not user friendly. The samples don't help. I would imagine that if I sat down for a few hundred hours I could figure out were the dots go. The whole interface just doesn't make any sense. It's very time consuming. Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store.
2,Simply Borred,"Borred, Borred and very borred!! to much bla bla! I spected that this book would say something about ancient phylosopy, something to think about, but never get it, it is very borred."
2,Biography of Wright and his works,"Easy reading book which I would recommend for those who want a sort of ""executive summary"" of the story behind Wright and his works. Having said this, I found the depth and detail lacking for those who have read extensively about this architect whose noteriety is growing with time. Not for collectors unless you (like myself) want the book to help fill a spectrum of the vast number of publications which continue to come into popular view."
4,Top Ten List for Christians is in our Top Ten!,Our Sunday School Class of Middle aged adults ordered this book for class study. We are having a lot of fun with it and learning a lot at the same time. Great Study.
3,Pretty Box..,"I've seen two versions of this set, one has the typical cardboard box, and one comes in a nice metal tin. Mine happens to be the one in the tin which is mainly the reason I got it. For the most part, the transfers of the films are terrible. A lot of the time the pictures get so dark that you can't even tell what's going on. There are 31 shorts in all and I've not watched all of them yet so there may be a few that are of good quality. Over all, the tin looks nice but I wish the films were of better quality."
3,"""Rock the Joint!"" is better","Now, this was a complete thrill to have for me back when I first started buying Bill Haley CDs in October 2002, but when I heard about ""Rock the Joint!"" I thought this CD was extremely skimpy. It doesn't have the classic ""Rocket 88."" It doesn't have great tunes like ""Green Tree Boogie"" and ""Sundown Boogie."" This is very ... Doesn't even have a booklet, really. Sure, the old recordings at the beginning of his career in 1952 and 1953, but I would rather go with ""Rock the Joint!"" ... This CD includes classics like ""Rock the Joint,"" ""Rocking Chair On the Moon,"" ""Fractured,"" ""Crazy Man, Crazy"" and ""Real Rock Drive,"" though."
3,"Bill's early recordings, but not all of them.","These are Bill's recordings from the early 50s before he became immensely popular with ""Shake Rattle And Roll"" or ""Rock Around The Clock"". Sadly you don't find all of his great early stuff on this CD, but this is a good starter as the price is really low."
1,Wrong title and director,"There are two mistakes about this DVD. The English title for this Italian movie should be either Bread, Love and Dreams (original: Pane, amore e fantasia) or Bread, Love and Jealousy (original: Pane, amore e gelosia). The actors Vittorio de Sica, Gina Lollobrigida and Marisa Merlini played in both movies and the product description could easily be related to any of them. Both movies were directed by Luigi Comencini and not by Vittorio de Sica. Boudu Saved From Drowning is a very famous Jean Renoir movie from 1932. Both Italian movies are very good, but the one star is because of these mistakes."
2,"pretty rough, but it shows promise","The playing is merely competent, and the singing sounds like jump rope chanting much of the time. But there are flashes of inspiration. It's unlikely any of these songs will stay with you after the CD is over, nor will you feel much of a draw to put it on again."
3,Its OK,I bought this to match the set. The fabric is OK and of good quality. I was disappointed that it was not stuffed more. It is not a firm pillow but a very very soft flat pillow.
5,Lovely stories.,"Gwen Bristow is an amazing author. Her books may be a mite old fashioned, but she still packs an emotional, historical and cultural punch. Really a great read, as are her other novels. Don't miss out."
4,Almost as Good as the first book in this Trilogy.,"When I first read all three ""Plantation"" books by Gwen Bristow 20 years ago, I was so enthralled with them that I read them twice!! Well 20 years later and I just read all three of them again this past week. Great books that stand the test of time. Each book can be read alone but I recommend them as a series, loved them years ago and still love them!!"
2,A typical anti-Darwinism pseudoscience book,"The book contains 280 pages of text, 25 pages of refenreces, 7 pages of INDEX, and many figures and cartoon to explain the concept of author's hypothesis. Barbieri was a development biologist at MRC in Cambridge, NIH, and Max Planck.This is a typical anti-Darwinism semi-pseudoscience book. I picked up the book because the book cover had a Chomsky's accolade. It's not as obvious and outrageous as Intelligent Desing-sort of book, but the author cites his own book to explain his main points. Many biological facts in the book are real and correct, but there is no scientific logical structure to support the author's ""semantic"" theory. I was struck by the fact that this book was published from Cambridge University Press."
2,still the same old guys...,"Hello again, here we are. This is what I think after listening to the new album of Germanys' Thrash-Metal godfathers.Nothing new but still they rock like hell. Unfortunately they made a step backwards and not like Slayer or Mayhem a step forward. Well, I believe that some old school fanatics will enjoy this feature, but Sodoms'great days are gone. Their last good record was and will be ""Tapping the Vein"". I was a great fan of them for over 12 years but they just repeat themselves. I am not happy about giving such a cruel review about this record but I just had to say that. Sorry guys, better luck next time, ok?"
5,awsome metal dude,its like code red was an album from Sodom.This album is scarey and makes me feel cool
4,Great strategy game!,"I had experience of RTS games (Total Annihilation, Age of Empires and Empire Earth) and after I bought Praetorians and played the first time, I found it very very interesting.It's not the typical RTS game where you have to produce a lot of units and simply attack the enemy (like for example TA kingdoms or others) but you have to think in a strategic way before moving and attacking the enemy. In this game, mission by mission, you learn how to balance your troops and how to move in the territory. It's important the fact that troops can interact with territory (hills, woods). You can hide your troops, you can stay higher than the enemy and then attack you enemy suddenly (for example,if your bowmen are in a higher position they will hurt more seriously the enemy). In some missions you have to lay siege to a fortess with war machines.To sum up, I think it's a good game, if you want to enjoy yourself and live the experience of ""De Bello Gallico""!"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this game because my friend said it was excellent, however he's never been a very good gamer, I thought the no resource management idea was ok, but it ruins half the point of an RTS, and strategy is all about careful management of resources to fund your army, because, if you dont have any resources, you dont have an army ;-) I'd say ok for someone who doesn't really know how to play a REAL RTS, but if your an expert, I'd save up for Warcraft 3:The Frozen Throne, and if you haven't got the normal Warcraft 3, go buy it!"
1,A Rookie Game,"Everyone knows that a good strategy game involves somewhat of a steep learning curve and an advanced difficulty level. This game is simply a click and attack real time strategy that does not involve any heavy thinking. In fewer words it's the bunnie slope for youngsters that are just discovering the thrill of these games. In conclusion I feel the word strategy is innapropriate altogether! True strategy players will want to return the product, rookies will like it because they'll feel moderately challenged by it."
2,Elementary Differential Equations,"[..]Let me warn all potential customers that this book is all about quantity of material instead of quality. While the book does cover such advanced topics as Fourier Analysis and intro to Partial Differential Equations, the book lacks sufficient examples about what is being said (a number of sections have no examples at all).I did find the most well-written sections to be the application of second-order differential equations (applied to spring oscillations etc.) However, as far as getting a bang for your buck, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Morris Tennenbaum and Harry Polland's Ordinary Differential Equations Dover edition (cheaper, and MUCH MORE effective. Trust me)."
2,Difficult to follow,"I'm a student and am taking a class using this book. I've found it very difficult to follow and short on explanations. Without additional resources, I would not be able to learn the material in this book."
2,elem diff e-q's,"While the shipping was AMAZING, the book itself is not much use other than as a list of problems. The text explaining the theory behind is written like sandpaper and often jumps around leaving important processes out. It would be a very hard book to use as a solo resource w/o an instructor leading."
2,Not helpful...,"I decided to self study AP environmental science, which I eventually received a 5 for. This was a textbook I was considering to use, but I found it to be difficult to read (not to mention a bit politically-oriented). I would recommend Raven and Berg for APES, which is more concise and comprehensive for the test."
2,Not my taste in music,"Voice too ""breathy"" to suit my taste. I wouldn't say it is bad; just not the kind of music that I like."
4,No escape from noise,"Run the place red, the first cut, is great. If you like the recent direction being taken by people like Tim Hecker and Amon Tobin, consider this the Richard D. James twist on that cut-up trend, with his trademark super hyper drum track. And, like RDJ's past stuff, suitably nightmarish and queasy.The second two tracks are causing a bit of controversy, consisting as they do mainly of noise and analog-style knob tweaking sounds, high pitched shrieks, some distorted screams, etc. There is no beat, there is no melody, there is little apparent structure (although its marginally more structured than ""Metal Machine Music,"" but only just so). This is some of the most uncompromising music RDJ has done, and for him that's quite a statement. Maybe this is his remix of Subotnick's ""Silver Apples of the Moon"". Anyway, it's not for the faint of heart. It doesn't kick ... and it doesn't make your booty move, so you might want to stay away unless you're a real noise head."
4,Originally $12,"People look at this as a piss-take on an EP, just for RDJ's personal wealth and whatnot. And, truthfully, it is.But that doesn't make the one ""real"" track on here not worth the money.It does indeed, grow on you. Or else you love it right away. It's quite a departure from his normal works, rarely can you somewhat understand the lyrics, if there are any.The rest is a collection of annoying noises which will either make you or your neighbours go crazy. Nothing really ""musical"" comes out of them.So albeit is a rubbish of an EP, yet the first track is well worth the price, and if you're into ways of torturing people with different pitches of one noise, then you're set."
4,AFX - Smojphace,"I think AFX's take on ""Run the Place Red"" is incredibly fun -- it makes me want to jump and shimmy each time I hear it. Now, I'm not a huge fan of ragga, but ragga-jungle-drill 'n' bass? I think it's a genius combination, one that only the demented mind of Mr. James could discover. You can barely understand the vocals beneath the percussion -- they're more flavor than anything else. As for the two noise tracks, they're rather interesting the first time around (not to mention intense on the squeals), but I don't think they stand up to repeated listens. Mostly because I don't want to go deaf."
4,Nothing is what it appears--which is good :),"A little research on the internet would show that RDJ has put squealing noise tracks out like this before. The first track is great. However, all the negative reviews of the second and third tracks might be premature. On at least one other AFX CD I had (2 remixes?), the third track was similar witha high pitch and ticking. I recently found out that the third track on that EP was actually a graphic---it's data, not audio, an SSTV image. Likewise, maybe tracks 2&3 on the smojphace CD aren't music, but data. I no longer have the CD to try to decode it myself."
2,ok mr.,"i like everything aphex twin has ever made (with the exception of ""elephant song""), but this album is a piece of poo covered crust (thats right ""crust""!). i think mr. smiley here is just releasing the stupidest stuff he's ever made as some sort of artsy fartsy nut chunk because these songs stink flamboyantly. the first song features a reggae ""artist"" who has too much self esteem (if your gonna get excited about something dont make it reggae lyrics). anyway i hate lyrics, so i'm a little biased. the other parts in the song consist of drums...and some other insignificant effects. the other songs consist of only the latter; no music just stuff (which i know is arguably music also, but jeez 9 minutes then the next song is the exact same stuff). now i've gone and soiled myself i hope smiley mcgee is happy."
2,What a disapointment.,"Two years, and this is all we get? The first song is decent. It has some rap/reggae guy doing his vocal thang, with RDJ's music behind the background. Except for the first 10 seconds, the music itself exceptional. Nice crazy d'n'b stuff with vocals. This song is worth getting, but not for $$$ ! The other two tracks... they are just noise. It's as if he hooked up electrodes to his recording equipment and twiddled with the knobs or something. Or maybe he had real songs and then encrypted them. Who knows! They are not music. They're most likely a sick joke by RDJ."
3,hyper spacial weirdness,"Only true Aphex heads can apreciate this album. The first track offers a killer drum 'n bass journey. very hyper, withRDJ's insane trademark all over it, not run of the mill dn'b or anything. The rhythm fades out into static. It still pounds in your head and pulse as the second track begins which seems to have a distorted rhythm in keeping with the first, but then it just goes ballistic, think of tracks 2 and 3 as the inevitable comedown from the first track. Eat some chocolate covered espresso beans first and you will understand."
2,Raggae Mixed With Some Weird Techno,"but man yeah yeah yeah its good and all that, but man, 9 dollars for three songs?! isn't that like an oxymoron?"
4,Mostly for fans,"If you don't own anything by the Muffs, get the first self-titled CD or ""Blonder and Blonder"" first. Then come back for this one.This is a collection of alternative versions, demos, covers from compilations, and tunes that just didn't make the cut.It's still the best thing the band has released since ""Blonder and Blonder"". If you are a fan, then the liner notes by themselves are worth ten bucks.And you get 30 tunes for under $10! It's hard to find that kind of bargain these days.Don't make this your first Muffs album, but make it your third."
1,Very Disappointing.,"I was hoping that this band would have evolved in some or any degree over the past decade, but sadly they have not. Having the courtney love message on this cd is further testament that this band is tapped out. Now that Kim is in her 40s, you'd think there would be more emphasis to release a breakthrough cd rather than these out-takes from the past."
1,Don't Bother w/the Muffs...just Noise.,"Bought this CD thinking it would be similar to their cover tune, Kids in America.Was I wrong, this is worst cd I've has the displeasure to listen to.Old chic, lead singer does nothing but scream throughout all the tracks. The tunes are simplistic, lack depth and show no inkling of creativity.If you like endless screaming to nonsensical lyrics then this rubbish is for you."
5,Exactly what it says it is,"I'm an arts and crafts director for a girlscout camp, so I read a lot of craft books. Klutz really does have the best ones around. These rings are easy, the book gives you everything you need (but scissors) and there are several cute patterns. I'm sure campers will love these projects. The only complaints I have are with the included supplies-- the bead wheel is cumbersome to use, and the colors mix easily. Also, there isn't much variety in beads-- but you can easily supplement with whatever you have on hand."
3,ok item for the price,Didnt receive this banner until a week laterDidnt receive a confirmation online. It said it was shipped when it was sitting on my doorstep...Otherwise a great product and catches a lot of attention !!I will honestly say this is definately worth it if you want to fill in a big wall space or want to add a little bit more spice to your tailgate party..weather resistant so it can be outside and it also has metal gromets to hang easily anywhere..
4,"Good, But Not Great","It takes a good voice to sing Tobira Wo Akete, the second opening song for the show. In my opinion, Anza did a very good job singing this! The first time you hear this song, most people will think, 'ugh! this song sucks', but trust me, in a while you'll get used to it and love it as much as I do. Yoru no Uta and Tomoe are both sung by Iwao Junko, the voice actress for Tomoyo (Madison). Her voice is very soft and high-pitched, but if you love melancholy songs, you'll love these two songs. Honey is the ending song, very nicely sung [by chihiro], and addicting too. The Sakura version is similar to the song, Shiawase no Mahou.The only reason you should buy this CD is for Tobira Wo Akete, Yoru no Uta, Tomoe, and Honey. I would only suggest this for die-hard CCS fans. If you're not one of them, go buy the CCS Best Collection soundtrack."
2,Not good,"I didn't find this book at all interesting.. all though there was occasional humor.. in general, i didn't enjoy this piece of literature."
3,"Disgusting man, that father --","should have been locked up for the emotional abuse of his children.Clarence Day's writing style is adequate, the book reads quickly (I finished it in two brief sittings), but why Day would want to honor that horror of a father by writing a memoir about him is beyond me.Read the play instead, by Lindsay and Crouse. L & C had the good sense to soften the father's character and make him more palatable. In the play you will find humor, but not in the memoir."
4,Enjoyable memoir,"I just got this book and I am having a wonderful time reading the anecdotes of life in Victorian New York with an eccentric father. The humor is gentle and quiet, if you want outlandsih jokes the this is not the book for you.Of course, some of the customs and actions of the characters may seem odd by modern standards but we must remember that everything changes with time and in 150 years, people may look back at our culture and wonder if we were crazy.Still, in spite of its age, the humor of the book has held up remarkably well. Perhaps we all know a ""father"" type, an eccentric and bossy person who is somehow endearing nonetheless.So, don't obsess over the un-politically correct attitudes of the time covered, just enjoy the quiet humor and learn about a time gone by."
4,Life with Father (by Clarence Day),"I loved this book as a preteen and I loved it, and the sequel ""Life with Mother"" too. Mr. Day paints an accurate picture of life in the early 1900's for a middle class family. Yes, his father is rude and a bit obnoxious, but watching him is very funny. He loved his wife and family and while he blustered and yelled, they loved him. I enjoyed this book and thought it was great."
4,Adventure in geography,"Would you at the age of 25 leave home and go sailing around the world? Most of us would want to but only few of us would do it. William Albert Robinson was one of the few who took the adventure. It took him three years, three months, and nine days to do it. Robinson encountered cannibals, and head hunters, and Arab tribesmen who captured him and held him for ransom. He escaped them several times to continue on. He was also a keen observer of social life and customs in the South Pacific Islands. It is entertaining and informative book to read. You will not regret it."
5,"Useful, witty and profound","I have always loved Peter McWilliams poetry.He had the most impact on my style of writing poetry(Poems in the Key of Life...a Journey). I never knew he wrote non-fiction books. When I couldn't find his poetry books I came to Amazon to purchase them again. This is when I saw his non-fiction work. I bought one. I loved it. It is a useful guide how to go through life with less distress. He does it in a witty, amusing and easy to understand way. I think everyone should read his books. I plan on getting the rest of his work. I have no doubt I will enjoy them as much as I have this one."
5,The most wonderful self awareness/psychology book. A must read.,"When I was a Senior in High School I took an AP Psychology class and the teacher used this book. This book has helped me so much in life. It helped me understand all those awkward teenage years. Helped me deal with an abusive, destructive blended family and helped me learn about myself and my own dysfunctionsd. This is a wonderful book that is very easy to read and something that every one should read."
4,Everyone should read this book,"My high school teacher gave it to me as a gift over 10 years ago, I still find it fascinating and insightful. For people who like quotes about life, this is a must-have. It's an easy read for everyone, and makes you think. I definitely learned something about myself."
1,"Promising, but a let down.","Sorry, i just didnt get it. We all know the lessons provided in this book. Seems too repetitive. There are plenty of other self help books that are more useful than this one."
1,"Simplistic, humorous book on life.","This book really wasn't for me. It's the same tripe as 101 other books of the genre. Although, it might be useful to the right person. I'd happily recommend it as a gift for a teenager, or anyone who doesn't usually read books. The book reads a lot like the ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" series, with quirky quotes and anecdotes, but very little substance. On the bright side, after reading Chomsky or Neitzche, McWilliams is a comic relief."
1,Total disappointment,"I was totally disappointed with the book for two reasons. One, it had a different author than the one I ordered. Two, it was tremendously boring. A waste of the little money I did spend to get it."
2,A highly mixed blessing (?!),"The quotes are wonderful, but the rest is an atrocity and an offense to the intellect of the reader with all the simplifications and self-pity. Please read some literature instead."
2,"It's never too late to write a ""self-improvement"" book","Half the book (literally) is quotes. The rest, a bunch of touchy-feely, quite unmitigated flapdoodle. In my opinion, anyways. Considering how easily and cheaply quotation dictionaries can be had these days, I'd say, go to the source <g>, and just get one."
5,Best band no one knows,"End of Romance is the great new album by one of the best rock and roll bands that no one has ever heard of. The album starts out with the rocking ""I'm No Angel"" which is a vastly different sound than anything on the band's previous works. The drum beat to this song will instantly have you pounding the dashboard in your car as you drive with the windows down and the stereo blasting. Other highlights include ""Walking Years Away"" and the best song on the album, ""Northstar"". The song ""Coping"" which was on the ""Born and Razed"" album makes an appearance in a different arrangement; one that gives the song a much harder edge, on this record. All in all ""End of Romance"" is a terrific rock and roll album and one that will hopefully garner the Charlie Mars Band the audience they deserve."
1,HA!,"I know bad music when I hear it. Here 'tis. The lead singer is the main problem, the band are not too bad, just apparently under the leadership of this mo. Go back to mommy and daddy in TX."
4,Working Jeans,They are definitely a man's pair of jeans. Couldn't imagine they would be more stiff and plain then when I tried them on. Good working jeans now.
4,Quick Service,This style and the size my husband needs has not been available in our local stores. I was able to find what I needed quickly online and the shipping was very prompt. I would have given it five stars but he hasn't had time to try them on yet so I can't give a perfect score.
1,Poor quality and high price... are these knock-offs?,"I ordered two in Cowboy Slim Cut 33x34. I already had some Wranglers. The waist was way too small, the fly was off to my left in a really weird and very ugly and uncomfortable way. These were made in Mexico, just like the ones I bought at Target, but the badging was different, a rubber badge on the back right pocket, not the thin leather Wrangler badge at the rear right waist. Were these knock-offs? Not sure. Returned them and went to Target where I got two pair for $15.99 each (they were Original and Legendary Gold, not Cowboy, but still, half the price, pard)!"
1,Too short product & too bad shipping process,"I got the black stockings in size A/B. They are way off too short. Almost 1"" above my knees. I am 5'3"" and 125 lbs. Make sure you order at least one size up.I am also disappointed with the customer service. Shipping took exactly 2 weeks. I do not think I would like to order another thing from Essential Apparel."
3,Nice thigh highs.,"I purchased these just to see what they would be like. They were perfectly nude and you truly couldn't tell I was wearing them. I think I may have preferred just a bit darker since my legs are light color but for the price, I'll keep them. The lace was pretty and they were very soft on the skin and to the touch."
3,Upholds well,"Nice and sleek. Very sexy and they are run resistant. However, I did end up putting a hole in the lace but it did not effect the hose."
3,Serviceable,"I got the black stockings in size A/B. I'm small, but they stay up fine. They're good, average stockings. If you're looking for the really silky kind that make people go ""ooh"" when they touch them, these are not it. But they're perfectly fine for everyday wear."
5,Great Quality,They were really soft and great quality. No defects (which is always nice lol). The fiance and I both loved them.
5,A lingerie must-have,I hate the modern day thigh highs with the silicone bands that hold them up on your thigh. These stockings do not have them in the lace trim. A garter belt is required or garter straps on your favorite bustier. Gives you that sexy garter style without the unsightly bulging and uncomfortable pinching.
4,Almost perfect,"Stockings are not easy to find where I live in Northern California and I cannot stand to wear panty hose. I decided to try these stockings that was recommended by the site I used to find a garter belt. I really like the stockings. They are darker black than the picture depicts them. I prefer off-black. The lace top is a little tight with not too much stretch, so if you have large thighs you might not like them. The next order I will order one size larger for that reason although I do not have large thighs. My husband really likes them and the fact that I like them makes him happy. I will buy more."
4,Lovely stockings,"To date these are my favorite stockings - absolutely beautiful lace top and a lovely hand to the leg. The lace is quite substantial though and with many of the tiny buttons on garter belts this can be a problem. If your thighs not thin, go up a size - I always have.However this is a fabulous stocking that fits, wears well, and feels very nice. THe black is a bit darker than I would prefer."
1,Did not get what I ordered,"I just got these stockings but the seller sent me a way smaller size (A-B) than I ordered, I e-mailed them telling them about the problem and will keep you dear buyer posted. I cannot tell you about anything about the quality or color because I have not opened the ones I received."
4,Good Golly It's Little Richard,"It's really Little Richard singing some great Little Richard tunes with all the ""woo!""s in the right places. But they're not the original recordings, and while still one hell of a singer and performer, the strain of time can be heard as he slowly but surely goes out of key toward the end of the recording. The back-up musicians don't seem to have quite the same energy as the original Disturbers, either. That all said, this is a nice collection of some of his best songs an the price is right."
2,"Not original hit versions, yet nowhere does jacket or CD say so","I've owned this CD for a few years, yet thought something was slightly off, so I compared ""Keep A Knockin"" to another copy I have.Results:Original is 168 beats per minutes, while this version is 172 beats per minute.Original's time is 2 min. 23 seconds; this version is 2:16 min."
4,I love this set!,"I purchased this set for myself, because I fell in love with the design. A piece was chipped in the first shipment, but Amazon sent me the replacement immediately. I appreciate their quick response. It might not be the ""every-day"" set, as it is rather fragile(otherwise, I'd rate it 5 stars), but the design is wonderful. A perfect gift!"
5,Beautiful and arrived perfect!,"I have been wanting this pattern for some time now, so I finally ordered it (3 actually)and they just arrived, very well packed, not a scratch on them, and on time!And you can't beat the price from Amazon, I saved about $75 on each set!"
3,It's just okay,"These hooks could have stronger magnets. They look nice, and the size is adequate, but the magnets are barely strong enough to hold a pot holder. With a stronger magnet, these would be a great product. For now, meh."
3,Not very strong,Looks great but they will barely hold my set of keys (4 keys and a keyless entry) or a pot holder before they start to slide down my fridge. I thought the magnet on the back would be bigger...maybe I can replace it with my own.
3,"Good for holding small items, but the magnet is weak","I use these hooks on the side of my fridge to hold my keys and lanyard for my job's ID badge and the hooks still slide a bit from the weight if I'm not painstakingly delicate. In the case of my key ring, this is particularly discouraging as the ring isn't loaded with the usual assortment of retail cards and/or gaudy key chains a lot of folks have; only two small keys and my car's door opener.I can't imagine these being viable for anything heavier than a small key ring or similarly light object as they're currently issued. Perhaps a trip to the hardware store is in order for some stronger magnets and adhesive. I do like the look of the hooks, especially against my brushed stainless steel fridge, but the magnets are simply too small and weak for most applications."
5,Marshall Hollenzer is Driving,"This is a superbly written book. Witty, clever, and thought provoking, I found if hard to put down. It is filled with quirky and interesting characters, prose that flows, and subtle humor that occasionally had me laughing out loud. I cannot wait to read the next book by this promising young author."
3,Slim,Pretty good lyrics. Slim Thug sounds like he comes from that class of rappers under the Houston legend Big Love. That ESG cat has an irritating voice. Overall cool album.
5,CAREFUL what you order,It is a great tool and glad the manufacturer stands behind their products. They exchanged the Spanish for English. The tools is worth the money just make sure you get it in the correct language. I am just to OLD to learn a new language.
3,Only for the scholar,"Theft of the Nation is a scholarly work. Does a very good job of describing the structure, hierarchy, operations of Organized Crime in America. However, the book was written over thirty years ago. I would only recommend this book to someone who was seriously in the study of crime, organized crime, law enforcement, etc... because it is rather dryly written."
4,Caribes,"I haven't actually read Cienfuegos - yet. However, I purchased Caribes via the internet purely because I had been recommended the author and did not realize until I received it that it was the second of a series. Today I was looking for the third in the series - Azabache as I simply have to find out what happens to Cienfuegos next! Caribes is the first spanish book I have read cover to cover and I can't wait to get hold of the next . Great characterization. Vasquez - Figueroa certainly has a vivid imagination which constantly surprises you while instilling a sense of history about the conquest of the New World. Please, please please can Amazon get in ALL of the books in this series as well as Tuareg and Yaiza which I have also been highly recommended (untranslated)"
3,Entertaining way to learn about the discovery of America,"I was given the whole Cienfuegos series (six books in total) as a Xmas present and I didn't stop until I read all of them. The plot is full of action and attractive characters and you learn a lot of History as you enjoy it. Vazquez Figueroa takes you on board the Santa Maria to discover the New World and feeds you with lots of true information about those first and critical years of conquest and colonization. I have not read other books by this author, but I am sure I will in the future. One thing I don't like, though, is the poor literary quality of the text (in the Spanish version). Sometimes you wonder how some of the more obvious mistakes went past all editing controls. Other than that, a wonderful read."
2,What a disappointment!,"I am a big Belva Plain fan and have always enjoyed her books. After the Fire is a disappointing read. What bothered me the most is the character of Hyacinth-what a weak and stupid woman! She is not believable at all. Any mother will fight to the end for her children. I kept hoping she would snap out of it, but she never did. She just kept trusting stupid men and believing them. I will think twice before spending money on another Belva Plain novel in the future."
5,WONDERFUL,Another Winner for Belva. The characters are real and you will both laugh and cry. The story is believable. You will not be able to put it down.
1,Unbelievable,"I'll have to reserve a higher rating until I finish this saga. I think I will have to agree with the previous reviewer that gave a low rating. The dialog is so stilted I can't believe what I am reading. I AM a Belva Plain admirer, but her writing here leaves much to be desired.Back to this unbelievable couple and their disolving marriage."
5,This book is a straight 5 starts!!,"I'm an avid reader of Belva Plain's books, and After The Fire is just another one of her masterpieces. I really don't understand how anyone who've read this book can think otherwise."
2,Not my kind of book,This is the first novel by Belva Plain I have read and I can say without hesitation it will be my last. I found the entire premise to be nothing short of silly (how many mothers would give up their children based on their supposed involvement in an accidental fire?) The plot was laughable and the main character pathetic. Sorry I wasted my time on this one.
3,OK....,"I used to read Belva Plain quite a bit; it's been a while...but I found this on my shelf. It was an ok read. Probably about as good as what her other books were, but I was in high school/college when I was reading them and tastes change.The premise was pretty interesting, but after a while Hyacinth, who is hiding a secret I won't spoil- starts to get on your nerves. Towards the end you're ready to yell at the novel to just get on with it!! I think the other thing that gave me mixed feelings with this book was that I really just didn't understand Hyacinth as a mother...I won't bore you with it, but I just didn't ""buy"" her as a loving mother.If you like Plain you might enjoy this book...other than that I really can't recommend it to anyone."
4,A Good Read,"Hyacinth has met the love of her life, Gerald, a medical student who wants to marry her. She is sure that theirs will be a ""happily-ever-after"" marriage. Her mother warns her about things she has observed in Gerald, but Hyacinth, undaunted, proceeds with the wedding. As it turns out, Mother really does know best in this case but Hyacinth has to learn this the hard way. Gerald uses an unfortunate incident against Hyacinth and she loses everything that she loves. Eventually she finds her true niche in life through a man who loves her, but her secret past keeps her from marrying him. This is a good page-turner and one in which you do care about the main character."
2,Plain disappointed,I always read Belva Plain's new books since I have enjoyed her previous books very much. I found this book to be predictable from the onset. I looked at the front of the book twice to be sure I hadn't inadvertently grabbed a Danielle Steele book from the library shelves. The story line is a standard and I found nothing redeeming or unique in any of the characters. I didn't feel any empathy for Hyacinth's situation since it seemed totally unrealistic that she would have relinquished her children without resorting to every possible alternative. I am certain that Belva Plain will return to her previous writing style with her next book(s)...please.
4,Mr & Mrs Who?,"I am well into the book and am enjoying it as I am a fan of Belva Plain. However, no where so far do I find the last name of Hyacinth's family or Gerald's family. They are Dr & Mrs Gerald Who? Am I missing something or was this intentional on the part of the author?"
3,Good not great.,"Looks like OEM, but the fit wasn't quite as tight as the factory original but otherwise worked fine. Easy installation"
2,Defective,"When I attempted to install the mirror onto my pickup, the three screws came unthreaded from the housing, which means that I cannot tighten the mirror to my pickup."
3,Pretty good read...but take with a grain of salt,"The author relates actual events in Texas Ranger history as though he was present. However, the Texas State Historical site has no record of him ever being on Ranger rolls."
4,"Good period piece, taken with a grain of salt","Interesting anecdotes of a white man living among the indians, the hardships and struggles, but it's obviously a biased tale. Quite a stretch for the reader to believe that a man- Texas Ranger no less- would be unable to ""escape"" before 3 years. Personally I don't believe it. Anyway, while one reviewer highlights a particular commanche torture to an infant, it's best to keep everything in perspective and acknowledge the extreme brutality whites displayed against all tribes in the western hemisphere- for example, Sand Creek, Wounded Knee. That said, if you like stories similar to this, try Nat Love's autobiography."
4,Nice set,"Not top of the line, but adequate. Purchased for my son-in-law. He's happy with it to use with his woodburning stove in their first home. I would purchase it again."
2,The paint cover is flammable,"Bought this set based on low price and good reviews. Works fine for poking logs occasionally and cleaning up when stove is cold, but while using the shovel in the fire, the black coating started bubbling, then caught fire."
1,Lousy workmanship,"This product does its job, but not very well. All the end pieces, except the shovel, and the handles have to be attached to the rods. The poker, the main tool used, does not fit on the rod very well, and will spin loose when trying to move a log. My husband said he will weld it on so it won't move. Would recommend a different product, probably something that is constructed of one piece."
3,you get what you pay for...,"This item ships slow and the quality is cheap. I dont see how it's triple plated? It's just cast iron.For the price it's not bad, but there are many others that look better for a little more money. It's just okay."
3,Good set for the price...,Only problem with it is that the big metal handles make it difficult to take in and out of the metal hooks that hold it on the stand.
2,it works as intended...,"It does the job, yet most certainly strictly utilitarian. No frills. Not sure it will last long. Not in any manner decorative."
5,Better than expected!,"For thirty bucks, I wasn't expecting much. After reading the reviews, I knew not to expect much. I went so far as to add J-B Weld to my order in anticipation of wobbly joints.I've used it on one fire so far, and I have no need for the J-B Weld yet. When assembling it, the threads all seemed to fit quite well--very snugly, tight, and firm. No wobble. Can't beat the value of these. And all it takes is to J-B weld if it ever starts to ""go cheap"" on me."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased these fireplace tools with great anticipation of beautiful, warming fires. The tools are cheaply made and if you don't put them into the holder the right way they get stuck and it's difficult to remove the handle. Do not recommend."
2,Works,It was a bit confusing to assemble. Had to redo a few times before I got the right rods with the right utensils. In the end you get what you paid for - bottom of the line product for cheap.
1,did not like,This set is very small. Not happy at all. Bought it because other people gave good reviews. We have a wood burning stove. The poker is not long enough to safely move logs around.
2,broken,When the tool set arrived it was okay..smaller than I thought but mostly one of the tools was broken so it made the set not acceptable.
2,You get what you pay for.,"I was expecting a bigger set so was surprised at how small it was. I should have spent more for a better set, but it will have to do for now."
4,About what I expected,"It was about everything I expected because I read the reviews first. I wanted something that would be very inexpensive, but would serve the purpose. So far I have no complaints I have had several fires in my fireplace and it has served the purpose for which it was intended quite well.Each piece is a good weight in your hand, the stand is a little unstable but I just set it close to the hearth wall and its ok.Overall I am very happy especially for the price I paid for it."
3,"Attractive, but not that sturdy","This item is very attractive, but some of the components (like the small stand), are not very sturdy, hence the 3 stars. The shovel is sturdier than it looks, but I've been very annoyed by how easily knocked over the stand is! If the solid base were just a bit bigger, it would be PERFECT!"
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed in the CD because I am a fan of the trio and this one had too much input from other musicians. I guess I was looking for unadulterated Steve Newcomb (sp). My error.
1,Wrong Country for the product,"Had to call the MFGR'er to be informaed that the model I was sent does not fit on any GOLF with US Specs,it was manufactured for the UK version of the Golf, which has less ""plumbing"" and emmission gadgetery.For my model, the only option is the replacement filter (square) that fits in the filter box."
3,Worth the price,"This is a nicely designed, easy to manipulate, sim/tycoon game. The graphics are good, and it has a low learning curve. Of course, these kinds of games are not for people who like action or shooters, so just know that there are no real ""disasters"" or anything.I got tired of the limited number and type of items I could place, and would have liked to have seen a sort of ""shop generator"" or something to really customize it. You can't even change the colors on the buildings to create a theme or atmosphere.Overall, though, it is worth the price, and will provide you with several hours of enjoyment. It is fun to go back to after you have sort of played it out, and just see what kinds of layouts you can create.Happy gaming!"
2,Failed to Work,I was unable to get this game to work in Windows Vista. I inquired about a patch but did not receive a response.
5,This is what a management game should be!,"Virtual Resort: Spring Break is a highly addictive, surprisingly humorous management game with detailed graphics. True, you will need a powerful computer to get it to run smoothly, but when it does it is well worth it. It requires a decent amount of thinking and rewards you with entertaining animations. Being able to import your own music is a great feature. The level of control that is involved is what makes the game so addictive. It is actually entertaining to sit back and watch all the little things that are going on on your island. All other management games should strive to be half as fun as this one."
3,Break,"Almost like gimme a break, theres no additions, extra downloads. Started to get a little bored. It's now in the back of my closet!!"
5,An adult sim,"I have enjoyed this game. It seems easy but you'll find yourself out of time or money before you have met your objectives. You don't feel cheated, it makes you want try again and again. Maybe no one will drown and perhaps you can even turn a profit. I'm looking forward to many hours of entertainment."
5,Great Music--Fun Game,"I loved the music for this game and the 20 bucks i spent on this thing when i bought a few years ago was well spent. Its the oldest game for my computer that i still play, probably because there are no sequels, but i burnt the music to a cd and can listen to it in my car. For the 3.50 the game is going at now you might as well just buy it to try it, then again you have to factor in shipping cost, but all in all a great game especially for under ten dollars."
3,Very good concept...,"This is a great game, with a great concept and fun graphics. Unfortunately, the game shudders every two minutes of gameplay so I am forced to change the screen resolution of the game. This happens on my brand new laptop, while on my home computer it works perfectly."
2,Spring Break - a lot of fun without the sunburn!,"My favorite game was roller coaster tycoon, until this one came along. I downloaded the demo and bought the full game on the same day. Spring break is great fun."
2,Not my type..,"Pros and cons of the game...Pros:*Great plot,U have to become the best chef and beat the evil omni food empire.*Quite fun since u are able to join cooking competitions*U feel a sense of sastification when u watch people dine in ur restaurant.CONS:*GRaphics are a boo-boo,the graphics was blur*There aren't there many furniture to choose from unlike the sims.*VEry limited control-all u do is watch ur customers eat.At first,u will feell very sastified....but after a while u become very bored.U just wait for people to enter the restaurant and buy recipes from them.I really wouldn't recommend this game beacuse i had very limited control over the restaurant.....All i did was sit and watch the customers dine.....Now how much of a game is that?!I got sick and tired of it after two days of playing."
5,BB's the Best!,It doesn't matter what this Master sings; he is the best. I have been a fan of BB's forever. There is no such thing as a bad BB collection of songs.
3,Left wanting,"I gave this book a 3 only because it held me from start to finish, but few of the main characters were believable from beginning to end so I couldn't give it a 4 or 5. Things went from just plain ""bad"" to ""evil"" way to fast and the actions of Travis towards the end of the book were just too far out of character from how he was portrayed in the beginning. I couldn't buy a 12 year old doing what he did. I certainly did not put this book down and think ""good read"". More like ""well - that was disturbing"". Still - the author kept me hooked until 1am, so he gets a 3 for keeping me up way past my bedtime!"
3,Very disturbing novel,"I was told about this writer by a friend of his. I was expecting a lot from his book, but I found it to be very disturbing. Aunt Delia was a sick character and I didn't feel this was a ""coming of age"" story, but a twisted one. The writing was from Travis' point of view, but still seemed a bit simplistic. I haven't read any other novels by this author, but I hope this is not his usual subject matter. I wouldn't recommend this book to my friends. I finished this book with the same feeling I had when I saw the movie ""Deliverance""."
4,SWEET DREAM BABY: Faux-Faulkner in Florida,"SWEET DREAM BABY isn't grand fiction, but it's an engrossing story with a vivid sense of time and place. The author has pulled off the difficult trick of showing the world through a child's eyes and yet supplying the reader with adult perceptions. Parts of the plot are predictable, but at the conclusion predictibility flies out the window. The novel may be set in the '50s, but this is not a Leave-it-to-Beaver ending.Anyone with firsthand experience of the fifties may have to stretch their suspension of disbelief regarding certain sexual behaviors by the protagonist's aunt in relation to her nephew, but the author has traded a bit of unlikeliness for a gimmick that elevates this novel from the usual coming of age story."
5,How to Own Your Home Years Sooner- without making extra inte,"This book should wake up more people to the opportunity to manage and take control of their mortgage instead of the bank controling you. Good information, outlined well with easiy to understand examples.As and extra bonus it was great to meet the author Harj Gill the other night as he presented his information and also showed how to apply this knowledge to your business too.Look for this book to make a difference in banking here in the U.S."
1,Mathematical nonsense,"Mathematically speaking, this book is all nonsense. For instance, the author argues that owning a home is more expensive than not owning. This is true if you compare a person living under a tree versus one owning a home. He argues that the person owning a home has a negative cash flow of 8k per year all due to the interest he pays on mortage. But the details he left out (just to make his useless point) is, the person who owns a home has a home to live for a few hundred more bucks a month, whereas the person who doesn't own a home has to pay may be 10-15k per year for rent. That wipes out the savings that the author is claiming. Not only that, that money is down the drain since it goes to the landlord, whereas the owner of the home builds equity.My recommendation is to stay away from this nonsensical book, else you will be screwed if you follow his advice."
2,A verbose informercial,"This entire book could be summed up in 10 pages. It is terribly repetitive. The basic premise is that one can use a HELOC instead of a Checking Account so that your money doesn't sit around idle while mortgage interest is accruing. This may have some merit, but it is not clear how much of the savings is due to putting all of your disposable income towards your mortgage. The big trade off is a loss of liquidity. I have been aware of this strategy for a while, and I hoped that this book would help to prove its effectivness, and explain exactly how to do it. It falls short. After reading numerous message boards on the subject, this book tought me nothing new. It really feels like an informercial that I paid for."
5,What an Eye-Opener!,"When you understand that banks are interested in making money -- LOTS of it -- for themselves, you'll understand why this book was written. It helps you keep more of your money while still paying off what you borrowed, only faster.For a conventional mortage, most of the payments in the first few years go primarily to paying the interest on the loan, with very little going to the principal. With most people moving to a new one (trading up) every 5-7 years, they wind up paying LOTS of interest with very little to show for it. The banks get VERY rich this way.With this book, you can learn how to move out of that pool of quicksand and stand on solid financial ground. Harj writes clearly and simply without talking down to you. He lays it all out from beginning to end, and everywhere in between.More than worth the INVESTMENT in your life. Definitely read it."
2,Boring ...,"I bought the book because I read the review and it look interesting and funny. But after the first pages, I knew that this was a mistake. Is very repetitive and some of the content really ridiculous for this age and time."
2,Stuck With You,"I didn't really like the book. If the author didn't write the sex portion of the book, there would not have been much to write about. What happened with Nick and the law suit. It was barely mentioned. She could have written more about that and less the descriptive sex."
2,Harlequin Romance in sheep's clothing,Pretty much just a business woman's Harlequin Romance.Sex scenes in a book cover you're not 100% embarrassed to be seen reading in public.
1,Too blunt for me!,"All I can really say is I didn't even finish the book. I love romances but this one wasn't for me. I found it too much to read about sexual desire and how the body responds to it, that was too much for me. I would say this book should say blush or some kind of note to let people know its not clean romance."
1,Don't Bother,"This was a free kindle purchase. I guess you get what you pay for with the Kindle.This was absolute drivel! This writer neither knows southerners nor humour. The story was so unbelievable, it was laughable. Could not finish this pile of ..."
5,Love this story. Well written,I love this story. Loaned it to my sister and she was just as impressed as I was. Highly recommended.
3,A pastime ..,"Even thou the situation is a ""little"" unbeliavable, it was a fun read. He is a lovable character. You'll finish the book with s smile."
3,Not for sharing with your teenagers,A very superficial romance novel with lots of good humor and insight into the legal issues of divorce and family relationships..OK to read on the beach!
3,Funny but...,"I enjoyed his book. It was funny although a bit too much one liners. I did however DISLIKE the comparison of one of the characters looking at another like ""an Ethiopian child looks at a seven course feast"" or something like that. Really? There is NOTHING even REMOTELY funny about a STARVING CHILD!!! Although I managed to finish the book, and enjoyed other aspects of it, that one line stayed in the back of my mind. :("
3,Kind of simple,"It held my interest and had a few entertaining moments. Paige's family was more interesting than she was. Her brother and Rachel kind of got shorted in the plot development area. Their story seemed to be paralleling Ross and Paige then suddenly they all but disappeared--too bad.The main plot point with the quarantine was a bit too unbelievable. It was a different twist on throwing two very mismatched people together for a long period of time, but it had a lot of holes in it. I liked Ross, although at times he seemed a bit too perfect, but Paige needed someone to grab her by the shoulders, shake her hard, and tell her to get over herself."
1,Total Garbage!!,"I got this book free for my Kindle. I have read a lot of free Kindle books and most of them are not that great, but they are at least a little entertaining. This is the first book I have deleted before finishing it. I read to 35% and just could not take any more! It was not funny at all, it was super annoying and predictable."
2,Boring,Maybe my expectations are too high but after reading the reviews I expected more. I thought the plot was too unrealistic for me to even be interested in. I liked the characters but I found myself flipping through pages just to get through the book.
2,"The writing is good, but the plot needs a lot of work.","I love books that make me laugh, and a friend told me about this book. I paid full price, and I feel somewhat had. Ms. Jensen has a gift for humor, but the plotting involved in this book is horrible. Good humor has to have some element of believability in it, and this book has none whatsoever. With a believable story line, Ms. Jensen could be among the top humor writers out there."
4,Love Bug Virus versus the real thing - LOVE!,"Need a fun ""pick-me upper"" for a quick read- try this one. Paige is a tax lawyer handling a cousin's divorce case while Ross is a divorce lawyer handling the cousin's spouse's side of the case. They can't stand each other- until they are forced to spend unlimited time for 2 weeks quarentined together in a hospital due to being exposed to a virus. Virus - The LoveBug! Lots of passion- due to the virus or could it be love?"
4,Stuck With You,"If you are looking for a humorous, contemporary romantic novel 'Stuck With You' is the book for you. The characters are well developed; even the secondary ones are very humorous. It had me laughing out loud in parts. Although the plot is a little over the top, it is great fun and very easy to read; perfect for unwinding after a hard day."
3,eh........,"""Stuck With You"" was o.k. The idea for the story was a cute one, but I thought that the characters were woefully underdeveloped and some of the dialogue and situations were so cheesy I couldnt help but cringe. This is the only book that I have ever experienced by this author, and while I wont say it was awful, I will say that it just wasnt for me. Mediocre at best."
3,Middle of the road,Ms. Jensen has tried to write an interesting story. Unfortunately I was not able to suspend myself from reality far enough to accept the premise of these being the only two people exposed to a possible virus. What about the EMT's and people in the emergency room? And there was ONLY one room to keep a man and a woman in? I can only give this book a mediocre rating for a mediocre story. :-(
3,A enjoyable read but not quite ....,The story started off with great promise. From the beginning we have interesting characters in a situation if not exactly plausible then almost believable. The situation of the forced isolation was comedic with the potential to for a lot of development of the main characters. Instead the author used some of this time to develop an sub-story among secondary characters. While I enjoyed this secondary sub-story and the host of interesting other characters in the story I came away feeling that the main characters story was always rushed when the focus of the story returned to them.
3,Bought on Kindle,"I saw the cover and was drawn in (I usually pick books based on the cover-not sure why). Anyways, it was a cute book and a very quick read. Not sure if it would be something I would recommend. I got it for a great price on Kindle, so I could not pass up Chick Lit."
3,"A bit predictable, but a fun read","This was certainly a fun read, but a little on the silly side. The ""virus"" that they were possibly infected with seemed a bit of a stretch, but a cute read non-the-less."
1,Too old to matter,"This book really should be removed from circulation. While basic MIDI information is in there, it is so out of date it just makes it hard to read. Examples are of obsolete or vintage gear and has no real relation to todays musician.Illustrations are all cheesy and look like bad microsoft clipart. Photographs are all poor and dated. The section on MIDI and a personal computers lists atari and commodore as possible good choices - get the picture!If you are looking for charts of Control codes etc, - they are in here, but you can find those anywhere. If you are trying to get information on MIDI in the last decade or so, buy a different book."
2,Somewhat outdated,"This book was published in 1987 and reprinted in 1994. The book does recognize that it is really when the MIDI-instruments are connected to a computer that MIDI takes on its real power, but only 10% of the book talks about MIDI and computers. The chapter on computer tells you about the choice between PC, MAC, Atrari and Commodore, and explains in length what a CD-rom is, and why we need it (not all programs fit on a floppy disk...) Sequencer program are mentioned, but barely so.The book does a fair job in explaining the MIDI standard and how it works, but it does not help me at all when I want to get started in connecting the components to my PC. I do think this was an excellent book in 1987, but digital music has moved on a long way since then."
3,"Beautiful, but a let down","The music is absolutely beautiful , It is sung by Maaya. the let down is that there are only four tracks though two songs ('I am a Dreamer' and '24') sung by Maaya and the other two without Maaya, besides that its okay!"
2,Hmmm.,"Well, I guess if you've never heard this kind of stuff before then it's fine, but it certainly is not the future of music. Listen to Papalotl instead."
4,A very good resource book for ERP professionals,"As the title sounds, the author explained very well about the integration issues that companies who are aiming to become World Class Manufacturing companies status should look into. I stongly suggest those professionals who are being involved in the ERP business to read this book. Flow chart diagrams represent the best way to describe the integration processes among functional areas."
2,very cheaply made,"I just received this today and while I knew to expect nothing hand crafted, I was shocked at how amazingly flimsy this thing really is. The bottom wood actually came with a huge crack; big enough to leak out all the sand. The feet were glued on with cheap glue and 3 of the 4 came off in transit. Based on the construction, I'm amazed it was even in one piece.The reason this gets 2 stars is that the accessories are pretty decent. And the sand looks fine. If this wasn't cracked in the center, I'd most likely have kept it and it would have ""worked"" for its purpose. Having said that, if you are looking for a desktop zen garden, look elsewhere."
2,Read the reviews first!,"I bought this on a whim, as it was the first Zen garden that I could find. I did not look at the reviews, and immediately regret it upon receiving my Zen garden. The other reviews summed it up nicely. The product is exactly what you pay for.Image:[...] - You can see the gap between the border/frame and the bottom piece. The tacks were put in, but did not hold the board to the border/frame. You should probably buy some wood glue, push lightly to separate the border, then press it back together with a small vice."
3,"Great Idea, Flimsy construction","I loved it when it got here. It looked nice and was very relaxing to use. The meditation book was a wonderful addition! Unfortunately the box is not sealed closed and sand is constantly escaping from the bottom. (not huge drifts, but little trickles). Overall, not the best made product."
2,"Cheap, and it shows","The product looks really nice when you open it. But when I took the zen garden out of the box, I discovered that two of the four feet had come off, and that the bottom was only attached to the sides in four places, at the corners. Along all four sides, it was bowed out with loads of space.I pushed it all together and glued the feet back on, but I'm keeping this in the bottom of the box it shipped in, lest I end up with fine white sand all over my desk. (I have this item at work.) When I leave the job or change work areas, I think I'll toss this rather than trying to bring it with me.Otherwise, it works as advertised. Really, it's hard not to, as it's sand and rocks in a tray. It's just hard to believe that a tray you put sand in could have been screwed up this way."
3,it serves it's purpose....,"It' s smaller than I expected which seems to be a common theme throughout the reviews. Not very durable...it needs to be deeper, very hard to rake and not get sand everywhere."
5,stress reliever,Co-workers stop to comb the sand and ask where I got it. Its a great time out in a stressful environment.
3,Fell apart,"When I opened the box and took out the item, the frame fell apart. I like the size and looks of the item, so I decided to keep it and glue it back together. It is very cheaply made."
2,Soothing,Creates a big mess. It's also pretty small so it gets very boring after a while. I've had it for like 6 months and used it twice. and that was the first week i got it.
4,Great desk item,"This item is great for sitting on a desk top in an office, classroom, etc. It arrived quickly and seems to be good quality for the price."
1,very poor construction,"For the price this very simple apparatus should function flawlessly. Its one job is to hold sand. I wish I noticed out of the box that one of the edges of the bottom where it meets the frame was bowed out enough to leak sand (salty looking sand) all over my desk. Annoying. I scooted as much sand out of the way as I could to duct tape this edge on the inside. When I have the time, I'll probably dump out the sand and tape all the edges because I don't trust it.The hassle this has caused is definitely not zen."
4,Exactly What I Wanted,"I bought this gift for my boyfriend who is going into law school. It was partly a gag gift, but I really did think he could use it to relax when he gets overly stressed. He already loves it and has used it a ton. I love that there are two rakes, and the rocks are appropriate for the size of the garden. There is quite a bite of sand, and it does spill over the edges a little bit when you are using it, but it isn't a huge deal. I can see where other people might have had problems with the base, but this one is just fine and there have been no leakages. I also love the size of this one because it is large enough that you can make great designs in the sand. I had considered going with something smaller, but now I'm glad I didn't because I don't think it would have nearly as much fun or relaxing. I definitely would recommend this for anyone looking for a simple gift that everyone can enjoy."
5,Great for office,I purchased this for my new office and I love it and so does everyone who comes in.
2,broken :(,The base and frame were not completely attached. Fixed with a little glue. My friend loved it after that.
4,Nice but Watch Out!,"Once I shook it a little to make it the sand flat, sand started pouring out the bottom sides because the bottom wood had pulled away from the tacks or nails. I poured the sand back into the packaging box for safekeeping and took the box home for repairs (I bought it for my office). I still like this item; the size is perfect, the sand is nice and plentiful and the rocks are nice river rocks, not too shiny or too dull. I didn't expect much because of the price so I'm actually happy with it... I dropped a star because of the repairs I had to make. I just wish I had read all the reviews before pouring the sand in and making a mess!"
3,"Great, but not so great","It came exactly as stated, except all four legs were off by the time I got it. I would have just glued them back on, but one was missing totally.Otherwise this is an excellent give. He loved it and ""plays"" with it daily."
4,"Oddly, this works.","If you stop, take a deep breath and move the sand & stones it is relaxing.It is not an immediate fix and it requires you to work at shutting out everything else.If you do that, this will relax you.Additionally, you can make some nice designs."
2,poor quality,"Disappointed in this item. The tray bottom was not attached well to the sides - doesn't hold the sand. Also, the rocks are dull and all one color. Rakes seem to be OK."
2,"for your own sake, do not buy!!!","When i got my package i openned it and everything was great, but the sand holder is so cheaply made, it was broken before i even touched it. Now i have to go through the hassle of finding the right one maybe at a home goods store.. and there is no way you can have a refund which i wanted, because they take off the sticker you use to send it back. I basically paid for sand rocks, and a cheap rake. Not worth the money! Made in china, the table is not stable at all. I hope nobody buys this, because they certainly dont deserve the money. Quality over quantity. -Rant over-"
2,Not so thrilled,"The tray was thin and cheap looking and although it was supposed to have rocks included, there were none in the box. The only part of it that was half-way decent was the rakes. Because I was on a time constraint I kept it, but I did have to go buy rocks and I also bought more sand because what came with it looked like salt."
2,"Short good text, overwhelming background noise and old film.","These two short tapes consist of a brief description of 50 years of white-red relations, treaties and conflicts. Because of its brevity, there is little detail presented. The text is interesting and appears to be factually correct. The presentation is relatively unbiased, and is quite interesting. It would make a good audio tape. The extra loud background music and simulated battlefield noise sometimes drowns out the text. The visual portion consists of old photographs, presumably authentic in detail and clips from old grade B movies which are quite far from authentic. These are rerun from 6 to 10 times throughout the presentation and, of course, have no bearing on the text. Except for the extreme brevity and the overwhelming background noise, one can ignore the visual effects and derive a worthwhile understanding of many aspects of the period of the Indian Wars."
1,do not buy this piece of c--p,"do not buy The Great Indian Wars. the same hollywood movie stock played over and over, sometimes without even turning down the borrowed movie's audio. i couldn't concentrate on the narration, and that was a shame because the narration was very well written. the narrator also had a fine voice and read his stuff superbly. i felt sorry for him, being assocaited with something that went so bad through no fault of his own. someone ruined this ""documentary"" with the choice and use of the visual footage.i even tried turning off the picture and listening only to the narration but the silly dialogue and old-western music score made trying to listen only to the narrator sheer torture. i only wish i could have given this film a rating it really deserves. MINUS FIVE! the fact that they used 2 tapes when the entire length is only 96 minutes proves to me that the intent of the producers was only to flim-flam the public into thinking they were getting a lot for their money."
1,The Great Indian Wars 1840-1890,"This is without a doubt the worst video I have ever watched.The videos picture could not tracted without jumping lines and wiggling screen it was painful for me to watch.The movie itself was out of focus.They used old black and white movies"" indians meet the cavalry "" to illustrate the action and pencil drawings of the indian chiefs while they spoke of them. There was one man speaking with a monotone voice.After five minutes it became very boring to watch.The movie was put together very poorly and hard to watch the pictures had very little contrast, and hard listen to.It was so bad I could'nt retain any of infomation,my mind kept wandering off. If you enjoy being bored,and having your ears and eyes assulted by this low grade quality picture this movie is for you. Reviewed by Paul Phillips"
2,You get what you pay for I guess.,This radiator seems to be very cheaply built. Its aluminum and plastic! It did not even come with a radiator cap. How cheap can you get?
5,a welcome return to form,"I want to second everything said by Mr. Grimlan with respect to this album and Les Baxter's output in general. Although I am extremely fond of Les's 1940s-50s work in all genres, some of his 60s pop things (specifically, VOICES IN RHYTHM and COLORS OF BRAZIL/AFRICAN BLUE) continue to leave me cold. This 1970 album, however, exhibits none of the shortcomings of those earlier ones - the lukewarm performances, the generic guitar/bass work or the uncomfortably passe doo-wahs. No, this abbreviated QUE MANGO! has real energy. It crackles - and not only is there not a bad track, but some of them (""Que Mango"", ""Tropicando"", ""On a Warm Night"", ""Felicia, My Love"") stand easily with the best of Les's work from his great 50s albums. Highly recommended even as it is at under 24 minutes."
1,Not working correctly,"I purchased this a month ago and found out this was not working correctly.I had it pugged in and it went on by itself, then another time I could not control it with the remote....Not happy in Lynn, Mass"
2,NO GOOD,"Bought this for the Christmas lights 1 for outside and one for the tree,works great EVEN WITH EVERY OTHER REMOTE YOU HAVE WILL TURN IT ON OR OFF,AND DRIVE YOU CRAZY!!!!THE CAR REMOTE/ GARAGE/ HANDY SWITCHES ALL TURNED THE LIGHTS ON"
4,Tequila a mexican treasure,"If you ever wonder how tequila is made, find out what an amazing process it is. Buy this book.Full of incredible rich photographs, that depict the everyday beauty of Mexico."
3,Had great potential,"There's no doubt the authors know their subject. Sadly where this falls short is the lack of a good editor to massage the text into greatness. If you appreciate good tequila, this is well worth reading--great history and background on the region. It's a shame they missed the opportunity for creating the definitive book on the subject. Better editing and good photography would have made this a 5-star book. Still, it's a lot better than the other pithy books on tequila with froufrou recipes and questionable history."
5,YEB!,"Nab tis iz e bok. I'v beeen dwinkinking teakilyafar sum time and I cun say itz the bast dwink tohavb! Nah I meen et! I'b no dares Beer and Wienbat nothfing beets Teequilla,NOFING!

1,Not happy with seller,I ordered and paid for an 8 ounce product and received a 4 ounce product. Now the seller wants me to take a picture of the product and the bar code and send it to them before they will make good on it. I've ordered from them before and there have been issues. Never again....What a pain.
5,BEWARE!,"In this book Agatha Christie refers to the murderers in Death in the Clouds, the Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Mysterious Affair at Style and the Mystery of the Blue Train, so make sure you have read all of these before you read this one, our your fun will be spoilt!Dumb Witness is one my top ten favourite Agatha Christie novels. Dame Christie has expressed the character of Hastings better here than in any of the other seven novels in which he appears. It is also one of the most amusing.One thing I enjoy about this book is that we are given a fair crack at the whip - everything that Poirot sees we see, there are no last minute envelopes arriving (which often irritates me). His explanation is convincing.Go ahead and read it! But don't forget to read the books mentioned above first."
3,good...,"This a good book, but not that great. An old woman writes to Poirot, informing him that she fears that one of her own family may murder, one attempt had all ready been made. But the lady is delayed, and when Poirot arrives on the scene, the woman is dead. Who did it? This plot wiil keep you reading till the end."
4,"An average Poirot book, plus a dog!","I am a Poirot fan, so I enjoyed this mystery as I expected. The little dog in the story is precious and adds a new element to the plot. I don't remember an animal being featured this way in another Christie book. While I was reading, I kept thinking that the plot reminded me of another Christie book but couldn't remember which one. I thought I had guessed the killer but I was wrong. Which makes me like it more!"
4,Great fun!,"The Dumb Witness of the title is a dog named Bob. A dog who loves his mistress and possibly is the only witness to her murder. If it was a murder ... Hastings and Poirot work together, trade quips and get on one another's nerves as they work through a neat collection of suspects. This isn't high art, but it is quaint and well crafted. I recommend it."
3,Not the definitive work on 1911's...,"Quite honestly I found this book mediocre at best. It's something of a ""Jack of all trades, master of none"" effort. If you're a big 1911 fan then you might consider this book, but if you're not, spend your money elsewhere. One good point, there are detailed examinations of 23 different kinds of 1911 pistols which is great if you want an STI or an Auto Ordnance, but where are the various Colt models in detail?"
2,"Not a ""Bible"" by any means whatsoever","This book says it is a ""look"" and that what it is. By no means is it the Bible or even a beginner's guide to the 1911. Half the book is just gun reviews, which you can get anywhere. Another 1/4 or more has to do with competitions and things like that. If you want to learn about the ""use, care, and maintenance"" of the 1911, look elsewhere. The internet is better than this book."
2,Left me feeling wanting.........,"Somehow, if I had spent the time reading the book a little before purchasing, I wouldn't have bought it. He talks extensively about competition rigs, rules, etc. which I had no interest in. I have yet to see a gun rag writer talk honestly about guns. Ever see a bad review in ANY of the gun magazines?"
4,This book is great,"Buy this to learn more about your 1911 pistol. I really followed some things written here and presto!, My gun worked better. (with the help of my gunsmith)Knowing your pistol can save your life and money. And knowing your pistol means that it is safer to handle and carry."
5,Model 1911 Lovers,"An excellent addition to the library of any Model 1911 owner. The book deals with the history, shooting and maintenance of this iconic firearm."
3,The sequel was actually better,"This book is a solid ""okay"". The Volume 2, however, was vastly more interesting to me. Still, not a bad addition to any 1911 afficianado's bookshelf."
3,Book is good,"Good book on care and maintenance of the 1911, found it useful and being a 1911 fan, it deserves a place in my private library."
1,"Flimsy materials, potentially dangerous item",Even though this is rated to hold up to 2000 lbs. I would not trust it to last very long. The nylon and ropes that this comes with are clearly very low quality. Some of the ropes even showed signs of fraying straight out of box. Cannot recommend this item.
4,Good for kids with sensory issues,"We got this for our son with sensory issues as an alternative to a more expensive therapy swing. If you use it without the cupholder and foot rest, it works just fine, and since it's hanging inside, we don't worry about wear and tear. Just make sure you have a swivel joint at the ceiling for it.Hanging in a kids room, it will generally fall very close to the ground, so be sure to shorten the cord to a higher level for a taller child."
5,Greatest Box Set Ever !!,This box set is a MUST-HAVE for all Elvis/Orion fans alike. Booklet is fantastic. Songs are great . Can't wait till the next Orion box set !
2,Wabash 1938,This trilley has been opersted only a few hours and the drive system seems to be slipping already. Not durable and not recommended.
3,Good Remote Control Features,"This is a good general-purpose tripod for Sony Handicams. The remote control handle is a must-have feature for decent videos. With practice, slow zooms are possible.My biggest complaint is that the unit does not have a fluid head. It can be hard to get smooth pans without some jerkiness.However, the overall features and utility of the remote handle and a reasonable price, make this a good buy."
5,great to use with action shots or beginning photographers,im glad i bought this item i could have use this years ago as i love to take pictures and video my kids sports.Darrin & Jackie
5,Nolde Ignites Passion,"I'm an always learning watercolorist and this book is great inspiration for letting more passion flow into my everyday and my art. the book arrived in 'very good' condition, as requested. Nolde's landscapes and flowers are unparalleled in their joy for color and sense of spontaneous energy and expression. i'm really glad i did the market buy and let Amazon find the book over a few months."
2,A padded short story disguised as a literary novel,"The kindest description of this book would be that it is well-written and quite pointless. The plot is paper thin and all the characters (with the possible exception of Mr Hilditch) are either two dimensional or borrowed from other, more superior, works. The much-touted plot twist, when it finally arrives, lacks any irony and seems contrived. William Trevor is best known as a short story writer and this book is essentially a short story padded into a novel. As a well-written, mildly diverting, piece of light entertainment it would have been acceptable, as a prize-winning piece of high literary pretensions, it is not. Dickens, Poe, even Highsmith have succeeded much better in what Trevor seeks to achieve."
2,"Good basic story, but many flaws","I found the basic idea of the book to be excellent and very true to life, however, I cannot say the same for the characters, Felicia in particular. Beyond her frustration, we are never privy to any of her emotions. What did she think of her plight? Why did she never worry that Johnny, her lover, might reject her? I feel that the author made a mistake by never writing in Felicia's viewpoint during her scenes with Mr. Hilditch. We certainly know many of his feeling and thoughts concerning Felicia, but never, never any of her thoughts about her sinister friend. ...The character of Mr. Hilditch is very well developed, unfortunately more so than the main character. I felt that too much of the book (one quarter) was devoted to Mr. Hilditch's downward spiral. It almost becomes a completely different story.As a previous reviewer mentioned, the author's practice on going back and the forth between past and present was confusing."
4,Darkly Poetic- No Wonder Ireland has had 4 Nobel Laureates in Literature,"This book deatails the travels of Felicia, a young Irish girl, who finds herself pregnant by a rake and travels to England to find him. We know from the beginning that she is on a fruitless task - she has been used, abused and discarded. On her search, she is 'befriended' by a creepy man who portends trouble and worse for Felicia. The book is peopled by religious fanatics, homeless eccentridw who come alive during the night and it is always surprising to recognize the naivity and innocence of Felicia. Despite the horrors and depravity that the book allude to, Trevor never gets into the bloody details that an author such as Stephen King savors. The same monstrosities are here but they are alluded to and left to our imagination, our ability to call forth our own personal monsters and give them literary life."
5,Arrived in great,Book looks great everything that was promised and arrived in great time too. Thanks! Will enjoy reading it and sharing
4,a page turner that leaves an impression on your heart,"Trevor does an execptional job of captivating the reader and telling the story from the two main characters (Felicia and Hilditch). One cannot help but feel sad after reading this novel. All involved appear to be victims at various times and on various levels. Felicia, the victim of death (her mothers) and a jilted lover and Hilditch. Hilditch a victim of his mother and his need for ""friendship"".Trevor will keep you reading and feeling throughout the book. Do not expect to feel good after reading this novel. A great book for a book group discussion."
4,A difficult read...but a great book,I found this book to be a bit difficult to read because of the author's habit of jumping from past to present with no warning at all. I did however find the book to be very exciting and have not been able to get it out of my mind since I finished it.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a suspence and is looking for a change of pace. My only recommendation is to read it slowly to keep from getting confused!
5,"Excellent software, but NOT an audio CD","Amazon needs to fix its info for this product - it's not an audio CD. It's a great package of software that has helped me bulk up my vocabulary and get a better pronuncation in modern standard arabic. I learned arabic grammar a while back, but found that its hard to communicate without a growing base of vocabulary to use. THis program is helping me do that. Love the clear audio recordings!"
3,A disappointingly simple tool,"This is a decent tool for lower-intermediate Arabic students. It's basically just a series of vocab lists, sorted by theme. You can scroll through the lists in English, Arabic, or transliteration, and there are good audio recordings of the pronunciation of every piece of vocab. Also, there are notes on some of the words that provide a deeper understanding of their meaning and usage, e.g. proverbs or common phrases that contain the words.The frustrating thing is that there's not really a way to tag the words you know and pare the lists down to the ones you don't know, and there are no drills or quizzes built into the software. You also can't build your own lists, of either additional vocab or of selected tough words from the existing lists. So an application like RapidRote with built-in quiz functionality and with the ability to create your own lists is a little bit better.I would love to see these folks add some more features and flexibility to the next version."
5,sorta wonderful,this is what wilco would sound like now if they had not turned into radiohead. first 6 songs are as strong as any record in the last 10 years.
5,The BEST PUR cd.,"A must have for any PUR fan, it is if full of classic songs such as ""Lena"", ""Prinzessin"" and ""Drachen sollen fleigen"". Great cd."
3,Sizeable and sloppy,"The mug's pretty enough, despite a visible vertical seam from production. No insulation for hot drinks, so watch your hands and don't nurse too long. The outturned edge may cause some dribbling, but mine has carried me through dozens of winter nights and summer sunbathes. Brings out the beauty in iced tea."
3,These break too easily,"I fell in love with these mugs as soon as I saw them, but it was short lived. I got 6 of them and 1 was broken when I received the box, and since I got them a short time ago 3 of them have cracked. they look really thick and durable, but they don't last long. I am very disappointed."
1,ripped off,"was very upset that this DVD did not specify that you could not play it in the United States. Why was it on Amazon, USA. False Will not deal with this vendor ever again and will make sure my friends and colleagues are aware of it.."
5,A timeless and memorable anthology,"Compiled and edited by William F. Buckiley, Jr., the Treasury Of Classic Children's Literature is an anthology of enduring stories for young folk, painstakingly selected and compiled by William F. Buckley, Jr. for their lasting appeal across the generations. Works by Jack London, Lewis Carroll, Rudyard Kipling, Mark Twain, Thorton W. Burgess, Palmer Cox, and others, are embellished with black-and-white illustrations in this timeless and memorable anthology which is a welcome and recommended addition to school and community library Children's Literature anthology collections."
1,Don't like it,"I bought the Soyo 24 inch monitor based on a $100 reduction in price at Office Max and what appeared to be a review on the internet. Previously I had a Viewsonic 17"" LCD monitor which was pretty bad too. The Soyo has a bad stand that is supposed to be adjustable, but I could not do it and had to prop it at an angle with a book. The User's manual is nearly incomprehensible. The speakers have to be the worst sounding ones I've ever heard. I am going to repack and try to return it and buy something better ever if I have to pay more."
4,LIvely Experimental Synthesizer Jazz with Global Fusion,"This CD has instrumental experimental Jazz and near trance synthesizer pieces. Some of the rhythm patterns have a Latin flavor and feel very danceable. Others remind me of chill out lounge music. A few selections have some subdued vocals that are more part of the background rather than the foreground. I enjoyed the selections and liked working with them in the background. I have not heard the other volumes in the series and so I cannot compare them with each other. My only reservations about this collection is that the mood between selections is not always consistent, some are more mellow and some are more lively. But the mood of the CD is more consistent than a lot of collections I have heard. Some of the pieces are more experimental than the others and are interesting studies. Two of them felt slightly dissident to me, but the experimental sound still felt worth hearing."
2,The worst of all the Future sounds of jazz series...,"this all sounds crappy. fauna flash's drum n bass tune sounds so generic and boring that it makes everything else look bad. the tunes here are not of the same quality of other cds in the series like vol.5. i say skip this one, its really boring and with the exception of like one song by tosca everything else is $hit."
5,CUT IT UP DEF,IT'S OLD SCHOOL JAMS!!! I HAVE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED FOR THIS CD FOR THE LONGEST. I HAVE FINALLY FOUND IT!!! NOW I HAVE TO PURCHASE IT.
5,Paperweight,I purchase this for a friend who is a big fan of super girl she was really impress with the details lived it
3,Nice But.....,This is a good idea but what you cant really tell from the pictures is that the only puzzle part of the contraption (for lack of a better word) is the string with the rings. I thought the whole thing was a puzzle like the old iron ones I used to have. Good idea but if you want something that will really puzzle them I would go for a different model. On the plus side it looked really nice when we brought it to dinner and put it on the table and the perplexed look on our friends faces were great!
5,"Excellent idea, went over perfectly at Christmas","This gift for my brother at Christmas got more attention than any others. My sister and I hid upstairs for a good 20 minutes trying to get it together, which for us was fun. ""No, that doesn't look like the box. Let me try."" ""Maybe the German instructions make more sense"" (neither of us read German).Our time was well-spent: my brother and his girlfriend admired the appearance, loved the caddy, until my brother became suspicious and announced ""I think it's locked in"". As my sister and I sat smug, several people gave it a try, and we heard a resounding chorus of ""I know some people who absolutely must have this."""
1,I do not recommend this vacuum,"We bought this Emer Galilieo vacuum cleaner for about $400 more than one year ago. The retractable cord broke after a short time. We had to send the vacuum to NJ to get it repaired by using the warranty. After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on-off button was broken as well! I called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one. This vacuum is very powerful, however the handle (hose) is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use. By considering its high price, I guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner."
4,Classic New Age Disc!,"Wow, I'm surprised to see this available here. Horizont's ""Silent Moon"" is a classic New Age album from 1986. It was readily available for a few years, then totally disappeared; this disc is EXTREMELY hard to find now. This album is a good mix of new age and ""space jazz"". Most of the synths used here are now obsolete, and they sound great. The title track is definitely the outstanding track on the disc, but others are great as well. If you were to compare to other artists, it would be kind of like combining Vangelis, Jean Michel Jarre, and Dave Grusin (the more jazzy tracks are Grusin-esque). Overall a good listen and a great representation of the greatest era in new age music. Too bad the cover art is not available here, it's awesome. If I get a chance I will scan my copy and post it. Grab this while you can, you may not see it again for a long long time."
5,Imagine a cross between Tom Clancy and Tom McGuane,"A simple premise ... a wealthy American businessman's only granddaugter dies of a cocaine overdose. He decides that he's going to kill everyone who had anything to do with it, starting with her boyfriend and ending with the head of the Columbian drug cartel. Along the way yachts are wrecked and burned, secret love affairs are revealed, priests are consulted, and plenty of smartass dialogue is emitted. Buckley obviously knows what really rich people are really like, and in addition to having a great plot and memorable charactes, it's full of consistently interesting observations. A good book"
3,Unfortunately - mediocre,"I bought this book to see if my fond memories of C. Buckley which were jolted by his latest effort ""Supreme Courtship"" could be calmed and massaged.This book started out like a fine walk in the woods and then got into somewhat muddy grounds and then a bit swampy and finally quicksand. Sorry. Three stars is the best I can do and I don't even feel that I want to justify it."
4,Wolverine Anime,"Fans of American Wolverine must remember this is an anime not a Marvel Comics release. I will admit the voice of Wolverine is a little unexpected being not nearly as gruff and deep as what we have came to know. Also, yes He looks like a skinny little punk, but this is how most male anime characters look! Besides these minor complaints I think this was a nice departure from the ""kiddie"" style American cartoons seem to hold on to. So give this a try and wait till 5 or so episodes in to form an opinion."
2,not what i expected,being a wolverine fan ; this is nothing like i expected. really don't like the drawing or storyline. looks fake.
1,Very poor vision of Wolverine,"I have seen an episode of this show and all I could say is WOW, what a travesty. This show is completely not Wolverine. First Logan is Canadian not Japanese, short not tall, older looks middle aged even though much older not like a teenager. Voice acting is poor. This show is the William Shatner of Wolverine, extreme over acting and over dramatized action sequences. This is supposed to be Marvel Comics Wolverine not a Wolverine DragonBall Z. If they want to make a good Wolverine Cartoon keep it on par with the comics both in the character models and story, and use voice actors that have worked in the past, and if you really want to do Wolverine Justice make it a Mature rated cartoon and show Blood in the battles."
5,Another Fine Parsifal Recording,"There are many very fine recordings of Parsifal in the catalog. In fact, it's difficult to find a poor performance. The highlight of this production is the magisterial Gurnemanz of Kurt Moll--possibly the best rendition ever. He is ablely supported by the poet of the baton Rafael Kubelik and a virile James King as Parsifal, also possibly his best recorded role ever. The recording has a wide and deep sound stage with excellent sonics. I enjoyed listening to this excellent studio rendition. Wagnerian singing of the highest standards.This recording is near the top of my favorite stereo studio editions along with Karajan's also fine rendition on DG recorded the same year as this one(1980). For the historically minded, I would recommend Krauss's 1953 Bayreuth live air check or Knappertsbusch's 1951 Bayreuth live recording on Decca. Karajan's live Vienna aircheck from 1961 on RCA is also interesting, but sounds older than the earlier recommendations."
4,Good Basic CO Alarm,"Simple, straightforward , and no problems in the few weeks I've had this. Very good price. Good basic protection. I now prefer First Alert over their major competitor, after a problem with that companies' detectors , and their customer service did not seem to care at all. First Alert's customer service appears superior to me."
5,First alert plug in Carbon Monoxide Alarm,"I was very pleased with my first alert plug in Carbon Monoxide Alarm. I like it because it is not that noticeable. It's not an ugly plug in and I like that. We received it in the time that they said it would be delivered and I would not hesitate to order again from Amazon. We have ordered many, many things from Amazon and have never been disappointed with their service.Thank you,Mary Lou Pantuso"
3,"Died after nearly four years, just so you know.","Well, don't know if it would have worked, but not having CO around is good, right! After not quite four years of sitting on the wall, it started warning beeps out of nowhere, when there wasn't a possible source of CO around. Tested it on a few different walls and in another building and it still beeped, so its apparently malfunctioning.I guess it got bored after four years. I hope it was working properly all this time."
1,"Not UL Listed ""what's up with that...""","I bought this first alert CO alarm for my home in Wisconsin.When I started to read the instructions I found that this product is not UL list! How can a safety item like this not be UL listed.I did some research and found out first alert changed testing labs to save a few bucks and do not use the most well known UL. What's up with that...So I returned this CO and purchased the Kidde KN-COB-DP-H Plug-In Carbon Monoxide Alarm. The Kidde unit cost less too, so I saved a few dollars! Always pays to READ THE FINE PRINT."
5,"Easy to use, trusted","After opening the package, I simply plugged this in to a wall socket (making sure that it is not near a heating source, gas, moving air, dust or sunlight). I tested it, the alarm rang loud and clear. A red light lets me know that it is functional.I feel better having it in my house."
5,Easy,"Easy to install, just find an outlet in center of home. Product is made by first alert too which gives me confidence in operation."
1,Defective product,"We bought this item twice. The first time, it was defective and wouldn't work (it made a dull sound all the time, and no additional sound at all when put in contact with water, as per the test described on the instructions sheet), so we returned it to Amazon (thanks for your excellent returns policy!) for an exchange. When the 2nd item proved just as defective, we got our money back. Don't waste your money on this junk -- buy something more expensive and substantial."
5,very good product,Great product. i gave this product to my son and i feel much better that he and his family are safer from carbon monoxide. thanks.
3,CO 2 Detector,This co2detector met my expections.The only thing lacking is a battery back-up. Of course I knew this when I bought it.
4,Fist Alert CO600 Plug In Carbon Monoxide Alarm,"The Carbon Monoxide Alarm met what I needed for my rental house. I like the idea of the plug in vs the battery only type. The Alarm has a battery back-up, which covers a power failure.The new law requires the CO Alarms for rentals and homes. Reasonable price too !"
4,Does the Job,I just plugged it in and it's on the job. Perhaps it would be more assuring if it had a digital read-out of level of monooxide in the air.
2,weird notification beeps,This went off in the middle of the night after my husband and I had had it for several years. We had to look up online the directions because it didn't have a clear beep for a warning and for a battery replacement. It was ridiculous. I would not recommend it. I want one that clearly tells me when to vacate the house and call the fire department.
2,"My bad, but theirs too","It did not even occur to me that a plug-in CO detector would not have battery back-up, which is my fault for missing that. However, what the?? I mean, they ALL should have batter back-up. This one has to go back."
5,No Brainer!,"I chose this alarm because it was the easiest to use. Just plug it in and that's it. I have a gas fireplace and was told that I needed a carbon monoxide detector. Plugged into a regular outlet, it has a dim light to let you know that it's working and you can test the monitor at any time to make sure it's ""alarmed."" Hopefully, I'll never have to see how well the monitor works in an emergency but I feel safer knowing that I have one."
4,Carbon Monoxide Alarm,I feel that these are a necessity especially if you live in colder winter climates where you may have the windows closed for a few months.I prefer this model as it plugs in to an outlet rather than battery operated units.I found the models through Amazaon were several dollars cheaper than stores around my area.
2,WARNING: This is not an instructional video!!,"I bought this video from Lullabot as soon as it was released. I've managed several Drupal projects and am now diving in to development myself. I was very disappointed, this video has no instructional content whatsoever. It is a very (very) high level view of what Drupal is. I give it two stars for good production value, only.I am hoping this is the first in a series of videos that will dive deeper into Drupal."
4,"Solid tripod, great deal","Easily the best tripod I've ever owned, including some considerably more expensive ones. The only problem was with the remote. You must turn on the video camera before connecting. When the camera turns off automatically, disconnect the wire, turn on the camera, plug the remote back in. What a pain."
2,tripod sony,"This tripod is out of production, although I bougth it because the price and the need of lanc connection for my camcorder Sony DSR PD170, was the only model with a reasonable price. The desadvantage is that it can not hold stablity for the camcorder, too light, not enough hight, and the locks for the vertical and horizontal moves are not good enough, you loose in trying to loose or tight the buterfly nuts. The only advantage is the remote controller and the price. I hope Sony can improve it like the next level but with more confortable price."
3,Sturdy but lacking in certain key areas,"This tripod is sturdy and is taller than most which is important to me as i want my camera to be at eye level or higher. The cheaper versions with remote are shorter although lighter.The single biggest problem with this tripod is the remote control for the zoom. It is reverse of what would be intuitive. Pushing the buttom IN zooms OUT; likewise pushing OUT zooms IN. I even tried to rewire the switch but didn't find a way to do so. I had soder iron at the ready, but the fine ribbon cable was too delicate for the necessary surgery to make me rate this tripod high. While its no fluid head; the pans and tilts are fairly smooth. Smooth enough for what I use it for which is capturing my kids' sporting events.Lastly, for the price i'm willing to put up with the backward ergonomics of the zoom. You just have to 'think' about your zooms more than you would prefer to.Great price from the remanufacture site..."
3,Doesn't consistenly keep good connection,"For some reason the power plug seems to be just a little off in size. Doesn't consistently supply power unless it is held in just the right position. Luckily, the USB connector and the power plug are connected by such a short cord that when the USB connector is plugged in then it pulls the power plug to where it needs to be. Works either plugged directly into Karma or plugged into the dock."
5,A great collection of songs on this karaoke disc,"1. Suerte - Shakira2. Si Te Vas - Shakira3. Ojos Asi - Shakira4. Te Aviso, Te Anuncio - Shakira5. Objection - Shakira6. Tu - Shakira7. Sombra De Ti - Shakira8. Que Me Quedes Tu - Shakira9. Te Dejo Madrid - Shakira10. Octavo Dia - Shakira11. Ciega, Sordomuda - Shakira12. No Creo - Shakira"
3,Just ok...,"The locket has a very nice appearance and there is a inner plastic cover that holds the photo in nicely. The negative is the very little use of silver in this locket, there is absolutely no heft to this, it almost feels like it is made out of foil. Opening the locket is very difficult and it felt like it would just break because it had to be pried on so much to open. Being somewhat handy I was able to adjust the latch to a more reasonable level."
1,False,"I have read alot of Krishnamurti,Probably the greatest teacher I have came across,But this book is no better than Humpdy dumpty or the Bible, If it is K which I very much doubt he must have been very immature to write this hollow meaningless stuff.His other works are consistant and valuable, among the most valuable words ever written,This book has less wisdom than the average person on the street"
4,Spiritual guidance from the East,"This is a delightful little book of wisdom. It is a great read for anyone searching for greater spirituality in their life. It is not really a book of any particular religion or Denomination. It is just a bit of guidance from a great master. Krishnamurti does not try to convert anyone. He merely nudges people to seek aims greater than themselves. I find it a quick read that can also be read over again numerous times. In fact, I suggest it be read through once quickly and then referred to sporadically to absorb all the wisdom. It is a spiritual reference book that holds value over time."
5,High quality and so cute!,"We love this set -- we used it for our daughter, and now we're using it for our son. Sumersault is rated highly by Baby Bargains, and this set is well worth the money. It's held up really well for us over almost three years. FYI, it goes well with the Pottery Barn ""classic stars"" rug in blue."
1,OMG! this Movie is too wierd to be watched sober.,"I think it deserves the one star. maybe even 2 if I was drunk.... but I was'nt! Oh God, how I wish I had been. I can't tell you why I kept watching after the first half hour. I guess I expected it to become something .. ummm good..! quite an unusual film. if you watch it please tell me what you thought of it and what you think I missed. I don't watch Mexican movies ever..! & now I think I know why.... they make my brain all mushy and then it pours out of my ears and I fall over dead and brainless! OMG.. and the last 15 minutes... I could have slit my wrists, it was that bad! Sorry, Have I said too much.?"
4,Historical Account of RCA,"A comprehensive history of Radio Corporation of America, from its formation in 1919 to its pending merger with General Electric in 1986. The CED VideoDisc system is only briefly discussed towards the end of the book, but this book puts it in the perspective of the corporation as a whole."
4,The Book's Title is Self Explanatory,"This is a great history book on the great Mongol Empire. It clears up a lot misunderstandings and superstitions about the supposedly horrible Mongol barbarians and gives a reliable account of their rule in this time period. It covers Temujin's (aka Genghis Khan) beginnings to the end of his forebears rule. It has pictures from the past and of re-enactments of Mongol cavalry - you will rarely find this elsewhere. The Mongol Empire was a militaristic nation, so this book lacks on the military strategy and warfare of the Mongols. Only the basics are covered."
5,Strait as an arrow,"Great product, good price, I have shot them several times and never had anything go wrong. I did robin hood one of them but that was my fault."
4,First crossbow kill,Been trying to make my first crossbow kill for a couple of years. Never could make it happen then I got a new Horton Crossbow and some of these carbon express arrows with muzzie broad heads and one shot one kill. The shot was a 28 yds and the deer ran another 50 yds and crashed in the woods. She did manage to break the shaft off when she fell since I hit her in her shoulder and instead of a clean pass through. Still accurate arrows.
3,Not bad,"The vest quality is not bad. The price was very good and it looks nice. The vest is reversible, but the inside is smooth and does not have the same vest look as the outside, so I wear it only one way."
3,not bad,"This is not $125 quality as it indicates, more like a mid-tier clothing store quality. the down is about 3/4 inch thick, not as heavy as it looks in the picture. it runs a little big for the size. Still not bad for the price I paid, but not a steal either."
3,this book needs two separate ratings...,"one for the projects and one for the art. my rating for the projects would be a TWO. While it has some good ideas for making art in your journal, it is called ""Making journals by hand"" and the instructions for making journals are terrible. things like, ""get a stack of paper and take it to kinkos to have it bound."" NOT how to do it yourself. This book will NOT help you learn to make books. It also has a lot of terms that it never defines, and if you're not an experienced book maker, you won't know what they mean.On the other hand, I would give a rating of FIVE stars for the art and inspiration. the pictures and journals are absolutely gorgeous. They're too small, though, and you want to see everything closer.But, since this book is called ""making journals by hand""... it is NOT helpful for that, and so I give it three stars."
2,Skimps on Content,"While the journals in here were really beautiful, it doesn't look like the author put a lot of effort into explaining them. It only took me about an hour to read this book and, even with a few creative ideas(mostly from the pictures), the general content was sparse. Some of the shaded sections on the side looked like space filler (for example, one on ""themes"" describes a travel journal's purpose as ""chronicling your travels""...no way!). It bothers me when writers use pretty pictures to try and pull off the appearance of a quality book. Flip through this book in the library to get some good ideas, but don't expect thoughtful written advice."
2,Doesn't live up to title,"While this book has a wonderful visual collection of stunningly beautiful books and journals, it offers virtually no guidance on how to ""make"" them. The advice on putting together a complicated book with non-linear pages is limited to 3 steps, with no list of supplies and vague instructions. Poorly edited, there are many grammatical mistakes or typos. Buy this book for inspiration, but not for instruction."
3,"A Visual Treat, But Needs More Content","I enjoyed what there was in this book, but the generous use of white space and extended discussion on how to make your own books left little room for the subjects of most interest to me, namely the appearance of artists' journals and suggestions for making visual enhancements to a a journal.The ideas there are very fine, indeed, but for the price and number of pages I simply expected more ideas. I'd recommend checking this book out of the library rather than actually purchasing it. I don't think it will grow on one as a reference."
5,Wonderful Ideas,"I found this book to be extremely useful. The techniques were all new to me. The one that I am going to try first is the wax resist. I am a little worried about the other techniques that use solvents - I don't know where to buy them, and I don't want anything unnatural that is going to hurt my body. Overall, this is a lovely book. One department that does need a little bit of expansion is making the journal itself. However, I already have a blank journal that I bought from a bookstore beginning with Bor (they offer great blank journals CHEAP) and I am just going to use the techniques. Cheers!!"
2,journal making?,"I bought this book wanting to learn how to make a journal. This book did not show the basics. It was a waste of money, the author seemed more interested in presenting cute ideas and making pretty pictures than teaching basics."
3,Transmission cooling fittings not correct,"Nice radiator. Fit well, however the transmission cooling lines on my 98 C1500 w/ a 5.7L are 3/8"" however the fittings on the radiator are 5/16"". I had to buy two 3/8"" to 5/16"" inverted flare transmission adapters. Bought them at O'Reilleys for $6.51. Amazon web site confirmed this was a fit for my truck. Not a huge deal, but it delayed my repair and added some cost."
1,Failed after 6 months,Purchased this radiator 5 months ago. It fit perfectly and performed well for 5 months. The side tank seam started weeping last week. This week it is leaking a lot. I expected this to last much longer. I will purchase another brand next time or go to a junk yard and get one from there.
2,For collectors only!,"This CD only contains 2 songs, both of which are available on Madonna's first album. Definately only for those who can't stand not having any given Madonna cd for their expansive collection."
2,Not my type of book,"I just couldn't get into this book. Right from the start, it seemed like the author was trying to hide something from the reader and that annoyed me. Also, it contained too many long descriptions. Not my type of book."
4,Funny movie,"This movie is chock full of slapstick comedy so if you don't like that, you won't like this movie. However, it always makes me laugh. I love it!"
1,Same old junky print!,"Was hoping that this would be an upgrade to the many versions I have bought over the years. Sadly it is not. It is taken from the same horrible print. Decent movie, but baaaaad quality. Let the buyer beware! This is the item I bought. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YVX9/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
5,great fun for the whole family,I have loved Lewis and Martin since I was a child and now I share the fun with my children. My 5 year old loves the hilarious stunts Lewis does and the soda machine scene must be rewound and played over and over. He has tears in his eyes from laughing so hard. I highly recommend for the family.
2,Good Times Video...Skip it,"What Dean & Jerry fan does not know of this movie?My intention is to save those of us collectors time and money.The Good Times Video version appears to have been recorded from a vhs - that was itself recorded from another vhs without Time Base Correction - about 10 times.It's presented as Academy Standard 1.37:1 (original film aspect)Yep - that bad. Perhaps it was better than nothing, but now that something has hit the market, do yourself a favor, skip this version."
2,Dean and Jerry on a Low Budget,"The slow-paced ""At War with the Army"" (1950) was Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis' first starring feature - a bargain-basement military farce that separates the team for much of its footage. Some nice moments (the ""Going My Way"" parody remains priceless), but not enough to justify the endless 93-minute length. One of the comedy duo's weakest efforts."
3,"It's worth watching, but...","I have to admit I was a little disappointed in this movie but considering it was a first it wasn't a bad attempt. We did get a few laughs, but not as many as I had hoped for.All three of my children are die-hard old comedy movie buffs and this one only held the attention of the oldest (14-year-old). The other two drifted off to more interesting activities.I'll definately watch it again but it'll never rank in my top favorites I'm sorry to say."
2,Hmmmmmm...,"I guess I didn't find this CD memorable, as I couldn't even remember what it sounded like. There were no particular pieces that jumped out at me and cried ""Dance to me."" Overall I was not that impressed."
1,JUNK! (says China on product),"When will people stop digging for the lowest possible price? I would have paid three times this price to have a quality product. After three pumps the check valve that holds the air in the rocket failed. You would push the pump in and all the air would get sucked out of the rocket when you pulled the pump back out. Then the mounting nipple snapped off when releasing the rocket from the clamp. Never worked once! Would like to find one that works, but they all look the same."
1,Can't get it to work,"I used to love these rockets back in the day when I was a kid, so I got one for my 11-year old son. When it arrived, it looked like the ones I had as a kid, but was obviously of cheaper quality. Then again, it cost only a few bucks. Problem is, when I put the water in and then snap close the end of the pump, all the water leaks out! This happens whether the rocket is pointed up or down. The rocket is totally useless and we had to throw it away. Too bad, those rockets sure were fun a long time ago..."
1,Memory Lane??,"I bought 2 of these hoping to show my kids one of the toys I had growing up. Wow, these are straight CRAP. Why would someone produce a product that SUCKS this much?!! The clip that holds the rocket to the pump doesn't hold the rocket on. The O-ring is a dried, hard, brittle piece that doesn't seal. Then, when you get past ALL that crappy-ness, the pump shaft will either pull completely out, bend like a pretzel while pumping, or leak water into the pump itself! I got three launches out of 2 of these. I was more disappointed than the kids were. Boooooo!"
1,Ron,"Not as pictured. Doesn't seal well for the launch and so it is pretty much worthless. I had the one pictured when I was a kid and was pretty excited to order and now left with disappointment. Order what you see and you may get something else and cheaply made. Maybe should have bought this back in 2006 when it got better reviews. Amazon, please take this off your site!! It indeed is less than a quality product and your company is deceiving those who buy."
2,Old School Rocket,Launcher broke after a couple of flights. Not surprising for the cost. These were popular when I was a kid and this model WAS enjoyable while it lasted.
1,Junk,"Wanting to share my water rocket memories with my kids, I decided to try this rocket out in spite of all the bad reviews. I agree, it is junk. While the whole thing is cheaply constructed, the biggest problem I see is with the pump. The valving is so defective it simply will not pressurize the rocket. Even though I was very gentle with the pump, it came apart after only a couple pumps and the rocket never flew. I'd love to find a good one of these but this one is not."
1,Don't bother.,Boring. What was I expecting? Something that would give me insight into my own abilities to heal self and others. This didn't do it. Especially since it wasn't in English.
5,Provides excellent knowledge about Tibetan Medicine,"ITem was shipped new and arrived in excellent condition. DVD provides a beginning knowledge about the almost lost art regarding Tibetan Medicine. As indicated in the DVD, there are very few doctors that still retain this knowledge and practice. Excellent overview but it is all in subtitles and obtaining any of the medicines/herbs seems as though it would be difficult. They take a wholistic approach and specialize the medicines for the person. You would need to go to India to get a diagnosis regarding your condition. Too bad it is not closer."
4,Dense with knowledge,"This film is filled with informative interviews which is great. This film is also subtitled. Not so great. Definately worth an afternoon. Watch this film with intention because it is filled with teachings, visual cues and subtitles."
4,The knowledge of Healing,"The knowledge of Healing was a great explanations of Tibetan Herbs, treatments etc...that truly work, better then our deadly chemicals...they have been used to heal anything and everything since 5000 yrs and more; their correct diagnosis of the different pulses is very effective...treating illness with heat or cold treatments...along with prayers...how can anyone go wrong..."
4,Works like a charm,I recently broke my foot and were put in a FP Walker boot. The 1st couple of days were no fun with the skin on the back of my heel rubbing. I could not get a normal sock on due to the swelling.These socks rock! Easy to put on and padding in all the right places.I am definitely buying some more.
2,Not great,"I guess these would be good if you had foot surgery and wanted to place something lose and protective over bandaging, but not for under a boot cast. I was under the impression these would be tall enough to almost reach my knee. They only go about 4"" above the ankle. Very wimpy, probably wouldn't hold up to too many washes."
3,Pictures would really improve this book,"While this book provides great descriptions of the positions, there are very few images for reference. For one to truly practice yoga, posture and alignment are extremely important -- if trying these positions without a guide, you may not receive the same benefits. Ask your yoga instructor to go over the proper postures before you practice them on your own."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"This is totally different from the ""classic albums"" series of DVDs that have come out which I love. This is a ""classic album under review"" which basically has a bunch of fat old guys talking about how great AC/DC is. The clincher for me was the fact that they had an AC/DC tribute band on to play the guitar riffs from this album. A TRIBUTE BAND?!?!? I'm sure that was great fun for those guys to do, but I think the people watching would rather see the actual band playing the songs. This DVD went on WAY too long and only had little snippets of the band playing live. Way too much filler for me and not what I thought this DVD was going to be. I do not recommend it."
1,Come on.............,"We know Back in Black was one of the best albums in history...do we really need some ""experts"" to tell us this ??I'm a big AC/DC fan I would not buy this...."
1,Unbeliavable....,"So they release a DVD to say how good ""Back in Black"" is (as if we needed to be remembered of that...) and they put a photo at the front cover with SIMON WRIGHT in the line-up, instead of Phil Rudd! Wright joined the band THREE YEARS after the recording of ""Back in Black"".This fact alone is a very good omen of the real intentions of this product: to make easy and fast money and offering nothing new about this classic rock album. Useless."
3,"""Late night drive in film...long on flesh, short on story""","It's your typical 70's late-night on a Saturday drive-in theater experience;shot on grainy 16 mm film, with a relatively lame ""plot"", it was an excuse to show lots of female flesh;THAT... it most certainly does !Lots of skin, highlighted by the beautiful, red-haired Sharon Kelly, who would achieve adult film success as Colleen Brennan. Her scene is smoking hot, and is awfully close to hardcore porn...It's fun to watch late at night, and is so typically 1970's.It's OK. 3 stars."
3,Ok,This book is alright but I feel that the author shouldconcentrate more on the plot and dispense with the puns... they'regetting irritating... I started reading xanth when I was 8 and was hooked instantly- I couldn't wait for the next book to come out! But now I think the books are getting worse and worse... frankly this is sort of a disappointment... I much prefer the earlier books.
3,Enough with the Adult Conspiracy already!,"This is not a bad book, but it would have been better if the author would concentrate on story-telling and humor, including the inevitable puns. I am no prude. There is nothing wrong with sexual innuendo, or outright sex for that matter. I read plenty of books that have sex in them. That said, I think the whole Adult Conspiracy sub-plot is getting way out of proportion in recent Xanth books. No one reads Xanth books looking for titillation. Also, why the thinly veiled social relevance? Anthony is always complaining about the ""cri-tics"" and I begin to wonder if he is responding to them by force-feeding political correctness into the stories. There is plenty of fiction, even fantasy fiction, on the market that addresses serious issues. Xanth books are marketted as being light entertainment, so why not provide that? Despite all that, I enjoyed the book. I just would've enjoyed it a lot more without the coyness and PC attitude."
5,Just when you thought it couldn't get any better in Xanth,"Now look, I know Piers Anthony is a great author. I've read his Incarnation of Immortality series, all the Xanth books, the Mode books, and the Apprentice Adept series. But this, I have to say, is the best of the bunch. What do you get when you cross a young black Mundane with a magical talent, a 130 year old man who was transformed into a tree, three kings, and a mess of zombies? Believe it or not, one of the best surprises to come into Xanth in years, thanks to the devious plotting of Good Magician Humphrey, Clio the Muse, and everybody's favorite elf, Jenny of the World of Two Moons. For all of us raised on fairy tales, this one beats them all."
5,The most complex yet potentially important yet!,"I have just finished this novel, and must say that it is very complex, yet sets up countless options for the future of Xanth! This book is a story of love, hate, prejudice, potential adultery, and a complete denial and rejection of the Adult Conspiracy! If you love the Xanth novels, you MUST read this book!"
4,"Nice, handy, and lightweight philosophy dictonary.","Nice, handy, and lightweight philosophy dictonary."
3,Could be better,"Having been dx'd with AML I wanted a comprehensive but understandable text to keep near by and refer to as the situation warranted. At first I found it helpdul but then I had more complex questions and the answers were not there. Specifically I needed a better explanation of all the CD's and their effect , affect, I never know which to use, on my leukemia. I also needed much more information on blasts and what different levels indicate. I felt that side effects of chemo and drugs needed to be addressed more thoroughly, and GVHD certainly needed much more space.I would say this is a fine starting point but does not have all the answers. Oh, I found the anecdotes nothing but space wasting"
5,"The answers to a serious, life threatening disease",I have a friend who has a family history of this disease. He wanted the most current information so I ordered it for him and he found it very valuable.Doc
2,Earland below average,"This 1991 Muse Records CD (out of print)is among Earlands weakest B-3 performances recorded. Standard tunes like ""Unforgetable"" and ""Europe"" (yes, the Santana hit) is arranged and played like elevator music and goes nowhere...But there are moments where Earland shines and cook's predictable with his combo like on ""Sheila"" and ""Kicker"", but thats all. Even Earland's sidemen like Eric Alexander on tenorsax does not lift the overall performance quality. Thia is not capured misic, this manufactured music. For Earland collectors - put this CD in your shelf and start looking for Earlands recordings on Prestige, Milestone and Savant/HighNote"
5,New Mexico meets Iraq,"I have very little to add to these semi-enlighted reviews (above).However, of all his albums, I prefer the immediacy and dialogue here between these masters of string & percussion.We're blessed here in Land of Enchantment to have Alhaj in our midst, and on Music faculty of state university, UNM. It's a secret, but he also has a delicious sense of humor..."
4,inspiring book on an important topic.....,"I also read this book when it was first available last year as an e-book, and I definitely found it inspiring. Body image + sexuality are inextricably linked, and I found Miss Dodd's personal accounts of her struggles to be fascinating and ultimately inspirational. Buy this book for your teenage daughter!"
5,I've told half the women I know about this one!,"There are very few books that I recommend to other readers, because I assume that everyone has their own tastes and their interests -- especially in the area of ""self-help."" But, this book covers such a far reaching subject, and I think just about every woman I know could benefit from it. This woman talks about body image in regards to sex, dressing, jobs, long term success, even friendships.It really is inspirational, and it changed the way I looked at my waist, hips, thighs, butt, you name it!"
3,Not about food so much,"This was an enjoyable film that examined the dynamics of a varied group of family members dealing with the death of a loved one. Sadly though, I was hoping for something more along the lines of ""Like Water for Chocolate"" or ""Chocolate"" or ""Eat Drink Man Woman"". I wanted to see Chinese culture as experienced around the dining table. Still, all in all, I'm not sorry about this purchase."
1,BIG THUMBS DOWN,"I rented this thinking it would be an interesting subject on American-Chinese tradition here in the U.S. But I was wrong, it was a total disappointment. The story and its sub-plots are too contrived. The script is very formulaic; even adding a twist at the ending was typical and intentional - just so for audiences who likes a twist in their movies. Any viewer wouldn't get involved watching this film. Basically this is about a group Chinese-American siblings who has hang-ups with themselves and among each others. Set in the affluent neighborhood of San Francisco, it portrays an embarrassingly rich family by showing the amenities of the matriarch's sprawling extravagant house. Tennis, a dip in the pool, jacuzzi anyone? Jeez! I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","The set looks very nice and elegant. I have no problems with the glasses, it's the shaker that bugs me. There's a bit of leak when you try and shake it. But worse, when the glass gets wet it gets really slippery, so you have to take extra care, not to let it slip out of your hands.I'm probably going to buy another shaker and just put mine away for looks or something."
3,4 Fabulous 1 Loser,The glasses are absolutely fabulous. Very 1950's....retro.They have texture with the ribbing and are very one of a kind.The Glass Shaker is the pits....the top doesn't stay on very well and there is a great likelyhood that it could fly off.But the value is still there for the glasses.
2,Aesthetically pleasing but not functional,"While I like the looks of this set a lot, with its retro feel, I find the shaker to be in need of a design overhaul. Every time this is used (and it's been used by several people so I don't think it's a user problem) it spills while pouring! This has been very frustrating to lose good top shelf vodka because of poor design. I had to go out and purchase another shaker because of this problem so I would not recommend this set."
4,Very Nice,"I got a similar set (3-pc with shaker and 2 glasses). I agree with the other reviews about the shaker, it leaks a little bit. I suggest getting another shaker, but keeping this one around as a back-up OR wrapping a small towel around the leaky seam. I like the texture of the shaker and glasses. It's classy and not so overdone that it's tacky."
1,Beware,"The set is cute to look at, but as far as actually using, it is terrible. The glasses are fine, but the shaker is so hard to use, I actually took a chunk out of my finger trying to get it open to refill it! I've never used it again."
2,A booklet- not a textbook!,"At 60 pages,this is over-priced and not a course for adults. As basic instruction for those 10 and under, it is probably okay. For anyone who even doodles while talking on the phone- forget it!"
4,A real gem!!,I took a class from Bruce McIntyre in 1968 or maybe 1969. I enjoyed it so much and buying this drawing book brought back memories of what I had learned then. He makes drawing much easier than I thought it was but showing easy things to use to make the picture come to life. A friend borrowed my books from the class and I never got them back when I moved so I was elated to get the Drawing Textbook from Amazon. YEA!!!
5,Required for Art class,Drawing Textbook by Bruce McIntyre is required for an art class I'm in. I like how it laid out and easy to follow away from class. I love that I was able to find it on amazon.com so I could get my own copy. It helps that I don't have to try to follow along with several others at the same time.
5,Alaskan Beauty,This book was more than I expected...the pictures are lovely - really makes you want to visit Alaska but if you can't you can certainly enjoy this book.....
2,Inexpensive but poor quality,"The set was shipped with a carrying case that was covered in an oil-like substance and either the oil or the case itself smelled horrendous. Also, the punches are very dull and not uniformly sharpened (or dulled, however you look at it). I have difficulties cutting through even thin, soft silicone sheets. Sharpening them with a rotary tool helps, but I feel I shouldn't have to do that with a brand ""new"" product (which I am sure is actually repackaged). I can't imagine using them for metal, let alone most rubbers. Despite the very affordable price, I would NOT have purchased this set for the above reasons."
2,Not for Metal!,"Received this in great time- I have no problem with the seller:-)BUT! The inside of the case lists all types of materials this can cut including metals, which is what I got it for.One punch through soft 26ga copper sheet and the edges of the punch bent & in some areas, flaked off. The second disk I cut did it in completely. I had to file all of the edges and it probably would have been easier to cut the sheet with shears.So, not for metals.However, I can see it would be great for leather, paper & plastics.To me it was worth the money spent on the chance that it would actually cut metal disks."
1,Not good!,I purchases this set for simple craft projects...mainly to cut card stock and cardboard. I tried hammering the punches with my 12 oz. hammer and it didn't go through the card stock. Got my husbands big beefy hammer...it still will not punch through thin card stock. I am very disappointed in this product. Glad I didn't pay a lot...complete waste of $
3,SE Hollow Punch,Pretty decent tool to use around the house with reasonable price for an average quality. It's OK for home use.
1,Dull and dirty,Well I don't usually write reviews but I feel the need with this product.1rst. They were caked with mud ...what's up with this?2nd. They are dullI guess they can be sharpened ..we'll see
2,BEWARE OF SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN!,"I really dont want to give this product a bad rating as it is just a simple tool that does what its supposed to. But it has a serious safety flaw/problem!!:The kit came with no instructions, so I was figuring out how it worked, and as I was turning the screw on the side of the barrel, the sharp pointed 2 inch pin needle inside the barrel shot out like a projectile dart. It was spring loaded and the screw is what held it in.Luckily it wasnt aimed at myself or anyone, because it could have caused serious injury. After the pin shot out I was left feeling very disturbed that this tool could have taken out my eye out.So, I feel compelled to warn and advise others who might be buying this tool set."
2,West Coast Avant Garde,"Listen to the sound bite before you buy. I didn't, but I should have. This is way to modern for me, I like cool west coast jazz, but this is sort of Ornette Coleman meets Karlheinz Stockhausen--very modern in tone. If that is your bag, the album is for you, otherwise pass this one by."
3,long legs,"the product is nice, my 4 years old daughter love it, the boots are looooong, but over all is ok, don't wash it at tha washer machine, do it by hand. the fabric is extremely delicated. buy it you and your daughter will have a lot of fun"
3,just okay...,"I purchased this costume for my 3 1/2 year old daughter because she wants to be a purple ""action hero"" for Halloween and this is the one I could find with some purple on it. The costume is cute, but when I took it out of the package, it was all stuck together. Half of the purple that she wanted so badly came off the skirt when I pulled the costume apart. Also the boots are way to high. My daughter is taller than the average and has long legs - the other reviewer was right the boots go high, right up under the shirt, not like what was shown in the picture. I think this costume was very cheaply made for the price, but my daughter loves it so I guess it is okay."
4,pretty good,"Got this through Amazon for my daughter's superhero party. She could hardly wait to put it on. The quality is OK - some parts (like the skirt) have gotten stuck together and the color has come off a bit. For a costume though, it'll serve a good purpose, and provide hours of fun. The boots a really high. My daughter is tall for her age, but the boots go all the way up (and even under) the skirt. Just FYI."
4,Useful history,"A useful history of the last days of Soviet rule and the early days of democracy in Russia, told through the stories of several, mostly prominent individuals. It provides a nice portrait of what exists, but lacks deep analysis to answer the question of why."
5,Fantastic Account of The Soviet Union,Highly recommended. This book not only gives a stunning history of the Soviet Union but also a much more personal account of the people who live there. This is truly a must read for anyone interested in Russia and the problems it faces today
2,Printing is WAY too small!,Book is over 600 pages and the print is so small it was difficult for me to try to read so I returned it. Perhaps if it ever comes out on Kindle I would try again.
2,Lenin's Tomb : The Last Days of the Soviet Empire,"this book should be a text book for those studying soviet history. the author assumes that the reader is very well informed--certainly better informed that i am. he drops names that are mostly meaningless and impossible to put into context! his vocabulary is beyond the college level. do you know the word ""ramify""? i didn't.but the positive side is that remnick has done remarkable research. he has put himself into situations that have put him at risk. his descriptions are graphic and frightening. he is courageous.i read the first half, but couldn't continue. it is part of my too hard file."
5,IT'S A KNOCKOUT !!,"Mr. Remnick has given us a masterwork. He seamlessly meshes intimate portraits of Soviet citizens within the larger landscape of the last days of the Soviet Empire. He has a rare ability to blend the micro and the macro in a soul-stirring narrative. This is a profound work that is filled with compelling stories. Lenin's Tomb is so superb that even those who avoid ""history books"" will relish it. Could not more highly recommend this book. The scads of glowing reviews below are all well deserved."
4,unable to put it down,"great book with lots of great anecdotes and small, personal biographies of those power capitalists who entered the Russian business scene as the communist era turned its last page."
5,A respectable work of history,"This is a very revealing and perhaps most revealing account of the last days of the Soviet Union put forth in a concise manner for the reader. It is smooth flowing, vivid in its descriptions and captured the mood at the time in such an authentic way. The reliance on interviews gives a lot of credibility to the narration and the portrayal of the character in the the situations they found themselves in. The society as a whole is bared for he reader to understand and the system's shortcomings are exposed. I read The Union Muzhik the other day and from it, understand the hopes of Perestroika and Glasnost that the demise of the Soviet Union failed to bring to the people."
3,Good Story Teller But One Must Be A Detective To Gain Insight,"Remnick tells a good story (or, more accurately, a series of short, personalized stories) of the last days of the Soviet Empire. I was looking for insights ... and they are there ... buried under much narrative. He receives rave reviews and gives a good, first-hand, eye-witness account of 'what' happened. But I struggled to find out 'why' it happened and as such, I struggled to finish the book."
3,big and sturdy but...,"The binder I received does not have covers that meet. The back cover sticks out 1/4 inch or more from the front cover when the binder is closed. Hopefully, this is a one off and the others are not the same."
5,"Huge, high-quality binder","I bought this binder to hold a 700+ page anatomy book that was published unbound, and it probably could have held at least two books that size. It's huge. The pockets, D-rings, and opening mechanism are all top quality.When measuring how much space you'll need for this binder in your bookshelf, backpack, etc., remember that the rings themselves are four inches, so the binder is even wider, close to five inches. The side of the binder with the rings will non-negotiably need that much room."
1,Broke within the first week,"I bought this binder for my son who started middle school. Withing the first week, one set of rings did not close properly and now my son has to carefully go through his notebook so the papers don't fall out. Everything gets stuck at the point where the rings don't completely close. Poorly made product."
5,Same dependable Avery quality,"I keep all of my equipment manuals and owners' guides in these, and needed to add a volume. The others were bought in 2005, so I was worried that I might not be able to get the same durable quality. I worried needlessly. These are up to the usual Avery standards."
1,Probably the Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"I have a relatively high tolerance level for bad flicks, but this one is beyond tolerable. If you check the credits after the movie it appears as if the producer hired his family and friends as the actors. Summary (no pun intended): Horrific acting (I could have acted those scenes better than the so called actors; Frightful script (who talks like that anyway ""The zombies are breaching our stronghold, I would advise that we seek an alternative egress route in order to address the impending conflict""; Brain Blending effects: Nothing like a karate kick to the face that missed by about 6 inches yet knocks the zombie through the window. My review is more interesting than this movie. Give me a camcorder and an Amazon makeup kit (shameless plug) and I could have done this movie. There is nothing redeeming about this... NOTHING!"
2,Come on is this Real??,You figure zombie movies have been out for at least 20 years and to this date we still can't produce a low budget zombie movie with better actors. The dialogue was good the presentation sucked. it was like they were reading the dialogue instead of experiencing it. The plot was good as well. This movie had all the elements of a well made zombie flick but no one was chomped only the token Lesbian Black chick. Good try but I wanted more.
4,A jolly fun scare ride - perfect for Halloween!,"""Z"" is the follow-up feature to ""Nightfall"" by Tempest. It's a jolly fun scare ride throughout, as you never know where the undead creatures (I hope that's not a spoiler) may be lurking. It reminds me of a Saturday afternoon matinee horror flick - full of thrills and action, but also with dashes of humor. ""Z"" is a film just perfect for Halloween - a relentless chase and pursuit as the characters try to survive, not knowing which way to turn. Also, interestingly, the creatures are very old-school - you'll hear and smell what I mean!!"
3,good effort.,"For a movie that looks like it cost 250$ to make, It was ok. typical zombie film. But a good film for people who anything zombie."
4,More Z's Please!,This was a cool fast paced indie zombie movie. Would defiantly recommend friends and family to see this film. Would like to see what this company could come up with if given the opportunity to do a second or third zombie film. Oh and the disclaimer at the end of the film about no zombies being hurt during the filming of the movie was pretty neat too.
1,dont waste your time or money.,lower then low budget with horrible dialogue and acting. Two six year olds could have done better with a couple of kindergarten actors
2,The DVD has missing segments!,"In the past, our family has purchased three videos from this series and LOVED THEM! This DVD advertised SIX segments on its cover and on Amazon's advertising, but only three interrupted segments were on the disc we received. In the end, the contexts for the stories are missing and so is one title of each segment pair intended to support the educational message. Has anyone else had this problem or do we have defective discs? We are returning ours to Amazon ASAP. and hope to get corrected discs."
2,Poor quailty,Item sizing was not consistent. Had to make modifications just to wear it and make it fit. Cheap and torn before could even use it.
2,ok,"This costume is very flimsy, but the bright pink color is great. The only problem we had was the elastic on the mask was too short to fit my daughter's head. So I cut it off and used glue dots to glue the mask onto a pair of sunglasses that I pushed the lenses out of. Perfect fit and much easier to wear!"
2,not too durable.,"This was great as a Halloween Costume. however, after my daughter tried it on, one of the straps on the leg covers broke and the mask was too tight. Good for a one time use. My daughter enjoyed it."
5,Bat Girl with Flare,This Costume was just as it says. Was a great buy. The material was stretchy so it moved easily with my active child. No complaints.
5,Pink Child Batgirl Costume,"Hello,This pink batgirl costume is the best and so perfect for this halloween! It's made well and the topic in kindergarten this past week has been all about bats!!! Daughter cannot wait to wear it and decided to become batgirl since she's already been a princess and ballerina before.Sandra M."
3,Cheap!,"What do you do where your daughter begs for a Batgirl costume for well over 2 months before Christmas? You find her one, of course. BUT, where do you FIND a Batgirl costume in December? Amazon, of course. What if you don't want to spend much money? You buy one of the cheapest on the market mostly because it is pink, and your daughter LOVES pink. Why an OK rating? The boots are entirely too small to fit, the mask looks more like The Noid than Batgirl (please tell me I am not the only one who remembers Domino's Avoid the Noid commercials?), oh and it is about as flimsy of material as they could use aside from piecing it together with paper towels.So... the ultimate question ... was it worth the money? ...Um, YES!!! Daughter was ecstatic that Santa brought her what she wanted, which was more important than it being high quality or even fitting properly."
3,"Very cute with speedy delivery, but...","I ordered this for my daughter to wear to her superhero-themed birthday party. It was delivered much faster than they estimated, which was fantastic. And despite reviews about it's quality I found it to be very durable, and it really is adorable. However, the sizing is incredibly inaccurate. I bought her a small (4-6), and while at the time she wore a 5 or 6, this was much too short and tight on her. She ended up having to wear tights under it, which she didn't care about but it bugged me that she wouldn't get much wear of out of it beyond her party, given how much it cost."
2,Cape is very small/ fabric is very thin,The material is thin thin thin which I expected from this kind of costume. The mask didn't really hold up for one halloween party and one night of trick or treating. The worst part was that the cape in the picture is big enough for the girl to hold with both hands but in reality it isn't that big at all. Also the velcro that holds the cape on didn't even hold up on Halloween night. Disappointing
4,Fabulous,The costume came fast and fit awesome. My only complaint was with the shoe coverings. They broke easily and would not stay on my daughters shoes so we ended up not using them.
2,Expect what you pay for,"The price was cheap and so was a majority of the craftsmanship. Also, the belt was not in the package and we bought it new."
4,very cute,This was super cute on my daughter and she absolutely loved it. Everything fit nicely. The only thing I did not like about the costume was that the second time my daughter wore it the fabric had already started to stretch and tear. It would be nice if they would make the material more durable for the kids costumes.
3,Cheap Flimsy,The costume is made from cheap thin material along with the mask almost feels like paper mashe. But my dauther loved it.
2,Wouldnt buy it again!,"I bought two of these bat girl costumes for my two daughters. The masks started falling apart after the first time wearing them. The material was so cheap it literally fell apart!!! I was SO disappointed! By the time Halloween came I had completely redone the masks and stapled the silver belt back together.I have never rated anything before but I couldn't help myself, I want people to know what they are buying."
2,Wouldn't recommend,"The sizing of this costume was fairly accurate but it very cheaply made. After only a few wears, the mask and belt both broke. I wouldn't recommend this costume."
3,Super cute but doesn't last,"Positives: This costume is extremely cute and my five year old daughter LOVES it. She even won 2nd place in a costume contest.Negatives: The mask is meant to be tight fitting and has elastic to pull it tight. The downside is that the material is so flimsy that the mask began to tear within about 5 minutes. This was a size medium and she is a very small five year old. Regarding sizing, the package says ""medium (u.s.a. size 8 - 10) for 5 - 7 years."" Well that makes perfect sense. The washing instructions are also interesting: ""Wipe clean with damp cloth. Line dry. Do not wash. Do not bleach. Do not iron. Do not dry clean."" That's nice. A costume you can't iron that arrives with a million wrinkles. A costume for a child that says ""Do not wash."" Obviously I don't need to add that it was made in China."
4,Great Costume!,This is a fabulous costume! My daughter loves it and has had it on every day since it arrived last week. She even slept in it a couple of nights. The other reviews are correct in saying that it needs some mending. We had to reinforce the velcro on the mask and the elastic on the bottom of the boots. After a little stitching it is fine. We also sewed on a small piece of material to the back of the face mask so that it wouldn't stretch any further and tear. This was a fabulous idea. Do it! I only deducted one star for this because the rest of it is great. The material is a durable shiny pink. My daughter is a size 4 and wears a size 9 shoe and the small fits perfectly. If she were a 5 or older I would get the medium. Totally worth the money.
1,Too small and stained,"I ordered this for my average sized 8 year old. I purchased the medium (size 8-10) and it is way too small. It's too short, tight around the shoulders, the boot covers don't cover her foot and the mask won't go around her head (not even close and again she's 50%ile in both height & weight for her age). This size would be better for a 5 year old! And if that isn't bad enough, the cape has a dark (non-removable) stain on it! I'm hoping I can return it w/o paying for shipping considering this item is damaged."
3,1st order too small,The packaging says size small is for ages 3-4. The Medium is for ages 5-7. Did not know that when ordered initially for my 5 year old daughter. The small didn't fit had to reorder for medium.
1,Bad thing,"The fabric is very common, the finishes are really bad, the mask was broken the first time, the layer has no seams, the fabric also is leadership, not what I expected."
4,Great for a Costume,"My neice is four and wanted a superhero costume for Christmas and this is what I got for her.. This costume is not the most durable or made to withstand prolonged wear or washing, however it is great for what it actually is.. The material is pink and kind of shimmery and sparkle. My neice loved it so much she slept in it Christmas eve and wore it all day on Christmas! She loved this costume so very much and I feel as though it was money well spent."
5,Awesome Costume,This is a great costume. All the extra pieces make it really great. This is one of our favorite costumes.
3,great costume,My daughter loved this costume - she wore it to several times. It fit her perfectly- she is a size 5 so we ordered the small. My only complaint about the outfit is the velcro stuck to the cape and ripped the fabric. I wish the fabric were a little more durable.
4,She loves it,"Pink Bat-girl is a hit at our house. She loves to dress up. Costume is a little flimsy but will last through the Halloween season and maybe some dress-up after. Skimpy and thin so plan on wearing something under it. (I wish we had bought a size larger) Don't be fooled by the cape it does not go over the shoulders, only behind the back. It is very cute and my 7 year old daughter loves it."
5,SEAL TEAM TWO,Nice work. Full disclosure. Some of these guys were drinking buddies when I worked in Norfolk . I produced the first TV documentary on SEALS
3,Went overboard with the bird sounds.,"Having grown up in the country, I can tell you that song birds do not constantly chatter away 19 hours a day...Some people may like what they've done here, but I was hoping for the real thing.Very disappointed."
3,barely gets it done,"I ordered this as a stall shower rod. It works - barely.Much better I suspect as a curtain rod.Nice finish, just very lightly made - the word spindly comes to mind."
2,thin,"The picture seems to show a somewhat robust rod, but what you get is a very thin (1/2"") rod. When exteneded to near its mazimum length it becomes very flimsy and will barely hold my small shower curtain without bowing in the middle. I would have expected a little better for the price and the intended use. But, it works and it's black."
1,Item was nice color,"This rod was too flimsy in my stall shower to stay up more than 10 minutes with a curtain. We put it up at least four times and it fell down. I returned it. Color was nice, it was extremely thin."
2,Disappointing,"The pieces that attach to the shower wall are very small. Because of this, the rod never stays in place!!"
5,"Sturdy, stylish rod",This is a great rod if you need if for a little space. It is stylish while being sturdy. The accents on the end bring out more charater than other plain rods. Had a strong resistance so it stays up on the walls. Holds a material curtain as well as a liner and hasen't budged. Love this rod and would buy again.
3,Curtain Rod,"This curtain rod is also used as a shower stall curtain rod. I found it to be small in diameter unlike the plastic versions offered at Bed, Bath & Beyond. It does not twist out for a snug fitting between the walls. I expect it to fall down with daily use."
2,Too Small for a Shower Curtain,"This rod is way to small for use with a shower curtain. I have no idea why it even comes up in the search. It may work for a simple curtain, but I doubt it."
3,"Not one of the better quality tension rods, but at least I can get one in black","I like the fact that I can get a tension rod in black. Too bad this style appears to be my only option. These rods look nice and, from a distance, they have the appearance of wrought iron, but they do not stay put for long. They loosen on their own, causing anything but the lightest curtain to take them down. Also, the little end cap that comes off so you can slip your curtain or rings on is also attached to the end that you twist to elongate or shorten the rod. Not a very good design and they cost about double what they are worth, but if you can get them to stay up, they look quite nice."
2,"Pretty, but not functional","This curtain rod looks nice, but can barely hold any weight. It will only work with sheers."
2,Shower Curtain Rod Review,"Umbra Coretto 24 to 36-Inch Decorative Tension Rod, BlackThe rod is really good looking. However, because it is so thin, the weight of my shower curtain keeps causing the rod to come loose. If I had any idea, I probably would not have bought the rod. However, my shower is at the wider end....so maybe a person would have better luck if their shower is closer to 24""."
3,Disappointing,"As anticipated as a new Technotronic project was, this new single is disappointing. It has some good beats, but fairly repetitive and uninspired. It definitely lacks the creativity and personality -- and influence -- that TT's projects with Ya Kid K have. This CD has 3 mixes of the same song, one instrumental (minus the freestyle overdubbing of Monday Midnite)."
4,So happy to see more Julia Child on DVD,"Why is it so hard for them to put out Julia Child DVD sets? Just when i was about to give up, they put 8 episodes from Baking With Julia. The set is wonderful and well worth the money. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is the annoying menus you cant exit out of, and the fact only 8 episodes were released. Though I am happy to see a volume 2 is released as of March 1st!"
3,Misleading title,"I LOVE Julia, let me say that and have been devouring everything I can find about her. I was very disappointed, however, that the title of this is misleading. I thought SHE would be baking, but it's a series of other people baking and she is standing next to them. I got a copy from the library, wanted to check it out before I bought it and am sure glad I did because I will pass on it. Actually, some of what I remember was contrary to techniques she taught on her videos--the people in the video used different techniques, so if you remember some of hers it will seem a little confusing. Just seemed like an attempt to keep her in front of the camera but really isn't about her."
1,This DVD is not as represented in the description.,There are only 8 out of about 24 episodes from the Baking With Julia series on the DVD. Amazon would not guarantee me a full refund if I returned it since I took off the plastic.Even though I had not viewed it. I didn't notice that it was only 8 episodes till after a tore the plastic off and looked at the back of the dvd. Definitely is not work the money.
1,Sent damaged product,"I received this DVD in a well packed box with another item. The other item was in perfect condition. However, this DVD's case was broken in several (at least 4) places. As I said, the box was well packed and insulated. The DVD had obviously been sent in the damaged state it was received in. Most disturbing is the fact that the damage to the DVD case was so OBVIOUS. Pieces are broken off inside the celephane wrapping that you can see and, when you pick it up, you cannot miss feeling them.The DVD itself skips in several places.Unacceptable and unethical behavior on the part of the sender. They had to have known they were sending me a severely damaged DVD case. It had to have been damaged at the time they packed it in the box.As a result, I was not able to give it as a gift as planned."
5,wonderful,The DVD's are a great addition and compliment to the book. This would be wonderful for any cook from novice to expert.
5,Anything Julia...,"This is one of three videos that comprise the show- about 8 episodes each to total approx. 24 episodes. I don't know how many were in the original show, so I can't say what percentage of it is on tape here. Reading the back covers, I don't see Martha Stewart's wedding cake presentation, although it was in the original show and that was great just by itself. It is really interesting to watch, and her guest chefs go slow enough to be able to reproduce what they are doing. It's good to have the companion book nearby by Dorie Greenspan, as well, so it's written down for you and you can focus on technique. More recipes in the book than on this DVD."
2,Longevity,I was initially impressed with the company and the product. The company ended up to be local which was a plus. The product didn't last a year and I purchased two of them. Both failed inside of a year.
4,Nik comes into the 90's and away from the Pop,"I was delighted to find this newest incarnation after digging about for his other albums/CD's that were not released in the States and having to get them as imports. The guy would be big here with a little publicity. His lyrics are as ususal clever with twists and turns not found in most artists work. The fave so far is ""Billy"" (which probaby could have been named ""Sally Wants"" just as easily). Keep it up!! and keep cranking it out into the 00's!! Valkomen back!"
4,Lyrical and mellow--classic Kershaw,He's grown musically and hasn't lost his talent for interesting--almost arresting--lyrics. Fans of the Nik Kershaw who came to fame in the early 1980s will appreciate this album.
4,Handy Device,"Very compact, well made, helps me level the camera when I set it on sloped surfaces and it stays in place due to the rubber feet. For the price and size it's a great alternative."
5,Very nice design,"It's light, compact, and stable, easy to slip into a shirt pocket, and easy to use. It's great for fairly flat surfaces. From reading descriptions, the gorilla tripod (I think that's the name), while bulkier, is more versatile, since it can adjust for uneven surfaces and wrap around poles etc, but I haven't tried it."
3,Good but there's a better option,"It's a clever design but i wouldn't put it in my pocket. I have a pocket monopod that also works as a steadicam. It's called a readysteady, and it really does fit in your pocket."
5,Good Product,"The material was nice and clean, no rust and flat. Drills nicely and was easy to work with.Highly recommend."
4,Basic cookbook,It's a good basic book- no frills. Since it's my first Korean food cookbook I have nothing to compare it to. It has been helpful especially the glossary which describes terms.
4,Great Vegetarian//Vegan Cookbook!,I love Korean food but I had found it very difficult to find a good Vegetarian Korean cookbook until I stumbled onto this terrific book. I found fun and easy to prepare vegetarian and many vegan recipes in this very unique book.
4,mostly for collectors,"I enjoyed A.F.'s other books enough to buy this one, although it is not nearly as practical. The sections on where to buy clothes are not only out of date by now, they are also designed for people who have far more money than most. Actually, I don't know why this book was published originally since, if you have the money to shop at these stores, you probably already know about them. It almost seems like a matter of credentialing, but who knows.I would buy one of A.F.'s other books if you are just looking for a men's clothing guide. However, if the subject matter really interests you, you will find that each of A.F.'s books covers much of the same ground, but in slightly different ways, so that there is value in reading all of them, including this one."
2,"Fasion, Fops, Faux Pas","I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This book is more like the cliff notes to a book about men's fashion, tradition, style, etc. The other half of the book is relatively useless - unless, of course, you're a millionaire & world traveller. The prose is humorous at times becasue it's so pretentious - bordering on the effeminate a la Niles Crane. Still, there are some very imporatnt basice male fashion rules established by history and tradition, discussed in this book, which one wishes were adhered to more regularly. The first half of the book is serviceable, but not authoritative. Flusser comes off somewhat foppish and the picture of him on the dustjacket would lead me to question his taste in, if nothing else, haircuts! I would consider a better book, with far more lavish detail and illustrations to be ""Gentlemen : A Timeless Fashion"", only recently published."
1,Dreadful,"3/4 of this book is where to shop, with locations noted in Chicago, Houston, Florence, Milan, NYC, Vienna, etc (but not Beijing, Shanghai or Hong Kong). The rest is spoiled by a pompous, overbearing style that makes it unreadable."
2,Overrated book,"I bought this book a year ago, mainly because of its high ratings. But I was disappointed. I read it once and I found the style of writing outdated and the content not so useful: many addresses where you should buy things, but how useful is that? I don't live nearby these places, and I want to learn WHY you should buy certain things so that I can decide for myself what is good to buy and what not. Such info is given only very briefly."
1,Terrible,"What if you live outside of New York? This book isn't applicable for anyone outside ""The City."" Buy a book from John Bridges instead."
4,An ageing shopping guide for dandies,"If you're seeking information on how to tell fine menswear from bad, skip this book and go directly to Flusser's new one.If you're a would-be dandy looking for information on where to buy men's furnishings around the world, buy the book (with a minor caution). Many of the stores in the U.S. have relocated and some have closed.On the other hand, I've used it to find choices in London and Paris that I would never have known about otherwise. And once you've made the initial investment in the measurements, you can patronize many of these establishments by telephone.A number of earlier reviews criticise Flusser for focusing on the finest quality and most expensive clothing in the world. It is, and he does. But for people who do or want to play that game, it's still the best source of information."
4,Dated yet still relevant,"As noted by many reviewers, the clothing fact information is first rate.The second part of the book on shopping and retail establishments is so out of date in 2005 that I really question whether a purchase is worthwhile if retailer information is primary purpose of proposed purchase. A good 60% of the information on establishments in the US and London is totally outdated or the stores have gone out of business.Try the library or borrowing from a friend to see if any of the desired information is still relevant before purchasing. This book needs a serious update."
1,sucks,"I just received two of these guns today and they both broke after about two minutes of shooting, don't buy it!!!"
1,"Sorry, not convincing at all","Well, as a vegetarian and resident of a country seeing exploding diabetic population ( India) I find this approach to diabetes unconvincing.ONE, the emphasis is on animal foods. This has three difficultiescultural prohibitionsbiological concentration of alien hormones, pesticides and antibioticsand last not least, the cost factor of such a diet.TWO there is compulsive testing of blood sugar levels.THREE it encourages dependency on the clinician.Where's the sense of freedom in all this?In my counselling sessions I use sprouted whole legumes, leafy vegetables, NO ANIMAL PRODUCTS, resistence exercises, meditation, family support. It all works fine."
4,A must read!,It took me some time to read this book. I read this first part avidly. Then read bits and pieces now and then. Blood glucose meter at hand I knew much of what he talks about but I did come across great insights.A must read for all people who have a problem with diabetes or better still with pre-diabetes. I do agree with most of all that is written in the book. A big part of the book is dedicated to Insulin usage which if you are not on it yet you might skip it. On the whole the book explains in layman terms the science behind glucose metabolism in our body. Pity there is no mention of any MODY diabetes which is increasingly becoming important as new discoveries are being done how actually what is called Type 2 diabetes is not as it is really depicted.
1,Not Really for Diabetes II,This book is mostly for those with Diabetes one.This is his second book.His first book was a good one and full of useful info for both types of Diabetes.If you are a Diabetic type I then this book is for you.If you are a Diabetic II then buy his first book.I am a Diabetic II and this book was really a waste of my money.
1,Misleading,Blood sugar is only part of the equation. Following this type of diet causes high acidic levels which causes illness. This diet is nothing new. My grandmother followed this kind of plan back in the late 40's because they thought ALL carbs were bad. Today we know that the brain needs glucose to function. Carbs + high fiber leaves lower net carbs. And diabetics need a balance---in fact all people need a balance of healthy whole foods and exercise and fresh air. One more thing; my grandmother died of a massive heart attack on this kind of plan. She was only in her 50's.
5,Great Update!,"As with his first book, this book has more great information for me as a Type 2 Diabetic. Although my wife is not diabetic, we love ALL the recipe's in both books. They have kept my blood sugar in total control and are delicious! Thanks Dr. Bernstein!"
5,The Solution: Properly Titled,"Of the 3 books on this subject by Dr. Bernstein that I have read including his suggested recipes, this is the most detailled and informative. I started practicing what Dr. Bernstein preaches and while it is indeed, difficult at first-especially when you look to revamp your food choices that were learned over your lifetime. After a week, the cravings tend to disappear and I am seeing my sugars come down and I lost 3 lbs. This is just one battle, but if these results keep up, I see this investment into Dr. Bernstein's program is a small price to pay for nutritional and healthy control."
3,DIabetic book,The Best Diabetic books are 30 Day Diabetes Cure from Lifestyle Center of America and the Cook book that you can purchase with it-- All Vegetarian or Dr. Neil Bernard's Diabetes Book Reverse Diabetes Now
3,Not much of a solution,In my opinion not much of a solution. I was not impressed at all. I learned more from a small book I got from the dietician at the hospital than I did this book.
5,The Type 2 Diabetes Answer.,"Of the five books that I've read on diabetes, this is the one that has all the answers. I've been on Dr. Bernsteins blood sugar normalization and weight loss program for 6 weeks and have lost 21 pounds, with no craving for carbohydrates!! The program works because the author(a Type 1 diabetic)hasworked out all the answers from personal experience."
2,"Good songs, but I have heard them all already","The Dissapointed. Why do I need demos of all the songs already on Apple Venus 1. Let's bring on Apple Venus 2, after all, isn't that what we were promised?"
2,thumbs down,"I don't actually own this album, but I did buy Apple Venus, and I'll say this: I hope that this album has the charm that that album lacked. I've never been so disappointed with an XTC album. Why would one buy an album of the exact same songs, except in demo form? A shoddy attempt to extract money, it seems. Shame on you, XTC!"
2,Lame,Recipes are a bit strange and not easy to follow. I wouldn't recomment this book at this time for anyone serious about cooking.
3,The Century Cookbook,It was interesting to read how our ancestors wrote out their recipes. Some of them were interesting I must admit. Some I can never see myself ever wanting to make much less eat.times and tastes certainly do change.
2,These chip,"The price is right and these mugs have a great shape for easy handling. I wish I could say buy these, But...the rims chip very easily. Someone else stated this in their review should of followed their advice."
4,Tea every morning,"I've been making my morning tea in these mugs for several years (no problem with pouring boiling water into them yet), and my mate has been using them occasionally for beer for just as long.They work well for tea or beer - the thick glass and the raised foot help keep liquids at the right temperature, and sixteen ounces is a bottle or a long-steeping teabags worth.My only problem with these is that the rims chip in the dishwasher. I dont' know if that's just my dishwasher, or because I put them next to heavy Arcoroc glasses, but I've found three so far with a slice taken out of the edge. (Which I then smooth down with a diamond wand). Anchor-hocking actually redesigned these to have a less flared lip a couple of years ago, so they may know about this problem. (The new ones chip too, just not as often)."
2,fragile.. fragile....very fragile...,I've had 6 of them for 1 month and one of them got lips chiped out already. (which one of the reviewer already commented that it happens often with these mug). It was sadly tossed out and now I'm worried they will eventually all dissapear out of my kitchen.Keep them apart from each other when you wash them. The slightest touch will chip it out unexpectedly.BTW: You can buy them individually at Bed and Bath Beyond for less price.
5,"Excellent mugs, my guests all agree","I have had 12 of these 16 oz. mugs for some time now and think they are the best. Have had no chips, but am careful that no glasses touch other items in my dishwasher. I have given these for gifts and the recipients have asked for more of them for xmas next year. Thanks for an excellent product."
2,Nice Basic Mug,"I like the size and style of these mugs, they go with anything and look like they'll last a long time.--- EDITED REVIEW --- Long term? not very durable. All but one have broken."
3,Cheap looking but sturdy and does its job,"I was expecting better quality mugs than these(sort of like Snapple drink bottles). Also note that these mugs are a lot bigger in person so beware if you don't have big cabinet space. My husband said, they are sturdy and will hold your coffee and tea. Had I seen them in person, I wouldn't have purchased them. One thing I like about these mugs is its lovely shape."
3,very attractive but not dishwasher safe,These also break when placed in the dish drainer too energetically. I wish this size and shape came in stainless steel (with a lid like a Chinese tea covered tea mug but without any plastic or silicone seals that can soak up dishwasher detergent.)
1,Core Sports Performance,A complete disappointment and waste of time. The narrator couldn't seem less interested; almost as though bothered by the project. Look somewhere else for a sports hypnosis cd.
5,As good as the guy's new book on Horatio Nelson.,"I read Antony Beevor which got me hooked on Stalingrad, and this book is as good as Beevor's. It is also as good as Hayward's new book on Admiral Nelson. Both get my high praise. Scholarly works that are also readable are few and far between, so make the most of this guy's work."
5,impressive book on a ghastly battle,"I enjoyed this book very much. I got it as a gift and have now brought a copy to give to someone else. It is very, very thorough, which makes it ideal for academics, but it is also easy for enthusiasts like me to understand and get absorbed in. And I did. Even though I naturally knew how the Stalingrad battle ended I still felt gripped by the dreadful story as it unfolded. Mr Hayward managed to make the events understable and the characters believable. I felt their frustration and their pain and their growing feelings of failure and terrible disappointment. This book goes well alongside Beavor's equally important study of the battle. Stalingrad enthusiasts simply MUST own copies of both, especially as Hayward's is the first to explain air operations (and brilliantly) and Beavor's is the first to look at the fate of the ordinary soldiers from both sides."
5,A well written and informative book,"I read this book as part of a study I am doing into war on the Eastern Front.I found the book to be excellently researched and well written. For those who are interested in military history and in particular German Military history, I would say it's a must on any good bookshelf"
5,I'm keen on Luftwaffe books and this is amongst the best.,"I agree with what esteemed Professor Richard Overy said in his review of this book: ""This is a model of its kind, which ought to set an agenda for the reconstruction of the air narrative in this and other theatres in the greatest of wars."" But I will go further; this book isn't only or even mainly a narrative. It's a powerfully strong piece of operational-level analysis. It is written in a lively and captivating way, which makes the density of analysis easy to cope with. I rate this work very highly."
5,AN EXCEPTIONAL WORK,"This volume is a major contribution to the history of the Luftwaffe during the Russo-Germano war. ""Stopped at Stalingrad"" is also a richly drawn study of the most important air campaigns in the Eastern Front. Written in an accessible style this volume will be welcomed by anyone with an interest in the WWII. I was very pleasantly surprised by the book and also the quality of its contents. The author did a masterful job of research. Joel Hayward draws on diaries of both key commanders and regular airmen. He also shows that the poorly conceived strategies of Hitler and his buffoon, Goering, dommed the efforts of men such von Manstein, Milch and Wolfram von Richthofen (an outstanding soldier) to come to grips with an impossible situation. I heartily recommended this book."
4,a worthy addition to WW II Eastern Front histories,"I've read a tremendous amount on the subject of WW II history, so very rarely do I read a book with anything new to tell me. This book is in that class and well-written too. The two points I found interesting were the discussion of the original focus of Hitler's 1942 campaign in Russia and the first extensive history I've read about the airlift effort to save Paulus' 6th Army trapped at Stalingrad. He offers original research into 1) the question of just who promised Hitler that the Luftwaffe could sustain 6th Army by airlift, and 2)just how successful the Soviets were in interfering with the airlift. For anyone interested in the history of WW II on the Eastern Front, this book is a must read."
3,One sided,A mediocre historian. Most of the facts he quotes based on one diary. For whatever reasons he trusts more the Nazi published facts and numbers then Soviets. The good news is that unlike the other books he describes in detail the Luftwaffe war.
2,Sufi is inSUFIcient,"Seeking more knowledge of Sufism was my main reason for reading Catching the Thread. The description of Sufism was too scattered over the chapters for me to put the pieces together in a satisfying way. Just one chapter summarizing the basics would have made the difference. The amount of dream material was excessive. Why not just a few extensive case examples. It is impossible for me to judge the quality of the dream interpretation, given the limited information on the dreamers. Most of the applications of Jungian concepts seemed appropriate to me. For those unfamiliar with Jungian psychology, this book serves as a useful introduction."
1,Not authentic,"The title of this video mentions Argentine Tango. Unfortunately, what is being taught on this tape is not authentic Argentine Tango. Not even close. It's ballroom tango. There is a huge difference: in music, style, steps, posture, etc... Don't be fooled by ballroom instructors trying to teach Argentine Tango. The only authentic instruction available on the market comes from authentic Argentine instructors from Buenos Aires."
5,Fun Learning to Dance,"After receiving both of the Librero's tapes (The Big Band Swing and The Latin and Argentine Tango) as a gift, my husband and I cannot believe how easy it has been to learn to dance from them. Neither of us were dancers and Blanche and Emilio have made it fun and very simple for us to learn. Now we can dance all of the dances that we always wanted to, plus have a good time practicing with our friends. We also enjoy the music CDs that were part of the package, as well as the cue cards."
2,Much ado about latin ballroom tango,"This version of tango is not argentine. It is ballroom latin american whatever you call it. Very misleading to call it argentine tango. But if you like ballroom dancing, maybe this video is for you."
5,Great for Beginners!,"I am an intermediate dancer in some dances, and a beginner in others. I found the Librero's Dance Series (both the Big Band and Latin) very helpful in providing and overall understanding of the similarities and differences of all the popular dances. Their Argentine Tango section would be specially good for beginners. Most videos I have seen on this dance can be frustrating and overwhelming. The music CD is not very inspiring but the tempos are very good for practice and it is convenient. I definitely recommend the Librero's Series, particularly for the Beginner dancer."
2,too dark to see the instructors.,"this video has a lot of dances for learning but each dance has only 3 steps so dont expect so much from this teaching video. if you want more than 3 steps then buy videos exclusively for a particular dance. this video will just wet your appetite but will not fill your hunger. also, the background setting of this video is very dark as if you are inside a dark night club so you cannot see the footsteps of the teachers because both of them were wearing black pants that blend with the dark background, terrible! plus the teachers teach from the side of the camera and sometimes facing the camera. this is not the ideal way to teach dance in a video. the teachers should be back to the camera so you can follow their footwork. for the money they charge for this video is not worth it."
2,Tapes don't work for me.,"There are a few things I didn't like about the tape. Firstly, the price is too high. Secondly tape is inconvenient for a spoiled by technology user. It's much easier to work with DVDs and their menus. And lastly, I realized that I'd rather spend 70 dollars on 4 monthly group lessons and learn basic steps and routines of one dance then try to master all by myself while watching a tape."
5,The best series available for parents,"I buy Wiley's guide every year and always find her to be right on the money when it comes to rating the rides, recommending hotels, and giving tips on extras like how and where to meet the characters. What separates this book from the other Disney guides is that it's realistic....the unoffical guide lays out a itinerary that would kill anyone with kids and the official guide is all sugary and light, never telling you how to handle the crowds and the heat and all the other things that are just a factor when you're at Disney World. Wiley hits the middle ground - she's positive and obviously knows (and loves) her stuff but she'll also give you the facts."
5,excellent,"I bought the 1999 version and am about to order the newest edition. I had not been to Disney World in 12 years so I had no idea on what to do and where do go. The book was right on about every detail. I especially like the ride advice for little ones and the hotel recommendations. If you are planning a trip, buy this book first!!!!!!!!!!"
2,this book was a big dissapointment,"I found this book to be very out of date. I can't count how many times I read ""coming in 2000"" and then no info on the subject. I didn't expect this from a book written for 2001. I have the 2000 official guide and it is much more up to date. The only thing I liked about the book is the coverage of non disney parks. This book was a huge waste of money."
5,Geography,Book arrived in good contition as described and in the time indicated. Very happy with the service. I would use them again.
5,fantastic,"This is a wonderful book with bright cute illustrations and a good story. We got one with stickers for Christmas, it was a nice bonus. My son read it 250+ times in the past few years, he is growing up but the book never gets old or boring :o) thank you"
3,Enjoyable book -- very touching,The characters in this book have backgrounds which influence them as the story unfolds. I especially found it interesting to see life as a captive from a child's point of view throughout the story since Dede's son was held captive along with her. I found the ending of the story to be very touching (warm fuzzies). Read it and you'll know what I mean.
3,A bit disappointed,"This is the first book of Cassie Edwards I have read and I am a bit disappointed. I always liked to read about American native people but even for me ( and I am living faraway from States) many things look untrue and strange. First, the picture on the front page - it looks that Thunder Heart has hair on his face. As I know Indians do not have to shave theirselves. Second, I think that such a worrier and chief as Thunder Heart was could not be involved with so many unimportant things, even if he is very,very,very in love. However, the most unusual character is Bill. I believe that such a man as Bill is, could not change so much. Who says that in the end everything must be just fine?"
1,Nice Title!,"It's rather amusing that some harmonica band (or whatever the hell it is) decided to give their album the same title as one of the greatest rock albums in history (Styx: Pieces of Eight). And to Mr. ""Please push sales"" who wrote the other ""review"": I bet your cover art isn't QUITE as good as the incredible Hypgnosis masterpiece of the Styx album. ;-)"
1,Save your money!,"I received this software as ""bonus"" with Photo Explosion Delux. It's terrible. Was easy to create the slideshow and it looked great on my computer. Tried it on 2 DVDs and it didn't play. Tried to re-record it on a CD-RW and it still didn't work! It did run on my husband's laptop, but out of 6 computers I tried it on at work it only was recognized on 1! Very frustrating software. SAVE YOU MONEY FOR SOMETHING BETTER."
3,Solid work!,This is a solid piece of work by a very good band. A few really good songs and the rest are OK. This is a good purchase for fans of German pop.
4,Spiderman Blu-Ray Trilogy,Spider-Man - The High Definition Trilogy (Spider-Man / Spider-Man 2 / Spider-Man 3) [Blu-ray] WE ARE TALKING SPIDERMAN HERE AND ON BLU-RAY IT IS SIMPLY AMAZING AND ENTERTAINING. NOT TRUE MOVIE FAN AND COLLECTOR SHOULD BE MISSING THIS SET IN THEIR COLLECTION. A MUST HAVE TO OWN.
4,Absolutely Worth It !!!!!,"Just as you might have seen in the theatre, BD provides better sound and vision for all the viewers, especially HD resolution does come in handy compared to the old cable TV channels. Somehow I didn't give it a 5-star it's because the box looks kind of damaged outside. The fact that I want to keep it a collection, which a rough look on the ouside doesn't adore me too much. Well...I guess that's the only flaw I could come up with. Besides that, videos quality and sound look just fine to me."
2,"Wait for the ""final"" boxset to be released","This DVD Trilogy box contains the two-disc editions of SM 1&2 and the single-disc edition of Spidey 3. However, 1 and 3 are available separately in 3-disc sets, and I'd be surprised if 2 wasn't given the 3-disc treatment right before Christmas. So, when the 3-disc editions of all 3 movies are available in one box (think Ultimate Matrix Collection), then that will be the one to buy. This box can be skipped."
2,Spiderman 3 was horrible.,"Personally I would NOT buy the trilogy because spiderman 3 was horrible, 1 & 2 where great though. 3 not so good!"
2,Why am I re-buying this again?,"Great picture quality, cool, and Blu-Ray is the premier format for all of its seamless feature interaction, and high storage capacity for more bonus material.... except Spider-man 1 and 2 have no special features (aside from the 2.1 stuff). Great use of space, thanks for all those perks, BR.So, I have to wonder, is it really worth the $70 to pick this up again?"
3,great but disc was scratched,I got this as a Valentines Day gift for my fiance he LOVES spiderman. However the 2nd disc wasn't packaged right & was loose inside the case resulting in scratches! So of course it doesn't play right. Was a bit disappointed.
5,Great Seller,"This 3 package DVD arrived in perfect condition and rather quickly. Had no problems with this seller, very pleased. Always would recommend you to buy from this seller."
5,Excellect Value and Fast Service,"When I am in need of a product I spend a lot of time doing research. Not only are the costs of the product and shipping/handling charges important but also the speed, accuracy and dependability of the company/person involved. I highly recommend this source to be checked out when searching for specific products."
2,Blu Ray for 1& 2 has none of the DVD extras.,"Spider-Man 1 & 2 Does not include any of the amazing behind the scenes content originally released on the DVDs. Why would a studio release two extraordinary FX films of this magnitude and incredible production values on a format that can hold so much information, and fail to include the extras? If you're a fan of behind the scenes content, hold onto your DVDs.Movie - A+. Blu-Ray value for Spider-Man 1&2 - FAIL."

1,Poor quality of wrapping,"I received my ""new"" product a few days ago but it wasn't in brand new conditions. The box had been worn around the edges and you can tell it had been rewrapped in a different plastic cover. When I pay extra money for a brand new item I expect it to be exactly that."
1,"Sipder-man ""The High Definition Trilogy"" [Blu-ray] only works on PS3","I agree the comment from reviewer GWIRTH ""ginnyww"". Somehow these Sipderman blu-rays are not norm. They can only play on PS3. No luck with Samsung blu-ray players, not work with Sony blu-ray players either. Manufacturer needs to check what's going on. I also checked two sets of Sipderman blu-rays, one set from Fry's electronics, another set from Amazon, same problem, so that is not random disc defects."
1,WANT REFUND!,"The movies do not play in my xbox 360 console, which is my only source of a DVD player. i would appreciate a full refund considering i had to wait over 3 weeks just to get the DVDs that don't work."
3,we've all seen the movies,tobey maguire as peter parker is just as bad as elijah wood as frodo baggins. good movies dampened by the leads but strengthened by the rest of the cast.
1,this is not a region 1 set,I bought this set for my husband and brother for Christmas last year then we ended up buying a different set for the movie cash for the new movie. I went to sell this set at used movie retailer and they informed me it was from overseas and possibly a bootleg. WATCH OUT!!!!!!!!
2,Toby McGuyre Spider-Man suffers in comparison,"Lets state the obvious - Andrew Garfield in The Amazing Spider-Man is light years ahead of Toby McGuyre. Toby is nerdy and homely to the point of neurosis. Andrew's Spidey is bookish, but also skateboards in his high school's halls. Agressive, bold and self-assured. Taller, leaner, way better looking; Andrew's reboot of the franchise makes these 3 earlier McGuyre Spider-Man films suffer by comparison"
4,"Great effects, story can be shorten.","Story is way too long, and too many unneccessary scenes that not helping the story at all. It doesn't seem like a Spider-Man anymore. But the effects and fight scenes are awesome, so it balance out."
4,Great value,"I got this for 40 something dollars and it was a great vale for my pocket, plus the great pic quality"
1,Not a real collection boxset.,"I like the movies and I want to add this trilogy to my DVD collection. However, this set is not a collection boxset that I am looking for. They are 3 separate spiderman movies in their own packages, and bundled together in a newly design cardboard box and called them ""Trilogy"".The worst is that they are the unsold inventory which they applied white stickers to cover the barcode in the back of each box. I felt cheated by Sony Pictures. They should have done a better job by creating a real boxset in a nice package with some additional materials.If you are looking for a nice collection boxset, please skip this set."
5,Spider-Man Trilogy,Received promptly - unfortunately I ordered the blu-ray and this is not what my son-in-law wanted. I trust the return will be equally easy.
5,I imagine it's good,"I bought this as a gift for a kid who's a Spider Man fan. He really enjoys it, but I'm not a super hero fan myself."
1,Perfect if I Lived In Europe,Received DVD's with no issue. The problem was that they were formatted for a region other than the United States. This is strange to be due to the fact that they were shipped from an American address to an American address. Amazon refunded my money with no issue.
2,Movies good but set is very cheap in quality,Felt like a cheap knockoff. Definitely works well for people that just want the movies but no money or effort was spent on the container.
4,Great trilogy,"Spiderman I, II, and III, were very entertaining and kept the grandkids entertained. The entire family enjoyed the films, popcorn and drinks."
5,Great buy!,This was exactly what I was looking for. I have the trilogy on Blu-Ray but my son is a huge spider-man fan and only has a dvd player in his room so as I gift I wanted to get this for him so he would be able to watch it whenever he wanted.
5,Wish I could get it locally,"The one supermarket chain in our area that carries Quaker Essentials Oat Bran cereal closed our local store. We can get it by driving around 60 miles round trip, but that is inconvenient and wasteful of gas.I could substitute another cereal for myself, but my peach-faced lovebird loves it, and so far will accept no substitute. She eats some, and dunks some in her water bowl, then piles it on a perch. The result is a ""cereal sculpture."" Why she does this, I don't know.I ordered it through an Amazon vendor and received excellent service, but I wish the shipping wasn't so darn expensive."
5,How a religion is Born!,"This was an excellent historical work on modern Pagan Witchcraft. It does tend to focus on Wicca, but it does also talk about Druids, and non-Gardnarian Traditions. If you know nothing about Wicca, I recomend you start with another book, or the very last chapter serves as an excelent summary of what Wiccans belive, and though it seams weird to suggest it, you might want to read the last chapter first. Although the author is a historian and not a Pagan or a Witch, he remains respectful in his historical endevor. This book is an excelent example of how a new religion is born, and perhapse the only such history of the birth of a new faith to exist!"
1,linear thinking loud equals authority,idotic to credit Robert Graves with inventing the Goddess. false authority. beware. sounds impressive but shoots self in foot repeatedly.
2,will it never end!?,"Small print, difficult to read. But wait - I might learn something here. So I use a magnifier and plug away. Nope - boring. There is absolutely no reason this research cannot be presented more simply. Well, maybe the author just wanted to impress other academics by being obscure. I hope he succeeded. But this isn't for ordinary people who want to understand the history and development of neo-paganism. There are lots of other, better written, more accessible, books out there that do a better job!"
5,Review of Triumph of the Moon,"I have not finished reading the book. I have, however, found it hard to put down. It was engaging, comprehensive and enjoyable to read. I heard this book recommended by sales people in my city Halifax.It is without a doubt informative and accurate in the history of Witchcraft. I know it was preferred over other books on the history of Witchcraft."
3,"Neither earth-shattering, nor an easy read.","When this book came in from the library, my first thought was, ""wow...finally...some serious scholarship on the subject."" And while this work is eminently cited in many books on its subject, it's neither an easy read nor particularly ground breaking in the arguments it makes and the history it provides.Now I should say I am no stranger to books published by academic presses, however, readability does matter to me and I just did not find it very accessible as a person overwhelmed in academic reading.In short, if someone was searching for a brief, realistic, and readable history of Wicca and Witchcraft, I would suggestBonewits's Essential Guide to Witchcraft and Wicca, which covers much of the same ground (history of witchcraft in ancient, pre-modern, and modern times and the development of Wicca) in much more readable but still serious tone and style."
4,"Excellent work, shame about the typeset.","This is a veyr detailed and informative history. However the paperback edition has miniscule print on low grade paper, so much so that it is hard to read for a long period of time. I would reccomend getting the hardback. The work itself is great and it's worth paying the extra to be able to read it without needing aspirin on standby."
3,Got iMovie?,"As a Mac user, I can just say that this cable is essential for anyone who wants to utilize the syncing features of iMovie with a Sony Handycam. The USB connector that came packed with my HC40 was completely useless when trying to connect to iMovie.This is essentially the reason I can't give it a higher rating than three stars. It was definitely frustrating to find that after investing in such a decent personal-use camera, that Sony expected me to buy still more of their stuff to make it even connect with my computer. If I had to purchase it at the ridiculous Sony retail price, ""frustrating"" would've been too mild a descriptor, but Amazon's discount helped soften the insult.Beyond that, I can't say a whole heckuva lot about it - it's a cable, after all. Ha!"
2,Annoyingly necessary profit generator for Sony,"Works as described. I am just so annoyed that Sony would lure me into buying their video camera for a competitive price without including this cable, making the overall cost of the camera no longer competitive. It's smart for Sony to conduct business this way, but only in order to earn profit in the short term. You can bet I won't be suckered in to buying any more Sony products in the future, now knowing that this is how they run their business."
3,Too bad Sony just wants more of your money,"This is just another way for Sony to make another $35 on the purchase of their Video Camera. Imagine my surprise finding out that I had to purchase a separate cable in order to create DVD's from my DV camera. As far as the cable itself goes, it is fine. But, it sure would give Sony more favorable talk on my part if they just included the cable when I buy the camera."
5,Worked just like it was supposed to,"This product worked exactly as it was supposed to. I had tried using the cable that came with the camera (USB cord) and found out exactly what many others had said on blogs.....IT DOESN'T WORK!!!Once I got this cable, it worked perfectly. I was able to easily download video from my camera to my computer. The only frustration I had was that I would rather have paid a little more for the camera and gotten this cable with it in the first place."
1,Cable not what it is sold as,Cable is sold as having the ability to transfer video from a camcorder to a PC.It doesn't do it. I spoke to the company and they told me that there is no cable that does that. I asked them why thet advertised this cable as being able to do it and he told me I should have known better. They then charged me 15% to take the cable back. You would be smart to shop elsewhere. They don't know what their products do and they charge you for their lack of knowledge.
2,Undecided - Be cautious,"It worked for about a month. Even when it did work it was a hit or miss thing. I had to fool with it for a while. Maybe it was because I bought the cheapest one available. Maybe it was a knock-off, who knows? I have yet to try it on another computer to rule out it not being the cord. Fair warning."
2,Upgrade computer,If you have a new computer or maybe newer that 2003 this cable will work if you are working with one older than that like me it doesn't work. So now I have this wonderful cable and waiting to get an upgraded computer to match.
1,"what a rip off, sony's using customers as cashcows, get the cable from apple instead for only $29!","I spent a couple hours, trying to get transfer DV from my camcorder to my mac powerbook. After hours and hours I had to realize that the USB cable delivered with the sony camcorder was absolutely worthless. If you don't own a sony VAIO (which in my opinion just a overdesigned peace of fancy 007 gear with an i.Link connection, which no other PC/MAC has)your getting frustrated pretty quick. I would have given the cable a 5 star rating, but the way I had to get the cable, by having to buy it seperately, is a big rip off. However I found the exact same cable in an apple store called ""Thin Fire Wire"". The exact same cable (1.8 Meter 4 to 6 pin to be exact) for only $29 and it works just fine. So check out an apple store near you and save some money.Shame on you Sony."
4,good dampener with good hitting sound,its a good dampener. I bought it for my head racket which is now 6yrs oldthe reason i bought it was because my racket was getting these little annoying noises when i serveso i tried it on and now the sounds are gone and its also very good for the price
4,"Different Colors than Shown, but works fine","The product photo shows one black and one red dampener, but TennisExpress shipped to me two white dampeners. I was actually hoping for the red and black ones, just to match my racquet, but I do know that is only cosmetic. The dampeners function just fine."
4,"good dampener, has never fallen out","Works as advertised; best shock absorber I've used. Silences the annoying 'poing' sound from the racquet, and has never fallen out, even on a direct mishit. Four stars because they are a little expensive for what you get."
5,"Awesome glasses, would buy again.","Very fast shipping and excellent transaction with Amazon. Couldn't be happier with these glasses, had them five years now and they are still wonderful."
1,Phantom Glasses - Beware!,"Ordered on September 24, 2005 -- delivery now estimated by Amazon ""sometime"" after December 24, 2005. Three months (or more) for delivery seems excessive. Amazon should be ashamed for treating customers this way."
1,Flatout is flat,"This game has some good qualities, but the pure racing person will have issues, as you gain $ for running into objects and cars, which blows. You are in a race and losing, so blast your car and everyone around you to get $$ for the next race. Realistic? Not. They don't even have a view from inside the car, it is a bumper view with no part of the car visible. The interface with arrow buttons is bad, and you can't even race online, just by LAN. In short, stick with Leadfoot or DTRSC and you will be at least $40 better off.jc"
5,A defining book.,"This book would be effective for grief therapy and for teaching about life cycles. It specifically answers the question: What is a lifetime?My daughter, age 4, had a lot of questions about death. She was most especially interested in finding out when her ""dying day"" would be. This book seemed to help her understand that everyone's lifetime is special to them. I wanted her to understand that because someone else died it doesn't mean her death is imminent. A common fear among the young.An exquisitely illustrated and plainly written book, it speaks clearly to the children about a complicated subject. I highly recommend it for all home and school libraries for ages three and up. It should be used as part of a comprehensive set of books on biological and familial concepts as it is not meant to answer all of a child's questions on life cycles, grief, death or dying."
3,"A ""matter-of-fact"" book about lifetimes and death.","This book is beautifully illustrated, and it explains the facts of life and death in a very direct and unsentimental way: all creatures have a lifetime, then they die. The book discusses the lifetimes of different living creatures, from insects who only live a few days, to large mammals who live many years. It describes people as living for ""sixty or seventy years, sometimes even more."" That is a little scary for a child whose grandparents are already way past those ages and still in great health. ""Lifetimes"" explains the concepts of lifespan and death, but does not offer comfort for those who fear death or are grieving. I recommend the book ""Gentle Willow"" for those who want a gentler, more comforting story, that is no less true to fact."
3,"Very gentle introduction, but awkward at times","I looked around for a book to help my wife and I discuss the concept of death with our 2 year old when his grandma passed away recently. Most of the books in the kid section were way too advanced. This is the only one I found that I was comfortable even trying to read to him. After a few reads he seemed to have a good understanding of the book.However the book could be improved in a couple of ways. First the cadence of the writing and starting a thought on one page and finishing it on the next can make it awkward to read, especially if you read slowly and talk about the illustrations. Secondly there is an injured butterfly shown early in the book who has died. But later on there is a healthy butterfly shown - this confuses my child as he thinks the butterfly got better. This undermines the message of the first butterfly, that sometimes things get so badly hurt that they cannot be repaired."
4,Great book,"This book helped my 5 year old a little. We need to read it a couple times. Thanks, it helped. He was concerned about dying."
3,Good book with a few problems,"This is a good book in many ways, but with a few issues that may prevent me from sharing it with my children.I like the straight-forward unsentimental approach to the topic. However at one point it states that people live for ""sixty or seventy years, sometimes even more."" As another reviewer noted, ""That is a little scary for a child whose grandparents are already way past those ages and still in great health."" It's also a bit off the mark, given that life expectancy in the US is close to 80, so 70 or 80 years might be more accurate...but I would have avoided putting a number on it myself.I also agree with other reviewers that the picture of the dead butterfly, followed by one of a live butterfly of the same species is confusing. And, finally, the splinter-removal picture is kind of scary and the child has a haunted look on his face.I recommend the book ""In a Nutshell,"" by Joseph Anthony."
3,I read this as a child...,"My Mother read this book to me as a child after my Father passed away when I was two years old. I have to say that the book was good at helping me understand death, but that the picture of the little boy with the splinter haunted me for years. I don't know what it was, but from that moment on, this book was known to me as ""The little boy book.""Just a warning for some parents that have children that may be fightened easily."
1,Break too easily,"My step-daughter got a set of glasses, and 3 family members cut themselves because they broke as they were washing them. I thought I'd replace her [poorly made] and dangerous ones with these, due to what I thought of as the quality name brand Anchor Hocking. She already got a different set of glasses, so I kept them for myself. One was broken in the box when I opened them up. I thought no big deal. I started using them, and within a month, of the 16 total, I am down to only one large one and four small ones. I also have 2 less butterfly stitches and 6 less bandaids in my cabinet. My daughter informed me that these were the EXACT glasses she experienced the same problems with. I am sorry to discover that Anchor Hocking is no longer going to be associated with quality, as it used to be in the past."
2,"Very ordinary performances, mediocre video quality","The musical performances here are quite dull. There is nothing wrong about them except that the musicians seem to be simply doing their job and nothing else. If I had paid good money for this concert in person, I would have been highly disappointed. The video quality is even worse. The DVD is cheap but not cheap enough to justify its purchase."
2,Difficult product,"I bought this DVD for the Mozart Symphony #35. However, it is very difficult to access the work. I finally figured out that the only way to do it is to fast forward through the final movement of the Lebrun Concerto. This problem was in evidence on several different DVD players one of which can track DVDs with any region code. There are some wonderful performances on this series. Too bad the engineering is so poor."
2,pitchshifter is not the same!,"When i first heard about deviant, i thought it would be something great (judging by previous records and the way Ps developed in their musical style). But after finally listening thru it i suddenly realised PS was trying to go mainstream. Their new CD is so much alike with Korn or limp bizkit music it was terryifing. I couldn't understand why Ps chose to opt out of the electronics towards more punk/rock style. In general this CD has some good tracks (2 to be exact), but it not deliver the goods like the previous CD's did. I AM SORELY DISSAPOINTED!"
2,What happened to Pitchshifter?,"The Pitchshifter sound that has been forged over their last 5 or so releases, culminating wonderfully with ""www.pitchshifter.com"" has here been stripped to a watered-down sound that could have come from any of 1,000 other bands who are wasting our time (and money) these days. The Pitchshifter formula of brutal guitars mixed with programed drums and other industrial and electronic affects was unlike anything else on the musical scene. That sound is completely gone on this CD--reducing their punishing onslaught to something that MTV would have little problem broadcasting. A very disappointing CD."
5,PSI stilll rocks,"I eagerly anticipated the release of this album, knowing whatever came out of it would be excellent. Musically, it was a dramatic change when compared to other albums such as pitchshifter.com, or infotainment? I like the somewhat mellow approach to many songs, but dont get discouraged, they still have the heavier stuff like ""keep it clean,"" ""dead battery,"" and ""wafer thin."" (my personal favorites) They just keep getting better and better after every release. people complain that they are going mainstream, they change for the times, and what not. At first they resembled one of my favorite bands, ministry, but look at them now, they have stepped away from that, and now have their own unique blend of techno, rock, industrial. they are on a plain all by themselves. lyrically and musically, they cannot be outdone by any rock, or industrial band out at the time. This album is their best to date. PSI ROCKS"
2,Bratz Helmet,"When I ordered this product, I didn't see a size chart and I was sent a size that is not suitable for the purpose intended."
4,Works well,"I just bought it a few days ago. Doesn't do miracles but the suction is great, works well on both carpet and hardwood floors, the noise level is reasonable. The only disadvantage is sort of cheap plastic construction but for the $89.99 I paid for it I can live with it :)"
5,Exceeded Expectaitions!,The CD was exactly what I was looking for. It arrived early. It was in pristine condition. I'm very thankful that I found this vendor as this was a very rare CD. I will use this vendor again.
4,Great follow up to From One.,"Ra is really underrated rock band. They have great melodies, good arganments, middle eastern vibe here and there, a singer who is really influenced by Sting and the Police. They even cover one of their songs. If you dig Breaking Benjamin or Alter Bridge, this band is for you. Every song is great, really no weak tracks. I highly recommend this cd."
3,Good but not great,"I agree with the other reviewers when they say From One is a better album. Don't get me wrong, this is a decent effort, but I feel like if you were to rate all these songs on a scale of 1-10, almost all these songs would be around a 7. ...Good, but not high enough to the point that the disc will still be getting regular play in your CD player 6 months to a year from now."
4,"Old, but new","I enjoyed this album. At first glance it appears that it is your standard post-1990's rock album. But after a good listen, you realize that they have succeeded in forging a rather good and unique album. It's well done and has a good shelf life due to its distinctive sound."
4,Good cd,"While ra's first cd is alot heavier, this one is more laid back. I like both heavy and lighter styles of music. I would have to say that this cd is better musically than the first one.visionclothingco.com"
4,Takes a few listens...,"Ra is a very interesting band to watch grow. Their first release (From One) was an excellent debut that showed off their potential. Its an album that can immediately be digested and have you loving them in no time. With ""Duality"" the band is still lyrically strong, if not stronger. However, instrumental-wise, the band has fallen into a very generic hole that they need to climb themselves out of. Not to say the instrumental on this album is awful, no, not by any means. It just doesn't stand out nearly as much as their debut album had. I've had this album since the first week it came out. There are a few tracks that you can immediately get into, mostly on the first half, but the rest will fall away from your first listen. Over time though you will grow to appreciate the rest of this album, I did at least.8/10"
5,Another RA Gem!,"For those of you that read my review for ""From One,"" pretty much what I said in that review is a repeat. This is an excellent CD, though toned down ""From One,"" it still rocks. You can't go wrong with ordering BOTH at the same time (that's what I did). BTW, I think RA does ""Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic"" BETTER than Police originally did it!!! ;^)"
3,Ra,"I loved the first cd, but this one is to regular or genric. There is absolutely nothing wrong with these songs... Each song is similar to the next one, the only time i got chills was when he sang...and in this cd all the does is sing uniquely for a second then back to chrous....*sigh* what happened? The songs in this newer album are okay, i liked the lyrics, its just missing that special something...oh well."
4,"More of the same, which is pretty good.","This album, of course, builds on the themes of the first one - Sahaj has a lot to say, and isn't done saying it - with plenty of the same texture and style that made the first album so listenable. Lyrically surprising, you may find yourself coming to an unexpected point when the song turns out to have something very different to say than first impressions indicated. Another reviewer had mentioned that they seem to be stuck with a single pattern of songwriting structure, and I can't disagree, but I'm willing to cut them some slack for a sophomore album. We'll see if they get a bit more adventurous for the third album."
2,"From Zero to Unfortunately, Duality","When I first heard Ra's ""From Zero"" I was in awe. A band that used cool effects, Egyptian scales, and was moderately heavy--the perfect mix for me. Then, Duality came out.Duality demonstrates a lack of creativity that was once there in Ra. I wouldn't say they evolved, I'd say they devoled. They still use effects, but rarely and they don't have as big of an impact. On top of that they hardly sound Egyption on the album. As for this album, Ra sounds more like other bands, but they are still distinct. I just wish they went in a different direction.I do want to say that their are some really awesome songs like Fallen Angels, Undertaken, and Taken. The other tracks are bad either, it's just that I expected a whole lot more."
4,"AWESOME, Not sure why 4 stars when I put 5","I found this Band while looking up information on Trixter and found PJ Farley in the band. Listened to RA on their website and bought this CD the same day. I have not found a band lately that took me away like RA.I have not heard the first album but it is next on my list, since I got Duality today and have not stopped listening to it!!!RA ROCKS!!!!"
3,"That'll do Ra, That'll do","Keeping in mind that Ra isn't too highly complex, I think it is safe to say that this was a pleasant surprise. Still even though I feel that they need to get the gears moving in order to escape the fate of all Nu-Metal bands. They are a very well balanced band that brings some good lyrics and musicianship and with the remake of ""Every Little Thing She Does is Magic"", I was pleased for the money spent."
2,17 years old and it shows,"Well, I might have agreed with the other reviewers if I hadn't ordered ""Strength Ball Training"" by Goldenberg and Twist at the same time. This book seems very amateurish by today's standards. It's a thin paperback with hand-drawn sketches. Maybe this was considered okay back in 1991, but this is 2008. SBT gives you all of the exercises in this book plus many more, updated with recent training science background, illustrated with photographs of actual people, plus a DVD with videos illustrating many of the exercises! And it's the same price! Come on, get into this century. Amateur productions like this one just don't cut it anymore."
4,good stuff,"great resource for anyone looking to add variety to medicine ball exercises, increase their overall explosiveness during intense physical activity."
3,rap stuff!!!,"this album is ok,but the beats are weak!the lyrics and rap mechanics are great---but the album lacks in too many areas!!only recommended for desperate hip hop listeners!"
1,Not a scholarly book,"The book was written by progressives as an attempt to rewrite history about the Christian heritage of the Americans who signed the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. This is not a scholarly work. It has no footnotes for reference. It was debunked by scholars the next year after it was written. It is an interesting reading to understand the effort that the authors and the people they represent would go to to advance their political agenda. It is a very unfactual book that distorts truth. With this understanding, people should read scholarly books to understand the Christian legacy of these people."
4,Required Reading for all Americans,"Let me be the first reviewer since 9/11 to weigh in on this valuable book. Every American reacted to the horrors of that day in their own personal way and many reflected on the secular foundations of our constitution but few people know the details of the struggle that went into the conception, the codification and the defense of our first amendment. The separation of church and state is the greatest source of our strength as a country; every American should know the struggle of Roger Williams, the history of the Southern Baptists, and the strong belief of our founding fathers in the freedom of choice regarding personal beliefs. All explained in this simple and scholarly book."
1,Brain washing,"I would like note that if you look at the footnotes for this book as to where they got there information, they do not have a shred of evidence to back them up. They simply state they they have forgone the traditional footnotes and that we should believe them just because they have a PHD. I know that if I were writing any type of paper for these gentlemen in college they would fail me if I didn't show where I got my information. Furthermore, There is a man in Texas who has the world's largest collection of artifacts from our founding fathers and he has loads of evidence which point to the extreme opposite. In fact he has a copy of bibles that were printed and distributed to every family in America through funding from Congress. I would encourage anyone who sees this to watch the documentary called ""MONUMENTAL"" by Kirk Cameron, exposes the truth about our constitution writers and points out the damage that books like these have caused to our society."
1,"Baseless, made up propaganda","This is a book that is used in colleges across America, but contains almost no primary source quotes, no footnotes, no endnotes, and thus no scholarly support for any of it's assertions. Did the author even bother to read the founders' letters, speeches, published works, etc? Probably not, bc actual quotes from those who founded this country would really get in the way of their made up speculation, hearsay, and biased opinions masquerading as historical fact. Pathetic."
1,the man from utah,"the movie was so blurry you could hardly see it,it wasnt verygood thank you carol meeks"
4,What happened to the Night World?,"I didn't like this book as much as the others. I still think it was good. But suddenly L. J. Smith sticks in a spirit from the in-between place. That has nothing to do with the Night World. It doesn't deal a lot with Gillian's witchcraft. In fact, she doesn't even know she's a witch until about the middle of the book. One thing I liked was Ash's cameo role as the knight in shining armor, coming to rescue the helpless human."
2,Definitely not her best.,"Okay, this was the first Night World book that I read, and it seemed pretty good. But compared to LJS's other books, this is pathetic. I don't know, most of her books are great, but really! Gillian is a weak character who is shallow enough to think that popularity is all that matters. David is boring and predictable, and I think Angel (or Gary) would have been much better for her. I wouldn't go for David because he acts all protective and stupid. Also, it makes the whole soulmate thing boring and not dangerous because the lost witch (Gillian) doesn't even know she is a witch at first. I think that LJS's other books are a lot better. ~Ondine"
4,Pretty Awesome!!,"This book, was in my opinion, pretty good. Not one of her best, but it was good. I really liked the story, and I really liked the characters. To me, the story had a different meaning, than most people had seen. If you read between the lines, you see that this is what a lot of people hope for. To be popular, to be perfect in every aspect, and to have power. I really liked this book, and reccomend it to anyone who likes Lisa Jane Smith, or anyone who likes books about ""Creatures Of The Night"" :)"
3,I thought it wasn't as good as the other Night World books,It wasn't as good as the other books in the series. I enjoyed Daughters of Darkness the most so far. I have bought every Night World novel that has been released and can't wait for new ones.
3,don't really know,This book is my least favorite of all tjhe N.W. books. It has almost nothing to do with the night world. Very disapointing. I think that David is really stupid and Gillian should be soulmates with Angel. Now that would've been cool.
2,Everlasting Love--what else?,"This book was not the best. It was boring and the characters were underdeveloped. I liked the idea that Gillian WASN'T gorgeous, rich, and plain perfect, but in a snap she became the typical LJ Smith character. I love the idea of soulmates and everything, but I think these kids find their soulmates too easily, and how come everyone in LJ Smith books have to be SO perfect? Maybe if they were not so gorgeous--really how many gorgeous people are there in the world who are ""perfect"" on top of that? If you want to read LJ Smith, read the trilogies or even the other Night World books because this book reads like LJ Smith was getting desperate for a ""new"" idea."
3,Not the best,"I was dissapointed with this book. It is my least favorite of the Night World books so far (I have read up to Black Dawn) I think L. J. Smith can write and has written much better books(ie: Daughters of Darkness, Secret Vampire, and The Chosen)"
1,I can't belive LJS wrote this,"I am a huge LJS fan, I have read almost all of her books well over 10 times except this one. It was so boring I really disliked to book. It didn't have anything to do with the NW until the book was almost done, and Gillian was so pathetic and whimpy. David.... I really didn't like his character at all."
5,I don't know what is everyone so disappointed about,"This was my first LJS book, recommended by a friend, who is a book critic. I was hooked on LJS books ever since. I have read every one of her books and have found them excellent."
2,This book wasn't near as good as the others,Gillian came off as a wimp. Angel was ok. They should have made Gillian seem more like a real girl and not someone from a soap opera.
3,It was good but what happened to the best?,"I love the series, I love the author, I love all her books, but what happened. It was a good book and worth reading but it needed more romance, more danger, more Night World,and definitely MORE SUSPENCE. I just bought the book to add to my selection but i think she should stick with what she does best....Night World not ghost stories."
2,This book is messed up,"In this book, not only is there no real ""love"" scenes, but to top it off, the girl's cousin tries to convince her that he is her soulmate. Granted, Angel is dead, but he's still related to her and definately should NOT be trying to catch his own cousin. Ewww. To top off the wrongness that is this book, there is barely any mention of vamps and stuff. Also, this is a 'coming of age' story about how being popluar isn't the most important. I love every other Night World book, but this is retarded."
3,Gillian and Angel---Dark Angel,"I just discovered the Dark World and I have to say that I love them, but Dark Angel was not my favorite, there was nothing to do with the Dark World at all until the very end and I just sat there and kept asking myself...""what does this have to do with the Dark World"" Love the rest of her books but this one was not the best."
3,Ths was not quite what I had expected.,This book had nothing to do with the Nigt World. I was disapointed that it didn't have anything about soalmates or any Night World related subjects. I do not know why Smith would actually put it in the series. This was the only book in the series that actually got boring. If you want cool excitement and romance read Black Dawn or Secreat Vampire!
1,I can't believe she wrote this!,"LJS's other books are great, but this one was so boring! There was absolutely nothing dangerous about Gillian and David being in love, and that's the whole point of this series! Also, it's kind of unlikely that someone could just cut her hair and wear makeup and then suddenly be popular. I didn't like Gillian at all. She's superficial, not to mention being Little Miss Weakling. David was an idiot because he fell for her as soon as he saw her with short hair and makeup. Let's get realistic! He cheated on the SATs and Gillian still wants to support him. Plus, he's BORING! LJS's other books are all 5 stars in my opinion, but I hated this one."
5,Underrated,This book is the ultimate revenge story. Sure Gillian is superficial but shes had a rough life and deserves to have her chance to shine in the spotlight. And all those readers who do not feel it fit in with the Night World must not have been very observant cuz her place in the Night World was hinted at quite a lot. And she does go to a witches store and she also trys to get in the black iris club once...besides it would be to formulaic if each book was wrapped tightly inside the Night World...each books show different levels of impact the Night World has...plus like all the nightworld books...this deals with a certain kinda topic...Secret Vampire was a girl who was dying and needed to be changed to live...soulmate covered reicarnation and this book delt with a near life experience. Its not the best of the series but its high up there on my list at least.
1,Left-Wing Propaganda,"This old chestnut of a book should be put out of its misery. It's written with style and a tone of authority, but careful reading shows that it is hopelessly slanted. On every significant point which involves historical uncertainty or controversy, the authors unquestioningly accept the left-wing/labor point of view and cynically disparage or totally ignore any other interpretation. This is Labor's ""untold"" story because no other reputable historians have ever had the nerve to write such an openly propagandistic book. Academic labor historians who think this book is so wonderful are merely showing their left-wing ideological colors. There are much better and more objective accounts out there."
5,Heavenly Music,This is by far the most beautiful CD I have ever listened to. I love it so much I have given it as a gift to family friends and they all love it as much as I do and it has quickly become everyone's favorite. It is truly music to adore and nourish your sprite and soul. Aeoliah is a genius - I give this music my highest recommendation.
4,Impressive,"One of the few CDs of Asatru music that I actually enjoy. I could quibble with some things in the lyrics which are not quite in line with the lore, but overall I find the music both pleasant and inspiring.This CD draws upon Scandinavian folk music for inspiration for its melodies. With the exception of one track, the lyrics are in English. The lead singer, Andrea Nebel Haugan, can actually sing! Professionally done and melodic.Many of my non-Heathen friends also enjoy listening to this CD."
4,The Haiku Year exemplifies integrating creativity,This small gem of a book can be appreciated not only from a modern poetic viewpoint but also from a philosophical standpoint as a comment on integrating pure creativity into our everyday motions. Read this book and be prepared to question your own thoughts. Perceptions might change after an afternoon with this book...
1,No stars but they all think they are and have stuff to say.,"You can be a rock star and not have a clue as to what haiku is. This book has been around. It has been the brunt of jokes in the haiku community. I can't say I know how to write a decent haiku but if you google, you WILL find some great haiku poets. PLEASE - if you don't have this book, keep it that way. It may have been a year but not a haiku one."
1,Definitely NOT haiku - poetry? Maybe...,"This is indeed a book of 3-line poems passing itself off as haiku. This is not harmful certainly UNLESS an unwary reader picks it up and assumes that it is, basing all future opinions of this delightful poetic form on The Haiku Year.""There are those who regard haiku as a kind of 'do your own thing' poem, and never consider its foundations. But the haiku, as soon as it goes beyond the beginner's efforts, becomes a matter incorporating traditions and established values, aesthetic and otherwise, and can not be written well outside them."" - Robert Spiess"
1,The only stars is the rocker,"You make it in rock and you think you can do it all. This book proves you can't. It is a truly poor excuse for a collection of haiku and it is particularly offensive because there are those who will buy it thinking it the real thing. Do yourself a favor and buy Higginson. You can look at this in a few minutes in the bookstore. It might be good for advanced classes in ""don't let this happen to you!"""
1,It's the end of haiku as we know it...,"This is what has become of haiku in English- and it is all bad. Haiku in America in general is vastly misunderstood and each of the verses in this volume show it. Some have three lines, some do not, some have kigo, some do not. By the looks of this, one can deduce that these ""poets"" gleamed their knowledge of haiku from Kerouac (another haiku fraud) rather than Basho. This is just an experiment really, conducted by a circle of friends who jotted down their thoughts and sent them to one another. Please, please avoid this title if you really care about or want to learn about haiku. Amazon should allow ""0"" stars when rating items such as this!"
1,poorly written nonsense,"The author apparently has some theory relating to unexplained phenomena, but you'll never figure out what it is from reading this book. He strings together repetitive descriptions of ""unexplained"" events, without coherent narrative or structure.The book is filled with ludicrous claims about what ""scientists know"" or ""studies have shown."" Of course there's no support for the claims.Don't waste your time on this book."
2,Boring,"Garbage. The author is no different from the other 50,000 lunatics running around the country chasing lights. The only difference is this guy wrote a book. Watch the X Files instead.."
3,just too all over the place,The movie condensed (and changed as movies often do) the book. The book is sort of about this and about all kinds of stuff. It just kept losing me.
1,"Dull, Disjointed","Two hundred pages into the book, and I'm still waiting for a cogent theme to emerge. Poorly written, poorly documented, and thin...in other words, perfect fodder for a commercial movie."
1,Bogus...bunk...B-A-loney,"I enjoy reading about ""unexplained phenomena"". I really do. I love ""real"" ghost stories and the like. However, I prefer an author to take a very scientific stance, exhausting all possibilities. Keel does not. He's a ""true believer"" and that's the problem.Somewhere in the book he supposes that this mysterious Mothman could have been a man on a hang-glider. ""Wow,"" I thought. ""That could almost be construed as logical."" However, he IMMEDIATELY debunks that theory with a statement to this affect: ""But hang-gliders were not very well known at that time.""*shaking my head*Whatever...the man needed to become familiar with Occam's Razor."
2,Disappointing,"The Mothman story is indeed a fascinating one. Unfortunately, the same adjective cannot be applied to ""The Mothman Prophecies."" John Keel's theories regarding the nature and origin of UFOs in general and Mothman in particular are more bizarre than the phenomena themselves. I was also put off by Mr. Keel's tedious obsession with men (in black) behaving badly.I've given this singularly overrated book two stars, rather than only one, because it does supply some (albeit nowhere near enough) information on the extraordinary occurrences of more than 30 years ago."
2,"repetitive, lackluster","I wanted to read this before seeing the film. Wow, what a bore. Keel's book reads like some scatter-shot diary with himself as the narrator. Maybe this stuff was revelatory back when it was originally published, but now with the X-Files cultural phenomena and all the other media about UFOs and the paranormal floating around, this seems pedestrian in comparison. The descriptions are always the same. Only the names change each chapter/sighting/contacting.Also, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK before seeing the movie. It will sap some of your enjoyment from Mark Pellington's excellent film (in fact, I was amazed at how well screenwriter Richard Hatem took this dross and put a narrative structure around it, but that's another review that belongs elsewhere....)"
3,Decent book,"While this book contained some interesting stories about ""aliens"" and abduction scenarios, it is also very disjointed and out of step. Keel bounces from one unrelated story to the next, and I can't for the life of me understand his ridiculous ""energy beings"" theory on UFO's; from what I could gather of his ideas, he makes people who think the dark side of the moon is inhabited by aliens seem almost mainstream. Despite my frustration with Mr. Keel's writing style and theories, I would still recommend this book to anyone interested in the paranormal."
2,mothman-putting the loose ends together?,"I found the movie leading in many directions....Why was John's wife appearing in Point Pleasent? Was this the mothman? Why did John appear for Gordon 3 nights at 2:30 a.m? These questions were never answered in the movie.... or did I miss something? The movie ran long for me, maybe because of the loose ends. I could be wrong, you decide. Go see the movie......"
2,Very Detailed and Never Ending,"I usually like the books better than the movie. It is an interesting book although it touches on everything and seems to repeat itself time after time. The movie focused more on the actual ""mothman"" and I felt the book just mentioned it among many other things. This book should have been named ""Mothman, Men In Black, UFOS, and the Kitchen Sink."" I was glad to be done with this book. Don't waste your money on this book, check it out from the library."
5,Outstanding UFO book,"Having read at least 50 books on UFOs and related phenomena, ""The Mothman Prophecies"" has become one of my favorites along with those of Jacques Vallee. This classic is a must read and reaches the unpopular but most likely true conclusion that UFOs aren't from outer space but are psychic in nature."
3,Fairly informative,"I found this book to be fairly interesting, but at times the reader becomes bogged-down in the history of these sightings..the book would have been better reading had it focused more on a personal level and investigated the more personal aspects of how these unique sightings changed people in that town. If you expect to find the movie within the book, FORGET it, it is NOT there. Overall, lukewarm reading."
2,Where's the beef or Mothman in this case?,"There is a lot about the 60s' that for obvious reasons, I have forgotten but I do remember that there were a lot of Instamatic cameras and 8 mm movie cameras around so I guess my question is: Why are there no pictures of this thing? I believe the good people of Point Pleasant saw something as there were at least 100 reported sightings of ""Mothman"" and I simply cannot accept the author's statement that all those camera's that the newspeople took along failed to work for one reason or the other.The movie was excellent but then it was not based entirely on this wacky book which is written in kind of a random fashion and is not all that good in the first place. ""Show me the pictures."""
2,Not What I'd Hoped For,"I had expected, or at least hoped for, a more or less straightforward account of the Mothman phenomenon of some 30 years ago. Instead, this meandering book comprises ""hick"" UFO sightings that are only infrequently connected with Mothman, and Keel's trust-me-I- know-what-I'm-talking-about theories and explanations. I was particularly dismayed by seemingly endless accounts of men (in black) behaving badly. With little to recommend it (and aside from providing some details on the Mothman sightings, there's no other recommendation), ""The Mothman Prophecies"" is a considerable disappointment."
4,"Interesting, but requires extra work on the part of the reader.","As many of the other reviewers have said, this book isn't in chronological order nor does it put forth any kind of explanation for the mysterious events it describes - which I myself was rather disappointed by. You can catch glimpses of what Keel might be thinking from his comments throughout - enough to know, for example, that he doesn't buy the extraterrestrial invasion theory and that he thinks that the things people see are naturally occurring phenomena that most people just aren't aware of - but he never really sits down and explains it at length, despite the wealth of information he's gathered and thought about.However, the anecdotes and experiences presented were interesting - and by the sheer wealth and similarity of them, compelling. The nonlinear format might have helped to make it interesting in some ways, even if it distracted in others."
1,SHAME ON YOU MR. KEEL !!!,"Let me just start by saying that the "" MOTHMAN PROPHECIES"" is not a novel, nor is it a coherent story. It starts strong, just enough to draw you in, then it goes down the spectral energy crap hole. Were led to believe that Mr. Keel is a sensiable, unbiased investigator, when really he's a parinoid delusional whack. I'm only 15, and I don't buy a word of it!!! see the movie instead."
2,Reads Like Keel's dropped his notes and never rearranged them,"Excellent and suspenseful information. All over the place as far as the material. We travel back and forth from West Virgina to London to Ohio... and back again. Would have enjoyed it if the first part of the book was supporting information as to the phenomena itself and how it has indeed appeared elsewhere in history, how the phenomena ties to UFO sightings etc. but Keel's hypothesis that all paranormal activity comes from a parallel universe it difficult to believe, even for paranormal studies. I'm sure that is a first.Although the book was suspenseful and written well, it was just organized poorly. Revise, John. You can do it."
3,"Thought provoking, but....","Overall this was an entertaining and thought provoking book. Very little is mentioned about the mothman compared to UFOs, MIB, stange lights and cattle mutations. I did find Keels thoughts on vampires, angels and UFOs being all from the same entity very interesting. I kept finding myself wondering if Keel was overly paranoid, however this may well be the point. Are all people who encounter UFO's paranoid or are there powers at work that make them and us think they are paranoid? Now, I'm sounding paranoid! Because of this book, I will continue to read on UFO's , and for that reason I liked the book."
1,Mothman proficies ?,"257 pages covering Men in Black, lights in the sky, and phone troubles. 10 pages about the Mothman. If you want to read the same old 70's UFO stories, this is your book. If you want to read about the Mothman, buy something else."
1,Boring & Unbelievable Story,"Normally, I prefer books to movies, but Mothman Prophecies was not only boring, but unbelievable. Non-fiction! The story was a product of the author's imagination. Perhaps in 1975, when the novel was first copywritten, it was spectacular. To those who are thinking of purchasing this book, (especially after viewing the movie) I'd say pass it up, and purchase the VHS or DVD."
3,"Slow start, but great ending sci-fi read","This book, to me, starts out a little slow, in that the author focuses solely on THE mothman and peoples' accounts with him (what he looked like, did, etc.). For about the first 100 pages the author pretty much lists interviews and 1st hand accounts with contactees and their experiences. Though, after the 100th page or so (I don't know what it is about the 100th page for me), the book gets really interesting. Things start happening personally to John Keel himself. It seems as though, the more he begins to find out, and the deeper he goes into things, the more things begin to get in his way and stop him. It becomes apparent that someone or something doesn't want him to know what he knows.. Yet he persists. A very good book which lives up to its name."
1,Never Before.......,"Have I quit reading a book.I made it to page 123 before I had to stop. I've waited years to read this, oh man was I disappointed.I thought it would be an intelligent well written peice on the mothman mystery. I don't know what this was. Holy mackeral. i've never seen such bad writing. Someone else mentioned incoherent, tell me about it! This was all over the place. I had absolutely no clue was was going on in this book. Just crazy!Just a few of my favourites:"" so horrified she dropped the small baby in her arms. The child began to cry, more insulted than hurt."" what!? I'm thinking the kids was more hurt than insulted. This Keel dude is too much....Talking about this ""mysterious"" guy Tiny who a witness said saw a wire running up his pant leg. and i quote"" was tiny wearing electric socks? or was he a wired android operated by remote control.""what???! pretty much where I stopped before my mind turned to mush"
1,huh?,I just don't get it? I thought this book was a story about the paranormal and all the town needed to do was buy some Raid.Also anybody can tell you moths just son't grow that big... now June Bugs well now that's a story.
2,BORING!,"The subject matter is fascinating and has the potential to make an exciting, fast moving read. Unfortunately the presentation is disorganized, repetetive and BORING. I had to force myself to finish the thing and ended up wondering what the heck the point was meant to be. I certainly didn't feel that I had acquired any clear understanding of what happened in Point Pleasant; I didn't even get enough out of it to decide whether I believe any of the stories or not. If you want the book, borrow it from someone and save your money."
2,A Let-Down...,"John Keel's ""Mothman Prophecies"" could be a great book if it actually concentrated on the ""Mothman"" sightings in and around Point Pleasant, West Virginia in the mid-to-late 1960's. Unfortunately, this book isn't really about the Mothman, but it should instead be entitled ""John Keel explains how the universe really works"". For every ""Mothman"" story that Keel relates in this book, he offers at least three other stories of his personal life, his adventures in researching the paranormal, and his decidedly offbeat theories about paranormal events and what causes them. This book isn't really about the ""Mothman"" sightings in West Virginia as much as it is a goofy memoir of John Keel's ""research"" into the world of UFOs, demons, ghosts, and other bizarre events. As someone who bought this book to read about the ""Mothman"" and not about Keel's disjointed ramblings and ravings, I was sorely disappointed. Not recommended."
1,The Mothman in Bits and Pieces,"This book is NOT like the movie. In fact, I prefer the movie. The book is composed of bits and pieces of John Keel's and others' phenomenal experiences. It is difficult to read, not only because of the bad press printing, but also because it is very clipped and disjointed. I bought this book to delve further after seeing the movie, and ended up more confused. Go to the movie--forget the book!"
3,the mothman prophecies,"I thought this book was very informative to the reader. It's the first book that I have read about 'mothman' or ufos and now I am more interested in the phenomena. The content of this book is good, but I think that it could have been organized a little better. It would have helped if the author told the story in chronological order. There is not much dialog, but if you enjoy reading a book filled with desccription, then this book would probably appeal to you. Do not expect the book to be just like the movie because it's not, it goes more into detail. The book was very interesting and gave John Keel's opinion about what happened in Point Pleasant."
4,"""It was a dark and stormy night""","John Keel's ""The Mothman Prophecies"" follows a usual form for ufology books: He presents a large collection of anecdotes, personal observations and experiences, mixes it with some debunking to woo the scientific mind, and throws in some ancient gods and goddesses, references to fairies, and a variety of religious ""sightings"". This is par for the course in this genre, and puts this reviewer in mind of Charlie Brown's standard beginning for tales, ""It was a dark and stormy night.""Despite its rather disorganized and somewhat repetitive presentation (again, fairly standard for this genre), Keel relates his narrative earnestly, and he will engage your interest. Men in Black? Saucer shaped vehicles with diamond-shaped windows? ""Thyroid-like eyes""? If this gets your attention, you'll enjoy ""The Mothman Prophecies.""The recent movie is based only loosely on Keel's research, by the way, and will fail to satisfy informed ufology readers."
2,"Interesting, but read the fine print....","Ok, we have seen the movie, some of us have read Keel's book (this being a reprint). What no one seems to mention is the fine print located on the copyright page, which reads: ""This is a work of fiction. All the characters and events portrayed in this book are either products of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously."" If you don't believe me, glance at the copyright page. Obviously, this paperback edition was prepared as a movie tie-in. Touted as a ""true event"" the publisher then informs us it is all a work of the ""author's imagination."" And therein must lie a lot of truth. Yes, the book is mildly entertaining, if a bit choppy in parts. My advice is, read THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES with a large dose of salt (and the movie is much better)."
4,SURREAL AND THOUGHT-PROVOKING,"I have never been interested in UFO literature, but decided to give this book a try. The early portions of the book are rather dry documentations of UFO sightings and other paranormal incidents. Towards the end of the book however, things pick up considerably. The author's description of events is credible and eerie. He concludes that so-called 'extraterrestrial' beings are really with us here on Earth but only perceived by those with perceptual abilities that most of us do not have. He also concludes that such beings are capable of influencing and interfering with humans. For books outside of the UFO literature that corroborate Mr. Keel's conclusions I recommend 1) The Active Side of Infinity (Carlos Castaneda), 2) Far Journeys (Robert Monroe), 3)The Path (Esmeralda Arana)."
5,This book is a classic!,"I read it first in the 60's and have never forgotten it. I was pleased when it was reprinted as I had wanted to read it again. It holds up surprisingly well. Keel had realized things about the 'UFO phenomena' then that most other researchers are only now beginning to understand. If you have a sense of wonder, get it. If you are a researcher, get it. If you are an open minded skeptic, this will give you a better perspective. If you're just looking for entertainment, it's a lot of fun."
5,Very comfortable,"Beautifully made and perfect for restorative yoga. I couldn't be happier. I own several other products from Hugger Mugger and always choose their product when available for bolsters, meditation cushions, etc."
1,POOR QUALITY INCORRECT,"the item that is stated does not look like the stock graphics , the picture that is show is not what the item looks like . dont count on a good quality product"
4,"Great album, but one thing...","I first heard M.I.A. in a recreation hall on my University's campus on a mixer with a great sound system (filled the entire downstairs and upstairs with sweet vibes). I agree with most of the points on other positive reviews: this has great beats, lyrics, vocals, and the likes.There is one thing you should keep in mind before buying or judging this album: it almost REQUIRES a good sound system because the music feeds off the bass. Like many ""dance"" genres, bass is a heavy component in making the tracks work, and this is no exception. The vocal are great, but have difficulty standing alone without heavy bass. Thus, if you're like me with two simple speakers and a default sound card, you might want to reconsider buying the album or risk slight disappointment.For me, it was a very upsetting difference, because I know what the songs COULD be. I would recommend high quality speakers/sound card and a woofer, or else you're missing out--big time."
5,Buy it.,"She is a genius, has a lot to say, it's worth hearing, and this hard-to-categorize music absolutely grows on you and becomes your favorite album for weeks once it sinks in. Sound is fun, too, considering lots of toy instruments are used here, and there are a number of producers.M.I.A. is relevant, interesting and makes you pay attention.Buy this album."
4,excellent,"For me this is a little tricky. I know next to nothing about this type of dance music, so I really have no criteria to judge MIA.But I do like the low frequencies, quite a shock for a rock and jazz guy. I also like the singer's voice: she can sing at quite a speed, but through her Shi Lankin accent, the emphasis is placed in the most interesting places. All the little moans and in between music noices remind me of jazz. I also like the little eletronic ambers that burn through the tracks.As sound, this is quite a treat."
5,Worth the Buy,You can't help but respect the creativity poring out of this album. This was M.I.A.'s debut & the reason why so many love her. I love this album & it hasn't left the car in weeks.
1,Why Can't I Rate at Zero Stars ?,"Come On, People !!!! I checked this out because Amazon emailed me saying it was top rated.... ??? Could it be because one of the ""songs"" is entitled ""Amazon"" ? Sex appeal !? Not !!!! - unless you want to have sex with a monkey.... And for those who think this is the best album they've heard in a long time - my condolences ! Seriously, this recording is nothing more than a possibly somewhat cute girl chanting gibberish over some low-fi computer generated noise loops. True artists should be outraged, and they would if they could stop laughing. I recommend steering way way clear of this sorry excuse for music. Please, people - don't let big music money tell you what is good - we all suffer for it in the end."
2,Sound Catchy but mix with Terrorists,I have to agree some songs sound very catchy.But isn't she singing about some Terrorist Group in some Asian Island? I heard even MTV ban some of her songs because of that.
2,surprised,she's sri lankan but it's like she's trying to be west indian or something. Ok it kind of works and she's really pretty but I think she would become even bigger if she marketed herself to bollywood and gave the music the dancehall sound. It would give her some nice exposure.
2,OK,"You can tell the difference between this and the next. A couple of good songs, nothing spectacular. One song on this CD appears on the movie ""War"" with Jet-Li. Although I rate this with an OK, Im very tough. There's no sappy love ballads, no whiney boy songs. It's in your face, and strong."
3,huh?,"yeah, gotta concur with the rest of the folks reviewing this album here, what the hell was all that hype for? any one of my faded friends with fruity loops or even reason could have made these beats, first off. secondly, does this chick's vocal style make anyone but me think of the spice girls? if you're looking for something new, genre-bending, and actually interesting beyond any dancehall vibe it might instill, check out the new prefuse 73 album. i'm just glad i downloaded arular instead of buying it. suckers."
1,A Question,"Can someone please tell me how she managed to be signed by A!!!!record label, let alone one capable of putting her music (if that's what you call it) into the airwaves as much as it is."
1,fine if you support terrorism,"I find the terrorist links in her songs offensive.Taken from Fire Fire-""Growin up, Brewin UpGuerilla gettin trained uplook out look outFrom over the Rooftop"" [reffering to LTTE snipers]""Competition coming up nowLoad up,Aim,Fire Fire,Pop""She has a lot of LTTE propaganda in her music website, and even promotes this terrorist organisation in her music. She needs to get a grip, and the people buying her music need to get a grip and actually look at what they're buying here."
4,At least she's hotter than hell ;),"Galang is the strongest track here and I'd agree with many that it is no musical revolution. I enjoy it due to the fact it's a WORLD disc and I like World music alot. It's definitely different and I had seen the video for GALANG on the IMF Satellite channel. She's hotter than hell in my opinion so I'll give her a break. ;)And with those criticizing Revolution, America was created on a violent Revolution so I have no idea what they're talking about. When you live under brutal oppression you revolt which none of us in America understand anymore. Thank God we don't have to revolt here like others but people need to study what goes on in certain areas of the globe.Sometimes simple beats are good and this is better than alot of the major Rap trash here without any meaning at all."
4,She's A Paradigm in the Making.,"If you don't believe in her politics, listen to the music - we can't all be John Lennon. But we could aspire to be Public Enemy - different genre, same ethos. With her minimalist approach, she jettisons a rapid-fire selection of rage, humour, politics [sometimes muddled and confusing], sex...but always arresting and thought provoking. Online pugilists argue the terrorist/Tamil revolutionary ties via her father, and while it's an important salient subject to spelunk, weaving the politico with the dance floor is an exhilarating art I can't overlook based on that writ - Madonna could learn a thing or two about juxtaposing them creatively [see American Life]. My grade: A"
2,Gets old fast,"The first time through I really enjoyed the quick quirky beats, and the skits were sorta interesting as well. The novelty wore off after the first play through and it soon went from quick, quirky, and interesting to obnoxious, and boring. Perhaps this just isn't my style of music but I heard a lot of good things about this album and figured I'd give it a try. I found myself enjoying her biography a lot more than her album."
3,Aquired taste,"I didn't like this album that much at first, but it grew on me. I got this CD as a gift, listened to it once and threw it a side. I decided to give it a second chance and it really grew on me as I listened to it more and more. The singing at times gets on my nerves, but I like a lot of the songs. The lyrics are the best part of this album. ""Fire Fire"" and ""Amazon"" are my to favorite songs. Some of the electronica is interesting, and she does not sound like anyone."
5,Awesomely Different,"This is something my ears crave; uniqueness. This album has what you need to get loose. With it's wild beats and crazy lyrics, it'll keep you dancing (and in my case, running as well. Good workout music). M.I.A.'s music is not conventional. My guess is, most people either love it or hate it. Enjoy, it's a treat!1. Banana Skit2. Pull Up The People 8/103. Bucky Done Gun 10/10 (My fav. A true dance track. On point)4. Fire Fire 9/105. Freedom Skit6. Amazon 10/107. Bingo 6.5/108. Hombre 7.5/109. One For The Head Skit10. 10 $ 9/10 (The beat is sick! Robotic, lol)11. Sunshowers 10/10 (My 2nd fav. Gives me a real island vibe)12. Galang 9/10"
3,A mixed bag.......,"well... i bought this cd, soley for the reason that i loved the song 'Galang'. After listening to it through a couple times- i started to notice some lyrics that had a somewhat disturbing ouvre. This is evident in 'Fire Fire', and ""Sunshowers""...Other than that...this album doesnt live up to what i thought it would... some good beats, though."
3,M.I.A. - 'Arular' (Beggar's Banquet),"Not all that familiar with this artist.Seems like decent dance,house,club...whatever some call this genre these days.The remix of ""Amazon"",""Fire Fire"" and the seven-minute ""Galang"",I thought was good.No,this isn't even close to my favorite sort of music,but I thought I'd give it a listen.If you're the type of person that hangs out in dance clubs until 2am,you should dig 'Arular'.Might appeal to fans of Beyonce,Ciara and Missy Elliott."
2,What's the big deal?,"The only thing interesting about this album is mia's accent. Seriously, the beats her singing is layered over are tired and clichéd. If the vocals on this album were by anyone else it would not be in the top 500. Final Verdict: Bad music."
1,#2 overall on editor's top 100 albums???,"Wow, what kind of credentials do you need to be a amazon critic or editor? Certainly not good taste in music! The selection of this album at #2 on the editor's picks of the top 100 of 2005 leaves me grasping for reality and laughing til I can't breathe. You've got to be musically challenged, deaf, and under 12 to like one track on this album. The 5 star ratings?a sure sign the apocalypse is upon us."
5,Take this simple test,"If you can listen to this album - any track on this album - for more than 4 or at most 5 seconds and (1) stay still (2) keep it clean and PG13, my condolences to your family, alas, you are dead. You can expect to be receiving the memo shortly."
5,Love It!,"Who is M.I.A. and what has she done to the art of music?! The London-raised Sri Lankan MC has mixed up all possible forms of music to give us something that we can't define. You can't put a label on her sound; you can only identify her inspiration. With a combination of Jamaican dance hall, hip-hop, electronica, Brazilian funk, and Asian bhangra, her style is different from anything we're used to; it's addictive and fun. Her lyrics are filled with passion about life and society. She gets political and sexual all in the same song! Who does that? Maya Arulpragasam does... just listen to Bucky Done Gun off her debut album Arular to get a feel of her artistic flair."
5,Wha can I get for ten dollah? Anyting you want!,"Definitely spend a couple of bucks more & get this. Maya Arular is one of the few hip-hop sensations who deserves all the hype. Phrases like ""raw talent"" are often used, but what also impress are the musical sophistication and biting wit. This is a hugely appealing sex-war-and-lollipops album, and fears that non-British audiences ""won't get it"" seem to have been unfounded judging by the sales. Exuberant and bursting with energy."
4,Can't get enough!,"Gosh where to begin. First off, thank the powers that be for artists like M.I.A.!Sitars, bongo drums, thumping basslines, blips and beats, there is everything but the kitchen sink in Arular. M.I.A.'s music is in a genre all of its own. More a fusion of hip-hop and electronica with a healthy dose of South Asian flavoring. I can't even begin to tell you how welcome and refreshing her sound is in this era of cardboard, cookie cutter music.Stand out tracks include Galang, Hombre, Pull Up The People and Sunshowers. While M.I.A. brings together a wild range of sounds and beats, it's fairly accessible and this is music you will want to dance to. Highly recommended."
4,"rhythmic, textured, danceable electronic music","i love this music, but i can see how some people wouldn't. i guess reading through the reviews here says the same thing: this doesn't try to be the kind of music my mother would like (or some of my coworkers). but that must be obvious if you listen to the samples amazon provide.but otherwise, this is pretty sweet - it strikes a nice balance between playing with new ideas/sounds on the one hand and keeping a steady groove on the other. ""commerical experimental"" in a good way - and i think that's a very challenging target.as for the politics and trying to second guess whether this woman is ""for real"" - it doesn't matter unless you don't like the music. good music doesn't need to (and usually doesn't) match my politics. why on earth should it? if you don't like the music, fair enough. but to argue that you don't like music because of the attitude or the politics - what's with that? you're confusing music with something else, i think."
5,this girl can spit!,"i first heard the track bingo on the radio not long ago, and that has now opened a whole can of worms for me. how can one album be so catchy, raw, fun,fresh ,chunky and funky. while so many rappers drawl on about tired blah blah, MIA just mixes the singing and ragga-ish vocals straight into the most modern type of no-category music with little effort. the style? its kind of UK grime meets hip-hop meets calypso or something. definately a british vibe here, but this is still unique. the beats and sound effects are very well implemented into the chatting. cant stop listening to this. wicked stuff"
2,M.I.A.,"This sounds like karaoke. I wish it didn't - but it does. I'm a white man married to an Indian girl - I love Indian music, Chutney is cool, reggae, etc. - and the lead singer is attractive - but it really, really sounds like karaoke....I can't escape that fact. And...yes....it is very repetitive, mundane, same sounding music throughout the whole CD. But, it doesn't matter because todays ear for music is pretty much on the deaf side. Simple and repetitive is the cornerstone of todays musical taste. Oh well - I'll watch the video though - she's cute. But, it is still a talentless serving up of supposed 'world music'. What a bunch of crap that is! Listen to 'The Mysterious Voices of Bulgaria' or 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' if you want REAL world music. What? It's boring? Then you don't really like 'World Music' - lol."
1,Anyone notice terrorist references?,"This is good music, but I really have a problem with some of the lyrics.For instance, Sunshowers:""You wanna win a war? Like PLO I don't surrender""""It's a bomb yo, so run yo, put away your stupid gun yo... that's why we blow it up before we go""""they showed him a picture then, ain't that you with the muslims?""Now I'm not one for censorship, but I can't back someone glorifying PLO and terrorism in dance music. That's just ridiculous. I know reggae has roots of being somewhat violent and rebellious back at its early roots, but I absolutely can't sponsor these messages. It's just wrong."
3,Clear your head before committing to this!,"In this critical examination of the ""art of the novel"", Kundera meditates upon the existence or non-existence of ""art"" in novel-writing. It is a combination of narrative and philosophical ponderings highlighted by Kundera's famed lyricism. However, therein lies the the book's weakness. The dense language could lose your ""average"" reader and some issues, such as the meaning of art, begin to lean far more towards the philosophical rather than in analytical technique. Kundera tends to wander off on tangents."
5,His Best?,"Well it so hard to pick a favorite Kundrea book because they are all so Brilliant, but I might pick this one."
5,The Three Ds,"I've read the poems within, and the depth of feeling within them is impressive. What's more, the honesty in the poems is a breath of fresh air that has brought a new perspective to a lot of the ways I see things, partcularly loss and betrayal, as well as hope. Reading this book, I feel as if I truly know the poet behind the words."
3,mixed reviews,I have had a set of 8 blue colorwave for at least three years now. I love the square salad plates and the bowls have held up great. The plates seem to be the problem. Some of the plates are not molded the same and will not stack nicely. Utensil scratches are the biggest problem. Originally one or two plates were very bad that we only used them when we had to. Now they are all developing scratches. I will be looking for a new set of dishes soon. Maybe I should avoid stonewear.
4,How to beat the gray marks,"I like the simple design of Noritake Colorwave dishes, but was unhappy with gray marks from metal tableware. I have discovered that the right dishwasher detergent takes care of this. I was using a phosphate-free powder, for ecological reasons, but it was not getting my dishes clean. Researching this, I learned that in the last year, phosphate-free dishwasher detergents have improved a lot, so this problem may go away by itself. Otherwise, try a different phosphate-free detergent; the tablets seem to work best."
2,Noritake Colorwave 16 piece place setting,"I ordered a 16 piece place setting , service for 4 but only recieved a 4 piece place setting, service for 1. I contacted Amazon and they arranged to have the order corrected and arrange for return for the incorrect order. Once to corrected shipment arrived again it was a service for only 1. I was charged for a service for 4. This was eventually credited back to me however since I only had 2 place settings, I purchased 2 others locally at Younker's department store. The dishes that came with from Amazon are different than the ones from Younker's. It is like the molds were different or something...the plates are deeper from Amazon and as a result the set does not stack properly. I am not certain if this inventory issue has been resolved with Amazon so buyer beware."
4,After ten years . . .,"For our wedding registry, we chose this Colorwave set. That was more than ten years ago. I liked it because the color (we have green) was attractive, and it wasn't too fancy for everyday use. The set has held up fine, with the exception that two out of twelve bowls have nicked. The bowls nick more easily than the plates and coffee mugs, which haven't nicked at all. Considering it's been ten years, I don't think the nicking problem is all that bad. I just have to be extra careful with the bowls. They tend to nick when I'm washing the dishes and accidentally bang them against one another."
4,Very good product.,"Noritake product are really durable and I was worried since the first set was purchase in 2005, what will be the color if I get some more plates in 2011? There is in fact a little color change but nothing disturbing. Probably due to the use of a dishwasher for many years! The new plates are a bit more brilliant and a little touch darker...Really happy about this purchase..."
4,Timeless classic.,"I just finished Gods Of Mars and am ready for chapter 3. I feel truly fortunate to have ""discovered"" burroughs at 43. The rush of action, the clash of steel and its all mine for the taking. I have been forewarned that perhaps after the first three books it becomes hit and miss but I shall discover that for myself. Do yourself a favor and pick up A Princess Of Mars - book 1 - if you haven't already."
1,Great story sorriest printing and binding Ive ever witnessed,"The story , of course , is fabulous but this is the worst binding I have ever seen in 30+ years of reading paperbacks. I can't believe this isnt a joke. Hopefully I can get a refund and order the book from a reputable publisher later. If you buy a paperback from anyone make dang sure it isnt an ""Instabook"""
4,Album worth a Review,"Lets get to the point. If I were to listen the album, without any knowledge of Derrick Plourde, or the lyrical content I would of seriously overlooked the album. The music (compared to older) is so bland. The riffs are weak, the guitar work is recycled, the drums are painfully dull. The music really has no edge.But throw in the sensative underlying message in the equation(suicide), and it truly livens up the record. TRULY. The album is 3rd right after DUH and TRASHED.NOTE: Drumming did go out the window after Plourde left! The man was sick. Bad astro showed none of his talent.Pick this record up."
3,CONSISTANTLY GREAT!!,"Lagwagon always delivers. Their records are always full of great riffs, hooks, melodies. This one is no different. It will take me a few days to digest these 12 songs, but it's very good (as ususal). Lots of references to former drummer Derrick Plourde who commited suicide earlier this year. Has the same style, fast, upbeat, some metal-like solos....Great stuff, buy it."
5,A wish to time travel to 1880's Rockaway.,"Old Rockaway, New York in Early Photographs, exceeded my expectations! I thought it would provide a photographic history of perhaps the 1930's and 1940's. I was pleasantly surprised to find nineteenth century photographs of the peninsula in its true heyday. Having lived in Arverne during the 1960's and 70's, I was amazed to see that the rich and famous visited this area very similar to the way the rich and famous today visit the Hamptons on the east end of Long Island. As you view the postcards from this early era, you can actually see the unspoiled landscape of sand dunes and bay marshes that no longer exist. And the magnificent hotels and homes that graced this once popular resort prove to me that the City of New York truly mis-managed the development since the 1930's."
4,Great to see the old neighborhood!,"I would probably have given this book 5 stars if the Belle Harbor section (where I grew up in the 60's and 70's) had been better represented, but still, it was great to see the neighborhood I left as a teenager in 1976!For those that live --or lived-- there, especially if you spent any amount of time in Far Rock, you must get this book.To the authors: issue a revised edition with a more emphasis on everything West of Beach 116th Street... and I'll go 5 and a half stars in my next review!"
4,"Old Rockaway, New York, in Early Photographs.","Simply the only printed information available about the Rockaways of yesterday. It seems that everyone has roots in this once grand seaside community and this book gives you hundred of old postcard views of the towns along the beach. There's not much left there from the old days and even fewer people left in the NYC slum who know how to read or right. So we'll bet that most of the sales of this book will be outside of Rockaway. But if you're heart's at the seashore, then Vincent and William's book should be in your library...EKG, (escaped to Long Beach, NY)"
5,"Lyricist, singer, and more!!!!!!!","Bernie is one of the best lyricists out there!!! His vocal performance on this cd and ""Tribe"" show that he is not just a lyric writer, but also someone who loves music. His passion for music has continued on to the formation of the band ""Farmdogs"".I have a question, however. The previous reviews state that this is either Bernie's second or third solo album. What were his first attempts?Please let me know at: Robin@moonsitter.comThank you!!!!"
2,2/5,This album is 2 stars because some of the songs are listenable. I hardly enjoy listening to this album.I hardly recommend this album. Addy.
2,FORMULATIC AND HEARTLESS,"THis band from Scandinavia reminds me of Stratovarius. They sound so clean, so perfect, that you almost forget they are playing rock. It's boring and flat sound, and the female singer is annoying with his boring voice. It's a totally forgetable experience."
5,One great album!,"I bought this album because I got into bands like Theatre of Tragedy, Tristania, and The Gathering. Like someone else said, however, Nightwish is not doom/goth metal. Was I dissapointed?...no! This album is a masterpiece, pure metal all the way. Power metal with a female opera singer? I can't think of two things which go together any better. It is a wonder that it hasn't been done before. The songwriting is very good, and definitely laden with fantasy. The production is excellent as well. Then there is the amazing singer. I was captivated after hearing her for a mere ten seconds. Nightwish is one band that SHOULD NOT be overlooked!"
3,"Great music, horrible mastering","Wishmaster is one of my favorite Nightwish albums. However, I was always disappointed with the insanely high dynamic range compression and distortion on the CDs. So I thought why not try the LP instead - with any luck it'll have a completely different master. Unfortunately, it seems like all they did was apply the RIAA curve to the CD and cut it into vinyl.If you're buying this for the collector's value then great, but if you actually want to listen to it don't bother and just stick with the CD instead."
5,The Greatest Band To Ever grace my ears,"Nightwish Rules! The Music is spine tingling and melodic while powerful. Everything I thought I knew About Music has changed forever. As a long Time fan of Savatage, and other prog-metal bands.. Nightwish has become my favorite. I can play their music over and over... I never thought I would enjoy Opera but her voice seems to be meant for it...like we never should have had to listen to it any other way. The world is full of tasteless crap like eminem, and god please can we forget the boybands and all the other put together mindless gatbage we are smacked with by local radio. NIGHTWISH Thank you for the wonderful barrage of sound you have given to me. I still love my other-prog metal bands but Nightwish has something for everyone who enjoys ""TRUE"" Music. Death to the false ones! LOL"
5,The perfect formula still to be copied,"Nightwish works so near perfection! None of the other similar bands (Lacuna Coil, Sinergy, Stratovarius, Angra...) even approach this. No, Therion approaches. Many people tend to compare Nightwish to doom/goth metal bands such as Theatre Of Tragedy, Tristania and Sins Of Thy Beloved. Please, Nightwish is not doom/goth metal, it's clearly high level POWER METAL! Fast versatile guitar riffs, poignant ballads and above all, intense female vocals. Wishmaster's most touching moment is the gentle ""Two For Tragedy"", when Tarja's passionate lament reaches the soul of the listener. Other highlights are the fast ""Wanderlust"" and ""Crownless"". The last song, ""FantasMic"", is divided in three parts and is also very touching. Wishmaster and its predecessor Oceanborn are without a doubt essential albums for any metal listener..."
3,"Predictable,Boring, Stratovarius clown","Well...I heard so much about this CD, and i decided to give it a listen. As a power-metal guitarist, i can tell you that the only thing that stands out about this band, is Tarja's vocals. Music sounds like a predictable Yngwie or/and Stratovarius tune. After all, it's not a bad album, even though it'll become a shelf-material after a few spins. But if you are really looking for some good power metal, listen to Sinergy,Stratovarius,Rhapsody or even Armaggedon."
1,L T,Very disappointed with this one .Try their CDs Dark Passion Play and Once .They get five stars from me .
2,"interesting, but...","it's an interesting idea to have a operatic female vox in a metal band; however, her voice is mediocre (you'd know it's true if you know some names from the opera genre), and the music is not original at all. Does anyone know any similar bands (with operatic female vox) that are better than this? Let me know. Thanks!"
5,Nightwish is unique and rocks for eva,"Moi to you all,Nightwish est vraiment le plus cool des bands. Unqiue pis des tounes supers orginales, ca ma faite découvrir le métal pis aucune autre band ma faite vribrer comme eux. À tous le monde cest un must buy."
5,Why just 4 stars?,"Un album tout simplement renversant, extraordinaire, sensationnelle. Il est excellent sur toute la ligne avec une voix si bien cadré, si bien mis en evidence devenant la suite de se qu'ils avaient commencer avec Oceanborn, il revienne a la charge avec une disque presque aussi parfait. Un album tout comme le deuxieme, remplis de rebondissement, remplis de moment intense et de moment plus romantique avec Dead Boy's Poem qui est sans aucun doute la meilleur toute qu'ils ont faites. Souvent comparer a Dream Theater pour leur beat de piano, d'instrument progressif, ils ont sus selon moi allez une coche au dessus et nous offrir quelque chose d'encore superieur au membre de Dream Theater... En bref, il s'agit d'un CD dispendieux, mais combien il en vaut la peine, il est merveilleux et chaqu'un se doit de connaitre se magnifique groupe Allemand."
4,Just like the hospital and doc's clinic,"I bought 3 other types of thermometers -temporal scan, auxuliary thermometer (but), oral thermometer, but was getting tired of guessing her temperature. I just decided to purchase this one, the same one used by my hospital and personal doc. So happy to have peace of mind."
5,Welch Allen Suretemp Plus 690 Thermometer,"Finally got fed up with all small digital thermometers, none of which seem to be reliable, or require a full 3-4 minutes to be accurate, which is an aggravating long time for the (OB) patient. I LOVE this ""machine"", it is accurate and well worth the expense !"
3,Good device but yearly probe replacement required,"As a physician who has used many electronic thermometers, this one is about the best and fastest. It stands up to abuse well as my nurse has dropped it numerous times and it still functions fine. My only complaint(and the reason why I gave 3 stars not 5) is that the probe needs to be replaced regularly. I spoke with an individual in customer support who stated the average probe lasts approximately one year, then needs to be replaced(an error message comes up, rendering the unit unusable). The probe replacement is ~$85. I think that if you spend this amount of money on a thermometer, you should get more than a years use out of it before having to replace expensive parts."
3,Welch Allyn Suretemp Plus 690 Electronic Thermometer,"The thermometer is really good once you get it working. I was not very happy that I bought it ""Brand New"" and when I tried to use it, didn't work. I had to ship the Thermometer Probe back, then waited for a week, then tried again and still wasn't working, so I ended having to ship back the Thermometer with all accesories. It took a few weeks to get it back and working.Welch Allyn however, were very good at keeping the guaranty and sending back to me the thermometer after it was fixed."
5,"Great thermometer, long-lasting","We do home care for my dad and have to take his rectal temperature every 2 hours when we turn and re-position him. We have had the same Welch-Allyn Sure Temp 690 thermometer for 4 1/2 years now. We just replaced the well and probe a few months ago. The casing finally cracked after all of this time. We have only had to change the batteries twice, too. It is still working perfectly and we would recommend this thermometer to anyone who really needs to take temperatures often. It is so reliable. This one gets 5 stars!!!!!"
3,For aficionados only,"If you've not read any Lawrence this is not the book to start with. It fails as a novel because there is no story to speak of, just a string of scenes to initiate discussion of the issues Lawrence wished to explore. Apologists describe it as picaresque, but there is far more unity to most novels that deserve that descriptor. Nonetheless, there are wonderful scenes that fitfully jar this book to life, Lawrence's admirable command of language, and a brooding homoeroticism aching to burst out. Try this book after you've hit the major works (i.e. Women in Love, etc.)."
4,once put together..it's great!!,"This tent takes a little work to put together. I don't know what people are talking about when they refer to the wooden poles and getting splinters as the poles on mine are metal. Anyway, once put together it is quite cool! I am 5ft 9"" and I managed to be able to sit in it along with my 4 year old (sitting) and my 5month old baby (lay down) so there is plenty of space. I got mine on sale at a babies r us store, so I don't think I would actually pay (...)for it though. You could by a basic regular tent for that much!"
1,Broke in less then a month,"I bought this tent on 6/6/2005 for my 10 month old boy and used it once at the pool the rest of the time it sat in my dining room. I went to bed one night and it was up, but the next morning it was halfway down. When I went to see what was wrong I saw that one of the rods had snapped off in the metal holder and cannot be fixed. This could actually suffocate a baby if noone was in the room or the baby could hurt themselves if they found the broken rod. I was very disappointed because the size is great. I also agree with the other reviews it is hard to put together because the rods are so tight you have to have alot of strenth to get it set up. Please don't buy this we are going to return but it's such a hassle to spend 39.99 plus tax on something and it breaks in less then a month."
2,BORING...,"The information was worthwhile, but I found this video to be blah and boring. If you are going to bother to make a documentary at least make it somewhat entertaining! Add some interesting visuals and use a narrator that catches your attention. Read a book on this subject and by-pass this DVD."
5,A Great Documentary,this documentary tells you the relationship of Lewis Carroll and Alice Liddle. and also tells how alice in wonderland was created. this was a very intersting documentary. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
2,"This may be a shortened version of ""Howlin' Wolf Live Gold""","This CD looks to be a 9 track version of the Howlin' Wolf Live Gold CD (Fine Tune 2212-2) which has 14 tracks and appears to be available through Amazon Marketplace (the first nine tracks are in identical order on both CD's). From listening to the samples on Amazon the sound quality of the 9 track CD appears to be the same since as the Fine Tune version. The Fine Tune audio quality is not all that good, may not really be live, but it is the Wolf, after all. Thought fair warning was in order."
5,"Beethoven, Motzart, Sanford Townsend Band ........","Thats how music history books should be written, it was 1977, I first heard this album on a verandah overlooking the Indian Ocean in Perth Western Australia on a hot breezy Saturday evening watching the sun setting over the whitetops ..... WOW, what a old flashback that is, party goin on inside, my Triumph under the balcony, I got up, grabbed the keys, and went for a blast, that song has been a permanant source of pleasure in my old head for decades now .... mist in your eyes from the smoke of a distant fire.... da da da da ada, sounds even better with the exhaust note of a 750 Bonnie ... da da da da"
3,Looks Like I Backed Into a Square Deal,"I originally saw this band in Hollywood at The Roxy in 1977. They were virtual unknowns at the time, opening for Dion - of all artists! I owned the 12"" LP, but lost it somewhere in a move. I have been anxiously waiting for the release of this CD.Although Smoke From A Distant Fire is their best known hit (peaked at #9 in 1977), there are other strong tracks on this CD. Among them, ""In For The Night"" demonstrates the vocal range and songwriting abilities of both Ed Sanford and John Townsend.The lyrics are especially compelling. Most of the songs tell stories (a la Gordon Bok). Whether they be of love lost, love found or one of my favorites -- ""Lawdy Lou"", a story of a friend who loses another to an overdose -- they are presented along with compelling arrangements.This is late 70s pop-jazz, Steely Dan-inspired music at its best. Good lyrics, instrumentation. This is a ""musicians band"" if ever there was one."
5,The Witches' God by Janet and Stewart Farrar,This is a really good book for people that are studying the gods. I truely enjoyed this book. It was very informative.
