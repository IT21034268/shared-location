2,An Amazing life deserves a better telling,"Sidney Sheldon's book is so skimpy on the details that you are left wondering what the ""real"" story is. Even by the end of the book, I still didn't feel that I knew Sheldon.It's unfortunate that on the front coverr photo Sheldonappears to be giving his readers ""the finger."""
3,The reader falls off a cliff at the end.,"The pace of his book felt like going through one of his manic periods. The timeline keeps accelerating and accelerating, and the closer you get to the current era, the more and more he would just skim through things. He provides great detail about his parents and his early years, but he zips right through the 1970s in a couple of pages, covers his book career in barely that much, and covers most everything since 1979 in a quick epilogue. I felt strangely unsatisfied when I was finished reading it, and I wonder if he may have felt the same about the last quarter-century.I give it three stars because the story is very compelling into the 1960's - but it's a shame he didn't give the rest of his professional life since then the same depth of coverage."
3,wish there had been more info given,"ALthough the price was inexpensive, there was uncertainty when placing the order. I could not get information pertaining to whether or not this tape was a separate release by Jack Nicholas, or a portion of his GOlf My Way tape released on its own. Well, it turned out to be a small section of the original Golf My Way .............. which is one of other tapes I ordered at the same time. The third tape I ordered, Short Shots, was also a repackaged section of Golf My Way. So, actually, I would only have needed to order Golf My Way and neither of the other two. I feel I wasted my money on Control Shots and Short SHots. One thing I was looking for was the number of minutes of each tape ......... but, that was not listed in the product info."
3,Written by a Comedy Club Dropout,"I was really excited when I saw this and had it on my wish list before it came out. However, when I received it as a gift, I felt like a kid on Christmas morning who quickly learns that the race track that looked ""super cool"" on TV, sucks in reality. Kelby's writing is just like that toy - he can't seem to stay on track. What's even worse, and most annoying, are the juvenile jokes. This book should have been listed under humor (and bad humor at that). If I want funny, I'll watch reruns of Arrested Development. When I want technical information, I'll consider a different author. Unfortunately, I can't change my star rating from a 3 to a 1."
5,Best $20 I have ever spent,"I am a Graphic design student and consider myself in the upper amatuer catagory, before reading this book I knew how the channels worked and how to make basic masks. This book shows you how to make very complex masks very quickly, as well as grayscale conversions, spot colors and much more. Very easy to read compared to other books. Bar none the best $20 I have ever spent."
4,Somewhat frustrated,"Have you ever tried to use a PS filter, like ""Colored Pencil"", over a red channel of a duplicated background layer of a portrait psd file?Well, I must comment that I was expecting something quite close to that, a kind of testimonial book written by an artist to share some of his trade secrets, similar to the books of Caponigro in his Adobe Master Class series or Maggie Taylor's wonderful Landscape of Dreams.My mistake.Nonetheless, in spite its more conventional and technical goals, The Photoshop Channels Book is a helpful, well written, easy to follow book and certainly a pleasure to read. It is certainly more about ""alpha -channels"" and related useful layer techniques than those applied directly to R,G,B channels to amplify artistic modes of expression.Note about the style: Why is it that some Photoshop authors think they are some kind of TV comedians when they write technical books?"
3,Very Entry Level,"In all fairness, Scott made a good attempt to write his most entry level book I ever saw carrying his name. I think it will do fine for PS beginners and people who lack general understanding of channels and masks, and/or are kinda afraid of them. This book will bring them a peace of mind and in essence remove the topic of channels and masks from the ""uncharted territories"". However, if you did use both masks and channels consciously on your own even a couple of times - it will hardly teach you anything new..."
1,Serious Flaw,"I was expecting a substitute for the classic ""Photoshop Channel Chops"" by Monroy and friends. It trivializes the subject with ""How to unlock the hidden power of channels ... blah blah.If you want a better understanding of channels be prepared to wade through a lot of fluff with this one. Infomercial."
5,At last!!,"I've been waiting for this book for over a year, ever since it was first advertised with his PS for Photographers. I love channels and love what they can do. Finally a book that has all the basic information in one place. Other books just barely mentioned or gloss over channels.Now I can wade through the last part and reread the first part of Dan Margulis' book, Photoshop Lab Color, with Kelby's book at my side. Thought it was very nice of Mr. Kelby to acknowledge Margulis's book and pioneering work on channels."
4,Photoshop's Best Author,"Scott Kelby does it again, in his own humorous style! I can think of no other Photoshop author who uses illustration and clear, concise descriptions to demonstrate his techniques."
5,GREAT,"This book was great, like all of Terri Farleys a little creepier than the rest it kept me on the edge of my seat till 1:30 am. Scienctific Jen seems to have lost it by the end of this book I still really like it though. Another great one by Terri Farely!"
1,worked for only 10 minutes,"The chocolate fountain worked great at first (once we got the table level & added the proper amount of oil to the chocolate chips as mentioned in the instructions). About 10 minutes later, the auger just stopped turning, and the chocolate stopped flowing. I cleaned all the chocolate out, tried it with water and it turned. I made sure there weren't any chunks in the chocolate and tried it again and once again it wouldn't turn at all. All the teenagers at my daughter's 16th birthday party had been really excited about the fountain, and everyone was sad when it stopped working. Several days later We tried again with water and the auger turned, but with chocolate, it did not. I even tried the special Belgin fondue Chocolate (made for fountains) and that didn't work either. I have since returned it and am awaiting a refund."
1,Total Joke,"This item was a total flop. We bought this item for our wedding as a last minute decision and it arrived 2 days before the wedding. Once we opened the item and went through the parts list, we noticed that it was missing the auger that aggitates the chocolate. I went through the process here on amazon.com to return it, only to be told that we could not return this item. Amazon recommended we contacted the manufacturer and they informed us that they didn't have this part even available for individual distribution. So long story short, 50 something bucks plus shipping just to have a useless, incomplete fountain that we can't even return/sell or buy replacement parts for. This was actually my first item I ever bought through Amazon.com and I can say it will most likely be my last. Its a shame when you can find better customer service through individual-operated markets like ebay, craigslist than you can with an established, ""reputable"" online store like Amazon.com. :("
1,"Motor too slow, then burned out.","Junk!We melted, mixed and thinned the chocolate exactly per the directions enclosed. We leveled the unit with a bubble level.Problem:The unit uses and Archimedes screw to lift the liquid within the tower.The tower must be precisely fitted over the screw in order for the screw to turn freely; there is too much play in the Archimedes screw/motor shaft connection.That said, the motor turns too slowly to adequately lift the liquid; less than 2 RPM. We verified the screw was not bound and continued to let the motor run. Within 5 minutes, the motor failed. The chocolate had not hardened and was very free-flowingWe received the unit for Christmas 2007 and first used it July 26, 2008. We'll see if they honor the warranty which states 90 days from purchase, not 90 days from 1st use."
1,Wouldn't recommend,I expected a better fountain than what I got . I thought it was just a waste of money . So no I wouldn't recommend
3,It's ok,"The fountain works ok, is a little bit slow, but other than that it's good. One word of warning, MELT CHOCOLATE COMPLETELY BEFORE PUTTING IT IN THE FOUNTAIN! Otherwise it's a mess!"
3,Plastic fountain,I was under the impression that the fountain itself was going to be stainless steel but it is actually plastic. Never the less it is still a good fountain and worth the price.
1,The source this incomplete,Kit parts do not match the base. Buy the source and not operational. The purchases from Venezuela and I can not use it.
4,GREAT FOR CHEMISTRY STARTERS,Those of you who cannot understand chemistry either because the teacher does not know how to teach or you really do not want to listen...THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. The book is a nice manual for those who cannot comprehend chemistry. It will be like your virtual teacher in print. My only complain about this book is that it is too long. But at least it is comprehensive. And what I like most in this book is it is divided into many sections which made it easier to digest.
4,Very Good!,"This is my first book by this author. She's very good! Thea and Quinn were meant for each other. I think they wanted to be together intimately every time they saw each other because they were in love.Sheffield was a refreshing change. She was great, smart, beautiful, and very brave. Perry, her love, was the same. In fact, these two nearly stole the show!This book lacks one star because of the bland relationship between Thea and her aunt, Victoria. They were virtual strangers and had only an I-love-you-because-you're-my-relative relationship, because they certainly didn't know each other, didn't know anything about each other. I thought their relationship rather cold and merely polite. Both women had ample oportunity to share their fears and dreams with each other, but each declined, most often telling a lie to avoid conversation. Where was this supposed affection?"
2,"ok, but...","I purchased this vacuum a year ago after I my Fantom finally died on me. My panasonic is very disappointing. I purchased it after the salesman discouraged me from a Dyson due to price, stating this works just as well. My hose comes unattached for no reason while vacuuming, allowing everything being swept in, to come straight out and me having to do the whole thing again. It does not do stairs well and the attachments do not have much suction. Emptying the canister is a real mess since the filter is in the canister. The salesman told me to sweep the filter with a shop vac every time I empty the canister. What a mess!!This vacuum is lightweight and easy to use. For the first month, it was ok. Now, the honeymoon is over."
3,Broke,"This item is broke already. We barely had it, and it is already broke. The thing only works on carpet. The thing that you push down to do barefloor and attachments pops back up and will not stay down. Other than that, the vacuum was great. It is kind of heavy though. I hope you have a great new year."
4,Great crop of CIRCLES,"I got to hear Misty live in Salt Lake City. I enjoyed her accoustically, and have been listening to CD CIRCLES ever since.The melodies are great. Her smooth voice leads you through the smooth and rough tunes. I'm glad I picked it up and I look forward to seeing Misty play live again.The hidden track is awesome!"
3,"It's just aiight, nothing like the classic EPMD joints............","Erick succeeds in proving that he could sustain a career past his EPMD days, but that's about it. His glory days will always be when he paired with the ""Microphone Doctor"" Parrish Smith.Top Joints:Stay RealHostile (Keith Murray's debut)Hittin SwitchesAll In the Mind"
4,Hot debut! Heavy on the beats!,"I still remember Erick Sermon's first album, especially the blistering basslines in Stay Real. Sermon lashes at fake rappers who don't back up what they say. This song just jumps at you at first listen, as it has this funky, ballistic sound. Erick must have had the keyboards really revved up on this song--it's still one of my favorite solo songs from him! And once again, like in EPMD, Zapp and Roger Troutman are heavy sampled on this song. Also, another number, Hittin' Switches, has this truck-speakers blasting kind of music and beats as it leaps and bounces up and down in the chorus. He even lashes at his ex-EPMD member Parrish Smith, without saying his name on the song. The rest of the album is strong, as he has Redman and a group he found, Shadez of Lingo featured on some songs. Sermon proves that he could do it on his own outside of EPMD. His later albums got better."
4,HARD CORE,"CLASSIC.LYRICS ---------- 10/10PRODUCTION COURTESY OF GREEN EYED BANDIT -------- 10/10THEME --------- 10/10ALBUM COVER --------9/10CONCEPT ---------- 10/10GUEST APPEARANCE --------- SHADES OF LINGO,KEITH MURRAY&RED; MANSTAND OUT TRACKS ---------- ALL TRACKSOVERALL ---------- CLASSIC.O.KAKA GOD'S GIFT TO DA UNDERGROUND."
4,BET in 1993,"I remember Erick Sermon being on Rap City when this came out. They interviewed him from this new house he had bought in Atlanta. He had a drum kit in his studio and he played it while rappping ""Stay Real."" I think Reggie ""Redman"" Noble showed up on that episode too. BET was still good back then."
4,Raw but not rough,"Having read the previous reviews, I almost did not buy this album. Even what Juliana herself had written on her webpage did not encourage me. It is not as lo-fi as everybody seems to think. Ok it has a rawer sound and more edge than some of her recent stuff but it is still very good. Ths ound is not that bad and it does not seem to be that cheaply made at all. OK, she plays with lots of distortion but she allways has done that. The songs are very beautiful and she really come across as one of the ebst songwriters around."
5,No glossy production here...,"Juliana Hatfield is a very interesting artist that is just fascinating to watch evolve. 2004's In Exile Deo was a 4-star record that finally helped her recover from some of the prior records that were less impressive (Bed, Total System Failure).But Made In China is the complete opposite of In Exile. Here Juliana totally revamps her sound and really this doesn't sound like any of her other work. I have only had this album for a few weeks and I like it better than her 90s masterpiece ""Become What You Are"". But then again maybe I'm a bit biased because I love the lo-fi sound.It's nice to see an artist who changes styles and experiments and I know I'll be more than happy to see what Hatfield comes up with in the future."
3,Made my family life seem normal,"The intriguing story of an eccentric and dysfunctional family written solely from the perpsectives of two surviving siblings. Given the extreme sacrifices her mother and especially Hilary made for her, I would imagine Jackie to be an extraordinary personality. Unfortunately, there's not much evidence of that in this book. Personally, I didn't find her very likable, intriguing or sympathetic. It does, however, successfully portray her to be an incredible musician. Part of the problem I may have had with this book is that I have no musical abilities (or much interest), so the ""brillance"" of her personaltiy was mostly lost on me. And I can't imagine it was intentional, but I thought Kiffer came off looking like a big jerk. It might have been a better story if written by a more objective author who wrote from a variety of perspectives. Still it was interesting and must have taken a lot of courage to write."
2,tuffyb has got it in a nutshell.,"I agree with tuffyb who said it's a tedious book and it is. The family background is far too long, involved and frankly, uninteresting. Also, I have no desire to know that Jacqueline du Pre slept with her brother-in-law, among the many things in this hatchet job of An Intimate Memoir!I prefer to remember her on the concert stage making her unique music.However much the hurt, some things are best left unsaid and unprinted outside the immediate family circle. Truly.We still have Jacqueline du Pre's recordings and that's all we need now."
1,Jealousy reigns,"If you know music you know that Jacqueline du Pre was a genius. The running trope in this book is that her sister could have been her equal if only their parents had paid her the same amount of attention. Because the sister is clearly delusional on the issue of relative degrees of talent, you cannot trust any of the other supposed facts in this book. If you want to appreciate Jacqueline du Pre listen to her music and watch the videos of her playing. You will get nothing worthwhile from this sour tale of envy."
2,"Mugs, Jackables and Hil--UGH!","I read this book cover to cover because I was really interested in Ms. Du Pre, but it was really hard to stomach the cutesy names and the generally smarmy tenor--I guess it's hard for family members to be objective, but if I have to read one more time about these 2-dimensional beings ""dissolving"" into giggles, I'm going to gag."
3,Mean spirited at best,"This book is the ""Mommy, Dearest"" for the cello set. This biography, written by Jacqueline Du Pré's sister and brother is Jackie's life as seen through the eyes of her siblings. Unfortunately, they are very jealous and, I think, petty relatives. According to this book, Jackie was a genius, but selfish, self-centered and an all-around not nice person. On the other hand, Hilary and Piers were giving and, consequently, martyred, all for the talent of Jacquelyn Du Pré. If you're in the mood for a really mean-spirited look into this cellist's life, this is the book you've been looking for!"
3,du Pre's amazing story overcomes the book's flawed writing,"I got this book for free when I bought the soundtrack to the movie. A good thing because the cliched writing and endless descriptions of idealized bacon and egg breakfasts made for tedious reading. But it's worth slogging through just to learn about the wonderful musical genius Jacqueline du Pre. In my memoir Project Girl I describe the burden of the ""girl genius"" and could relate so personally to Jacqueline's isolation and arrested emotional development. As much as they try to write away their guilt it is obvious from the book that both her sister and brother failed her consistently. It should be read if only if it inspires you, as it has me, to immediately order her CDs and a video tribute to her."
3,The cost of Genius?,"Although a very badly written book I find myself forgiving the authors thier lack of literary expertise in their bravery in tellling this tale. They didn't have to. One can't help but wonder if the ""devotion"" of the mother somehow served to create the twisted and unhealthy family life these people found themselves a part of. Would this great genius have emerged if Jackie's mother had not completely subjugated her life and that of the other members of this family for the sake of one member and if so was it worth it? I'm not sure. That every member automatically accepted without question the fact that everything was for Jackie at any cost to themselves is very disturbing. What a price to pay. Perhaps there's lesson here. We benefited buat what cost. I do, as I say applaud Hilary and Piers and I'm pleased that they waited and sincerely hope they have been able to overcome this tragedy."
3,This's way too private to let people know such a story...,"For those who love Jackie, now can find out another side of her life and her family that can't be found in other books. Though it is quite nice, though it is touching indeed, but by knowing a person in such way won't have any benfits to her extraordinary performance in cello but want to know more about her private life, is that good? or just good for money?"
2,Watch the Movie,"I think this is one of those rare times when the movie was better than the book. If you want a less dramatic version of the movie, read the book. Skip the parts written by Piers, it's a distraction from the main story. After all, it's called Hilary and Jackie, not Hilary, Jackie, and Piers."
1,"BIA Cordon Bleu 2-Quart Souffle, White","When I received my package,I lifted the box containing the BIA Cordon Bleu 2-Quart Souffle and it rattled like a piggy bank full of coins. I was afraid to open it. The souffle dish was obviously smashed to bits. I did not even look at the contents of the box.I returned it for a refund. I wanted to rate it ""no"" stars, but that is not an option in the rating system; the minimum is 1 star, so that is the rating I gave it. I think other reviewers reported the same problem."
1,Good sound but bad glitches,"My stereo makes a terrible alarm sound regularly and will not turn off, have to reset it. Happens every hour."
1,Dissappointed,"I bought the 820HD and it will not receive an FM stations at all. I called Cambridge to get a replacement, but they forwarded my contact and order information to another company and told me the other company would contact me later. They would not ship out replacement. They must be having big problems with 820HD. So much for the 30 day no hassle money back guarantee."
2,Not for bedroom use,"I agree with the other reviews here regarding audio quality. However, and it's a big however, the display is EXTREMELY BRIGHT. It's NOT suitable at all for use as a bedroom clock radio, which is why I bought the radio. It lights up a room more than a child's night-light -- you can almost read by the light! Further, there's no brightness control (automatic or manual). There is a contrast control, but it's not a substitute. For all its brightness, the words on the display are also completely illegible if viewed from an extreme angle (like if the clock is on top of the headboard above a bed). You have to sit up in bed to read the clock.Bottom line, if the brightness of the display were adjustable, I give it 5 stars. Minus at least 3 stars (if not all 5) for the brightness."
3,Have developed a love-hate relationship,"We have had our Creative Labs Onyx Cambridge Soundworks Radio for about six months now and have developed a love-hate relationship with it. For each plus there seems to be a counterbalancing minus.On the plus side: Cool looking, decent sound, easy to program, great to be able to pull in HD signals from stronger stations, scrolling display in HD, auxiliary input for iPod, easy- to-use controls.On the minus side: Very heavy and plastic casing (for this type of money, it should be cast aluminum, not plastic--imagine dropping it on a tile floor), bright LED display (as noted by others), signal drift and over sensitivity to weather, white remote with a black radio, flimsy antennas, better grip or even a handle for moving (we move it around as this is the only HD radio in the house)."
3,As an HD Radio it is OK but it fils as a clock rado,"It does HD very well if only because Cambridge had the good sense to include multiple antennas. Go right for the Diapole. Note that the display is awfully bright and there is no way to control that. Also the alarm allows you to use radio or tone BUT if you use radio, you cannot use an HD station to wake you up. HELLO CAMBRIDGE, people who buy HD radios do so because they want to listen and be woken up by HD stations"
2,"Missing several songs from latest CD, no video playlist","Overall the DVD is ok, but missing some songs from the Irresistible CD -- it does not have the video for There You Were (the duet with Marc Anthony) and doesn't have the video for What's It Gonna Be.Also, if you want to just see the music video tracks and skip the documentary part of the DVD, you have to keep jumping back to the chapter list or use track search on your DVD player to hop forward. (The documentary and video tracks are mixed together).The first time you watch it is fine the way it is, but after the first time you want to just watch videos and have to jump around the DVD."
4,Good but could have been better,"This DVD is good, but could have been a little bit longer. It contains a lot of interwievs with Jessica wich are very good and informative and behind the scens of the videos from irrisistible album. The videos are great because she added all of them, but unfortunately there is only one song performed live here. It""s the song Irrisistible captured from the MTV spring break. Extras for the DVD are bad. She just added biography and discography. All in all good, but I hope that her next will be better and more interactve."
1,Worst DVD...,"It really stunk, the only good part was when nick lachey and jessica were recording other then that it stunk. DO NOT GET IT!"
1,"Shame on you, Hasbro.","The figure is great, but I'm rating Hasbro's choice to pocket more money by not including parts and paint. They could have at least changed the pic on the box so we wouldn't know what we were missing. Even the coloring is darker and not as cool as the original japanese version."
4,Overall good transformer,"Pros: unique vehicle mode design, gears and such can be seen, possibly as proof of the character's older age; robot mode believable as being an old, wise, intelligent warriorPros or Cons: simple transformation; color scheme not the same as the picture (example, the picture has brown edges on the wings)Cons: wings are flexible and will warp out of shape if laid on; in vehicle mode, the bottom (robot's legs) have trouble staying in place"
5,I am not woring about the colors!!,I think he is a gerat toy even if he is not completely colorded. He is one of the greatist since G1 transformers. Get him now!!!
4,a cool toy to own,Well once I saw this online I said I must own one. This is vector prime a diffrent prime name and different look to the toy. even the new primes look great. I wish they had a picture for megatron.
3,Good and Bad,"In Root Shock, Mindy Fullilove investigates the devastating and long lasting effects of urban renewal, mainly in the Lower Hill District. In my opinion, the book drags on in a dramatic and one-sided manner. Although the book does give various interesting statistics, it is hard to connect all the different perspectives. Despite the book's one-sidedness, Fullilove's message in strengthened by the personal accounts that she shares of those who have experienced ""root shock"" firsthand."
2,Adequate Book,"Root shock was an okay of a book. It was very one-side; Fullilove never considered the other point-of-view. She also attempted to capture the reader's attention by supplying the readers with full size pictures that took up an entire page; however, she failed to get our attention. The urban renewal process is interesting, but she took so much credit for supplying the information, when in reality, it was the interviews that supplied the information about the process of urban renewal. The book was okay, but it can be skipped."
3,A different view on Urban Planning,"The reason I like this book is because it is different from other books on urban planning and urban 'renewal'. If you have read more than 2 books on urban renewal, you notice they start to sound the same! So Fulliove, being a psychiatrist and not an urban planning professional, brings a different, fresh perspective to the issues.That being said, I do question some of her assertions, which is why I don't rate the book with more stars. For one, referring to the 1967 Newark riots as 'insurrections'. It was a riot!Also, she sidesteps the positive affects of urban renewal.Lastly, I question whether it was urban renewal that lead to the downfall of the inner city communities, as Fullilove asserts, or the breakdown of the family. The issues are all intertwined, but I personally don't buy her arguments that urban renewarl was the main cause."
2,SoftWorks 4-piece Nylon Flexible Tool Set,"These look really nice, but they do not work out to well. They melt very easily. Even something as basic as cooking eggs they start melting at the tips. Overall not a very good buy. Nylon Pie Server works fine though."
2,Mostly just bad,"This movie has very little to offer to the viewer other than an odd, unsatisfying experience. It is strange and unique in its quirkiness. But the production qualities are really very poor, especially in the acting, story and music. The grainy focus and limited views were obviously chosen to give the film a particular look, but quickly became annoying. The primarily silly (and only rarely funny) story failed to provide any real entertainment. The satire, where it existed, was obvious and simplistic. The lack of consistently good quality music of various styles was surprising. If you like quirky movies of a similar style that truly entertain, try Cory McAbee's The American Astronaut."
3,Strange.,Suffice to say this is one of the best movies ever about a pair of glass legs filled with beer.Hands down.
1,Not worth seeing twice,"I rented this movie after having had a recommendation to do so. But it turned out to be very disappointing, confusing, ridiculous, and extremely strange. Yes, there is some humor (the glass beer filled legs deserve some credit and the various countries performing can be funny too), but all in all, the only line worth remembering is the very last line of the movie. You won't be missing much if you miss this movie."
3,The strangest movie in the world,"The premise: would-be minstrels gather in Winnipeg in 1933 for the ""Port Huntley Lager Saddest Music in the World"" contest, intended to bring levity to the ""saddest city in the world"" at the height of the great depression, and sell a few beers along the way. I think the braintrust behind this film had a few too many Port Huntley lagers when they were coming up with this one. A bizarre movie with a generally incomprehensible plot, made interesting by the 1930s era stylings of the visuals - part silent flic, part surrealism, part Movietone News reel. Goofy, entertaining performances abound, particularly by Rosselini as the legless beer magnate. I can't really say that I liked it, but I was certainly intrigued enough to keep watching."
1,Terrible,I thought this movie was absolutely terrible - almost a parody of itself. I can't understand why I chose to order it.
2,I stayed for the music.,"First off, I'm not a real fan of the surrealistic genre. Frankly I was drawn in by the the title (& Isabella Rosselini). I can see the appeal of this type of movie, it's just not my style. The musical interludes were the best part & weren't particularly sad. The acting was wooden & stiff & maybe that's the point I missed. A movie doesn't have to be good to be a cult classic & that's where I see this movie heading. The short after the movie ""Sissy Boy Slap Party"" was hilarious & irresistible. I watched that twice."
5,A film hommage to an over used genre: Romantic Drama!,"The idea itself is wonderful! A pub in a small town of Saskatchewan during the depression suffers from the lack of customers who cannot afford beer anymore. So the owner starts a competition of the saddest music of the world, because when you are sad you tend to drink a lot more...The visual is fantastic, very ""cinématographe"" approach with the balck and white and the overblown grain of the photography. Even the lighting reminds us of Von Sternberg with Marlene Dietrich.The actors are brilliants. The writing is such as the actors have to play a incongruous emotion to the action they're doing. It gives a peculiar atmosphere to the movie.The artistic choice of using everything (and I mean everything) of the old cinema as an hommage is a very good choice and over using it is part of the humor of the film.It is funny and weird. I just loved it!"
5,Canada?,"Yes, okay, there is sometimes quite a margin between conception and execution of the surreal imagery. Understood. The characters operate mostly on the level of ""types"". Understood. Resultantly, it is as camp and kitsch as anything you've probably seen. Understood. It is most times overbearingly mystifying and ""artsy""(that word...). Understood. I suppose that if you've read enough about it to be intrigued enough to consider buying it, you already know if its for you or not."
5,Dame's got a glass leg filled with beer!,"Madin makes good stuff, but you have to be open to the fact that you might hate it, and that's ok."
2,"Carlson's 6th attempt, and it's still not that great.","Although at times a pretty good introductory text, Physiology of Behavior is often incorrect or too vague to be of use. Text is often written quite informally and in the first person. Maybe good for really advanced high-school psychology classes. Overall - weak."
3,ok,the book came in a reasonable amount of time but was not the same quality as was initially stated. It said the book was brand new but it had bent corners.
3,Good effort [Three stars out of Four] By fellow Revisionist A. Allen,"Andrew went with David McCalden to Auschwitzand they were the first Revisionists to puttogether a video there before Fred Leuchter,Jr. and David Cole. This book is a good in-sider's look at the College edjumacationracket!"
3,Not great for personal security,"It is loud, but what looks like a button on the front is a speaker, the button to push is on the back. It's small and is the same shape as the button for the light so you can't access it quickly unless you are holding the alarm in your hand. The light is barely bright enough to light up my basement."
1,Not loud enough.,"I bought these as stocking stuffers for my three adult daughters, hoping they would help to keep them safe when alone, but they are basically just toys. While they sound loud when activated in the house, they don't sound loud enough to draw much attention when outdoors. I would not depend on these to be of much help so I guess 100 decibels is not enough."
5,"Water Water everywhere, and not a drop in my mask!","Bought this mask for myself and my wife, very simple adjustment system, and just a beautiful fit. NO LEAKING, GREAT EXPANDED VIEWING AREA, I'd say get it! No, seriously, go ahead - get it."
5,Great mask,"I don't know if my head/face is considered to be big or small (23'', 58.4 cm). Own the same model but with black skirt, pretty happy with it (mask and head:). But you definitely want to try how it fits your face before buying one."
2,Not for every one,"This was my first time ordering mask over the net, i believe masks need to be tried at store before you buy them.And i was right. this mask did not fit my face shape, you need to have medium or perhaps small size face in order to find this mask useful with no leakage. the material of this mask seems alright, the inner liner is not complete therefore its even harder to keep the water out.i woud not recommend this to any one, unless you try it first."
2,Unfortunate,"Visitors to your home shouldn't be allowed to roam the kitchen. They might take your hard-working Russell Hobbs electric kettle, fill it, then put it onto the gastop to cook. Plastic melts quickly.Replaced that no-longer-available RH model with the Capresso glass. Goes like this:One star because it boiled water quickly.One star because it was fun watching the water come to a boil.The problems:It didn't click off automatically, which I considered unimportant because you could see when the water was ready;andIt's a boiling-water dribbler during a pour;andIt quit working after five uses, which makes the dribbling problem moot.Cleverly, I threw away all the packaging after the first successful use, my problem when it comes to returning for credit."
4,Excellent,"This kettle is great !I have tried several other brands , borrowed from friends to try etc. I got this as a gift and have been very pleased. I had hemmed and hawed for some time about getting an electric kettle - one more thing to question if I really needed or not ! This kettle is quiet, heats very quickly and looks (to my eye at least) much better than any of the others. Did I need an electric kettle? No, probably not. Am I glad I got one ? Yes, very definately. If you are going to have one why shouldn't it be nice to look at too !"
1,Talks a good game but doesn't deliver,"It is hard to know what to say about this book. The first fify pages were the most invigorating I have read in a long time, full of interesting characters and observations as well as tremendous wit. I could hardly wait to read on, but as I did, I began to grow disappointed and eventually ran out of enthusiasm. I plodded to the end but it was heavy going. The novel-within-a-novel concept can work under certain circumstances but this is not one of them. The excerpt from the character Garcia's novel added nothing and were an irritating distraction from the main event. Alfau would have benefitted from having a good editor. All in all, an idea with enormous potential that starts off brilliantly but fades all too quickly."
1,Not Much Substance - Not Worth the Money,"I just don't get these positive reviews, and I hate to break up the party. At least with Schienfeld's ""Busting Loose"" book, there was an attempt at explanation and an offering of some support for his interesting and provocative, if not utterly ridiculous, idea that we create by force of will our own reality. What is sold as a book here is nothing more than a magazine article."
3,Good product but be careful,"It seems like Sandisk is using some clever pricing mechanisms. Their ultra CF, which is more expensive, is right on par or below the CFs available from e.g. Viking, Simpletech. etc. While Sandisk standard CF is way below par.Bottomline, Ultra from Sandisk is equal in performance to regular CFs from other vendors. Clever marketing !!"
3,Not any better than a regular Sandisk 256MB card,"I have a nikon coolpix 4300, and I own both the regular and the Ultra versions of Sandisk's 256MB compact flash. I can tell no difference whatsoever in the speeds. I've even tried timing them. The adds about the Ultra being faster and better for someone shooting a moving object convinced me to buy it, but i really don't think it was worth the extra money. Save your money or purchase a brand with speeds proven to be significantly better than a regular sandisk compact flash card."
3,Mixed bag,"The card isn't compatible with my Sandisk card reader, but other than that I'm impressed with it."

5,A Nice Road Trip Through Europe? Not For These Three Guys!!,This is a wonderful Horror novel full of surprising twists and turns. Professional car thief Paul Dekker is having nightmares about a woman who died and is now an Angel or so he thinks. He flees to Europe where an Army of reanimated bodies try to hunt him down. He is joined in this search for the woman by his two friends Jake and Double A (Anthony Anthony) a car mechanic who is addicted to speed. What follows is a marvellous road trip through Europe and the reader feels as if he is in the car with Paul and his buddies. This is an indication of just how well this book is written. The characters are complex and the story takes the reader on one heck of a ride in a 1959 Popular with a tweaked and tuned up Rover V8 engine.
3,Long and kind of floppy,"I use it, but not as often as I thought I would. Good for omelets and pancakes. It is kind of long and floppy. Does not feel quite ""right"" in my hand. I suppose I will get used to it."
1,Annoyingly floppy,This turner is so flexible that it is next to useless. Anything of any weight just bends the turner. I'm still trying to figure out a use for it since it has been pretty worthless so far.
2,Ridiculously huge,I wish they gave more measurements here. The flipping silicon surface is actually like 6 inches long. It's just too unwieldy to use effectively.
2,too floppy,"This thing needs to be stiffer for the size it is. As it is it is TOO bendable and ends up being floppy. I can't use it to cook an omelet or flip a pancake.I have a smaller version OXO Silicone Turner, and that one is great. I was very disappointing in this one that we find almost useless. It will push scrambled eggs around in the pan - but be careful trying to use it to scoop those eggs out of the pan with it."
4,omlette,"its a spatulae made of silicone ..dose not scratch nonstick surfaces ..great for flipping omlettes , crepes and even fish ..works well does not stick to the food being flipped and does not melt when left in the pan"
3,"Good quality, but HUGE","It's really good quality, but the picture doesn't really show you how big this thing is! I can only use it with my larger saute pans."
2,Too floppy,"I usually like the Oxo products, but this spatula is not good. It's very large and way to flexible. It works OK for omelets, but is pretty much useless for anything else. If you try to use it for anything that weighs more than 1-2 ounces, it can't withstand the weight. I am looking for a new spatula."
2,"Too big, too floppy","I don't agree with the other reviews. I was disappointed. It's too large to handle a small omelet in a small pan, and it's really TOO flexible to be very strong. My husband is ready just to chuck it away."
1,Very disappointed,This product is too floppy. I tried it out and the eggs fell back into the pan because it won't hold many weight. It would make a nice expensive fly swat. This baby is heading to Goodwill when I make my yearly donations.
2,Ow. Not for those with sensitive eye area.,"These goggles dig into the skin around your eyes - there is no padding at all, just the plastic rim. I couldn't even wear them once. If you aren't sensitive in this way, then these may work for you. They do look like they are manufactured well."
2,Indicative of what's to come?,"Musically, there is very little on the Go-Betweens' debut album to suggest any riches to come, or, for that matter, to mark them out from the post-punk/New Wave-giving-onto-indie-rock early-80s pack. It's all tight, rhythmic drive, where everything - drums, vocals, guitars, bass - are inseperable from the general, homogenous, grey effect. This setting is perhaps appropriate for some squirmingly honest lyrics, whose very precision in charting quick-switch moods point to the Go-Between's future.There are four songs that make the album worth listening to - 'One thing can hold us', the nearest thing to a tune; 'Midnight to neon', with its violent saxophone explosion; the proto-Pulp epic 'Eight Pictures', an uncomfortably comic story of voyeurism and violation; and 'Careless', with a guitar solo that lights up the album like a flare in the night."
4,Good review of all phases of managing your business,"This is a compilation of a few dozen Journal of Light Construction articles on managing your business. It covers advertising, estimates, bidding, profit/overhead, contracts, etc, with many examples and reviews of different systems. A good book to get a quick look of all phases of the management cycle."
4,A classic in cosmology,"Originally published in 1934, this Dover reprint covers the early development of cosmology in a rigorous mathematical format. You need to know math through tensor equations (as you would for any rigorous treatment of cosmology), and this probably should not be anyone's first foray into cosmology. For that, see Peebles. Having said that, this gives sidelights present nowhere else, and a fine treatment of some by-passed cosmological models."
4,hoist,This hoist is being used for a dumbwaiter at a beach house. It is just what we needed and at a very affordable price.
3,much installion required,"i had no idea that it required its own hoisting divice. i will have to hire someone to bulid a pole for me, or wait until springtime."
4,much worth than I expected!!,"U only paid $60.....what did u expected? well...I didnt expect much from this little one machine. however, it had been 3 weekd since i received it and it worked very well!! only cost 2 mins to make one excellent coffee and beautiful foam, even less than u spend time going to coffee shop, right?the only reason i gave it 4 stars, instead of 5 stars, is that the frother/steamer cant be adjusted. sometimes it is unconvient to use it.anyway....coffee taste good!! compared to starbucks....haha~~"
4,So far so good,This is my first expresso..so far so good..no complaints at this time..works good..steam works good..I am still trying to perfect me cafe mocha..everything good !
5,"Easy, and saving big bucks","With some practice, (the enclosed video is worth watching) and some good coffee beans, I have come close to duplicating my local coffee shop's latte and cappuccinos. Fairly easy to clean and is a improvement from a Krups I owned for years. All in all, a good deal for $50"
1,Started out good...for two weeks,For two weeks this machine worked good. Then slowly it started to fail. And this was only making one to two cups a day. Going back!
2,Average results - burned flavor,"I am a big fan of espresso and espresso drinks but needed to save money so I bought this to make it at home. Making espresso is easy enough if you follow the instructions (I didn't watch the video). The frother even works well. The problem I had was with the flavor. The manual suggests making two or four shots of espresso at a time, but when making four shots the espresso was badly burned by the time it was finished brewing. I had best results making just over one shot at a time, but the flavor was still burned and flat. In the end, I used the machine for a couple months but eventually put it away and went back to my regular drip coffee maker."
1,Broke after 2 weeks,First of all if you try to make 4 cups at a time it does not produce crema. After approximately 10 uses the knob broke.
4,Excellent machine for two cups,"This is a terrific, inexpensive little machine, perfect for a crowded countertop. The espresso is terrific, I agree with another reviewer that if you use Starbuck's coffee, the espresso tastes exactly like Starbuck's (I'll add that we use distilled water).Two little problems. First, the steamer basket only had about half the holes punched all the way through. But Capresso customer service was terrific and sent a replacement basket in less than a week.Second problem is that the espresso steam gets too hot after 2-3 cups; we can't get more than that without the espresso burning and tasting bitter. 2 cups is perfect everytime, 3 cups is borderline, 4 cups impossible.Still, for us it's proven well worth the money for our household."
2,does not meet expectations,"I read everyone else's reviews, got excited about my little espresso machine, received it, watched the little video, etc... and now i'm very disappointed.First off, the espresso is NOT frothy. I do not think the machine gets to a high enough temperature, but i was willing to let that go... since it was only $59.99. I was going to keep it, but then, less than a week into use (one cup a day), the rubber ring in the water resevoir came off... and when brewed the next cup, it did not provide a sufficient seal... and now it's kaput!Now I have to go through the hassle of returning and researching another coffee maker! So, please save your time and money and look elsewhere is my advice... it sounds like the machine is decent if you get lucky, but the consistency of the quality is poor."
5,essellent esspresso,"I had recently purchased the new Mr. Coffee pump esspresso maker for 89.99 and hated it! the esspresso tasted like mediocre coffee. So, I spent another 49.99 on the Caspresso and am totally satisfied. It is easy to use, and produces that wonderful full bodied rich esspresso that I crave everyday at ""Latte Time!"""
3,"good price, good espresso, some problems","The Caparesso is easy to use but does have a few gliches. One is the seal on the cap/cover that is supposed to keep the steam in the boiler compartment. I have had to tighten the cap more after I noticed that steam is escapeing in the middle of a brew, trying to be careful not to burn myself. The other issues are trying to dump grounds out of the coffee holder (you have to keep your thumb on a lever that holds the coffee ground cup while you turn the cup upside down to knock the grounds out- almost impossible to do), the frother makes more of a mess then it's worth using. I microwave the milk to warm it instead of using the frother. Other then the above it's not a bad machine, and alot easier to use that a ""pump"" driven machine."
1,DO NOT BUY A MINI-S,"This machine--the Capresso Mini-S,(according to phone product support) ""is not designed to brew the second two shots as well as the first two. Continuing: ""Perhaps you are confusing this machine with a true pump machine. This machine uses the old-fashion steam method; the steam gets hotter and hotter.... You should only brew 2 shots at a time if you do not like the taste of the second two shots.""I returned the machine because the ""hotter"" steam begins to burn the coffee grounds as the brew proceeds to the third shot. The resultant smell and coffee taste is badly fouled-burnt. Apparently, this is part of the design, which the people at Capresso describe as ""the normal operation of the machine."" When the machine is returned to me, I will be discarding it.FYI, at the time of this writing, Capresso's website was down. I'm wondering if they are actually in business. Just be wary of this company, their products, and their product support."
4,Amazing little machine,"First of all, this tiny appliance is extremely light and hardly occupies any counter space. Very compact.2. Hooking it up is very straightforward.3. Brewing starts in about 30 seconds and in less than a couple of minutes, there is enough steam built up to steam the milk.4. The tiny machine produces enough steam to really heat up the milk, without having to use the microwave. This is one thing that my other cheaper machine could never do. I always had to heat up the milk in the MW before frothing. Kudos for that.5. I even tried using the steamed milk directly with instant coffee and it just tastes amazing. :)My one complaint - steaming is a little noisy, as if it is going to blow up any minute. A little unnerving in a quiet house."
4,Comments after using this machine for over a year,"This machine has performed its duty at my home on a daily basis for over a year. It makes a great shot of espresso and has saved me tons of money over buying mocha lattes at the coffee shops! I am not a coffee expert, but I LOVE my mocha lattes:)The instructional video is VERY helpful.However, I only gave it (4) stars for the following reasons:1. It tends to only make (1) serving of espresso per brew, the rest is burned and very bitter (not a big deal for users such as myself making enough for one coffee drinker each morning)2. I actually had to send in my machine for service just before the one-year mark--I was unable to get even one serving of espresso out before it began to steam and burn the batch. I cannot say anough about the WONDERFUL service at Capresso!! They repaired the machine and all I paid was the shipping to return it to them.Despite the setback, I would purchase this item again--you cannot beat the price!"
3,Decent espresso machine.,"For the money, this espresso machine performed adequately. It ended up lasting around 10months for me. After that, it started burning the espresso much faster and I was never able to get more than 2 shots of espresso at a time. Also, if you like your espresso hot, you had better drink it fast. This machine tended to make it just more than lukewarm. If you just want a little economical machine that won't take up much space, though, the capresso will suit your needs just fine."
4,Very pleased,"We purchased this machine a couple months ago after our previous one, a Krupps, gave out suddenly (and explosively). The Capresso is a little more compact than the Krupps, but still makes a great cup of espresso. We aren't 'purists', so issues like the lack of crema that some here are complaining about do not concern us. We just like a hot fresh cup of espresso with some cream and milk.Update 7/6/2008:After a couple years of daily use (up three batches a day, every day), the unit gave out. Not sure exactly happened, it just doesn't turn on any more. We decided to try a similarly priced DeLonghi, but are very unhappy with it, and have decided to return it. We will go back to this product."
5,Absolutely Love it......(so far)!!!,"This espresso/cappuccino machine works like a charm! Of course, I've only been using it for about a week now. The below average reviews I read before I bought this product in general complained about it dying on them after a few months of use! So, if you don't see a follow up it means it's still going strong!As for the machine, I love the taste of freshly brewed espresso and the cappuccino I can make at home. Like that Master-Card ad says - Cost of the machine $xx.xx......cost of the coffee grounds - $yy.yy......cost of the paper towel to clean up the mess after the brewing process - &0.zz.......cost of enjoying a hot refreshing cup of espresso/cappuccino/mocha/what ever it is that you like with in the comfort of you house - PRICELESS (with a halo on my head and a huge smile on my face)!!!Hope the halo doesn't turn into horns and the the smile into a frown anytime soon!"
4,Great........Sometimes,"Alright, Ive had this machine for abbout a year. I clean it all the time, and use it 1-2 times a day. Since it is steam powered, it isnt that great, but does make a good crema every 1 in 5 tries. It takes a long time to put the ground coffee in, water, etc. Also beware: if you don't de pressurise the machine, it will fill thw whole room with steam and spit hot water everywhere (from experience!!). So beware, but this machine is a perfect start for a beginner."
5,Good old Russian recipes,I got this DVD to try out some of the recipes that my Babushka used to cook when she was alive. The video was easy to follow and to the point. It was a good nostalgic feeling to cook these Russian foods. Baleshoe spaceba.
4,Very Helpful,I liked the numerous practice exams. Also gave some really helpful ideas on how to memorize addresses and address checking. This is the only book you'll need.
3,Another gem from an underrated songwriter!,"McClennan turns out another fine album of hook-filled, playfully honest songs. This one is more organic-sounding than his earlier 'Watermark' and spunkier than the later 'Horsebreaker Star'. Missteps are few (skip 'The Pawnbroker') and brilliance is prevalent ('Surround Me' has one of the best hooks of the decade, and 'The Dark Side of Town' and 'When I Close My Eyes' are beautiful and earnest). There's a warmth, melodicism, and blunt wit about McClennan's music that is instantly engaging. Spin this a few times and you'll be out hunting for his other great CD's!"
1,THIS SHOULD BE OUT OF THE MARKET,"I bought this battery nearly 10 month ago.It does not fit well in the Olympus 770. To take the battery out of the camera you really need to be lucky. It gets stuck inside the camera battery and to take out is like a lottery ""you never know.Battery life, is like half to 7% of what you can get from the original that comes whith the camera."
5,Soft Claws Work,"Soft Claws are cheaper than Soft Paws, but are by the same company. I have one cat who fights and these claws keep the other cats safe. Monthly I have to have a couple replaced at a time, but they are worth it. I would not be able to manage the situation without them."
5,Excellent!,"I have two cats that currently wear these, both of which I started having them wear them as kittens. I refused to declaw my cats.I did notice that when they were kittens, they fell off very fast. But once their age hit 8 months to a year, they stay on for 4-6 weeks. I love having so many colors to choose from: for Christmas, they had on red and green alternating colors. We got a lot of comments!I would really recommend these as an alternative to declawing, and my cats seem very happy. Though I should point out, when you first start using them it's a two-person job to hold the cat down and put the caps on. Now, though, they're completely fine with it and will just sit in my lap."
5,Best Ever!,"My cat tried to pull them off, and they are still on! They have been on for 3 weeks now.Carol"
5,what a wonderful invention!,These work like a charm! I will never have to worry about being clawed by my cat again
2,Cats do not like rubber on their claws,What I suspected is true. cats DO NOT LIKE RUBBER CLAWS ON THEIR FEET. they fall off on their own or they get eaten off by the cat. I will have to clip their nails more often
1,My Vet's office didn't like the red,Every 2 months I have the soft claws applied to my cat's claws at the vet's office. Mostly I get the clear because my cat chews off the colored ones on his front paws. Dr Hart's office called me today and said the red ones were a harder plastic and didn't fit as well and seemed smaller. They said this application would not last as long and not get the red ones again. Size medium is the size I always get. (I bought the red ones for the Christmas season). I haven't had troubles with the blue or clear ones.
1,Never received mine,I never did receive mine but I did get refunded for the entire purchase. I did however go and buy some from a local pet store and they did great for the first few days then as my cat rebelled they tended to fall off one at a time.
5,They work,"I was hessitant at first but was desperate to protect my furniture, I gave them a shot. They absolutely work. Just make sure to clip claws before applying them and make sure get the right size. I got large when I really should have gotten medium. They still works but I had to clip part of them to work. Now with the. Right size they are perfect. So far 5weeks and only a few have fallen off my 2 cats"
1,Require constant maintenance and don't prevent furniture damage.,"I'm very disappointed with this product. I am using Soft Claws on all three cats. I check all of their nails at least twice a day and replace the Soft Claws that have fallen off. But the cats are able to to claw and damage rugs and furniture while wearing Soft Claws. The long plastic claws actually seem to catch and snag some fabrics easier than clipped natural claws.Update: after a month of use, my cat's paw became swollen, inflamed and crusty around two of her claws. The vet said it was a reaction to the soft claws. I removed the soft claws and discarded the remaining product."
3,Compilation of Kamera Records tracks,"Collecting both sides of non-LP singles, and selected album tracks from ""Hex Enduction Hour"" and ""Room To Live,"" this album essentially is a compliment to ""Palace Of Swords Reversed,"" which gathered tracks from The Fall's time at Rough Trade Records. ""Hip Priests and Kamerads"" isn't as strong an album as that other compilation, but it does boast some pretty good tracks, such as both sides of the ""Lie Dream of a Casino Soul""/""Fantastic Life"" single, ""The Classical"" and ""Hip Priest."" It also is the only place one can find the studio versions of the ""Look, Know""/""I'm Into C.B.!"" single, as well as 5 live tracks of songs from ""Hex Enduction Hour,"" 4 of them not on the original release. These range from the great (""Just Step Sideways"") to the average (""Mere Pseud Mag. Editor"") to the awful (""And This Day,"" which is a bad song to begin with). I would not make this the first album to buy of the Fall, but once you have established your fanship, it will be necessary."
1,Don't waste your money,"These mitts did not last more than 6 months. It may seem like a novel idea to have oven mitts made of silicon, but the problem is that the seams ripped open, basically leaving gaping holes in the mitts. Before I realized there was a hole, I burned myself when taking a hot pan out of the oven. My traditional quilted oven mitts are much more beautiful, more effective, and last longer. Don't waste your money on these mitts!!"
4,You Won't Laugh This Hard Reading a Travel Guide,"Desi Downey's Ni Howdy is one of the funniest, down to earth, travel stories I've ever read. She tells true stories about real people and situations. Forward author, George Wang, hit the nail on the head when he describes Desi as another Lucille Ball. As a veteran who spent 18 months in Saigon and Nha Be during the Vietnam crisis, I can relate to the culture shock, brought on by shear naivete. If you're looking for a suspense-filled travel novel, Ni Howdy is not one. Ni Howdy is a very entertaining anthology of hilarious and romantic anecdotes and a really fun read. Go for it!"
5,Great Book!!,"While reading this entertaining story of the author's experiences in China, I couldn't help but think of my Chinese friends. I've told them about her adventures and they can't wait to read the book too! I look forward to more stories from this author!Eileen Burnham"
1,a big disappointment,"We are travelling to China and I was really interested to learn more about it. This book was a total waste of time and money. Several pages dealt of nothing but the ""squatty potty"" still in use in many other countries too; I even found one in an old hotel in France! The landscape, people, food could have been described so much better. I'm sure there were other shades of yellow involved as the ""urine yellow"" used all the time. In setting up a household, I expected a nice description a la "" Under the Tuscan Sun"" by Frances Mayes. But what infuriated me most, was the primitive language with a few f... words thrown in. I heard Mrs. Downey is writing an other book; maybe she can clean up her act for that one.If anyone wants to read a good books about China, but more business oriented, I recommend Mr. China or China.INC.Christa M. Jent"
2,"A Look, Perchance?",This book has received excellent reviews -- most recently in the newsmagazine The Week. But I won't buy a book where the seller won't let me see at least a small excerpt. I imagine a growing number of buyers are feeling this way. Want to increase sales? Provide excerpts.
4,Great Light Reading on Heavy Topics,"This book is a collection of short articles published previously, all for the generalist economist. McCloskey skewers mainstream economics for its insular habits, woeful statistical techniques, and inability to change. I found all of the essays provocative. The style is chatty and conversational, and as McCloskey has interacted with many of the world's leading economists and Nobel laureates, it makes a great read. Highly recommended."
4,Very helpful and informative,"It's written more for therapists than lay people, but the summaries of each reflex, how to test, symptoms of imbalance are very digestible and easy to follow."
3,Not as bad as expected,"Having read the previous one-star review, I expected to hear music that sounded like Alvin and the Chipmunks. Well, I was pleasantly disappointed. On my equipment, these CD's sounded fair to good. Since the price was only $5, I didn't take a great risk. The songs are good enough to go on my hard drive, and 8 or 9 will even make it to my iPod. I can imagine that some of the knockoffs of these CDs came out worse than the original source, but this was not the case with the ones I got. If you like Belafonte, you may take a risk on the 36 All-Time Greatest Hits, and you may actually enjoy them."
3,good indoors,"This dinner bell is not very large and as a result not very loud. It is not something that you want to use outdoors, but is fun to call guests to the table indoors."
2,Nice look but poor quality,"This triangle looks real nice and has a long and strong leather strap to hang the triangle and the striker from. Too bad the paint chipped off after using it twice. The first time left several impact cracks along the striker and the second use is when the paint started to fly off. And before you say it, no I was going going to town with the striking force or speed. Just normal easy going clanging. If this is for decorative use, go for it, if you actually want to use it regularly or even occassionally go for another brand and preferably not something painted but in cast iron."
2,Lodge Original Finish Chuckwagon Dinner Bell with Striker,"This dinner bell does its job and sounds good, but the paint on the triangle is chipping where struck by the striker"
5,Positive messages can help everyone,"This product can help anyone become more positive in thought and in action. Yes, it might take discipline to be positive, but then again it takes just as much effort to be negative. ""101 Power Thoughts"" can help one focus on abundance and know that we can have the life we choose.Patrick Leonardi"
3,not what I expected,"This woman's voice is hard to listen to...yes it is full of affirmations however this cd is not for everyone. I bought it based on the reviews and I wish there was one review to tell me not to buy it. I think the cd would be good background music as someone had said for relaxation, but to me her voice was hard to stay focused on. The author is an older woman, maybe this is why it didnt work out for me as I am in my late 20sI want to say I am not bashing the cd, clearly some people found it helpful, just not everyone..."
4,I was skeptical but...........WOW!,"I couldn't imagine what to expect from this CD. I popped it in the player and out came a soft friendly voice telling me what I deserve out of life. It was great to hear that I deserve goodness in life and deserve to be loved because Im me. I sure hadn't told myself that before. These and a ton of other affirmations seemed more valid to me since they were coming from an unbiased third party. This started to get my brain going on the right track. Hopefully soon I can regularly implement (think them, say them and believe them) these power thoughts during the day especially if negative mind chatter pops up. I do highly recommend this CD. Each time after listening to it I feel so uplifted, positive, peace of mind, and relaxed. Ive started putting it in while doing household chores and while in the car. Like another review states its very soothing and relaxing to listen to....that surprised me. Thanks Louise!"
5,Great mood lifter!,"I listen to this once a day. It's great to hear how wonderful I am, yes it's worth every penny."
4,"everyone that listens is surprised, inspired, and motivated","Have used as an 'affirmations' tool to help people develop positive, affirmations related to their current situation and coping. While some may find the content somewhat 'new age,' it has merit."
5,"Very Helpful, I listen to it often",I listen to this every day. It has positive words that I take to heart. When I feel I need some positive thoughts I just put this on and it helps.
5,Outstanding--You can listen over & over again!,"This is an outstanding audiobook. I highly recommend this audiobook, you will find yourself listening to it over & over again!"
1,Say it aint so,"I use a lot of Clubman products but this one has left my home never to return. Without a doubt the worst smelling aftershave ive ever gotten a whiff of. I love the Clubman regular and Bay Rum as well as their talc but this stuff is simply awful. They really need to rethink the formula on this Lilac stuff as it really does stink, literally."
2,The classic formula seems to have been changed,"I have used Lilac Vegetal for about 40 years since I was in college and say their ad in Playboy, so I'm not new to the rodeo.Anyhow, the latest product seems to be a new formula with mych less ""lilac"" and more of a ""paint thinner"" fragrance."
2,Lilac Vegetal,I've tried many aftershaves and found this one lacking. It has an aroma of cold medicine and flowers. The bottle was tossed after first use. This is a personal opinion of course and Clubman Pinaud makes many good products.
1,Terrible,"This is the most god awful stuff i have ever put on, My wife told me it smells like douche and i am just trying to be honest. I won't be buying this anymore either."
1,scent of urine,"This product enables the user to acquire the smell of urine. Should you desire to emanate such a rare fragrance, instead of urinating upon your clothing or even your skin, simply purchase and liberally apply this product. In addition to imparting such an unpleasant smell, this product has a long post-application life. Once I applied it after shaving, then took a shower and washed my face and the smell could still be detected. I then washed my face a second time with soap and went to bed; I could still smell the vegetal on my face in the morning.It is unfortunate that this awful product mars the otherwise excellent Pinaud line. I would highly recommend the ""clubman"" and ""bay rum"" products by the same company, both are excellent masculine aftershaves, without a hint of the scent of urine."
1,Rancid,"Don't buy this product because it has a rancid odor that you can't get rid of and you can't return the item because it is considered (Hazardous Waste)...""No pun intended"" UPDATE FOR RANCID--So as to not make it a total waste, instead of using it on yourself just use it as a toilet bowl cleaner, that is what I am using it for."
3,Not like it used to be,"All I can say is that when they switched to the latest version or the rounder bottle they changed the formula. I will use this version up and not repurchase this product. It's like everything else in this country. It's pretty said that when a reasonably priced, quality, old standard goes by the wayside."
1,Smells like Wet Ones..AWFUL..,"This stuff is awful..I have 8 Clubman bottles of different type,,,but this stuff smells like the wipes you get to wipe yourself...this is going down the drain. All my other Clubman stuff I love..this one no way..Maybe I got a bad one but I doubt it. Some thought it smelled like damp diapers..sorry Clubman..but this one stinks... I didn't know what Lilacs smell like....but I know know..I will never pick them.."
5,"Last long, smells great, protects your face.","I bought this bottle over a year ago and I still have not use half the bottle. Just a bit is going to leave your face feeling cool and fresh and will protect your face after a nice shave. Burns at first, but man up and you will get used to the feeling. Great choice, can't go wrong with this after shave."
1,Terrible,This fragrance reminds me of when I was a little kid in the 70's and I would go visit my grandmothers friends. There is nothing flattering about this odor in a bottle. I should have rusted the reviews that said that it smelled like a funeral home. Directly into the trash after putting a little bit on my hand to see what it smelled like.
1,Fake Pinaud After-Shave!,"It seemed a little off to me, but I was certain it was fake when I realized the word Cooling was spelled incorrectly on the bottle."
1,RIP OFF! We paid but never received product. RIP OFF!,We paid for this but NEVER recevied it. We were charged but the Pinaud Clubman Lilac Vegetal After Shave never came!!! Who do I speak to about getting a credit or getting the product finally delievered?Six months later product finally was received.
3,It's OK,"Have heard and read lots about the VEG. So I finally decided to purchase a bottle and see for myself. First, the scent out of the bottle is pleasing (despite what you have read). However, the scent is VERY strong when you splash it on. A little goes a long way. After it settles down, the scent is solid and smells like flowers."
3,"Not perfect, but a good effort....","Though this GBV ""side project"" doesn't match any of the GBV classics (Bee Thousand, Under The Bushes Under The Stars, Alien Lanes) it is as good as any other of Pollard's albums. Carcass & Crow and Nothing But The Quiet Now are the top tracks on this one. I would recommend this one to any GBV fan."
4,THANK YOU !,"Out of the fruit of this man came many others. I cannot say to much about something i can only glean from. But what i can say is ""THANK YOU"" !"
1,A terrible kindle version,"This review has nothing to do with Watchman Nee as a writer. He is one of my favourite. It has to do with the kindle publisher who published this 3 volume book spanning over hundreds of pages and neglect to put a table of contents in order to navigate it. If you order this kindle version, you won't be able to navigate this book except by using the search function or moving through it page by page."
5,A MUST for all Christians,"The is really the only book I suggest Christians read besides the Bible. Mr. Nee is clearly speaking from the Spirit in today's terms. It's a book for the growing Chrisitan, but I don't diefy it. I just have lived what he's preaching and I know that he is 100% accurate. Get it, read it over and over."
5,"Now, This is body of church age!","This is a wonderful and excellent book for us who have a pure heat to persue personal spiritual and life growth.Now, This is a body of church age! We not need body buildings but personal truely life. This is a good guide for not noly distinguishing fresh, soul, and spirit; but reality for life."
2,Hyper-spritual and unbalanced,"Though I usually love to read brother Nee's works, though they are Brethren-influenced and dispensational, I found that Spiritual Man was especially unbalanced and hyper-spiritual.It is based on the shaky premise that man is a tri-partite being, and builds a whole spiritual theology from that foundation. It is taken to such an extreme, that the translators had to invent the terms, ""soulical"" and ""soulish"" to help explain brother Nee's ideas.This book will most likely appeal to Charismatics, Christians interested in mysticism, and emotional people on a spiritual quest, but will not likely interest or help people seeking a plain Biblical theology. And even though some of the operations of the Holy Spirit in the believers life are well explained by brother Nee, I feel that his ""insights"" would do more harm than good to those Christians who are unfamiliar with the precious Word of G-d."
1,Fallacious Appeals to Emotion,I found this book to be riddled with gross numbers of logical fallacies that were unsupported by any degree of physical evidence. For anyone with a proper education this book is nothing but insulting to ones intellect.
5,A MUST READ FOR EVERY CHRISTIAN,"I am surprised that this book has not been publicized as much as these other christian books we have out here that only meets the surface. Watchman Nee's book ""Spiritual Man"" reveals the real problems with man, and the solutions that Jesus Christ has to offer which is based solely on the cross and the resurrection. I praise God for using Watchman Nee to reveal such profound truths like no other Christian author I have read. I have read many books from Christian pastors and authors seen on TBN, Daystar, INSP, and other christian networks. This book exceeds all. It is as if the Holy Spirit was writing the book while Watchman Nee was just pinning what the Holy Spirit said. Please, if you do not have this book, you must get it. It will open your eyes to Jesus, spiritual warfare, faith, healing, and etc. like no other. He uses scripture upon scripture and the guidance of the Holy Spirit to validate everything that is said. GOD BLESS WATCHMAN NEE"
5,The Spiritual Man by Watchman Nee,"This is not an easy reader. I had many thought provoking ideas that made sense to me. For example Dr. Nee thinks that man (woman) (this is an old book)is made up of three parts; body, soul and spirit. We are a trinity, not the same as God, but in His image. This is a book you will pick up and lay down. You don't zoom through it. I bought the E book version and I'm glad. I also have it in paperback. It is a weighty book made up of volumes so can't tell the number of pages very easily. If you are interested in enriching your Christian inner as well as outer life, please get it."
5,The Spiritual Man,A very powerful book! Next to the Bible its self this is the most meaningful book I have read over the course of my 60 years as a Christian. It has opened my eyes to help me understand many difficult theological questions.Gary Fuller
5,Been Looking for Something Like this Forever,"Finally found an affordable little fireplace for my small apartment. Looks great, made of high quality materials and gives off a nice amount of heat, the flames look very real. Thanks Dimples for a great affordable product."
5,Double love it,"I ordered 2 for my guest rooms. I believe they arrived in 2 days! They are assembled, just remove the box. The fire is pretty realistic, and I like the way you can have just the fire setting or heat added to it. The remote is small and works great. My husband and I like the house temp. colder at night, than most of our guest do. So now for pennies, they can have their room toasty. Worth the money!!!"
4,Finally a fireplace,"The flame is unbelievable. Others that bought like products, said the flame was better than theirs. I did have a problem with the product and called Dimplex to report the heater problem. They are sending a new motor. The first couple times I used it the heat raised the room temp 5 degrees but after that it would hardly put any heat out."
2,Not enough heat!,"The heat this unit puts out is minimal. I can only feel heat if i sit in front of it. If I am 3 feet away. It feels cold again. The flame looks good from a distance, but fake from up close. Not what I expected for the price."
3,nice looking flames,Love the look of the flames. Our room may be too big to get as much heat as I would like.
4,Cute little space heater,"Although it arrived with a dent in it, it sure is a cute little thing. It might have gotten a functional review if it was winter time, but since we just got through a week long 90+ degree heat spell in New Hampshire, it will be kind of tough to do that. But it sure is cute. And little. Fits any where. Sure hope it puts out heat next winter."
4,Appears to work quite well; NOT Dimplex or U.S.-made,"Though I haven't had a chance to use it on a consistent basis (not cold enough yet), the Electric Stove seems to work well. I don't know about the power and $$$$ consumption yet, again since I have not used it on a regular basis yet, but I will do a follow-up review at that time. Flame looks real and it heats up nicely. The remote is quite handy as well. I personally like it (so far...)."
2,My smaller duraflame heats better,"First of all, I got an Electralog from Amazon and not the Dimplex. Supposedly this has 5500 BTUs but you would never know it because it throws off less than my smaller Duraflame heater which is only 4600 BTUs. Does look nice and the flame looks realistic,( but so does the duraflame heater). However, I wanted more heat for a larger room and thought a greater BTU stove would provide that."
5,"Great, attractive heater!","The stove arrived today, just in time for an expected cold front! I really love it! The stove is attractive, the ""fire"" realistic, and it throws out more heat than I expected! I can feel the heat blowing four feet away. It takes the chill out of a room in no time. Plus, it's very portable and I can easily move it from the dining room where I have it into my bedroom at night.I highly recommend this lovely stove!"
1,came broken twice,"Inside the stove, there is a glass heat shield. The first time the stove was delivered, there was a million shards of glass inside of the box. It looked like someone had thrown the stove onto the ground. Amazon's return policy is so easy, that I was not upset. It was picked up from my doorstep two days later, and was replaced with a new one in its place. But the new one had the same problem, with also one of the walls falling off. The box, and the styrofoam was broken, from the shipping. Now the box, and the stove is sitting on my porch. The ups man would not pick up the package because the box was so damaged. I don't know what Amazon is going to do. But with two deliveries, I am going to give up on getting my stove through Amazon."
5,Really great,"I use this heater in my finished basement and as you are walking down the steps you can feel the heat generated by this unit. The flame is pretty realistic for a fake fireplace. Overall, between the heat output and the quality of the build I would give this 5 stars. Definately a good purchase for an electric fireplace."
4,It's Nice,Its a nice little stove. Puts out pretty good heat and the flames really are realistic. Its a nice addition to any room.
3,Cozy for a small room.,"The stove out of the box worked flawless but I was disappointed for the amount of heat and the force of the fan. I bought to set in front of the fireplace in a drafty trailer but quickly found out that it couldn't compete with South Dakota in a trailer. Instead of sending it back it now has a nice home in a small guest room in the trailer. It effectively heats a room of about 200 sq ft but don't ask it to do much more when the temps frequently hit zilch below. It is very well constructed, quite attractive, and the fire effect is somewhat realistic, but a little dim. I replaced the 25W bulbs w/some 40's and the brightened up the glow a little. Overall it is a cool little product, but if you can afford a little more I'd go for the next couple BTU's up. Despite my review, my dog Buster gives it 5 stars!"
5,Very happy!,"Got a great deal and a great heater! This thing has been working 24/7 for the last couple weeks. Temps were down as low as 8 degrees here, but I stayed warm. The thermostat seems to work well, so set it and forget it. It's quiet, puts out lots of heat and the flames look good. Good quality. It's also a cat magnet. As far as they know, it's a real fireplace!"
5,A great buy and an even better heater.,"I've owned the Dimplex CS3311 Compact Electric Stove for 3 months and love it. I have tried other electric heaters but have found this one to be far superior. It was delivered quickly and was ready to use right out of the box. It's surprisingly light and looks amazingly real - the ""flames"" look very convincing. Admittedly I have a very small house, but I was able to turn off my gas furnace completely and heat the first floor with this heater alone. I recommend this product highly."
4,Great little stove,I use this stove in my living room while watching TV. It keeps the family comfortable during the cold nights.Glad I purchased it.
5,Wow. So easy. A lot of heat too.,"Lift it out of the carton and plug it in. Take the remote out of the box, open the battery compartment, and pull out the plastic tab.Look at the back of the stove. Set the tabs for remote control and heat. Wheel adjusts heat. I forgot to push the tab to heat, so I only got the flame effect at first. 5 minutes total installation.Placed in front of my fireplace, on the brick ledge. Flame looks real. A stunner. I can't believe how real it looks. Very strong heat. No wonder the reviews are so good. At this price, if I have to replace it yearly, I'll be happy.I was using ventless gas logs. They do foul the air. The gas logs also cost $ 20 per month for the pilot light, whether I used it or not. Sure the gas logs put out more heat, but who needs that? It overheats one room, and the others are colder. This provides the supplemental heat I need on raw days."
4,Got What was Promised,"Works great, Totally realistic flame, cool to the touch everywhere, pushes heat from the bottom in a way that it does make carpet warm.Excellent for the price and shopping around saved about 80 bucks"
4,Like my Stove!,"Easy to set up, works really well. My kids LOVE it on cold mornings! Doesn't put out a lot of heat, but its enough to make a warm spot to sit after being out in the cold."
1,Not worth it.....,Item died after not even two years. Was kept clean and free of any dust (very important for these little stoves) and was always maintained by the appropriate power source. Not pleased.
2,Not durable,"I have two problems with this heater.1. Durability: I have had this heater for 2 years. It worked great the first winter we got it. After bringing it up from storage to use the next year it didn't work. The fan was no longer working, causing the unit to get hot and turn itself off. We called Dimplex/electrolag and they replaced a part as it was still under warranty. It sounded like a very common problem as they did not even ask for receipt of purchase or even wait for us to really explain the problem. This replacement part worked this winter. Now we are into year 2 and our 3rd winter. After bringing the unit up from storage it has the same problem, just as before. I bought this brand because I thought it was durable and this unit would last me a long time. Clearly it doesn't2. The heat blows from the bottom. However much of the heat gets trapped into warming the carpet and floor underneath the unit. I think the unit would be more effective if the heat was blown from the top."
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this heater last year. It worked well for 1 winter (that's approximately 3 months of use) but gave out after a few days of use this winter. For the price I paid, I was hoping to use it for a much longer period than that. It looks really nice and the log flames were pretty but another brands (similiar model) looked more realistic. Another negative about this product is that the control panel are in the back and very limited in fuctionality. I have seen similiar brands with control panel in the front (with more options and functionality), hidden inside the door. I would not recommend this product."
5,dimplex CS3311 Compact Electric Stove,I am very impressed with this little stove that I use in my RV. It is just so perfect and lifelike.Also the shipping was amazing. I rec'd it in less than 4 days and did not pay extra for shipping.Great job.
2,Doesn't compair with older models,Expected dimplex quality and was disappointed. The product now has the name Electralog on it. Nowhere will you find Dimplex's name. Not sure if Electralog makes these for Dimplex. And they are made in China.The one shipped to me had some cosmetic flaws. But worst is I am afraid to use it because it gets very hot and makes my laminate flooring too hot to step on. I'm keeping my old one to use as a heater and am only using the electric fireplace and not the heater on this one.If you must have an electric stove buy the $100 model.
3,Nice but not a super heater.,"This is a nice looking heater. Even the flame is somewhat realistic. However, the blower only has 1 speed. The blower is quiet so that is a plus. The remote only turns the unit on & off, it does not adjust the thermostat. This would be a better heater if the blower speed could be adjusted higher."
5,electric stove-heater,This is one of my favorite things I've purchased on-line. It is very cool.Looks really cute-adds a homey look to my living room and puts out a good bit of heat. Arrived on time and in perfect condition and has worked fine.what else can I say- good deal for the money!!
4,Great additional heating source,"This little woodstove is great. I bought it to supplement my oil heat and it really does a good job of keeping my living room & dining room warm during the day so that my heater doesn't run constantly. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it is supposed to be a DIMPLEX CS3311 electric stove and the name written on it is ELECTROLUX. Dimplex is nowhere to be found on the product. But it does work well, and I would recommend for other people to buy it."
2,Dimplex Stove CS3311,"This is my second stove; I gave my first one to my daughter. Unfortunately, I was disapointed as the stove does not give out as much heat as my first one (a Dimplex) even tho this new one cost more. I'd hestitate to purchase something of this nature on-line again."
4,As Expected,"It looks exactly like the photo and operates as expected. In a basement with no interior walls (unfinished/uninsulated) it will create a hot pocket about 10x10 after a few hours of use in the middle of winter in an unheated basement. With a normal/insulated room I think it would preform quite well. It doesn't give off as much heat as a toaster oven style heater, but I feel much better having this around the kids and don't feel I have to worry about thomas the tank engine ending up in a molten puddle of goo. I hate fake electric fireplaces, but this one is actually pretty cute."
4,Does the job,Excellent electric fireplace. Easy to use and easy to move around. Our Family room is nice and toasty with this unit.Would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a nice space heater and do not want to spend the big bucks for a real one. This one will impress you.
5,Cool cats,I used this set to teach both of my daughters to read. The text is simple and repetitive to build confidence in beginning readers. Highly recommend!
2,Cool Cats,"These are ok for early reading. They have a book that is hands on, but for variety, would be a good purchase. Scholastic has better early readers and Pup and Pop are great too."
2,Unattractive graphics,"I bought this set together with 2 other Phonics Boxed set for my 3-year-old girl. It turns out that this set is not touched at all, since it's only black and white printing. And the illustration is too simple and the characters are not popular, unlike the other characters that are seen on TV. So it's not been really useful at all!"
1,For children maybe.........,If you are buying for children I would recommend it but it is ENTIRELY to small for adults. I won't order this type of product again without finding out the size.
3,Not as Family Friendly as You Would Expect,"Once again, I bought these DVDs based soley on positive reviews at Amazon. Yes, the plus side of this show is that there is no sex or violence, but that doesn't necessarily make it family friendly. There is LOTS of shooting and stabbing so beware if you have small children. The first two episodes of Season Two are about love and romance and my teenaged boys totally lost interest. While nobody in my family liked this show, I watched it alone and the characters eventually ""grew on me"". ONE HUGE WARNING: Do not read the back of the DVD case before watching. It leaves NO SURPRISES and ruined the first few shows I watched because I knew everything essential that was going to happen. After I hid the cover behind some books I watched the rest of the season in blissful ignorance."
1,A disappointment...,I purchased this book as a soft cover on Lulu website and I didn't pay more than 25 dollars.The author talks so much about how great he is that I purchased some books from him to see what I was missing.And that turned out to be nothing.99.9% of the sorcery recipes in this book are the same as the recipes from the famous Herman Slater's book 'The Magickal Formulary'... how sad...I expected more. At least I expected new information and not a summary from someone that read many books on witchcraft during the years and decides to summarize them in his own books.I don't recommend this book.
2,Expensive!!!,"This manual is comprehensive, but you pay the price. If you're looking to get into the mystery shopping business, start as a mystery shopper first quickly, then decide if you want to do this."
2,Depressing,"If Israel were peopled only by the types in this book, it wouldn't have survived at all - suicides, victims of murder and madness, young men dying in war. There was nothing positive in the book. None of the people he writes about had true character, breadth of vision or hope. That the author's style of writing was good didn't help."
2,comfy but weak,"I was glad to have finally found the right pair of boots, but it didn't last long. Not even 3 weeks after I bought it, it already has deteriorated. Given that I live in Seattle, rain seeped in really easily and the sole pads started breaking. It was like wearing melted cardboard."
1,Hard To Read!,"I cannot believe how difficult this book is to read and comprehend! The author uses such complex words and phrases, it just bores me to even read the first paragraph. I can honestly say I hate this book."
4,Long sleeve polos,"A good value for the money, color was a little different than pictured on the screen"
2,Like it when it doesn't fade,"I bought several of these kind of shirts but for some reason, this color, even after 1 wash in cold water, and low dried in the dryer, it always fade near the collar. I bought a second one and the same thing happened.I would not buy this color again. The other color seems to stay put although one of the lighter green shirt is now experience the color fade as this one."
5,"Lou Reed sobers up, gets serious, sort of....","In January 1980 work started on this album, Lou's final album for the Arista label. The band, according to Mr. Reed, was thoroughly rehearsed and knew exactly what to play. They flew to Montserrat to record and they laid down what to many was Lou's best album in nearly a decade. After the album was recorded Lou started to clean up his life, started dating the soon to be Mrs. Lou Reed (one Sylvia Morales) and began eating right and (gasp!) doing physical sports like playing basketball & snorkelling!!! He quit cigs & booze. Hope & change.Musically, Growing Up In Public was a sobering thought when I first heard it in 1980. The band is tight, and a little ""jazzy""."
5,Reed's Most Underrated Album!,"Growing Up In Public doesn't get the credit it deserves. True, it is not Reed's best, but it still a great album. Not all of Reed's albums have the level of consistancy that this album has. How Do You Speak To An Angel, My Old Man, and The Power of Positive Drinking standout. Growing Up In Public is an incredible song, which would rank among Reed's best. Also, It is really cool to here Lou going into Take Me To The River in Teach The Gifted Children, which is another great song. This album should be essential to Any of Reed's fans. Buy It."
1,Not worth it,"Lou Reed's career has as many low points as high ones. This is one of the lowest. Bland, anonymous studio musician rock with lyrics that are so over-the-top that they become unintentionally funny. Eventually, though, even the humor factor wears off and it quickly becomes unlistenable.The scam, at the time this came out, was that this was REALLY Lou Reed - no, REALLY, the REAL Lou Reed, talking about his REAL life. Really! Honest! Of course anyone who believed that would also want to invest in Lou's shares in the Brooklyn Bridge or his offering of great real estate in South Florida.The best thing about this album is the cover. Nothing else on here is worth bothering with. Most of Lou's output on Arista records showed him at his least interesting, and this one unfortunately is one of the worst (only surpassed by the truly abysmal ""The Bells,"" which no one should be forced to listen to).God bless Lou Reed, but give this one a pass."
4,Literate but mainstream rock,"This is a very literate Lou Reed album, and not one of the critics' favourites. The music tends towards mainstream radio rock, yet it contains great songs like the title track, Love Is Here To Stay and the very catchy Power Of Positive Drinking. My other favourites include How Do You Speak To An Angel, My Old Man and Teach The Gifted Children with its poetic lyrics. The subject matter deals with relationships and the album has more of a warm, human feel than the classic works Reed is best appreciated for. By any other standard than Reed's own, this is a good rock album that has stood the test of time very well.Lou Reed: Growing Up in PublicNew York"
3,PANTS DOWN!,"This is a below average Reed album, but I still enjoy the title track [""growing up in public/with your pants down""], Love Is Here To Stay and the very catchy Power Of Positive Drinking. How Do You Speak To An Angel and My Old Man are not bad either."
4,Spirit GT-Pro Deluxe ROCKS!,"For a guitar that is half the size of any regular style guitar, it sure does pack a lot of sound. The neck pickup is deeper than my Strat and the bridge pickup is not as bright as my Strat. Basically it is a sound between my Strat and the LPs that I have heard. The middle pickup is very low though when used by itself. It takes a little getting use to being so small because there is no guitar to rest your right arm on when strumming. Remarkable, it stays in tune better than my Strat. Overall it is very nice and I like it."
1,All 5 star reviews? Give me a break...,"I had to read this horrible book for an NCODP. Someone please give me those hours back. At best, he has maybe 40-60 pages of worthy material in here. It is padded all to hell and written in a ""See Spot Run"" style that is amazingly insulting. Even worse, none of these ""leadership"" stories involve combat. They are all about APFTs and barracks inspections. Snore."
1,Not worth it,"This books seems like a haphazard reconstruction of the many leadership powerpoint briefs we in the military receive. A quarter of the way through the book I just began skimming it when I would sit on the toilet. Not to denigrate a man's service, as I am an active duty Marine, but there are numerous great leadership manuals and books put out there by people who have served in combat, thus giving a better example of leadership and responsibility under many different circumnstance. As a combat veter myself, I tend to lean more towards combat veteran authors, as they can provide in-depth discussions on leadership and the meaning behind responsibilities."
5,Love this!!!,This is a great vinyl decal! It's not too big but still great to let everyone know you're a cowboys fan!
5,decal,"Nice quality and priced right. Looks very nice, and is as advertised. It came very quickly, and will make a nice addition to the collection."
1,item not received,Actually I never received my item and I found no way to complain to your services. Please give me back my money or send me my book.Thank you
5,good choice for anthropology students,"This is a very good, readable book. It depicts a culture in which helping others was the normal--not the charitable--thing to do. The mindset of the Teduray people of the Philippine rainforest, with whom the author Stuart Schlegel lived for years, is a world view that, sadly, seems almost unbelievable for people who are indoctrinated into a capitalistic system. It's like a splash of cold water in the face. Wouldn't it be nice for every Anthropology 101 student in the U.S. to experience this book, if for no other reason at all simply to face the fact that there are human mindsets possible that are not ruled by money, greed, scarcity, and conspicuous consumption?"
1,Misleading,Half alcohol - half extract. It would have been nice if the seller had stated the ingredients in the web information.
3,The Losing Battle with Islam,"David Selbourne's ""The Losing Battle With Islam"" is the quintessential guide to understanding the past and present Islamic movement. Selbourne traces in excrutiating detail the history of violence and the Islamic rebirth. I find nothing particularly objectionable in the discourse and believe he makes a good case for Western misunderstanding of the Muslim sense of moral superiority and belief in the eventual triumph. I only have a bachelors degree and found Mr. Selbourne's Oxford style of writing difficult to get through and it took me a long time to read. That may just be me, but I did find the book very informative. He does not, however, offer any solution for the ""losing battle."" Good not Great!"
5,97 -99 Ford Expedition Mirror LH,Perfect fit works great and easy to install my husband put the left mirror on while I put the right mirror on it was a snap. Love them
3,Beware of Bright Lights,"I own two of them. The sharpness, detail, and light sensitivity is excellent. However, there is a significant issue with this camera: the Color CCD sensor can be permanently damaged by exposure to bright light sources, like the sun. The result is a faded, yellow splotch or streak in your images which never goes away. Repeated exposure to bright light will cause the entire image to have a yellowish cast and loss of detail. If you use this camera for viewing an outside scene, make sure you don't catch the sun inside the frame. As the sun moves through its ecliptic, it will steadily burn out more and more of the CCD until the burned section covers a good portion of your image and the camera becomes a doorstop. Both my Watchport cameras are damaged and almost unusable. I wish I had looked at one of the Axis cameras before I bought the Watchport. I've used the cheap Logitech cameras, Philips cameras, D-Link cameras, the Axis cameras, and none of them have had this issue."
2,I stopped at p100...,I really wanted to like it since I loved Blake's Louisiana Dawn. But in the book Luke the plot was boring (he saves the helpless girl) and the chemistry was not intense enough for me. He loves her from page 1 (like a puppy/too sappy for me) and drops everything to follow her to a conference (when supposedly she despises him and she does not want his help). I guess it was too unrealistic for me.
5,luke,"Love these books. My sister started me reading them. I read all of them in about two weeks. After I read them, she started reading them again. It had been years since she read them."
5,Amazing historical insight!,"Quick reading style. Very informative. I thought the insight brought from this book was exceptional. The fact that history could repeat itself is a bit frightening but things happening in today's world make it seem more plausible. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand true historical fact, firsthand."
4,Great nostalgia toy,Mulan and the characters are favorites in our household! Happy with the product but Khan does not stand up. The product description did not mention that can only be in that position.
3,Good but sometimes incomplete,"This was one of the first magic books I read. I put it down, read a few more, watched a few videos and then picked it up again. It made more sense with a little bit of background information. The tricks are rated as to difficulty, but the rating scale is a little inconsistent. Some of the harder tricks I find to be easy and vice versa. I like the diversity of the book and think it is a great addition to anybody's library."
2,"Not a bad book, but not good either.","While the book itself covers many different illusions that are quite common to the avid magician, the book fails to provide very good descriptions of how to perform the illusion. Honestly, spend the extra cash and buy both the royal road to card magic and bobos coin magic book to actually get a better start."
3,Satisfactory but confusing,"The book ranks the tricks from 1 star (easiest) to 3 stars (hardest). On some of the 3 star tricks, the synopsis that precedes the step-by-step explanation is quite clear, but ALL of the steps in ANY given trick have numerous abbreviations that become annoying. For example, instead of saying ""with your left pinky"" it will say ""with L4"". I understand why they did it, but it becomes monotonous quickly, and doesn't do it any justice for clarification."
3,Not for anyone with significant ability,"This book looks very helpful for those just starting to learn sleights, and appears to cover the major areas (coins, cards, balls, and cigarettes). However, it's directions are slightly confusing and its illustrations are not as clear as they could have or should have been. It's also lacking in teaching presentation and performance. It is not completely bad, however it is also not the first book that I would recommend to people wishing to become sleight of hand artists. If you were purchasing several books on sleight of hand this would be appropriate to include, but otherwise stick to the Dover series on magic (Modern Coin Magic by JB Bobo, The Encyclopedia of Card Tricks and Advanced Card Manipulations by Huegard, The Art of Magic by JB Bobo, and generally any book published by Dover Publishing Inc)."
2,"Good, but there are better.","I recently purchased this book thinking that I would be getting some new tips in sleight of hand, which I did, but with much aggrevation. If you are a beginner I would not recommend this book. It's books like this that will make people turn away from magic. The concepts are good in this book, but the drawings are difficult to match with the instructions. The drawings and the explanations can cause a great deal of frustration and make one want to pass on tricks all together. Most of the stuff in this book is covered in Mark Wilson's book (which has 10 times better pics and explainations), so if you want just a few more tricks then get it, but altogether I wish that I hadn't bought it.The only real good thing about this book is that it has some good cigarette vanishes and a good routine, but it may take you 10 hours o decipher what you are actually looking at. For beginners...not really...if you are a beginner...go to Mark Wilson. Cheers"
2,It's ok but not good,"I bought this book hoping on good lessons in sleight of hand, the concept was good, but the drawings were so close together you really couldn't tell what they were doing and they were sketches which made it harder, i myself was not too impresed."
5,fantastic,"I'd really rate this as 4.5 stars if they'd give me the option. The very last song, the name of which eludes me, is quite forgettable, but everything else on this album is incredible. I especially love the vocals, and the driving guitars... Sometimes the lyrics are a little funky or clumsy, but forgiveable. You can tell this is their first album -- not that the quality isn't there, it just doesn't sound over-produced like a lot of albums. To me, as I look back at the alternative rock scene from the late 80's to mid 90's, this album pretty much sums up everything I wanted to get out of that genre."
4,Tamborine,This is a new tamborine and it came in the desired time. It makes a pretty good sound. A good tamborine for the price. Thank YOU
5,Tambourine,"This tambourine has great sound, is easy to hang on to, and adds a lot to our quartet that I have sung in for nine years."
3,great product,"usb memory is great, and 128MB is a nice size, but this price is too high. if you can't find this anywhere else, buy it here. I got mine from dell not ibm, but it's only 64MB."
2,Quiet Down,"I got into Main post 2000's and while I greatly have come to embrace these works, motion pool just does not do it for me. Sure its got the subtle drones of most of their other works but I cannot get past the cheesey synth/guitar aspect of this album. I love the first two tracks but it goes downhill from there. I think Main is best served in quiet form with sensory babble and white noise as done on the firmament series later down the road."
4,A Great Companion to her Possibly Best Album out of 4,"I find Beyonce to be more than type of video star that Michael Jackson and Madonna tried to be. Really. Her videos are effective and awfully simple at times. Standouts include ""Irreplaceable"", ""Flaws and All"", the ""Kitty Kat"" video leaves you wanting more, ""Upgrade U, ""Freakum Dress"", ""Deja Vu"", ""Ring the Alarm"" and ""Get Me Bodied""......practically the entire set."
4,Beyonce video DVD,The package arrived within the time frame that was given and was in good condition.
5,~Beyonce' Rocks!~,"I have to say that I love Beyonce' B'Day Anthology Video Album!!!...She put a lot of work into making these videos in such a short time...And, I for one am very pleased that she put this out...I watch the DVD everyday while I do my treadmill workout....All the songs in the beginning are fast paced...With the exception of Flaws and All...Then at the end the last two songs are slow....Just in time for my cool down...Watching the videos makes my workout go by so much faster...I love it!!!.If you're a fan of Beyonce' I think you'll enjoy having this in your collection of DVD's:)"
2,not tough enough,The softpaws fell off almost immediately. At the end of the advertised month that they are supposed to last only two are remaining intact. The edges get stuck in the carpeting which I would imagine is also somewhat painful or dangerous for my kitty.. I think I will just stick to clipping her nails every month!!
4,They work for saving furniture but you have to keep reapplying,You have to keep reapplying the covers but if you don't want to declaw it is a good option. My cat scratches my furniture but my family is opposed to declawing. You have to be careful not to overfill the covers so this seems to be the best option for saving my furniture. My cat is cooperative when I apply them. I clip her nails first and then apply the covers. If you add too much glue it sticks to her fur and bothers her. Just a little glue will do. They fall off so I have to keep reapplying them as they grow longer and fall off. I replace the onces that are missing so about every week or more I have to replace one or more covers.
2,Soft Claws for cats,"My cat is already declawed but her back paws still destroy leather couches and wooden tables. The vet clinic denied to declaw her back paws so I had to buy those soft claws. It would work if she would not bite it all... It takes two people to apply those soft claws and the process is easy. If you have a quiet cat that does not bite it, it might work for you. Unfortunately it did not work for my cat. I still insist on putting the soft paws on her, but she bites it, and it's gone. I find them all over the house. Waste of money for me."
4,Saved her life!,"My husband and I just purchased a brand new home and had fun furnishing it with furniture. Unfortunately, my cat enjoyed our new furniture too...as a stratching post! If it wasn't for soft paws, she would have either been sent to a new family or Taken to the pound! They are pretty easy to use. Yes, they fall of periodically so you have to monitor their paws and replace them as u go but its soo worth it!! Our furniture is safe, new house is safe and my cat is still part of the family!"
3,It's okay.,"Our cat is a crazy feisty wild beast. We imagine that she thinks she is a tiger or something, anyway with these she tends to bite the tips off. But they are great in preventing her from ruing furniture and other things."
3,"Great at first, but came off.","To test these nails out, I tried only the front paws. The glue is really strong, but somehow my cat took them off. After a while, I would find one on the floor, then two, then three, ect. It became annoying. She only has one still on right now. I will try again but so far it isn't working."
3,Just oK. Not as good as the original Soft Paws.,"I've used both products and I prefer the Soft Paw brand. I'm not sure if it's the fit or the glue but they just seem to stay on longer and with less of a chance of ripping the entire claw off.But with either product your life will change. No more stressing over furniture or carpet being shredded while you are away or sleeping.No more declawing kitties, just cap the nails and be done!"
5,Really Works!,"I was a bit skeptical about these, but my 9 year old cat was starting to destroy some of our antique furniture, so we didn't have much choice. I asked my vet about them before I bought them, and I was assured that they are not cruel or harmful to the cat. They are wonderful!! I figured our cat, since shes a little older, would hate them and chew at them constantly, but shes not in the least bothered by them, I had no problem putting them on, and they don't come off as some other people said they would. I put them on once, 2 fell off within a day or so(I think I didn't have enough glue on them) and the rest have stayed on for over a month. And the little pink toenails are just adorable! All in all, a great product!"
4,I don't remember ordering this...,"I got this package in the mail, and it had this in it. Well, I WAS thinking about it...but I really don't remember ordering it. I'm thinking my cat was clawing at my foot while I was sleeping, and I grabbed my phone and ordered this while still asleep! Well, it's sitting on the table waiting to be put on. But a friend of mine told me a vet needs to do it because the cat will move around too much, and/or bite them off before the glue can dry. So if I actually do this, I'm going to have to take her to the vet. This is the reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars."
5,LOVE SOFT PAWS,"I have an indoor cat that is not friendly. She was an outdoor wild cat that we brought home. I thought it would be impossible to get these on her, but it was not. I wraped her up in a blanket and gave her to my 7 year old son to hold. I pulled out one paw and put the plastic tips on her. It took under 10 minutes to get these on her. She didn't mind at all. I held her for five minutes in the blanket after we applied them. She has not tried to get them off. She licked them, but that was it. It has been over a week and they are all still on. She has not scratched up my furniture at all with these on. They are wonderful. I was going to have to get her declawed if this didn't work, but will not be doing that now. So far, so good. I think they are a great product."
5,Awesome!,"I am so happy we are using Soft Claws! My husband is strongly against getting our cat de-clawed, but our cat has been scratching our carpet and even scratched the baby one time. I searched and found this product and am so happy we did! We ordered the pink ones to be able to see when they fall off so they can be replaced. I had to hold our cat with a towel so my husband could glue the caps onto the cat's claws, but it wasn't as horrible as I thought it was going to be and she only tried to take them off for about 15-30 minutes and then just left them alone. She has had them on for abot 3 weeks and hasn't had any issues!"
5,Highly recommend,"Great customer service and great product. My cat has been wearing his soft claws for a week now and they are still securely on and look great. He hardly notices them and my furniture hasn't been scratched at all. My cat still goes through the scratching motions, but no damage is done. He can still use his nails to pick things up and grip things he climbs on."
5,Best invention ever!,"I heard about this product but wasn't sure if my cat would let me put them on but it worked! Just like trimming her nails, she gave me a minor battle but once these were on and dried, she was totally fine! She hasn't even bothered to scratch the furniture and my only regret is that I didn't get them sooner! I definitely will be getting more in different colors. They're so pretty and met my expectations and then some! Oh, BTW, the seller sent me the product in a lightening speed so I'm definitly going back to him/her."
2,use with caution,"While putting them on can be a challenge, I was very pleased with the initial results. However, my cats like to knead soft things and I found both of them stuck to items like pillows, blankets, curtains and stuffed animals. They struggled frantically to get them off, I'm sure twisting and pulling at their claws painfully. It happened repeatedly so the urge to knead is greater than any 'learning' from the bad experience.They may be OK for a cat that has been de-clawed in the front but not the back --to solve the issue with leather furniture launch damage."
2,"Ok, but they don't last.","We bought a couple varieties of these to protect our leather couches. They do the trick very well while they stay on, but eventually they always come off and you have to buy more. I found that simply trimming our cats claws with toenail clippers was much easier and more effective."
3,"Excellent concept, but difficult in execution","I thought these were a great idea to keep my cat from scratching - but it's far too much of a battle to get them on her. If you have two people (one to hold the cat in a towel, and the other to glue these on), then go for it! They work great once they're actually on!I found that providing a scratcher that my cat loves has solved the problem of her scratching other things. It took years to find one. (My cat loves the ""S"" shaped one that you can find at many pet stores and on Amazon.)"
3,Fell off,"We applied these to my cat and they fell off one-by-one after the first week. They did look cute on her while they were on, though."
3,It all depends on the cat you have.,"My cat (one I got it for) has a very bad habit of using the carpet for a scratch pad. Mind you, this 5.9lb little cat has sucessfully pulled up (or loosened) the installed carpet in my house. Upon reading the reviews, I tried it out. First few days...success!Then... I got a feeling this isn't right for this cat. Despite my persistence, she still clawed the carpet with it on. (goes through the motions) Then I noticed these things break off, with the nail INSIDE. Mind you I followed the directions, cleaned her nails, clipped prior to putting this on. Then, I thought of removing them and realized I didn't have any acetone (because I'm allergic to it) so now I have to go get nail polish remover to take it off.Cat has returned to her old habit and also is deathly afraid of me clipping her nails now. Bad bad bad for my cat! Maybe good for you, not for me!"
4,a useful item,"For anybody who is wondering whether these work, our experience is positive. Our cat is not especially docile, but she seems to have no problem with these. She cooperates with having them put on, and she doesn't try to bite them off, as we had feared. This is a good, practical solution to an aggravating problem.One significant limitation we've seen is with the number of nozzles provided for the adhesive. Because the soft claws typically come off one at a time, you end up going through the nozzles before you've gone through the claws or adhesive."
5,Awesome documentary series,"An amazing, nostalgic series on the history of the auto and all the culture developed around it. From cars of the 50's, drive-ins, diners, VW, Jeep, etc... it is a very entertaining video collection. I would highly recommend the series or any part of it."
5,3V Caps,Vet recommended this product not only for dog skin and coat but also stated that combined with Cosequin is very effective for pet arthritis. Price and fast shipping along with pet safety is why I ordered this product.
5,Great product!,"I had adopted 2 cattle dogs with a questionable diet. Their skin had hot spots and areas that were bald and they were shedding an excessive quantity of fur. I spoke to the vet and he wanted to put them on a stonger, perscription version. But due to the cost I knew it wouldn't be possible to keep them on it. So I did some research and that's when I discovered 3V Caps. Work great, just put them in with the mixture of food I give them and the pills are always gone. No digestive problems. We now have great skin and fur, clear eyes and even the edges of Bruno's ears are normal again. Amazon offers the best price and I will continue to purchase through them. Thx again."
5,Beautiful Shirts,I bought these shirts for my son-in-law for Christmas and he was thrilled with them and wears them all the time. They are wonderfully made and look so sharp.
1,Save your money,"WORST BOOK ON GOLF, OR ANYTHING ELSE, IVE EVER RECEIVED. TOTALLY WRITEN IN CAPS LIKE THIS, WITH NOTHING NEW IN IT. No pictures, drawings, etc.. Hard to believe this was acually published in the first place. Returned this piece of junk at first opprotunity. If you get the impression I hated it, your right. Get the 21st century golf book instead to learn how to throw the club head."
5,This book is wonderful!,"This book is a golfer's bible! It explains the world of golf in simple, easy to understand terms. There is no way you won't improve your game."
3,You're rolling the dice with this one,"I've installed two Kohler Forte faucets recently, that were purchased by my customers. One was fine, the other had a bad valve that necessitated a return trip to the store. In fact, 3 of the last 4 faucets I've put in had some kind of defect. Seems they're all made in China these days by a small handful of parent companies, and the quality control (or lack thereof) becomes evident the more of these you install."
2,Gorgeous but Leaky,"Third replacement for the Kohler Forte. It leaks between the bottom of the faucet and the base, so no amount of plumber's putty works. Customer service claims it's O rings. It is not. They have been replaced. I won't buy Kohler again due to issues with my Forte, which ironically means ""strong"" in German."
4,beautiful faucet,"my plummer just installed this faucet recently, and had no problems with the connections or with it leaking. I just luv the style and beauty of my new faucet."
1,horrible faucet,"this faucet leaked on arrival, and was not desinged well, leaked between the bottom ring and the middle portion."
1,Beautiful but unreliable,"Despite other reviews that complained about annual leakage issues - which I deemed easy to fix - I went ahead and tried this faucet out. Well, more fool me for trying to save money.This morning, we woke up to a flooded kitchen because the hose that connects the cold water supply to the faucet popped a leak in the night. More to my surprise, the hose is embedded pretty deeply into the faucet housing and only a complete dismantling of the entire faucet assembly would allow me to access it and change the hose. What a ridiculous design. Now its not a matter of going to the store for a new hose so that we can have water again, but instead either waiting for Kohler to send me a replacement, or going to buy a completely new faucet.Based on my experience, and the reviews of others, I would not buy Kohler again."
5,wonderfully sturdy silicone spatula,not flimsy/bendy like some silicone spatulas -- works great on heavy and sticky batters and doughs.
2,Chip away...,"Loved the color of this spatula, and had high hopes when I received it... BUT alas- the love affair came to an abrupt halt when I noticed it the silicone was chipping on the sides- yikes! I don't want that in my food~ so this ended up in the trash."
4,"2 movies, 1 great price & package","I've been interested in getting PI for a long time. It was a pleasant surprise to get both PI and Requiem for a Dream, together, for such a great price. I've only had a chance of watching the PI DVD and it's a very good quality with a few fun extra's. The main advantage of this product is two great movies, one nice package, at one great price. If these movies or this director's work interests you, then it's a hard bargain to beat."
3,Nice,The movie quality was great and so was the packaging but it seemed like a recording of some sort. They're weren't any movie previews
5,buy these,"if you don't mind depressing and weird movies I highly recommend this 2-pack. REQUIEM will turn your smile upside down, but if you can handle a dose sadness where addiction is concerned, it is a great movie. Just keep it away from the kiddies, as the brutality of the sex scenes is highly inappropriate.PI is just an out there movie about a crazy mathmatician that has one of the best and most unique stories I have ever seen. Like some people said, it is in b&w;, but if you like artsy movies that are deeper than anything you will see at the multiplex, definintely buy this."
1,good to doog ot,the only thing worster than a film about mathmatics is a film by an illiterate people never begin to wonder who has written or not if they have. who. ???
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this,combo for the price, I got interested in Pi because it's supposed to be the predecessor of the Butterfly Effect, wich I really enjoyed, the one thing you must keep in mind if you decide to buy this movies is the released dates of both movies and not only their subject. They do give you something to think about. But don't set your expectations too high..You could be dissapointed!!!!!!Just like me."
3,Just Artisan releases packaged together,"Here's the thing. These are both great movies. I want to give it 5 stars on that. But I can't, because a) it's just a combo pack of the two Artisan releases, and b) it's deceptive about the aspect ratio of Pi.Since this is the existing discs, Pi is not anamorphic widescreen. The Requiem disc is excellent, and it's the uncut version with all of the nifty bonus material (including the easter egg for Tappy Tibbons Rule #3). But the fact that they just stuck the old Pi disc in there is bad.Point is: if you don't have either of these movies, this is a great bargain (mostly, I've seen it retail for $9.99). However, if you have either, wait for them to finally release Pi anamorphic because this ain't it."
1,This book sucks,"First of all, the CD did not have all of the Practice Files I need to actually USE the book. Second, the features it runs through are so basic as to be useless to anyone who has ever used Word, Excel, etc. There's nothing on how to creat mail merges in Word, for example. This was a complete waste of $20. Only buy this crummy book if you know absolutely NOTHING about Word, Excel, etc."
2,I am puzzled and dismayed,I have not received this item and it leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth at the outcome.
5,Our favorite in this house!,"Not since Barney has my 18 month old liked a video so much! She actually asks for it by saying ""Babies"". There are no adults, just toddlers doing what they do on a daily basis with very little narration. Going down slides, playing in toddler pools, playing with toys, etc. My daughter sees them doing the same things she does and gets so excited she shrieks out loud. I really think any child will love this one."
3,Interesting story. Beautifully filmed.,"OK, this wasn't the best film. However, the story was intriguing and many of the outdoor scenes really capture the beauty of the Iberian landscape. The metaphor is amazingly well played out: Spain and Portugal are separated from the rest of Europe, go off together across the ocean, and become a stepping stone between Europe and the Americas. It's an interesting reflection on the Iberian nations' history of discovery and exploration, their unique relationship with both the rest of Europe and the ""New World"", and their complicated yet close relationship with each other.An added bonus to this film is that it's great practice if you (like me) are a language nerd interested in learning both Spanish AND Portuguese."
5,A great little heater !,"I have had this heater for over a year, and it performs great.I even use it in the summer for the flame light because it's so realistic and economical. Not many heaters are actually pretty. But this one is. It has two speeds for heat and you can just use the flame light with no heat. I am very pleased with it."
2,worked well while it lasted.,"Had this heater (Dimplex) for two seasons. Just plugged it in for this season (fall of 2006) and the heater got bright red, started smoking and burned up. The fake flame is all it's good for now. If you have one, be careful, it's a fire waiting to happen."
3,A couple of disappointments,"I do like this bass, but there were a couple of disappointing things about it. The description says that it comes set up with a high C string, yet what I received was strung with a low B set. I had to spend another $22 to get the strings I wanted on this thing. It also had some serious fret buzz issues indicating that not much expertise went into the set up. I can correct for all this, but you'd think on a new instrument it could have shipped with at least some semblance of having been properly adjusted."
2,Not as I expected,"This book was rated ""very good"" when I opened the package the book broke into two pieces. The pages are so yellow that the they are beginning to turn brown. I understand that this this book is from 1975 and that my total cost was just over $4. I would like to have been made aware of this info in order to make an informed decision and not be unpleasantly surprised."
3,Interesting not passionate,"The life of a political leader is always interesting. And Golda Meir lived through very troubled times - and during very important moments of Israel's history, before and after the foundation of the country - and had the opportunity to participate in some of the more momentous political decisions of her time. Even so, the narration is never thrilling or profound, important details are very often lacking and the personal exposure is reduced to a minimum. If you are interested in the history of Israel this is mandatory reading. If you are not, skip it."
4,golda was great,"To hear her story in her own words is realy incredible. the book grants the reader access to her private memories which are written in a way that you hear her vioce and think her thoughts. Unfortunatly, her thoughts were a little long winded."
1,Horrible,I hate it so many times it is bad and no good and bad grammar and run on sentences and too many words and too long.
4,My Life - Golda Meir,"Received book in time frame stated and in condition described. This is an older book and I found it a bit difficult to get into because there are so many details about her life - famous people she dealt with and her political views on a variety of issues, that I got lost in the details. I found myself skipping around in the book because I really wasn't interested in the minutae of her life. She is a remarkable woman and her life held purpose. She accomplished much and Israel is much better because of her influence. I'm sure others would find the details vital and interesting."
5,One of the best books on the subject,"Kate Distin's ""Selfish Meme"" is one of the best books on memetics that I've read. Distin reviews the relevant literature (including Dawkins, Dennet, Blackmore, Aunger, Sperber, Boyd and Richerson), analyzes the differences among the authors and critiques the ambiguities and conflicts of definition (for example, the conflation of replication and imitation in Blackmore's ""The Meme Machine""). Distin uses the metaphor of memes as carriers of cultural DNA and considers the implications for cultural evolution posed by the selfish meme. I consider this book essential reading for anyone interested in memetics."
3,Large book; lots of photos!,This book would be good for a coffee table collection. I read through some of the stories but only a few I found truly interesting. I like all the great photos :)
5,FINALLY A BOOK ABOUT WOMEN,"It was so good because I learnt a lot about women lifes and so on. Sorry for my reasons, but its so hard to explain. Thank you."
3,A Mixed Bag,"I wasn't entirely sure what to expect of this one, but I was pleasantly surprised. Some of the stories didn't work for me, especially those heavy on religious imagery or subject matter, but others I really liked, especially those dealing with ordinary people placed in incredible, unreal situations. Although most of the stories were very particular to the author's homeland, I never felt alienated by this.Overall, a good read, full of dark, incredible and uplifting places."
4,"Dark, Grotesque, and Nicely Executed","A postmodern orgy of lust, sacrilege, and murder: this is the world painted by a talented young writer Mike McCormack. I liked this book, because the human element is never lost, despite the nearly ubiquitous and sometimes graphic description of atrocities or grotesque situations. This is McCormack's first book, and it reads like an auspicious start. In brutal detail, McCormack gives us his account of the tortures of the young soul."
3,Does what it is supposed to do,Product does what it should. It just has way too much perfume for my taste. I've stopped using it because of that.
3,Not one of her best,"I usually like books by this author, but I didn't really like the hero in this one. Tanner is to arrogant, jealous and possessive of Angelena when he railroads her into marrying him. Even though he changes and they end up happy together, it doesn't make up for his bad behavior in the beginning, IMO. The rest of the story is relatively good, although somewhat predictable. Readable and over all enjoyable, but not her best."
4,childhood memories,I ordered this tape for my kindergarten class because I loved it as a child. They really enjoy watching it and are quoting the movie. My only gripe is its a different vhs than what I had growing up. The big apple city part is the same but the additional cartoons at the end is totally different than what I grew up watching. All in all I absolutely loved watching it with the kids and I even remembered the dialog verbatum. Its a must have for those with children.
4,If you want some good memories . . .,Then watch this movie! I remember watching this movie and the other SSC movies from when I was 3 or 4! I loved this movie and the Popples videos. I Hope you enjoy!
5,Traditional Country Music/Gospel Fan,This is truly a fantastic video of traditional gospel music. The interviews with the recording artists is wonderful and takes you back to some great memories. This is music that should be preserved. A must for any country music fan. Have bought several and will continue to buy.
1,Don't work as a ice cream carrier,This product does not do its function as cooler. I put an ice cream at 7am and at 9am every thing was melted. Don't recommend it at all
3,Trashy and Fun,"A decadent and disposable Lou Reed album for sure, but most of the material is pretty good, some great. I give this a very strong three stars as opposed to a weak three stars for ""Rock and Roll Heart"".This is not Reed's best set of lyrics (he readily admits he was hardly trying here), but the music is quite accessible and mostly fun. Nice use of horns for a bit of a soul and funk feel to some of the tracks. Highlights include ""Billy"", ""Kill Your Sons"", ""Ride Sally Ride"" and the title track. Just don't pay too much attention to most of the lyrics (something you wouldn't usually say about a Lou Reed record)."
4,Good.,"A worst legal story. Compared to Michell McDeere in the Firm and Mike in the Street Lawyer, this is Grisham's worst novel"
1,This book BITES -- and I used to like Grisham a lot!,"Save your money and buy Chrichton's book 'Timeline'! This book had a pointless plot that glamorized criminals, and an even worse collection of sub-plots. Grisham has gotten lazy in his old age, and he takes more from the front page of the newspaper than from his own imagination. This book doesn't even deserve a star."
3,Not your typical Grisham book by any means!,"I guess John Grisham is trying to branch out into non-lawyer fiction and this is his first real effort (though the Testament was close). While I enjoyed the story and read it in about 2 days, it sure didn't feel like a JG novel. As other reviewers have written, none of the characters were appealing and none really believable. Take JG's name off this book and it would have been released straight to paperback under some no-name authors name. It's still an enjoyable read, just imagine someone else wrote it and you'll like it. ...Dave"
1,Deeply Disappointing,"SHAME SHAME SHAME on the publishers of this book for not sending the manuscript straight back to John Grisham so he could finish it - just too greedy - they couldn't wait to flog it as is.John Grisham should use a pen-name if he intends to keep writing PAP like this - it's a betrayal to the loyal fans who expect better quality.If you are a fan of John Grisham, don't waste your money buying this book, borrow it from the library and be prepared to be disappointed."
1,Boring brethren,"If you want to lose time,you should read it.This book is horrible borig and primitive.The heroes are very artificial.The story is too long and has no main idea.The best thing you should do with te book is to throw it away before reading."
4,Many sleepless nights.,I was never much of a reader until I picked up my first John Grisham novel. His books seem to be written in a way that keeps your attention throughout. In every chapter there are three or four different slory lines. Mr. Grisham will build your suspense and then immediately switch to another story line thus making it very difficult to put down. I believe that by switching directions as much as he does it allows the reader to feel that the book is not dragging on. Mr. Grisham has made it very difficult for me to pick up a book that doesn't have his name on the cover.
4,An entertaining read,"""The Brethren"" is a very good and engrossing novel! He even made politics interesting to me, which is no small feat!The Brethren are a group of judges in a minimal security federal prison. They are extorting money from rich gay men who want to remain anonymous.One of their victims turns out to be someone very important and well-known and this is when it becomes impossible to put the book down.""The Brethren"" is a fast-paced novel. Though it has many characters Grisham doesn't allow you to get lost. There are many different stories that he ties up nicely in the last few chapters.A great story - superb writing - I strongly recommend it."
3,Plot Holes,"I enjoyed reading this book, but I couldn't get past the huge plot holes. I won't give any away, but if you read the book you'll know what I mean. The story is also somewhat predictable, no big surprises."
3,Ho-Hum,"This work continues Grisham's departure from his true art--the courtroom thriller. Being a native of North Florida, I enjoyed the setting, especially all of the references to Jacksonville Beach landmarks--it gave it a ""real"" feel. However, the story line streched it perhaps a bit too far. This is probably one that you would want to check out from your public library instead of buying yourself."
3,not grisham's best!,sorry grisham fans this was not his best but still good. I had a hard time with the middle of the story.
2,Different But Good,"This was the 4th book that I have read by John Grisham. The book before this I read was The Testament, which I though was excellent, although The Brethren I felt was not his best work. Sorry to say but I felt that the plot was lacking substance and carisma. Though this book was very different in nature I was confused on the rise of Arron Lake and the brief characters such as Buster and the Argrow brothers."
3,Know what you're buying,"Those reviewers that are trashing this book need to step back and ask themselves why they buy a John Grisham book. You should have already figured out from his previous works, especially his more recent ones, that you will not get compelling action or memorable characters. What you do get is a readable, entertaining story. The Bretheren delivers that. Face it, Grisham's recent books are not heavy reading. Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed the ending. Does every ending have to have a surprising plot twist, a ferocious action sequence, or an ""aw shucks"" love union? Given the morality of the characters involved in the story, I find the ending ironic (although I won't say why for the sake of those who haven't read the book yet)."
4,Another Great Grisham Novel,"John Grisham' s newest novel revolves around the legal word, just as his previous novels did. But, in this novel, he has two separate plots going at once, adding new twits and turns, making the reader wonder how the two will connect. One of them takes place in a minimum security prison in Florida, where three ex-judges are serving sentences. The three judges have started a scam, to hook unsuspecting victoms, and it is working. Outside the prison walls, Grisham is writing about a completely diferent world. A governor from Arizona is running for president, with help from one of the most powerful men in the country. I really enjoyed this novel, because of the suspense leading up to the end of the novel. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys John Grisham, this is one of his best books yet."
3,Please let there be a sequel!,I enjoyed the book much more than The Street Lawyer but was disappointed by the ending. I just pray John Grisham is planning a sequel to let us continue with these characters!
3,Also disappointed in the ending,"I'd have to agree with the reviewers who said that he seemed to ""mail in"" the ending. Maybe he was rushing to try to get it out during the election.Also, what about the poor men who got embezzelled? Is there no justice for them? I'm sure a lot of gays would be disappointed in their portrayal in this book. It's almost like saying ""you're gay and this is what you get for it.""Still, I found it somewhat engaging, just don't think it's his best work by a long shot."
2,Character Development,"Not one of his best. I wish he would take more time with his characters, like Turow or Martel."
3,Great until the end.,"Good story with interesting characters. Carries you along with fast paced action. The ending was typical Grisham, predictable. So you know that you movie ending will be better."
1,Don't Waste Your Time On This Book!,"This is the worst book I have read in years. Not worth the paper it is written on. John Grisham should be embarrassed to have his name on this book if he actually wrote it, which I doubt. How an author who wrote such a terrific book as The Firm could have written this stupid book is beyond me. I kept reading on the mistaken thinking that it just had to get better. It didn't. Save your money and more inportantly, your time."
2,Not bad,"This book was not as good as other books Grishman has written, but it wasn't a bad read. The ending, though, needed some work."
1,Grisham is losing his touch,"I was so disappointed in ""The Brethren."" The book was slowly paced and I did not find it interesting at all. Most Grisham books grabbed me right away, but not this one. I didn't care about any of the characters. The plot was predictable and monotonous. I hope his next book is better, because he can only go up from here"
1,Get a Closer from the Bull Pen,"I love legal thrillers and suspenseful tales, but Grisham needs a relief pitcher for the late innings. The ending was so weak, I wondered if he had fallen asleep writing it, like I did reading it. In contrast, I recently read two books by an author in the same genre. He's lesser known, but the guy writes a fantastic finish. If you're a Grisham fan, as I was through his earlier books, try Frederick Schofield's ""A Run to Hell"" or ""The Boardwalkers."" Mr. Grisham, maybe you should, too."
3,Alas; the reviews are true...,"John Grisham is by far my favorite author; but this last effort left me cold. Never once did I feel the main characters were in any danger; which is one of the feelings a suspense novel should create in a reader. The story was different but dull. I am hoping that Grisham will return to writing that makes one want to reccommend or lend the book to others. Two of my Grisham novels are lost because I lent them out. Three of them are ragged because I've read them each three times. But I will always know where ""The Brethren"" is; and it will always look brand new. I think Mr. Grisham must have cranked this one out in four days or less."
1,Not worth the paper or the ink . . .,"Not only is this book the poorest example of John Grisham's work, it is among the worst books I have ever forced myself to finish. Pass on this one and hope Grisham goes back to caring about his work."
1,I am just disappointed!,After reading several Grisham's books I just can say this is probably is worst book. It is still a Grisham but not at his BEST.
2,Big bang that fizzled into nothing...,"The plot was fairly predictable after the first two chapters. The ending had no credibility, and I bet even the screenplay becomes more sardonic. I decided to read the entire book before buying it and it was the right decision. The person who wrote this book is not the same person who wrote The Firm. That book had attention to detail and character development that is just nonexistent in The Brethren. I guess commercial success leads one to write fluff in exchange for the next advance check!"
3,interesting plot but no likable characters to care about,"It was initially hard to get interested in the book because none of the characters were admirable or likable. There was no character for whom to care. After a few chapters, I was drawn on just because I wanted to see what happened. The story is basically a sad one. As such, I feel it a brave one for Grisham to write. The world is full of such sad stories with no real resolution."
2,Grisham is definitely losing his touch,"I am one of the biggest John Grisham fan you will ever meet because I have an autographed John Grisham book of A Time to Kill and The Firm which I both bought at local auction at $225 each. I have been waiting for The Brethren since the day Amazon announced the new book. I went to my nearest bookstore in my county and bought The Brethren. When I went home, I immediately started reading it from 6:50 to 11:00. Let me tell you this. Borrow this book at your local library. This book is dull, the plot was exetremely weak compared to The Firm and The Pelican Brief, the ending was just too predictable and is hardly even interesting. This book makes The Partner and The Street Lawyer seem like the greatest book ever written. so trust me, borrow this book at the library because it is not worth the $+tax."
3,"An exciting treatment of Sacerdotal Evil, I think","The only problem I have with a book like this is that things never become clear before they become horrible. Just when you come to understand a character's morality, the characters shed their earthly sacerdotal robes and begin their ascent to eternal life. At the same time, things keep happening that make you challenge your assumptions even before you make them. A perfect example of this is the scene in the celesstial latrine. Here Grisham is at his most perverse. Nevertheless, he manages to retrieve his reason from time to time. Flummex me not."
2,Where are the last 100 pages?,"I love Grisham and always buy his books the day they come out. Like his other books this is a quick and sometimes enjoyable read. However, I was waiting for some great twist at the end that never came. The book just kind of ended. Also there were no endearing characters and in the end all the ""weak"" characters won out. Disappointing at best."
1,the bretheren,"A real disapointment, after his other offerings I was sure this would be a ""cannot put down"" Alas it started shallow and remained that way. Maybey the movie boy`s can re-write and add some depth?"
1,disappointed,"This was a very disappointing book. I expect more out of John Grisham. The main plot got lost in the jumble of subplots which made reading the book a chore. Mr. Grisham, please revisit some of your earlier works, like A Time To Kill, and the Pelican Brief. The Brethen has lost the gripping suspense of your earlier work."
3,"NOT HIS BEST, BUT A GOOD READ!","""The Brethren"" is not John Grisham's best book, not by far. That being said it is still a good, quick easy read. From time to time Grisham can produce a book of real merit and insight & soul like he did with ""Testament."" Other times he just churns out another bestseller. ""The Brethren"" is one of those books. And another problem with this book is how predictable it is. You can guess the plot twist that will occur on page 128 while reading the second chapter! But even with it's fault the book is worth a read. And let's all hope that next time the author puts a little more effort into his work!"
3,"Pretty good, a normal Grisham book","As a reviewer said, Grisham has never claimed to be a great writer--Who is? His sales are of course helped by movies being made of his first few books--As many bestselling author's sales are (You know, the old saw, ""If a movie was made of it, it had to be a great book""--which is actually the farthest from the truth). So critics need to back off a little. If you do want to read a Mississippi born writer who is still turning out good tales despite also having the ""movie-made-of-book-hype"" to not have to write good to sell his books, try Thomas Harris (Though Hannibal wasn't quite up to his norm). Or try Charles Wilson. He's never had a movie made of one of his books, and yet I would rank him the best Mississippi writer of the bunch--His latest, Game Plan, is certainly a top notch read--one of the best I've read in a long, long time."
1,"Grisham has ""missed the boat"" with this book!","The reviews online tell it all. ""The Brethren"" was a disappointment to myself, and the majority of Grisham fans. It started out as a ""page-turner,"" if for no other reason, than to see just how The Brethren (three unsavory judges serving time in a prison), the CIA, and a presidential candidate, were all going to fuse together. The potential was there, but it fell apart very quickly, and was a disappoint to the end. I am glad my book was borrowed, and not purchased. It would be like buying tickets to a Barbra Streisand concert, and seeing Willie Nelson instead."
1,Do not bother reading this book,"I stopped reading Grisham after his poor showing with The Rainmaker, but started again because the last few were good. Now I am stopping again for good. This book was horrid and boring. I only finished it because I hoped something interesting would eventually happen (like the ending in The Partner). But it never did. There were no plot twists and nothing of interest ever happened. All of the characters were flat (and once again, all were male). This was not a good book."
1,Total Garbage,"I've never considered Grisham a writer. I've read a few of his books merely because they are a quick read and I find out what the movie will be about. Usually, the books are not awful, the action and suspense sometimes catch my interest. The Brethren however made me want to vomit. The book was probably the worst piece of writing I have ever read. The story was equally terrible. I can not believe it was published."
3,"By far not his best book, many gaps...","I have read all of Grisham's books and this one was different them all of them. It's not as law related as the others with no big firms or major law conflict involved. Grisham left many holes in the story though and even introduced one character during one of the chapters and never mentioned him again. The political side is interesting though in light of the campaign going on right now. The book wasn't bad, but not great. Not worth the full price, and even the 50% Amazon price is questionable (that's what I paid). Definately worth borrowing and reading. Entertaining but problematic."
1,"Better than network television, still not Hollywood material","Perhaps John can squeeze a cable feature out of this sad piece of work... perhaps not.Right after I had finished it I felt so let down. I truly expected more from a story with so much promise. The ending was terrible. Grisham must be REALLY out of touch to think THAT would make us happy.Preferred ending: something along the lines of the conclusion to the movie ""Suicide Kings"".I wish it had been longer to,(would have had to be to fit in a decent ending anyway) I started it on a Wednesday and finished on Thursday instead of Friday.oh well...Later, John"
3,not one of his best,"Here's another guilty pleasure from John Grisham. Three judges in prison, known as, you guessed it, ""the Brethren,"" have come up with a seemingly perfect extortion scheme, and they're the most likeable characters in the book. What's wrong with this picture? At some level, I guess I admired their resourcefulness. The book is all about money and power, and the character development is nil. The Brethren's biggest vulnerability is their alcoholic attorney who shuffles their correspondence. Will he betray them and make off with their loot? Who's going to win out---the Brethren or their high-profile victim whose ethics are really no better than theirs, and he lacks their charisma. And, best of all, was Grisham prescient in foreseeing events that occurred after his book came out in 2000?"
1,mind-numbingly dull,"i was highly dissapointed by this book. All of the characters are paper-thin stereotpyes and none of them are likeable. The plot goes way beyond far-fetched. The biggest flaw is that the story just keeps making one unnecessary concession after another to the three ex-judges, for no credible reason whatsoever, except maybe to satisfy the readers' inclination to back the underdogs."
2,Not a typical Grisham book,"I preordered this book in anticpation of a good Grisham fiction thriller,I was grossly disappointed . Theauthor rambled on with characters poorly described for instance Teddy the man in a lot of unexplained pain covered in a wheel chair, why they wanted arron Lake as president then there was the character mentionedjust once and no more who started to tail Trevor and never mentioned again and the ultimate death of Trevor, it would have better if Trevor met the Three Judges on some remote island but to have him killed was poor writing, I think John Grisham must have read some of David Baldaggi books that author uses the fbi and CIA a lot no I prefer for Mr. Grisham to use his usual lawyer characters from Mississippi my favorite was the partner suspense and the most unusual final ending in any of his books once again in the Brethren to many undescribed characters should have been more descriptive, how about Wes and Chap to just come in a take over very poor"
5,Could not put it down,"I picked up the book last night and thought I would just read the first few pages to see what the book was about. I found that I could not put it down. I read the book in one sitting as I just had to know more with each page. Do yourself a favor and put this in your ""cart""."
2,In Search of More Poetic Prose in a Thriller.,"I am an author and I love thrillers. My biggest disappointment in today's world of adventure fiction is the inability to find a mesmerizing adventure constructed with poetic and living prose which allows me to feel the southern Louisiana heat, smell the toasted bagels in a Manhattan deli or wince along with the facial expressions of a lawyer caught ambulance chasing in the hospital room of a critically injured patient. While a better yarner than Turow, Grisham's works lack the sort of living color which fiction demands."
4,John Grisham meets Tom Clancy!,"I just finished reading this book..and all I could say that this is Grisham's finest work yet! The plot turns I will admit does take some getting used to beacuse he is intermingling many plot lines(I counted five). He is introdcing new characters just when you get totally involved with one and it could get annoying. But overall, the whole book suspenseful in the tradition of Tom Clancy(eek)and John Le Carre or Robert Ludlum. I think he may have crossed over some territory well established by these authors, he is the new kid on the block and may not be welcome by all. Good Luck Grisham!"
4,He's Done it Again...another best seller!,"Grisham created another group of memorable caracters. I always invision what hollywood actors will play what roll and in what city will they do the filming. I always wish they would try to set the plot traveling through Alaska on the state ferries, on which I am a Chief Purser ( that's right...the job that ""Goffer"" had on the TV show ""Love Boat"" we refer to ours as the ""Lust Boat"""
4,I liked the irreverence!,"For sheer disdain for the rules, this is the best Grisham since ""The Runaway Jury."" It's good to see a best selling author lighten up now and again.I think it's creepy that the CIA might be able to raise enough money to elect their own candidate, but the story of the three ex-judges running their own scam behind federal prison bars was enough to keep me reading.I enjoyed the book and am glad Grisham writes this way from time to time.I kept trying to cast the movie as I read...it will be interesting.Enjoy!"
3,Read it in an airport,Not a bad read but not worth the hardback purchase price! I would suggest that this is the perfect book to read in an airport or on an airplane. It may become less interesting with time though I must wonder if one of the main characters is modeled after John McCain. I fear that Grisham is just cranking out the books. Where is the hero?
2,More Filler Than Thriller,"John Grisham's assembly line continues with The Bretheren. The plot, although over the top, is interesting. There is not one character you care for. All range from obnoxious to horrendous. Grisham still finds it difficult to end the book. The only tension during the last fifty pages is continuing to check the last page number, do the math and say, ""God! Will this ever end?""The problem is filler. We repeatedly watch the first attorney get drunk or the judges walk around the track or the judges confering or the judges betting or . . . If you just pull scenes that were repeated three or more times, The Bretheren is a novelette.Jojn Grisham has more potential than this. Maybe some time off will help or perhaps a collection of short stories might yield great filler-less plots."
1,The Brethren,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. The story line had loads of potential, but it read like the author became bored and quit trying. There was so much potential for character development and also plot development. This is not a slam aganist Grisham, I've read all his books and have enjoyed most, but everyone makes mistakes. Let's keep our hopes up that the next one is not a waste of time."
2,Whatever Happened To The Author Of A Time To Kill?,"The Brethren is a perfect example of a book that becomes a megaseller just because of its author's mega reputation. While it moves along quickly (Thank God! ), The Brethren is weak in just about every quality you want in a thriller -- plot, characterizations, suspense, surprises, credibility, etc. This book is one more recent example of Grisham's spewing out books without caring enough about the quality on which he built his reputation. Since he's become a dynasty in the publishing world, he seems to have forgotten about the need to satisfy his readers. While it won't amount to a ""spit in the ocean"" to Grisham, his future fortunes are going to have to be made without any more contributions from me. This is likely to be my last John Grisham book."
1,Boring!,I was determined to reach the end of the book. Sheer determination won out over character and plot development. Never has a Grisham novel produced so many one-dimensional characters. The pre-publication hype was much more interesting!
1,Is John Getting Hungry?,"Like , Tom Clancy, I wonder if John is going hungry so that he has to publish novels that do not meet earlier standards. I eagerly awaited the book, having been a Grisham fan, but was very disappointed when I finished reading it. I thought the plot was weak, the ending easily figured out, and overall not up to the usual Grisham standards. I hope John gets his next book back on track."
4,Another enjoyable story by Mr. Grisham,"I have read just about all of John Grisham's novels and again he has not disappointed me with this story. In the Brethren Mr. Grisham took me on a journey into a political campaign, and how the government can control an election. The characters of the three judges' and their activities were believable. What I appreciated about John Grisham is that each new book that he releases takes me into a new world and I always learn something from his stories. The Brethren is a super story. Enjoy it, it's a wonderful book."
2,Where's the rest of it?,"Johnny, you're a clever story teller but there's a problem with the ending here-it doesn't have one. Nothing ties together, nothing invites me to keep on playing back the storyline long after I've finished it. For the first time ever, you missed the boat. Where was your editor on this one?"
3,It Wasn't THAT Bad (as the other reviews),"I read Grisham for entertainment, and entertained I was. It had its flaws, but it was a page-turner. I would have liked Lake to have been wearing more of a white hat. His was a shallow character, and I really couldn't care less what happened to him. Trevor was much more interesting, and I was very dissatified with his ending. Still, there was probably less ""Law"" in this book than his others. I usually learn something from Grisham's books, be it about wills, the gas chamber, jury selection. But I was entertained."
2,So close,"Uuuggghh! It was going so well but then Grisham decided he wanted to go off on vacation or something and chose to just add, ""The End"".What a disappointing ending!"
1,I should have known,"This was my 3rd Grisham book and without a doubt, my last. More paper thin characters, fast-food delivery and implausible activity. Nobody in the novel is likeable; nobody is believable. I'm not kidding when I say I read this book only when I wanted to fall asleep. How does this guy keep selling books?"
1,Heavy Sigh!,"This is the first time it ever took me more than a day...two at most to read a Grisham book. What the heck? Did he have a deadline to meet? I pre-ordered the book and checked my account daily when the release date arrived, ran down to my company mail room and clock-watched until quitting time. From the first chapter, I was not impressed. One month and two ""in-between"" books later, I finally made it through. I'm so bummed! Next time, I'll wait for the paperback or borrow it! Heavy sadness!"
1,Not worth it at all - save your time and money,"I am a big Grisham fan, but this book was a tremendous dissappointment, it seems that the idea of the scam (which I think was based on a true story) was the only believable aspect of the book. It is well written (as his novel usually are) but weak in main plot and characters. Bad ending. It seems that the pressure of writting another bestseller pushed the author too far this time. I understand that his next novel will not have a single lawyer in it, and, although it sad to see Grisham part ways with the subject he has been so strong at, I hope it is better than this dissappointing book."
1,Booooooring,"I've read and enjoyed Grisham's other books but this one was a bore. Shallow and unlikely were the two thoughts that kept cropping up. Sure , I read it through to its unsatisfying end. I just hope he takes a bit more time to write the next story than he seems to have spent banging out this one."
1,Grisham gets lazy,"I generally find it hard to put down a John Grisham book, but with The Brethren I had to force myself to pick it up.None of the charactors have any redeeming qualities. There is no one to root for, no one to care about, no one to like, no one to even pity. I just didn't give a hoot about what happened to anyone.The ending was unclimatic, but I was thrilled that it finally arrived."
1,Major Flaw in Plot,"I love Grisham's books, usually, but this one I just couldn't get into and really enjoy it. It has a weak plot to begin with but then the plot is continued by several huge ""coincidences"" and a major flaw. The major flaw is that Lake is exposed to the Brethren by a letter that includes another letter to a campaign supporter. What Grisham forgot though is that the CIA was checking ALL the mail going into the prison and that letter would have NEVER got to the Brethren. This huge flaw and the weak plot make this book something to pass up. Not the usual Grisham masterpiece."
4,Grisham's No.1 fan!,"The Brethern was wonderful.I have read all of the authors books.This one kept me spellbound. Grisham stepped out of his regular mold,I am glad he did.The characters(already in jail) were a likable old bunch even if they were the bad guys. The storyline about the presidential candidate was timely in this election year. I'm ready for his next book."
3,"Fair, but not up to The Partner or Runaway Jury","This newest Grisham novel was not bad, but was not great either. The outline for the book was very good. It just seemed that John got tired towards the end of the book and just ended it quickly, with little thought about the ending. If this were a movie, I'd say skip it in the theater and rent it later."
2,Lame,"The book started of great, but the end was just way tooeasy. He should've added another 100 pages and written another ending."
2,That's how it ends?,A TV movie. An awful ending. A quick read which required little effort and much too predictable.
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"John Grisham books are hit or miss, this book being one of the misses. The weak plot centers around a mail scheme targeted at closeted gay men. The characters are terrible and the pacing slow...This is not the Grisham thriller his fans have come to expect."
2,Short and not so sweet,"When I read ""A Time to Kill"", Grisham immediately became one of my favorite authors. ""The Firm"" was well done and fulfilling, as were one or two of his other early works.So after I read ""The Testament"" and this novel, I had to ask myself, ""What happened? "" It really seems like Mr. Grisham is now writing books just to get a book on the shelves. He spent little time developing the characters, and when the book was over I found myself not caring if every single person in the book dies. While the plot was interesting, the story around it was sparse.While not horrible, this was certainly not one of Grisham's better works. Perhaps for his next effort, he'll sit down at his word processor long enough to write something around 500 pages with a little more meat to it."
3,An incomplete work,"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed all of Grisham's previous works, but this one left me a bit disappointed. There was no ending, very little character development, and it really lacked the page-turning suspense that Grisham's novels are famous for. Who is the protagonist in this book? I didn't care about the 3 judges and couldn't even tell them apart. Still, I did like story about the CIA and electing the ""perfect,"" abliet republican, president. For that, I gave the book 3 stars. I just hope Grisham can redeem himself in the future!"
2,Disappointing overall,"I usually like Mr Grisham,but this book was a disappointment. The plot was not as interesting as usual; and the characters were all unlikeable. I did not find it humorous. As usual, he is a literate writer; but this book was not entertaining or enjoyable."
4,Classic John Grisham,"From the beginnings of two very different stories, a congressman about to run for president with the help of the CIA, and a federal prison in Florida where three disgraced judges hold court, John Grisham is able to weave an interesting and captivating story. Grisham draws the storylines closer and closer as the master storyteller he is. When they finally combine to the conclusion, the story is never dull. More engrossing and better flow than previous novels (The Chamber, The Street Lawyer). Still not the masterpiece of The Firm. A story made all the more interesting for its plausibility (almost). Set in the world of politics we can now watch unfold in national primaries. Well done and worth reading."
4,great,"this book is harder to get into than his others, its slow to start but it really quite fascinationg when its all over, nothing very significant happens which brings the climax factor down. but overall its another grisham great! he is a wonderful author! and this book like all his others is superb!"
2,Did I miss something?,"I read this book in two days - it is intrested and knowing author's earlier work I expected clear cut ending but it did not happen. The end of the book is neither bad nor good - simply there is no ending at all. Also, I like the message from this book - guys, blackmail others and make good life from it! I think it's a litle bit naive but if you have nothing else to do - read it. Grisham used to write better books then this one."
1,Pay Someone Else To Write Your Endings...PLEASE!,"I must agree with all of the reviews that complained about the ending for the BRETHREN.The book started off slow, but peaked my interest when the connection was made between the sub-plots. At that point, I read the book until the ending, because I thought ""Oh boy, this is going to be good!""NOT!I gauge how good a book is by how many times I want to re-read it. This book will join other Grisham hardbacks that are collecting dust on my shelf. The Street Lawyer (I can't even remeber what that was about), The Testament, and now The Brethen. Maybe one day I will wise up and go to the library before I go to the bookstore.Bottom line, the endings of Grisham books leave much to be desired. Even though I loved The Partner and have read it several times, I just could not believe the ending was so lame.At least he is consistent, if I read his next book I will start off expecting to be dissapointed."
1,research your topic next time...,"Simply his worst book ever. I am not a lawyer so I can't speak to how authentic his other books are, but on this one he blew it big time. If the devil is in the details, he's on nearly every page in this one, because he's constantly wrong in the details of Washington and political life. If I hadn't gotten a copy of this book free, I would have returned it to the place of purchase asking for a refund. Mr. Grisham, please next time do a little research on your subject."
2,Unpardonable,"Grisham's worst! After a promising start, the storyline goes from interesting to ludicrous. And the ending is simply unpardonable. Don't wait for the movie...nobody's dumb enough to make it."
2,Second Half Spirals Downward,"The lastest Grisham starts off with great prospect. I was really into the first half. Then, something happened - or rather didn't happen. The suspense just played out into a huge payoff and everyone goes home happy. Were we supposed to be rooting for any of the characters? I certainly didn't want any of them to be successful. This novel is comparable to a huge trial which settles 5 minutes before calling in the jury. All the promise of action fades and everyone just quietly goes away."
2,The Verdict is in...and it's not a winner!,"At one point, I would have described Grisham's writing as intense, devious and entertaining. This book is not impressive. I actually had to force myself to read it, while nodding off between sentences. The plot was ingenuous, however, the book missed it's point in the non-descript characters. In other Grisham novels, even if you hated the character or what they stood for, they were three dimemsional, well-written beings. The ""Brethren"" were three of the most tedious beings I've had the displeasure to encounter in a novel. The other characters in the storyline were equally as uninteresting as well. I have to admit, this was certainly a dissapointment. After such wonderful novels as A Time to Kill and The Client, both The Brethren and The Testement were a decline in work for Mr. Grisham, at least in my opinion."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I have read and liked several other Grisham novels, and I was sorely disappointed in this one. The characters were all shallow and poorly developed, and the plot was predictable from the first page. I found nothing enjoyable in this novel, from the greedy, corrupt and shallow characters to the easily predictable story line to the let down of an ending. There was no climax to this story, it just ended. ALthough not soon enough."
3,JG can't end a book,The Brethren will carry you through from start to finish in a fairly easy fashion. It's not tedious and it's not a tough read. It would be a good vacation book. But the ending was forced and left me wanting more. JG just can't finish them like he used to.
4,Grisham Again,"The Brethren started a little slow, but after a few chapters, it took charge of my mind until I finished it. I don't know how John Grisham holds my attention time after time. My thoughts center around whatever book of his I'm devouring until I finish. Now that I have just finished The Brethren, I'm already missing old Joe Roy."
2,Disappointed,"While this book was an easy and quick read, the ending was extremely disappointing. I'm a big fan of John G but I can not recommend this book."
2,The Brethren,"Colorful characters, as always, but the story did not move forward. Had to push myself to continue reading it. Disappointing."
2,Boring and disappointing,"I am a John Grisham fan. I have read all his books. I looked forward to reading this one, but I was so disappointed. I found this book boring, it took me weeks to read and in the end I was totally deflated. It lacked a 'punch line'..it was simply about 3 judges in a jail up to dirty tricks. My family was shocked that this book stayed so long at my bedside without being touched."
1,Disappointing,This is the sort of dissappointing stuff you get when an author gets too popular. Hope he does better next time!
3,A good read for a long flight,"I generally like Grisham's books. This was good as well. I was somewhat disapointed in the ending - thought he could have tied it up a little better. There were a few loose ends hanging. If you have never read Grisham before I recommend some of his earlier work first, but if you are getting on a long flight and need something to read, this will make the time go by faster."
3,Not So Grisham,"The book is very easy to read and has a plot that forces you not to put the book down. The book though is like a Grisham and a Clancy book in one. Over the years I have read all of John Grisham's books. This one was by far was the most disappointing. Grisham fans should read it just because its Grisham, but other readers beware the book lacks the interesting story lines usually created by Grisham"
5,I Love It.,This was a very good book. As usual Mr Grisham brought out caracters and tied everything together quite nicely.I probably would read again in time.
3,The Brethren,Rather strange for Grisham and anticlimactic in the end. Found the beginning much better than the rest of the book.
2,Good thing I did not pay for this book,"Grisham has been hit or miss with me. This one was definitely a miss. There are two major story lines that converge towards the end of the novel. One of the story lines was somewhat intriguing, but the other was odd and a bit uncomfortable. The end was disappointing too. I would recommend passing on this and read ""The Broker"" or ""King of Torts."""
1,Save your money,"I would hate to be the screen writer tasked with making this book into an interesting movie. Luckily I can't imagine that anyone will ever have to worry about that.John Grisham may not be the best at character development, or painting imaginative word pictures, but he has always been able to tell an interesting story. Until now. ""The Brethren"" contains not one likeable character and a story line that will leave you wondering if he spent more than 15 minutes trying to come up with a plot or if he just made it up as he went along.If this book were not written by John Grisham it would never have been published. Let's hope that Mr. Grisham takes a little more time in developing his next book and does not simply rely on his reputation to sell books."
2,Forget this one and re-read The Chamber,"This is clearly one of Grisham's weakest books to date. The story is not at all exciting, and his plot and character development are both weak. I found the book to be dry, boring and about 250 pages too long. Skip this one, and pull out an old copy of the Chamber. It will be a better use of time."
2,Disappointing fare,"Only die hard Grisham fans like me can read through this book. The plot is very weak, the story telling, save for some occasional flashes of Grisham one is used to, is bland and the ending is boring. You can't identify with any of the characters. All are crooked. The pace is excruciatingly slow and the climax is weak. All in all - disappointing fare."
1,Disappointing,I have been a JG fan since his first book. I always look forward to one of his new books coming out. Not this time. This book did not hold my interest at all. I was very disappointed in this book. As I was of The Testament.Mr.Grisham must be getting bored with writing. I will not be looking forward to his next book.
5,Sneak Preview Reader Give High Marks,"Brisham just takes the cake on this one. I had the chance to read this book three days ago and I could not find it in my to put it down. If anyone has a chance to read the first two chapters, you are missing out on a greta deal more. This book has it all and I completely recommend it to everyone. And this is comming from a college student!"
1,"Love Grisham, Hate this Book","Incredibly slow and boring. I had to force myself to stay in it. I gave up about halfway into it, even after a big turn of events in the plot. I just could not stay into it."
3,I do not recommend this book,"While this book is certainly well-written and gripping, the plot, especially the end, is shallow. In addition, the long-winded digressions about the presidential race are quite tedious to read."
3,"John, Are You Hungry?","Mr. Grisham: I know one must eat in order to survive. Also, one must feed and clothe one's family. However, I thought the profits from THE FIRM alone would have taken good care of you for decades. And, speaking of THE FIRM, it was a great book. But THE BRETHERN ... well, that's a different story. Please, next time, spend just a little more effort on putting the story together. However, I'm still a loyal reader and I look forward to your next book."
3,Only Average,"I like Grisham's books a lot. Couldn't put down THE FIRM and stayed up late with THE RAINMAKER and THE PARTNER. But,THE BRETHREN was a different matter. The characters were unlikeable and the ending a real disappointment. Let's hope Grisham spends a little more time writing his next book."
3,Mixed emotions,"Although I found this book to have a slow start, about two-thirds of the way through it picked up pace and became quite interesting, typical of Grisham books. However, the ending was entirely predictable."
3,"Good, but could have been better!","I am a big Grisham fan! But this book...i don't know...it seems that he knew a lot about John McCain and how this years primary season was going to play out because that's what I felt that I was reading, an inside look into one possibility of the McCain camp. The only difference is that there is a scam being run by these prison inmates called The Brethren. I wish that it would have focused more on The Brethren than this dual story line. I kept looking back to the front cover to make sure that Tom Clancy's name wasn't on it along with Grisham's. I am begging Mr. Grisham to back to his books of old. It seems that after The Client he took a turn with his story lines that are good, but nowhere near as awesome as his first four novels. Those were his best and I hope that he turns out more like that soon!"
3,Law Drama,This is an interesting book in the sense that it has a lot going on. It seems like everyone has an agenda. It could have been more in depth though and the pace could have been faster. There weren't really that many surprises for me.
4,A Good Read,"I find it really hard to believe that so many people are just tearing apart Grisham over this book. ""The Brethren"" is a good book -- it may not be another Firm, but it was enjoyable to read just the same. I have to agree that there was no clear protagonist and that I had trouble deciding who to like in the book, but I don't think that this fact makes the book terrible and boring, as so many of the other reviewers have said. I sat reading many times into the night reading on, wondering how the plot would unfold. If you're looking for an enjoyable book to read, I recommend ""The Brethren."" If you're going in with a negative mindset about the book, then don't read it -- but that goes without saying for most any book."
3,A Quick Read,This book kept me coming back. I did not however care for the characters and their lack of integrity but Mr. Grisham kept me interested enough in the plot to return. Who would ever think of such a scam? The ending left me wanting more. I felt somewhat let down. Not one of his best works but worth the time.
3,Good Read,"The Brethren isn't one of Grisham's best but it's a fun read. Plot-wise, it's pretty shallow, but it's easy to follow--sort of like a MOTW (movie-of-the-week).I am wondering if he is going to continue the Brethren story, because the end is very open and I would like to read more about these guys and their trials and tribulations.It's an interesting situation that just needs more development."
1,"NICE TRY, BUT...","I've read all of Grisham's novels and this one is by far the weakest. I guess he should be given some credit for trying to get away from the tired formula of some of his recent books like The Partner and The Street Lawyer, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. In general, none of the characters are well developed or likeable: the whole lot is two dimensional and mean spirited. The constant jumping between the two story lines is very distracting, even though a second grader could see where things are headed. The ending is very abrupt and unsatisfying, like he saw this was a story not going anywhere and not worth saving. I would bet that if John Grisham's name was not on the jacket of this book, it would be on the express elevator to the 25 cent bargin bin."
2,Not a good one,I didn't like this book at all. It seemed to me nothing really happened. It is just about a guy whose secret might get loose and that is basically it. I usually learn things from Grisham books but not in this one. I big let down. He needs to settle down and take more time to develop better books.
4,The Brethren Review,"In his latest book, The Brethren, John Grisham continues to excite the reader starting with page one. Through the book the story gets more detailed and intices the reader more and more. The reason for four stars is that a couple of ""loose ends"" are merely discarded and left up to the imagination of the reader, or simply handled in a confusing way. However, this book is very good and definatly one you would want to have on your shelf."
5,A great book,"Once in a while an author writes a book that seems to reaffirm the beliefs of all of his fans. The Brethren is just such a book. Grisham's newest is an incredible page turner. I recommend this book to all readers. I wont spoil any part of the book, but I promise that you will not put this book down."
2,The Brethren,"If the weather is cumberson and your stuck indoors and The Brethren happens to be the only novel within reach, grab an umbrella!Grisham sadly lacks in keeping the readers attention in this novel. Under contract, he is to write a yearly novel and this one lacks the Grisham style. Perhaps it's his deadline. But, readers, this is a one way dead-end street reading of 'just something to write' to satisfy his contract. Don't waste your time and let's hope Grisham comes back with a new knock down, on your seat suspense. Because this novel is not even close to his potential."
4,The Brethren,"I personally liked this book. People have to lighten up and understand that every book that Grisham writes will not be as brilliant as ""The Firm"". I found it to be interesting and believable. A good page turner.I look forward to his next book."
3,Not his best.,"I have read all of Grisham's books to date and this was probably my least favorite. I felt the plot just sort of ""ran off the page."" The ending did not measure up to the rest of the book.Perhaps the author is trying to mass produce books, rather than write really well-thought out mysteries."
2,Not nearly as good as expected......,"I have been an avid John Grisham fan from the beginning, but I was very disappointed in this one. Typically, his books are impossible to put down; however, this one just never grabbed my attention."
3,SCRIPT FOR ANOTHER MOVIE,Despite it's imposing length ... this Grisham movie script is a fine read. But the key is not to put it down for longer than a week ... then it becomes a strain to remember who's who.
2,better than street lawyer,"This was better than his last 2 books. The plot was interesting and he didn't preach as much as in Testament and Street Lawyer. However, as I neared the end of the book I kept wondering how he was going to tie all the plots together in an acceptable way. As it turned out, he didn't. The book just ends. I almost think he may be setting up a sequel"
2,You had me 'till the end,"This was my first Grisham book, so my expectations were mixed. The judges were predictable, the CIA / Lake plot was o.k., but the ending was a fizzle! Come on! Either the judges get their due, or Lake is assasinated. Anything but this!"
3,Decent book - a bit rushed at the end?,Good book for summer reading - was a bitsurprised at the quick (?) ending andthought the judges would be delt withdifferently.I've only read a few of his books andpicked this up for a quick read whileon a weekend/boating trip. Great bookfor a weekend of relaxation and needsome summer reading material.
3,A good writer getting slow,"Well, actually, I *did* enjoy the book. But it could have been so much more, with Grisham's proven ability to write a gripping yarn.Apart from the ending thats been (rightfully) criticized enough, there's another point here: it seems almost a dozen or maybe even more people within the CIA clearly know that the agency is trying to rig the election. Yet no leaks happen. Money is being dumped by the millions 'carried by the chestload into black churches and union halls', if I remember the phrase correctly, but no one remarks on it among the public.Add to that the rather weakly done 'russian scare' that supposedly makes it all necessary, and it was hard to keep away the disbelief at times.Still, technically good, and sometimes even gripping. If you like Grisham and have some time + money to waste..."
2,THe Brethren,"I read this book on a plane ride to England. While it comforted me the entire flight, I found the plot predictable and couldn't wait to be done with it. At times I was intrigued by the intersection of the two story plots but by the middle of the book, it was not difficult to resolve what was going to happen. NOt one of his best works but an ok read to pass time."
2,Not the best book of Grisham,"This was a strange reading, at first very interesting with the life of three lawyer in jail and then when the CIA director decides to have a new president who wants more money for the army, but when the book explains the debate of the candidates and the trips for their campaign, is really boring, you just don't know if you want to read it till the end or just leave the book and start a new one."
1,"Leaves you wondering ""What was he THINKING?""","_The Brethren_ is an untidy mess of a book, apparently written without any regard for reading pleasure. As others have pointed out, there is absolutely no admirable character drawn here. Worse, some of the least admirable characters (I won't say which) are richly rewarded at book's end.This book makes no sense, but it fulfilled its purpose in making quite a few dollars for Mr. Grisham (who has wisely given up writing ""thrillers"").The first few chapters are written with the old Grisham sense of humor and irony, but all that follows just plods on to a tedious conclusion."
1,"Boring, predictable, and terrible plot","The start of the book was interesting, but once the story got going...it was boring and predictable. Half way through the book I considered stopping or at least flipping to the last chapter because it was terrible and I knew how it was going to end. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time reading this."
1,Worst Grisham Yet,"I have seen this book described as a legal thriller. Nope! The law discussed is nothing but a twisted version of the law as dispensed by 3 convicted judges in a low security prison. And there was nothing that kept me on the edge of my seat, so I throw out the description as a ""thriller"" as well. This is, in my opinion, the worst Grisham book yet. The plot is sophmoric, character development non-existent, and overall a story that took an effort on my part to complete. Anyone who is looking for the Grisham style first displayed in ""A Time To Kill"" (his best book)will be disappointed."
2,A Waste of Time,"I listened to this book on tape. There were 7 tapes in the unabridged set. By the forth tape, I was fed up. All Teddy had to do was tell Lake when he first found out about the correspondence with Ricky. Lake would have given up on it and the Brethren would never have known about him. Instead the CIA sends its own letters and ends up screwing everything up and spending millions of dollars. If Teddy's ideas of dealing with terrorists are anything like his ideas of dealing with the Brethren, Grisham's imaginary America is in big, big trouble. The characters in this book are so trashy and the plot so unbelievable, I couln't wait to bring the tape set back to the library. I was particularly sorry because, for the most part, I liked The Testament."
3,Entertaining but not his best,"The book kept meintersted, but the end was a disappointment....who thehect was Teddy and why did Grisham make such a big deal about hispower to start a war, etc. when the plot of the book could have done just as well with out him? ....Trevor was my favorite character. I think Grisham is a fantastic author, but judging by his last 2 novels, he should follow Jerry Seinfelds lead and get out while he's on top."
2,Substandard for Grisham,"I've pretty much read all the work Grisham has produced. As a fellow attorney, this genre generally appeals to me, and Grisham rarely disappoints. In this book, he has created an exception to the rule . . . there isn't a single likable character in this novel; no underdog who manages to come out ahead . . . The premise was so implausible as to be laughable. Grisham generally paints with broad strokes, but he perpetrates a straight (and very 70's) stereotype of gay men: ""Let's name this one 'Percy', and lets let this one correspond on lavender stationary. . ."" Geez!The book is typical Grisham in that it is very ""readable"" - but it lacks the wit, the depth, and the PLOT of his previous work. As I read it, I wasn't thinking about who would be cast in which role, but whether Hollywood would even bother to buy the rights to this book. I can't imagine they would."
4,Very clever - exploits vanities and weaknesses,"As always, very well written by John Grisham. The use of an ""outside"" messenger (their lawyer) held the plot together - I found it difficult to put the book down, and even the kick in the ending puts a smile on your face."
4,Grisham brings us a tale of greed and secrets...different from what I expected,"This novel was different from others I've read from Grisham but still very interesting...definitely a good read. The story of three former judicial officers who, due to their criminal activities, find themselves guests in a low-security federal prison. To relieve their boredom and line their pockets they organize a scam preying on wealthy gay men whose sexuality is a secret and who want to keep it that way.Enter presidential-candidate Lake. A virtual unknown to the nation suddenly mad to see him in the White House. Lake has some very powerful backing with seemingly unlimited cash to fund his campaign.The circumstances that bring them all to an intersecting point provide a fascinating, fast-paced story."
2,Extremely Disappointed,This is definately not Grisham's best work. The story line dragged along slowly. The only other book by Grisham I have had trouble getting into was the The Chamber. The story line for this book was lacking. I kept expecting it to pick up and it never did. The ending only made me more disappointed. This is not a book that I would recommend with any enthusiasm.
2,The Breathern,"Brilliant plot and character developement and accurate in depecting human reactions to stessfull situations but the story dies when Trevor the laywer/mule dies. Trevor, the least culpable and benign threat but proved most ethical is killed for being a drunk. He's the fool who just wanted enough money to be left alone. The convict breathern the designers of the extortion ring suffers no penalties and get eveything they wanted and remain unsatisfied. And what happen to Quincy? His charater develope and is forgotten as was the other victims of the scam. And Aaron Lake the one who had the most to lose was fully protected by Teddy whose clarity and brillance resides only in hindsight. There are no redeaming qualities in this book but such is life."
4,Back on the right track,"I have read all of Grisham's books and I am glad to say although this is not his best work to date, I think that it was a good quick read. I was very dissapointed with The Chamber and if not for a recomendation to read The Testament, I would have sworn off Grisham altogether. These books are a step back in the right direction. The theme is somewhat repetitive, but that is not surprising since many authors use the same formula that has worked for them in the past. A book should not be judged by how hard or easy it is to make it into a movie"
1,He's gone commercial,"I have read all his works. Up to now he's been great, but I think the plot of this one is weak, predictable and shallow. His characterization fails completely,unless he was trying to write comedy. Perhaps he has to grind stuff out to meet contractual obligations, but putting the Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court in Federal prison with a couple of buffoons fails the test of credibility. As a retired attorney and a real Grisham fan, I was terribly disappointed."
2,MY FIRST GRISHAM BOOK AND PROBABLY MY LAST,"What happened here? The story dropped off into space, what there was of it. The characters were unbelieveable and there really was no real plot. I was very disappointed in this book after having read ""Void Moon"", ""Plum Island"" and other authors. Because of Grisham's name alone I bought this book. Waste of time - read something else. That's my recommendation!"
4,you really can't judge a book by its cover,"So, I picked this audiobook up at the library and the cover looked so ominous like it was going to be super serious. It's satire . The whole story is political satire. Feels like something a brit would come up with.It is two stories really. One about three imprisoned judges in a white collar prison playing a nasty get rich scheme on conservative billionares who can't tattle on them.And also about a elderly sadistic head of the cia(who loves herbal tea) buying a president using scare tactics. It kept me interested and had me shaking my head. No one is very nice in the book, but all the characters are interesting. I could see them in my head. Esp teddy maynerd and the dumbass antisocial lawyer who is stuck in margaritaville."
3,Lack of excitements but yet still a fair good read.,"Though I haven't read all of his work, i do enjoy what I have read so far. This is my second book I read that's from him. THE CHAMBER was revitalizing for me and I still enjoy the story. In THE BRETHREN, though it didn't come close to the first book I read from him, it was still good. There are parts of the story where it's boring when Teddy rambled on about war. This story was easily to guess what's going to happen next, but I did guessed some parts wrong. The ending wasn't that exciting, and in this story he made a quick ending which I wasn't really happy with. The book is only 250 or pages (depending what issue) so just read it. There are some parts funny and the whole idea of secrecy. Basically is about a mail scam from three judges in prison. I'm 15, so if your around my age, I probably have this one slide by for most."
3,"Well written, but not exactly a page turner....","This is my second Grisham book. I read The Testament and liked it well enough. Grisham is a good writer in that he has a formula that he's mastered, but alas, after reading The Brethren the only words that come to my mind were, ""and the point was?"" The plot could have had a lot more twists and turns. This book is not a must read, but it'll do in a pinch."
1,Extremely Disappointed Grisham Fan,"I have loved every one of Grisham's books and I had anxiously awaited his next book. I commute by train over 2 hours a day and I read a lot during my commute. I just couldn't motivate myself to read more than 60 pages in this one. It's like Grisham was just trying to fulfill a contract. I even preordered it because I was so excited that a new Grisham book was about to be released. What a let down! I loaned it to a friend, also a Grisham fan, and he was very disappointed too. I was also going to loan it to another friend but she had already read it and she was disappointed too.Don't waste your time or your money on this one."
3,Fast reading; kept my interest,"While this book is not up to Grisham's earlier works, I still found this enjoyable and fast paced. After the previous novels, I've been questioning why I still read Grisham, I did enjoy this one & will stay with reading Grisham novels."
2,CHANGE THE FORMULA,I liked the plot but the story lacked punch and fell into a very predictable story line. The ending is very dissapointing. Alot of things were left unexplained in my opinion. I would skip it.
2,Too many characters left hanging,The book spends too much time on the judges and lawyer shuffling money around. Grisham also could have developed the characters a lot better. We learn nothing of anyones background except for what the judges are in jail for. There are a lot of characters in this book and no ones story is ever finished. Who wins the election? What happens to the CIA chief? What happens to all who were blackmailed? I don't know. This certainly wasn't a page turner for me. I think the premise was good but the development needs a lot of work.
4,An Overall Great Grisham Novel!,My two favorite John Grisham novels are The Testament and this one. I thought that the storyline was wonderful in the Brethren! I liked the characters and their great descriptions. I thought that the ending was not too great. But it left you hanging and made you wonder if there is going to be a sequel. Great work JOHN!
2,one of Grisham's weakest yet,"Who wants to read a book about dirty old men who want to sleep with younger men, and get blackmailed by some prisoners? That's one of the two main plotlines of this book. This is one Grisham book that I found easy to put down, and hard to pick up again."
4,Another good book from Grisham,"If you like Grisham, you'll like this book. One of his better efforts, it moves along on two fronts that eventually come together in a satisfying conclusion. Character development is excellent, suspense constant, with a relatively abrupt ending being the only downside to the book.The book tells the story of three judges spending time in a federal penitentiary in Florida and a con game they are running on unsuspecting marks on the outside. A parallel story is that of a Presidential Candidate, his run for office, and all the intrigue associated with a Presidential race. Twists and turns abound, keeping the reader's interest throughout. Be ready to read for awhile as this book is hard to put down."
2,Disappointing and predictable,"I've come to expect much more from Grisham. The plot was thin and predictable with none of the twists and turns in his prior works. The characters lacked development and depth and the story was all in all quite predictable. This was certainly an example of an author resting on his laurels and delivering little in the way of compexity.Entertainment for an afternoon, marginally better than TV."
1,Not the usual Grisham,The book never reached the usual Grisham writing. The plot was predictable after the 2nd chapter and contained to much transition between ideas. It is as though Grisham wrote the book without preparation. My first thought after reading it was that he only did it to fulfill a timeline on a contract with his publisher. Overall - Thumbs down.
2,Second Worst Grisham,"Grisham will probably never write another book as bad as The Chamber, but this is the worst of the rest. As with most Grisham novels it has an interesting set-up, but in The Brethren you never really pull for the characters or care about the ending."
2,No value for your buck with this Grisham....,"Thin, slim and no meat in the 'Brethren'. I like John but he has to slow down a develop a deeper plot with more twists and turns. I think he is too busy trying to work his books into his tax deductible vacations, i.e. Monte Carlo.From now on when I read a Grisham it will have 'Property of the Canal Fulton Library' printed inside. Sorry John."
2,Intriguing plot; boring execution,"The Grisham name once was synonymous with excellent writing and page turner plots. The Brethren has a great plot and sub plot, but they never really were well developed - no real suspense or excitement. The characters were ho hum but could have been very interesting and mysterious. As for the ending I still ask myself ""Is this the end?"" I feel like I should reread some parts because I must have missed something. So much meaty stuff left unfinished. I hope he isn't planning a sequel because I won't buy it. In the story voters ask frequently ""Who's Aaron Lake?"" including me who wants to ask what has happened to him? I would have really liked to have read about his bought Presidency and just how he handled the country's affairs and the other situations he was involved in. However, Mr. Grisham thought not to follow through. Now I ask ""Where is the ""old"" John Grisham?"""
1,Another typically awful Grisham ending,"Why do I keep reading his books? Grisham keeps writing stories that start off being extremely intriguing, as this one does. He really needs to figure out how to finish these stories, or get someone else to write his endings for him! This book had the potential for a really great wrap-up, but I had chilling memories of the horrible ending to The Firm when the Bretherens' lawyer has dreams of taking his money and sailing the Caribean. Great idea, lots of potential, then horrible finish."
2,"Good Story, Bad Ending","I have enjoyed many of Grisham's works and looked forward to the Brethren as well. The story was developed nicely, but seemingly fell apart at the end...as if Grisham was in a hurry to end the story and did so in a rather quick and sloppy manner."
2,Disappointing,Mr. Grisham should stick with his tried and true writing style instead of trying to venture out. There were too many characters for me identify with. I wasn't sure who the good guys or the bad guys were. Disappointing - I wish I had bought the paperback instead to cut down in costs!
3,Long Awaited,"I pre-ordered my book in January, since I am an avid fan of John Grisham.The book kept me riveted from beginning to end wandering whether these three judges would get there come-uppance. Unfortunately, they did not.I am looking forward to his new book."
4,Good book but quite a disappointing ending,"Highly complicated plot, yet easy to understand. Grisham is starting to be like Jeffrey Archer and all the other masterful story-tellers. I must say that I personally love the plot a lot, because it is not so much about the boring law stuff which he usually writes about. The ending was a bit disappointing because I would expect Alan Lake to go bust, butb he didn't and the resolution of his downfall was somewhat simplistic. Other than that, I would encourage all thriller-lovers to read this, I finished it in only 2.5 hours."
2,Flatliner of a book...,"Although the plot was interesting, Grisham did not develop the characters as well as he should (could) have.The story didn't have the surprises, twists and turns that other Grisham novels are built around. I frequently thought to myself, ""I knew that was going to happen!"" or something along those lines. The climax/ending was unremarkable.If you haven't bought it yet, take it out at the library or wait for the paperback version."
5,Maybe his best,"What a page turner! Grisham's characters are easy to visualize as well as dislike. And what a plethora of bad guys to choose from... The ultimate test of an author is ""does the reader want to find out what happens...?"" I couldn't wait to find out...Bravo Grisham!"
5,"JOHN GRISHAM'S ""THE BRETHREN""","GREAT BOOK - AS YOU CAN TELL BY MY ORDERS, I AM A BIG JOHN GRISHAM FAN.THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT - I RECOMMEND THE SELLER HIGHLY."
2,The Brethern,"Reading this book was like listening to Barry Manilow...... I ask, ""Haven't I heard this song before?""....different title,but similar lyrics, and melody. It's a quick read and very, very disappointing finish after such a buildup. I feel like I wasted my time."
2,Put The Bretren up there with Gone with the Wind,"Grisham has done it again! The man cannot miss! Yes! I loved this book, and I've read twice already. The thing is that it's so sad and upsetting but I am a tad bit sentimental. Anyway, you should read this book it is sooooooooo good. I think I'll write song about it. Something like: The Brethren Yeah! Brethren Yeah! You're a good book Yeah! Oh I love you as I do the flowers of spring time and crispy, fresh mountain air, oh Brethren I love thee."
2,One of his worst,"This book was really disappointing. Grisham deviated quite a bit from his other books to write The Brethren. Three judges are serving time in prison for various offenses. While in prison they a lot of devious things, such as blackmailing wealthy gay men through a magazine ad. By accident, the Brethren snag the wrong person in their scheme and become the CIA's worse nightmare. Suddenly their get rich quick idea has tossed them into deeper waters than they ever counted on. If you're looking for Grisham's typical lawyer/greed books, you won't find it here."
2,Not the Best,This book had me going for a while but towards the end it left a lot of loose ends and a weak ending.
2,Grisham has sold out!,"There's really nothing new to say that others have not already said. This is a really, really bad book! The characters are totally unlikable - there's not a redeeming individual in this farce. It takes at least 150 pages to see where this storyline is going and it's truly not going anywhere interesting or important. Can Mr. Grisham be so desperate for cash that he would actually pen his name to this piece of garbage. You're resting on your laurels, John. Soon you will lose the ""bread and butter"" of your supporting fans. Worse yet, you'll be nicknamed the male Danielle Steele. Woe is thee!"
5,One of the best yet!,"I have read or listened to pretty much all of John Grisham's novels. This one has now become my favorite. I do not know how to explain it but it kept me laughing and not wanting to put down the book. I think that the chemisty of the characters, from ""The Brethren"" to Trevor to how the CIA came into the story. For the first time in a long time I found some characters in a story that I really cared about. I would and will recommend this book to anyone."
4,not another legal thriller,"John Grisham scores with another masterpiece. This book has very little of the legal jargon which is customary for a Grisham thriller. I was left wondering where the twist was going to be and was very surprised not to find a huge twist. After the first hundred pages I could already predict the ending, but I was still forced to keep reading. Even without the huge unforeseen twist this is still a book I would recommend, not Grisham's best work, but something that is still very much worth reading."
5,THIS IS SUCH A GOOD BOOK!,"This is I think the first of Grisham's books that I read, and I keep coming back to it. The fact that it's something that could actually happen just makes it all the more amazing. The look into politics and how things happen (and why) is something that can't be believed. Some people say that this book is too mature for kids like me (I'm 15) but I disagree. I think that the issues that are dealt with are real issues that need to be talked about. People are too afraid of the subjects that are raised in this book (that is, gay people and also how politics works) but Grisham brings the issues up realistically."
2,"Intriguing premise, lazy writing, unsatisfying finish","Grisham sets up an intriguing premise, then lazily, sloppily follows through to an ending in which nothing happens, nothing is concluded, loose strings abound, characters learn nothing, and the reader feels cheated. Does he still write his own books?"
4,A good book but not his best,"I enjoyed this book but it was hard to find a ""good guy."" Three former judges sitting in a federal prison were trying to hook rich men by placing classified ads in gay magazines. Their extortion scam heats up when they hook a huge fish, the front runner in the presidential race. Thing is, this fish has the FBI on his side. I won't give any more away except to say that I was happily surprised by the ending. Grisham is an excellent weaver of fiction and he keeps proving it. I read the preview of ""The Painted House"" and it seems like quite a departure from the norm."
4,More interesting than just a page turner.,I liked this book from the beginning. The plot concerns 3 judges in prison who are running a sex scam and catch a presidential candidate. While most of the characters aren't likable they aren't unlikable either. The interesting part of the book is watching the interactions between the characters. While some books are filled with action and sudden plot twists this book is more subtle and always leaves open many different plot paths to hold your interest. My only complaint is that the very end could have been tied up a little tighter. If you start reading this book you will know by the end of the first few chapters if it is right for you.
1,Grisham's worst,"Don't go looking for classic Grisham. You won't find it here. This book had an implausible plot, poor character development, and a lame ending. A waste of time and money as far as I am concerned. Do yourself a favor, reread, ""A Time To Kill"" instead."
2,Did he phone this in?,"I was VERY disappointed with The Brethren. I found the plot implausible and the characters were just too ""perfect"". I struggled to get through this novel and I am a BIG Grisham fan."
3,"This could really happen, couldn't it?","This book left me wondering how often criminals in jails really do mastermind businesses to make money illegally and get away with it? ""The Brethren"" had many twists and turns and a few surprises for this reader.The story of three men orchestrating a money-making and blackmail scheme from inside a jail cell is original and unique. The fact that they stumble on a politicial seeking office as the President of the United States is an added bonus and one they want to use to their benefit. Thus begins the story.A fast-moving Grisham as usual, but the ending came a little too soon. Always a good read."
1,lame,"pretty lame effort. grisham is not that great a writer to begin with, but this silly story never really gets going. the basic premise is pretty weak to begin with, and with the amateurish wrting, it's tough to get through the first hundred pages."
2,Poorley abridged book,I have been told that the book was good. I wouldn't know. The abridged audio version chopped so much out of the story that I don't know much moor than I did from reading the dust jacket.
4,New fresh air in Grisham's work,"I've read all of John Grisham and even if he is changing scenario, the point doesn't change. Still a story about somebody who found the lack in the system. There is no black and white difference between what is right and what is not. But this time the court is in a jail and the CIA is moving the string of political."
1,ZZZZZZZ....,"Sorry John, the book is boring. I really tried to get through it, but it's just a slow, slow read. Characters are dull and there isn't any suspense. Hope your next one is."
2,"Long Wait, Big Let Down!","I am a very big Grisham fan and was waiting very unpatiently for the newest book. I found that I should have waited until it came out in paperback ( not to pay so much). I was very disappointed. It lost me from the first few chapters and was very hard to keep my attention, unlike previous novels.I kind of thought along the line that this might have been the first book he ever wrote and saved for a while but, it had great similarities to Clancy and other authors along the ""Clancy"" line. Although I didn't care for the book, I am waiting for the next to see if Grishiam can redeem himself and his work!"
2,The Brethern,"This is clearly John Grisham's weakest effort to date. The characters are not fully developed and those with the most to exploit, Aaron Lake, the presidential candidate, and Teddy Maynard, the reclusive CIA Director, drop off the face of the earth in the end. There is little suspense and none of the storytelling or intriguing characters that ""Testamant"" or ""Runaway Jury"" can claim. I am disappointed with this volume and will be careful when picking up the next Grisham installment. I can't imagine that this meets with the standards that avid Grisham readers have come to expect."
5,The Best Grisham Book,"The best book Grisham has written. It was far and away his most captivating and most well writen. Read it, you will NOT be disappointed."
2,Wait for the video.,"The anticipation of reading another Grisham novel was there. However, after a 100 pages it was by sheer determination to never leave a book unread that sustained me. The characters, plot and scandal were all there to create a novel that would rival ""The Firm"". The story came to a close before you were ready to decide who won or last. In the end the author took the easy way out - everybody wins and lives happily ever after. Hollywood may be able to salvage the book, but I recommend waiting for it to come out on video."
1,The Brethren,"A great disappointment in my opinion. As an avid reader of John Grisham I found it lacking in suspense and drama. The characters were dull and boring. It is very unusual for me to fall asleep while reading Mr. Grishams books, but I often did just that. Maybe a little time off wouldn't be a bad idea, as suggested in another review. On his next book, I won't be so eager to order as early."
1,Not at all what I expected ... or anticipated,"I didn't find the book full of suspense or intrigue. And fortunately, I was able to borrow the book instead of buying it.Yes, the plot was very different from his other books, and that in itself made me want to read it. And it was a good read - easy to keep track of who was doing what to whom. But the ending left more than just a little bit to be desired. Most of the events along the way were far too predictable.My personal favorite was A Time To Kill. This one is not in the same class as what I've come to expect from John Grisham."
2,Not What I Expected From Grisham,"I was very disappointed in John Grisham's latest novel. I have read all of his books and always look forward to the next release. This was a big disappointment. It is unlike his other novels, in that it lacks a real hero, or even a good lead character. When I read the book, I didn't enjoy it from the beginning, but I kept waiting for it to get better - it didn't! I should have listened to the reviews that I read on Amazon before I bought the book. I can only hope that Grisham's next book is more like his earlier novels."
1,Yawn,What a disappointment! Threads were left hanging and NONE of the characters ever fleshed-out. I don't think I will rush out for his next work.
1,ooookay and then?,"What in the world was Grisham thinking when he wrote this book? Probably the same thing Thomas Harris was when he wrote ""Hannibal"". ""Oh those crazy publishers will print and sell anything I write."" Good grief this was about as close to nothing as you can get. This is the person who wrote ""The Chamber"" a wonderfully affecting character study and also a social commentary on the death penalty. This book was a half baked idea that he pounded out just because he is John Grisham. If the writer of this novel had been anyone else we would have never read it because there is NO way this would have ever made it to print. Take a look at Dennis Lehane, and David Wiltse if you want a good read and leave this fluff alone."
1,Should Not Have Been Written.....,"Without a doubt his poorest written book yet...and I was an avid fan! Shallow storylines that do not resolve, and the ending...it's as though he just decided to stop writing it!"
2,Definetly not Grisham's best - possibly his worst!,"I have been a huge fan of John Grisham, and have read every one of his books. ""The Bretheren"" does not have the fire, the plot, or the characters most of his other fine books have. It was slow and poorly developed. The ending appeared to come one day as Grisham said "" I'm tired, I think I will end this""."
3,Not Grisham's best,"I like Grisham so much that I wanted to like this book. I did enjoy the Testament, so thought maybe he was returning to books with interesting and most surprising endings. The ending failed to impress me. It seems that he became attached to these people and did not want anything dreadful to happen to them. I did like the humor of these three."
4,Vintage Grisham,"The Brethren reminded me of Grisham's earlier books. I have liked all his work, but this plot kept me reading, finished it on one day while traveling. Great book."
2,Un-Brotherly Love,"I've always been a Grisham fan. But after the meandering of the Testament and now the unbelievability of the Brethren I'm beginning to think that maybe John has become just too hip or too Hollywood for his own good. What happended to the raw feelings of The Runaway Jury or the way he got us good and mad during A Time To Kill? John you've lost your edge!Take some time off now...really work on your next novel...be thoughtful...be suspenseful...Heck, just be the John Grisham of the late eighties and early nineties. We miss him and want him back!"
2,Not the same as his old stuff...,I just couldn't speed through this. I start his books at a moderate pace and speed up as time goes on - this just got slower and slower. I love his stuff but this one is missing.
2,"NO ""Thrill"" in Thriller","The Brethern was not Grisham's best work, the book has a great idea however he forgot the details and the suspense. The book moves along at a very quick pace since it lacks details.He should have taken more time with this one."
2,"Good, but not a must read!","John Girsham has put out a lot of excellent books, but lately they have not been gripping. The Brethren was a good book, but there were to many unanswered questions about the characters. We could have know a little more about Aaron Lake and some others. Also, I felt that John left the book opened for a sequel, I just didn't feel like it had a definite close to the book."
2,Very Disappointed,"I preorder the Brethren, couldn't wait to get my copy. I have read several of John Grisham's books. This book is the the most boring book I have ever read. I hope Grisham is not trying to sell on his name only. For now on I will think twice before I order another Grisham Book."
2,The Brethren,"There is basically no one to like in this book. The Brethren are three funny, but ultimately unlikeable characters, who belong in jail. Teddy and Aaron are willful and gullible respectively, and ultimately both are unlikeable. You'll feel sorry for the victims and at this price (even less discounts) you'll feel like a victim yourself.However, Grisham's serialized ""The Painted House"" in the magazine Oxford American this month is very good reading..."
3,Where's the ending?,I have not read other Grisham novels except for the chamber. I found The Brethren to be a very interesting read and really built interest up until the end where it concluded in a very disappointing way.
3,Typical Grisham - bad ending,"Grisham may be an ambitious writer, he tried to touch on new topics in each of his new novel. For this one, he tried to touch president campaign. However, the topic is much explored by many successful writers, it just can't stand out in this novel. Together with the typical flaw like many of Grisham's novel - sudden and bad ending, this certainly is just a so-so novel from Grisham. I still like his old novel, with more courtroom drama - like A Time to Kill. Much more interesting to focus on his legal expertise, may be."
2,Lacked Focus,"The biggest problem I had with this book was there was no protagonist. The book was about too many characters and at the same time was not about them enough. I felt there was a lack of focus brought on by the lack of any character that you could follow and empathize with. The Bretheran were all in jail for good reason and I have difficulty empathizing with criminals.Lake was a one-dimensional character who was little more than a plot device and offered no personality or substance. Teddy was little more than a stereotypical military/spy buerocrat convinced the sky is falling. None of the people in the story had defined characters, they were all merely paper dolls to fill certain roles. I found that made the book lack any feeling or emotion whatsoever.The story is interesting, trying to figure out how the different strings come together and where they will end up, but the utter lack of character development and no central protagonist really made this a poor novel."
2,Where's the ending?,"I am a great fan of Grisham's work; but, I was very disappointed with the ending of The Brethren. I always look forward to the trademark blockbuster endings but this book didn't seem to end...it just faded away."
2,Not up to expectations,"When you read a John Grisham book, this is what usually happens: When you've reached pages 10 to 20, you become hooked, pages turn themselves, and you're done in a day or so. Not this time. I noted it took past page 100 or so for the ""Grisham Effect"" to take place. This is not a bad novel, but the high expectations never happen. You wait for a character with some redeeming quality (the 'hero') to appear, but it never happens. You wait for the plot twists, but it merely bends. And finally, you wait for the surprise ending that is not there. A good, but dissapointing, read."
2,Disappointed and Confused,"I am a huge Grisham fan, particularly because there are always characters that you are left admiring, as well as providing a measuring stick for one's own beliefs. This book has no such characters. I was so disappointed and confused at the end. I kept looking for the three judges to ""get their due."" It never happens. Instead, it appears that all the bad guys win. Moreover, the homophobic undertones of the book surprised me, mainly because John Grisham has never shown any hint of prejudice in his books. Quite the contrary, if you think of the ""Street Lawyer"" and ""Time to Kill."" I hope that there is a sequel coming, because it appears that the story is unfinished. The end just cannot be as Grisham left it, and still be a Grisham novel. Hopefully, the next book will take longer to write and give Grisham fans the excitement, the sense of justice, and the gritty characters that have excited us through all of his other books."
2,Are you SURE this is a Grisham?,"Wow...talk about pre-pub hype! I admit, I bought into it expected one of his best yet and all but tore open the box when it arrived. That moment was the most exciting part about my whole ""Bretheren"" experience. Is this really a Grisham book? What happened? It was a struggle to maintain interest and finish. The characters are underdeveloped, the storyline tedious and the ending a complete insult to those of us who've fallen in love with Grisham's earlier work."
1,Brethren doesn't bond,This is the first time that a Grisham book disappointed me. The story line was not convincing and the ending was abysmal. None of the characters in this book were captivating. Better luck next time Mr. Grisham
4,Different approach,"Grisham is migrating. Read his first four books and compare to his last two. The Brethern is a two to one plot story that does have substance and some good laughs. The end was a bit flat, like he gave up and said it was finished. I liked the book because I like Grisham's style and I hope he keeps writing as he did. This is far better than The Chamber. Not his very best but if you're a fan, it's worth the read!"
2,"Is this a tv movie, or what?","Anticipating a new Grisham novel is almost as much fun as racing through one. Until The Brethren.The plot of The Brethren is still full of Grisham's clever twists, quirky (Southern, mostly) characters, money and high stakes. The differences with this book are that there is no hero, no likable character at all, and it is just too, too timely. Grisham is entitled to his political opinions--and entitled to his success as a novelist. But I felt after reading this one that it had been designed to fulfill--probably successfully--three purposes:1) to make more money, 2) to make still more money as a movie, and 3) to grind Grisham's ax about the government and the 2000 presidential race.I felt there should have been a dustcover warning: What you are about to read is a political statement; entertainment is solely secondary. Proceed at your own risk."
2,No end in sight,"I enjoyed the plot but agree with most everyone else..there was no end. It is amazing to me that such a gifted storyteller can end a book in this manner and not realize that he has not completed the story. I did not understand the ending and I don't understand how he can just drop a period at the end of a sentence with no closure to the plot. Doesn't he realize what he has done and that readers would be critical of this apparent abrupt disregard for bringing his plot to an exciting and thought provoking ending? He, as an acclaimed author, must surely be aware of what he was doing. What was going through his mind when the decision was made to end the book?"
1,Not even worthy of one star,I only gave it one because this review wouldn't post without one. I feel that this book was simply words on paper. I had little or no regard for any of the characters and consequently couldn't have cared less about what happened to any of them. There were also many logistical flaws in this book and I really doubt Grisham bothered to do any research at all in order to write The Brethren. I felt it was a huge waste of time and I'm very disappointed with this used-to-be-great author.
3,The Brethren,"The interesting concept got me to drop 20 bucks on the book. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a fizzler. I don't want to ruin the ending but I was expecting more action and suspence like in Client or Firm. Grisham could have done a lot more with the concept and he let it fall short. Now don't get me wrong, it's a great change from the Testament but it still isn't as good as so many of his other books. I'd wait for paperback. In 6 months or so it will be on the paperback rack and actually worth 6-7 dollars"
2,Buy only in Paper back.Hard Cover not worth the extra money.,"The book starts out with good characters, does nothing with them and has an extremely weak endding. You will feel like you do when you go to a movie theater and walk out feeling like you should have waited and rented it instead."
2,A Major Let Down,"Have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed only for it to have such a bad ending that it ruins the whole thing?That's what happens in the Brethren.The book starts off with two separate storylines; one is about three judges who have wound up in a federal jail in Florida and the mail scam they run, the other about a politician who has been designated the next President by the CIA.You know somehow that the two plot lines will merge, it's just a question of how. Unfortunately, by the end there is no real resolution to the story the book just ends...a real disappointment to an otherwise better than average book."
3,A Lesson in How to Tell a 100 Page Story in 360 Pages,"The Brethren continues to showcase John Grisham's decline to mediocrity. The premise of the book is very interesting and had a lot of potential, but Grisham made it a very straightforward book, avoiding the complexities that made his earlier books very entertaining. If you really stop and think about it, this story doesn't have much meat to it.Another problem with this book was that he really doesn't have a hero for the reader to root for. I didn't care for the tactics of the three imprisoned judges, nor did I get enough of a feel for Aaron Lake to care much about him. Again, this was something that was a part of his earlier works that has been missing in recent years.I have said in other reviews of Grisham books that he cranks these books out way too fast. You can count on a new Grisham novel to come out the early part of a year. I wish Grisham would take his time and write a really good story, something I know he is capable of doing."
5,They are never the same...,"With the majority of mass market autors, you are guaranteed the same kind of read over and over. Not grisham. The Brethren focuses on a little clan of judges in a low security prison setting up a get rich quick scheme that will guarantee they are set up for good after jail. They lure the men in through placing ads in gay magazine and then track down the men who reply. This leads to the perfect extortion scheme because these men don't want to be found. They make a mistake with one of the men and it just gets better. if you like Grisham, you'll love the Brethren. Not his best, but great anyway, you won't be disappointed."
2,Just kinda drifts off...,"Great premise and could have been an extraordinary story, but it appears that Grisham forgot to flesh it out past a Hollywood treatment. Reading the last few pages, I was on edge waiting for the EXPLOSIVE finale. Didn't happen. I think that he was already into his next big, blockbuster, chart-busting, top o'the list bestseller and just shoved this one to the side..."
1,Definitely a disappointment,"For me this was the most disappointing Grisham novel yet. Unlike some of his more polished stories, Brethren lacked the essentials of a good novel. Certainly nowhere near the underlying psychological tension of The Firm, for example.Character development was weak, the plot lines were strained and the hypothesis completely unbelievable. The ending failed to bring any sort of critical denouement to the storylines and seemed as if it was thrown together because the author ran out of typewriter ribbon. It may sell a lot of copies but I'd only recommend purchasing this if you are the ultimate diehard Grisham fan...or if you just want to read a sodapop novel, have it taste good and then burp, it's gone."
1,"Quite simply, Mr. Grisham's worst.","I have enjoyed a few of Grisham's novels to pass time on long flights or the beach. Most have been enjoyable for the genre; that is, don't take it too seriously. Obviously Grisham is an author looking to sell books, rather than write a strong story. I think he does have it in him, I would certainly welcome the attempt.The Brethren is by far his worst. I am embarrased to have read it and finished it. The only benefit I can see in my ""accomplishment"" is that I can save others from such a folly. Read anything, just not this."
3,Good plot and story line ... but ...,"I enjoyed reading this book right up to the end. And that was the problem, the end. I felt like this book had been written with a page count in mind, because the fully developed plots and the story line are simply closed off without a real sense of closure."
1,The Brethren,"A friend gifted me with The Brethren and I ulitmately got through it after putting it down and thinking that, since no book could possibly be that bad, it had to get better. . . but, it did not. The Brethren is worthy of inclusion in the bottom 10 list of the worst books of all times, right below The Street Lawyer (which I bought myself and vowed I'd never buy another Grisham book). This silly silly book had nothing. Nothing. No developed central character or no plot that anyone with an IQ approaching the imbecile level, or above, would believe for a nanosecond. On the other hand, it was so pitifully bad, it was funny. I get it! Grisham's done a comedy. (It would have to improve to deserve even one star.)"
1,Ugh...,"It appears as though Mr. Grisham -- much like the characters in this awful book -- is too busy spending his royalties before they're received, rather than concentrating on his writing. A poor effort that shows little regard for the reader."
1,The Brethren,"Don't waste your money on this one! I am avid Grisham fan and have all his previous books and some ""doubles"" but the subject matter and direction of this one is NOT Grisham to me. I returned it after reading first three chapters for refund. Sorry, John but...."
2,Disappointing,"I was disapointed with this story. There was no suspense as in previous stories by Mr. Grisham. Just when you thought the story would take a turn it didn't. I dare say it was predictable. There were no ""good guys"" and no ""hero."" In past stories by Grisham his characters had principles, not so with anyone in ""The Brethren."" Very disappointing and almost depressing. The darkest story Grisham has written."
2,Not a page turner,"I love John Grisham--especially Testament and The Partner. I was disappointed that I purchased this one in hardback. I had read the first chapter on the net and thought it was a little slow, but I figured it would speed up and be as good as the previous books. I went ahead and purchased the hardback and it continued to be slow. I had a hard time getting into the plot and was bored through parts of it. I really did not like how it ended. Would I recommend it to my friends--only if they borrow my copy."
2,Not his best work,"Well, where do I start? I really enjoyed Grisham's previous works but this one just never takes off. Many, many, loose ends. Seems like the book was beginning to build and it ended in two pages! Very disappointed with this latest offering. Hope he get recharged and comes back strong. If your going to miss reading one of his books this is the ONE!"
4,"Very good, but not John's best!","The Brethren is a book, like alot of Mr. Grisham's, that you just cant put down. It keeps the suspense up, and keeps you coming back for more. It may have been just me, but it seemed after i picked it up, and like a second later, i was done with the book. It was a real quick read, but good one at that. He's written better, but this one is pretty good as well. Just a little on the plot.. basically, 3 judges in jail have a mail scam going on, and eventually they catch the wrong fish :) Thats all im going to say.. do yourself a favor and pick it up if you want a good, quick read."
1,Disappointing,"This book was a real disappointment, and I am an avid fan of John Grisham. Maybe he is turning books out too quickly; they just don't have the interesting storylines and great suspense they did several years ago. I had a hard time getting through this one, and was really glad to be done with it. I didn't even care how it ended. It just wasn't ""The Firm,"" ""The Partner,"" or ""The Rainmaker."" I won't rush out to buy his next one."
2,WAS able to put it down!,"As much as I love Grisham's books, this one was a bit of a disappointment. It did not have the ""flow"" of his other books, and I found that it took me longer to read this book then most of his other lengthier books. I thought with the mail scam the judges had going, some mention would be made of federal postal inspectors involvment, but he did not choose to go there. The ending was a bit of a surprise, but also a disappointment---would anyone who had received such a lucky break be that stupid? If you have never read any of Grisham's books, do not judge him on this one."
4,Pretty good book,"I got stuck on a couple of Grisham's books and was unable to finish them (the rainmaker and one other i can't remember the name of), but this one was good. not really like the other recent books, i liked how many people were tied into the plot who seemingly had nothing to do with one another. there was no love interest, but that was okay."
4,Grisham lo mein,"To me John Grisham books are like chinese food. I crave them, once I get one I wolf it down, and afterwards I ask myself: Why did I do that?If you liked ""The Firm"", you'll like this book too.It is predictable, but I think this is more than compensated by Grisham's honest and accurate treatment of the law. Plus, it's an amusing premise: 3 disgraced judges ""doing time the federal way.""Good beach book!"
1,Unbelievable!,"It only took about 75 pages for me to wonder how this book could have been published and why would anyone pay 20 plus dollars to purchase it. To say that the plot was paper thin would be kind, this plot was totally unbelievable. Why would Grisham think that we would believe that the CIA director could tell the Presidential Candidate about secret mass murders but he couldn't tell the Candidate what the CIA had found out about his personal life. Give me a break. My advice is to not waste your money or your time."
3,Disappointing Ending,"The plot is excellent, up until the end. Grisham has some great ideas, and keeps the pace and interest up, but really disappoints at the end. He could have done much more to make the ending more plausible and interesting."
4,Judges in Jail. COOL!!!!!!,"I passed on the last few Grisham books, but as a lawyer I couldn't resist reading about judges in jail. (Could there be a song in that?) While this does not live up to Grisham's early novels, it is well written and has lots of intrigue. It is certainly worth a look."
1,Unbleieveably amateurish!!,"I was one of those who could not wait for the next Grisham novel. For whatever reason I had not kept up with his latest couple or so. This one, was obviously written for one reason, and one reason only, to catitalize on his name. It is without question one of the worst books I have read. The plot(?) is telegraphed within the first couple of chapters. There are virtually no suprises in the whole book, except for the fact that there are no suprises. Character developement is shallow, superficial and meaningless. Rotten Read! I will have to pause before reading ""The Testament"" which I have available."
2,huh? did it end there?,"i never really found myself enjoying any one whole page of the book, nor did i like the book as a whole at all.the characters were too unbelievable to be interesting. and the whole plot just didn't seem real at all (maybe even less real than the worst of jeffrey archer's books). plus, the book stubbornly refused to offer any climax.it turned out that i was a very patient person. (surprisingly) i finished the whole book. but i did that only based on the expectation that grisham would be kind enough to save the readers from total frustration by giving them a good/surprise ending. but as if he wanted to tease those who endured all the 400+ pages, grisham ended the book just in a way one would end a chapter.after ""runaway jury"", this one and the like, i was no longer sure if i would pick up another grisham's book."
4,"I like John Grisham books, but...","I would really give this one 3 1/2 stars, I guess. Of course, the plot is suspenseful. What I have a problem with (and I probably have had the same problem with the last two of his books) is that the story gets good and then he just ends the book. It's like he realized that is was plenty of pages so we'll just end it on the next page. Great book - just don't care for the abrupt ending."
2,A disappointing effort,"I read this book with great anticipation. It had all of the elements necessary for me to love it: a tawdry plot, interesting characters, and a political story line (its so hard to find good political fiction). Yet this book is so disappointing. The ending seems to be building into a cresendo and then thud. You feel duped and betrayed. A decent book but nothing like I expected. If Grisham doesn't shape up soon, I am going to have to stop reading."
1,The Brethren,It seems to me that once a person has made a name for themselves in the world of popular fiction their writing deteriorates. Once I had been introduced to all the players in the book it was predictable and therefore boring. It was just too easy and pointless. If this had been another author would this book have been published?
2,A Truly Disappointed Long-Time Fan,"I cannot believe that John Grisham wrote this book. The ending was foreseeable from the first chapter. Still, I continued to read it hoping that there would be the usually twist in the plot. I finished the book with the oddist sensation. It was not one of surprise that I would normally experience but relief that it was finally over.I am glad that this is not the first John Grisham book that I have read or it would be my last. I have faith that whatever took place during the writing of this book is over and his writing style will return to the great books that we have come to know and love."
1,A very poor effort on Grisham's part,Very disapointing. Not much effort by Grisham here. The ending was very anti-climatic. I will think twice before buying another John Grisham novel.
2,this book goes nowhere,"I don't know what got into Grisham. Maybe he is getting bored. Maybe he had a contract he had to fill, but didn't have any ideas. Anyway, the book starts out with a reasonable premise. But there is no real suspense in the development and the end. The story went nowhere and finished flat. I'm glad I read the library's copy and didn't spend money on this."
2,BLAH!,"Usually I read Grisham with guilty pleasure, staying up well into the night until it is done. With this book I find myself taking a nap all the time - it literally puts me to sleep. And I have to force myself to continue. These characters have no redeeming value and the story is depressing and manipulative."
2,Not one of Grisham's best,"A bit lame- the story is original, but it doesn't tie up, especially the end which is disappointing. I still can't figure out why some people get killed and others don't .........! But, as a great fan of Grisham's, his style is still impeccable and his character descriptions very amusing."
3,Felt Let Down at the End,This unabridged cassette audio book kept my attention for a 1500 mile drive. Read well. But the ending all happened too fast...I felt rushed...and the weak ending didn't compare to the rest of the book. Disappointing. I imagined an ending much more exciting than Grisham wrote.
2,Where's the suspence?,"I thought that the book was okay, but nowhere nere as good as what I hove gotten used to. The plot was predictable and there was no suspence. I read it just because I am a Grisham fan, but I thought that it needs a longer ending. It wasn't really boring, but he can do better."
3,Finally a Grisham book that I finished,"I really enjoyed this book. I went to the book page and was surprised to see such a low star rating from other readers. I am a divorce attorney and when I read Grisham I usually don't care for it because the law environment he tries to create is ridiculous. This book was strange but good. It's not realistic but it doesn't pretend to be. This is just a story. It does leave you with a glow and thinking but you do want to keep reading it and by the time you decide the story has fragmented, you only have a chapter or so to go. Sometimes I won't finish a book like that but this one I did. That says something in itself because I buy about 5 books every two weeks and will not finish most. That, for me, is a good review."
1,"So, I was wrong","I have read every Grisham book. My husband likes to buy me the hardcovers when they hit the shelves. When we saw this one in the stores, my husband asked if I wanted it, and if I thought it would be good. I said ""Of course it will be good! All of Grishams books are good."" Now I have to tell my husband I was wrong. I don't know if I can forgive you for that John."
1,If you get this book from someone for free...,"If you get this book from someone for free, it is still not worth reading. It is like going to a bad movie and leaving the theater wondering what all the fuss was about. Grisham's publisher must be pressuring him to write for the sake of the almighty dollar, because little effort has been put into this book to even give it a chance to rank up there with his earlier works. John, if this is the best you can do at this stage of your career, please quit while you are still on top. Your fans deserve better!"
3,The ending . . .,just trails off as if Grisham didn't feel like writing anymore. Interesting storyline (and characters) comes to an abrupt and somewhat contrived end.
2,A Grisham filler?,"Mr. Grisham certainly has his up's and downs. This book is clearly a weak effort. Although, to be fair, it is entertaining to a degree. But this is not why I look forward to Grisham's next book and, I suspect, not why millions of his fans tune in. I expect excellence from his work (Firm, Partner)and must admit that this seems to be a real ""satisfy the contract filler."" Sorry, John. I know you can do much better."
2,great read until the end,"this is my second Grisham book. I liked the good story telling and interesting characters. The end was terrible, unimaginative, and unsatisfying. I was sorely disappointed."
3,Page turner,Another great story by John Grisham which reaches deep into our government politics. The ending could have been better. I would recommend this book.
2,Great book....until the end,"Grisham is by far my favorite author. This book though....well it just stops! No real ending, it just stops. There isn't a conclusion. I don't know how else to put it....very, very disappointing. But I'll NEVER stop reading his books. One dud in ten is a pretty darn good average :)"
2,Just churning out books,Grisham starts out with a great idea and great political timing then I think a weekend rolled around and he wrapped things up early. The Brethren would've made a dynamite 800 page thriller but he turned it into a subpar 300 page novelette.
1,Very disappointing,"I used to be a Grisham fan, but you can be let down by a writer just so many times. His last books have been mildly disappointing. With The Brethren he has conceived the most unbeliavable plot line, characters appear and disappear for no logical reason. Everything in this book is so one-dimensional and contrived that you never forget that it is only a piece of fiction - and bad fiction at that. Mr. Grisham was never a great writer, but he was always good entertainment. Not anymore."
3,"Okay, but needs a better ending","The story line was interesting and fairly quick-paced, however, the ending is lacking. The storylines are tied up too quickly and I would have liked a big twist or surprise ending like in other Grisham novels."
3,Pretty good,"The Brethren was a pretty good and interesting read however I've seen much better by Grisham. It was nothing like The Firm, The Client or Innocent Man, which are some of my favorites by Grisham to todays date. I just bought the Partner and I hope it's a good read."
5,Thrilling Extortion Plot,"Grisham knocks another one out of the park with this novel.A rather clever blackmail scheme entangles a potential Presidential candidate.However, that's just one tangent to the story. Along the way, the ""Brethren"" attempt to unravel and lives of men who are hooked in by an ad in a magazine. The threat of having their lives turned upside down causes these men to go to rather extenuous lengths to protect themselves.None of them have as much at stake in this scheme as Anthony Lake. The uncovering of his secret lifestyle has repucussions that must be prevented at all costs.I've read this book twice, and found it even more enjoyable the second time through. Highly recommended."
1,Populism for ever!,Mr.Grisham should give a decision.Earning money easily being over-populist or being a respected writer?
3,Shallow but somewhat engaging,"Compared to some of Grisham's great books, this was a disappointment. As always, his book had a clever premise, but that's about it. The characters were not likeable and were really poorly drawn in my opinion. There was no believability in the way the plot unfolded either. Having just completed a fantastic book by Nelson DeMille--The Lion's Game, which was filled with excitement from the beginning, Grisham's Brethren seemed a poor offering."
2,NOT ONE OF HIS BEST,"When reading this book, I kept thinking of a ""Three Stooges"" episode. Although the book was somewhat humerous, it lacked the type of depth and meaning found in some of his other novels such as ""A Time To Kill"" and ""The Testament"". I thought the ending fell very, very flat and it appeared that the author was in a hurry to complete the novel."
1,There is a plot...but that's about it...,"Grisham peaked with ""The Client"" and ""The Brethren"" is just another book continuing the downward trend. The basic plot is there, but it lacks development and passion. The story dragged on without suspense or excitement. And as for the ending, what ending? It is as much of a wash as the rest of the book. If you are looking for mindless dribble, then by all means, buy the book...but I'd wait until it's on sale...in paperback."
3,Where is the hero?,"I just finished this book and am wondering ""Where is the hero?"" in the book. The book was a good read and enjoyable but it lacked the hero to root for. The Rainmaker, the Firm and others had us rooting for the young lawyer. The Pelican Brief had us worrying about the law student. This book lacks a protagonist that the reader can empathize with. When I had about 20 pages left in the book, I found myself wondering if the judges would be killed and not caring."
1,Disappointing,"The book is a complete disappointment. The first half of the book was typical and built the characters and the story, then something happened. A tight web was woven with the CIA monitoring all the mail and somehow a letter which pulls the plot together gets through the web? Was there no way to pull the book together other than to rip off the reader, hoping that nobody would notice? There was no second half to the book, after the letter gets through the story goes down hill rapidly. I gave the book one star because I had to, but I feel that John Grisham owes me that star back. I also resent that I bought this book. I have bought every one of John Grisham's books the day they hit the street, brought them home and devoured them. This book was a real disappointment for a true fan of his ability to write good, believable, enjoyable books. I have to hope that he will make it up to me with his next endeavor."
3,Not his best,"I love John Grisham and will read whatever he writes, but this book was a bit of a let down. It is always exciting reading Grisham books because he fills the pages with suspense and the ending often is a surprise, but in The Bretheren, I read the last pages and wondered where the twist was going to come in. It never did. I felt empty reading the last page and questioned where I went wrong. I didn't have much feeling for any of the characters and felt the ending was not typical Grisham quality. It appeared that in writing the book he got tired and then just ended it. I was disappointed but will always be a great fan of John Grisham and continue to await every new book."
2,A waste of time,"Brethren was a huge disappointment. Does this sound familiar: underacheiving, greedy lawyer who wants to escape to the islands? The ending was about as exciting as kissing your sister. Grisham needs to go back to being a lawyer. Or he needs to escape to the islands himself."
3,What was the point?,"I read all of John Grisham's books and consider him one of the best authors of our time. However, on this one, I think he was not up to par. I could never really understand where he was going with this one. The story seemed to take you in a certain direction, then just drop you. The ending did not pull things together, nor did it make some kind of statement. I got the feeling at the end of this story that nothing had been resolved in the characters lives and we are just kind of left wondering what it was all about. Far from his best, but still better than many other authors."
3,What happened.,"This book like all grisham books was great, however on the last page i ask myself what the hell happened, someone please tell me what was going on was the judges starting the same thing over or what, i am stumped."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Implausible plot, not one character with any redeeming values, poorly written....and the WORST ending I have ever read. This book is horrible and is a mere shadow of his better works."
2,Not Typical Grisham,"Although it isn't Grisham's best work, I have to admit that I couldn't put it down. Yes, there are a lot of flaws, but it still makes for good fiction. The big disappointment was the ending. I wonder what was going through Grisham's mind whe he wrote the last few pages. It is worth reading but be prepared to be somehwhat disappointed."
5,The Brethren,"A marvelous book of conflict and resolution. John Grisham brings out the true meaning of suspense. I have read five of his books. When I began the ""Brethern,"" I didn't think it wold be nearly as well written as ""The Client"" or ""The Street Lawyer."" Thankfully I was wrong. There are many characters, you have to play close attention durth the first few chapters. After that it's an easy and exciting read. I look forward to more books by him in the future."
1,"Good premise, poor execution","I bough ""The Brethren"" driven solely on Grisham's credentials, not bothering to read the reviews. Big mistake! I can't believe Grisham dropped so low after writing so many engaging stories. I am saddened his been bitten by the same bug that damaged a few of today's best writers.The writing was repetitive. Characters were flat; none were likable. The ending was disastrous. It appeared Grisham wrote this one half-heartedly, as if only to meet a deadline, to meet a commitment to produce a book, any book, not literature.I've read The Rainmaker, The Partner, The Testament, The Runaway Jury, and The Street Lawyer. None among his best, all better by far than this flop."
3,Oh God!,"I love JG ever since i read one of his books. In Malaysia, i could only found the brethren on nov 2000 (paperback). I've already been reading its review early last year in the internet and was very much excited to read it. So all the suspense and excitements of waiting for the book to be released was such a waste. I've never read his books before for more than a week. But this one.....i think it's forever. I only finished it today after purchasing it on 6/nov./2000...So you can imagine how bored, frustrating and anti-climax it was. Come on JG, you can do better!"
2,Waste of time and money,"This book, similar to the ones he has written in the recent past was a waste of time and money. I bought it thinking that this will be a better one, but, NO. The begining was allright but as one reads along there is no suspense or excitement anywhere to grasp your interest. I am thouroughly disappointed and wouldn't recommend anyone buying it."
1,infuriating,"The Brethren features an intricate, suspenseful build-up. And that's it. The book just ends, with no satisfying resolution to all the seeds it's planted. The story is completely absurd and a monumental waste of time, and should be retitled ""Really Much Ado About Nothing."""
5,GRISHAM DOES IT AGAIN!,"This is far by the BEST Grisham novel I have EVER read. First, of all I have to say I LOVE the characters, 'specially Spicer, Beech, and Yarber (also known as the ""Brethren""). I also loved the plot and storyline. If you love Grisham, buy this book. You won't be sorry you did!"
5,A Terrific One!,"I simply don't understand why almost all of the reviewers of this book on Amazon.com hated it! I thought it was excellent - an extremely daring move on Grisham's part. I suppose it was disliked because it was different - but the world would be boring if nothing ever changed! I thought the storyline was interesting, and the two plots came together nicely. I definitely recommend this book. It's worth the money!"
4,"Actually fun, if you don't take it seriously...","This was a fun John Grisham novel. Sure, the characters are sleazy, people are killed, etc, but behind the whole thing the author was clearly enjoying himself. I enjoyed it more than most Grishman novels. In fact, one could argue that the entire book is a meditation, a condemnation, a spoof of national politics--but I doubt that the intention...maybe it was. Anyway, it is a fun ride that is not typical Grisham--which is a good thing. One thing that is very spooky, is that book was written in 2000...Grisham had the threat of terrorism to the United States nailed perfectly. I wonder if he thought of this book on 9/11. Oh well. Good read."
5,another good read,i've never been a reader until this year and i picked this up from my local library because it sounded interesting. it delivers on everything i expected. great.
3,Trapped in a Prison with The Brethren,"An interesting idea for a theme. An extremely fast read, yet it had a feeling of plodding along through a predictable, shallow plot. There were no characters with which one could identify, at least for the average mainstream reader who is not a member or former member of a Federal mimimum security prison, or who is not hiding a secret life. It was only a fast read because I kept waiting for the depths of a John Grisham novel."
2,Bad Grisham,"This book is about three retired judges running a scam, against closeted gay men, from prison. It is also about the director of the CIA grooming a political puppet to run for President. It takes about two minutes of thought to figure out how these two plots intersect.If you are a Grisham fan, you will read this book. Otherwise, just skip it."
2,Poor Ending,"It took me a few chapters to get into the book, but then I was hooked. I couldn't put it down. When I finally read the ending, I was very disappointed. There is no sense of closure and the ending is totally unbelievable. I can't accept that the government would have gone through that much trouble to let them all walk off into the sunset with a bunch of money and no records. In the real world, they would have disappeared."
3,Is it me?,"Call me crazy, but I think that 343 uses of the phrase ""buck wild"" is excessive. I know, Grisham is trying to add truth to the particular milieu, but please. Likewise with the constant and irrelevant peppering's of ""Where my dogs at?"" What was the rationale there? That's the real mystery."
1,Poor at best,"If this is the best that John Grisham can do, he ought to give up writing novels. It is trite, mundane, boring and has no intrigue."
1,"Excuse me, your moralism is showing.","Grisham built his reputation on the superb suspense of ""The Firm,"" ""The Pelican Brief"" and ""The Client."" In ""The Chamber"" he slid into preachiness, but his mastery of the thought and speech of the unrepentant southern rake produced enough verbal zingers to carry it.""The Brethren"" has rakes but few zingers, and the preachiness has metastasized, along with an endlessly repeated image of gay men reduced to quivering jelly at the threat of exposure, an image that might have flown in the 1950's. (In ""The Street Lawyer,"" he simply dismisses gays as ""queers."")Petulant criticism is unflattering to any writer, but a clumsy, unbelievable plot in addition to it, make this the worst thing a book can be: boring. BORING."
4,Thinking international,"There is no doubt that john grisham is a good writer i've seen the ohter reviews saying the book is terrible or so,but i think as a reader whose main language isn't English the book has an easy understanding and the story is very smooth if u want somthing cool to spent your time The Brethren is a good option (and others be optimistic about your reviews)"
2,Grisham? Are you sure?,"What a huge disappointment. I look forward to my yearly February read of Grisham's latest novel. This one was a jumble of characters, none of them believable. The story line was pretty good, but I just couldn't get into it. If you are a Grisham fan, you will be very disappointed."
1,Worst yet!,"John Grisham has reached a new low in ""The Brethern"". After taking us on some fantastic rides with his earlier novels, Grisham has slipped into a quagmire of average writing and predictable plots. He needs to step back from turning out novels for the sake of a buck. I know that I'll wait before I rush to the store to buy his next novel."
2,The Brethren,"I have read all of John Grisham's books, and I am a die-hard fan of his, but I found The Brethern to be disappointing. I usually devour his books and read them sometimes in one night because they are such page turners, but The Brethren I kept putting down because it was boring. I didn't care for any of the characters, the ending was lame, and the story line was very unrealistic. If you have to read this book, wait until it comes out in paperback, or borrow a friend's copy. You'll be glad you saved your money. Let's hope next year's book is better."
1,fulfilling a contract,"Just like a rock group with a contract for so many albums a year, Grisham barely fulfilled his contract with Doubleday. I hope Doubleday doesn't renew his contract. Grisham laughs all the way to the bank, at the readers expense."
1,Redeeming qualities,"So I get a Amazon gift certificate for Christmas and I say to myself, gotta get the new Grishham. Loved the last 2 - The Street Lawyer & The Testament - they had people who you could root for and who ended up having some sort of redemption in their lives. In other words, all Grishham novels up to now had ""anti-heroes"", but they did the right things for the wrong reason, or the wrong things for the right reason. But there are no such characters in the Brethren. I think the author had so much bad feedback from the Testament that he had gone Christian or had lost his cynical touch, that he just gave us all cynicism and no heart in this book."
3,Why such discontent?,"I'm not sure why so many Grisham fans found this book so objectionable. I found it to be an interesting change of pace. He brought his characters to the table via parallel plots and ultimately wove them together. There was action and resolution, pathos and intrigue. I disagree with the reviewer who said that Grisham usually has a moral/ethical thread to his novels. It has been my experience that he seems to have anti heroes as often as not. There always seems to be someone coming out smelling like a rose who's actions appear to be a bit tainted. I have one complaint and one warning: Please, Mr.Grisham, do not go the way of Allen Drury and Tom Clancy. I am so very sick of ultra right wing political blather. My complaint is that the book should have ended on the fourth to the last sentence but all-in-all I really enjoyed this book."
3,Light Reading,"As opposed to most of his other books, that is. I enjoyed the book, but it is not nearly as suspenseful as most of his others. And as other reviewers have noted, you really don't find yourself able to root for any of the characters. But since we are in the middle of an election year it certainly gave me something to think about."
2,What happened to all the twists and turns,I am a big Grisham fan. This book was just plain! Where are all the twists and turns his books usually take. The story was one I could read and put down. Usually his books keep me hooked. Life is too short to waste your time on this one. Read A Time To Kill if you want great reading.
1,John lost his steam,"I always loved Grisham's works, before the Testament. I kinda fond of The Rain Maker, The Runaway Jury too, I think they're John's best novels. But now...... Come on John, certainly you could make something better than this? Kinda getting boring, I think. Always screwed up the government, always connected with high money (or dirty money), could you think another subject John? I'm sorry to say this, but I'm sorry for buying this novel."
3,good read--but lacking suspense,Much anticipation but the end result was rather disappointing. The storylines were unique but lacked suspense. The ending was mundane and uneventful. I felt this was his weakest attempt at telling a story.If you must read this book try to wait for the paperback and save yourself some money.
1,Fulfilling a contractual obligation....,I think he called this one in. Very unsatisfying. Not finished
1,Poor imitation of a novel,"There is no intrigue, no ending, and took effort to continue reading. It appears to have been written just to make (not earn) money. I feel like writing Mr. Grisham and asking for a refund."
3,Disappointed,"I just finished The Brethren, and as stated above I am somewhat disappointed. While reading the book, with its carefully crafted plotlines I failed to develop any empathy for any particular character. In short, I felt that Grisham could have developed some of his characters better, especially Lake. As for the ending I agree with others in believing it could have been developed better, not a blockbuster ending but something with more depth such as in The Partner."
4,The Brethren,"This was most UN-Grisham, but good. I liked the fact that it didn't STRESS me out! It isn't a thriller as most all his previous books have been, but the plot was intriguing and quite ""light-hearted"" as Grisham books go. I hope he continues along this same vein."
2,It's not worth H/C price. Buy it on paperback.,"Thoroughly disappointed. John wrote a movie script, not a novel. Where is the climax? Who's the good guy and who's the bad guy? John took the easy way out with ending and there wasn't any intrigue as to what could and should have been to Brethren. Why take care of Trevor in one way and deliver different fate to the Brethren? John is losing his touch and this is the last H/C of his I bought."
2,Good...but not worth the effort,"I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do. It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character. I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one."
1,Writer creativity or computer generated?,"With his latest novel, The Brethren, Grisham seems to have crossed that threshold of an artistic writer to one who is churning out words for commercial reasons only. Perhaps even using a commuter to generate some of the text.How else can you explain the fact that one of the characters in the book, someone who has been involved one way or another with the legal profession for many years, didn't know the meaning of ""pro bono"". Just one of many examples that makes the novel extremely juvenile in structure and character development.The story line is weak and the character development even weaker. The writing is such a far drop-off from Grisham's earlier novels I even wonder whether he actually ""wrote"" it or generated it using some computer software program."
2,Disappointed,"I am a Grisham fan, but this book was definitely subpar. While it started out as a promising book, it ended up just being boring. The end was very predictable, and there were few plot twists. I would recommend some of his other books (Partner, Firm, Time to Kill), but not this one. I agree with a previous reviewer that said that the last half of the book seemed rushed - perhaps by an overly eager publisher."
1,"Dull, Shapeless, Boring, Bland","I thoroughly enjoyed all of Grisham's earlier novels, such as A Time to Kill, The Firm, The Client and The Rainmaker. However, with THe Brethren, the trend begun with the Partner and The Street Lawyer was continued: uninteresting characters no one cares about, a predictable plot, slow start. In his early works, there were always one or two characters I truly cared about, but not so this time. The only half-interesting person in this book was the 23yearold with a 48 year sentence, Buster. I didn't root for Trevor, nor did I care about Aaron Lake, the CIA, the three judges or any of the others. Frankly, I think Mr. Grisham is running out of plots."
2,Another Disappointing Grisham,"After Street Lawyer, I said I would never buy a Grisham book again. And I haven't, I borrowed both the Testament (which I hated) and The Brethren. I just couldn't get into The Brethren. The way it skipped between the prison and political story lines kept me confused, and wondering how they were going to tie in together. I felt like through the whole book that it was going nowhere. Nothing to keep me wanting to continue after each chapter, no character to ""root"" for, and nothing special to really stand out. I also felt like the ending was thrown together, like maybe it come deadline time and John wasn't quite finished. To sum it up, The Brethren is not worth the time or money. If you must read it, wait for the paperback or borrow it."
2,Where is the story?,"When I read a novel I want to be lost in the characters. It's fiction. It's an escape. This book is so blase, you keep thinking something's going to happen. It doesn't. I'd like to know why the author wrote it. I keep thinking there must have been something he was trying to say."
1,John must be tired -,"Having read all of John's books and finding that the last couple were not as good as the earlier ones, I was hoping that The Brethren would be in the spirit of the earlier books. This was not the case for me. In fact, I found this bood to be most disappointing. The suspense was not there. There was a 'dangling' sub story that went nowhere (did John forget to show its significance?)The 'joining up' of the two stories was not very believable even for a novel. The ending was 'cute' but left me feeling cheated. I was hoping for a Grisham ending that would let me say WOW! Instead it left me saying that I wasted my time reading the book. Sorry John, but you need to get energized before you write your next book."
2,Good until the End a BIG DISSAPOINTMENT,The book was well written until the last 50-100 pages. The ending was a very big let down from such a great author. I wish I had waited for the paper back version. It was not worth the hard cover price. I cant wait and really hope John Grisham can improve the endings fo future booksand that he will not feel rushed to finish the next novel. That is what it seems happened to the Brethren. the first and middle are well written then just falls short.
1,Don't stay up late to read this book !,"Night after night, I tried to keep awake fighting myself through this endless and boring book. What should I say: Battle lost, deeply disappointed, especially about the ""end"" of the story: It simply doesn't have one. What a waste of time, what a dramatic drop after ""The Testament""."
2,What's the Hype?,"I've only read one other Grisham book. I would by far not consider myself one of his fans. The Brethren sounded good, so I picked it up. It started out slow, I had no idea where things were going. They met in the middle, but there was no climax, no surprise, no twist, no excitement. The ending was completely dull, and left me wondering.... what was he thinking? Coming from an avid reader, yet not a die hard FAN of any author, this one wasn't so wonderful. There was nothing exciting about this book."
1,A disappointment!,"I have read every book ever written by John Grisham. In ""The Brethren"", I found the characters weak and the story line slow. I can't tell you how many times I put the book down out of boredom. The ending was a disappointment. I found myself saying, "" Is that it?"" I admit, when I finished ""The Partner"", I was angry, I didn't like the ending - but at least it stirred some kind of emotion in me. This book left me cold."
4,This is a good book!,"The content keeps you interested into what will happen next even though the reader might think he/she already knows. Although this is not as good as The Firm, this kept me interested!The plot and content might be out of the ordinary,but again it keeps you hooked.I read this book in three days time! Cannot understand why others gave it such a bad review."
2,A loaner,"A friend loaned me this book. On finishing it, I'd decided two things. One, I am glad it was loaned to me and I did not buy it. Two, I'm sorry my friend bought it. A recent generous newspaper review listed as the most memorable part the section where it went for fifty pages without switching back to the campaign subplot. As I said, this was generous. This book just missed the mark. Maybe the next one?"
2,"Wow, Mr. Grisham, what happened?","Extremely disappointing, kept waiting for the book to reach the reason it remained #1 for weeks and weeks, it never got there! Almost seemed that Mr. Grisham had a deadline for one more book, so over a weekend he wrote one, weak plot, characters with virtually no development, thoroughly predictable and basically a story without no twists or turns... most disappointing compared with his past works...John, What Happened?"
1,waste of time,"If you really want to waste your time, go ahead. No plot, no ""characters"", no ending is a pretty good summarization of this misuse of paper. I think Grisham needed some money, and so he sat down one afternoon and just wrote about any old thing which he could think of."
2,A little disappointed,"When the story got going (after about 100 pages), I thought it was going to take off. While an interesting plot(s), the storyline could have been a real page turner- instead it just dies-and the ending was very disappointing indeed. It leaves you with way too many unanswered questions, and I felt Mr. Grisham was just plain tired of writing, and wanted to end this novel as fast as possible. I've truely enjoyed some of his works in the past, but this one I wish I had skipped."
2,Grisham Has Lost His Edge,"Like The Testament, The Brethren meanders and finds nothing in the end. Grisham seems to have lost his ability to create suspense and excitement. His previous novels were filled with suspense and rivited me to his pages. The last two have left me with ""so what! ""Grisham needs to re-focus or we will need to find another writer."
2,The Brethren,"""The Brethren"" simply does not measure up to previous John Grisham books. The plot runs out of steam way before the end of the book. The ending if you can call it that was very disappointing."
2,why bother?,"While I am a big fan of his, this is probably Grisham's most unsatisfying book since The Client. None of the characters involved were worth caring about, and apparently Grisham has picked up on Michael Crichton's habit of bad endings."
2,Was it a book I don't know,"The book read like somebody was full filling a contract quota. I was a fan of Mr. Grisham but I think after this poor showing I believe he has falling to my ""b"" list of authors. On the other side I just finished reading ""The Testament"" after the Brethen and enjoyed it very much. I don't know maybe he has contract that made him this last book. I sometimes wonder does Mr. Grisham want to be author or screenwriter."
2,Grisham-lite,"The latest offering by Grisham is a disappointment for those of us who were expecting the same riveting intrigue as his previous novels. I found the plot to be predictable and the characters were uninspiring. This was definately ""Grisham-lite."" I've read better Nancy Drew stories. I expected to see that he had only loaned his name to this effort."
4,Fast read!,"I thought this was a pretty good book. The plot was interesting and unique. I finished in just over a day and I am not a big reader. There was plenty going on to pique my interest. Not as good as ""The Partner"", but solid none the less."
2,Didn't do it for me.......,"Unlike most of Grisham's earlier efforts, I found this one plodding at best. Never mind the hero, I couldn't even figure out who the protaginist was."
3,"Where is the hero? - Review of ""The Brethren""","In his latest novel ""The Brethren"", John Grisham forgets the key component of what makes his lawyer-courtroom saga formula so successful: the Hero. With no clearly defined protagonist, the reader has no one to root for in this unfortunately simple novel. While it is a relief that this latest novel does not have a preachy subtext (death penalty, save the rainforests, tobacco), it is missing the crafty heroes of his previous works. ""The Brethren"" is a nice, quick read for fiction escape artists. But unlike a ""Time to Kill"", its not a must read."
1,Cure for insomnia,"I like Grishams work - except for this one. Unfortunately, there really isn't a character that I ever really care about, and nothing ever really develops in the story line. It took me a couple weeks to wade through this one; where usually a good book will last a day or two. I actually forgot that I was in the middle of reading it at one point and started rereading an old favorite. Forget reading at night - I literally fall asleep within a couple pages! If I had it to do over again - I'd definitely wait for paperback, or pass on it altogether."
2,What was missing from this book,"There was humor in this book as characters began to unfold. Later, there was disappointment that you never really connected to them. I wasn't pulling for anyone or against anyone either. There was no innocent victim, no hero and lastly no women or love interest. I'm afraid this book was rather boring, which is a shame given the enjoyment of previous books."
2,Not Up To My Expectations,"This book was off-the-mark for Grisham...I've enjoyed all of his other endeavors and although there were differences in style, i.e., The Chamber vs The Street Lawyer, this one just didn't measure up in the reasons his others were successful...no tension, no thrill...both plots were insipid and dull. I kept waiting fot it to get better and then it ended..."
3,"Entertaining, but hardly great","After a few sittings of ambivalent reading, as opposed to being anxious to get another chapter in, I finished The Brethren. I was a bit disappointed in the ending, and I thought it was fair overall. Sometimes it seems like his books are going along great, and then they suddenly wrap up without enough detail to make it as viable as I would like. I started it while stuck in an airport; maybe I should have picked up a couple of magazines instead. I liked it less than The Testament, but a lot better than The Street Lawyer."
2,YAWN,"I used to anticipate a new Grisham novel. I couldn't wait for it to hit the shelves. Unfortunately, this will probably be the last Grisham novel that I purchase in hardcover. He never explores Lake's unknown side and offers him as a very shallow main character. While the premise of the novel promises a page turner, it is a true turn off. Not his best, but as of now, definately his worst. My advice to the author: Take some time off and re-evaluate your need for the million dollar bonuses for the amount of books you sell and think more about the millions of readers that you are disappointing."
2,"Not ""Great Grisham"" work","Despite my admiration for John Grisham and his immense talent, I was very disappointed in this book. I could not find one character with which to bond, no one to root for, and an ending that left me listless. No plot events ever grabbed me and I never found myself awaiting to read more. Come on, John. Don't let the publishers rush you! Take your time on the next one and give your legions of admirers what they missed this time."
3,"OK, but can't hang with Grisham's earlier books","The whole subplot with the Presidential election and the CIA manipulating the whole thing is pretty interesting. However, seems pretty unlikely. Still, if you have a weekend with nothing to do, you can finish this book in a short amount of time and will be pretty entertained."
4,The Brethren captivates your imagination,"For those of you that see plots and subplots as the driving force in the world of politics, this one is for you. In today's world, the one with the knowledge has the power. Enjoy how the power shifts as the character's in this novel gain and lose power based on who has the knowledge. And it is scary to think the power that some have over others in high places. It also makes you wonder if you really have any privacy at all. This book was a speedy read, even though it was 400 plus pages. The plots flow quickly and smoothly. Enjoy it! EJ"
2,Lost...,"John Grisham almost had a good thing going, and then he blew it. The rising action and the climax is great, as well as the character description, but after that the book falls really short of expectations. The ending is even worse than the plot sequence that leads up to it. I don't know what John Grisham was thinking when he wrote this book, but he should have put more time into it. Maybe his next one will be better."
1,"review of ""Bleachers""","This is the most boring book I have read in a while. The Bleachers. I am afraid that JG is churning out books too fast and that his stories are becoming crap. Reminds me of Harold Robbins....I think JG should go back to the first book he wrote...A Time to Kill, and reflect some before churning out another book. I was very disappointed in The Bleachers and am now hesitant to read his next one...I would wait till it came out in paper back before purchasing any more of his books."
3,"Judges, Gays and Mr. President: Three Lifestyles","When I read this novel I know a little rough ideas of the three group of people we in Malaysia see very little. Even not accurately, Grisham (and his researhers) gave me something to talk about with friends regarding judges, gays and Mr. President ( I bluff sometime).After all this book is Grisham's at his average mood. His writings are witty and entertaining but the basic idea is simple. Only colorfully decorated with weird people and background"
4,The meaning of Brethren,"BRETHREN: This is a plural word for 'brother' as shown in dictionaries. Nowhere in the book, this is written. This is a complo theory as usual in Grisham books, with a introductory preface section for his new book, to make the readers edicted to his series. Easy & impressive to think on last presidential elections, predictions on Bust period in future to expect."
3,An okay book.,"I have come to really enjoy Grisham's books over the last year. He is definelty a talented writer and his stories are compelling. However, The Brethren is not his best work. I like the story line but it has little suspense. One of the characteristics of Grisham is the endings. Each time I read one of his books, I get to the end and seem to say to myself, OK, and that's it. The Brethren is no different but it is a decent novel and if you find Grisham to be a great a WRITER as I do, you will want to read the book. If you have never read Grisham before, read The Street Lawyer or The Summons first."
4,A Good Beach Read,"This story of how three corrupt judges accidently snare a ambitious political figure is definitely fun and fast to read. Grisham seems to be writing with a sense of humor and it's reflected most heavily with the judge's characters. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that there are no redeeming characters. The judges are greedy,homophobic extortionists, the lawyers live up to the stereotype.It would've been nice to have one person you were rooting for like in ""The Firm"". Still, if it's a mindless, not taxing read you're looking for, this is it."
3,A great book....,"It is a great book by John Grishan. It will capture you from the begginig until the end, no doubt about it. But sometimes in the book the author gives to much details, some of them totaly discardble. But in terms of the story, it is great. It's about three judges that are in jail for different reasons. But when they are inside they work together and have all kinds off scams against all kinds of different people to try to get money out of them. And now they have the perfect target..."
3,A fun story,"I liked this one. After reading ""the testament"", I shyed away from Grisham - this one was on the shelf for 6 months and I thought, what the heck. It isn't extremely complex or as suspensful as ""the firm"", but I got lost in the story and wanted to know how all the players would come together. I found the main characters likeable and found myself cheering for them. All in all, I read it during a sick day, and it was entertaining and funny, the politics believable and the story not to heavy."
2,Is Grisham getting bored?,"This novel like all the others starts out boring and slow. If you can last until the completion of the 4th chapter that is when the real story will begin. An adventure sometimes if you happen to live in the South to places you have actually been to or heard of or seen. Then come the end, ho hum, no justice, no excitement just wondering why you wasted your time... BR>I have purchased and read every paperback Grisham has written and these endings are just a turnoff. I would like to see some variety."
3,...strongly disappointed.,"I loved The Testament and The Partner, but The Brethren is just not a good book. It's slow, unoriginal, and unfortunately, unable to keep my attention.I don't know what went wrong, but this one just can't deliver; his old works are keeping him famous, but this one is just down the drain."
2,What a disapointment,"I am a new reader of Grishoms, and although I enjoyed the story line, I was very dissapointed with the ending.....Sean"
1,pitiful. the reader doesn't have any imagination pitiful.,i am dearly sorry to say that this book failed to stretcch my imagination
3,Not his best,"I look forward to Grisham novels, too, but this was not one of his better books. He usually has at least one character that you can empathize with and care about. Not in this book. They're all scum. I didn't care what happened to any of them. Is he tired of writing about lawyers and judges? In any case, it's well written and an easy read."
3,"Fine to listen to on tape, not worth the read time","I listened to the book on tape in the car, and am glad. It was good, clever, and interesting. However, it was not good enough where I would have wanted to sit down and devote the time needed to read it as a book."
2,Not good as far as Grisham goes,"I've read all books written by Grisham, and this one lacked the engaging excitement that i found in The Partner, or The Pelican Brief for that matter. When Grisham started, his leading characters were mostly young, perfect lawyers. Later they weren't so perfect, as in the Partner parhaps, which is nevertheless one of the best books ever written, or the Testament. But all his books had protagonists; leading characters who kept the book together. Perhaps the greatest failing in this book is the absence of such a character."
1,His Worst,"Of all the Grisham novels I've read--and I've read nearly all--his best was his first: ""A Time to Kill."" Even his lesser efforts have had strengths. Until now. ""The Brethren"" has nothing, unless you like a trivial story that starts and goes nowhere, one-dimensional characters you won't care about, and plodding dialogue. A big disappointment for a longtime Grisham fan.""A Time to Kill"" proved Grisham can write. The rest of his books prove he can also make piles of money. But ""The Brethren"" suggests either that he can't write anymore, or that nothing matters to him but the money."
2,"Slow Start, Weak Ending","Not Grisham's best effort, co-existing plots are intertwined in a clumsy manner. The dialogue did not read true, and some of the twists were unbelievable--even for fiction. I'm still trying to figure out the message Grisham was trying to impart to the reader."
4,It Kept Me Reading,"I am surprised by the negative reviews. This book kept me reading. It definetly wasn't the choice of words; it was the intrigue created by the plot. If you pick this up, you will finish it. And yes, I enjoyed it...even though it leaves a bad taste in your mouth afterward."
2,Very Mediocre,"I once heard Larry McMurty talk to a group I was in about WHEN Authors start going down hill-----and I thought about John Grisham in that context while reading THE BRETHEN---and I have read every thing he has written.I put it down twice before I could get into it, and even though the stories within stories were engaging, they were unrealistic. The ending leaves the reader completely empty, like sayin ""So what happens next."" Will likely NOT be made into a movie!"
4,I'm gonna buy this one!,"Looks great! I browsed on the Brethren and will get a copy. I learned never read reviews anyway. If publisher really fails me up to the last chapter, then, so what? I know John's got a story to tell. Keep it up JOhn!"
5,"Different Grisham, But Better","Firstly, The Brethern is not a ""normal"" Grisham book. I was expecting something like the Testament, the Firm, the Client, etc, and so I was immediately disappointed. I soon regreted buying the book. ""He's trying to be Clancy"" I thought.One you get over the fact that this book is like that, it becomes very good. If you can accept the fact that it was written so as to be easily converted into a movie, it becomes great.There are two problems with the book. Firstly, the begining is illogical. Saying what it is would be saying to much, but it's bizaare.Secondly, the only ""good"" character gets at most two pages. All other characters, while occasionally likeable, are scum or cheats or conspirators.However, the it very well written, it has a satisfying ending, and I advise buying this book."
2,Disappointing Grisham,"The Brethren is a disappointing followup to Grisham's previous works. The plot is contrived and implausible. There is little character development. Indeed, there are no likeable characters or even characters with which the reader can identify. Since this is a presidential election year, it seems Grisham stretched to come up with a topical plot. It didn't work."
1,glad I didn't pay full price,"After having read all 11 of John Grisham's books, I can only say that this is the worst yet. There is nothing to draw you into the characters and the ending does nothing to give the reader closure. The characters are shallow at best, and there's no page turning excitement. Grisham needs to start writing like he did in A Time to Kill and stop trying to write instant movie plots. I can only say, if you MUST buy this book, do so in paperback."
2,Shame on Grisham!,"I was a huge fan of Grisham until The Testament (verbose and way too many jungle chapters) and was hoping he would return to his page-turning style. He did, at the beginning of The Brethren..but he got lost along the way..characters appear and disappear (Buster)without adding anything to the story and/or plot.The ending was ludicrous, at best..actually so was the book...the moral being power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely (gee, what a surprise!)In a word, this book was stupid...and well below the expectations of this once terrific writer! Mr. Grisham..get back to your roots and write a compelling book, please."
2,"Ok, definitely not the best","This book seemed to show the author to be very pressured in writing it. His books are usually exceptional and exciting, however, this one was choppy and seemed to go nowhere. It could have been much more dramatic as all of his other ones are, but it was more of a bunch of brainstorming ideas bunched together without any real form. Not my favorite, but I haven't lost my love for Grisham's books yet, and look forward to upcoming ones."
2,Get thee to a library and farewell!,"Fatal attraction meets the presidency (with a twist). Characters were shallow. Plot development and resolution seemed too forced and the ending, as has been of late with these novels, less than believable. Reminded me a bit of the infamous Freshman 500-word composition: fill up so many pages and then stop. Borrow it from the library (sorry Amazon!)"
1,the brethren,"I am a great fan of John Grisham. However, this book was a huge disappointment. I can't believe he wrote it. I gave up after the first 80 pages, it was so boring."
1,"Bestseller, my foot!","I've read every one of Grisham's books and this one was a great disappointment. Totally ungripping, I nevertheless forced myself to read the whole thing. And got disappointed in the end too. Avoid this - if you want to read Grisham, start with Chamber and then move chronologically forward."
3,Not one of Grisham's best,"I would not recommend this book as someone's first reading by Grisham. It was a good book, but not one of his best. It was about 100 pages too long and didn't really have much of a plot. The only reason I kept reading it was because of the conspiracy and wanted to see if the guy was caught writing letters to Ricky :)"
3,Not what I expected!,"This book is not on par with Grisham's usual flair. I keptwaiting to get to the good part. He would almost take me there andthen drop me like a hot potatoe. I knew what was going to happen before it happened. There was no real excitment. I want the supense of ""The Pelican Brief"" and the drama of ""A Time to Kill"" back."
3,Average Book,"This book had the typical intelligent writing style of John Grisham with a below average to poor ending. I'm glad that I bought and read it, but I'm disappointed with the conclusion or lack thereof."
1,Emperors new clothes,"Where's the plot? Nothing happened. It starts with a fine premise, a group of wiley old judges, v. an evil CIA chief. But there is no battle of wits. Give us some real action. If Grisham's next book also gets bad review, I'll just take the critics word for it."
3,Ingenious,"Although it was easier to put down than some of his previous works, the Brethren once again manifests the author's indefatigable plotting skills.It was very timely, also, with the upcoming US election. The plot was dissected into 2 ""scenes"", whilst worlds apart, were inextricably linked by the ""trolling of bait"" in a top shelf magazine which was ""bitten"" by a presidential candidate.The Author's experience as counsel has paid off once again, as he shows the links between scheming lawyers (or in this case judges) and the electoral process."
2,A Major Disappointment,"The book started out okay then it started to get really interesting, but at the end it just stopped. No closure, no solving all the characters in the book. It seems like John Grisham got tired of writing the book and just ended it where he stopped! That's the only explanation I can think of. I felt like I wasted my time reading it. John what happened?"
2,Not Grisham's Best,"I found this book predictable and depressing. The synical outlook on presidential politics would have been forgiveable if there was a protagonist to like, or even to understand. There were so many characters that no one's motivation was explored in any depth. The premise was promising, it was just the execution that was dissappointing."
1,The Brethren,John Grisham must have thrown this book together while trying to come up with an idea for his next great book. Probably his weakest effort.
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I couldn't wait to purchase and read ""The Brethren""; however, I found the book to be an extremely difficult read, and it took me weeks to complete it. I usually find anything that JG writes to be extremely entertaining, but I am forced to lump this one in the same category as ""The Chamber,"" which I also found to be a difficult read.Maybe his next concoction will be better....?"
3,The Brethren,"While this is probably not the best of Grisham, it certainly held my interest. I liked the weaving of the story lines and how they played out together. I would recommend this for light reading pleasure."
1,Could have been better,"Being a John Grisham addict, I bought the Brethren with high expectations, considering the quality of his last novel, The Testament. However, I was very disappointed. When I finished it, I was asking many questions that had gone unanswered. The end was a big let-down, possibly the worst part of the story. Grisham had a great idea going with the 2 sub-plots, but it just didn't deliver like I was hoping. For those of you who aren't familiar with his work, don't start with this one. Maybe his next will be better."
1,Low budget T.V. movie,"Grishams latest reads like a bad t.v. movie. very thin, with very shallow characters. It is a quick read with an interesting premise. But as with his last few books the ending is boring and contrived. I have been a very big fan of grisham since ""The Firm"". I have everyone of his books in first edition hardcover. When the next one comes out I'll use the library before buying. It almost seems like he's trying to write simple screenplays instead of novels lately. Complete with the disney fairytale endings. Very disappointed!"
3,A great read with an average ending,"As a reader that had grown a bit tired of the Grisham-type legal novel, I have to say I am glad I read this one. The story line was great -- an easy read without a lot of technical stuff -- and it moved quickly. Though I felt the ending was a bit abrupt, I would still recommend this one over ""Rainmaker"" or ""The Chamber"" anyday. There isn't really a ""good guy"" to pull for, but at least the story is interesting enough to keep you curious."
1,Turned off Grisham,"My husband and I have both previously awaited the release of a Grisham novel. While disappointed with The Testament, we still decided to give The Brethern a try. What a mistake. I can't think of a book that I've read recently that I have liked less. No more Grisham buyers in this household."
1,Save your money...,I am a big Grisham fan but this one was not worth the read. I read the book on a plane and hurried to finish it before the flight ended. I wonder if he did the same when he wrote it...
1,"This one needs a ""Street Lawyer"" to get it out of trouble","I have loved every John Grisham book that I've read until this one. ""The Street Lawyer"" and ""The Chamber"" are my favorites. This one needs a street lawyer to get it out of trouble. This one is indeed out on the streets and it needs help. There are no memorable characters in it and the writing itself did not hold my interest. I had to force myself to keep reading.I almost gave up several times. If you only read one John Grisham book, this is not it. Try ""The Street Lawyer"" or ""The Chamber""."
2,Boring,"The 700+ customer reviews cannot go completely wrong: This book, ""The Brethren"" by John Grisham, is disappointingly boring. And it could have been so interesting.The CIA gets a conspiration going to install congressman Aaron Lake as the upcoming President of the United States. You can see the influence of money and company interests, the manipulation of the people by media etc. However, the story is not really worked out, details are missing, and actually, this seems not to be the main story the book wants to tell. The ""main story"" is the description of an extortion scheme used by three former judges, who are imprisoned in a federal jail, and their lawyer. The story is dragging, the writing is neither fast-paced nor rich in detail. And even when the two main streams of action touch you are longing for the end of the chapter to finally go to sleep..."
2,Mediocre effort by a good author,"I have read all of John Grisham's books, and this is the first one that I truly hated. The character development left a lot to be desired. The plot, while interesting in the beginning took some good twists and turns but leaves the reader flat in the end. In all honesty, if you are looking for a Grisham book, try The Testament, or The Firm. These are much better."
2,boring,"When I read The Firm and A Time To Kill I thought I had discovered a treasure. As a southern lawyer, I adored the books. All of the rest of his books have been sort of uneven..a flash of the old brillance here and there but ultimately unsatisfying. This one reads as if he dashed it off over a weekend. No real passion. John, PLEASE! Write something with passion..."
2,Movie of the Week,"Grisham's once crafty legal thrillers are fast becoming movie of the week material. Entertainig enough to watch, but you wouldn't recommend it to a friend or ever mention that you watched it. He's churning out these stories faster than you can microwave popcorn. Grisham's novels usually end with a good deal of closure and the bad guys getting theirs. In The Brethren, everyone walks away with more than what they started with. You're not really sure who to cheer for either. I agree with one reviewer that it appears that a chapter or two might be missing from the end. I finished this book saying ""I smell a sequal"", although that may have been the popcorn."
1,What happened?,Like many others I looked forward to The Brethren. I've read all of John Grisham's books and enjoyed every one. This was a big disappointment. The story bored me and I couldn't connect to the characters. I didn't find it suspensful--I knew immediately what was going to happen at the end -- and I was right.
1,"Read ""The Pelican Brief"" instead","I have read and enjoyed other Grisham novels (e.g., The Pelican Brief), but I didn't think much of this one. Most of the characters are seedy and all are unsympathetic, the link between the two subplots can be spotted a mile off, and the political elements are laughably unrealistic (what one-term governor defeated for re-election would ever dare to run for president? what government agency would be disciplined enough to fund a leak-free presidential campaign?). A book without a hero can be redeemed by wit or gritty realism, but this one has neither."
2,Not a good pick,"This is the third Grisham novel that I have read, The Summons and Painted House being the first 2. I was extremely disapponted with this book. I waited and waited till the last page for some big ending or surprise, but it never came. While I have to admit that the book did keep me somewhat hooked, I finished the book very disappointed and wondering if I had missed something."
2,Worst since Street Lawyer,"As a Grisham fan, I was disappointed in this book. There was no true protagonist to get behind and none of the characters were very likable or interesting. The plot was extremely limited and the ending was the most anticlimactic of his entire collection. Let's hope Grisham's venture outside the legal thriller with A Painted House can rejuvenate this great author."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad","I wish I had read the reviews for this book. I'm a Grisham fan, but this was his worse by far. Easy reading, but totally unbelievable plot. Thank God I used a gift cerftificate. My sister-in-law should be refunder the 7 bucks. Shame on you Grisham."
4,Finally: Grisham recovers from deep slump!,"I was hooked on Grisham books from the time of The Firm, but the last few years have been tough: his books have shown all the telltale signs of an author who tries to write more than he can handle (not that poor John is alone in that respect). But here, finally, the slump ends: I enjoyed The Brethren, with its two plots weaved together, very much. Not that there is any doubt where the story is going, if the reading had been a bit more unpredictable it would have been even better. The characters are, as usual, a bit sterotype but enjoyable company nevertheless.If you have never read a book by John Grisham, try ""A Time to Kill"", ""The Firm"", and ""The Runaway Jury"" first, though. Avoid ""The Partner"" and ""The Testament""."
3,Not one of his best....,"but still a good, quick read. Good beach or travel material. Not the typical page-turner, finish in the wee morning hours that Grisham has written before. Interesting story line, but I think that I expected more.His other books, while being a sit-on-the-edge-of-your-chair novels, seemed to be at least a little believable and highly suspenseful. I don't know if I just didn't click with the characters in The Brethren, but I just wasn't as interested in finishing this book as some of his others."
1,Boring,"I had given up on John Grisham a long time ago and looking at his body of work, I can clearly see when I stopped reading and why. I loved Time to Kill and The Firm, but gave up when his writing became formulaic. Someone recommended The Brethren and I decided to give him another try. I was disappointed....the story is engaging at first, but simply falls flat. The characters are one dimensional and you just do not even care what happens to them. Put this one back on the shelf. Maybe if we are lucky, Grisham will go back to his roots soon."
2,Disappointing,"Not exactly the ""on the edge of your seat"" story that I've come to expect from Grisham. It was somewhat engaging because I love John Grisham, however, it's not one that I would recommend. In fact, today, I can't even remember how it ended."
4,Good plot Fair ending,"It look like the most problems for Grisham's novel is the ending. I alway upset about the ending of his novels. It seem like he's too tire to think what the ending should be. It just suddenly end, you know. Like he think ""oh I want it to end right now I've use so much time to write it Now I need a long vacation"" But I've to accept that the plot of most of his novels are still the best. And that is the big reason why I like his book and ready to pay for every book that wrote by John Grisham."
1,As an English teacher...,"After reading, and loving, the other Grisham books, I eagerly anticipated the paperback release of The Brethern. Although I did finish it, I was incredibly disappointed in it. There was not enough of a balance between the main characters, and Teddy had more power than any other man I believe (or would like to believe) that a man could have. The ending was incredibly unsatisfying as well.When I put this book on my shelf, I knew it would be sitting there for a long time before I would take it off again."
4,A great book with a disappointing ending,"This book had me intrigued from the very beginning. The way the plot kept building made me not want to put the book down. I savored every page until the end, when I was left with a feeling of ""That's it?"" The novel leaves the reader with no sense of resolve or closure, like Grisham's other novels do. Overall, the book was wonderful, but readers should be expecting a disappointment when the reach the last page."
2,A BIG Disappointment,"This is the 7th Grisham book that I have read. I looked so forward to reading this and was gravely disappointed in it. Grisham's books are usually very easy to read and understand, but the plot in this book, was quite confusing, although it did straighten up towards the end. I found that I had to read at least 160 pages before I was somewhat interested in it. The idea of the book was good but it was confusing. It was also chopped off at the end and more information could have been given. I won't give up on Grisham. Maybe next time it will be better."
3,my review,"I enjoyed reading this book.I find that this time, John Grisham made a change in his usual plots: instead of using a lawyer as the main character, he uses three judges who have found themselves to be in the opposite side of the law. This makes an interesting reading.As usual, the author's description of characters is real and has you guessing the outcome until the very end!"
4,GOOD BUT CHANGE THE ENDING,"I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS A GOOD READ, VERY TOPICAL WITH SUPER TUESDAY ETC, BUT THE ENDING COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER"
1,Boring!,I finished this book because I was 9 months pregnant and had nothing better to do. This is his worst yet!
1,The Brethren,"This book was pricey, pithy and pitiful. Let this be as low as Mr. Grisham gets otherwise he will loose his readership. The book was slow, the plots were weak and the read was painful. Sorry Mr. Grisham, if this is the vein you are taking, I will not pay the price."
1,ZZZZZZZ....,"Sorry John, the book is boring. I really tried to get through it, but it's just a slow, slow read. Characters are dull and there isn't any suspense. Hope your next one is better."
2,Where's the ending?,"Much like all the other Grisham books I have read, this one was a page turner, but it had no ending! The idea was great, but Grisham should have continued the book for another 300 pages. He left many questions unanswered and failed to develop characters in the way that he did in his earlier novels, i.e. A Time to Kill. I wouldn't recommended it to die hard Grisham fans. They will be disappointed."
3,"C'mon John, you can do better....","Very interesting premise and of course this book is a page turner. Grisham is a good story-teller.The first half of the book is better than the second. I get the feeling Grisham didn't know how to end the story, was in a time crunch or didn't put a lot of thought into it. Also, I didn't really side with any of the undeveloped character(s). If a character died, disappeared, lucked out or succeeded, I didn't really care."
2,This is not up to Grisham's standard.,"John, good concept, but the characters were not developed. Besides, the book just ended - you needed to tie up the lose ends. This is not the quality of The Firm or A Time to Kill."
2,Brethren,Compared to other books by Grisham this one was really flat. It lacked character and plot development. The book never developed the story line to a level of enjoyment. I think this is a case of huge marketing excitement with a marginal product..
2,Disappointed,"Having read every Grisham title to date, the Brethren was the only disappointment so far. The plot was ingenious but there were many ""holes"" in the story, unlike his former novels. It almost seems as if fragments of different books were pieced together. And the ending, well, John you know better. Frankly, the ending stunk. Since I sincerely enjoyed the other books, Mr. Grisham gets another chance. Better luck next time."
2,mixed emotions,"The book itself was good. Grisham has a great story in this one, but I feal that he left the suspense and the ending out. The book was a page turner because I waiting for something to happen, but nothing really happened. I was disapointed that none of the loose ends were tied up in the end. Grisham needs to read this review and rewrite this book with less junk and more suspense."
2,Grisham cranks 'em out,"With each book John Grisham writes it seems that the thought he put in earlier books such as A Time to Kill and the Pelican Brief, just isn't there. This reader experienced none of the legal excitement of his earlier novels. It seems that Grisham is falling into the old trap of cranking out the books and trading quantity for quality."
2,Yawn!,"Mr. Grisham disappointed me this time. The Brethern seemed to be written hurriedly. No real hero and only a sort of villan. Just was not the Grisham page turner that he normally writes. Come John, give us a good one. {I usually read his books in two days.. this took me a week and a half to plow through!"
1,So unpleasant i couldn't finish it,"A bunch of convicted criminals, in prison, organize a racket to blackmail people out there. The costs of the operations are borne by the tax payers. The story was so unpleasant i couldn't finish it. (Does a prison HAVE to be as nice as a motel?)"
3,Lots of characters but none to root for!!,"I wouldn't say that this is classic Grisham. It lacks a lot of the soul and passion you can expect from his characters. Also, the atmosphere was never really a character like a lot of his books based in the South. The plot was very involved and thought out. So much so, that I wasn't sure the plot points were going to converge well at the beginning. However, they did pretty well. Overall, a decent read but not thrilling!"
1,A WASTE OF TIME,"As a devoted Grisham fan, I anxiously anticipate an exciting new novel from the master of political intrigue every Februaury. His latest, The Brethren fell so short of my expectations, that I am honestly considering returning it for a refund. It was such an unintereseting premise to begin with, that I can't help but wish that Mr. Grisham re-think his current schedule of writing. Perhaps if he concentrated on developing the story, instead of trying vainly to meet his editor's schedule each year, we his fans might finally get a wonderfully, thrilling novel that he is more than capable of giving."
2,fast read,"Oh it's a fast read, because there is not much to this ""Grisham-pump-it-out-fast-for-the-bucks"" book. Weak character development, weak plot lines & a hurried ending make for a poor read. The timing of the political primaries was an editorial coup. Too bad they did not take as much time as our Government does, to plot this out. Shame shame John, why don't you write about baseball? I am sure you could kill off at least 1 attorney in that scenario too."
1,The Brethren,What a total let down. After finishing the book I gave it away. The book focused to much on money. Aaron Lake and the CIA would have been a better way to go. The judges were just down right boring.
2,Why?,This is not a suspense filled wonder as his earlier books have been. Do not buy this book unless you want something to help you fall asleep.
1,THE BRETHREN,I HAVE READ ALL OF GRISHAM'S BOOKS & THIS ONE IS THE WORST ONE THAT I HAVE READ. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE-I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT HE WROTE SUCH A LOUSY BOOK-WAS HE IN A HURRY?FOR ONCE I AGREE WITH THE CRITICS.I HOPE THAT THEY DO NOT MAKE A MOVIE OUT OF THIS BOOK. IF THEY DO-I HOPE THAT IT IS BETTER THAN THE BOOK. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN GRISHAM-HE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS.
1,"Bad, boring and unbelievable!",I am in agreement with the many others who have reviewed this book. Don't waste your time or money.
1,Don't Bother with this one,"If you are a true John Grisham fan, don't read this book. It was so disappointing that I'm not sure I will buy his next one the first week it hits the stores like I usually do. It had no plot, not much of a story line and the ending tied nothing together. Don't waste your time."
4,Interesting plot,"The book is well written, looks like two story lines that are tied together extremely well. The two premises are very interesting. Three imprisoned judges pulling off for them what appears to be a safe blackmail scheme. And the CIA buying the Next predident of The USA. A book with no romance in it, and thank God. For this book is funny and easy to read. Buy it; you will not be sorry. Much better than his last couple that were released."
1,This book doesn't cut.,"I am a John Grisham fan but this book is really disappointing. The writing style is superb of course but the plot, the story itself, is very predictable. After putting the book down, you want to ask, so what?From the first 100 pages you already know that the 3 judges will hook the Presidential candidate Aaron Lake. Where is the punch in the story? It doesn't deliver...."
3,Ridiculous Plot,"This was well acted and well produced but I just cannot imagine a mother welcoming her husband home after he molested their daughter. I don't understand why they made a movie about this. Abusers don't change, it is not a disease you can recover from. It is an impulse that they cannot control."
2,Aftermath - 2003,"This 2003 made-for-TV film stars Meredith Baxter, Robert Urich and Shawna Waldron. It is a film about incest and the devestating effects it has upon all parties involved.Mom Carol (Baxter) and daughter Tess (Waldron) must deal with Dad (Ulrich) as he comes to terms with his molestation of Tess - Unfortuately the film misses the mark and does not portray a realistic scenario of the relationship between all the parties involved. In spite of the fact that both parents were abused as children it is difficult to relate to them as adults. Carol's mother (Diane Ladd) does little to help the situation. Written for Lifetime TV, and in spite of the powerful subject matter and the actors doing the best they could with the weak script, this film is not worth watching."
5,shame on the mothefr,Great movie - held your interest - but disgusting that the mother of a molested daughter would welcome her husband back home because the selfish ----- doesn't want to be alone. She even wanted to blame her daughter and held it against her for allowing this to happen. Wonderful acting but very disturbing that this kind of thing is going on too often and most of the mother's are to blame in one way or another.
1,total disaster,"Product was shipped by DSL. Arrived 2 days later at DSL facility five mile from my home. After four days I still hadn't received. Checked with Amazon and was told I could pick up on Friday or DSL would deliver Monday. Didn't receive Monday and after tracing was told, customer refused shipment. Since I was home all day and DSL didn't show up I again contacted Amazon and DSL and was told item arrived broken at DSL and had been returned to Amazon the previous week. Order was cancelled and bought a better Am. Standard toilet at Home depot for a better price. Moral of story, ""Don't believe what DSL tells you."""
4,"a fantastic score, very industrial and for hard core fans!","This is a great game score done by the master. I would reccommend it more to die hard fans ( I listen to it all the time!) But not so much to people who may have just seen the movie. It is very industrial, with all of the sounds that are featured in the game.If u want more haunting music, I reccommend the scores from SH 2 and 4."
5,An eye opening experience,"This film is truly one that will go down in history in terms of changing public opinion. Showing the true barbaric nature of people who are motivated by greed was a real shocker. We as a global society know that we are overusing the resources that we have and destroying most of everything that has been around long before us and yet we just ""keep on truckin"" (for lack of a better term). What people need to realize is that everything on this planet coexists in a delicate balance that needs to stay in check and the deplorable killing of 90% of the shark population is part of that balance that isn't in check. Rob Stewart has taken his passion to a level that will truly make a difference and I thank him for that. Never doubt that a small group of people can change the world; because that's all that ever has! Watch this film, take a stand and educate the people around you. Who knows, maybe we'll change the world."
5,Inspirational!,"Such a great documentary about sharks and their roles in the world! If we don't do something, then we are not doing the right things! Go sharks!!!"
4,Sharkwater doesn't bite,This movie is along the same lines as The Cove. If you've seen The Cove and liked it you'll like this one as well. If you haven't seen The Cove I would reccomend seeing that one first. The only reason I only gave Sharkwater 4 stars is because the narration can be a bit mono tone and can be boring at times. Still Rob Stewart is passionate about Sharks and it shows through out the movie. The photography is beautiful. Well worth the price. Give ot a go.
5,Very educational and very moving,"This documentary has some of the most dramatic and emotional footage I have seen. This movie will educate, change minds and motivate the crowds that watch it. ""Sharkwater"" takes you through 90 min. of beautiful shark ecosystems as well as introduces the audience to the gruesome effects that humans have on shark populations. This film will break many disclosures that people may have on sharks. It also shows how many people completely lack the knowledge of sharks in general. I can only hope that more people take interest in this film so that the world can become a little more educated on the importance of sharks and our oceans."
5,Worldwide Eco-Crime exposed with heartfelt passion,"Beautiful in it's cinematography, this film exposes a true-to-life story under Robs very lens. It documents one of mankinds most heinous crimes against our oceans - the ruthless and barbaric practice of ""finning"" sharks to supply fins for Shark Fin Soup.Unable to swim, the live finless bodies are often kicked back into the sea. Even if you don't like sharks, or know about their value to the planet, you will be moved by the evidence in this film - and at least made more aware of the problem that has now decimated some 90% of the sharks on this planet."
4,Gets the idea across,This documentary gets the idea across that simple stupidity is still the major cause of environmental degradation on this planet. Sharks are magnificent but are being hunted to extinction worldwide to feed the Asian superstition industry. Come on people. Pull your heads out of your rear ends.I bought a copy and circulated it with my friends at work who don't get out as much.
3,Beware Blu-Ray disc is 1080/60i,"The data for the feature film on the Blu-Ray disc seems to be encoded as 1080/60i, not 1080p as described. I have several feature films on Blu-Ray and they all play at 1080/24p according to my display (Sony VPL-VW60) but this disc, like some other documentaries, plays back at 1080/60i. The packaging indicates its 1080p, I assumed 1080/24p but it's not. It's an MPEG-2 encoded 1080/60i feature and while the film is excellent, the video quality is sub-par for a blu-ray release. It still looks better than a normal DVD, but not by a lot."
5,Great film for people who care about the planet,"I highly recommend Sharkwater to everyone who cares about the type of world our children and grandchildren will inherit from us. Sharkwater combines compelling drama with essential facts about sharks, including their critical role in safeguarding the health of the oceans and the planet. As this film so adeptly conveys, if our species continues our inexcusable, violent, and relentless attack on sharks, we will destroy ourselves and the planet right along with them."
2,A big dissapointment,"My daughter had great expectations for this when she received it as a gift but she had received disappointment after disappointment. It is not ""the robotic puppy that acts just like a real puppy.""It is nothing like a real puppy, in fact. I won't respond to any name but Tekno, its expressions are very hard to interpret (does a real puppy have eyes that change from red to blue?), the touch sensors are hard and ""petting"" the robot is not satisfying, it doesn't come or fetch (you have to give it the ball). It can't sit, roll over, or do any tricks of merit. And it is ugly and hard.It is in my daughter's closet waiting for the appropriate amount of time before we give it away."
5,"Very, Very Good Book","One of the most useful books for rigging bait and tackle I have ever found. I would suggest buying a later dated version, though I purchased an older version just to read and compare, it was still very informative and pretty much like the newer versions. Rigging bait and tackle hasn't changed much in decades, perhaps centuries for some of it, but equipment has improved over the years such as the materials used. If you like fishing, either salt or freshwater, I give this book my highest recommendation."
2,Boring,"My 4 year old, who liked the other preschool prep dvds (letters, numbers, etc.) was quickly bored with the blends dvd. The animations are monatonous and unclear. For example it shows a ""pr"" that is prying open a box for a lengthy period of time but never actually says the word pry. I was expecting a ""y"" to pop out of the box and have it form the word along with the pronunciation, but instead there were just gift boxes. When preschool children don't understand they lose interest."
5,Meet The Phonics blends,I found this whole series very helpful in teaching phonics to my preschooler and kindergarten children. I tutor preschool (Pre-k thru 3 graders) this is a helpful tool.
1,Good for before three years of age,"We should have gotten this before our kiddo was three. There is not enough action to hold a three year old's attention. In addition, as an educator, I sadly agree with the dad below who states that it is not ok that they add an ""a"" sound to the end of each blend. It's incorrect on the video's part. Pl=""pul"" not ""pla""."
2,hate the dragging vowel sounds,"first of all, let me just say that I'm a huge fan of this series and i own them all. 'meet the letters' taught my son his ABC's by 14months. but this particular DVD i find hard to watch and debate whether i will continue to show it to my sons. most of the blends are pronounced with an 'a' sound at the end where there is none. they explain their decision, but i disagree with their choice and it completely ruins the DVD for me. if you don't care that PL is pronounced 'PLA' instead of 'PUL' then the rest is fine. but 'please' is not pronounced 'plaease'"

1,Don't buy this book if your child has short hair!,I checked this book at the library and was so glad I didn't buy it. It had some really cute hairstyles but all the hair styles featured children with way past shoulder length hair. All the tips she gave were basic and stuff I already knew. She completely skipped toddlers. She had a small section on how to take care of babies hair and then jumped to pictures of older children with relaxed long hair. She had a small section for locked hair no section on nature hair and an area on how to relax your childs hair if her hair too nappy to comb. My daugher is only three. I was looking for tips to keep her hair healthy and to help it grow. She had one picture of a little girl with short braided hair and everyone else with hair down their back which is something most toddlers have yet.
2,Not all Good...,"The pictures in this book are not very helpful when trying to recreate the styles. I purchased this book in order to gain ideas for hairstyles for my little ones. This book does contain pics of different styles, but it will only show the hairstyle from one angle. It may show a picture from either the front, side or back, but not from all three angles. If you just want to read a few stories about kids experiences with their hair, then purchase this book. If you are looking for pictures of hairstyles, consider yourself warned."
4,Helpful but limited,"As a father with a 10-month old girl, this book was helpful for understanding basic hair care as well as offering some simple styles. If it had more information on braiding, it would be even more helpful as my daughter's hair is growing quickly and I am not completely familiar with braiding styles and options.The inclusion of the ""old wives' tales"" is a great feature that points out some myths about AA hair care. My mother-in-law read the book and laughed about all the ""myths"" recalling her own experience with her grandmother, etc., and then told me braid the baby's hair because ""it will grow faster.""This was a good book to get me started but next I will buy something with more explanations styles and how-to for braiding."
4,Good Guide Book,"I purchased this book for ideas on how to style my 4-yr. old daughter's hair. I has a few ideas, but the book is really for someone who does not know the first thing about grooming black hair. It is a good, guide book that takes you from infancy through the pre-teen years.Reading the book with your toddler helps her to appreciate her hair type, and she can also select styles that she may want you to try on her.My biggest disappointment was that there were not enough pictures of different styles and how to do them."
2,Not really a Guide as title implies,I didn't find this book very helpful. The actual directions for hair styling was over simplified and the pictures were lacking. I didn't learn anything new by reading this and it read as more of a motivational guide to encourage your daughter to be proud of her hair. Although that was lacking as well because I would have like a little more history on the hair styles.
3,Somewhat helpful,"I am a white woman with an adopted African American daughter. I'm still trying to learn how to do this hair after eight years.This book explained a few children's hairstyles that I will try, but there were some questions that were still left unanswered - like, what do I do with the hair during bedtime? And am I supposed to put oil/moisturizer in her hair everyday or not?There also was not any explanation about what combs/brushes to use -she mentioned them, but I didn't know what they were.Overall it was okay, somewhat helpful, but I wouldn't buy it again."
5,Great Help for Transracial Adoptive Moms,"As a white Mom with an A-A daughter, I have a lot to learn about caring for her dry, kinky hair. I thought this book had some great tips about general hair care as well as styling. There are line-drawing illustrations to accompany photographs of the completed hairstyle. Most of all, I liked the supportive attitude of the author and the short essays from other Primary Care Givers (Black, White, and Biracial) about styling their daughter's hair. My daughter is 2, so many of the styles are not appropriate for her yet, but I have been able to incorporate aspects of the more complicated styles into her more simple daily 'do. You can read a more complete review and learn more about my adoption experience at my blog [...]"
3,"Great ideas, but not enough details.","As the mother of 3 bi-racial daughters I am always on the look out for tips on hair care. This book did help me with some styling ideas, but there were not enough details on products to use on the hair itself. With everything that lines the shelves of the beauty supply store, a mom's head could spin from all the choices. It would have helped if the book listed what products the models had used in their hair."
4,Great Hair Book!,"I really like this book because the author made it easy to understand page by page of how to make beautiful hairstyles for my both of my daughters. They have even re-created some of the hairstyles themselves if I'm not around. I have enjoyed this book soo much, that I bought another one for my best friend for her young daughter as well. The only thing missing was the color pages. But this book is for thoses Mothers out there who want their Daughter and Son to look there best without a lot of time and cost!"
3,"Good, but our kids aren't toys","I got this book because my niece wanted cornrows and I am a DIY kind of uncle. I was impressed with the instructions and illustrations. My niece was thrilled with the results and looked adorable.My problem with the book is that some of the styles are a little over the top. I wish the book would stick to traditional African styles. Some of these ""do's"" make the kids look like christmas trees or Chia pets. How are we going to get these kids to learn self-respect when we make them look so silly!So, I recommend the book for rows, braids and such. But please parents (and Uncles and Aunties), keep it pure and keep it African!"
2,Grated Plastic!,"I bought this grater following the testing on America's Test Kitchen. This must be a different model because it is not all I had hoped.For a start, I find the handle wobbly, it can twist when pressing down on a larger piece of cheese. Also, the handle where it meets the drum hits the drum when grating, actually shredding plastic into the cheese. Fortunately, as the grater is black, I was able to see (and hear) it and stop. Finally, I had to shave off part of the grater so stop this from happening.It grates well and the drums are easy to change and clean.I just wish it were more robust and that the pieces aligned better. I would not buy this again or recommend it to others."
3,redundant,"Each track with the exception of "" Come and get your love "" -the truest sound on the c.d. seems to have the same rhymth lead-in. While I remember Pat & Lolly Vega from their Sunset Strip days in L.A. , I was expecting more. Felt as if I was listening to the same song over and over again. They are too good to have done this to themselves. Now I had not heard them in years and was pleased to hear so many years later that they had become Redbone so searched the web to buy the new sound. Great idea, bad music with the exception of those in Europe that think this is true American Indian music. The same intro to each song does not make it a worthwhile cd. Old memories, perhaps they forgot what they were capable of."
4,tight collection,"always dug this band and of course ""come and get your Love"" was my jam from the word jump. always grooved hard to that cut and still do. very versatile and overlooked band. must have set here and enjoy the collection."
5,Original REDBONE,This is a great CD - a talented band that got popular despite Mainstream music which has over looked and ignored MANY talanted NATIVE artits and groups from country to hip hop. Via REBONE!!! the original...
4,Computers don't know everything...,"I got this album by mistake. I was trying to complete my collection of Leon Redbone and Amazon mistakenly lumped this work in with his list. I thought "" Cool, a Redbone album I don't have."" I was right, and wrong. Still, it's a very enjoyable piece of work and since I had actually seen this group in concert in San Bernardino, CA in the early seventies I was more than happy with my mistaken purchase."
4,Very appealing toy,"This toy is a favorite of my 10 month old. He likes the crinckle fin and the mirror. He also loves the music, which calms him down when he is crying. The music is soothing and doesn't grate on our nerves even though we've heard it many times.My only complaints are that there are just two short tunes that play alternatively and you have to press his belly fairly hard each time you want one to play. It would be nice if there was a setting to have them play a few or more times. There are pictures with words on one fin that are useless and there to fit the Einstein theme.All in all, a good product that I would buy again.By the way, the thing he is wearing on his head is a diving mask and a snorkle."
3,6 mo daughter likes but not in love,"My 6 mo daughter likes but is not in love with her Neptune activity toy. I bought it because I thought it looked like she would be interested in playing with it a lot before becoming board of it. ALthough she will play with it ... shortly after is completly over it and moves on to something else. As a side note it also kinda heavuy in the center where the battery compartment and water filled tummy of it is. Positive... the music it plays is great, it has a few different tunes and is not annyoing."
2,Safety Issue,"I am the parent of twin boys who have enjoyed Baby Einstein's fun and educational DVDs and toys.As infants, the boys greatly enjoyed their Baby Einstein Neptune Activity Toy for a number of months. One day I noticed that the border around the mirror had started to separate from the mirror itself, causing an extremely sharp edge to be exposed. I immediately removed this toy from the boys' toy collection due to severe concern about the extremely sharp edges very badly cutting little fingers and/or mouths or lips.I am greatly disappointed in my experience with one of Baby Einstein's typically well-trusted toys for play, enjoyment, and educational purposes.I felt that it was very important to let other parents know about this safety concern regarding the toy. I might also emphasize that the toy was subjected to completely normal use, no type of abuse or misuse."
2,NOT A KIDS REVIEW:: Not worth it.,"This album is close to crap. ""CAMERA OBSCURA"" is just random sounds and singing. The only REALLY great Nico song on this CD is her version of ""My Funny Valentine"". Das Lied Vom Einsamen Madchen is just Nico singing in german over what seems like a very simple Pet Shop Boys beat but the Lyrics in english translation is typical and good Nico songwriting. I would rather buy Live In Tokyo, or any other album which is a better album than this."
5,same as the original equipment,"If you like the original small rubber sleeves, you will like these as they are the same thing!"
1,Decieving,"Unfortunately when looking for the fletching jig and feather clamp that is not what I recieved, to the layperson the photo makes this add deceptive, as pictured it shows the jigg and feather clamp, not just the feather clamp as was delivered. Yes this was partly my flat for not knowing more about the whole process of fletching before I bought it, but it was a gift for my son so I did not take the time to study. I sent it back for a refund minus mailing it to me and bake to the seller, and a ten percent restocking fee, I can't help feeling that this add was done this way on purpose.."
1,No.,"This is a poet who has no emotional or spiritual depth. He is poet of shame. His sarcasm and wit is anything but remarkable. I was actually looking foward to reading his poetry in my class, but was terribly disappointed. It's not worth it."
1,BROKEN WATCH ARRIVED... STILL TAKING MOS. TO RESOLVE,I received this watch with the entire closure clasp missing on the watchband and no way to close it and wear it... also the watch was not running and I guess I was supposed to pay another five dollars locally to have a battery put in it too...very very disappointed..returned it for credit to amazon.. and it is taking MONTHS to go thru their system and get credited so I can buy something else....I will think long and hard before I purchase items from amazon again that aren't books or music items...sigh !
2,Nice watch but bad battery,I've purchased this watch a month ago and although it's nice the battery died already. Very dissapointed...
2,Nothing about exercise,"I think there is some good advise in the book, but it fails to talk about the great benefits of exercise and I would highly recommend reading and following recommendations in ""Younger Next Year"". aka Roosterman"
5,GET THE BOOK!!,"My grandmother was taking about 26 different meds for all sorts of conditions, COPD, arthritis, diabetes, cholesterol, fibromylagia, etc. etc. I figured most of her symptoms were a result of over medication and side effects. I first got the book ""Best pills, Worst Pills"" to review her meds. I highly recommend it. Then I started getting books on nutrition and vitamin supplementation. This book by Pauling is the best I have read. After you read it, it will give you a better understanding of how to look at you health from a big picture point of view. The other book I highly recommend is a book by Hoffer called ""Putting it all together: The New Orthomolecular Medicine"". He writes more about his clinical experiences. If you read the Hoffer book first, you would probably be a little more skeptical, but if you read the Linus book first, it will give you a better foundation for accepting Hoffer's propositions. GET THE BOOKS!!"
5,Pauling changes perceptions,"Most people have the following perception of Vitamin C: ...""Well, vitamin C may be a nice, healthy supplement which, as such, may provide some minor protection against disease and help people be a little more fit. But it cannot cure or be of great value in treating severe intensive care diseases,.""... Pauling clearly explains in his book how and why this perception is WRONG... and with much reference to a large body of scientific evidence (lab, epidemiological, and clinical evidence) he convincingly demonstrates that vitamin C and other nutrients are MUCH more valuable than most people believe them to be."
2,Not effective for me,"I guess it is a hit or miss with this kind of things...For me it is a miss...Honestly, I have a hard time believing that repeating to me that I am feeling good, safe, beautiful or anything else is going to prove true...His voice is not specifically annoying or anything like that...I guess I am not suggestible enough for it to be effective with me."
4,soothing and relaxing,"This type of meditation helped me to feel peaceful.My first real work with meditating, I need some work relaxing, but it was a very good soothing voice with peaceful immages and easy to listen to."
4,Will bring down your stress levels,"Although I have not had an opportunity to listen but once, the CD was very relaxing. I love the voice (always very important when referring to a relaxation or hypnotic CD) of the author. I'm very happy with it and look forward to using it more often."
2,Incomplete Shipment & cracked/damaged shelves!,"While I like the easytrack system (have used in four other bedroom/hallway closets) and Amazon's supersaver shipping, this transaction was disappointing. Though I ordered qty 6 corner shelves about a month ago, I've only received 3 so far and some of the shelves were damaged/chipped in route to Alaska. I'm still waiting on the balance of 3 (and hope they show up in decent condition!)..."
4,"Heavy, solid, beautiful","I bought this and another similar, larger one in this same series, for a big dinner I was having for the neighbors. As a single girl who's lived in 7 places in the last 10 years (one outside the US) I just didn't have many serving items suitable for a dinner for 12 or so... It's called a ""mixing bowl"" but sure makes a fine serving bowl.I like the earthy yellow color, looks good with nice green veggies in it. Very heavy and substantial. Totally happy with it!"
5,Love it,I had seen this new ruby color in a specialty store locally and wanted it for Christmas dinnerware. I was happy to have found it on Amazon for less money and free shipping. You can't beat that. This Sorrento line of dinnerware is great.
4,INFO THAT NEVER GETS OLD,"THIS IS, AS ALL OF THE WINGS SERIES A WELL BUILT, INFORMATIVE HISTORY LEASON. IT GIVES THE AIRCRAFT AND ALL IT'S DETAILS IN A WAY THAT IS FUN AND INTRESTING, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PUTTING IT INTO PERSPECTIVE OF THE HISTORY TIME LINE AND TECH ADVANCEMENTS. IF YOU ARE INTO HISTORY AND OR AIRCRAFT IT IS ALMOST A MUST HAVE."
5,Nice Cables.,"I'm not a person who is devoted to having the best gold plated, shielded, uber expensive cables. These were very inexpensive and have a good quality feel to them. I gave up on spending silly amounts of money on good cables when I saw a high end Monster brand cable replaced with a bent metal clothes hanger and there was no loss in quality. The quality for the price on this cable would be hard to beat."
3,good sound bad connections,I dj through my computer into a mixer board and then through a peavey system we bout this cable and hate it it doesn't fit into the headphone jack on your computer correctly so you have to play with it to make i work or you loose a channel or the bass or something along them lines. When it dose transfer the sound they are good.
2,Nero Wolfe goes to Church,"Fred Durkin is arrested after a murder is committed in the Silver Spire, a church modeled after the Crystal Cathedral. Durkin was there due to Wolfe's refusal to handle a case involving threats to the leader of the Spire's congregation. Now due to Archie's guilt and Wolfe's sense of loyalty to one of his occasional operatives, he takes on the Spire's Circle of Faith to identify the murderer. This one is docked a star for having Wolfe leave the office for the weakest of reasons and confronting the suspects in the church offices. I would have preferred giving Durkin a little more to do considering it was his life on the line."
4,Gold is preferred to Silver,"This was the first of the Nero Wolfe books I have read. I was drawn to it as I enjoyed the TV series many years ago and was looking for a detective story book that I would enjoy. This book certainly met my expectations. The author certainly knew how evangelical minds worked at all levels in the world we are shown - some sincere, some not, but all with human strengths as well as failings. Archie's comments show us these as well as his responses to this world but it is Nero's insights that truly bring out the problems of having honeypots easily available to the weak minded. I would recommend this novel to those who like a good detective story that, while showing larger than life characters meeting unusual situations head on, deftly outlines the strengths and weaknesses which make us tick and sometimes fall into criminal ways."
5,Heart of the Hawk,I absolutely love Justine Dare's books. She has the knack of making you part of the book. If you love her books - she also used to write under the name of Justine Davis. I would definitely recommend any of her books!
3,An interesting love story.,"This book had an interesting love story (parts of it were hot!) but it simply was not as good as Fire Hawk. Of the trilogy, Fire Hawk is the best written. The heroine in this one was not as wonderful a character as Jenna (and at times was downright annoying). Also, some of the dialogue in Heart of the Hawk was so repetitious it made me long for the book to end."
5,Great Book,"I loved the first one so much, I bought the second and the third ones. I like how you can relate to the characters. They're very believable and funny. I recommend this book to anyone who's starting middle school :)"
5,A Book for Power Developers using VFP's powerful OOP...,"In order to benefit the Power of VFP, a developer should understand the power of OOP in software development. This book tells and guides you how OOP is applied in application development using VFP. The explanation of OOP tells it loud and clear that Object Orientation is very important aspect in today's software development. Markus and his associates really deserves commendation of doing it well."
4,"Bitter, mournful, haunting, tentative - just like life","A musical artist's life work should never be summed-up in one album, and especially one song, but if I had to pick that one song, it is ""Dying on the Vine"".For everyone who still has or remembers their mother, the taste of love gone wrong, and the sense of place askew, listen to Cale's weary voice singing lyrics for crying. ""Chinese Takeaway"" is as winsome as last year's history, and ""Satellite Walk"" is delightfully perverse. If Cale was not producing music in the 80s to suit the pandering critics, well, this was a good thing. Fans of John Cale's music should not avoid this album. Cale should be proud of the truth in this set of painful words and haunting melodies."
2,teaches unsavory behavior,"I was disappointed in this video. Although my twin daughters love it, I believe rainbow fish comes across as very mean-spirited and vain. Dazzle the Dinasaur has parts that are very scary and Dazzle and Mia are rewarded for disobeying their mother. This is not a lesson I want my girls to learn!"
4,Dazzle the dinosaur,"My son, who is three, did not care too much for ""The Rainbow Fish"", but loved ""Dazzle the dinosaur"". We watched it together many times, and now he wants me to tell him the story everyday. If your child is interested in dinosaurs, he/she would love to watch this movie. It is short enough to retain the child's attention span and simple enough for him/her to understand and remember."
4,Opened my eyes,"This story grabbed me and the writing kept its grip and opened my eyes to circumstances I would not have otherwise known. I felt as though I were really there, watching him pack meat, hanging with his friends, making it with his girl. I was frequently enlightened in areas about which I had been ignorant and I found myself worried one minute, anxious the next and often eager to help. This would be a good read for anyone and a gift that would be well received."
5,Addicting,This book was so good i couldnt put it down. i would recommend it to anyone who wants a great read
4,True stories!,"I bought this because one of the castles in this DVD is in our family heritage. My dad and I visited there. The head of the clan, who lives in the castle, said his dogs will suddenly look towards where the ghost is, and act like they ""see"" someone."
2,One of Laymon's little time-fillers.,"This doesn't even come close to being one of Laymon's best (or even memorable) works.A great idea: the female ""Queen"" of special f/x for horror movies is hounded by a desperate freak (who tries to make a name for himself by scaring the hell out of ""ordinary folk"") trying to break into the business and become her protege, while he in turn is being tracked down by a girl he played a cruel prank on in high school. Unfortunately, a great idea is all it is. The book is written in the most predictable and uninteresting way.This makes a time-filler, as it does have some trashy horror value, but that's about all; you really don't care what happens to the characters, and the ending is very disappointing. Laymon could do much better than this. Read one of his other books instead."
2,One to keep you going,"This is a fun little book (about 200 pages) that won't make you bored. Not a piece of literaly excellence but if your looking for a quick read and a page turner than this could be for you. The story is simple. There is a killer loose on the set of the lastest horror movie and our young female herione is the special effects artist and she suspect that the killer isn't really killing but is using special effect to make it look like it. She's right, and the killer is her biggest fan and if she dosen't watch out he just might start killing for real- on her!"
4,Not what I expected but great nonetheless...,"I really bought this book to do research for a film that I was writing... but it doesn't contain the dense mythological detail that I thought it would. It is however quite informative and well illustrated. All references are well cited.The sections about dragons are particularly interesting - details are well supplied.Don't expect expect a historical text based on mythological references, but this book is still a great read."
2,Dont buy,"When you pull your string back, the inside ring disappears and in low light you can't tell the difference between the yellow and clear. In the picture it looks like the yellow is really noticeable but in real life, it's not."
1,An amateurish effort,There is a definite lack of original material in this book. As I have almost all the pool books published in the last 20 years this new entry seems to offer slim pickings for any enthusiasts out there.But hopefully this is the authors' debut effort and the next edition will be far more complete. Also the graphics and diagrams can use a great amount of sprucing up.
4,Here's a suggestion:,"First let me mention that I myself own not only this book but also 50 other ""pool/billiard"" titles. (In other words: ""You name it, I own it."")The point of this post is not only to suggest that SOME of the other reviewers' remarks about this BEGINNER'S guide are unreasonably critical, but also to suggest that there's an easy, FREE way that you could decide for yourself whether this book is for you. JUST BORROW A COPY VIA YOUR PUBLIC LIBRARY (via ""interlibrary loan,"" if necessary). Then you'll know whether it would be worth your while to purchase a low-cost (perhaps ""used"") ""permanent"" copy for your bookshelf."
4,A good book for beginners,"I am posting this review under my real name, unlike some who choose to use a pseudonym.I purchased this book and found it entertaining. It is not intended to be a guide for the advanced pool player, but rather a primer for someone who knows very little about the game.For the record Francine Crimi is a certified ""Master Instructor"" and has worked very hard to achieve that status. She has been a pro player for many years and a respected teacher.If you enjoy watching the WPBA ladies on ESPN you should thank Ms. Crimi as she, along with others, worked tirelessly when this association was first formed to make it the success it is today.Sincerely,The real Wally Phillips"
3,Face Mask,"The mask was a bit small for my face and leaked a bit more than it should. Quality of the mask appeared to be good, will give to wife or kids with smaller face and see how works?"
3,good book,"this book is for us to take on our travels as a reference, so the fact that it was not packed well and received damage to the cover doesn't really matter. but it is a shame to be so sloppy."
3,Cartoons of historical cats,"I dearly loved _The Cat Who Went to Paris_, so I was delighted to learn that Gethers had co-authored _Historical Cats_ with his feline companion, Norton. (If you haven't heard of Norton, order that book *now* - you don't know what you've been missing.)Norman Stiles, the human co-author, appears in _The Cat Who Went to Paris_ as ""the Mayor of Fire Island"" - an old friend of Gethers who at that time was chief writer for _Sesame Street_.I had expected a book of essays or short stories about great cats of history, told from Norton's viewpoint. If you're looking for that book, too, this isn't it.Norton has kindly provided an entertaining prologue. The rest of the book is comprised of 1-page cartoons, one for each historical cat. The cartoon of Julius Caesar's cat that graces the cover of this edition is a typical sample."
4,Rock Solid Lessons,"Very good training guide. Felt like I was actually taking a class. Clear, concise exercises. Loved the confidence checks."
2,Very flashy,"The headphone has some good quality sound output but with this price tag, the material should be of a decent quality...mine broke with a minimal careful use with in a year...."
2,"Poor physical quality, but good sound","After having these headphones for about a year, yesterday they broke when I simply took them off my head! I only use them for gaming at home. They do sound good, but for the price of these headphones, they should be made of better material. Do a google search and you'll find others who's headphones have also broke. I'll never buy another pair of Bose headphones again."
4,Please Read This,"These headphones are being portrayed as easily damaged and broken, dont listen to tose portrayls of this item. i just went on a 3 week trip to Europe and i brought these headphones. i used them 3 or 4 hours each day, and left them around my little cousins who used them alos and they are still in perfect shape. they arent the most durable, but if not totally abused, they will hold up fine."
3,"veiled, muddy low end","I've compared this side-by-side with a Sony MDR-V700DJ that sells for the same price. The Sony beats this Triport by a mile or two!! Compared with the V700, the Triport sounds very veiled, like you have a towel wrapped between your ears and the headphones. The bass is sloppy and also, this headphone is not noise-cancelling! (contrary to previous reviewers).You'd be better off buying a Grado SR60 or SR125."
1,Imation sucks,"Buyers beware! Don¡t buy any Imation DVD media. On Imation¡s website they claim the media is capable of writing speed of 4X but it is all lies. I have the latest Pioneer A06 4x dual format recorder and this sucker only burns at 1X and makes lots of coaster (15% failure rate). I strongly recommend the Memorex. Not only it burns blazingly fast at 4X but costs about the same. As a side note, the Memorex disc is completed flat on the surface thus makes labeling much easier and appears much more professional when comparing to the Imation with a raised ring at the center."
2,Bad Towards End Of Disc,"I bought 2 of these, and had problems with almost all of them. In the last 20% of each disc, I couldn't write anything that didn't have errors.I used a lite-on 401s.The media code was CMC MAG R01. I've read nothing good about this media code."
4,"Terrific commentary, but a bit expensive","Prof. Simon's new commentary on Jonah contains the complete Hebrew text, the JPS's new English translation, and an extensive original commentary that illuminates the text like a 1000 watt searchlight. On average, each four or five lines of text gets a full page of explanation and commentary, so every subject gets covered in detail.He makes use of traditional rabbinic commentaries, and the Mishna, Midrash and Talmud. But it doesn't end here: The commentary goes on to make good use of literary analysis and comparative Semitics; intertextual commentary relating each book to other biblical books, and evidence from modern archaeological, discoveries."
4,Incredible show! Great quality as well,"I was at this show and it was one of the best performances i've ever seen, buckethead is insane and sounds great with the other members. Only reason i rated this 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because not all of the songs from the show are on this album. There was a very long and involved version of ""Maggot Brain"" with a violinist rocking out (with heavy distortion on the violin) which i would've liked to see on this release, but nonetheless, sick!!"
3,Not complete,"This quartet is absolutely amazing. A little more abstract then it's other formation C2B3 (with Les Claypool replacing Bill Laswell on bass), but it certainly does take the listener on a ride.My biggest problem with this recording is that the show I saw at Bonnaroo in 2004 was certainly more than 58 minutes long. And with any jamband, you can't just edit out the long parts. That's what makes the song. These guys started playing at midnight and went on for over three discs worth of music. This version cuts out songs like Maggot Brain and the Seven Laws of Woo, and though she is found at certain parts of the show, Lili Haydn's violin work is not given justice on this version. It's just too bad to see what was on of the best performances of the weekend hacked to bits so it could be packaged and more quickly digestible. For the full show, search livedownloads and get the entire show for eleven bucks or so. If you've read this much, then you owe it to yourself to do that."
3,These guys ran our country for 12 years?,"Scheer shows how Reagan and Bush supported the small fringe of scientists who thought nuclear war winnable and actually bought into their theories. Let's be glad the Soviets started getting competent leaders like Gorby just as we were having a decline in our leadership talent. Scheer does a good job of utilizing information from the majority of the scientific community to show that nuclear war is just not ""winnable"" and thus should never be attempted. I guess following the ideas of an Einstein go against Reaganism."
4,Well organized with new ideas that anyone can follow,This book not only helps explain what to do but why. It is written in an organized manner that allows one to read cover to cover or skip around. The seasonal ideas do not have to be followed in that sometimes fall dishes do work in the summer if the feeling is right.
4,Excellent!! A highly recommended antidote to von-Daniken!,"Noorbergen is a breath of fresh air when it comes to the whole 'ancient astronauts' problem. His attempt to look at the evidence for some sort of prehistoric advanced civilization from a Biblical standpoint is a welcome relief from the 'true believers' who often sell humanity short by over-reliance upon the visiting extraterrestrial hypothesis in order to explain 'ooparts' or amazing feats of human accomplishment. This book's open-minded approach is also a welcome change from that of the hard-core scientific skeptic who often refuses to even consider the evidence for advanced prehistoric technology. Noorbergen may be a bit gullible at times; but, even so, this book is one of the best introductions on the subject of prehistoric advanced civilizations for any interested Christian person who wishes to avoid the high level of bullcrap out there. Good reading!"
2,"Great band, terrible DVD","First of all, who was the spastic genius who decided that concert films had to change camera angles every five seconds? This is terribly anoying, especially when every third shot is of the same audience members. This may be fun for a home video, but not for a mass marketed commercial release.The Dance Hall Crashers are an awesome band. Much of the fun of seeing the DHC in concert is their highly kinetic stage presence. It would have been great if this DVD had concentrated on the band as a whole and not just different extreme closeups switched at a dizzying rate.And since the DHC are supposed to be the focus, why does the director insist on featuring so many shots of the audience? It gets on your nerves.I love the DHC. Their live CD has a permanent place on my playlist. But this horribly made DVD only made it through three songs. Perhaps if I had been at the front of the stage that night, I would appreciate it more."
4,Not as hard as I thought it would be,"A very informative book; some great recipes, and the majority are not as hard to make (I hate being/working in the kitchen), as I thought they would be. I recommend it to all those with insulin resistance and diabetes. A longer list of low GI foods and even some brand names would certainly have improved the book."
4,Love this!,"Not only are the recipes good, but there are a TON. I wanted something where we weren't eating the same 5 meals every week, and that's what this is. Love all the options!"
2,not what I was looking for,"This book has a decent description of the glycemic index and glycemic load in the front. However, for carb sensitive people, this book misses the point. Woodruff substitutes whole grains for the refined grains, yogurt and fruit snacks for pretzels and chips, and otherwise sticks to the government recommendation of around 227-252 grams (50%) of carb per day. I think if your body can tolerate that many carbs, this book will provide healthy meals. And who wouldn't want to chow down on pasta and pancakes every day. But it's not for me."
1,Not for South Beach fans,"I bought this book from Amazon based on the rave reviews. I should have read the bad reviews first. This book contains a lot of recipes using egg substitute and low fat/non-fat ingredients and then uses white flour, pasta, sugar, raisins, carrots and other ingredients we wouldn't consider ""Good Carbs."" We were looking for a cookbook using healthy low-glycemic carbs and healthy fats. Unfortunately, they won't be found in this book.Perhaps this book is aimed at beginners who are trying to move away from carbohydrate addiction."
5,Umm Umm good!,"I received this book yesterday -- saw one recipe ""Quick Chicken Chili"" -- I had all but one ingredient on hand. Less than 20 mins start to eating. Its absolutely delicious!!Somethings I will be substituting since I am trying to avoid all wheat products,most dairy, sugar. The moderate recipes can be brought to low with a bit of modification.There's so many I want to try now, I have seveal chronic illnesses doing pretty good with them. But realized my eating habits needed a over haul to have any more break through success and lose some weight. Her introductions even specify if eating out the restaurants to avoid (chinese -- who would have thought) and what to eat at other restaurants -- avoid and allowable to stay low glycemic.So glad I bought this!!"
1,did not work for me,"never met a tater I didn't love...didn't give me my essential taste bud's needs, was no value to me at all, donated to the library."
3,Haven't found a good recipe yet,I wish I could find a recipe that turns tasting good. So far the deserts I've tried haven't been the best...I buy good ingredients and I measure exactly and so far....not good. However I will keep trying! The explanations concerning the GI Indes I believe is excellent and it all makes sense. That alone made the book worth it.
2,Cookbook,"Was told this book has lots of soup recipes but they all call for bullion have to watch my salt and no MSG ,also lots of wheat can't have not the book for me having to watch this stuff even though it was recommended by a nutritionist so don't order if you are in the same boat."
5,"I'll have another, please","Well done! This book gives a well-written and easy to understand overview of how different carbohydrates result in different physical responses, with implications for weight and health. Then it provides a nice selection of practical, easy-to-prepare recipes comprised of the ""good carbohydrates."" I was so pleased with the book that I bought copies as gifts for three other people so far - all who have been enthusiastic about it as well. My only complaint is that there were not more vegetarian recipes - but I realize that the book is designed for someone eating a more typical American diet. Nevertheless, there are enough recipes in it that I can use to make it worth it to me."
2,Good Carb,"I was disappointed in this book. I bought it because it was recommended on Amazon website. The recommendations suggested it over the Powerfood Cookbooks, but I found the recipes in the Good Carb Cookbook to be of far less quality than those in Powerfoods Cookbooks."
3,Great Book - Missing Pages,"I was really excited to receive this cookbook because of the great reviews. The first book I received was missing 30 pages, they weren't torn out but the book was bound without them. I called Amazon and they sent a new one, this book is missing the same pages. Maybe this edition was not bound correctly. Such a shame."
2,Huge Disappointment,"Many of the reviewers mentioned how great the recipes were. I admit I have not tried one because the author lost her credibilty with me when she included sugar (a bad carb) in many many recipes. Additionally, most of her recipes look like all the low-fat recipes I already have. I was looking for more non-sugar recipes myself."
2,A pretty interesting book.....,"This was a pretty interesting book once you got to the recipes. There is a lot of information at the beginning of the book that I just looked at because I was looking for recipes I could use. If you are looking for a book that will explain what carb's are, you might like it. This is a full size paperback book."
2,Maybe good for beginners/novices,"I was very disappointed with this cookbook. I was directed to it when I searched on South Beach Diet items. This cookbook has very simplistic recipes, many of which are high in refined carbs (!?). It is not an appropriate companion for South Beach or Atkins Dieters. If you had very little knowledge about cooking and foods, you may find some of it helpful. There are better choices, though. (South Beach Diet Cookbook for one.)"
2,"A Scientist Yes, A Cook No",The first section of this book is an excellent introduction to using the glycemic index as it relates to insulin resistance and all the other carbohydrate and diet related issues which are so hot today. The second half of the book is an awful cookbook. The recipes which call for 95% fat free chop meat for instance betray a lack of knowledge of what makes food taste good. If I had the book in front of me I could site more examples but in general I was struck by the author's desire to offer both low calorie recipes along with ones that avoid foods high on the glycemic index without regard to the flavor of the end result. What you get is a pretty standard low calorie diet minus the baked potatoes and the breakfast cereal. My advise would be to read the first portion of the book and then use the information to modify recipes written by real cooks.
1,Boring with small print,"I have read many books on health and nutrition but this one was boring with extremely tiny print. The information is valid, but the way they explained it was a bit technical. I have read the information on low glycemic carbs in other books and it was explained in layman's terms. This book could not hold my interest. Then, when I decided to just turn to the recipes, they were filled with more carbs than I thought they would have. Nothing new, just the same old boring stuff. I returned my copy as I just couldn't get through it. I think I could be more creative in the kitchen without this book."
2,A cookbook with no photos? How lame is that?,"It's difficult to browse for menu ideas when there are no photos.It's also hard to make something you've never seen before because you aren't sure what it's supposed to look like during the process or when you're done. There IS good information to help you understand and apply low glycemic concepts to your diet, but she uses egg substitutes, chemical sugar substitutes, and other questionable ingredients. If you're looking for healthy recipes, you'll need to substitute natural ingredients for such unhealthy ingredients."
4,good enough...,"This CD basically has all the songs of the Suzuki Vol. 5 recorded, except for the extra excerises of course (eg. string crossing etude, tonalization...).Mr. Preucil plays with a piano accompanist, except for the case of ones that are supposed to be unaccompanied of course (eg. Bach suite).His playing serves as a good example on how the pieces should generally sound. I say generally because his playing style is slightly bland. He sticks to what the music says.So buy it if you want an example to play by."
1,do not buy!,"I tried to hook up this KVM switch and struggled with the cable placement like everyone else talked about. And then powered it on and it started beeping. I had a wired keyboard and mouse plugged in. Didn't matter, still beeped. So I double checked my cables, and still it beeped. Then I switched the mouse to the keyboard side and it stopped beeping, however the computer now interpreted the mouse movements as keystrokes and every move of the mouse would type jibberish into any available text box. So now I have a 2nd mouse plugged into the keyboard port to stop the beeping and my main mouse is plugged into one of the alternate device ports. This product is so incredibly bad. I wouldn't even expect this out of a knockoff."
1,piece of #@%^,"This has to be absulotely the worst product I have ever used. Whatever you do, no matter how desparate you are, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It sucks.I refuse to go into detail, else I get even madder than I am now.Belkin can kiss my posterior.You, the buyer, please go find another product. Even a trained monkey."
1,"Unreliable, poor online support, expensive, doesn't work.","Shame on you Belkin, why does this product have so many flaws?? Firstly, the missing keystrokes, causing you to send emails with missing characters, meaning you have to spell check everything even if your spelling is perfect. But you still send 'an' instead of 'and'. ArghhOn one of the PCs I am using, on boot up, the keyboard NEVER works. I have to go into the device manager for that PC to uninstall the driver that is not functioning properly, and reinstall it, and if the PC gods are looking down favourably on me, the keyboard starts to work. Otherwise I have to resort to other methods to breath life into the dang thing.The firmware upgrade, I thought OK, maybe this could solve all my problems, but using a parallel cable, both of my PCs don't have a parallel port! Why not use a USB connection??? Arrgghh.If you are thinking of buying a 2 port switch box, do what I am going to have to do, look elsewhere."
1,Thi suck very badly,"Im typing this rview through my belkin omniview.I have impcbble spelling, but thfuing thing dropsalmost everkestroke. If you don't mind your writing loking like ths ten go aheadand buy it."
1,"Bad connector layout, slow keyboard rate","I've used KVM switches from Belkin before with good results, so I was really disappointed when I used this one.My main problem is that the switch seemed to be dropping some of my keyboard strokes. So, for example, if I typed ""The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"" what appeared on my screen was something like ""Th quckbron fx jumpd ovrhe lzy do"".There were several other minor annoyances. The connectors are poorly laid out; for example: (1) when the power plug is inserted into the power connector, the plug covers one of the spare USB ports; (2) the monitor connector is located so close to the rear of the unit that it was difficult to attach a monitor cable. I would have been able to live with these issues, but the keyboard problem was just too big a problem."
2,Avoid Until Further Notice,"I received this KVM along with the MS Desktop Elite for Bluetooth (mouse & keyboard) Combo for Xmas. Upon installing the KVM with all the cables needed and the no-keyboard firmware update I came to find out that I could NOT switch between the two computers. The KVM just sits there with the 1st computer light blinking rapidly and pressing the buttons does NOT work. Other than the fact that it doesn't not switch (the entire purpose of a KVM) this is a good product. The video, keyboard & mouse all work great on CPU1 input. I have emailed tech support but they haven't been very good at all with replying back to my messages!! DON'T buy this!"
3,Useful,"This book is about as useful as the last one. Once again I take issue with his calibrations. Following the method he outlines in several of his books I conducted calibrations and got results: Dr. Howkins calibrates at 422 (Mother Theresa at 424); Power vs Force at 570; The Eye of I at 350 and I, Reality and Subjectivity at 364. On virtually any calibration he gave that I have tried to confirm, I got a different result. I believe this guy has done a lot of good work, but I also think he is subject to the ego like the rest of us."
1,Dr. HAWKINS JOINS THE RELIGIOUS WAR HAWKS,"With the last book of his trilogy, Dr. Hawkins comes out as one of the very things he criticizes in his writings: the religious warriors.Giving his full support to the Bush/Neocon war party, he lets the world know that he is no different from the fundamentalist Christian and fundamentalist Moslem sects who are presently manipulating the world into one global fascist state."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Had this phone for a little over a year and a half, it was ok at first but then it's flaws came through. Being a slide phone, it's never going to last especially given the fact the slide is not spring assisted also it was extremely slow and froze quite a bit even after firmware upgrades. Finally the display went out so I bought an N82, infinitely better phone. All the features of the N80 plus more with none of the drawbacks. If you're considering buying this phone, do yourself a favor and check out the N82."
2,Really Not Very Good,I enjoyed Scott previously with Game Theory and some of Loud Family. What this proves to me is that some bands are best live and some best in the studio. This one is best in the studio.
4,Pool Pump,The pump is a direct replacement to my old pump. Took me 10 minutes to swap out and it's running great. Couldn't be happy with the pump or with VM Innovations.
3,arg,"I bought this showerhead for my mom for mother's day and it would have been awesome but we were never able to use it. The problem I encountered was the pipe coming out of the wall that the head connects to does not come out far enough for the S arm to clear the wall, so we were never able to put the showerhead up. After many attempts and trips to Home Depot to find something to extend the pipe so the shower head could fit I could not find anything that worked. So, just beware. The most annoying part about this, was the only thing that the company needed to do was make the bolt on the S arm that connects to the pipe turn instead of it being stationary."
4,Excellent!,While looking for a new showerhead we found this gem! Its a bit pricey but worth it. We enjoy it. I stay in the shower sometimes to relax.
3,Better Looking than Functional,"Great looking showerhead if you have people looking at your shower. Functionally questionable. Need a lot of water pressure to utilize all the head. You cannot adjust the pressure in this head by taking the flow limiter out, so the middle part of the head works great, the remaining head is kindof pathetic."
1,DP1006 Tubes Shower Head,If I had saved the box I would have returned this product. The head has no pressure what so ever and the head does not screw onto the pipe spout straight so it is always crooked. And it wasnt just one shower I tried it one both of my showers and it was crooked on both pipes.
2,saving water?,"If saving water is your joy, this is it. Not much water comes out. Also own the rain showerhead, which we all fight to use."
5,Old Friends That Improved With Age,"I forgot how great these albums are. This is Walter post-Lindsey & Stevie, a bit too precocious and goofy for the maintream, wearing it all on his sleeve in a most melodic, ripping rock 'n roll way. I love the contrast between over-the-moon in love Walter (Hi-Fi) and pissed off Walter (The Last Stroll). The guitar work on these albums is superb. Turns out I've been reproducing these solos in my music career over and over again -- and I'd forgotten where they'd come from. Back around when these albums came out I saw Walter open for David Lindley at Perkins Palace in Pasadena. TALK ABOUT GUITAR HEAVEN. Anyway, bravo Walter, these were shamefully ignored albums. Money back guarantee."
5,Great Video & Audio Quality,"The video and audio quality of this DVD is much, much better than on TV. I don't think it's remastered, but it's still better anyway."
5,Lighten Up and Enjoy!,"My boys who are 9 & 7 are the ones who ""subjected"" me to Spongebob on Nickelodeon. I have to admit though, after watching a few episodes of this silly sponge with the infectious laugh...I was hooked. I purchased the DVD for my kids but I enjoy it just as much.If you are an adult who liked Bugs Bunny as a kid, you will like this cartoon. There are things for adults and children...hey its written by a 40 yr old! The best part too is that with everything else that your kids can choose to watch on TV, at least with Spongebob, there is always a moral behind the story that is always a healthy one to boot!So, sit down with your kids and enjoy some time off with SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs and Sandy in Bikini Bottom!"

2,Good,Had a few skips in it when my baby viewed it but is exceptable by him so I guess we are satisfied with the purchase
3,Belgian Heroine,"Easy to read story of the little known Belgian resistance in ww2. Real life stories can be amazing, and fill you full of envy, delight, fear. However, this book is so understated that although the writer did some courageous and amazing things, risking her life daily, she does not portray this, and leaves the reader dissatisfied. Sometimes modesty is not such a virtue."
2,Does not live up to its title,"I was interested in this book as my father had been a communist resistant in Gent, Belgium. I hoped it would give me insight into life under occupation. Trouble is our resistant author, although very brave is a bit of a cow. The sanctamonius putdowns of all and sundry while blowing her own trumpet wore thin and detracted from the story she had to tell. It did not paint a picture of being under occupation that other autobiographies/biographies have. Compared with ""Gaston's War""-Gaston Vandermeerssche- it is pale and insipid. Nor does the spunk stand scrutiny next to Nancy Wake (The White Rabbit)- Ms Wake was also a bit of a character but she could tell a good story and her bitchiness was sauce to what was a complex person. She did not have to settle scores. However, all stories of survival are worthy of being told. My father never told his. Never received more than a comendation from his government (Belgium) and hated war to his dying breath."
4,Great adventure in the Forgotten Realms,"To the rescue! Against all odds, the horrifically outmatched heroes must save Randal Morn from the clutches of the she-lich, Gothul - as if that weren't enough, the Zhentarim enter the picture at the worst of possible moments! A great action adventure, very hard to find... from the ""lean"" years of short TSR printing runs."
5,Terrific Work Shoe,"This is my second pair of Wolverine work shoes. The prior ones lasted 9 years and took a lot of heavy use. They are built strong. This pair has even tougher eyelets and hooks for the laces. The picture is slightly misleading - the top of the boot is swede leather, not the fuzzy stuff - but swede is more preferred by me. The boot is a good value for the money. Note: my normal size is men's 12 and it seems with Wolverine only, they run slightly smaller (both this pair and my original ones)."
5,Wolverine keeps making a good boot!,I've been wearing Wolverine boots for over 20 years. They take a lot of abuse from me and still last longer than any other work boot I have tried. These new boots appear to be built with the same high level of quality I have come to expect from them while still maintaining an affordable price!
1,EW??????,"Returned these Boots. They claim to be Extra Wide, but they are not. Extremely disappointed with this product. Does anybody really carry Extra Wide Boots. For the record Extra Wide = 4E"
2,"Good quality, but awful color.","This is a good quality boot. However, it does not look like the online photo. The boot is actually much darker and the visible portion of the sole has a greenish stripe on it. Everybody asks me if I just finished cutting the lawn when I wear these boots. Very disappointed with the look and therefore don't wear them much."
4,Soothing,"I really enjoyed this movie, it was really soothing. I loved the part at the Grand Canyon, but don't understand when the Christmas Dinner party happened. I loved the music. Does anyone know what songs played in this movie?"
2,painful,"The personality of the female lead character was so self centered, shallow, and annoying, it was impossible to continue watching. I turned it off after about 40 minutes."
5,What a dear book...,"They just don't make 'em like this anymore. So charming, so sweetly humorous, such a perfect read for our children."
2,ok at first,"I have owned this unit for just over a year, at first it was ok but the remote had to be about 6 inches from the eye to work and every time you turn on the ignition you would have to manually turn this on too, it does not come on automaticaly with the ignition. Now after about a year of use the unit will work great for about 20 minutes and the just say input 1 on the screen as if it is not getting a signal. I tried every input same thing after 20 minutes it just comes up and says input 1 (or whatever input you are on). I know my video source is working because if I bypass the tuner and go direcly to my moniter it works fine. All in all save your money this tuner only does anolog not digital. By a DTV converter box with anolog pass through (if you must have anolog) and buy a a\v switcher. I bought the jenson KSW41 for way less and works so much better.The jenson also has three video outputs so you do not have to use a signal robbing splitter."
4,Readable early introduction to Existensial thought,"In this book William Barrett provides a historical survey of the main sources of Existensialm, analyzes in depth four major Existensialist thinkers, and shows how Existensialist themes pervade the work of many important figures of twentieth century Literature. He also considers the question of the Rationality of modern Technical and Scientific Man and provides a sense of the irrationality of a too absolute Rationality. This book written in a way far more clear than many original Existensial texts provides a good introduction to the subject for the 'common reader'."
3,Okay,Decent product but kept getting tangled up when reeling in. It works just fine if you don't need to use the reel on it.
2,Avoid,"The spring stopped working after a few weeks. I've had other retractable cable products (earphones, USB cables, etc.) and the springs all stop working after awhile, however this was twice the cost of the other products that I've used and lasted only a fraction of the time."
5,"Terrific Cable, wish it was a bit cheaper","Great retractable USB cable. I just wish it was a tad bit cheaper. Either way though, everyone always admires the retractable feature of the cable. Very useful/handy for portable use."
2,USB cable,I bought 2 of these cables after reading a review that said the USB-A mini B would work to replace the kindle cables that fall apart. They don't fit in the Kindle. I'll be returning them.
1,Belkin Retractable USB Cable,"I spent a couple of hours trying to find out why an external USB HD was not recognized by my Mac Pro. I tried 2 different miniature USB retractable cables by Belkin. No dice. So I reinitialized the drive again. Still no luck, tried connecting to another Mac, frustration. Then I had the bright idea of using a USB miniature cable, not by Belkin, success!Who could have figured, 2 different Belkin retractable cables, both bad.I'll never, ever buy another Belkin product!"
5,"Preparing the Way: The Reopening of the John G. Lake Healing Rooms in Spokane, Washington","Very incouraging, inspiring, and informational story of how and why the Healing Rooms movement got started here in America. This book will help inspire you to expect more from our Lord than just having a good Sunday morning service. I highly recommend this book."
2,Just OK........,"I bought this movie first, because it claims to be a horror movie and also I love any movie about insane asylums. I've seen much worse movies but this one isn't great by no stretch of the imagination. I must admit that Larry Drake does play the role of a deranged psycho pretty good. He has that psycho look.... bald, evil looking, wearing a straight jacket and all. We find him loose in the asylum with a female psychiatrist trapped there in a maze trying to hide from the psycho! She finds aid in the janitor, played by Judd Nelson ( who is weird himself! ) only to find out he was also an inmate of the looney bin. Not a slasher or gore film. At times, a bit boring, at times not. I'd suggest just Rent it only!!"
3,"dark asylum, but not that dark","one of the reviewers said not be able to sleep if you watch it alone? hahaha umm ok. i got the movie cause i figured it would have some suspenseful parts but there was none really to say the least, maybe a couple of small ones but nothin big. was a very predictable movie for the most part it seemed like but it was also pretty entertaining and fun to watch for the most part. think larry drake played the bad guy and he did a pretty good job of playing the mental patient, good acting all around for a half decent storyline. all in all it is worth checking out."
5,Rock N' Roll!,"This suspense filled movie about a diabolical, insane killer, a helplessly trapped psychiatrist, and a caught up in the mix janitor gives new meaning to the term astonishing! The doctor, played saucily by Paulina Porizkova, becomes trapped in an insane asylum at night with no way out. The deranged lunatic, performed admirably by Larry Drake Jr., hunts her down, as they play cat and mouse. Meanwhile, a hapless janitor, played brilliantly by Judd Nelson (The Breakfast Club), tries to help the doctor, and survive the night. Will the sun rise before ""The Thrasher"" catches the doctor and janitor?Rent or buy this exciting movie and find out!Also: great directing by Gregory Gieras."
1,dark asylum- worst movie ever,"You can tell by the other reviews that this movie is pretty bad. Actually, 1 star is too much for a rating. It is amazing how this movie got produced. I laughed pretty hard most of the movie, as did my friend. You know when you see a train wreck, you just gotta look? This movie is the same way. Poor story, bad acting, bad writing, lame effects, just awful. We watched the movie and got some good laughs, but it seems like it never ends."
3,Return to Death Row,"Dark Asylum: Return to Death Row is the sequel to the Bret Michaels (from the rock band Poison) movie ""A Letter from Death Row"".Bret Michaels doesn't star, write or direct part 2 as he did with the original but he does appear on the cover of the international version which is simply titled ""Return to Death Row"". The US version is titled ""Dark Asylum"" with a different cover. The movie is ok but not as good as the original."
2,NUTHOUSE BLUES,"There are so many implausibilities and coincidences in DARK ASYLUM, one would think at least one of them would be suspenseful. Alas and alack, no such luck. We get the ever interminably boring Larry Drake as the Trasher, a serial killer who has murdered several people and hidden their bodies in the cities sewer system. They catch him and lock him up in a soon to be closed down asylum, waiting for the feds to pick him up at midnight. This asylum also houses Dr. Jurgen Prochnow, an elderly psychiatrist who wants one last chance to make Drake talk. Paulina Portikova couldn't be more trite and boring if she tried; Judd Nelson as an inmate and janitor tries hard but his scenes are so small that he can't save the sinking ship. The cops are all stupid, and why in the world are there hand grenades in a mental hospital? Little suspense is generated, and the film's climactic ending routine.Some of the camera work is interesting, so it's not a total bomb...but it's not far!"
5,A RARE GEM OF A THRILLER!!!,"All I can say is... wow, this was a real find. I am a huge thriller fan and this movie has it all!!! If you liked Seven, Silence of the Lambs, and Halloween, then you will love DARK ASYLUM. The directing was solid, the acting was right on, and the pace was non-stop. This is a must-rent and a must-have for your video collection. I rented this movie with a new girlfriend and she was practically sitting in my lap within ten minutes!!! BE BUT WARNED: DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE ALONE - YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SLEEP!!!"
1,Not a very durable product,"After a few uses, 2 problems emerged: (1) the elastic stretched very easily so it no longer ensures a proper fit; and (2) one of the kneepads broke (i.e. the plastic protective cover separated from the rest of the kneepad). The inexpensive cost is not worth it so I would recommend that you pay the extra money and invest in a better set of protective gear."
2,Very small pads,"In the title it states (Child). I am not sure what they consider child when considering their sizes. I perceived that it would fit maybe 4-6 or 7 year olds. These might accommodate a small 4 year old? They appeared to be of a reasonable quality for a $12 set of pads. Our kids never got to try them out, the Velcro straps weren't long enough to fit around our kids legs. Placed back in the bag and returned. Thankfully amazon is great and even paid for shipping back due to the sizing issue."
2,Agree with others - too small for 5+,"I read the other reviews that said this product was too small for 5+. I purchased the next size up and it was swimming on my 5 year old and I was worried they wouldn't stay put and actually protect her so I went ahead and ordered these ones anyway assuming maybe the other 5 year olds were larger children (my daughter is petite). When I go them, though, I couldn't even get the velcro around her elbows or knees. That leaves me with a choice to somehow get a velcro extension for these or go back to the 8+ pack that were falling off. I'm really dissapointed with the sizing options offered. :("
2,Not what was pictured,"I ordered this product for my son's birthday and was expecting what was pictured (knee and elbow pads and helmet). To my surprise when I opened the box today there was no helmet. I emailed customer service so we'll see what happened. The pads look great, but Amazon failed to meet my expectations.1/12/08 Amazon re-shipped another set at no cost. I received it today and again there was no helmet. Just the pads. Very disappointing."
1,A complete waste of money,"This is one of the poorest quality videos I've ever seen. The graphics and voice-over are amateurish and worse - not funny. The picture quality is terrible. And most of the so called bloopers are just routine plays. Many of the teams represented are unrecognizable to American NFL or college ball fans. They appear to be CFL or European NFL minor league teams, or perhaps from one of the now defunct (USFL, WFL, etc.) NFL competitors. That wouldn't be a concern if the clips were amusing or interesting on any level, but unfortunately they are neither."
1,Worst movie in the history of the world,"I bought this movie to show my flatmates in Scotland the joys of American Football. We all gathered around the TV on Thanksgiving and watched this movie and soon realized it consisted of about 10 minutes of footage that is repeated throughout the film. The only diffence is the annoying commentary and perhaps the most horrific soundtrack ever created changes slightly.Seriously, the same footage is shown 2 or 3 times...it's crazy. I would not except this movie for free much less buy it again. The only good thing that resulted from this movie was the joy we felt as we repeatedly smashed the VHS after it was over. Yes we did watch the whole thing in hopes that there would be one moment of goodness...but alas there was not.DO NOT BUY"
3,Decent for the price,"This fan can move a lot of air. For the price it's not bad. I use it to blow the cold AC air on the second story of our townhouse to the 3rd floor. For that purpose it works well.The cons are the control knob is kind of cheap feeling, and a little loose. It's also pretty noisy. On the medium or high setting you can't really be in the same room with it. But if you have it in another room blowing air around the house it is tolerable."
4,Clicks,"This fan moves a lot of air. You can position it to point straight up in the air or blow air across the room. For some reason, it clicks when it's on and I'm sending it back."
4,An air-mover,"It isn't quiet. It doesn't have bells and whistles. It doesn't come in a fancy case. It doesn't oscillate.This fan is, simply, an air-mover. All fans can blow air...but this one moves it. I sat mine at the end of a hallway in my home. The blast could be felt 20 feet away. It is loud...though not as loud as one might expect. With a simple power switch that also doubles as a speed control, this air-mover is simple, easy-to-use, and very, very functional.It's best used to help circulate air in your home. If you have a room that is stuffy or doesn't return air to your HVAC, this air-mover can really help.If you need to ventilate a room, this air-mover can help.It reminds me of an industrial-strength fan used after janitors apply chemicals to a floor. They use these big fans to get rid of the smell and help dry the floor. This air-mover can probably do both just as well.Comes pre-assembled. Just take it out of the box, plug it in, and you are moving air."
2,"Powerful, but loud","I own this fan and I think it's too loud for a small room. It does move an impressive amount of air, but even at its lowest setting it's too loud for my liking. It might be more useful in a larger room setting, but for a small room the noise is too much."
2,FAN MOTOR DIED IN LESS THEN 1 YR,I bought this fan last March and after less then a year's worth of use the motor just completely died. If you plan on using this fan more then a few nights out of the year I would suggest going with a more industrial brand.
5,great fan for the price!,"I purchased these fans to use in our church (some areas are not air-conditioned). During the hottest week of the year, it was tolerable. Although they are not quiet, they did the job for a great price. Most folks were willing to listen a little more attentively if they could feel more comfortable."
1,Great fan when it works; died within a year,"This is a really nice fan. It makes a good amount of noise, but I really don't mind fan noise, and it definitely was able to move air -- I didn't even have to use it at max speed to be comfortable most of the time.This would be a 5 star review.. but it died after 8 months. I bought it specifically for THIS summer, and the fact that it died before the summer really got hot pisses me off to no end. It really doesn't matter how good the fan is when it's DEAD."
2,honeywell hf 810,I would agree w/ all the reviews good and bad -but will add that I have had my current one about 3 years and it has developed a loud squeal -almost like a bad bearing noise -it is intermittent -but when using for white noise and air movement when sleeping -the start of that squeal makes it impossible to keep fan running and sleep -I realize this is not an expensive fan -but I expected it to have lasted longer
3,"Powerful, but WAY too loud and HARD to clean","It is nearly imossible to remove the grill to clean this fan and it is the loudest fan I have ever heard. It's like someone is riding a Harley in my living room. That being said, it is also a powerful fan. It turns my stuffy living room into a tropical windstorm. High highs and low lows."
3,Dead in less than 4 years,Bought this in June 2007. Motor died in March 2011. I've never thought much of plastic fans and this one hasn't changed my mind.
5,love it,I wanted a fan that wasn't bulky and imposing but nevertheless powerful. This fan is all of these things. Love it!.
4,Exactly what I'm looking for,"We were looking for a fan that was powerful and moved the air, but also wanted one that made a ""white noise"" for us to sleep to. This fan is perfect for both those desires. It was exactly what we were looking for. It also turned out not to be to big and clunky and fits nice in the corner of our room, either on the floor or on our nightstand."
3,mega turbo fan,"I bought this Honeywell item because I previously purchased honeywell window fans and they work very well.This product is powerful but has limited effectiveness in the area that it cools,probably due to small blades.My major complaint,and the reason that I only gave it three stars is the switch.It is not user friendly and not intuitive."
1,Mediocre,"I had high hopes for this book, having recently attended a seminar put on by Peter Montoya's agency - but at best it is a blatant sales pitch for Mr. Montoya's advertising agency. After looking at the glowing reviews listed here, I was at first surprised to see a review from a ""Topher"" - the speaker at the seminar I attended was named ""Topher"". A coincidence? Possibly. Until you notice that almost all of the reviews come from Southern California - the very location of Mr. Montoya's agency. Amazon.com readers might be better served if some one other than Mr. Montoya's ""friends"" actually wrote some reviews."
3,Branding rebranded,"The book had some interesting points and useful exercises, but do not be over-sold based on the hype (""double your income in under a year"" seems like a stretch). There is a lot more to personal branding than what appears in this book and I doubt that most people will see a 100% increase in their personal earnings in under a year based on the advice in this book alone.All in all, a useful, interesting read and some sound exercises and advice."
5,Great Book!,I loved this book. I have my own business and have found this book to be an easy read with real solutions. The strategies and tools offered in this book have given me a real focus on how to brand my myself... and my company. Brilliant!
4,Pretty cool,My 3 year used this on our road trip. He really liked playing with the magnets. Thank you very much!
2,"Excellent cast, what happened?","With several first rate actors and excellent filming, I was dismayed by the weak story and dialog, just not at all what I expected. Julie Christie's character is too haughty and conceited (snarl, snarl, snarl, who would want to be around her for a minute, let alone be married to her?), and Glenda Jackson is quaintly dowdy but amazingly we are told this ordinary lower middle-class woman has a romantic history with our rich, shell-shocked hero. In a nutshell, the story wasn't believable, and the script seemed to lack subtlety. The sets, costumes, filming, and cast should have resulted in something fantastic, like a Merchant/Ivory film, but it didn't come off well, and the stilted dialog and uncomfortable acting were the kiss-off. It's strange how so many terrific components would not add up."
4,Return of the Soldier,"Great plot dealing with a WWI British officer who is shellshocked and suffers amnesia concerning his past 15 years. He is cured but the cure is perhaps worse than the affliction.Great acting, music and photograhy. No special features. 1983 release.JBF"
4,Good to see you too Alice!,With this DVD you get a great 70's rock show. The 5.1 sounds pretty good for almost a 35 year old film. The DVD transfer is better than expected. Alice also gives a running commentary! This film is Pure 70's bliss.
3,Where to begin...where to begin?,"I expected a concert video similar to what is usually released today, but I was surprised to see that the DVD is comprised of a live show and a kookie storyline that wraps around it, similar to the Monkees' Head or the Beatles Yellow Submarine.The movie part of it revolves around a crazy German director who chases down the Alice Cooper Band because they ruined his movie. The opening skit is priceless, but after that it gets a little rough. The live performance highlight the group at the pinnacle of their career, and of course they sound great.Although the DVD boasts the typical AC theatrics, they really don't come into play until the last half of the set. You do have the option to watch the performance only. Bonuses include Alice commentary, trailers, photo galleries, and outtakes"
3,billion dollar babies,The begining of this dvd is pretty silly and there's a attempt to do acting by this german dude that is really stupid but if you can get passed the bad acting the concert footage is a real treat for lovers of the original alice cooper band.
2,disappointing Cooper in a Stupor is NOT super-duper,"Here are the BAD POINTS:very lackluster performance - not hitting the notes, no energythe audio sounds like the instruments weren't miked - just a couple of mikes pointing at the stage - very muddy, no presence.the 5.1 audio mix is really poor and ""far away"" soundingthe skits are amaturish, stupid and endless!GOOD POINTS:interesting to see Alice at this stage in his careerhis commentary makes parts of it bearable - I still skipped thru a lot of it.BOTTOM LINE:Don't expect much. it's okay to watch once. Try to get a buddy to buy it - then watch his copy.I'm sticking with the studio production CDs. :("
2,Weak production!,"I absolutely LOVE Alice Cooper.....especially the original band.....HOWEVER, I really think this DVD is garbage. It's almost like someone filmed it on a hand held camera and then put it on a DVD...on their home computer! ....bad photography, and everything other then the actual concert footage is a complete waste of time. I actually asked for this for Christmas.......big mistake. Buy one of the newer concert DVDs....much better!"
3,Mediocre,I found the DVD to be OK. It's not great but at the same time it doesn't stink. The sound is also mediocre. I would reccommend it to big Alice fans.
2,I Guess I Grew Up,"Geez....way back THEN, I absolutely loved Alice. Thirty years later it all looks so immature and ridiculous. His theatrical broadway R & R antics just look wimpy. I still think Alice is probably a pretty cool guy, and I love HEARING his older music (KILLER is still his best album), but this DVD really sucks. It probably deserves 1 star, but I can't bear to give Alice a failing grade, so out of the kindness of my heart, I'll give him 2 stars. Stay away from this DVD.Oh yeah......they promote this DVD as extra shocking and gross........it's not, compared to today's standards. This whole disc just seems silly."
1,suckpatch.......,i use to really like early alice cooper band stuff......that is why i bought this dvd.... ends up this dvd is kinda retarded with some worthless wanna be acting and not only that by the time it actually gets to the concert footage the music quality isn't very good at all.... it's hard to hear the vocals and the footage is kinda grainy like most older movies......i know this dvd was cheaper than most and that is why i bought it but next time i'll probably pass on it....
4,Alice in all his decadent splendor!,"This a great document of Alice in his prime right before the split from his original bandmates which would lead to the(from a rock'n roll point of view) much inferior""Welcome to my Nightmare"" movie.The concert is mixed with some kind of nebulous story wich can fortunately be skipped with the chapter button.Anyway,look at this and see the original madman of decadent rock backed by his great band do all those great rocksongs with Alice in top vocal and theatrical display.Oh! By the way. Alice's audio comment is a must too."
4,The added plot took away,This dvd was good but the plot that they put in with Herr Director was an annoying interference to the concert. apart from the interruptions every song it was a good concert.
2,Clicking to special features doesn't work half the time,"Aside from not realizing this was a movie with horrible interruptions to the concert to ruin the mood of the show, we also found that none of the links would connect - we couldn't get the speciall features to open and play; so we didn't know we could watch a concert version without that horrible bad movie acting sketches in between.the concert was as good as I remmebered, having been there myself in 73; but the DVD is very difficult to move around in. We never have these problems with any other DVDs - and this was brand new. Even our rentals are in better condition than this was."
3,Great Music! Pretty good live video!,This is fun to watch and what GREAT music. He's singing out of key and is out of breath a lot but it's still great to see live video of the old Alice Cooper band. As a musician I always loved playing these songs. One Problem: You don't get to see much close up of the band members playing or doing solos. You can skip the stupid little movie if you want to.
4,Slicing it up with Alice,"As I read some of the other reviews of this film, I read a lot of negatives and they didn't scare me away from buying this video.I was rewarded for sticking with it. Alice Cooper are at their best (don't forget at this time they were a band, not just a man) the concert footage is great. The Stage show was something that wasn't as common as it may be today. Then again it may not be pulled off as well either. If you are into Alice Cooper you want/need this video in your collection."
3,"OK Product, But Some Shortcomings","I purchased this book because I had never used Microsoft Outlook (had been using Lotus Notes for years at work). The book uses primarily examples to illustrate some of the features of Outlook, but does not deal with all of them. To this point, it took me several weeks until I finally figured out how to receive all my mail from my ISP in Outlook (click on ""Tools"", ""send/receive"", then ""send/receive all""); this is such a key feature that it should be prominently explained/discussed in this book.The index is not very comprehensive, so if you are starting your search there, yopu may not find what you are looking for"
5,Great study material,This book tells you exactly what you need to know for the exam. I was able to concentrate on the proper information without worry. I passed the exam first time :D
1,not good,I purchased this item thinking it was the right size for the existing mirror. WRONG It fits on the mirror but alot smaller than what it should be. You can see out of it but looks like crap and is obviously a missmatch. It also came through with a chip out of one corner
2,Junk,"These are sold under a number of brand names, but they look like they are identical. They are junk. I bought one from Grizzly. The drill bit bound and then cut into soft metal of the guides. Each time I drilled a pocket hole, more of the metal was removed. The result was shallower and shallower (and less consistent) holes.I'm spending the $100+ for a KREG."
2,Steelex D1060 Pocket Hole,"Not an easy product to use. It tends to slide too much even with a proper clamp. I recommend a spray of Herculiner truck bed liner, to stabilize the bottom in order to keep the guide from excessive vibration and movement. Also, a second clamp to hold down both guides is also helpful.For best results, the manufacturer recommends a step drill bit of 3/8"" with a 1/4"" tip. Be aware that the bits are rather large and can not touch the black metal guide holes where the bits enter, or else the metal easily grinds away and warps unevenly. This is not an isolated incident, as other reviewers have noted. The guide holes are the worst and most inferior part of this product, which makes it a shame.The adjustable clamp is the only advantage to this tool, as it easily situates the proper distance between pocket holes without an extra ruler."
1,Look else where,I bought this about 10 years ago. I was never all that impressed. The results where marginal at best. Used it this morning and it cut such sloppy holes that I called a friend who had raved about his Kreg jig and asked if I could borrow it for the day. I used the Kreg today and it is superior in every way. Easy to set up and use. It cut perfect holes and the joints are very tight.The Woodstock is in the garbage and I'm ordering a Kreg.
1,...,"Despite being so cheap, I found this overpriced ... it is merely a thin pamphlet comprised of 12 recipes for Christmas. That would have been fine, and I would have been delighted even at many times the price *IF* it had told anything about the recipes, how the family/friends enjoyed them, where the recipes came from, or even if the author had ever tasted them. But just a terse printing of 12 recipes w/o descriptions seems to be a complete waste of space. I was very disappointed; I had really been looking forward to this, mistakingly thinking that it would include brief descriptions and/or recollections. Instead, it didn't include either."
4,"Pretty good, so far","This company really knocks itself out for the customer and I very much appreciate that. Smack in the middle of Storm Sandy, they kept in constant contact and were able to get this order out. I started using it yesterday for the 1st time. Had to remove the sponge applicator as one would have to have a wrestler's grip to squeeze the product. Began applying it with a narrow brush. Worked much better. Some of my grout was black from mold and some just discolored. Will have to go back for a retouch, but thats ok. Anything is better than the untreated grout. Now, getting the excess off may be another story. May have to get a single edged razor blade or a solvant. Havent gotten that far yet. This product is definitely a quick fix and since I am a renter, I dont care about the grout, per se, other than the color. Wish I'd bought the refill and not this item, thereby avoiding the sponge mess. The product is good, the company is the best."
4,"Works, but labor intensive","I have a retro bathroom with small pink tiles... The tiles and the grout are at least 65 years old and were desperately in need of a face lift.Going into it I was not expecting an instant fix, some of the reviews I've read are a little harsh... Even if you would use straight up latex paint and hand paint the grout likes you would still get bleed through, you will need to do layers of this product to get ideal results. I think I did 4, my bathroom is pretty small so I was able to do 4 coats with 2 bottles of the solution.... And I did use all of it. it probably took me 5 days to finish the project. It was very labor intensive, but well worth it. I'm so glad I did it, my bathroom looks brand new.... That being said I will purchase the sealer and do that soon. I am expecting it to fade and need touch ups if i don't seal it. IT IS A STAIN! Be realistic."
3,"Works OK, as good as any other ""quick fix"" whitener","I have a lot of white porcelain tile in my shower where the grout has gotten nasty over time. This whitener works fine, but nothing special. It took me about 3 coats over a few days to get a thick enough covering that I would consider close to looking new. There are still some darker, more stained areas that show through. It's kind of like a grout white wash, not really thick enough to provide much whitening ability in one coat. We'll see how long the sealing effects last and how long it stays white."
3,Tile Guard,"I was pleased with the results, but the results did not last long. It has been less than 6 months and it doesn't look like I used the product."
2,Wrong description,"this is not a so called ""break Away"" lanyard. One has to press the side buttons in order for the badge to release. That is not a break away it should be identify as detachedable. Break away lanyards are designed for safety in case your badge or keys get caught in something hazardous, the lanyard breaks away without you having to release the badge manually."
5,Breakaway Lanyard,I bought the lanyard and when I received the item it was exactly as it was described by the seller. It's a great item and I would recommend to people looking for a basic lanyard that's reliable. If you lay the item flat from end to end it measures approximately 22 inches and is very lightweight. The breakaway feature works great it takes very little pressure to break and it won't unsnap unless you pull at it. I would recommend it to people working in healthcare settings or other settings that require the snap off safety feature.
4,"Works well, but badge is allowed to rotate","I use this to hang my badge from and it works pretty well. You can snap the badge free if you have to but if you worked in a machine shop, you'd want a breakaway version. The big problem is that the bottom freely rotates. That's fine except the badge is fond of rotating to face my chest instead of outward. Still it's a pretty good badge chain."
3,Won't last very long,"After just a few weeks use, the cord is fraying badly where it meets the plastic fixture and I expect I'll need to replace this fairly soon. It does what it's supposed to do, but it clearly will not do it for very long."
5,Jillian Jiggs to the Rescue,"""Jillian Jiggs to the Rescue,"" is an excallent example of creative children's literature. An excellent story for children on helping and having fun with friends while doing it. A wonderfull book tht should be read by all!"
5,Phenomenal,"Loc-a-fella Reflection Sheen Spray is ""off the chain"". It gives me such a soft, velvet, natural feel and look on my locs. It also smell supermagnificant! I love to make statments of beauty and smell with my Reflection sheen spray!"
4,Pretty Good,"I really like this book. It's not very big, but the patterns are very good quality. The little dutch windmill clock is really cute, and the Anniversary plaque is beautiful. I highly recommend this book"
4,Satisfied,"For the price I paid, what I received is way more than what I expected from my previous experiences."
4,Really liked it,"i borrowed the book from the library before purchasing to be sure I wanted to buy it for my daughter -- and find I want one for myself, too. Since I live near D.C., I particularly liked the advice about overwintering and what does well in which climate zone. It even gives advice about mini-vegetables in addition to the usual ideas about pots, what to put into them, planting, fertilizing, etc."
3,This model set is not that great,"When I got It in the mail I instantly went upstairs to put it together, but when I started to handle the small pieces I found out that this model kit is almost very fragile, some of the pieces broke on me, and the quality of this item should be more around 14 dollars not 19. I would say that you shouldn't get it for your kids as a toy, 'cause this is more of a model than a toy even though it has movable joints. Besides that, it's not all that bad of a model/toy, I'd give it a 4.5 stars out of 5"
2,Frustrating,"I know that one of the key plot devices in a romance is to keep the hero and heroine from communicating. But I think it's been way overused, in this one it was simply frustrating. I think I'm just going to lay off this kind of book for a while."
5,Their best effort,"I think that this one is their best records. it includes their best song, in my opinion, ""cry"". It's a rock-a-billy classic!!"
3,Good Game,This a game is a classic. There is no story to it at all but its fun to play. It is close to impossible to beat without a game genie.
3,Clunky but worth a try,"The main failing point of this game was the controls. Karnov moved rather slowly, and the jumps were also hard. Another annoying thing was how simply falling would cause Karnov to injure himself or die. Granted, a fall in real life did do that to people, but this was a game, and if Mario could jump and fall great distances, Karnov should be able to. This game can be rather frustrating at times, but if you learn how to deal with the control, this game is actually fairly manageable. For a NES title, this was a pretty average game, some will like it, others won't."
2,"A new edition is sorely needed, and Amazon.com's the price is high","I am writing this early December, 2002. This book is nearly 7 years old, and with the current advances in Pain Medicine, these questions are getting outdated fast. Also, [amazon.com's] price is [high] for this book, whereas other retailers are selling it for [less], probably because it is such an old book."
1,Too hot,Stay away from this one. I boiled some water in it but the handle was too hot to grab without a towel to protect my hand.
2,At least the price is right...,"It functions. It whistles loudly when water boils. The handle heats up, but not so much that I'd need a hot pad. My biggest complaint is that there is a lip inside the spout that makes it impossible to pour without spilling water. So I pour holding the cup over the sink. I've been using it for about 2 months at this writing.Considering the complaints about teakettles priced five times as much, I guess I can live with this one."
4,A scary tale of Evil and the Devil,A bad seed of a girl is born into a good family and all goes well until she turns 13 that is when she is reunited with a old Jack In The Box that her father unwittingly(?) buys in a old curio shop. The girl and the box then proceeds to wreak havoc on everybody.This book is well written and fast paced. the history of the Jack In The Box is spooky and sounds like something that could have happened in real life. As with most of his other books I can't wait until a sequel is written about further adventures of this evil Jack In The Box.If you can find a copy of this book I would recommend reading it during a nice sunny day as if you attempt to read it at night or during a thunderstorm you will have nightmares about Jack In The Boxes.
2,Students found this to be informative but not presented well,"Valuable, current information presented in a rather dull, uninteresting format according to MBA students. Very comprehensive."
1,Not a good choice,It is too small a book with limited information. Learned my lesson - small pictures cannot possibly convey artistic information as well as big ones.
3,nice pictures and text but for fans rather than experts,"the lack of floor plans of engineering drawings makes this more of a fanzine for the textile block houses. nice photos and text though. look elsewhere for informaiton useful to designers, students or architects."
4,"We love Columbia, MO","We used to live in Columbia, MO where this was filmed. It was really fun for us to see this movie two years ago at the True/False Film Festival, but we bought it because while it's extremely funny, the stories of my former townspeople really touched my heart. We all have wonderful life stories to share. Some good, some not so good, but we don't often have a chance to share them in our busy lives."
3,Not to scale!,"It's quite big and chunky, much bigger than the picture looks. I wouldn't actually wear something this heavy around my neck."
5,Excellent!,"Miller is obviously a gifted guitarist, but more importantly to those of us who purchase these DVDs for instruction, he is also a gifted teacher.With his easy going personality, he is a very likable figure, as you will spend many hours on these DVDs, revisiting the lessons repeatedly, as you learn some of the most beautiful fingerpicking songs ever composed.This two volume set, along with Homespun's DVD with Happy Traum and John Sebastian teaching the music of Mississippi John Hurt, will give you a really well rounded MJH education!You will learn the songs and those that hear you will enjoy them tremendously...even my kids sing, ""My Creole Belle""."
4,pessimistic and pretty complex in Autechre`s way,"No way it sounds like Orbital, but the album is really good. It`s rather pessimistic and pretty complex in Autechre`s way.Four stars for the whole album, five for `Toom Anys Ilverth Oughts` and `Valium`."
3,Specific to the Kindle Edition!!,"This book was recommended as a good story for young children about the Pilgrims' journey to the New World. It is a nice story, but I wish I had saved my money and bought the real book instead of the Kindle edition. The Kindle edition is poorly formatted, and the illustrations are pretty small. If you're interested in this story for your children, don't waste money on the Kindle edition!"
3,Might worth buying,"This is a very nice compilation of the famous disco group Double Exposure. All songs are very danceble. The mixer guy is Tom Moulton, which is an assurance of top dance hits. Do not forget that ""Ten Percent"" is considered the first comercial 12"" release. The version of the songs in this CD are those originally released in the LP. Also included a 12"" version of ""My love is free"". As this is an imported title, and sometimes is a little bit difficult to obtain it."
1,NO STARS!!!!Confirmed order but said they did not have the book,Please only list a book if you have it not tell me 5 days later you don't. Do not buy from this seller I am tired of buying a book then getting told it was not in stock!!!!
4,Recuperation in the tr.substations for publish transport,"I haven't red this book, but i hope that i will. I'm electrical engineer and i am post graduated in Tehnical University - Sofia. My project is about electrical recuperation in publish transport substations and i looking for more information about this problem. I hope that this book may help me."
2,Not the Best,"It's not very good if you are looking for emotional recovery. It basically tells you to just forget it and move on. Part of the emotional recovery is telling you how much better you have it than others, which isn't helpful. The exercise for post-partum recovery is helpful though."
2,Another Christian Them-vs-Us Book....,"Zender makes some interesting and telling points about mainstream evangelicalism and Catholicism, but he writes in such a cynical, self-righteous way, causing the book to lose much of its power and credibility. Its message is like so many other books of the same genre: ""I'm better than you, and understand God better than you, and I'm not going to have anything to do with you any more!"" (Sigh....)"
2,Poor Quality,"My daughter enjoyed experiencing these at her school, so I bought one for home. It broke within the second day of normal use. The ribbon detached from the cheap plastic handle, and was frayed after just an hour or two of indoor gentle use."
2,A lot Smaller than in the picture,I would not purchase this item again. It is so tiny and cheap in quality. Totally OVER PRICED! I bought it for my niece's birthday and was completely disappointed when I received it. I did not have time to return it so I gave it to her along with the other things I had to purchase at local stores.
5,Perfect ALL Metal Pet Gate,"We started with this gate and added two of the height extensions. The combination is unbeatable! Our two German Shepherds have eaten and/or jumped every gate we've tried. This gate is ALL steel with the exception of two plastic bushings which are inaccessible to the dogs. This gate beats any of the gates with plastic handles, catches, locks, etc. No more ""escapes"" from the kitchen; they don't even try anymore."
5,Durable and easy to use!,"I absolutely love this gate! I had tried the pressure gates and my bulldog learned how to throw himself at it and knock them over very easily. I have several dogs and this gate is working very well so far. It is easy to manipulate to get through, can swing both ways, and is strong enough to hold back both the small and large dogs. Also, it is wide enough to fit in the frameless doorway that I needed it for without having to buy and extender!"
3,A Wonderful book,"If you are tired of relying upon others to help you ""fix"" yourself, read this book. If you seek wisdom and are willing to accept it from History and Literature, read this book. If you see yourself as a person on a journey (pilgrimage) through life that never really ends, read this book!"
3,He's Right -- Kill Him Dead,"I read this book when it first came out in the 70s. I was impressed then and was impressed again when I read it this time. No complaints there.This is a book written by a psychotherapist for psychotherapists and patients of psychotherapy. I am neither, but there are good thoughts and things of great worth to me between these covers.The book itself, though newly printed and bound, was rather cheaply put-together. I am careful with my books, but several pages just fell out of this paperback while I was going through it. The book will not survive another reading. I don't expect paperback books to last forever, but I do want them to survive more than a single reading intact, if only for the sake of the trees they are made from."
3,It's okay!,"They said the book was in good condition. But never said it had not jacket.I would recommend the book, but makes sure you get what you wanted."
2,"A dated, introspective, and irrelevant narrative.","There are works that are timeless and apply to any generation or society. This is not one of them. It certainly cites timeless works ad nauseam, but offers nothing new or insightful. References to dated social problems and terms do little to help this. The vast majority of the rest of the work seems to me to be a tour of the author's past, from his days as a ""Hipster"", to his early days as a psychotherapist, and several patients he has worked with in his career. All that said, I will be fair and say that there /may/ be 2 pages (or 1 page, 2 sides) of thought-provoking observations by the author. There is a certain disingenuous quality to a psychotherapist writing a book whose premise is that you need neither the psychotherapist nor the book in the first place. So why write it? It does happen to further the argument that there are no answers in books...Maybe that was the purpose in the first place."
3,this is your mind on drugs,"this is an interesting book full of cultural terminology of the 70's thicker than the clouds of cannabis you smell as you read this book. occasionally there is a great insight given, but more often than not the reader is left wondering why a random story is given and to what extent did drugs take part in this books writing. buy it, it's cheap and better than most of the crap on tv, but buy it knowing ahead of time that you will be baffled and enlightened."
3,convenient way to get a book that was recommended. I have not finished it yet.,I have not read this book in its entirety yet but I am sure I will do soon as soon as I can.
3,Cover made book look very tattered,"I ordered it as a gift for my stepdad. I wanted it be able to stay on his coffee table, but the outside cover looked very tattered. I was disappointed in it. I did know it was used, but paid a high price for it so I expected it to be in better shape."
4,Great Book,I have read a few pregnancy books and this was my favorite. I like the weekly format it seemed to be very straightforward. Other books I read seemed very negative and scared me more during my pregnancy. This one did not. I highly recommenend this book.
2,"Okay, could use more detail",I purchased it because an OB/Gyn was the author but I was dissappointed. It was too brief and only touched on certain issues. I would like a more in depth book to describe a first time pregnancy.
4,good book,"This is an excellent book, but I expected more pictures. The book is well written with a lot of helpful information.Recommend"
3,It's Okay,"I purchased this book as well as the ""Pregnancy Bible"" book. This book only gives week by week plus little information afterwards. I highly recommend the ""Pregnancy Bible"" book. It gives week by week along with a picture of what your baby looks like that week. Also it gives you so much information about your pregnancy i.e. what to expect, questions to ask etc. If your looking for a 2nd reference book this could be it but if you only want one book I highly suggest splurging and buying the ""Pregnancy Bible"" by Joanne Stone & Keith Eddleman. Best wishes on your pregnancy."
3,Not my favorite,"This is my fourth child and I was bored with my old pregnancy books. This book contains good information, but the writing style seemed strange. The author seems to have some ""issues"" that I found distracting. When talking about ultrasounds she says that ""you might see your baby. . .frowning as if to say, 'You again?'"" I guess she just seems very negative about pregnancy in general.And the pictures are nice, but there are only 7 in the whole book and they are the same ones I have seen in magazines. Overall I prefer ""Your Pregnancy Week by Week."""
4,A little disappointed,"The book itself is written well. It lacked the week by week or even month by month photos that I had hoped for. I was really searching for a book that was full of photos. I already have the ""What to Expect When Your Expecting"" book. ""Pregnancy"" was too similiar to the book. Almost all the same things covered. Though I would have to say I would give ""What to Expect"" as a gift not this one. I had a miscarriage and this book didn't cover what to do if something goes wrong, ""What to expect"" does. It also doesn't cover spouses or other important peoples roles. All in all I'm still enjoying the book but it didn't meet my expectations."
5,Great book for a 1st time mom,"I really appreciated all the detail about the fetus and the expectant mom and unlike many other books, there is a chapter for each week in pregnancy."
1,Doesn't work for smart cats.,We have an infant (now toddler) in the home and wanted to ensure the cat wouldn't scratch him. It took us a while to get the cat to be still then attach... In the end we didn't put them on and the cat has yet to hurt the baby.
5,The Flame Looks So Real,Last summer I had our wood burning medal fireplace chimney removed and the fireplace capped. This left our fireplace useless. I looked at gas inserts and gas logs but didnt like the way they looked or they wouldn't fit. Then I saw this Dimplex electric in a furniture store. I was amazed how real it looked. I ordered it.It only took 3 days to come. Took it out of the box and put it in the fireplace opening and had it going in 20 minutes. It looks far better than any gas unit. The flame looks real and the embers looks great too. Guests come to the house and say it looks like a real fire. I am very happy with this unit. Thank you Dimplex and thank you Amazon.
4,Very real,This very real looking fireplace fits nicely into my fireplace opening. My cats like to sit around it so even they are fooled. My only issue is that the heating element is at the top of the unit. I was hoping it would be at the bottom. So the heat it gives off is not as much as I would have liked.
4,Warm and Clean,"We love our Dimplex Electric Fireplace. With the click of a switch we add warmth, when we want it, and fireglow to our family room. At first we found it on in the morning when we were certain we had turned it off in the evening. We learned that we needed to turn it off at the unit. Occasionally we get a vibration and just need to adjust its position.No more messy clean out of ashes, no smoke on the wall or on our paintings. It is ideal for our Arizona winters."
1,No heat,"I purchased new fireplace. The fan didn't work. The company sent a part and we put it on. The heat is so minimal, that it is not worth it. I am now considering buying something else. I really wasted my money."
2,Nice but didn't fit my need,"One reviewer mentioned that this would fit into her fuel gel fireplace and I bought it specifically for that reason based on her feedback, but the heater did not fit into my fuel gel fireplace. Now I'm not sure what to do with it.But, it is very nice and the fire looks pretty real, if it is back inside the dark encasing. You can have the ""fire"" without heat, but without the fire noise, it just doesn't have the effect you would like. I hope I can figure out how to use it."
4,Dimpolex DFI2309 Electric Fireplace,I'm very pleased with the product after a month's ownership. It gives the ambiance of a fire and is fairly realistic. The halo behind the flames it a bit symmetric and the only unrealistic visual aspect of an otherwise realistic log set. The heater fan is close to silent which is a huge plus. The minimal heat it gives off is the only disappointment. I would like more but it does warm a bit and makes for an overall satisfactory purchase.
2,The Black Ice,"The Black Ice (Harry Bosch)Having read all the Harry Bosch books I was disappointed in this offering. Like many authors, Michael Connelly has gone to the well one too many times. All the other books in this series have left me wanting more - not this time!"
4,Another good one....,This is only the 2nd connolly book I have read and I am so glad that I started. Can't wait to read more of Harry Bosch....
5,another winner,I am a big fan of the way Connelly writes and so far I have not found one book of his that doesn't keep me interested.
4,Bosch 2,"This is the second Harry Bosch novel and Connelly emerges as an expert at writing the hard-ass maverick detective with a heart. The plot has been adequately described so I don't need to recap here. Just let me add that Harry Bosch novels reveal a writer with a vivid imagination and the skill to put his character on paper in locations that come alive and facing puzzles and challenges that are engrossing. If you read the plot synopsis your reaction might be, ""Good lord, but that sounds fantastically complicated!"" And it is. But Connelly makes it work and it all comes together beautifully. If you enjoy David Robicheaux and Lucas Davenport, you will recognize Harry Bosch. I don't mean to say he's not unique and original; only that he fits this particular mold. So if you enjoy that kind of character, you'll enjoy ""Black Ice."""
2,"Disappointing, lacks depth, and a slow read","The Black Ice is the one you can leave off of the Harry Bosch ""must read"" list. The book was a chore to read, and at times, I contemplated giving up on it. It lacks any real plot or character depth. Even Bosch is not as problematic or interesting in this novel. After a slow, laborious attempt at a dual-homicide plot synthesis, the book rushes through at the end only to fall flat. I love most of Connelly's Bosch and non-Bosch books, but this is the worse of the lot. Instead, read The Black Echo if you crave vintage Bosch."
4,The Bosch Series Starts to Take Off!,"Just recently started reading Connelly and the Bosch series. The Black Echo seemed to start out slow for me and gradually became quite a thrill ride to the very end. The Black Ice, however, grabs you from the beginning and does not let go. There is rich character development, including Det Bosch and others in the LAPD, a solid if not spectacular plot and unexpected developments throughout. This is one of those books that defines ""page turner,"" as you get hooked and stay hooked.Not too long ago I read a review that suggested The Black Ice was somewhat flat compared to books #1 (The Black Echo) and #3 (The Concrete Blonde) in the series. From my perspective, the ride started gradually out of the gate with The Black Echo and has steadily, and at times quickly, gathered a full head of steam. I'm jumping right into the Concrete Blonde because I can't wait to see where Connelly takes Bosch in the subsequent books."
4,Gritty,"Connelly packs enough gunfights, blood, deceptions, and wounded bodies and egos in this pressure-cooker of a novel to satiate the reader's appetite entirely. not as taut as it could have been, but entertaining nevertheless."
5,Another superior noir by connelly...,This book was even tighter in it's execution than Black Echo. Bosch figures out a series of drug related murders and the puzzle fits nicely. Connelly jumps expertly from the FBI/Break in caper of the first novel to the DEA/drug murders of the second. Is Black Ice real? It certainly seemed to be. Bosch also continues to grow as character--as do Irving and others. A superior mystery.
1,Gave up - waste of time,"First I want to say I have DEVOURED previous Bosch books, and never been disappointed. However, this particular one was a real chore, and I gave up after 1/3 into it. Boring/tedious, hard to follow, cared nothing about any of the characters, plot (what there was of it) was uninteresting, just absolutely nothing to hold on to. I am amazed by the 5-4 star reviews!I dropped it and picked up another Bosch book - ""City of Bones"" - which is great. I was never disapppointed before in Bosch books, but guess there's a first time for everything."
5,Connelly is a master.,"Twists and turns with great characters, as always with Michael Connelly. I'm always waiting for the next book from him."
5,Just getting started on this one.,I have purchased many of the series. Try it for yourself you won't be disappointed. Buy used to save money
5,need to read,"a great read. I liked the twist and turns, it will keep you reading till the end. Can't put in down."
5,Black Ice,The book was a page turner. Harry Bosch is an interesting Homicide Detective and Michael Connelly knows how to keep the reader engaged. I have bought many of his books and have yet to be disappointed.
3,Not my favorite of the ones I've read thus far,I thought the plot moved a little slowly for my taste. Some of his other works I have liked better
3,A dark world,"In the second novel of the series, Bosch runs into Black Ice, a new drug on the street, that leads to shady cops, double crosses, a trip to Mexico and a rather predictable ending. I like the character that Connelly has created and that's why I keep coming back, but the plots are filled with way out ideas that don't seem to fit the down to earth Bosch. I find Bosch such an interesting character I keep reading these mysteries in the hopes that the mystery will fit the quality of the hero."
4,"Not quite as good as ""The Black Echo""","I didn't enjoy this book quite as much as i did ""The Black Echo"", which i thought was a stunning debut novel. However, this is still a really good book. Bosch is a great character, but at times he and his superiours attitudes toward him get so frustrating!The plot here is another good one, but to me seemed a little similar to the first. Maybe that's just because of the similarities brought ove rin Bosch's character. That's always a problem when you do a series.Nevertheless, this book has a good plot. It's exciting and tense, and Connelly's writing is gritty and evocative. He has particular talent for the descriptions of place.I would reccomend this to people who read the first one and liked it. Also, it has a really really good climax and a great twist! Definitely a high-class detective novel."
3,Excellent proceduralnovel - Bosch is the man.,"Black Ice is a good book about police work as it should be, honest forthright and uncomprimising. But unlike The Poet or Black Echo, Connelly seems to take a cheap way out, especially in his handling of Cal Moore. A short cut I am inclined to say. Still, I will be waiting for the next Bosch novel."
3,NOIR AND DULL,"The second harry Bosch novel, THE BLACK ICE, disappoints. Primarily because the character of Harry Bosch steps into the background. By that I mean the reader learns little new about loner, rebel cop Harry Bosch. That plus there is little action or conflict and thus little narrative tension. And the setting for the novel which is mainly in border Mexico is painted dull and drab and gray. Yawn. And I am a Harry Bosch fan. I plan on continuing in the Bosch series because I like the character and have hopes the author will do better. THE BLACK ICE does have a good bull fight scene and the mystery was logically, plausibly plotted. And one still gets the feeling we have a real working cop here in Harry Bosch. Not some fake fictional cop but the real thing. It is definitely noir but dull. Do better Connelly."
3,The Black Ice,"Being an avid reader, I sometimes read Detective stories for a change of pace and although this book was ok, it does not compare to John Grisham novels.(I have read all of his books) But an okay read. UPER"
