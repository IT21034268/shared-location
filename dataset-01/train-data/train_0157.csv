2,Agree with Ilana,I agree with the review by Ilana. Beloved is overrated and has been the vehicle by which English teachers from across the country have turned students away from reading. One of those indecipherable books that English teachers thrive on finding hidden meaning where none exists. A muddy piece of writing.
4,mostly good,"Beloved is a beautifully written novel. It's amazing how Morrison can make you feel all the pain, sadness, anger, happiness, and most of all, the confusion that the characters feel.Though the writing was exceptional, I found the content to be grotesque, and I admit that some parts were too graphic for my taste. Though some people may like reading books like that, I didn't. I suppose it's because I'm not used to it. I know that even though I didn't like reading it, things like that still happened.Morrison pushes controversy to the limit by putting a good spin on a heinious crime. Though she never supports nor criticizes Sethe's actions, you get the impression that Morrison approved of Sethe's decision to kill her daughter. Sethe, after all, is the protagonist.Morrison is excellent at what she does, and though I didn't love the book, I would recommend it."
3,"Poignant, but very confusing","At first, this book was addicting. Halfway through, new characters and themes were introduced without ample explanation, leaving me wondering ""Did I miss something??"". I may have indeed missed something. Perhaps I lack the intelligence needed to understand this book. The parts I did understand I found were quite poignant and mysterious. I'm currently struggling through the last 60 pages or so. I skim-read the last page and I know it's poignant, but the journey there has been long and confusing."
3,"Pretty good, but not the best!","Beloved contains a subject that Morrison has not dealt with before: slavery. While the novel has been controversial, Morrison has been honest and unflinching in her look at the effects of slavery and a mother's love for her children. Beloved certainly deserves the acclaim it has received. However, I do not believe that this novel is Morrison's best.As someone who has read five Morrison novels in the past four months, perhaps this review won't be completely fair. Beloved is well-written and original, but I am not sure that it lives up to it's reputation. I am well-aware that if a person were to pick up any Morrison novel, they would probably read this one first. But I also hope that they would read her other works after. I do think that this is a terrific novel, but I also think that her other works deserve just as much acclaim, if not more."
5,Great transaction,"Great transaction, fast shipping. If you haven't read the book, it's worth the ""trouble"" because it has such a powerful message."
3,Beloved,"I first read this book my Junior year in High School. I am 23 now, and till this day I am still affected by it.In ""Beloved"" by Toni Morrison we are taken through the life of Sethe, an former slave from Ohio who is being haunted by a destructive spirit. This spirit, who is known as Beloved, makes life difficult for her and the rest of the family. But Sethe finds comfort in the ghost who is the spirit of her dead baby. The baby was never given a name.I found ""Beloved"" to be a hard read at times, but it was a masterpiece all the same. Toni Morrison, knows how to paint pictures with words. Every detail, every account, and every haunting moment of this story stays with you in a way that is undescribable.As an African American woman, I was vividly taken back in time by this book. What I didn't learn about slavery I felt the agony of it, and what my ancestors went through.""Beloved"" is truly a timeless tale."
5,Lived up to it..,"Walter Huston and Barbara Stanwyck. Their acting leaves nothing to want. The story does not fit them, but they make a great film out of it. I consider this, one of the best Westerns in my library."
5,"Watchmaker Loupe, 5X","Our family has history of ""watchmaking"" and has always had eye loupes available for troublesome little fixes--such as a sticker in a finger or foot. I LOVE the little eye-piece magnifier. I plan to get my children these for stocking stuffers! Thank you Santa!"
4,"Good book, incredible at that price","Interesting information and good photos. It is not updated by 2012. The selection of cars can be a source of discussion but is a good book, excellent for the price ($2.49)."
5,Simple and Essential Message,"This wonderful book may be simple and predictable, but it gives children the essential message that you love them no matter what. I own this book and am buying another for a nephew. It has a special place in my heart as a remember reading it at bedtime snuggled up with my children when they were toddlers.Yes, we all should know that we are loved no matter what, but it never hurts to hear it again. And again. And again."
3,"It's ""ok""","I think the idea of this book is good, but I feel like the book is lacking something. But it is a cute idea."
1,Bad Mistake,"By the way, I'm not ""John"" obviously, but we can't figure out how to change the name. Anyway, I'm Charlene. I should have know better than to buy a bra recommended by Oprah Winfrey! This extremely expensive minimizer was fine on the first couple of days, then it started to gap in front between the cups with the ends of the underwires poking through my shirts. Eventually (2-3 weeks later) the fabric in the back started to separate. And it didn't even do a good job minimizing. There are much better alternatives out there, much more reasonably priced."
1,Pear Shaped,This bra constricted my breasts at the top and created an odd pear shape. Not at all flattering for those with breasts that are full on top.
5,Absolutely hands down the best bra ever!!,I purchased one of these bras from a local department store after being fitted to it and positively choking over the $65 price tag...but it was worth it for one of them. Was delighted to find them online Amazon for a far more reasonable $38. I am large busted and have a hard time finding a bra with a good fit that doesn't constantly require fiddling with to remain comfortable. This bra is fabulous and worth every penny and even looks nice!
5,EXCELLENTE - BOW-WOW,"Scout dogs and their handlers saved countless numbers of soldiers' lives thru watching for booby traps, searching for injured troops, finding enemy bunkers and learning of approaching enemy. The Viet Cong actually promised hefty bounties for the dogs. In between battles and patrols, they were great companions for the soldiers. During the war, there were about 10,000 handlers assigned with their faithful canines but there was no homecoming for the dogs - they were left to fend for themselves or be killed in combat (or ending up on a Viet Nam menu). The book listed the handlers and dogs killed in the war - one handler was awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism in Hau Nghia Province in 1969. These parts of the war needed to be told and Burnam did a good job in letting us know. For any dog owner, this is a good read but be ready for sadness in several chapters."
2,Very enlightening about the Vietnam war and the dogs that served.,"I was anti the Vietnam war, but felt embarrassed by the way we treated the 'returning.Veterans. What happened to the dogs is a disgrace."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I ordered this in a Medium (size 8 to 10) and it just barely fits my 47"" 50lb. almost seven year old. The dress is short, especially after you tie on the skirt. (I know Tinkerbell is supposed to have a shorter skirt, but she shouldn't be showing off her underwear.) The wings are nice and big, but flop and twist around.It is cute, but not once my daughter starts to move at all. The dress starts to get shorter and the seam around the waist of the dress shows over the tied on skirt. I'm going to attempt sewing the tie on skirt to the dress to keep this from happening. I'm also going to have to do something to tack down the wings. Hopefully, I can fix it enough for my daughter to wear at her birthday party.The way it is, it would work better for playing dressup.Regardless, My daughter loves this outfit. She danced around like a ballerina she tried it on."
3,Not scratchy???,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer, the dress is far too short for an 8 year old. I bought the size 8-10 for my quite tall 5 years old. She loved it! The dress is slightly bigger than it should be, which means she still has room to grow, but it would have never fit my 8 year old.I agree that the wings are not steady. They move around a lot and she has to wear them upside down to have some sort of control over it.As for the advertised ""not scratchy"" fabric, I am sorry, but that is not true, actually my child wanted to take it off, because (I quote)it is ""TOO SCRATCHY!!! MOM I WANNA TAKE IT OFF!!"" The problem was solved with a green t-shirt under the costume, so she was able to stand wearing the dress, but still... If it is adevertized as not scratchy, I would expect some sort of credibility...All the same, my daughter loves it and is enjoying her present. Just remember to buy it for younger kids, so that it has a decent life span."
4,Works well,"Nice and big, fits over my 5 ft tall lime tree. Pretty light so doesn't weight down on the plant as much as say a sheet does."
5,Protecter,It is just what I needed to protect against the wind and cold and not have to remove until danger of freezes are gone.
1,This product is junk!,"Does not protect plants from ""light freeze"" as indicated on package. Florida resident, low temp last night 32 degrees. Each of three plants covered with this product suffered freeze damage ranging from major to minor. Don't be fooled as I was. This product is total, complete, absolute junk! Manufacturer says customer can return product for refund within 30 days if dissatisfied. Of course, to be prepared for cold weather, one must buy prior to inclement weather. Unless you're God, how do you know when first cold weather will occur. You will probably have purchased this product more than 30 days before its first use. To reiterate, this product is garbage. The manufacturer is misrepresenting the effectiveness of its product."
1,very light frost....and they've died!,"Sooooooooooo disappointed!!! Went through the expense and the thorough covering of my 2 avocado plants, and one mango...all has died, and it was a very light frost only for a couple of hours for 2 nights. I expected so much more!!!"
2,Huh?,"This has to be the most rediculous bond movie ever made. Quality, etc. of the product itself is OK but the movie just doesn't flow or make sense."
2,Disappointing,"I thought that this movie was disappointing, although Lazenby wasn't as bad as some people make him out to be. It was too long, and the casting of Telly Savalas is a puzzlement to me. The only thing I liked about this movie was Diana Rigg. She is great."
2,It was ok,"From the other reviews that I have been reading, I disagre. Sure, I admit the movie had a good plot and good characters, but Lazenbe was definatly the wrong choice. If they had chosen someone else, anyone else, this Bond film would have been consitered a great Bond as Dr. No, or Gold Finger. Good ol' George was so bad, and unbilevible as Bond, they would not let him to do another one.(A disision in which I agree!!) The producers also made a bad choice with Timithy Dalton, but that is another review."
2,One of the Worst Bonds,"Great story ruined by the inclusion of Lazenby as the legendary spy. Even worst is the replacement of Donald Pleasance by Telly Savallas as Blofeld. The cold sinister performance of Pleasance is here reduced to the coarse persona of Kojak. This is without a doubt one of the most forgetable Bond actors and films along with Timothy Dalton's horrible last installment, 'License To Kill'."
4,60's Bond at it's best...,"It may not be Connery but it's a must-own for even the mildest admirer of Bond films. Lazenby is smooth, quiet, not overly animated, but fits the bill the perfectly in my opinion. The style, music, characters, suspense, romance and action are all of classic 60's spy campiness. And as mentioned in other reviews, the scenery and camera work are excellent.As you will see by watching it, Kojak is also quite the skier, as well as a brilliant mad scientist set on taking over the world."
4,Good movie. . .,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service would have been a great movie- if it was a bit shorter, and it didn't have a sad ending... oh well, don't want to spoil it for you. Also, I hated the jarring camera angles. In fights, and other exciting scenes, the camera angle will change about 5 times in 5 seconds.The movie is really exciting. A lot of people will love the ski and car chase through the alps, which takes about 1/2 hour. Other great scenes are the bobsled chase, and the fight at the beach at the beginning.It's a great movie- if you have a lot of time."
4,One of the Best Bonds,"After sitting through the dreadful ""Live and Let Die"" last weekend, ""OHMSS"" looks better all the time, though it's a bit overlong. I'm grateful that George Lazenby was 007 in this particular effort rather than appearing in subsequent Bond films (which were mostly forgettable except for Connery's return in ""Never Say Never Again""). In fact, the series should have ended after the Lazenby film."
3,On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"The much-maligned George Lazenby is actually quite good in this Bond installment, humorous and clever, generous in scenes with the alluring Diana Rigg, surely the most intelligent and witty Bond Girl in all of the filmed spy capers. Telly Savales is a confident villain who refuses to lose, resulting in the shockingly brutal drive by shooting that ends the movie."
4,It came on time,I had never seen james bond like this before. It was the ultimate in orginal movies. A must see. It gave me a sight in to all the other that came after.
4,Long last,At long last a DVD of On Her Majesty's Secret. Great quality. Now my 007 DVD collection is complete. I am very satisfied with shopping at Amazon.com. Personally believe this was the best James Bond filmed.
4,George Lanzenby did great,"Although George Lanzenby only played James Bond once, he did a great job in ""On her Majesty's Secret Service"". The film has good acting and amazing action sequences. Diana Rigg does a phenomenal job as ""Tracy Bond"", the only woman to have actually married James Bond. Blofeld is well performed by Terry Savalas. I really enjoyed Lanzenby as Bond and I wish he had done more. This is truly a fantastic movie and one of the best James Bond films."
4,What was the point?,"Lazenby played the part of Bond very well. The lame part of this movie is that you can tell that they are really pushing multiculturalism probably to make it fit with the new Bond (a brown British?). Lazenby was only in one Bond film, so what really was the point if you are not going to be in it for the long haul? They just made a bad choice as to what actor was going to be Bond."
5,Most underrated Bond movie - great extras too,"This surely ranks as one of the most underrated James Bond movies ever released. The plot comes directly from the Ian Fleming book and this wise choice shows as it is positively crackling with suspense while including romantic interludes. Accomplished actors Telly Savalas and Diana Rigg make up for the amateur George Lazenbys lack of talent and Ms. Rigg is simply stunning in her role as a Countess. This movie features some solid direction by veteran 007 editor Peter Hunt and there is a nice screen specific optional audio commentary here by the director and quite a long informative dcoumentary on the production of the movie, full of facts that I, as a self proclaimed James Bond nut, did not even know."
4,another great bond movie,"the only movie by lazenby,Australian actor, as apparently women cast did not enjoy working with him, plenty of action,chasing,bullets, another great Bond movie, i am big James Bond fan, loved it."
5,DVD Bond,"I think this is one of the better Bond movies. I was surprised that Lazenby only did the one movie. He was no Sean Connery but he did a credible Bond. The story was well written and exciting for the time it was done. There seems to be more ""Flash-Bang"" in the later Bonds and not carried by the character as intended by Ian Flemming.Chas E. Moser"
5,Oh Her Must Have Collection,"People seem to hate George Lazenby, and so they hate Oh Her Majesty's Secret Service, but actually he is a very good Bond maybe people weren't ready for him because Connery created 007 in the last 5 films, O.H.M.S.S. was more true to Bond, he didn't need half the gadgets he was given in the past films, Lazenby also sounded like what James Bond should sound like, and of course ut has hot 007 girls and Telly Savalas played Blofeld fantastically. overall, no one can replace Sean Connery, but he is better much better than Roger Moore."
1,Good?! You call this good?!,"Many consider this movie the best in the series. Of these people, how many bothered to watch the film? OHMSS is painful to watch. It takes over an hour for anything to happen. George Lazenby is not bad in his only Bond appearance, but he can't save a terrible movie. Blofeld has built a research center in the Alps. I won't reveal the plot, but then again, it's almost not worth writing. Telly Savales as Blofeld is by far the worst. He's just not menacing. George Lazenby is the worst Bond. If you want to see a good Bond, watch any Roger Moore film, the best being The Spy who Loved Me, which also happens to be the best in the series, followed closely by Goldfinger. All in all, OHMSS is hardly worth the time it takes to watch it, although the music is quite good."
1,"Lazenby, You're No Sean Connery","The last Bond movie I saw. I'd seen the others, most of them years ago and many when they first came out. Then I saw this.....this.....this....whatever it is. It was terrible, absolutely terrible.For starters, George Lazenby is just not Sean Connery - even 40 years later, he's not Sean Connery. The movie features a number of one-liners that misfire, a barely discernible plot, a lousy Bond, a decent car, and the one bright moment: Telly ""Kojak"" Savalas as Blofeld. The tough guy tries to off Bond and - to point out another monstrosity of this movie - there are WAY too many snow skiing scenes, including the last one where Blofeld is caught on the limbs of an overhanging tree while competing against Jamaica in the bobsled event.This movie was - bar none - the WORST Bond ever made. I don't know that one could be made that is worse. Seriously. Although they certainly tried it the very next go around."
1,You Should at Least See the Ending,Pretty much bored until the end. It surprised me. The whole sequence of the marriage and then the after effect was very well done. It pulled at my heart-strings.
4,"""THIS NEVER HAPPENED TO THE OTHER GUY,""","deapans George Lazenby in the opening momemts of the 6th Bond entry. Peter Hunt's telling of the tale not only lampoons the Bond epics, it harpoons it: Bond whistling the ""Goldfinger"" theme as he's led into Draco's office the best example. But OHMSS has the classic Bond elements in tact: Great locations, the beautiful people, intense action. Telly Savalas was a natural playing a heavy and Diana Rigg radiates the screen. Englebert Humperdinck should have sang ""We Have All The Time In The World."""
4,Classic Bond,A little hokey in places but that's the point. Classic 60's Bond. It's unfortunate that George Lazanby wasn't given the opportunity to continue in the role after Sean Connery's brief return. George was much more believable as Bond than Roger Moore ever was.
5,My favorite Bond film of all....,"I was in high school when I first saw ""On her Majesty's Secret Service"", and fell in love with the music,the story, and George Lazenby. I don't care what anyone else thinks, this has always been my favorite Bond film, and it is at the top of my list, and will always be at the top. I have a short list that I love best- Goldfinger, Thunderball, Dr.No, To Russia with Love, but OHMSS takes top billing every time. The ending has always been hearbreaking to me, and no matter how many times I see it, it still is. This is the way Bond films should be. If you would like to see a Bond film with a real love story, hear a score that will haunt your dreams and stay in your memory, enjoy thrilling snow chases and see a Bond that is just drop dead gorgeous- this is the Bond for you."
2,The worst Bond film I've seen (sad but true),"After growing up on the Bond films I decided recently to rewatch the series on DVD, especially in light of the bonus materials available. I just watch ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" last night and I can't believe some of you think so highly of it. By far it had the worst acting, the worst camera work, the worst editing, the worst writing, the worst stunts, the cheapest-looking sets, and one of the the most boring plots of any Bond movie I've seen so far (I've rewatched about 3/4 of them). Lazenby was completely unbelievable as Bond to the point where, in combination with all the other factors I just mentioned, I almost turned the movie off after the first 30 minutes. In short, watching this movie is like being forced to eat a rubbery burger at a fine steak house."
2,Pretty good story but RIUNED by Lazenby,"All in all it was an alright story line. It might have been in my top 10 if it was connery, moore,brosnan or mabe even dalton. I am sorry but lazenby should stick to modeling. He riuned this film for me. He couln't pull off the role. Models just cant act smart or cunning i guess. It not a good movie probably worst one in whole colection. THeir are facts to prove this too such as the fact that OHMSS barely made a profit and by far grossed the least amount of money.Over all not a good movie my ranking of bonds hast to go.1. Connery (Great bond absolutly fantastic,great in every movie)2. brosnan (Very good bond, although it was obvious that he was not used to and very nervous about the role in Goldeneye)3. Moore (Hard to believe sometimes but he did make the best bond film ever- the spy who loved me)4. Dalton (he was alright in the living daylights)5. Lazneby (horrible not a wonder why he only did one film)"
3,review of the DVD transfer,"Disappointing. This is my favorite Bond film, but the music accompanying the special features menu shows up the flatness of the mono soundtrack. It's now advertised as out-of-print; I hopethis deficiency is corrected in the re-release. Diana Rigg is noticably absent from the Making Of documentary."
3,Overrated!,"There is one great twist in the movie that is different than any other bond film. That is why it has been considered by many as the best bond film. The twist is good and different. If you haven't guessed yet, critics love things that are different not neccsarily entertaining. The rest of the movie was slow paced, but it had good action sceans. This is the real deal."
5,The Unknown 007,"When Australian model George Lazenby replaced the irreplaceable Sean Connery, he was given what is one of the best, if not the best, script in any of the 007 adventures. Lazenby does a good job as the suave secret agent and his love interest, Teresa, is portrayed fabulously by Diana Rigg. For anyone who loves Bond flicks but have skipped this one because it isn't Connery, Moore, or Brosnan, you're missing out. Unlike the stereotypical Bond, Lazenby's falls in love, gets married, and then is forced into a situation due to a broken heart. I highly recommend this film."
5,"if you don't like this one, your not a bond fan!","o.h.m.s.s. is truly one of the best bond films ever made! it has great action, a good story, and a good villan. whats unique about this film is it had a differebt bond (played by george lazenby) and the fact that bond gets married! he marries the beautyfull diana rigg, to bad for the heartbreaking ending. this is truly one of my favorite bond films ever!"
3,The only thing missing is Bond,"Far from the worse Bond film - ""Moonraker"" wins that dubious distinction, hands down - this one remains my favorite non-Connery episode. Top flight action sequences, good performances (I don't know I kind of dug Telly as Blofeld - ""Head him at the precipice indeed), good tunes, killer locales, hot (if somewhat under-utilized babes), and did I mention the action sequences? Really, the only thing missing is the man himself. This is particularly apparent at the end, when the required gravitas is decidely missing in action. Lazenby, good in the action sequences, was far too stiff in the clinches - both dramatic and romantic - so the director wisely focused on the ski chases, car chases, etc... But.... you know, had he not killed his own career, Ol' George just might have worked out. After all, he couldn't have been any worse than what's followed!"
2,Ok but could do better for OHMSS,This Bond is my least favorite. Poor George got a bad Bond to start and sank.
2,I hate this film!!!!!,"I read an Amazon review for this movie that said, ""If you don't like this film, you are not a Bond fan"" That is a bunch of crap. The two times I've attempted to watch this film, I dosed off!!!!! It totally destroys the Bond formula! Come on, who did they think they were kidding, Bond gets married?!?!?!?! Don't make me laugh. I thought the Bond character was supposedly a loner. In my opinion, this film should have never been made. Has anyone seen ""The James Bond Story""? Even Lazenby says he hates the film. If you're a Bond fan stop kidding yourself and admit that the movie sucked, just try to shake it off........"
1,worst bond ever,"thought id give george lasenby a chance but he stunk. Was not worth my time poorly made. No spy gadgets or q in this movie, not very bond plus bond gets married in this movie which is not supposed to happen. not really georges fault but this movie fails as even entertaining"
1,Worst Bond Ever!,"I have all the Bond flicks. It's really amazing that anyone likes this one. Laz is just not up to any of the other 007s. The acting is so-so.... If you're a collector, buy it. If you are looking for true Bond action, there are so many that are soooo much better than this wimp noodle."
1,GOD THIS STUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This video had almost NO PLOTand George Lazenby wasen't really Bond the way he's supossed be viewed as. I didn't think Lazenby was suave, or cool. There wasn't much action so all it really was was Bond walking around talking to people. I suggest renting this movie BEFORE you buy it."
1,THE WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF 007,I want to help anyone who is about to buy this movie on Video and DVD and Laser disc.George recked the film on it's road to fame. With his bad looks and his sence of humor. I almost got it. But then I saw it I won't tell you the ending. BECAUSE IT IS NO GOOD AND IT'S AN INBERISMENT TO THE SERIES GEORGE IT THE WORST BOND [ACTER!]
2,Pretty bad,"Okay I am a huge 007 fan. But come on people!!! Lazenby sucked! He proved that Bond should never be smug. Connery was Arrogant and Moore was Self Satisfied,but Lazenby's smugness made this movie BAD!!!!!!! If Connery had done this one it would have been my favorite. I gave this movie 2 stars because Diana Rigg and Telly Salvalas did awesome. It stuck to the Fleming novel so that was good. One more bad thing is that this is the longest bond film. It about 2hours and 22minutes. Also the Film just kinda dragged on too. If you want to wacth airhead lazenby ruin a great movie,GO AHEAD. I would suggest any other bond movie than this."
4,One of the best Bond movies.,"At about 140 minutes, this is one of the longest Bond films, and I remember thinking it was a bit too long. But when watching it again I don't think it was. It has action, character development and humour (including one of the best one liners, ""He had a lot of guts!""). George Lazenby's performance is good. He doesn't get as many closeups and isn't as charming as Connery's Bond, but with the help of the script, he adds depth to the character. It would have been interesting to see what direction the Bond series would have taken if he hadn't quit. Telly Savalas is a good Blofeld, and Irma Bunt is a great henchman/woman, who reminds me of Rosa Klebb in From Russia With Love. Unfortunately, she died just after the movie was released and couldn't reprise the role. On Her Majesty's Secret Service is, despite one of the least seen, one of the best Bond films. 4+"
5,One of the top 5 Bond movies...,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service ranks up there with the best Bond movies. Skyfall, Casino, Goldfinger, From Russia...maybe Goldeneye of course also being up there"
3,A bit too glam for me....,"I pre-ordered this book and waited with great anticipation, being a big fan of Lora Brody's other cookbooks. I plan to try a few of the recipes but I was, overall, a bit disappointed with the content; only 3 chicken recipes but 7 for duck? And several recipes involve ingredients I've never seen (even living in 3 large cities); cipollini onions, anyone? The techniques used look very good; none of that old method of tossing all ingredients in the crockpot here. I'm definitely interested in the author's recipes that involve putting your crockpot insert into the oven or microwave, since I've never tried either. I have a feeling that most of these recipes may not appeal to my family of six, but perhaps this was never the author's intention. If she wanted to venture to the opposite end of the culinary spectrum from usual crockpot recipes, she certainly succeeded."
4,Finally!,"Finally, a slowcooker cookbook with recipes that sound GOOD! I have been valiently trying to find some recipes that appeal to me(and yes i tried the Rick Rodgers book -- those recipes required way too much work) and this book has 'em! I agree with the reviewer before me that there are too many duck recipes, but every cookbook has plenty of things to skip over. This book has carmelized onions and ideas for using them, baked garlic, again with ideas for using it, hummus, several recipes for dried beans & lentils, risotto,scallops, lamb, and stocks in addition to stews, brisket, and deserts. It works for me!"
3,Sounds Good - But turns out to be disappointing,"... I was excited to find a slow cooker book that did not use canned soup or onion soup mix and was willing to put put in some extra prep time up front for a superior meal.While I greatly enjoyed browsing through the book, I found actually using it to produce hit and miss results. So far the score is Hits-1, Misses - 3. Extremely disappointing given the amount of time I invested in prep work. I have found several misprints e.g. cook on high, instead of low; incorrect measurments for ingredents, which definitly contributed to the poor results.A large percentage of the recipes are for duck which we don't eat. Given I fell ""victim"" to the missprints in the chicken and beef recipes, I don't have the confidence to swap other items for the duck.This book may be wonderful for very experienced cooks who require a recipe only to obtain a bit of inspiration but it was a disappointment for me."
5,Great,"The best in this arena. Try the lamb shanks and you will be in heaven, feasting on the sunshine of Provence."
1,UNTESTED DISASTER?,"I just threw out an entire 6-qt recipe for New England Boiled Dinner. I followed the recipe exactly, although I had an uneasy feeling about her instructions to cook this corned beef dish for 12-16 hours on high heat. My suspicions were born out as the recipe absolutely destroyed the meal I had planned for tonight. I cooked it overnight or I might have realized it was done way before 12 hours. When I woke up to an entire house full of the stench of food verging on burnt I knew immediately. I looked at the recipe again to be sure I hadn't mis-read her instructions. Twice in the recipe she says to cook for 12-16 hours on high. Use this book at your own peril. I have other books by Lora Brody and have never had a problem, but this one must have not been checked for timing. Who knows what else might be wrong with the recipes."
4,Good recipes,"There are alot of good recipes in this book, and the organization is well done. The only minus (or plus) is there's a big focus on chestnuts. They seem to be in half the recipes."
3,I really wanted to like this book....,"I recently bought a crockpot and have spent a lot of time on Amazon.com's website looking at crockpot recipe books. From what I can gather from reviews, there are two basic types of recipe books: 1) those that use a lot of prepared ingredients like frozen vegetables, canned soups, salad dressings etc. as time-savers, and 2) those that involve more cooking ""from scratch"" using a crockpot instead of the stove.This book falls into the second category, which is what I was looking for. But I sent the book back for a refund and I'm only giving it 3 stars because the book description says the author ""pushes the slow cooker to places no one ever expected it to go..."" There are recipes that are more exciting and I want to acknowledge them, but there are too many simplistic recipes: chicken stock, vegetable stock, black beans, slow cooked chickpeas, black bean dip, 2 types of mashed potatoes. I think the book description just made too strong a claim for this book."
1,buyer be warned,"i collect cookbooks and do a lot of experimenting with recipes. every dish i've made from this book has had a strange, unappetizing flavor. i've just ruined a $30 piece of lamb, so i don't plan to cook from this book again."
2,Good cookbook if you eat like a gourmet every night,"This cookbook was not good in my opinion at all, unless you are a gourmet cook, eat like one every night and have your pantry stocked with exotic foods. If you're looking for a cookbook to make your life easier with ""everyday"" type foods, this is NOT it. However, if you eat rabbit, duck or lamb on a regular basis, you will love this cookbook. There were only a few recipes that included foods such as a beef roast and chicken."
5,good cookbook,This is such a good cookbook and is one I have been borrowing from the library for years so it was time to just buy it. Lora Brody writes really wonderful cookbooks. I would recommend it to everybody.
5,Castle of the Pearl,"Had to take part in this self-discovery book for a psych class at my university. I found it to be such an amazing tool, one that opened doors. I intended to use it to its fullest extent and although hesitant, I found it to be the most helpful tools in self discovery that I have ever seen. I have refered the book to many (10, or better) and because it is out of print, have found a clean copy and took it upon myself to have several copies made so that others may reap the same benefits I have. I still have yet to finish because the places it has taken me have been so amazing I'm taking my time experiencing them. Too bad there aren't more self-discovery books like this one!"
3,My mom has had these for over 20 years,"So I took a chance and ordered myself a pair... They are not made like they used to be! After only a few wearings, the sole had worn down! I guess they are not made for someone who walks a lot. Cute shoes though"
3,Minnetonka Thunderbird Smooth Moccasin,"The Minnetonka shoes I ordered are okay. However, the toe part of the left shoe points out some to the left rather than to the right where the big toe is, which is how shoes are suppose to be shaped. I think this pair was just not shaped as they should have been. However, they are comfortable and wear okay, and hopefully, as I wear them I hope the toe part will re-shape. I've just never seen a pair of Minnetonka shoes do this before. If I had known, I may would not have ordered them."
2,Not as good as I had hoped.,They are really rough and the loop from the knot on top really rubs the skin raw. Even if wearing light socks it still is abrasive.
1,Just... What on earth.,"Recieved these as a gift from my dear mother. My face said thank you, but my mind said da HECK. Copious amounts of gross."
5,Classic and Perfect,"I bought this exact pair of shoes on a trip to Michigan 5 years ago, and the only indication that they were well-loved was the subtle graying of the laces; the leather and soles held up great! When my new puppy chewed one up, I immediately bought a new pair. They are an incredible bargain and seem to go along with everything! I did get a few blisters while breaking them in, as well as a strange under-the-big-toe scraping, but it's well worth it for the years of use I'll wear out of them."
5,"Minnetonka Thunderbird, Ice","They're perfect! Sizing was right; cute as ever. Just like those I had when I was a kid.The sole is hard rubber or vinyl, with ridges, if anyone wants to know. Love them!"
5,Great,I could not find these for my mother-in-law in her size anywhere. Found them on Amazon in her size and ten dollars cheaper than in the local stores.
4,comfy boat shoe,"While I have owned a few pair of Minnitonka moc's over the years I knew the product would be comfortable, and they are.The style of the Thunderbird is great for casual wear and look good with shorts or jeans. There is very little, if any support in this style so be aware of that if you are looking for a walking shoe.My one disappointment was a flaw in one of the shoe. The threading around the top was seperated and with very little effort would have destroyed the entire shoe. I had to send them back. Don't let that be a negative because the shoe itself is well worth the price."
3,"Sometimes great, sometimes boring","For those of you who may not know it, GAMMA RAY is Kai Hansen's band. And Kai Hansen was the brain behind HELLOWEEN, the band the practically ""invented"" european power / melodic metal, with the albums KEEPER OF SEVEN KEYS I and II, back in 1988. AFter that, Hansen left the band due to commercial pressures upon him, and formed Gamma Ray.This double set is good at sometimes, but listening to it back to back may be a little bit annoying, due to the sheer speed of a lot of the songs and that usual double kick drumming all the way.... Also, Hansen is not a singer at all. He's a guitarist that sings. That's very different.Anyway, the re-recorded songs sound good and improved."
4,Not for beginners of labanotation,"I am a dance teacher in a NYC public school but we do some pretty sophisticated stuff. I must memorize the choreography or try to notate it in my little haphazard way. Anyway I always wanted to learn the Laban technique so I researched and came up with this book. It is quite complicated. I think I will finally learn it but it will take me forever. I think Laban is fascinating so I do recommend it. Take you time though, it's grueling. I have to take class."
3,the hole on doesn't match,the hole from the castle nut doesn't match with the hole on the bolt the hole was made on a bad angle you have to be playing with it until you get it inn
3,worked,control arm was a fine replacement for 97 acura cl. the nuts seemed a bit cheap. the treads on one of the kingnuts actually gave way. i just used the old nuts that came off the car. the rest of the construction was fine.
4,The Lemonade Trick by Scott Corbett,"You might not have heard about a lemonade trick and magic mix,but in this book you will.Kerby Maxwell isn't a neat person but he's not as bad as he seems.Also you migth think this book is boring but when youre in an exciting part you'll like to read more and more and more about the story.This kid meets this old woman and she,gave him a chemistry set,but when he mixes it and gets near,oh no.....I liked this book because it's interesting and emotional.The author gives examples so you would understand perfectly.Also because I didn't know some of the words and now I do and you'll learn new words too.He also describes how Kerby is feeling and everybody else too.I haven' read a book as interesting and remarkable as this book."
2,Its really fun to read.,Its wellwritten and funny.my favorite part of the book was when kerby got his chemistry set.Also when kerby hit bumpson the head with his sword.Kerby bent bump hat.
4,Very Good Home Receiver,I hooked to up to my 5.1 speakers and sounded very clear. The separation of instruments between the fron effect speaker is WOW. My systems is still not as good as a Yamaha RX-V1 which my close friend has. His system is awsome.
4,"construction material, methods & techniques",this is the book at that is needed for a class I am taking. The book arrived in plenty of time and was in great condition.
4,"A classic, sort of","This debut LP from Penetration is hard to pin down. It has punk elements (evidenced by covers of the Buzzcocks' ""Nostalgia"" and Patti Smith's ""Free Money), but had a sound closer to new wave. The songs are consistently strong, but rarely as brilliant as the best groups they emulate. The band avoids cliches of romantic, commercial rock, but the lyrics have never been particularly strong or innovative.MOVING TARGETS doesn't exactly capture the band's live electricity, but is a competent rendering of the Penetration at their most creative and consistent. The vocals of Pauline Murray solidify and give distinction to the sound. Best of all, you can still listen to these songs long after other bands have become passe."
3,Almost unbelievable,"This book is good for a quick read, but it didn't thrill me. The characters' stories were too conviently linked. Although I will suspend my belief in reality for a book, I just wasn't able to get wrapped up enough to truly get lost in the story and its characters."
2,Convoluted,"I listened to this audio book becuase it was lying around. It wasn't inspiring or enlightening. Too many characters and plot twists leave the reader wondering who is who and what is going on. It would have been more interesting if it was real. As one who hasn't read any other books by the author, my viewpoint stands in a vacuum. The ending seems trite and fumbles for closure."
1,"Boy, that's my last temptation to read a Val McDermid book","Pretty boring book. After about the first chapter I wondered if it would get any better. It didn't. Half way through I wanted to give up, but things were just starting to move, so I didn't.I couldn't get past the fact that it all was so contrived, with the profiler magically pulling predictions about the criminal out of thin air. Definitely not worth the read. If you find that you're not really believing the characters after the first chapter or two, bail out. Read something else."
3,good read,will read more of hers. she has a lot of them. now i am just filling space until the submit button turns up.
1,Typomania,"Whatever you do don't buy this book on Kindle. I have managed to plow through some free kindle books that I loved despite their typos. This book was impossible. Oh, well. Off to the library"
5,What a ride!,"Val McDermid grabs you and doesn't let go. He takes you on a trip that keeps your interest, wondering and, of course, your attention doesn't waver. He keeps the unsuspected end to the end. I did not put it down until I finished the book. A Good One!"
4,Great Fun in a Amazing Spanish Horror Film,"One of the most interesting spanish filmmaker is Alex De la Iglesia. His first movie (Acción Mutante) was a great success in Spain, but his second one is much better. Day of the Beast (El Día de la Bestia) is a real horror and comedy experience, the crazy vehicle from the director to show his bizarre and sarcastic humor. I recommend rent, or buy, this picture in his original version, with subtitles in english. By this way, you can enjoy with the perfects performances from Alex Angulo, like a priest who search the antichrist in Christmas in Madrid, and the great Santiago Segura, like a funny death metal fan who help the religious. A great film."
1,this VHS is dubbed into English,A great movie that is ruined by English dubbing. Unfortunately this movie in unavailable in the US in the original Spanish language with English subtitles. What a tragedy.
2,Didn't actual view it,"I must have brought this up on my computer, but I didn't view it or I may have opened and closed it."
2,"Item says ""New"" but its really ""used""","I purchased this item for Ray Lewis memorabilia. This item says ""New"". When i received it in the mail, the paper game box was bent and it showed sticker residue on it, showing stickers were took off. The actual game box itself and game is brand new but not the the outside box. I was expecting the whole thing to be brand new. Not ""used"""
1,Breaks easily,"This sink came installed in my new home. I was here at Amazon looking for a replacement. This sink was broken with only 2 years of moderate use. It failed where the faucet attaches to the sink. The sink has broken completely and the faucet is hanging in the holes. This sink was professionally installed. It turns out the material the sink is made from is 1/16"" plastic.While the drain area was a nice feature (I kept a scrub brush there) a better feature would be a sink that doesn't break. Unless you want to be shopping for another sink in a few years or enjoy either paying a plumber or installing sinks yourself, I'd pass on this sink and get something more substantial."
1,Quickly self destructs,The plastic polymer used to make this sink needs to be changed. It is of the type that cracks easily under stress and temperature fluctuations. I have had mine for almost 8 hears now and it sees pretty regular use out in our garage. It developed cracks early on the bottom of all places which I had to seal with marine grade epoxy underneath. The shiny finish disappears very quickly and you are forced to clean it with a rough 3m pad to get the stains off. It has hairline cracks all over the place now and needs replacement. I will not buy this product again. It's gonna be a project to replace this. I wish it was made from a more durable plastic but it's the hard brittle kind. side does not drain soap dish part just holds water and gets nasty. Would be a great sink if it was more durable
1,No information.,"Not in manufacturer's box, no parts list, no installation instructions, no information available at Crane Plumbing or American Shower. I think I probably got someone else's return, so guess where this is going..."
3,Not bad for the price,"At a little over a buck each, these are inexpensive. But they are very small. The opening has to be less than the size of a dime for the flange. But they were inexpensive! Now, where can I find some small bottles with small openings? Looks like a trip to the craft store is in my future."
3,Served Purpose,Subj wicks were only inexpensive solution to finding wick top large enough to work w/our high end oil lamps. Manufacturer's custom wick cost was $10-$16 each...We're very satisfied.
5,THIS BOOK HAS HELPED ME MORE THAN ANY OTHER!,"Arthur VanGundy is an amazing author! Before reading this book, I thought I had read just about every book on success. What I didn't realize was all success begins with an idea. VanGundy explains how to generate those ideas with methods that are practical yet powerful! His wit also makes the book a quick, entertaining read while you are learning the techniques. I would rank this book with the best business books of all time!! This book literally changed my life. I would recommend this book to anyone, in any profession!"
2,Better as a movie,"Unless you're really into money matters and banking, I found this book somewhat boring and violent in some spots. It has an interesting story line as far as some of the characters go, but the author delves pretty deeply into the banking business. It suprised me because I really enjoyed Mr. Hailey's other books which prompted me to read this one. To his credit, he does seem to really investigate the operations of his targets, Airport and Hotel for instance."
1,Looks bad. The bags are stuck together.,"Do not buy this. Cheap rubber color, which make the bags to stick together and and if you try to peel the bags the color will come out. Very bad packaging. They should have given individual paper in between each bag."
2,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!!!!,YOU WILL NOT GET THE ORIGINAL JUICY LUCY FROM 1969!!!!!!!THE TRACK LISTING IS MISLEADING!!!!!!!MY FIRST AND LAST EXPERIENCE WITH AMAZON!!!!!!!!
3,Gone And Mostly Forgotten,"Where Blues-Rock meets Hard Rock, there stands Juicy Lucy. The band is not an exceptional or excellent exponent of either genre, but here they are fairly consistent. This may well be their finest moment. Recommended to fans of Mountain or older Clapton."
5,Fantastic! The best cookbook I own and I own many!!!,"If you have sophisticated taste in food, love to cook, but don't have much time this is the book to add to your collection. Most recipes have only 5 or so ingredients and are simple to make, but they taste like you've been cooking for days! If you are in Providence, R.I. don't miss Al Forno, the restaurant that the authors own"
1,Dead on arrival,"This watch was just like the other Activa watch, it was dead. You would think they would ship them with a good battery. If you read the reviews on Activa you will find many people are receiving them with dead batteries and sometimes after replacing the batteries they still do not work. I just returned mine to Amazon for the 2nd time. I should not have to replace a battery to see if the watch works."
1,Buyer Beware!!!!,"I purchased this watch for my daughter for Christmas, and it arrived dead. I took it to watch repair, and had them replace the battery. The watch ticked away for about 10 minutes, and died again. I returned the watch to amazon, and they did there part as always. I received a new watch from them in a timely fashion, and guess what?? The new watch was dead on arrival as well!! My advice to you is this... If you see these wonderful looking kids watches, and are looking to purchase one, don't!!! I can see one watch not working, but 2?? Come on!! Well, needless to say, I purchased a watch from another brand, and it works flawlessly, but I received after Christmas, so I gave it to my daughter then. :( Avoid Activa at all costs...you've been warned!!"
1,ABSOLUTE BLASPHEMY AND NOT GINUWINE ZERO stars,"This is an absolute waste of studio time here folks! The record shop was playing this horrible cover version by Ginuwine and it was terrible to say the least. Generally artists try to improve or add to a remake or cover but this is just flat, dry and overall empty. What possessed him to try and tamper with a classic by Prince. You can't immitate a classic folks! If you can't handle the heat of the classic best leave it alone or stay outta the kitchen! ZERO stars here! Nice photo though!"
1,a Bad Karoke Joke,there are Very Few songs that I have Heard other Artist's cover that have surpassed the Original.well this Ain't It.Ginuwine adds nothing to One of Prince's Classics.instead He makes it into a Bad Night at a Karoke Bar.no feeling or depth whatsoever here to me.
5,Multi-Kut files,"If you haven't used a Multi-Kut or Nucut file yet then you're really missing out. These files cut FAST, as fast as a bastard file and yet leave a smooth finish. This is the first file I reach for when I want to shape and refine steel."
5,Things as more books should be,"This is a beautifully written book about different occurances in a young boy's life that make him loose his innocence. It is filled with some tear jerking metaphors, powerful quotes, and a sad and wonderfully accurate portryal of life. It is a 'Catcher in the Rye'-esque read that leaves you feeling nostalgic sad and happy all at once."
3,Thing as They Are,"I liked the book. Life from a child's view is something adults tend to forget. We tend to believe that childhood is a carefree, unaware and uncomplicated time. It's not. I wish I would have read it when my children were small. I may have been more patient and understanding."
2,Not for a stovetop,"I do not know how every one else's experiences with this pot were so different from my own, but the first time I tried to put the pot on the stove, it began to burn, and make a strange smell. So, after the first use, the bottom of my pot is already scarred. I can assure you, there was nothing on the stove top, it was the pot itself that was burning. I used an electric stove, as opposed to a gas, but I do not see why that should make a difference.The infuser is very nice, as is the look of the pot. However, if you are looking for a pot to put on the stove, this is not it!"
2,gifted but not used,Primula glass tea pot with infuser- I was given this as a mothers day gift. When I went to pour the tea the handle cracked and I could not use it. My daughter tried to get another one sent and Amazon stated that they could only give a refund upon return. I would have liked another as it was a delightful gift.
1,Cancelled order,"I ordered 5 of these to give for Easter presents, it showed they were shipped and then today (3 days before Easter) I received notice my order was cannelled because they were out of the product. Their site still shows they have many available so don't order any!!!"
2,handle leaks on first use,"I got this product as a Christmas gift. The first time I poured hot water in, it started leaking all over the counter. I can't really tell how, but somehow water is leaking out at the point where the base of the handle is attached to the pot. It didn't appear to be cracked (as in another review) but it is clearly not functional. I had already opened the flower and so I just brewed my tea in a bowl instead. The tea was delicious but the pot is useless."
2,A little boring,Not what I expected and wasn't really into it. I found it a little slow and stopped reading halfway in.
4,"not bad, i liked the exercises","This book was useful if you need a broad overview, and I like their layout better than Barrons. But basically they contain mostly the same info at least on the verbal part. If you have lots of time and want to work through everything in this book, you could certainly learn alot of vocab. And they have some good tips as well."
2,Incorrect answers,"This book features answers that are just plain wrong! The GRE tests subtleties of words and phrases and this book ignores them. If you can pick up with book used somewhere, I suppose it is good for basic practice, but don't count on it for your main method of review."
2,"Beware there are 2 models, one doesn't do remote TV","Sony CSS-PC1 Cyber-Shot Station for PCI bought a Sony CyberShot DSC-T100 that is what I use it with.Buyer beware: I thought I was getting the ""HC1"" which has a remote control, hooks into a HDTV for high definition slide shows. The ""PC1"" doesn't and lists for half as much. It's my own fault. The thing works ok. It seems harder than my former Fuji and docking bay to get the camera docked, I worry about breaking the pin. It just doesn't slide in. But whaddya going to do? It's an almost discontinued model. The camera is great, it syncs up great with computer software (Windows XP). If you search on Amazon you can find brand new ""HC1""s for about the same price (discounted from $79.99).CyberShot myself in the foot. One simple letter makes the differenc."
1,DANGEROUS,"I purchased this tent, I was satisfied until it collappsed in the rain, I pout it back up and the next time it rained it did the same thing except the 2nd time the frame bent. It is obviously poor workmanship with inferior design AND very dangerous, there were people under the tent when it collapsewd. I contacted the company and this is part of the response..I quote...""The refund that you discussed is really out of the question in this matter due to the fact that the frame that you are waiting on was granted as a courtesy above and beyond the manufacturer warranty. (i.e. incidents involving ""Mother Nature"" are not normally covered under the manufacturers warranty.) As you have previously stated, the damage to your original frame was caused by a ""rain squall"".They obviously don't care about their customers or the products they sell..stay away from this thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BTW..I purchased it in April for summer use...it is now October and still no replacement - BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE"
5,Hilarious,"I read it to my own kids when they were small, read it until they and I had it memorized. I then took it to school where I read it to my eighth--yes, eighth-graders who laughed and got sing-songy and guessed the next line and who chanted along as soon as they figured out the pattern. We next wrote our own versions and read them to the elementary kids. Good stuff for all ages. One of my favorite books!"
5,My daughter and I became Shel addict because of this book,"My daughter received this book for her 4th birthday. That made us total Shel Silverstein addict. I bought every book by Silverstein for the following few years. Now my daughter is driving a car, but I still continue reading and buying his books for my nephews and nieces"
5,a giraffe and a half,i neice LOVES this book! a classic for me and now i can pass it on to her...aaahhhh!
4,Fun little poem for children,"""If you have a giraffeand he stretched another halfYou would have a giraffe and a half.If he put on hat and inside lived a ratyou would have a giraffe and a halfwith a rat in his hat.""And so it goes on. Shel Silverstein's poem, A Giraffe and a Half, shows the Giraffe getting into sillier and sillier situations. It's illustrated in black and white and it's quite comical to read and look at the pictures together.I was reading this aloud to a young child and we have fun together, looking at the pictures and seeing the different situations the Giraffe found himself in.Definitely a fun read for parents and young ones."
4,My 9 year old said it was good,"She has the whole collection and loved ""The light in the Attic and Where the Side Walk Ends"" the best."
1,dumb or dumber?,"Too much Shel is NOT a good thing! I felt my IQ level drop as I read this book, I wasn’t amused by his style and I’m sorry I didn’t read up on him more before I purchased several of his books. BE SURE you do your research because how he expresses himself is simply a matter of opinion, you just might not like it!"
5,Giraffe and a Half,Wonderful witty book great for readers of all ages. Sure to tickle the fancy of children at all stages of life!
2,Hire a professional!,"I'm in the middle of raking up all the thatch that was created using one of these blades. I am on day two of raking up this mess and looks like it will be possibly day three. Tried the lawn mower with bag, but it filled so fast it was too time consuiming emtying it al the time.Furthermore, the blade didn't reach deep enough into the thatch. So, after I rake up this mess, I get to do it all over again!.The spikes create alot of fluff - but I would say a good third of it is the grass it ripped up - basically the lawn got a very short hair cut and maybe half the thatch came up.Do yourself a favor - hire someone to do it!"
3,AHHH - The joys of Power Raking my lawn!,"In the past, I have hand raked my lawn, with regular lawn rakes and with a specially designed ""de-thatching rake,"" with a lot of hard work for the desired results. And then what to do with all of that thatch stuff? Then I hired someone to do it for me, with mixed results for the money. Then I had my lawn service power rake my lawn (good job, for a lot of $$$$$). Finally I decided to try one of these Power Rake blades for my lawn mower. After reading one of the previous reviews, I combined this blade with the mulching blade on my mower, mounted at 90 degrees apart. The result was a fairly well thatched lawn with the thatch and clippings chopped up so fine that it was hardly noticeable, all with little more effort than just mowing the lawn. All in all, I would recommend the use of this product for a less than professional but still acceptable result for the money and effort."
5,Adapting it to my electric mower,"I have a cord mower, 19"", and it took a bit to adapt the dethatching blade. I ended up putting the dethatching blade below the cutting blade. At first, I tried the dethatching blade alone, but on my mower it did not work, it attached over the plastic fan part and quite quickly melted it because of friction. Then I tried it beneath the regular blade and it worked. Added benefit: the regular blade blew the clippings into the clipping bag, so I didn't have a big raking job to do. Caution: I had to experiment a bit with the height settings and do several passes to avoid overstressing the mower motor. Once I got that down, it worked fine!"
4,Works great,My lawn probably never had been de-thatched and I was to lazy to rake de-thatch the whole thing. This blade worked well for what it is. I didn't go to low on the mower so it wouldn't destroy my lawn and it still pulled up most of the dead grass that I had. I did have to go over with a rake to get some of the tough to get stuff but if you are somewhat lazy like me and hate raking this is definately the way to go.
4,You can make this work,"Only problem with this is that it doesn't really fit as universally as they make it seem. Got a Ryobi 48v electric mower and it took a little imagination to make this work. In the end, it did its job, although it was time consuming. Another annoying thing was that the blade wouldn't allow the debris to make it in the bag, so everything had to be raked and gathered as best as possible leaving much grass and weed debris over the areas we were trying to get clear of so new better grass seed would take."
1,Parts don't fit,"1st problem was attaching the springs - one wasn't coiled to the proper length, so you couldn't get it seated over the bolt enough to get the washer and nut on it. One spring fit perfectly, tried swapping sides, but one was just a dud - got it to fit by putting the bolt in and clamping the blade to the work bench, then used a hammer and punch to get the spring seated. Good thing I had the hammer and punch because the second issue was getting the center adapter seated - again, a poor fit. Maybe I got a dud, but I had a power rake on a previous mower, and didn't have these issues. Can guarantee I'll be breaking out my old steel toed work boots when I fire this thing up!"
3,This is a prety good album for a first,"Someone gave me Neyo as a gift. I was pretty impressed, there are only about two or three songs that I skip on the CD. Althought they played the heck out of ""So Sick"" on the radio, I still like it. I love ""Let Me Get This Right"", ""Mirror"", ""When You're Mad"" and ""Let Go"".....overall the CD is good"
4,His Own Words Work Well,"Something about Ne-yo's first single shouted this album is going to be hot. Hearing about other songs he's written for other artists made me crazy waiting for this release. When I first listened In My Own Words I was not disappointed because I thought every song was on point in every aspect especially the production. The limited guest appearances is what I love most about this and especially since it's his first, I can't stand when a new artist has a bunch of tracks with a bunch of other artists on it. His lyrics are different and he sings about things guys are always thinking but never sing about like the single When You're Mad. I think the only flaw in Ne-Yo's debut is that radio stations are playing his music way too much because it's really starting to make me hate this album. All in all this is a killer debut and with Ne-Yo's multitalented mind he's going be able to stick around for a long time."
3,It's okay,"Not bad for a debute album, I was only aspecting better from him. I'm impressed by the lyrics I really can relate myself to some of the lyrics, Vocally he is on fire he not seems to have any problems with hitting those high notes. But I not always get the feeling that he has put his heart and soul into this album. From the 12 songs i only like 4 of them those are So sick, It just ain't right, Sexy love, and Let go and that is not much for a 12 track album i advice him to come the next time with something better then this."
4,Refreshing Rare Talenth,"Not everyday do u find such a talented songwriter. He is rare. I will say his voice is not as advanced as his songwriting but he does stay on key unlike some of the new guys (Chris Brown)I think its a strong debut but he will need a great 2nd single to stick around. But in the end he will be ok because not only is writing songs for more than half of the r&b; community, he wrote all the songs on this disc too. Give him his credit. He's talented and this CD is worth the money. My fav song is ""Time"" and ""Mirror"". Refreshing.He's got the makings of a long career"
5,So Sick,"I think ne-yo's cd was hot...he really showed creative and vocal skills, i really enjoyed Jus Aint Right, Mirror, and Let Me Get This Right, just to name a few. But I was upset because it only had 13 songs..should have been more..."
4,Solid Debut,"I rushed out to Best Buy to pick up the new CD I've been waiting for. It's a solid debut.There are only two songs I don't like. One of them is ""Mirror"", which is just too much sexual information for my tastes. I love ""So Sick""(of course), ""Stay"", and ""Sexy Love""(if every man talked like that it would be ALL good!)"
4,TIGHT,"TO THE B**** T. Robinson ""historynp2003"" (Louisiana) U NEED TO QUIT HATIN CUZ U FAT AND UGLY AND U CAN'T SING. U PROBABLY LIVE WITH YO 12 CATS CUZ U CAN'T FIND A MAN U SHOULD BE ""SO SICK"" OF EATIN!!!! THAT'S THE REMIX B**** !!!!"
2,a low-budget Sisqo,"vocally Ne yo reminds me of a low-budget take on sisqo.the material here is hit&alot of miss. He will probably have a chance behind the scenes in the long run,but vocally he can't sing as well as Mario.Ne Yo has a understanding for radio&that will suit him better in the long run,but this album just doesn't have alot of good songs."
5,NE-YO IS GREAT!!!!!!!!,"I had to get Ne-Yo's album the first day that it came out, which was February 28, 2006. I was hooked the first time that I saw his video to his first single ""Stay"". He is adorable and is such a great singer. I don't have a favorite song off of his album, because I love them all. His voice is just so seductive and addictive. Please lose any doubt that you may have about buying his album, just do it. You won't be disappointed. I love you NE-YO!!!"
3,IN MY OWN WORDS,"Think Ne-Yo is bummed that his songwriting success of 2K5 (Mario's ""Let Me Love You"") got snubbed at the Grammys? Probably not. In fact, the Arkansas wordsmith is patiently waiting for next year's awards ceremony. Ne-Yo's ""So Sick"" was a runaway hit last quarter, and it pushed him center stage for his aptly titled debut, In My Own Words. The lead single captures the delicious irony of writing a love song about being tired of love songs; it also marks the end of the creativity flowing from Ne-Yo's quill. He purrs ""Baby I love making love in front of the mirror"" in ""Mirror"" and then chants ""Sexy love . . . keep me sprung"" on ""Sexy Love."" Despite his billing as a songwriter, Ne-Yo's voice is the true main attraction, and on In My Own Words it quietly slides in with the likes of Omarion, B5, and Bobby Valentino. Perhaps we should consider a new genre for the bevy of highly libidinal soulmen with sugar on their lips. Ne-Yo Soul? Nah, too easy."
5,Awesome New Artist.,"Ne-Yo's album has got to be one of the best.I love his songs. They have great beats and incredible lyrics.His voice is fantastic.My favorite song off the cd is ""Sexy Love"".Buy this cd today, you will not be disappointed."
5,very talented singer and songwriter,"he's a breath of fresh air in this era of r&b when all the music was beginning to sound the same and lacked soul. If kanye west rescued hip hop last year, ne yo is rescuing r&b this year. He's written songs for mario, mary j blige, rihanna and now it's his turn to shine. I love his smooth voice it's so sexy and reminds me of early 80's michael jackson. He truly has a gift for writing great melodies and sophisticated words and shows it all off on this record. I just get chills at the beginning of each song when there is a piano and a percussion instrument like I have not gotten from any other artist in so many years. Ne Yo is going to be around for a long, long time. He is nothing like the omarions and chris browns and all those other sissies at all. Ne Yo's the real deal, fasten your seatbelts everyone!"
1,POOR!!!,"You can only leave a good review for Neyo or you get your review removed from the list. But I have over 500 cd's, so my expectations are high and after so sick, Mario's let me love you, I was expecting a great cd but sorry, this is not, he can write good songs like the above, but the cd as a whole, is only worth 1 star.I just had to write a review because I was so disappointed in the almum as whole and I did not want another person to fall into the same trap I did, due to the hype around this guy. So if you have been into r&b; like me from the early 90t's, and you have alot of cd's and you have reached a stage were, if you are going to spend your money on a cd, all or at least 8/10 tacks must be good, then take your time before you decide to buy this cd. When he comes up with a great cd with more than two or three songs I will be one of the first, to get online and say so."
4,Alright,"Ne-Yo is a hot R&B; artist that has talent. When his first hit So Sick came out, I had to have the cd. At first I was a bit disappointed from the cd cuz I expected more but overtime it grew on me. So sick is the best song on the album in my opinon but my favorite songs from the album would have to be -Favorites In Order1. So Sick2. Sexy Love3. MirrorI also love his song You Ain't Gotta Go By Ne-Yo but it ain't on this album.4. Time"
4,Wonderful!,"Ne-Yo's first album is wonderful! Every song is good! He's a solid songwriter. Very soulful voice he's got. Refreshing music. Stay and Let Me Get This Right could be the next future singles after So Sick. He's written some good songs for other artists, but he has his own style. He put his album out at the right time when there's not a lot of competition and people are still playing last year's albums without getting into 2006. It's kind of early, but he's bound to get the kind of recognition next year like John Legend is enjoying right now. Creatively done, musically sharp, modern without being too trendy, and vocally honest."
4,Great Debut Album!,"I must say... This is well worth the wait. So, since it is on sale this week - go out and get it. I would have liked a few more ballad-ballads. And I would have liked a slightly more mature subject matter. But I had to remember - d*mn, he is only 22! All-in-all a great album"
5,love this album,"i just love this cd ne-yo is coming out strong wit this one i love all the songs on the album but my personal favorites are ""Get down like that"" ""Let go"" ""When youre mad"" and ""it just aint right"" this album is great"
5,NEYO NEVER DISAPPOINTS,I love this album always had. Received the album BEFORE expected delivery date.
5,The Ne-Yo captured my feelings in his songs.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this CD because it just captured some of the emotions that I am going through at the moment. Although I am twice the age of the artist, the expressive emotional vibe that is given with each of the songs brings it all into perspective."
1,what the funk is jay z thinking,"def jam used to be a rap label now I see sorry singers taking over neyo sucks this is for those who like stupid annoying kids like chris brown, and omarion."
3,Ruark's cash cow grows old,"This is essentially an anthology of columns written for a major outdoor magazine in the fifties. These were among the last columns written by Ruark for it and essentially the boy has grown and the major character the 'old man' is gone. So, you get a lot of rehashes of the same material written previously as remembered by the boy. I guess you should keep in mind that these magazine pieces were written to be read monthly and not a series of short stories. So, if you haven't read any ""Old man the Boy"" material it will be an interesting and gratifying read. If you have read the delightful series ""The Old Man and the Boy"" it is diminished. And if you're choosing between the two books, read the first one. Everything is better the first time."
4,The Boy matures just a bit,"I actually enjoyed this book, a follow-up to the author's previous collection of short stories, ""The Old Man and the Boy"", more than the original. This one is more far reaching and diverse as to local and subject matter than the first. Like the first book, this too is a collection of short stories but one finds the settings ranging anywhere from small town Carolina to African savannah to Indian jungles. A well rounded outdoorsman's library should contain both titles."
2,Some Things Are Better Frozen,"and Evan Tanner's one of them. Why, why, did he come back? And why, why did I try reading him again? Well, because Lawrence Block is so good I can never really believe he writes these. And this one is especially bad. Plot: Thawed agent sent to Burma by aging ""control"" to assasinate popular leader. Meets suspicious British fellow who tries to lure him to tea. No, Tanner has a mission. Finds the street where popular leader lives and (surprise!)soldiers are there telling him he can't visit. Oh well, let's leave that then and get to the guest house to discover alcoholic love interest. Find mysterious dead man in bed (who was he, anyway?) and suspiciously heavy pack. Ah ha! Arrested and thrown in jail. Guard leaves door open and he escapes, to meet love interest and walk across Burma.Get the picture? A real loser."
1,Lawrence Block wrote THIS?,"It's difficult to believe that Lawrence Block could possibly have written this. Block creates one vivid character after another in his Scudder series (Walk Among The Tombstones and A Long Line of Dead Men are especially recommended). But he stumbles badly here.Tanner On Ice has it all: A rambling, utterly structureless plotline; paper-thin characters; creaky dialogue. You get the idea that Block is parodying the spy genre somewhat, but this doesn't even work as parody.What's aggravating is, Block is clearly expert enough to write a spy thriller that mocks the genre even as it uses the same conceits to capture the reader. He just didn't succeed here. What's more, I could not possibly bring myself to try the other Tanner books when they are published; if they're anything like this, I wouldn't get past page 3.Bring back Scudder."
1,A potboiler,"I wanted to cry""shame."" The Scudder and Rhodenbarr series have spoiled me but with the expecations they raise this contrivance with its easy political jokes and hoary gag-lines that have been on ice longer than Tanner is just not worthy of the author."
4,ice thaws after awhile ...,"i was surprised to say the least, when i was reading and read the part where Block leds you to see how Tanner's been out-of-touch with the world. Block has a very unique way of writing that has often been imitated, but never equaled let alone surpassed.I have to say I'm a huge fan of Block and like almost all of his work (havent read it all yet lol). While I was very impressed with The Thief Who Couldn't Sleep - one of Block's best i think, i feel that this sequel of sorts is lacking a little as far as atmosphere goes, but then again its not the same story, its very different.Even Tanner is a fairly deep character (not quite as much as Block's other protagonists such as Keller or Rodenbarr). Also there's that sense of humor that Block can always pull off with a dry wit - makes me chuckle to myself everytime.While the general plotline is sorta ridiculous, Block pulls it off - and it takes a great writer to make a bad storyline sound good."
3,Blows Hot and Cold,"OK, take Austin Powers (1997) plus Beyond Rangoon (1995) and you get Tanner on Ice (1998). You got your man o' mystery thawed out after a quarter century, you got your escape from Burma (or ManMadeMylar, or whatever it is now (it'll always be Burma to me)). Throw in a little bit of Man from Uncle, with Mr. Waverly gone a little soft in the head maybe, plus a few other loose ends, and you've got a book.You get the feeling the main purpose of Tanner on Ice is to set you up for still more Tanners. A lot of the stock Block concerns here, such as booze and breaking and entering, plus a bit of Burma. (No books, but at least a few bullets.)Despite the extremely thin material here, Block keeps you reading, mainly through the proven pulp technique of a major plot twist every three pages. Not the best Block, but if can't good whiskey, the ayet piu may do....."
1,"Whatever the 5-star reviewers are smoking, I want some","This was given to me as a Christmas present. To be charitable, I guess it's the thought that counts.An earlier reviewer had the word exactly: drivel, is what this is. If you take away all the pointless dialogue and the self-indulgent musings, you're left with a trite plot and a bunch of self-parodying characters. There's plenty of really good Florida fiction out there without having to waste time on marginal, not-ready-for-prime-time writers.Mr. Allison would be well advised to keep the day job."
2,"Author shows promise, however, work is a little pretentious.","Now that Dan Allison has his first novel out of his system, it will be interesting to see what he comes up with next. I actually enjoyed many parts of this first work and am hoping Mr. Allison's next book won't be quite so pretentious. I would actually like to see more of Jake Murdock and his adventures. Albeit, a little more planning in the area of overall plot would be in order. A good idea...just needs refining!"
3,"Good read,.......","As a fan of ""Florida Noir"" or ""Florida Mystery"" or whatver they call it now, I stumbled uopon this author. I read both his books ""All the Little Birdies"" and ""On the Whispering Wind"".I think these are essentially self published titles, but they were very good. I can see the Hiaasen and maybe Dorsey influence, but it isn't blatant. However, if you like them, you should like these.....I enjoyed the books and would purchase other titles from this author in the future."
4,Up All Night,"Glenn Frey's solo career has been hit and miss, but on The Allnighter he fires on all cylinders. The album is propelled by the big hit ""Smuggler's Blues"" which is a great tale of drug dealers down in Florida. It's inventive video got major airplay on MTV and was the basis for a guest-starring role for Mr. Frey on Miami Vice. The album is more than just a one-hit affair. The title track is an ode to partying, ""Sexy Girl"" is a mid-tempo number that has a ""New Kid In Town"" flavor and ""Better In The USA"" is in the vein of a Chuck Berry number. Overall, this album shows Mr. Frey's ability to write a good hook and make listener-friendly music."
3,His Worst Album,"All of Glenn's solo albums (and all Eagles albums too for that matter) are very uneven (eaach of his solo albums includes 4 great songs) and this is the worst of the bunch. It does have some great songs (Lover's Moon, Let's Go Home and New Love) and some decent songs (The Allnighter, Sexy Girl, I Got Love and Better In The USA - maybe) but the rest is REALLY BAD!!!! Somebody Else, Smuggler's Blues and Living In Darkness are unlistenable and embarrassing. Get it if you must, but better to start Solo Collection or Stange Weather, No Fun Aloud or Soul Searchin' which are all much better than this."
4,"Thank You, Chuck!",No one has impacted me more in the early years of my ministry like Chuck Swindoll. I read everything he wrote. He writes like a pastor who cares for his readers. His readers are like his congregants.This volume is no different. It reflects the heart of a pastor and the mind of a teacher. Buy it! It will help you through some tough stuff.
4,Letters via Chinook,"This book is ostensibly a collection of letters written by the author and his sister to the author's grandchildren. I am sure that is an accurate representation. The purpose was to record for the youngsters the life that the great grandparents and their offspring lived on a homestead in southeastern Montana. I was raised in the same county as the Ambuels; my sister was born the same year (1918) as Philip Ambuel. The descriptions of life on a homestead of that time and place are accurate in every detail and will not be found in many other sources. The format makes the telling very personal and enjoyable. It also makes the readability somewhat varied, but not objectionable. This book is important as a historical record as well as a good way to enjoy an afternoon"
4,Thumbs Up!,I read this book in one day. It was historical as well as humorous! I really found myself getting drawn into that place and time. A must read!
5,Helpful and Entertaining,"I purchased this subscription for my girlfriend (now Fiancée) for the past couple of years. She loves the magazine. A little too much in fact, and now that she has a wedding to plan it comes in handy. The magazine has tons of examples and ideas for ones own wedding plus tips, advice, and even a month by month calendar to help out. Really a great buy if getting married.As for Magazines through Amazon, I have no complaints. I even had to change the address a couple times and it was a one minute process and very easy to do."
3,"Some Pros, Some Cons","Have owned it for 2+ years.Pros:- Excellent Sound quality- Long Battery Life- Durable, thing can be tossed around and screen has never scratched even with no case to protect it.- CheapCons:- The buttons slowly stopped doing what they were supposed to. Occassionally hitting ""next"" will do the dreaded random all. Or it might pause. Could be because of all the dropping over the years but I don't think so. Seemed more of a gradual onset of dysfunction than any ""breaking.""- Random all is useless and annoying.- The software is buggy. It crashes a lot, and the built in player rarely works.- The touchpad is hard to use, even after years of practice.Conclusion... Buy it because it's cheap and plays great music for long periods of time. Plus it doesn't need iTunes or the proprietary song format.If you have more money to spend, however, there is almost certainly something better on the market that is also non-iPod."
1,The worst customer servive!,"I bought the Creative Zen Touch 20 GB MP3 Player for my daughter as a Christmas present. It worked fine until the screen developed a big black spot right in the middle of it. It looks like it's burned. I called technical support (405-742-6622) and had to wait for about 20 minutes before someone finally answered. This clown told me I had to pay them $10 for tech support. I told him I just wanted an RMA# so I could return it, I didn't need to go through any nonsense. He told me my 1 year warranty wasn't going to cover replacing a defective screen and that I had to return it with $25 and that the repair department would probably charge me $100 to replace it. These guys suck! This is a $200 MP3 player that's going to cost $100 to fix a defective part."
2,Decent product - awful customer service,"The player worked great for about a year and a half, then I decided to update the firmware from Creative's website so that the player was compatible with WMP. The player froze up during the update and is now stuck in recovery mode. I am an intermediate computer user and have tried all of the self-help on Creative's support site to no avail. Creative will not even provide email tech support now that the warranty is period is expired. They want $25 to issue an RMA for repair ... the least expensive repair is more than the price of a new identical player. I will never buy another Creative product."
2,"Good player, but cheap","The interface is nice, sound is good, and it stores a lot of music. However, after having this player for about 6 months the volume stopped being adjustable (the cheap volume buttons on the side somehow broke internally and now it's useless). Since the warranty on this thing is no-where close to apple's, there was nothing I could do to fix it. So, after wasting a few hundred bucks I bought an ipod and am now happy. Since the volume and controls are all on one wheel, I don't have to worry about 5 different buttons breaking. Plus the warranty for the ipod starts at 1 year (compared to Creative's 3 month warranty), so I won't have to worry about it breaking in 6 months again. Sorry Creative."
1,"If you have an existing large mp3 collection, DO NOT BUY!","Wonderous Creative Inc fails to notify buyers of the Creative Zen Touch 40GB that all files in your music library get copied to ONE single ROOT directory on the player (Read: No Subdirectory functionality whatsoever). The only way to sort your new glorious one directory jukebox is by id3 tags. For those of us who have been using mp3s since the internet was born, we made a habit of deleting id3 tags because they were RARELY uniform accross the CDDB. Sometimes they seemed like they were written by people who could only type with a rubber mallet in one hand and a basketball in the other. Or they would classify Bach under grunge.Lessons learned: Id3 tags are as only as good as their authors, and any kind of naming/classifying standards for music have yet to be developed.Oh yea, and the touch pad pretty much eliminates any kind of in car usage."
1,Waste of Money,"I bought a zen touch for my sons birthday. he hasnt used it very much, but the buttons on the front have stopped working. it is just within the warranty.There is NO 1-800 customer support line. They charge you for technical support $15 for 30 minutes. We have been trying to get an RMA number to return the player for about a month now. Everything is by email and we have heard nothing from them. It is extremely frustrating not being able to talk to anyone at creative about this.I was dismayed to read about the problems everyone else is having with this product."
2,Partially Satisfied Customer,"The first day I got my Zen MP3 player, the hard drive immediately stopped working by the second song. I returned it for a different player and am satisfied with the second player so far. My only problem with the Zen player is that you cannot create files to store different types of music or certain albums, but I guess you can overcome that issue by playing music according to artist, genre, etc... Also, I'm still waiting for my refund from e-parts and more for having to ship out my broken player. It hasn't come yet."
4,Keep all your music with you!,"I bought one of these after making extensive comparisons with other players. I didn't want video so I chose this older model. The sound quality is very good with some separately purchased earphones (the ones in the box are okay but not great). The battery life is amazing. I'm not sure if it gets 24 hours but I use it every day all week and I often don't charge it before going back to work again on Monday. I only have two complaints, this player is heavy, but that is to be expected with such a long-lived battery, and that when I am accessing a large playlist the player can take a very long time to respond. Also I find the random button on the front a bit silly, I listen to a lot of different styles of music and hearing opera followed by pop music just doesn't work for me. That said, this is a great player and when the time comes to get a new one I will buy another product from Creative."
2,Too many breakdowns,"I enjoyed my Creative Zen Touch when it was working. The first Creative Zen mp3 player I received had a problem with the stereo in a few months when I put in the earphones. You could get it to work if you held the earphone connection in a certain position.I sent it back under the warranty and I received a ""new"" refurbished one -- serial number crossed out and covered with white label. It too went down in a couople of months and I sent it back.I again received a ""new"" refurbished one -- serial number crossed out and covered with a white label. The earphones are no longer working on this one with the same problem as my first one.So three Creative Zen Touches and each one had problems. I guess I'm going to buy an iPod."
3,no folders,"Great mp3 player with one fatal flaw. All mp3s are stored in one directory, making it very hard to organize songs and resulting in a lot of file name conflicts.An mp3 player just needs to be a portable hard drive with headphones. Amazing how many lack this basic functionality.So it's not perfect, but it is better than an ipod. At least it doesn't meddle with my primary music library the way the ipod does."
2,"Better design, but locks up all the time.....","Had a Zen xtra 40gb player that was great except for the toggle switch. The Zen Touch fixed this with the touch scroller, but it is a little hard to get a handle on. Sound was great using 3rd party earbud headphones or when connected to another stereo. Industrial design/build/feel of the unit is greatly improved over previous versions.Skip using the included software and just use Media Player 10 for free - works much better for organizing music and keeps all the same details on the player as well - cataloging, file extensions, etc.The BIG problem with mine and my neighbor's 20gb Zen Touch is that it constantly locks up while playing. You can hear the disk spinning/grinding. Neither unit has been dropped and we have run scan disks and are running the latest firmware.I am returning my today! iRiver will be next on my list....."
2,Works but uncomfortable,"My wife didn't like this, not very soft material and very rigid back which makes it difficult to sit down while wearing it."
4,Helped with my back,"For some reason, I thought this would be a nude color (as it looked in the photo), but it's actually white. Wish it came in a more neutral color. In any case, it did help with my back pains as my belly grew bigger. I had to loosen the belt when I sat down since I didn't need the support and it was a bit tight. But when I walked around, I would tighten it. It's true to size.The downside is that the care instructions say to hand wash instead of machine wash. It also was a bit irritating if I wore it on my skin, so I would wear it over my pants, which allowed me to loosen it easily. Other than some minor complaints, I say this was worth the purchase."
1,Not really working,"I used it a few days, can not use it often since it makes my belly itchy and reddish. I guess I'm allergic to the fabric they used. When I wear it I don't feel any support either. It's also noticible from outside of your clothes that there is something on your belly."
5,The whole album is tight.,"I need not say no more,Tennessee is comin' up major in the rap game.I got much love 4 the underground gangstas,because these east coast magazines don't show no love.Trust me buy this cd.This is M-locc a TRU fan of $outhern Gangsta Rap,KAZE STAY UP."
3,...,"The cd is another classic to add to your collection if you like Hypnotize Minds like I do. MC Mack has pretty good skills and sounds nice on some Juicy J and Dj Paul beats. Project Pat is always good, this is when he first started to find his new style of rappin'. I'm no fan of Scanman, I don't think he can rap at all. All in all it's a pretty good cd, look out for songs like: ""Pure Anna"" , ""All About My Hustle featuring T-Rock"", and The Kaze's version of ""Lock Down""."
1,Absolute junk,"I spent a great deal of time installing cameras for one of these DVRs (for home security) only to find out that the DVR did not work. Silly me, I called tech support only to find that Swann is an Australian company so their tech support is never open when anyone except for American vampires or long-haul truckers might be awake. By using the Swann website, I've found that the HD is defective and Swann will not replace it unless I pay to return the unit to them. This company does not stand behind it's products. Do not buy this DVR. You should absolutely not rely on a piece of junk like this for any sense of security for life, property, or business."
1,Swann = Lame Duck,This product only worked for about 6 months then just stopped recording. I think the hard drive is bad. I would not recommend this product.
5,Sundowner,I have been an Chris Claremont fan of his since I discovered his first book. This has been an interesting series to follow.
1,Great..While they lasted,"I've had them for four months and the sound quality was terrific. Then the right side went dead. I always realized how small (and expensive) they were so I made a special effort to take care of them, but one month after the warranty expires they quit. Yes, if you register on-line, the warranty extends for one year, but it's still a nuisance when they quit."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased these ear phones to upgrade my ipod headset based on a number of very positive reviews in a number of different publications. When I got them however, I found them to be very tinny. Way too much focus on the highs with little or no Mid or Base (and I typically love sharp highs). I am sending them back for a pair of much less expensive Sony MDR-EX51LP (much richer sound with good highs despite heavy base emphasis)"
4,The new earphone's cool,"I just bought this pair from Amazon, and it's so far the best pair of earphones I have ever had. It sounds better, and the clip helps stable the earphones so no more slippery off my ears when I am running. I like this product."
2,"Lack of bass, too much treble.","I just received my pair today, and I have to say, I'm extremely dissapointed. Yes, they are comfortable, but the bass is almost absent, no matter how far you jam them into your ears, the bass isn't nearly what it were hyped to be, it definently isn't enough for the amount of mid & hi's they produce. Unless you like your bass to a minimum and treble to a max, I'd recommend another pair of earphones. If you're just looking for comfort and you don't like hardly any bass, these are your headphones. But, as others said, you can find much better earphones for a much lower price."
3,"Good sound, but suffers from that ""stethoscope"" problem","You know that problem where you get that rumbling, scratchy sound from the wires of your headphones rubbing against your shirt or bouncing around while you're jogging? These suffer from this problem. The sound quality is great, though I am no audiophile. I just like hearing the bass in music so I prefer these in-ear style headphones. But more often than not they end up with this annoying problem. I still use them for casual listening on the couch and in bed, but I'll need to find something else to use for jogging."
3,I have these and they are ok,I bought a set of these and used them out in the yard for mowing and yard work with my ipod. They fit very nicely without hurting my ears and have excellent sound cancellation. The only thing they do not have is good bass response. The audio quality is absolutely awesome. I just wish they had a bit more bass. I bought a set of V-Moda bass freq headphones and for the money they are worth the money! I bought sets for my Mom and Sister and they love em!
5,Etymotic Earphones,"These are great earphones. I have both the ER4 and ER6I, both sound great but I prefer the ER6i because the ER4 has a stiffer wire that tends to be microphonic. In a side-by-side comparison they sound very similar to me. But I'm not an audiophile.I use my ER6 earphones nearly every day in the gym where I do weight lifing, spinning and jogging. They fit securely in the ear and isolate all the gym noise including the crappy musick they play. I've had the ER6i's for about 6 months now, they seem pretty sturdy, I even pull on the wire which Etymotic says not to do :-).I've tried many earphones over the years, include the Bose noise cancelling headphones and the Sony noise cancelling earbuds, but nothing compairs to the ER6i for size, cost and sound. Very nice!Have a great day!"
2,Sound great until they bust,"I purchased these 14 months ago. During that time I was realtively satisfied. I think the sound is good, almost great. The flanged eartips fit great in my ear, especially if I trimmed down the large ones with an xacto knife. I like to go to sleep to music and these fit nicely in my ear, even with my head turned to the side.It all ends there. After 14 months, the left ear was sporadic and I had to jiggle the wire to get some sound. I sent them into etymotic and they said for $76 plus $6 shipping they would send me a new pair. I don't think so.I took care of these. Yes I did wrap them around my iPod and put them in my back pack from time to time. Everyone does this.For a product that is not durable, these are NOT worth the money. For substantially less, the Senheiser or Sony models sound better and are more durable. Don't waste your money !!!!!"
5,Well over a year of imaginative play!,"We purchased these for our boys for Halloween 2009. My boys were 2 and 4 at the time. Now at 4 and 6, they still love to play with them. We're coming back to purchase two new sets because the first ones finally broke beyond repair. Considering how much rough play they received in the past 18 months, I'm highly pleased with the durability of this product! Great toy for little boys who want to be knights in shining armor!"
4,"My boys love this, got my money's worth out of it already!","I have a 3 and 5 year old, boys. They love this product. The helmet is small and does not fit well though and part of the sword handle broke but they still use it. And they abuse their toys, as most boys do, and it is still in good shape after 5 months. I got my money's worth out of this one!"
5,Very Helpful,"I am a new to this aspect of history, and I was amazed at the amount of detail covered in the book. Considering when it was originally written is impresseive as well"
1,I'm waiting for it,I can't review the book because I haven't received it yet. It's still in transit from the 20th December 2011 in CHICAGO IL US. When I'll receive it I will write how it is and if it respond to the description of the seller.
4,A Good Book!,"The Allyn & Bacon Guide to Writing Portfolio's was an effective book to use for the construction of a portfolio. It had all the necessary content to piece together a distinguished portfolio. It had examples of good and bad pieces from Portfolio's. The problem is not with the book, rather, with the subject: unless they're creative or visual art, portfolio's are boring. It said everything that it needed to say, though, and it said it concisely, which is nice. A lot of portfolio books tend to get full of themselves and ramble on about nothing. This one didn't do that. The chapters were easy to access, and the book was well organized. I had no problem finding anything I needed. I also liked the fact that it gave examples. Every time I was stuck, I would flip to one of the corresponding examples in the book and figure it out with no problem. I would recommend getting the Portfolio Guide to anyone who planned to do many of them."
3,Guide for Portfolios,"The Allyn & Bacon Guide to Writing Portfolios was a helpful book for those who are trying to prepare a portfolio. I think that it was well organized and had good sources. There were many things that were helpful in this book. I thought that the questions that began each chapter were helpful because they started the chapter out and helped me know exactly what was in the chapter. I found the reflection statement chapter most helpful since I didn't know how to do that aspect of the portfolio. The appendixes at the end of the book were also helpful. Being a visual learner, it was easier for me to see a good example and a bad example, instead of rambling on about how to do it. Overall, it was a well-prepared book and I think that it would be helpful for anyone who is preparing a portfolio."
4,Pro blues stylings,"This is a more traditional blues sound from the band that made my favorite album of all time. (Get A Whiff a' This.)The vocals are about as good as you can allow for white boys on a blues jag. There are some truly stellar moments , and maybe even some new ground plowed here. If you enjoyed Zappa's version of ""Willie The Pimp"", you'll like this one even more."
3,Get it for the filmography,"The book opens with a biography of Krzysztof Kieslowski, follows this with several critical essays, and finishes with a commented filmography, which makes up the bulk of the text. The comments on the films are extensive and instructive; unless you have seen at least ""The Decalogue"" and ""La double vie de Véronique"", you'd certainly do best to read the filmography before reading the essays, but even if you have seen those, you'd probably still do best to have read the filmography first. Sadly, the essays, while interesting, aren't absolutely stunning, and after reading through the filmography, they seem in parts a bit redundant--unsurprisingly, the same concerns that occupy the author in the essays occupy him in the filmography, as well--and entirely too short. However, if what you're looking for is information about a film of Kieslowski's, this book will serve you very well."
5,Beaver Behind,"This is just hilarious. I got it for my uncle and he gets double takes from his fellow golfers! LOL You can't help but laugh. Also, the quality seems to be there."
2,Guess looks and sounds better on film.,"I was very dissapointed with the CD, after listening to it for over 10 times I still can't remember one tune by heart. I still plan to see the film though and enjoy the actors and actresses in this film. I hope my film experience will be much better than my audio one. I really liked Ms Jennifer Hudson at the Academy Awards and I'm a big fan of Edie Murphy."
2,Ok,"Apart from Beyonce singing Dreamgirls, this album doesn't bring much. It's a dud. Most of the songs are just a lot of talking not actual singing. The movie was good, and I think it's better to watch that and listen to the songs. Unlike the soundtrack ""Casino"", which I can listen to and enjoy without seeing the movie, I can't with this. they should have done what most movies do and pick a bunch of great oldies by other artists back in the day to create the movie/soundtrack. and i'm also very sick of Jennifer Hudson. sure she can hit high notes, but she only sounds like she's screaming. her voice is not appealing. i rather listen to Beyonce's voice any day; it's easier on my ears. i also don't like how she's so arrogant and ungrateful to Idol. i don't think she's going far with that kind of stink attitude. it just shows you're a sore loser."
3,She ain't no Ms. Holliday...,"If you've heard--or better yet seen--Jennifer Holliday belt out ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going,"" you'll understand my disappointment in Hudson's thin, overwrought version. She lacks the depth, passion, and emotional ""catch"" of the Broadway rendition. Not that she's bad, not at all, but like the other actors, her voice is ""nice,"" not much more. Foxx and Knowles are, at best, fine--only Murphy brings passion to his role. The movie is splendid, but as a ""listen,"" stick with the original."
4,"Look out Beyonce, it's Jennifer Hudson's time to shine!!","Jennifer has such a strong voice and it is compelling. She sangs instead of sings!!! I enjoyed the cd, but enjoyed Jennifer and Jamie the most. I hear that not only does Jennifer out sings Beyonce, but out acts her also. I also hear that the movie is based on Effie's life, the character played by Jennifer, so can anyone tell me why Beyonce is nominated for the Lead Role and Jennifer nominated for Supporting Role for the Golden Globe awards? What a crime. I can't wait to see the movie. I hope Jennifer wins in any category she is placed in, she is a winner in my book. Go Jennifer, get your shine on girl."
3,Enjoyed this soundtrack,"I enjoyed this soundtrack - it reminded me of the movie which I loved.Jennifer Hudson's version of Im Not Going was amazing - other favorite songs are Patience, Listen & I Love you I Do.This is the type of CD you can put on and just let it play.In my opinion If you liked Dreamgirls then you will like the soundtrack."
5,DreamGirls a Reality of Talent,"The vocals on this CD (and the movie itself) are INCREDIBLE! The talent of Jennifer Hudson literally gave me chills as she sang ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going "" and ""I Am Changing"". The depth and emotion coming through Jennifer's performance is unparalled. Beyonce's performance of ""Listen""is remarkable. If you like old soul & R&B you will love these CDs. The music makes you move literally and emotionally. A Must have!"
5,Finally!!!,Beautiful renditions of a greathow the vocals excellent and the movie should definitely be a wonder to behold.
4,Different Versions than single CD soundtrack?,"First of all let me say great movie! Seen it twice at show! Everyone claps after Jennifer Hudsons performace of And I Am Telling You Im Not Going. Anyway i dont own either copy of this officially, but have downloaded songs from it. I do notice that some of the songs are sung differently on this single version and the deluxe. Example on the Deluxe 2 cd set the song Hard To Say Goodbye My Love is the version from the movie where Beyonce is singing lead. The version on this single soundtrack its not Beyonce singing lead, its someone else. So some of the songs are different. Since i dont own either cd im not sure what other"
4,worthy of the name,"if this is any indicator o the movieas a whole, i cannot wait to see it. Hudson is great, as is Foxx, Knowles is strong, and it seems to stay faithful to the original, with the obligatory extra song so they can get an oscar nom. for it. surprisingly good."
2,Not living up to the hype.,"I will probably get shot for saying this. But Jennifer Hudson is NO Jennifer Holiday. She my have a strong voice, but it's not Holiday strong (not to mention as skilled) If you want to hear these songs at their best, get the Broadway soundtrack."
2,Dreamgirls,"I really enjoy some of the songs on this CD. I do have to say that it is kind of a let down to listen to the CD after seeing the movie in the theatre. Seeing the emotion on the singers face really adds to the dynamic of the songs when you're watching the movie. I cried during almost every song when I saw Dreamgirls at the theatre, but not as much listening to it on CD. It is an excellent movie with a great soundtrack. It is very inspiring and a lot of hard work went into it obviously, I'll give 'em that. Kudos to Jennifer Hudson! She really belts 'em out."
5,Dreamgirls: Music From The Motion Picture [2-CD Deluxe Edition],It was great to buy just after I saw the movie.
4,Could of done better,"With a soundtrack that was based on the music of Motown, there are few memorable songs on it.I longed for some Smoky Robinson or Dozier inspired tunes, but they were not to be found. A musical based on Motown should of brought me to tears. The one stirring song sung by Jennifer Hudson was ""bravo"" stuff, but the rest of the tunes were either contrived or just plain dull.Joan"
5,A KNOCKOUT,"HUDOSN IS THE BEST SINGER I HAVE HEARD IN A LONG TIME AND SHE ALSO IS A TRULY GREAT ACTRESS. BEYONCE SHINES BUT GIVES THE CENTRAL SPOTLIGHT TO THE NEW GIRL IN TOWN WITHOUT GIVEN UP AN INCH OF HER INMENSE TALENT. THE NEW ARRANGEMENTS ARE BRILLIANT AND THE NEW SONGS ARE FANTASTIC ESPECIALLY ""LISTEN"" . BRAVO TO ALL!!!!!!!"
3,Great Movie,"This movie was good, but Jennifer Holiday is still the original diva. Many reviewers may be too young to recognize Jennifer Holiday, but she MADE the song. Jennifer Hudson is imitating her- not the other way around. Jennifer Hudson did an excellent job in her imitation;nevertheless, it was still an imitation. The second half started to slow the movie down a bit, but it still remained interesting.Foxx, Jackson and Murphy all did an excellent job, but Beyonce just did ok."
3,Childhood special,I bought the Little Colonel to remind me of the series I remember checking out of the public library as a child. It was a fun series and I an glad to have a reminder of this special time.
4,keeps you reading,"Close Encounters has a Danielle Steel feel to it, and it's clearly aimed at a female audience, though I have to admit I liked it. Author Sandra Kitt had a good police advisor (I am a retired police officer) as all of the police action and procedure is accurate.Kitt is a black woman. She says that she enjoys putting white and black people together in intimate relationships in all her books to see what happens. That is what made this book much more than an average police yarn.Good, easy read."
3,COLOR SHOULDN'T MATTER,I LIKED READING THIS BOOK. MOSTLY B/C I THINK SANDRA KITT IS A TALENTED WRITER. I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS B/C I'VE READ ANOTHER BOOK BY THIS AUTHOR AND IT JUST SEEMS THAT THE LOVE BETWEEN HER CHARACTERS IN THAT BOOK WHERE BOTH PEOPLE WERE BLACK WAS MUCH MORE INTENSE. I'VE DATED OUTSIDE MY RACE BEFORE SO I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS BUT LOVE IS LOVE AND RACE SHOULDN'T MATTER!
2,What is Life Worth?,"After watching Mr. Feinberg being interviewed on television I was most anxious to read his book. It goes without saying that the topic is both fascinating and poignant. However, given that the author is extremely distinguished I was perplexed as to why he felt the need to continually bombard the reader with his credentials. I felt quite bogged down with his repeated self-aggrandizing and was rather turned off. He came across as very caring and obviously intelligent during the television interview so I can only conclude he communicates better orally than in written word."
5,Excellent book,"This book is great, its concepts are in both mathmatical and intuitive forms. The graphical approach makes it easy to understand yet you still get the equations for actual implementations. The second half of the book is all about examples/applications that are applicable towards all disciplines. Excellent choice for understanding of the FFT!"
3,Singer embroidery foot,"I'm not sure how well I like this foot. It's the one for my Singer sewing machine but, so far, it's not working well. I'll continue to use it and become more familiar with it so I'm withholding judgement until then."
3,Other than the fact that it's cheaper...,"... I can't imagine why anybody would pick this one disc collection overThe Mickey Rooney & Judy Garland Collection (Babes in Arms / Babes on Broadway / Girl Crazy / Strike Up the Band). That is a five disc collection with the exact same movies - one disc per film - plus there is a bonus disc with over three hours of extras that include:Private Screenings with Mickey Rooney - 1996 TCM special hosted by Robert OsborneThe Judy Garland Songbook- A superb collection of 21 complete, magical Judy Garland musical numbers spanning her many films from 1936-1954Mickey and Judy Trailer GalleryIt has been around since 2007, so usually you can find a new set on sale cheap. For durability of packaging, value, and the extra features I can't recommend the old set highly enough. I've really enjoyed my copy over the years."
2,Overdone,"Our family was disappointed in these films. There are several interesting performances by Mickey (playing drums and piano) but overall, his Andy Hardy and horse movies are much better and more entertaining. The musical dance production numbers directed by Busby Berkeley in these movies are very strangely overdone. ""Love Finds Andy Hardy"" is a great Rooney-Garland classic and a much better choice, in my opinion."
3,TCM Greatest Classic Legends: Rooney & Garland,I enjoyed the movies very much. But the sound on the DVD's was very poor. I had to sit right next to the television in order to hear what they were saying. In all the DVD's I have bought from amazon this one is the worst for sound I have had.
4,It's A Circuit Breaker,"What does a woman say about a circuit breaker? It works! It solved my problem! How about something like, this little beauty has a shapely figure, smooth skin, not fat at all and the switches really turn it on! Great product. Thank you seller!"
2,Disappointed,"Although I enjoyed reading ""The Stormy Petrel"" (5 stars), ""Thornyhold"" (4 stars) and ""Touch...Cat"", I was not too impressed with ""The Ivy Tree"" or ""Madam, will you talk"".They were still a better read than the Artus series though.Right now I'm rereading ""Madam, will you talk?"" after many many years again, but even on page 100 I'm wondering why this novel gets so many great reviews here on amazon.com. It's not bad, but it's not that good either.Two stars for the descriptions of Avignon, Nimes, Les Baux, Chateau d'If and all these beautiful places in Southern France, I've been to all of them more than twice, even to Marseille's Canebière and Vieux Port. However, I wish the plot wouldn't be as formulaic. Stewart always describes some young British woman who is trying to overcome her last unhappy relationship (or she is a widow in mourning) and going on a long trip to either Greece or France where she inevitably gets involved in some dangerous adventure while meeting Mr. Right."
3,Good for a season,"After I heard ""The Falling Kind"" I picked up this album. After I listened to the entire album I was struck by just how similar Veda sounds to an early 90's band out of Ireland. Listen to ""Chimera's"" album, ""Earth Loop"" and I think you will hear the same thing. Vocally, they sound similar. Veda's ""Lover's Lie"" sounds VERY similar to song on Earth Loop, but I can't find the CD to really compare. I liked Chimera, and I like Veda, but the songs on this album are not going to be on constant rotation on my ipod playlists.This isn't to say this album is bad or uninspired. It's good but it gets kind of grating. You can picture the band being co-opted into adding a song to the latest comic book adaptation soundtrack. More along the lines of ""Daredevil"" than ""Spiderman."""
3,"Not bad, not bad...","I also saw these guys (with a female vocalist...she was hot, too) open for dredg the other night. They actually reminded me somewhat of dredg. I'll tell ya, though, they don't have much variety in their music (from what they played). Everything sort of ran together after a while. I really liked them for the first couple songs, but after that I'd heard it all. And for the curious, dredg was absolutely awesome, even if Gavin's vocal chords were hammered, which forced him to take the lower register on certain parts (he apologized to the crowd for this). Anyway, if you like Veda and you've never heard dredg, I'd seriously consider checking them out first."
5,"Thank You Rhea, this is GREAT!","KNOWING THE PAIN THAT EVERY GAY/LESBIAN YOUNG ADULT GOES THROUGH IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD KNOWS THE HATE THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE FACE AND HOW THE FAMILY COPES WITH THESE CHANGES AND THE TRUE MEANING OF LOVE AND FAMILY AS ONE. I LOVE BOTH OF MY CHILDREN...I'M PROUD OF THEM AND I WOULD NOT WANT IT ANYOTHER WAY. IT IS SO HARD FOR ANY YOUNG PERSON TO FACE THE FACT TO HIM/HERSELF ABOUT THEIR SEXUALITY BUT TO THEN HAVE TO TELL THE FAMILY THAT THEY LOVE SO DEAR IS SO VERY HARD TO DO THIS BOOK IS A MUST FOR EVERYONE STRAIGHT OR GAY/LESBIAN MAYBE SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T WISH TO UNDERSTAND JUST MAY SEE THE LIGHT.THANK YOU AGAIN RHEA YOUR FRIEND, LINDA"
3,I loved it,will let you know when I show it - it should be good. I watched it and thought it was good to have as a reference tool
2,Fly & Lure Retriever,Awkward and not really functional...Awkward and not really functional....Awkward and not really functional....Awkward and not really functional...Awkward and not really functional.
5,so beautiful,"a film so raw, so perfect, so beautiful, with a message and nature so pure. a film of this kind can only be made once."
3,Fun but cheap,"My daughthers love this drum, but it's very cheaply made - flimsy plastic and cardboard on the inside. One of them decided to step on it the other and broke through one of the sides. As long as your kids don't try something crazy like that, you should be fine."
1,"Cherry bookshelf is red, not cherry.","This bookshelf is described as ""cherry finish"", but it's actually reddish brown - more red than anything else. It does not even come close to matching my cherry furniture. Now I have to pay for return shipping plus take a 20% restocking fee. It will probably cost me more to return it than it did to buy it! Plus it was packaged in very cheap material that FORTUNATELY I did not tear up as I was opening it. But you have to send it back in the original packing material, and it was a total pain in the butt trying to get that thing back in the box with all the packing material that was crumbling as I tried to fit it into the box. I am extremely dissatisfied, and it will be the last time I order any type of furniture from Amazon.This is the link to the product.5-tier Wooden Corner Bookshelf In Cherry FinishedIt is sold by several merchants. I got mine from Visiondecor, but I'm sure they are all the same."
5,"Good quality, long lasting knives","My husband and I purchased these when we were first married in 2004. We still use them almost daily. I have not had to purchase any replacements or throw any away. The 2 sets of four are still in great shape and are good, sharp steak knives. I wash them regularly in the dishwasher and have had no issues with them rusting or pitting. Definitely recommend!"
2,Blade too thin,Knives are just ok... The blades are too thin and bend too easily while cutting. I'd have gone a different rout if I had known this.
2,Mail Call!,"Nice idea and lots of ""extras"" to play with besides the mail, but the mail doors fall off very easily and make it a dangerous toy. My son has pulled them off and then fallen over. He now knows they come off and it's the first thing he does."
2,Muy largo,"Se que el actor se tomo 13 anos, pero es muy larga ademas las descripciones narrativas son tan extensas que muchas veces adelantaba en las paginas, a la par de leerlo vi la pelicula algo cruel tambien; de todas maneras agradezco el aporte literario."
5,Hume Rocks...,"...but then everyone knows that. He's witty. He's lucid. He's profound. He's humane. Admittedly, Hume's Treatise is pretty dense (I've never been able to get more than 100 pages into it), but his two Enquires are masterpieces of philosophical literature. Anthony Flew's edition of the Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding has helpful notes and interesting biographical materials (such as Adam Smith's touching memorial of Hume). Great stuff."
5,This Cause produces the desired Effect,I read this work basically focusing upon Hume's famous theory of Cause & Effect. (To be read with 'An Treatise of Human Nature.)Despite the traditional philosophical ambiguities that accompany a critical interpretation of his work; it remains a 'must-read' for anyone serious about the grass roots validity of theory and experiment in Science.
5,"If you dig really rockin' rockabilly, this is it!!!","What a fabulous collection of brand new selfpenned rockabilly this is. Hot & cooking, rough and rocking, while staying true to the original 50s sound. What a ball!! - Reviewed by The BlackCat, 2006"
3,Mediocre Content,"My 1-year subscription with Dwell is almost up, and I will not be renewing. I was hoping for insightful, practical and applicable articles for modern living, but instead, I found a product catalog instead with the occasional interesting article. If you're looking for inspiration pictures, you can definitely find them in this magazine ...or on Pinterest.All that said, I do appreciate what the Dwell team puts together, and will consider purchasing past Special Issues (e.g.: ""100 best houses"" / ""Bath & Spa"" etc). Unfortunately, for me, the monthly magazine just doesn't have enough substance to warrant a subscription."
3,"Great Concept, but . . .","I like the concept of Dwell Magazine as I am very interested in prefab/modular homes. And it is the only magazine of this kind (to my knowledge) out on the book stands. In the northeast, it was more difficult to find but thanks to Amazon.com I was able to get a subscription to this relatively new magazine. However, their pictorial shots and presentation didn't excite me in wanting to find out more about their product(s). Their editorial was at times more technical than it needed to be for the average person. Their editorial team could have done a better job in presenting more useful information pertinent to regional building requirements (pros/cons), etc. in the U.S. In fact, their advertisers were a times more exciting to peruse. I did not renew as I think they need to better understand the needs of their market."
1,nothing 2 look at,It's been a month since i've order Dwell and my first magazine have not arrive so i don't have much to review.
3,Not What I expected.,I received this magazine a few days ago and was surprised that it came so soon. I thought I would be getting the next issue not the one I received. The magazine was not what I expected but that was not a bad thing. I did read a couple of articles I found to be quite interesting. Its good not to be predictable.
1,i have not received the magazine!,i ordered the magazine a month ago and have not received the first issue yet so i can't review it!
5,Green,I appreciate the quality of this magazine. Dwell was introduced to me by another architecture student. It is informative for many of us are concerned with green building.
1,cancelled my subscription,"after about two months of recieving this magazine I returned it. It just wasnt what I was hoping for. I normally subscribe to veranda, and coastal living and thought that the magazine was along those lines but was bored with everything in the magazine"
2,"Great eye candy, no useful content","This magazine has great photos, and as an aficionado of mid-century modern I am drawn to it like a moth to a flame. But, if you want to actually apply any of these ideas to your own house, don't hold your breath--unless you have $150K to plunk down. The featured houses are all either custom built new homes, or incredibly expensive redesigns. I actually got pretty excited the first few issues, with all the possibilities, until I mentioned some of the materials to my architect friends. Yes, the Nanowall is great, but it is $30K for a SLIDING DOOR.I have begun to find the magazine frustrating to read, simply because they dangle these amazing homes in front of me with no real hope of my ever approximating any of them in real life.I was hoping for a magazine that is far more practical."
3,Missing Issues,"Love the magazine but rarely get them. My husband got my a subscription last Christmas and I have received about two thirds of the issues. The customer service usually responses quickly and about a month after I complain, I get the issues about a month later."
5,DWELL MAGAZINE,"I have not received any issue yet for the new subscription to Dwell, but I know from my previous subscriptions, it is a fine magazine for architects and those who are interested in buildings in general."
3,Far from their best...,"I think I now have every Cusco CD available in the US. This is my least favorite. It seems almost like this CD was done by a different group completely. The tunes just don't grab me the way almost every other Cusco CD did. They seem much more flat and lifeless, like a bad hair day. Unless you feel the need to own every last Cusco CD, I'd probably stay away from this one."
2,SNL doesn't utilize Jon's comedic talent,"My fault for buying anything connected to SNL. I quit watching it many years ago. After Belushi, Aykroyd, Radner, et al the show wasn't worth watching. It definitely wasn't written to showcase the comedic talent of Jon Lovitz. Jon is one of the funniest people around when he does his thing. This is a waste of money."
2,Another Bomb for the SNL Bests,"I wish I had rented it before I spent $ on this SNL Best also.3 out of 3 SNL Best for Christmas and they all stunk. Jon Lovitz is funny too. Who ever put these together did an injustice to the Comedians. Don't waste your money. Rent it first and see for yourself. Truly, another dissappointment!"
4,Good Stuff,"Value for money, extremely easy install ... great looks, love it .. anyone can install without any problem ..gave a new look to my entrance :-)"
3,Average,"It was a good read, well-written. However, it really didn't introduce anything new to the subject area than what has been rehashed over the past 20 or 30 years."
5,JESUS IS ALL I NEED! More Biblical Proof....,"This book was awesome! God has covered everything through T.D. Jakes in this book for the broken-hearted. He reminds us how precious we are in His sight. We are created for a special purpose & this book spells it out beautifully! Dispelling all the lies of the enemy, nourishing our souls with God's very own Word."
5,Inspired by God,"I find it amazing how God uses a man to deliver a message of healing for women. This book is truly inspired by God as it speaks directly to the heart of women. I read this book at a time when I needed healing from a relationship and found it very helpful. I am going to read it a second time, this time I have other things I need to be loosed from and I believe in Jesus' name that the book will have a total different meaning this time around and will in fact help me to overcome this as well. I love the fact that the book is full of scripture."
3,Good Message - Decent acting - needed better script,"Good Message - Decent acting - needed better script. The premise and the plot were well developed, yet the weakness in the screenplay made it weak in places."
2,JD Jakes Woman,"Purchase of book is disappointing due to size of book. It is more like a pocket size than a sit down book. While I expected a soft cover, I didn't expects the smallest of it. Will not buy a book again unless it is clearly sized on advertisement. Or maybe I will look more thoroughly."
1,never got the book or a refund or nothing,"I never got the book I sent an email, telling me it was sent out and the postal service had it well my mail lady didnt have it, I WILL NEVER order from a different company unless its straight from amazon and not a different store posted I would rather pay the more expensive price than not get what I ordered"
4,Loose,"TDJakes is a fan favorite, but let me introduce you to this best selling novel that was highly recommended to our book club and ultimately became our bi-annual book of the year. It's called ""WAITING TO EXIT HELL."" This novel is a real-to-life book. We were blessed to be able to get this powerful sistah to speak at our luncheon and she is really real. She showed me how serious it is to seek the kingdom of God first and then he will truly add the rest. This book really affected me personally and I know that it will reach you too in one way or another. It took a tremendous amount of courage from this exciting novelist. I'm looking forward to her next book."
5,An Absolute Must for Every Woman!,"No woman should miss out on the wonderful messages the Holy Spirit has for their healing and encouragement. Bishop Jakes certainly ministers to hurting woman through the power of the Holy Spirit in this book. Most women that read it feel that God is speaking directly to them--and He is! The Love and Mercy of God are evident in each and every word delivered by Bishop Jakes in this vital spiritual work. The wounds are exposed, ""oil"" is applied by the minsitry of God's love, and healing ultimately takes place. God is a good God and through this book, I truly realized how special women are to Him. Although society does not always see women in a positive light, this book will be a refreshing and liberating message to women all over the world, confirming to us that we are precious to God and He cares about how we feel. Don't miss this book, it will set you free!"
3,"Good, but not as potent as others","Overall, it's pretty good. However, this particular ebook does not use the voice of TD Jakes as the narrator, so you lose the potency in his usually ""on fire"" messages because of that."
4,book study - sold out locally,"I could not locate any copies where they said to shop, went online and found a new book at less than what the store wanted to order me a copy. Had it in less than a week."
5,You will be blessed if you apply this book to your life!,"This book is for those in search of answers in their life. It explains about being a woman, even in this chaotic time. If you've had trouble in your past and present, ""Woman, Thou Art Loosed"" is a Godsend. It helps all types of women, young and old, rich and poor, Christian and Gentile. This book is a blessing within itself and should be read, applied to all situations, and shared with other women."
5,Life Changing!,"This book has impacted greatly on my life. i did not personally purchase it, but i am thankful that someone did. God spoke to me through this book, allowing me to let go. My bonds, the chains that were once holding me back from what GoD has for me have been broken. it showed me how to resist the devil, not accepting what it is that i should reject. It did not matter to me whether the author of this book was a male or female, i believe that despite the gender the book would have been exactly what God wanted it to be. i would definately recommend this to anyone, not just those who have been abused or have low self esteem, but to anyone who just needs a touch from God, becuse if you begin reading this book with expectations, those expectations will certainly be met. We serve a faithful God."
2,Disappointing,"This book was very upsetting to me...first because it addressed several serious issues and in my opinion, left them open-ended at the end of the book. So if as a child or teenager you went through any one of those situations..it didn't do anything but dredge up old tramautic memories without any way to let go of that pain AGAIN. Secondly, I'm not a very spiritual person and I'm not sure if thats the reason I didn't get the message from it that I was hoping to...but I think it would have been a lot easier to do so if he wouldn't have touched on those painful and touchy subjects and then brushed them off so lightly. I think T.D. Jakes needs to stick to ministering in the church and leave that subject material to the professionals."
2,"Woman, Thou Art Loosed!","This book is not for someone who is in the process of overcoming a situation. If you have resolved yourself to the idea that you will not overcome an issue, then TD Jakes may be able to motivate you. This book appears to be a man's opinion of what a woman should do to overcome problems that only women face. The advice would have been better received and written if it had come from a woman who had actually experienced the life situations that were discussed. I would not recommend this book."
5,Awesome Single,this is a awesome single it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. if you have not listened to this single then i recommend you do
4,Beautiful Music,"Frusciante definetly has a wonderful gift. I was made a fan of the chili peppers from 199's Californication, and I bought some of their older cds. Frusciante is definetlly the heart and soul of a great band, so when I heard he was coming out with a new solo album I thought, ""What the Hell, I'll Give It a try."" I was amazed by the lovely(but somewhat depressing)melodies he uses that really deserve a listen. Some of the songs sound ok the first time, but listen again. Something new is revealed with every listen. ""Going Inside""is a great song that I felt I could listen to over and over and never be disappointed.""The First Seoson"" and ""Wind up Space"" are also great songs yet still not as good as ""Going Inside"". The no vocal songs like ""Ramparts"" and ""Murderers"" are both great songs with awesome beats, and I truly Think He is one of The best Artists out there. ~poostain~ *buy through Amazon because its hard to find locally*"
5,Unique but still as raw as Niandra,"Pop songs the way they should be, there's something delightfull about this album."
4,John Frusciante!!!,"This is a great album, by a wonderful musician! Its an electronic sound, not his best album, but still awesome!"
3,Frustrating,"This album clearly demonstrates that John Frusciante is a great songwriter. Despite the extremely lo-fi recording quality and his sub-par voice, it's consistently intriguing. The problem is, this ain't the kind of music that is enhanced by a lo-fi sound. I can't listen to it without imagining how amazing these songs might sound if they were properly produced. And ""properly produced"" doesn't have to mean ""jazzed up for the commercial market,"" I'm just talking about an actual recording studio, and perhaps a real drummer instead of repetitive techno loops.Ultimately, this is a worthwile buy. The songs themselves are fantastic. Just be prepared to be plagued by thoughts of how much better it could've been."
2,Great music--hire a singer,"The music here is very good; haunting, moody, ethereal. At times the lo-fi recording even adds to the ambience. When John starts singing, he loses me. When he sings in his normal voice, I can get used to it. It detracts from the music anyway, but I can handle it. But then on too many songs he reaches for a falsetto he can 't pull off and makes the songs unlistenable. If this were an instrumental CD I'd give it 4 stars for the style and his amazing ability to play the guitar. But the songs have words and John sings them and he shouldn't. I have listened to this CD over and over, but his voice never gets any better and in the end it lessens the songs for me."
2,A murky album,"The best parts of the album, as noted in other reviews, are the guitar playing and composition, which are quite enjoyable.None of the processing here does anything to improve on Mr. Frusciante's three note range (the growl, the not-so-growl, and the falsetto), and it would have been better to just record the voice straight and clear: with a little more focus, Frusciante could use his unique and world-weary vocal timbre to good effect (one does not have to be a good singer to convey emotion). Without the lyrics enclosed, I would have had very little idea what was being said, due to the distorted vocal. Even with the lyrics written out, they were disconnected, vague and resistant to building an emotional bond with me as the listener. I can see the point of view of the four and five star reviews, and I can feel the talent, but the production, the lack of a solid bass foundation, and the inscrutable poetry undermined the album."
3,"Pretty OK, but could be better.","Well I'm a big time RHCP fan and that's why I also bought this album by Frusciante. John is the greatest guitar player ever, but his singing can be very bad sometimes. One big reason to buy this record was also that Kiedis sayed that it's amazing, but in my oppinion there is only few good songs (going inside and the first season). Gutair playing is though off course excellent on this record and that's the biggest reason to buy this record I think. All I can say is that hopefully Peppers will release new album in the near future."
1,I Wish I Could Return This CD,"A collection of forgettable songs made unbearable by the singing. Don't buy this CD. It's uninspired music sung by someone with an unpleasant voice.Frusciante should emulate Beck and Santana, who usually follow Zappa's good advice: ""Shut up and Play Your Guitar.""I like Frusciante's guitar playing elsewhere and that's what I bought this CD for. The guitar playing here isn't very good either. The average rating of this CD of 4-stars is utterly puzzling to me. A matter of taste indeed, but what is the matter with taste is more to the point."
3,sad!,"I've loved the chili peppers for a LONG time (14 years to be exact)and am amazed that John is still with us. This is the first solo album of John I have heard so far. I cried almost the whole time I was listening, it made me so sad. Chili pepper lovers should listen to some of his work, just to get a feel of his work!"
3,Hold the funk.,"If anyone doesn't know yet, ""John Frusciante"" plays guitar for the ""Red Hot Chili Peppers"". BUT, this sounds nothing like that band. Actually, if you really strain your brain, you can see subtle similarities, but that's it. ""John"" does everything on this album, and it really does sound like a demo of sorts, very lo-fi. I can see him sitting on the living room floor putting this all together. His singing isn't the best, but this isn't ""American Idol"", and I feel it only adds to the music. Overall I like this disc alot. Anyone with an open mind, patience, or a previous fan of his should dig it too. ""Going Inside"" is a great opener, ""Wind Up Space"" is good, and I like ""Fallout"" as well. He has a new disc out this February."
2,pretty but...,"it sure didn't stand up to my henkels( and they're not even the really good ones).. i've used it only a couple times now and tho it's a nice working surface it's already cut to hell.. nice that it's a renewable resource but apparently that means you have to keep buying them.. this will suit the purpose for awhile, and makes a nice serving tray (minus the giant knife gashes) for veggie snack sunday, but i'm going to stop cheaping out on things that look kinda nice and just get myself the butcher block i've been wanting for a long time and that will last for generations.."
4,Great kitchen accessory,"Update: After about a year, even with oiling, I did get some cracks. However, I repaired them with Titebond III and that has solved the problem. I suspect this will last for years now.Not sure about the claims of hardness but this looks good, is well designed, and after a few months appears that it will last a long time. Be sure to apply mineral oil or it could split."
4,PLEASANTLY SURPRISED,"This is the first Perry Mason novel I ever read; I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it. The writing is dated, but overall the book is a solid 4. Its easy reading plus clever, and sophisticated at the end."
2,Production issues,"Tried two shipments of this shower tent. Both had color die migration issues. The red blotched onto the creme color on all sides. If you don't mind what the tent looks like (graffiti), the tent is well made. Quality not what I expect when paying more for the Columbia name. Also found out the this item wasn't made since 2006, with no replacement parts available."
1,I'm feeling a little ripped off...,"I ended up spending just under $20 for this item after shipping - it really isn't worth that much! It must have cost less than $1 to make. Although it will serve its purpose of framing pictures on a magnetic surface, I will NEVER admit to anyone how much I paid for this item.Oh well, live and learn ..."
3,For anyone performing investigations,"works as advertised, but it does miss some things in a written statement that can only be caught by hands on classroom training"
5,we still get compliments after 1 year,this silverwear has a great weight and balance. The steak knives work very well with their serrated edges. We get comments and compliments about this silverware even after a year's use.
2,Not Such a Good Deal,"I bought this set based on the good reviews, as well as the fact that I was able to go to Macy's and actually hold the flatware and see for myself what I was buying. My old set of Oneida had held up very well for the past 24 years and I wanted something new. Well, some of the pieces began to rust within just a few weeks. In addition, food tends to stick to the flatware even after being washed in the dishwasher (I have a new dishwasher)...............I am disappointed and am looking for a new set. I wonder if it's the satin finish that's causing the rusting and food to stick."
2,Chinese silverware,We were disappointed and had to return the set of stainless because the forkswere too heavy and large for normal persons to use. Evidently the discriptionand photos didn't show this. We appreciate your kindness in handling it.
2,Cheaply made - it rusts!,"I bought this set about a year and a half ago based on all the good reviews here. However within a couple months after using the set and dishwashing them, they started to develop rust spots! I have been lazy about sending them back to Oneida for the lifetime warranty but it will be done for sure. Also note that the set is made in China. An older Oneida set of similar quality I have had for well over 10 years has never rusted and was made in the USA. Don't know if Oneida's quality control has improved since I purchased my set but I don't know if I will buy another Oneida set after this."
3,Nice But Not Well Balanced,"I have owned Satin Garnet flatware for several years, and while it looks nice and the overall quality is certainly decent for the price point, I would not recommend it as it is very poorly balanced. Actually, I find it interesting that no one else has mentioned this in their reviews. Yes, it is weighty, but like several other lower priced flatware sets I've looked at, weight is not synonomis with quality. Good flatware should be balanced, and not fall off of dishes easily, which this does. In fact, a guest commented that she also has an Oneida pattern (sold in a set) that is off balance as well. I would have returned this set, but I waited too long. I rarely use it, and plan to replace it one of these days."
5,A real find!,"I wanted an Onieda stainless steel flatware set, but was very hesitant to buy one without actually holding and seeing the pieces. I'd found that even Onieda's quality had slipped over the past few years and any set affordable to me would probably not stand up to family use. After reading the reviews for this set, I took a chance and ordered it at 1/2 price on Amazon. I'm happily surprised that this set is of very good quality. The peices are heavy without being cumbersome and attractive. An added bonus, to me, is that the forks and spoons have a slight dip in the handles that fits the thumb and makes that pieces more comfortable to use. I've just been using this set a short time, so I can't say that it has lasted forever, but so far it seems that it will."
5,Wonderful!,I love this set of flatware. Enough pieces for the entire family and the weight and feel of them are wonderful! They look lovely on the table!
1,Poor workmanship - not recommended,"We started using this set in January 2008. Upon openning the box, at least ten pieces had pitting or defective surface. The box said the flatware was disherwasher safe, but within two washes some pieces started getting marks and rust. Has only gotten worse. Pattern is nice and wooden caddy is handy, but this flatware has underperformed and disappointed compared to my old $40 entry-level Oneida set which lasted for over six years without any marks."
3,Trying something new,"A little disappointed - I'd heard a clip and wanted the CD; it took a long time to come, the case was cracked (the CD was okay) and I wasn't too impressed - too many of the songs sound alike."
2,"Mostly good, but spoiled by...","I bought this album in order to flesh out my already significant awe for Mickey and the succession of material he has produced. It's all the familiar great stuff, but utterly marred by the inclusion of the two tracks from ""Mystery Box"". In short Mickey, they should have remained a mystery. They are Vocal, R&B; cheesy, saccharine and entirely out of place. If you like to listen to Hart for the shamanic beats and interestingly coloured exotic atmospheres, prepare to program your CD player to skip tracks 2 & 3 as they are just awful and guaranteed to ruin any moment. A poor choice from the producers; no doubt why I was able to buy it on ebay for 1.50.I think there is nothing to be gained for the Hart fan here. One would be better off buying the original albums. Buy ""Mystery Box"" only if you feel in need of aural punishment."
4,Beautiful & Classy Gift Basket,"I bought this basket as a client Christmas gift and was very impressed with the quality of products included. The basket is beautifully made of wicker and brass. Although some of the quantities are small, there is more than enough to go around for an office party. The non-edible items like the olive dipping bowls, cheese utensils, and napkins are practical inclusions. Overall, this basket is well worth the money and will make clients - or anyone for that matter - happy, when they receive it. Very classy!"
1,hidden maui leaves maui still hidden,I found this book almost worthless. The book pointed us to who we should pay to take us snorkeling or on hikes rather than let us know where to go. I also thought the book was poorly organized. I definitely would not recommend this book. I received more useful information off a free map of maui obtained from an information booth at the beach.
1,COOL!,When I got susie strawbella she was carefully wrapped in a plastic box.I wanted to name her Sofhee beacause that is my favoite name! I feel really bad beacause I accidentily tore her arm off! Now I'm saving my money for another one.I think I'll just pretend Ssofhee has abroken arm.When I get my next one I'll nameher Amy!Ihope you enjoyed my review!Thanks!
4,fine modern swing compilation,"This CD is a fine compilation of modern swing bands. In fact, this CD really is the one that first got me hooked on the new mix of swing, jump blues, boogie, lounge and such. It ranges from some pretty straight-ahead swing versions of classics (e.g., Cole Porter) to more offbeat bands like Alien Fashion Show (though I have no idea what the Mighty Mighty Bosstones are doing on this album !). A good variety of styles are presented.I think too much is made in other reviews about the ""poor sound quality"" of this CD. The sound is very bright, ""in your face"" and it's true that balance is sometimes lacking a bit. But the point is most folks (I believe) like to hear swing that way ! I liked it."
3,Good Introduction to the New Swing Style,"This CD is a great introduction to the new generation swing style. There are renditions of various songs by almost every single major new swing artist with some notable exceptions (Cherry Popping Daddies are nowhwere to be found). And the CD is definitely in that style of music. My biggest problem is that the renditions on here sound a little different as if they have been modified in some way, it's not horrible but definitely noticeable if you've heard the originals. I honestly don't like many greatest hits albums like this one, I just find it worth my while to get the original discs. For instance the original Brian Setzer Orchestra disc is much better than this one and even has more variety in terms of the song styles. Overall though this disc makes a nice introduction to someone who wants to find out if they even like this type of music."
4,"Bad Sound Quality, Good Songs","I agree with jarrett@sprynet.com. The sound on this CD is not good. However, the songs are fun and I really like working out to this CD--it really get the heart rate going."
3,A sticky bundle,"This is a great value for some very good films indeed (about $6 per film at Amazon's discount). However, as one of the other reviewers noted, this is a bundle, not a proper collection. That means that all 40 films are separately wrapped with Fox's infuriating security stickers that do not come off cleanly. After spending an hour removing the stickers, you can expect to find DVD cases sticking together because of all the adhesive residue. Tacky in both the literal and figurative senses!Otherwise a great deal (especially when you consider that most if not all titles include an audio commentary and other special features.)"
4,Study!!,"This book took a great approach towards the Pedagogy TEXES test. However, I would only recommend this book if you are VERY familiar with Pedagogical studies from your college courses. It's the perfect refresher to ready for the test. It has great vocab terms to remember and great tips on how to analyze test questions."
3,TExES,"Either this book is not up to date, or the course I am taking needs to be more in line with the pedagogy used in the book. The book is easy to use, but I am not so sure it will effectively prepare one for the TExES exam. Unfortunately, it is the authority on preparation for the exam. I'll try to provide more information if I have to take the TExES. (I live in Arizona)"
4,Review Of Floorfilla Debutante Disc,"The songs, Anthem 1-4 are basically sequenced the same, and the words are slightly different, but are repeated similarly to one another. Perhaps that's why the title's only differ with numbers. They are good though. As for the rest, the theme is basically hard-house, and it is delivered through above-average songs(with dumb titles) This is an import, so it's a little more costly than a domestic cd. You won't be disappointed, but i'm sure you'll find a song to skip(Italo Dancer sounds like latin euro-dance from 1995."
3,You make the call,"This c.d. wasn't what I expected. I'm a huge progressive house fan and this just isn't cutting it for me. Track 4 has to be hands down the dumbest track I've ever heard, this c.d also contains some fillers that just annoy me. Don't get me wrong there are some phat tracks on it but not enough for me. Some people might love this c.d. but if your into progressive I'd go with Mixin Marc,Naw T Boy or Brooklyn Bounce Those are all great progressive c.d.s especially Brooklyn Bounce"
5,Excellent recipes!,"This book is excellent! Do I really mean it, given the insightful critiques on this page with low ratings for the book?Yes, I do; and I give it 5 stars to balance out the reviews. Every dish I've made so far has been absolutely delicious--fromthe plainer whole chicken and whole turkey recipes to fancier ones like Chicken Tagine with Green Olives and Preserved Lemon andMeditteranean Fish Stew. I can't wait to try out more recipes, my only regret being that the book is a small compendum rather than a large one with lots of recipes. What you eat, however, will be good!So add this to your collection and enjoy it."
4,Easy Entertaining,I love to cook and I love to try new recipes. The recipes are easy to understand and once the meal is in the oven you can forget it until time to dish-up. Sesame Chicken is sensational! A great book for anyone who doesn't mind spending a little time getting the ingredients together.
3,"Nice Book, Need more recipes!!!","Very nice book (i.e. cover, design, etc.) however it is seriously lacking in the number of recipes that are offered. Especially since it is called the ""Best of Clay Pot Cooking"". I was looking for some great recipes."
4,Great Starter Book for Clay Pot Beginners,"This book gives a terrific base-line for clay pot beginners like myself. I found it easy to understand, easy to follow and the meals come out terrific each time. Of course, we have now started to embellish the recipes with our own ""improvements"", but each recipe in the book is a winner. It is a must have if you own a clay pot to cook in."
5,Friends enjoyed this gift,"Bought this as a Christmas gift, along with a clay-pot roaster, for friends who enjoy cooking. It's a lovely book, and my friends said the recipes were excellent."
2,fair,"A black women and a white women escape a prison run by a lesbian. They are chained together.You think you are in for a chick version ofThe Defiant Ones, except here, half the film goes by before they try to break the chain. They instead hang out and eat mango about five feet from their search party. This is all in one day--its never darkSome nudity and all the bright oranges and yellows you'd expect from an early 1970s exploitation film. See it for fun and then forget it.Soundtrack is great."
5,Whole Lotta Woman!!,"Pam Grier is THE dish in this blaxploitation Classic!! Sleazy, campy lesbian undertones and some truly hilarious dialogue make this watchable again and again"
3,Pam Grier YEAH!!!!,"This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. I rented this filmfor two reasons, Pam Grier and Pam Grier's body. Low budget women's prisonflick with plenty nudity and bloody mayhem. There are better films than thisbut they don't have Pam Grier in them. I was kind of upset with this beingonly a 24 hour rental."
2,not so impressive...,"If you enjoy other blaxpotation movies of this era, you may find this one bearable. The movie is not altogether horrible (considering other movies of it's genre) --- but it is considerably less interesting than Grier's better known film, Foxy Brown. Worth watching if you are only interested in Pam Grier's physique... otherwise, i'd recommend you pass."
4,Great sound for a reasonable price,I'm a full time professional sound engineer and I decided to check out the ER-6 based on the recommendation of a professional drummer that I sometimes tour with. He uses them as his in-ear monitors on stage. I think they cost around $140 when I bought mine. Although I generally find the fit of any in-ears to be at least slightly uncomfortable I really do like the overall sound quality of the ER-6. Plus the isolation from the flanged tips is quite impressive. Great for tuning out all the background noise on planes or other noisy environments.
4,failed design,"I bought these as my first try into ""high end"" earphones.My very first contact was not the best, the in-ear fitting was weird and after a while it became itchy. I stored them for a time and stuck with mySennheiser CX 400 In-Ear Headphone (Black)(which are way cheaper), until one bud died out, after a life span of more than 3 years.Then I took these ER6's out and gave them a second go.I tried the alternative foam ear cushions, but they suck worse than the silicone ones.Eventually I got used to the silicon earpieces, and alas, after only 6 months of use, one side became faulty, sounding very low. I changed the filter but it did not fix the issue.Maybe there is certainly a point to consider that eventually you will pull from the cable to get it out of your ear, and this will damage the piece.For such an expensive product, this performance just sucks.I find that I cannot change the first rating I gave, currently I would give only **"
5,Accurate and cost-effective,"I've been a live mix engineer for over 30 years as well as an avid motorcyclist. For the money, the ER6 are sonically accurate without that artificial bass boost that many manufacturers seem to employ. I use these as my hearing protection for my daily commute as well as long-distance rides. The baffles are quite effective at eliminating wind and road noise, yet I can still hear sirens, car horns, etc. With a little low-volume music piped in via my iPod, it makes for a lovely journey. They are extremely comfortable as I've worn them for 10-12 hours at a stretch with no discomfort. An excellent value!"
1,Terrible sound,"I ordered this headset (the white ones) base on Cnet reviews and the fact that I was looking for a ""Hi-Fi quality"" set. I did try them with 2 MP3, A SANSA 8GB and a Rio carbon (which overall sounds better that the SANSA in my opinion)they sounded terrible, even after doing all the adjustments, I even think I received a damage set since there was a lot vibration from the right side speaker. Totally disappointed with these. They made me gain new appreciation for my BOSE earphones, which sound 100% better than these."
1,Disappointment,"I have $5 earbuds that sound better than these. I was hoping for an exciting new audio experience. sigh.Buy the Shure E series or Bose earbuds instead, I did."
1,No bass,"I bought these based on excellent reviews, but no amount of fiddling is getting any bass from these headphones. I'm very dissapointed."
1,MAJOR DUD,"READ ALL REVIEWS \ LOOKED UP ON CNET \ GOT ALOT OF GOOD REVIEWS \ I DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT EARBUBS , STILL DO NOT KNOW MUCH \ BUT I DO KNOW THAT THESE ARE AWFULL REALLY AWFULL \ SENT THEM BACK AND SPENT MORE MONEY FOR THE SHURE E3C \ NOW THE E3C ARE AMAZING \ AGIAN THESE WERE TRULY AWFUL \"
2,enjoy ... while they last,I can't argue with the sound quality (although you definitely hear contact with the wire -- probably unavoidable with a light-weight wire).More troubling is that they simply don't survive normal use. The wire is too light-weight & didn't last even a year before one ear starting cutting out. I nearly always placed the headphones back in their carrying case after use. They're simply too delicate to be this expensive.
4,Etymotic Research ER6 - Great once inserted,"Full, rich sound. Funky foam cylinders. Easy to clean. Nice carry pouch."
1,Hi-tech Earphones? meh... I guess so...,"For earphones at this price, they were thin, felt cheap, and tangled easily. While I like that in my women, it's no good for earphones. Also, it takes a PhD to figure out how to get these adjusted in your ears properly and I don't have a doctorate in putting complicated earphones on. Sound quality sort of is no longer an issue with all of these problems. I mean really, someone could hook-up a potato with all the hi-tech audio wizardry in the world but it doesn't make me want to pay $100 for them shove them in my ears."
4,Good headphones for a noisy office or gym,"I bought these headphones to filter out some of the noise at my office and the gym. I'd say they do a decent job of reducing the outside noise. I find them especially beneficial at the gym where I used to listen to my MP3 player really loud in order to drown out the radio playing over the loudspeakers. I'm able to clearly hear my music at about half the volume.At first I didn't find them all that comfortable, but I've started to get used to them. They are really small relative to cans so it's easy to take them anywhere.The downside is that I can hear my breathing more while I'm using them, and when I turn my head way to the side the seals tend to open up a bit.Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase."
2,Great sound... ! Durable quality questionable!,"A purchased an ER6i Isolator Earphones to listen to my IPOD (5G). No question about sound isolator quality!!! What is questionable here is it's durability. The problem is inside the jack, specifically the wiring. The cables in there break, apparently very easy. And this is not a common jack that can be replaced since there is where their sound technology resides. The warranty last a year, mine broke a little over a year with no frequent use (priced at $99.)Is it possible Etymotic Research Team matches price, quality, warranty period and durability of this expensive but nice product?"
4,ER6 thoughts,"I bought these headphones to use in noisy situations (like mowing the lawn) to enable me to listen and work. I haven't yet had a chance to try them for this, but they do have great sound. I found the plastic buds to be very difficult to place properly in the ear (placement makes a huge sonic difference), but the foam worked nicely and were more comfortable. In normal situations it shuts out sounds quite well (it's hard to hear people talk), and the sound is excellent in all ways except for being a bit bass shy (the bass is there, but loses some of it's ""oomph""). My other 'phones, Koss PortaPro's, which are open, have a more balanced sound overall (and are better in situations you want to hear what's around)."
1,Disappointing,"These earphones have an extremely long cord. So much so, that I had to wrap it around my neck to keep it from getting in the way. I too, had trouble keeping them in my ears, but what really is annoying is that the filters seem to constantly need changing, and the last time I had to do this, I removed the old filter with the tool provided, and it must have somehow damaged the speaker, because now the sound is terrible and I can no longer use the earphones. Big waste of money."
1,Not good enough....Lousy bass response,"I orderd these hoping to upgrade from my Sony MDR-EX51 earbuds. I was dissapointed! They lack any fullness of bass. The Sonys I already own have significantly better bass and overall sound. I tried endless adjustment in my ears -- pushing them way-in and trying both the foam and silicone eartips -- just could not get a suitable full/robust sound from them. The silicone eartips fit SO snug that they create an air-tight seal. This sounds like a good thing but it really isn't unless you are sitting still. If you are active while listening, an anoying sensation of needing to ""pop"" your ears developes becasue there is no natural breathability usually present as part of your ear-canal anatomy.I would say they are very crisp and clear in the mid-range and high frequency but devoid of bass-punch. If you only listen to classical music these may be for you. If you like rock or want good bass, look for someting else."
4,ER-6 Review,After using the ER-6 Earphones for almost 2 years I have to give them 4 stars. Took off one star because of lack of a strain relief were the wire exits the ear piece. but for sound there tops in my book for the cost. I have custom ear molds made for them. Use them under my Motorcycle helmet hooked up to a Sony Receiver/MP3/Ipod.Sound is awesome.Last Year we flew to Australia and the Er-6s And My Ipod were a life saver on a 16 hour nonstop Air flight.I Can't figure out why the negative reviews.
5,"Great Item, Quick Delivery",No problems with the item or delivery. My earphones are well worth the money.
2,Dissapointed,I was dissapointed enough with this product that i returned it back to amazon. In my mind it did not deliver the goods. I found it to be uncomfortable after any sort of prolonged use (and i did try all the different rubber fittings). The bass was weak and in general i thought the sound quality was average. Definately not what i had expected from a product of this price.
1,Don't waste your money,"I read the reviews and thought these would be a big improvement over my $15 in-ear Koss earphones. Even though many reviewers complained about a lack of bass, my ears aren't usually sensitive enough to notice things like that.Not with these! No bass to speak of, and as a result, they sound very tinny. I tried all the ear pieces, including the foam, which is similar to my old Koss earphones, but none made much of a difference. I even put the foam tips on my Koss and they sounded fine, so it's not a fit issue, it's the ear phones.Save your money, these aren't worth the hype!"
1,Etymotic Research ER6 Isolator Earphones (Black),Sound quality not good had too replace filters fast. Noise canceltion is really good volume of sound not great
1,You'll be sorry,"i was really looking forward to a great experience with these, as i had been using the ipod standard ear buds and these were supposed to be awesome. what a disappointment! there is NO BASS with these things, you have to turn up your volume to maximum to get adequate volume, and there was a distinct hiss. i read the disclaimer about making sure they fit deep into the ear, and i made sure they were moistened and inserted snugly into the ear canal. the fit was OK and they were relatively comfortable (not as much as the ipod earbuds) but they are intended to insert more deeply. no matter how i fiddled with the fit, changed sizes of ear flange, etc. the sounds was thin and harsh. i sent them back the same day. buyer beware."
1,Don't Do It,"I wholeheartedly agree with D.Kraft. These are HORRIBLE. There is absolutely no bass, and I mean NO BASS at all. I thought there was something wrong with my Sandisk so I plugged in the OEMs but they worked fine. Tried the foam inserts and they didn't help a bit. I already had the EQ set up for maximum bass. I never minded the sound quality of the earbuds that came with the unit, was just bothered by the wind noise while cycling, so was looking for something quieter but with better overall response so I could enjoy the music at a lower volume and still be happy. These are not the answer, I can assure you. I don't know what the reviewer at the top spotlight review was using before these but they must have been pretty awful. Or he works for Etymotic. Personally, I think his review is ""hogwash"". But that's just my personal experience. You may take it for what it's worth, I suppose."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE!!!,"I did a lot of research before putting these on my 2005 Christmas list and was very disappointed once I got them and tried them out. I followed the instructions to a T as far as putting them in your ear to form a seal and was pleased that the sound isolation was very good - I couldn't hear anything else in a room full of people talking. However, the output sound quality is very poor: the highs sound quite tinny and the bass doesn't kick at all. I found this to be true for several different styles of music and after monkeying with the EQ on my Dell MP3 player. The sound from my $20 set of Sony headphones is much richer, albeit without the noise isolation. As a final drawback, after a minute or 2, the Etymotics - whether I was using the plastic or foam ear tips - become VERY uncomfortable in your ear. I would strongly advise not buying this Etymotic model and would be very suspicious of the claims they make for their other products."
2,"Disappointed, make sure you can return easily","I did a lot of research and had high expectations for these headphones. Since I couldn't find them at BB or CC (is that a red flag?), I looked online and bought them from Amazon.The sound is flat. The earphones may fit other ears well but definitely not mine. The bass is awful, sounds like blown out woofers on a cheap rental car. And yes, I did follow the instructions very carefully. There is no volume control on the cord, something that even my cheap Sony headphones have.So, I am returning these. I hope you have better luck than me. Not worth $20, much less $80."
1,Waste of money!!,"After my Bose ear buds gave out I wanted to try something that was close to but cheaper than Bose, the ER6 Isolator was not it! you have to push them deep inside your ear that causes suction and you can barley hear the bass the sound quality is terrible. But they do the keep outside noise out and come with an foam ear buds instead of the rubber ones but that does not help. So I went back to Bose got them for $75 dallors at some website I am never going to stray again."
4,maybe this could help with the comfort issue,"i don't own this product but i've demo-ed a few different brands of iems(shures,ultimate ears, westones and ety). i heard these on a CD player with a headphone amp. definitely quite impressive if you're listening to clean music (classical, opera...) and not hip hop or bassy r&b; stuff.anyway, the owner of the shop recommended moisturizing the eartips(flanged sleeves) with body lotion for about a day, before washing them thoroughly. I tried that with my shure triple flange sleeves and they were all soft and nice after. but CAUTION: you have to wash all the lotion off. otherwise, your tips might get stuck in your ears.don't know if it'll work for any of you. but you could always give it a go.also, why not try other brands of eartips. you could modify shure triple flanges into double flanges by snipping off the bottom flange. (that's what i did).Etymotic also has new triple flange tips for smaller ear canals (the blue ER4 ones).hope this helps in some way."
5,"Excellent product, perfect fit for what I was looking for","Very comfortable, They do cut out some of external noise. I thought they were a little pricey, but think they are worth it. Not to sure about the whole filter changing thing as I havent had the need yet but so far so good."
2,They are ok!,They offer good noice cancellation qualities but have poor bass. Takes a while to get use too.
3,Not for the everyday use,"I work in a noisy factory. I purchased these Earphones to replace the usual Ear plugs. I agree that the bass is minimal. Sound quality is pretty good especially if your not a hardcore music listener. Like I said, these Earphones are great for an Earplug replacement, especially if you work in a noisy environment.Here's an update:After 6months of proper care and use,the buttom cord is no good. The cord is too thin to fix. Not worth it."
4,"5, but for Filter replacements","Sound is excellent, beyond reproach, really excellent. Service is excellent, mine failed, Etymotic fixed without complaint. Not so happy with having to replace Filters when earwax fills headphones. Buyers should be aware of this necessity. All around good, though."
2,No Bass,I purchased these after watching DTV on Tivo & the rave reviews. Personally I say they are they are OK the noise reduction is minimal in comparison the noise cancelling headphones from Sharper Image & I worked in a production setting with very loud machines. These also cancel all BASS via my Sony Walkman SRF-M85V; I'm not a Bass Junkie however a little would be nice. For the $$ try them before you buy them. If you like all Treble you'll be fine.
3,Expensive Isolator - No active Noise Cancellation,It does what it does well. There are better values around for MUCH lower cost.Still looking for a good **Active** Noise Cancellation headset.
2,Low base and tinny,"First, one must have an excellent and, literally, wet seal to hear anything. Second, what one hears is a great deal of high pitched tinny sound and inadequate base. The vacuum necessary to hear anything leads to mild then moderate discomfort after an hour or two of use. And all of this at a hefty price. These earphones are small but the cord is too long."
1,Great Expectations that Fell Flat,"I can't talk too much about this product without getting upset. I heard so many good things about these headphones, but, for me at least, they really aren't very good.In the documentation for these headphones, it says that you have to create a good seal in your ears to hear all the frequencies being played. Well, no matter how far I shoved these headphones into my ear I could not get a lick of bass. The middle frequencies are also distorted. Maybe I have weird ears, but they can't even hold a candle to the much cheaper Sony in-ear headphones. You should just be aware that you might also suffer similar problems."
1,Terrible for classical listening,"I was very excited to get these earphones in the mail today, and when I went to go try them out I was very dissapointed. I plugged them into my ipod to listen to classical music and to be honest, it sounded like the orchestra was playing out of a tin can. They did sound fine for pop and rock but as for the classical, it lacked big time. If you are like me and mostly listen to classical, i would NOT reccomend these earphones. They just don't have that full, clean, and pure orchestral sound that is needed for classical listening. I'm definately going to return these and use my old earphones which are far better for classical in my opinion ($20 Philips HE-592's -- haven't found any other in-ear 'phones better than these.)"
2,not as good as my sony earbuds and twice the price,"I am somewhat disappointed. The base response is less than I had hoped for, and these earbuds don't go very loud. Perhaps I should have bought the er-6i. I run long distance and I listen to rock like Led Zepplin, and I had thought these would be better than the Sony's I have - wrong. I did note that the high end is very precise. I suppose if you are into classical these these buds are for you."
2,Sounds great if you intend to only sit still and listen,"I loved the sound immediately (when I am standing still). However, I walk with my MP3 player as a part of my work commute requires doing so. And because of the way the ER6 is designed, there is no dissipation of accoustics generated from within (I guess that's the biproduct of good sound isolation), I hear a resonating thumping noise with every step. I have not tried jogging with them yet but I would assume that hearing the pounding of my heartbeat would drive me crazy. Also, the cords connecting to the buds are too fragile. I had returned the item immediately for fear that I may damage the delicate earbuds. Thank goodness for Amazon's great return policy."
3,Good NOT Great,"Good at blocking external noise and certainly better then the ear buds that you get with your ipod, BUT the bass could be much better and over all sound quality is good but certainly not great. I have had them for 6 months and the up side is they fit nicely into the ear and do block a lot of external noise."
3,Harry Potter Gryfindorf Pen Refills,Love the pen....HOWEVER finding refills is very difficult. Due to the lenght of the tip and narrowness/circumference of the plastic shaft....it is hard to find one which will fit into the metal tip. I tried Pilot ball point pen and it doesnt work. I may have to contact the actual Harry Potter catalog to find replacements!
3,I'm a huge Potter Fan,I was so excited to get this pen! I'm a huge fan.But clearly they did not make this to be actually USED as a pen. I used it a few times and the green coloring wore off the pen. I was disappointed by that.
4,Slytherin Pen,"Great looking pen, the only problem I see is the lack of a cap, but other than that, is the perfect gift for a HP fan."
3,It's okay.,"I wouldn't really recommend this book for a car trip. It has too many pieces that separate from the book...punch outs and stuff for games and it makes a mess in your car and they get lost. It had a few good things in it to pass the time, but I wouldn't purchase it again."
4,"Must-have reference for historians, collectors, reenactors",Peterson's book is still a most welcome addition to my reference library 44 years after its publication. The illustrations and diagrams alone justify the purchase.
4,"""You gotta make yourself come true.""","genre: historical fictionaudience: Advanced 5th grade readers and aboveEulinda, plantation house servant during the Civil War, grapples and discovers her identity and purpose as she transcends her plight and takes charge of her destiny.I wonder if Ann Rinaldi is the first writer for children to uncover the secret of the sexual exploitation of black women by their white owners during America's period of infamy? Mildred Taylor's THE LAND and Richard Peck's A RIVER BETWEEN US have followed. I applaud her.Southern society, the horrors of the Andersonville prison, and redemption by the remarkable Clara Barton color this engrossing story. An author's note contributes background for young readers but could do more.This is my first Rinaldi book to read. I was mesmerized. I look forward to reading her more."
5,Highly Recomended,"The best book I have ever read. How I found out about this book is because my teacher made me read it and usually when a teacher makes me read a book I hate it and don't want to read it, but this time it was amazing. I had so much fun reading it. I didn't want to put the book down. I just loved it. I was finished with the book when my lit circle group was only on pages 13-100.The book is about a 13 year old house slave who lives on a plantation and was born as the plantation owner's daughter. Her mother died when she was 6 years old and now she is 13, free and trying to make herself come true."
2,Numbering Alll The Bones,"The main charter is Eulinda. Eulinda's mom died when she was six. They live in Georgia on a plantation in 1864. Her brother is in jail a mile from the plantation. Miss Barton needs help raising the flag of color, so Eulinda helps since she has one brother in the hill(dead) and one sold to slavery.I would not recommend this book. It's too hard to understand. The books not very interesting, but I did like that the story had a chapter about the real people in that time period.I would Katarina, by Kathryn Winter; it's more informational and interesting."
4,A good read,I think Numbering all the Bones was a good book. It is about a slave girl who is trying to find her brother. The thing I like about the book was that you never really know what was going to happen. I think the book's message was never give up on your dreams.
1,Numbering All the Bones,"This book is what may be the most boring, tortuous 176 pages I have ever read! What's so bad about it is that it's so hard to follow, even for someone who enjoys reading. Normally, I appreciate books about the Civil War, but this book was just atrocious. Instead of ""Numbering All the Bones"", I was ""Numbering All the Pages Until the End""."
4,"Gran libro, inteligente autor","pienso que es un libro muy bueno, que realmente vale la pena leer. Destaco la gran capacidad del autor, para ver distintos puntos de vista y argumentarlos de la manera en que lo hace. Es el escritor mas inteligente que haya habido, y pienso que en este libro pone de manifiesto su capacidad intelectual."
2,Interesting but not engaging,"The novel looks at more priveleged members of English society. Often, Huxley deals with their relationships and ponderings of the impact of scientific developments on society. Much of this is done well. However, the book is not one that engrosses the reader. The book was a chore to finish.Despite having some interesting personality traits and views, I found the characters mostly boring. The characters seemed to lack vitality. Is that a characteristic of the portion of society of which Huxley wrote?"
3,Not Huxley's best,"Good but not great, this book starts off roaring with Walter leaving his expectant girl friend (who has left her husband!) for some man-eater. The book failed for me later with some of the other characters getting too politically involved and too pompous. The down to Earth parts of this book involving Lucy, Walter and others were wonderful. The tragedies at the end left me scratching my head."
4,This book pictures London upper class society in the late 20th.,"It's the second time that I am reading this book. I bought it after reading Ken Follet 2 books from his trilogy. They made me remember of this book. It's a wonderful book, better written than those of Follet. The way people think and act in the society is very accurate, you see human being from the inside, how we feel, think. I am sure we know a lot of the characters of this novel in the poeple we mingle with."
2,It's not a brave new world,"I love science fiction especially books like 1984, a brave new world, and Fahrenheit 451. Unfortunately, this book just never did it for me. I tried several times to pick it up and read it but never made it past page 50. It didn't catch me as well as the books just mentioned. I know it is unfair to judge a book that I haven't finished. However, I feel like it's important for those people who are considering this book due to a brave new world to know that this is not as entertaining or as fast paced as that book was."
5,Looks like the real thing.,"Was very pleased with this banana split. Looks very real. Use it for staging homes along with quite a bit of other ""fake"" foods. Excellent job."
5,Perfect doll for young toddler,"My daughter received this doll for her first birthday from Grandma. It took a couple of months for her to be interested in dolls, but now she LOVES it! It sleeps in her crib with her, so the fact that it's soft and cuddly is perfect.I will be buying some clothes (for the doll) for Christmas!"
1,Terminally Bizarre,"They laid the hip and avante garde on so heavy that the film collapses under the weight of it all. Some characters laugh incesstantly while others babble the same lines of dialog over and over again - for seemingly no other reason than to break with convention. These unconventional scenes backfire terribly and this is one silly, mess of a movie."
2,GLAM,I got the R rated one wanted nc-17. ( hope its better) slow no action too speak of. had a standout cast too.
4,Amazingly Well Written,"This book had alot of suspense, though I thought it was sort of boring at the start, it picked up and in the end I really liked it! It had a very good plot, and I loved the book."
2,False advertizing,"If the product is made out of die cast metal and requires paint, please say that in the ad instead of having an assembled painted picture."
4,Dads Christmas,I purchased this piece for my dad for Christmas. It was exactly what he wanted so he was very happy with it.
1,Did anyone at Easton read this book?,"Alas, so much of this book is taken up with white supremacist rants of the vilest sort that one wonders if Eckenrode was capable of any objectivity whatsoever. Whatever the merits and demerits of President Hayes, Easton wasted its leather-and-gold-leaf on this turkey."
2,Overly simplistic,"This book is overly simplistic even for linguists with no programming experience. The problem I had with it is that it had too few examples of applications that could be written to deal with linguistic research. It would have been good to offer a real world example of say a syntactic parser or the like. Functions which are particularly pertinent to linguistics should have been highlighted a lot more to be a better more effective manual for the non-programming linguist.Also, by leaving out technical details of perl it is harder for the non-programmer to go on to other perl sources. Overall I found this book to be an okay basic starter for a non-programmer, but not particularly useful for linguists who are interested in automating linguistic processes."
5,Incredibly moving,"Written after his death, ""The Gift of Peace"" is Joseph Cardinal Bernardin's reflections on the last three years of his life, during which he was accused of sexual misconduct, his accuser recanted, he was diagnosed and recovered from pancreatic cancer; and had to deal with the disease's recurrence, this time in his liver.The reflections are deeply moving, very personal and very helpful, especially to those who are ill or have recently lost a cherished friend or family member. His decision to stop treatment when he did reflects a wish to have his life end on his own terms. This book is wonderful: one can see why the Cardinal was so popular with his parishioners, and why he was such a great influence in the American Catholic Church. He will be missed."
5,fogelberg,"This video shows Dan at his best...his music is wonderful and he is healthy and his voice is strong. For anyone who's been to his concerts this will be a gentle (and a little sad) reminder. For those not fortunate enough to have seen him, this video is an excellent example of the music of this most beautiful artist."
5,Magnificient!,"As this video was unfortunately never sold in Europe, I had to go out and buy it in the original NTSC version in California during a summer vacation in 1995. Even though I had to get it copied to European PAL standard, it is a tape I treasure & never get tired of watching. Again, as DF has never made it across the ocean for a concert tour over here, the video is all have after 23 years of listening to the man's music to make up for never having been able to see him on stage. ""Greetings From the West"" is a wonderful 110 minute piece of concert footage, including some personal words from Dan and also a great selction of some of his best-loved tunes. It shows just what a great singer, musician & composer Dan Fogelberg is: tender ballads, energetic rockers and some very poetic lyrics - music that will never sound out of date. Excellent!"
3,"Great music, great songwriting...average sound","Overall, this performance is stunning, and a must have for any Dan Fogelberg fan. His voice sounds higher and different than most of the renowned studio songs, and that may surprise some, but there's no complaint about its quality. The songs are so fine, that one can help but wonder why Dan has been so overlooked and underrated as an artist and songwriter. It's a pity that this is the only way that we can hear Dan Fogelberg on DVD, because they didn't put a lot of work on the sound. As somebody said it here, this looks like a simple transfer from the VHS, a poor one in sound, and just acceptable in picture. Luckyly, most of the songs have an average sound, but the interview snippets and some of the songs have a very noticeable distortion. But it's hard not to enjoy the concert even having to go through the abscense of quality in the video. Come on, SONY MUSIC, is this the best that you can do?."
3,More Dan on DVD Please Sony,"I missed Dan playing support to the Eagles back in the 70's when for some unknown reason he never turned up. Being a D.F. Fan since first hearing Homefree I had to buy this DVD. However it was never released in European format so I had to wait until I moved Stateside. I was a little disappointed to find that half the songs on the CD were missing from the DVD (what you playing at Sony!). Never the less, it's the nearest thing to seeing him live.When are Sony or Full Moon going to release a full D.F. Concert in DVD format with decent Dolby sound? His Later material is just as good as ever and it's about time others got to see this unique artist in concert (including me!) As for only 3 stars, well if the sound quality was better and the DVD was as long as the album, it would have merited 5."
5,You'll love it!,"If you have never seen or heard Dan Fogelberg, you are in for a wonderful experience. I have the VHS version of this concert and have just purchased it on DVD. The picture is much better and, although I wish it came out on the 5.1 soundtrack, the 2.0 sounds wonderful. This is an artist with a beautiful voice. He is also a very talented musician and songwriter, and I fell in love with his music the first time I heard it.It is such a treat to see this great performance. I have been to many of his concerts, but this gives you a chance to see him up close, and he and his band are terrific. The music covers a wide span of his work, and there are songs, such as a few from his CD ""The Wild Places,"" that I have never heard at his other concerts.You'll enjoy every minute of it!"
4,Dan's Awesome,"I received this DVD from my sister for Christmas, 2007, just a few days after Dan's passing. It was exactly what I would have asked for and I burst into tears when I watched it. I have been a fan of Dan Fogelberg since the mid-70s when I was fortunate enough to see him live on stage in Cincinnati, Ohio, in a small theater. I fell in love with his music and his spirit that night but didn't have another opportunity to see him again. I have most of his recordings and to have this DVD as well is special to me. Other than to say that I wish the DVD lasted longer and covered more of his music, I have no criticism of it. Perhaps his widow will produce a DVD for his fans to enjoy. If you love Dan Fogelberg and his music, you'll love this DVD simply because it's about him."
3,RE-MASTER THIS IN 5.1,"TAKE THIS DVD BACK AND MASTER IT, MAKE IT GREAT, MAKE IT IN 5.1...Even Blu-ray...DAN DESERVES IT AND SO DO HIS FANS..."
3,Newer video please,This is not exactly what I wanted. Its a little outdated. I think a recent concert of his overall work would be great.
3,Done on the cheap,"The music is his usual great stuff. But this DVD appears to be pretty much a straight copy off a tape. The only extras are subtitles, a textual biography, and a discography. The sound is simple PCM stereo. The sound quality is less than wonderful. In the spoken word bits between the tracks the sound quality is frequently very poor. They also break up the flow in an undesirable way. They should have been shunted off to the extras section. Overall this DVD did nothing worthwhile to exploit the available technology. I probably won't buy another of Dan's DVDs until I see one with rave reviews of the DVD production values."
5,This is the best series by her by far!,"Chernevog, Rusalka, and Yvengie are the greatest books. I enjoyed the atmosphere. An old-time russian fairy-tale. This series pulled together bits of all folklore I know, and even taught me some things I wasn't aware of. The characters are likeable, even the truely evil ones. You can imagine where they are coming from and why it is they are acting like they are. Perhaps it is a bit predictable, but it's a fairy-tale."
1,"Yes, go on, keep on complaining","I had read Yvgenie years ago and enjoyed it. When this book became available I was excited to read more in the same vein. However, as previously stated, the characters have no growth, no empathy and create tension simply by fighting amongst each other constantly.Reading the book has become a chore.Also, the author's lack of confidence in our ability to learn vocabulary is a bit off putting. Can we not call every supernatural being a ""thing""? That's what nouns are for. You can introduce them like that if you like, but there are paragraph that read ""and the yard-thing did this and the forest-thing did that and the water-thing the other..."" Please! Use nouns, I beg of you.So, in short, prepare yourself for 200+ pages of unlikeable characters fighting with each other, muddled action and endless trudging through swamps and forests.I cannot say I would recommend this book to anyone."
2,Oddly unfulfilling,"I'm usually a big Cherryh fan, I have enjoyed everything else I have read by her. But Rusalka just left me cold. It seems to go on forever with the main characters bickering, to be brightened by momentary flashes of action after which ... the characters resume bickering."
3,"Yes, oddly unfilling","I agree that Rusalka is ultimately unfilling. I enjoyed the first half but ultimately, I felt that it just kind of petered out. Also, Cherryh's sentence structure was odd throughout the book, making it sometimes difficult to figure out what she meant."
3,Funny Moments,"A lot of funny moments but, it was a little flat this time around.Still....the series is very funny!"
5,Jeeves & Wooster- The Complete First Season,"Jeeves & Wooster- the First Season is ideal for anyone who loves Faulty Towers, Keeping Up Appearances, or any silly British comedy. My husband and I were so amused we ordered the second & third season immediately. It only gets better & better."
4,Outstanding British Comedy,"This is British wit at some of its best. Highly recommended for true lovers of British humor. I would also recommend this series for anyone curious in seeing Hugh Laurie as a well-meaning, loveable but dim-witted upper-class Brit vice the cynical Dr. House."
4,"Extremely Funny, Extremely Dry","These won't be for everyone. You'll need a fast, dry, sharp wit, otherwise, you're liable to fall asleep having missed all of the humor. The video quality is tolerable, but grainy. I say this because every DVD I've seen in my Panasonic (DMP-BD65) has up-scaled extremely well, but the player can't make these look better than grainy, VHS quality. But that's O.K., because Jeeves is worth the price. Top drawer.I would note here, that some criticised the ""complete set"" of having an inferior transfer quality, and claimed that the single season disks were superior. That advice is rubbish. If the ""complete set"" was any worse than this set, in picture quality, I'd send them back to the studio just for the satisfaction of telling them to get stuffed."
4,"JEEVES & WOOSTER, SEASON ONE","I watched the original series on TV many years ago and bought the DVD for my daughter, who is a huge Hugh Laurie fan. Hugh Laurie as Bertie Wooster was so convincing you can't imagine him in any other role - till you see him in ""House,"" where he is so convincing you can't believe he ever did Bertie. My favorite is Jeeves, though. The music is lively and infectious, the sets are gorgeous, and the story line and characters are just goofy but refreshing."
5,tyrjerker,"Loved watching a young Hugh Laurie, although Jeeves was the star of this show. I seem to remember though a different first episode, with Jeeves tricking(?) Wooster into hiring him. Oh well still an excellent series."
5,I'm in it for the long haul with this one,"Ever since I got this CD three weeks ago, it has been in my truck's CD player. I drive every day to and from work about 30 miles. I have not tired of this CD even after so many times through. Simply amazing! Very diverse selection on this album, but all good."
4,Romance during the revolution,"Set on the coast of North Carolina during the revolution, this book mixes real history with interesting characters to make the story come alive. Two men working for opposite sides, one for the British and one for the colonists, have a relationship with the same woman. Their relationship comes to a climax during the battle at King's mountain. Mrs. Fletcher knew the area and the history intimately and writes with skill that is not dated. Planters living near swamps using boats for transportation with descriptions of the plants and animals, open door hospitality, and later divisions within the characters as they are forced to decide whether to support the British or join the colonist when war reaches their homes. This is an excellent choice for those who like historical fiction."
3,just for laughs,"This is a no-brainer movie, just for fun. The kids love it and I can not get them to stop doing the cheers. This DVD is on their birthday wish list, (2 girls 10yrs old)."
3,Cheerleader Mania,"I viewed this movie twice. It is one that will grow on you and make you watch it many times over. The first time I thought it was a stupid cheerleading movie as you watch it for story content. But, the second time you watch it for the actual cheerleading and purely for entertainment. I think it's one you will watch over and over again."
3,Cheerleader Crazy-Stuff,"Usually, when I'm reading reviews I like short and to the point ones and thats what I'm trying to do here (And in all my reviews) so this movie got a 3/5 because it was fun. The music was great. It was interesting, sort of funny. Um ...Overall: Don't even think about it if your not into predictable -wacky -teenage - cheerleader movies."
2,"""Ice cold."" 2 stars.","I love to hate this damn movie. Sure it was nice and pleasant the first two go rounds but now I'm sick of it. I'd rather watch any of the Spider-Man movies twice than this load of bullocks.I appreciate it because Blaque a fun R&B-Pop; band that is in hiding these days, Elisha and Gabrielle are in it. But that's not enough.It's cheesy, and just plain stupid. A few studs are also in it which is cool. But that's where the fun ends.Cover Art: C+Story: C+Characters: B-Comedic Value: DLength: D-Overall: D-2 stars."
5,"I'm sexy, I'm cute, I'm popular to boot...!",'Bring It On' is the story of two cheerleading teams who try to make it to a cheerleading championship. But 'The Toros' find it hard when they discover that all of their cheer routines have been stolen from another team. They have to work together to really come up with something original.I love this movie! Kirsten Dunst is cute. The movie is fun. The opening cheerleading sequence is one of the many highlights of this wonderful film. The direction is appropritely paced.Has enough in it to keep boys and girls happy.So 'Bring It On!'
5,Funny Funny Funny!,I really liked this movie! It's so funny and entertaining it feels about 10 minutes long. The opening cheer is absoulutely hilarious. I recommend this to everyone!
4,A chick flick guys can enjoy,"Bring It On is a chick flick, that guys can enjoy. The hot chicks includeing Claire Kramer and Kristen make this movie. Not only that but it's funny as hell and has a great plot. First time director Peyton Reed handled the film very well and even though he didn't have another hit film until 2006's The Break Up this is still his best."
4,Teen Movie with catchy dialog and Characters,"This movie is mostly targeted towards teens so only rent or buy if you like movies with a high school setting like ""Clueless"". I won't cover the details of the movie (Amazon's review is good enough) but I have the DVD, and it holds up to multiple viewings and kind of grows on you. It has catchy cheers in it, especially the opening one. The opening cheer/song sets the tone for the whole movie and gets you in the mood. The story is fairly unique since it focuses on Cheerleading, and so it is fresh.This is a 5 star DVD with all of the extra's (DTS and Dolby Digital, Making of, Deleted Scenes, Music Video, Extra car wash scenes, etc.). I give it a qualified 4 stars in this genre (I'd give Clueless 5)."
4,Funny fluff with some laughs,"Yes, I adore this teenage comedy wth a great young cast that includes Dunst and Dukshu. I love the feel of this cute little movie with appeal. I love watching it."
4,Spirit Fingers,"I first saw this movie about 10 years ago in the theater with friends. This DVD replaces my VHS copy. Yes it's silly, but it's a funny movie. My friends and I still quote ""Bring It On"" all these years later. The original is far better than the sequels!"
4,It Brought it!,"This movie was probably the most fun this summer. all the people who bash it were expecting it to be like titanic, or another boring classic. but why do we need so many serious movies? this one makes you feel care-free and makes you wanna get up and dance! good performances, and a funny spoof on cheerleaders. I think you should see it, but don't expect it to be all serious."
4,"Good movie, Great DVD","This is a good, fun movie. It does have a message, but it keeps things light, so as not to get preachy. The movie doesn't just accept the negative stereotype of cheerleaders. Like, for example, football players, some cheerleaders are nice and some are not, and we get to see versions of each here. My two favorite parts of the film were the opening dream sequence cheer and the closing blooper/gag reel over the end titles to the song ""Mickey."" The movie was a bit predictable and could have used more cheer routines, but it was still very good.Aside from a good movie, the DVD is packed with features. The director's commentary was witty and informative. He also introduced the deleted and extended scenes to explain why they were cut or shortened. The ""Did you know that?"" feature displays facts on screen as the movie plays, along the lines of the ""Pop-up Videos"" of VH1. This one is well worth the money!"
4,"Its cold in here, there must be some toros in the atomsphere","This is a great film, you wont be disapointedmy fave line from it is.........""im cute, im hot im everything your not, im witty great hair the boys all like to stare""See you are granted a laugh!So go buy it"
4,Cheers,"I loved the cheerleading parts, but the story lines were a little over the top and in-your-face. I suppose the teens would like that O.K., but it gets a little old. The cheerleading sequences make it all worth it, however."
4,"""Bring on the fun""","The movie ""bring it on"" with the amazing Kirsten Dunst, is a great movie full of fun and laughts.The plot is about a young teeange girl which is the leader of a cheerlating team. they meet many problems and deals with them.we liked this movie, because it is fun to watch. it has lots of catchy songs and sweet actress.we recommend you to see this movie - it's great!"
3,a simple little piece that has fun with itself,"I liked this movie more than I thought I would. It is a simple little piece that has fun with itself. It also helps that it is well acted (Dunst is excellent, even in this suger candy role). ""Bring It On"" should especially appeal to the teenage audience and/or those insterested or involved in competative cheerleading. Overall an enjoyable watching experience if you don't expect too much depth from it."
4,Kirsten Dunst and Cheerleaders!?! Oh yeah!!!,"True, the movie doesn't have a great plot.Basically it has to do with this: the 5-time defending national cheerleading champions, the Rancho Carne Toros have discovered that all their routines are in fact stolen and must come up with new routines before facing the rival East Compton Clovers in the National Cheerleading Championship. Leading them on this crusade is new captain Kirsten Dunst. Along the way, she grows some as a person by finding humility and love too. What teeny-booper movie doesnt have the star finding love during the movie?But dont the plot trick you. Its about the cheerleaders. one of the opening scenes is in the locker room. 5-stars there. No nudity as in all Kirsten's movies. Sometimes not seeing is better."
2,An Interesting Attempt at Humor,"Kirsten Dunst (Interview with a Vampire) heads this film as the newly chosen Captain of a champion cheerleading squad. She thinks it's all well and good until she learns that her unique cheers were stolen by the old captain from a rival school. Packed with a few laughs, some good cheers, and some cheerleading bashing. This movie is as good as it could be."
3,Hey Hey it's ok! You're gonna pump our gas someday!,Good natured fluff about cheerleading at a San Diego high school. Kirsten Dunst makes the movie fun to watch.the outtakes at the end are not funny-they never are.
4,Gift,"Daughter has been wanting this movie since it came out, finally bought it as a stocking stuffer. Packaged well, plays without scratches et al, correct edition."
4,Bring it on,I bought the movie for my niece.It's her favorite movie.She watched it so much it got scratched when she left it out so I had to buy another one.
3,jesse bradford,"the first time i noticed jesse bradford was in ""Swimfan"" but i think he was hot in this too. i really like the dance routines and stuff. but its not the best teen movie."
4,Three Cheers for Bring It On!!,"The Toro cheerleading squad has spirit, spunk, sass, and a killer routine that's sure to land them the national championship torophy fo the sixth year in a row. But for newly-elected team captain, Torrance, the Toro's road to cheer glory stumbles when she discovers their perfectly choreographed routines were stolen from a hot hip-hop squad across town. Now the squad must stumble to find a new routine to compete in this year's competition.This movie is sassy, fresh, and funny! It is a great buy for anyone who loves cheerleading or just an all around cheerful movie!!***Check it out!***"
5,BEST MOVIE,I loved this movie. Lets just say that I sat in fron tof the tv and watched this video about 6 times. I know evry chear every dance every word ever said in this movie! It is by far my favorit I suggest everybody go out and buy it or rent it!!
3,BRING IT ON...............PLEASE,"Not a bad movie to pass a Thursday night, but unfortunately just leaves you wanting a little more oomph.Kirsten Dunst plays this role well, maybe a little to well.Supporting cast aren't bad - Eliza Dushku being the bit of guts it's needs, unfortunately she mellows out too much.Still a feel good movie, proving that doing the right thing always makes us feel a tingle of satisfaction.Not alot of thought required on behalf of the viewer, which is always a good thing every now and then.Enjoy!"
2,boring,this movie was sooooo boring. only thr beginnging was funny. its ok if you watch it once or twice but then you have to throw it out.
1,Too bad 1 star is the lowest available ranking....,"I rented this movie with low expectations, I mean, how good could a cheerleader movie be? Well, not only was it not good, it was HORRIBLE. Kirsten Dunst was the stiffest, most irritating cheerleader I have ever seen. If you miss the opening cheer (1st scene), then you miss the best part of the movie...and even this scene is bad. Save your money and spend the night staring at the wall, it will be more interesting than this movie."
2,Holds your interest just long enough to disappoint you,"The clever, sneering cheer that opens BRING IT ON got my hopes up. As the beautiful young women play to the camera, cheering about how they've got it all - and how you would like to either be one of them or have one of them - I thought I was in for a funny, sexy look at the politics of high school popularity and the competition for it. Alas, BRING IT ON slowly winds down to a TV-movie level story where everyone has to win and no one looks bad. Yet it's worth seeing for its strengths, namely the athletic cheers and especially 18-year old Kirsten Dunst's stunningly attractive torso, which BRING IT ON shows aplenty. I don't think there's a midriff-baring outfit available that the fair-skinned beauty Miss Dunst doesn't wear in this film!"
1,Gimme a S...gimme an H...gimme an I...,"So the movie starts out with the conflict being between the blond cheerleaders and this brunette street kid who wants to be on the team. OK, we got it. Barbie vs. Jo from Facts of Life. But then what happens? Less than halfway through, the blond team has to go up against a team of black cheerleaders, and so now the street kid bonds with the blondes and what happened to the original conflict?! Does anyone reading this care about screenwriting? If so, and you saw this movie, could you give it more than one star? Why? Who in the cast are you related to?"
1,Utter Trash,"This movie is so completely worthless, I really don't know what to say. I am all for fun movies, but this plot is so overly contrived, and stereotypical, that even in fun I couldn't enjoy it. Spend your time doing something fun...unless you are a guy who likes to look at girls in cheerleading outfits. Then I would suggest playing it without sound. However, the actual footage of cheerleading is also minimal. Maybe if they had spent more time showing actual cheerleading and less time trying to build some lame plot, it would have been better."
1,horrible blonde mess,"What a flop. How could this aimless, trashy movie get any high ratings? A tasteless movie with the usually smiley airhead Kirsten Dunst, once again proving she is good for nothing other than standing there and looking stupid. Certainly gave females everywhere a bad name. If you have only a few brain cells in your head and are still in 10th grade, go check it out."
1,Terrible. Just a bunch of snooty girls,"This film is awful. It is not appropiate for children at all. There is a lot of teen girls acting up in a sexual way and in a snotty way. One thing this movie is right about though is what cheerleading has been allowed to become in this country. Cheerleading is supposed to be about cheering. In this film and in reality today its a bunch of teen girls talking about sex, boys and being a bunch of snobs. This movie is terrible and why it became popular I'll never know. Its awful and not worth the price."
1,is there a rating of L for laim???,"kirsten dunst went from bad to worse...from vampire slaying to cheerleder slaying..my 2 teens droped interest the first 45 min.I never saw that much spirit in any of our cheerleaders in highschool,and the movie is the same old material and plots used in many movies to hit the screens.the kids these days will never go for it.Which is worst i ask you?????coyote ugly or this....only my opinion,but its got to count somewheres........."
3,interesting! simple! sexy!,"This movie is a typical style of hollywood. It is just good for amusement. Especially, active movement of highscool cheerleaders is a nice material for curiosity, but the flow of content is not getting over a level of simple youth movie. You can see just a trick of the business through sexy women and sex-appealing scenes. Don't think when you watch this movie. Because if you think anything about this movie, you will be not able to get a interest.Just watch movie without thinking, and enjoy your time."
2,I'm embarassed,"I am embarassed to admit that I saw this video several years ago; I give it 2 stars. I suppose the film quality is excellent, but in my opinion, a waste of film to make this. The plot is forgettable, and, at the risk of offending those who like it, ""I spent two hours out of my life watching this, and can't get them back again for something constructive."""
2,Not much to it.,"This is a disappointing movie about cheerleading as a sport. You have the expected competition between the school with money and the school without funds for after-school programs such as cheerleading. The high-end school can purchase the services of a choreographer to create their routine for the annual cheer leading competition. The ""poor"" school scores financing by getting their story out to the media. The cheerleaders deliver their competing routines. That's about it. This movie isn't appropriate for pre-teens who I see would be the only interested audience. It would have needed some character development to provide an interesting movie to anyone over the age of 13."
2,"""Give Me an S-I-L-L-Y""","What does that spell? BRING IT ON. Kirsten Dunst and the girls are cute, probably the main reason most teenagers like this movie. It reminded me of CLUELESS, except the title gave you a little insight into the quality of the picture. Another poor characterization of cheerleaders, whom I respect as being intelligent students, competitive athletes, and future leaders. The movie struggled for plot and was just plain silly. I was begging someone not to BRING IT ON, but to TAKE IT AWAY."
4,Not Another Teen Movie....thankfully.,"""Bring It On"" is a suprisingly enjoyable, funny, and smart teen comedy that is much better than you might expect. While not the raunchy comedy that ""American Pie"" is, it has a lot of charm, and the cheerleading segments are quite entertaining. Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku carry the movie, with two excellent and believeable performances.Just so you know, I am not a fan of teen movies, so I approached this movie with a lot of doubt. Kids and teenagers will enjoy this movie for the trendiness and mainly teenage cast. But if nothing else motivates you, there are plenty of cute girls in very short skirts.The DVD package is a bit light on the extras. There are some deleted scenes (very short ones), some test screenings, and some extra footage of the famous ""car wash"" scene. Other than that, the movie is the only other perk. But I enjoyed this movie enough to see it a few times over, so it is well worth the price of the DVD."
1,Destined to Become a Cult Classic...,"although unlike other cult classics (e.g., ""Harold and Maude"", ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show""), the producers of this trivial piece of divinity, focused on making a quick buck, appear to have been unaware of just how lousy a film they were putting together.Having suffered through two other films featuring Kirsten Dunst (""Dick"" and ""Drop Dead Gorgeous""), I'm beginning to see a pattern in the roles she plays -- a cute, though certainly not beautiful, little airhead who smiles a lot and engages in vapid conversation. I suspect that she is as she appears.Unless you're frozen at age 14, look elsewhere for your entertainment."
1,I can't even explain,"WOW - I don't think I have laughed so hard since I saw The Naked Gun; the only difference is this film is not a comedy (or maybe it is)? I don't know where to begin, this film even gives me confidence that I can write a script and sell it to studio execs. No plot, no story, no character development - if your looking for an upbeat film of this sort you mind as well stay at home and tape the Sunday USA movie of the week which nine times out of ten will be The Karate Kid Part 2 or The North Shore, both of which still make me shed a tear each time I see them."
1,Coffee table book,"If you like books that have beautiful pictures, then get this one and put it on your coffee table. Do not bring it into the kitchen. The first recipe I tried failed, wasting the ingredients. Before trying a second, I checked with another cookbook and modified the Canyon recipe accordingly. The book lacks the little tips that are frequently necessary to make things perfect."
5,Wow!,"I have fallen in love with this cookbook! The recipes are delicious (the lemon chicken recipe yielded a PERFECT chicken!) and even my meat-and-potatoes husband has thoroughly enjoyed the healthy meals. The stilton and pear salad was a hit at a dinner party and everything I make from this book just gets better and better. I was expecting hours of work for just one recipe but even with starting from scratch it wasn't bad. And, the book is beautiful to boot."
2,Catchy at first but ultimately twee and annoying,"With it's harmonica touches and fairly typical guitar stylings this is a departure from Finley's earlier releases. And on first listen it is sprightly and catchy enough. But before long you realise hat it has little melody or style to it. And the lyrics, about Finley's joy at being a dad, are embarassingly fey and lame, the type of stuff an artist should keep to themself. The very concept of Finley doing a Black Sabbath cover is bizarre, and the results are unsuccessful there too."
3,wrestling cotton shoe,dear sirplease send for me catalog and prices sport equipment.thank youb-aghazadeh
2,OK but,"A nice reach and good for scraping most but hard ice that is too much for the plastic edge. The removable squeegee is far too stiff, cleans poorly and doesn't conform to curved surfaces."
4,"Good, but noisy","I don't know if anyone else will have this problem; the scraper and squeegee both work really well, but the squeegee makes this really high pitched squeal when you use it. And when you have neighbors close by and try to use it at 6 am, it's pretty loud."
1,What a Waste Of Time - What A disappointment,"I should have read all the reviews before I bought it. I live in Australia and I had to import it. Arriving yesterday I eagerly sat down to watch and got the same reaction as the other 1 star review. What a wasted opportunity. I love music from that era and I thought I would be in for a treat especially as Gary Clark was involved. BIG MISTAKE. I'm not sure what the movie was supposed to be about, it sure wasn't about the music. Roosevelt Sykes would be rolling in his grave."
5,x,"a great family move, wounderful look into the blues and rock-n-roll era. ther was action adventure history and most important romance."
2,Not what it claimed to be!,"I bought this to have a set of quick change drill bits for use in a manual hex drive handle. Great for drilling holes in P/C boards and deburring holes in metal drilled with an electric drill.It clearly states in ""What's in the Box"" (14) 1/4-inch Hex Titanium Drill Bits. Well I'm afraid not!! The only hex drive bits in the set I received were the 5 paddle bits. So this 71 piece quick-change set is actually a 52 piece quick-change set and 19 pieces that you have to chuck up the old method.I gave this a two Star rating because it does have a neat little carrying case, and the quick change sockets might come in handy. Since I already have a drawer full of crap, like those driver bits, I'll probably never get around to testing these."
2,Cheaply made,"Lots of bits, but cheaply made. I used a small bit and it broke on the 5th hole I was drilling. It's inexpensive, so not worth returning, but not a quality product."
3,Nice Package - Drill Bits are BRITTLE,"The idea for this package is great. And most of the pieces work well. However, the drill bits are the most brittle things I have worked with. They survived wood but not metal or fiber glass. Wear protective glasses these things shatter."
5,Great Drill/Driver Set,"I bought this set for taking with me when I don't want to bring my entire set of tools with me. It works great, has most the common sizes and bits that I use the most, and comes in a sturdy compact case that I can leave in my truck or throw in a drawer in the garage. The dill bits have stayed sharp through a decent amount of use. The drivers seem to be made out of quality metal as they have not worn at all. The quick change system is also way better than Craftsman or Dewalt, as the mechanism does not accidentally release. I would recommend this set to anyone, and for the low price, it is hard to beat."
4,Nice,Real nice set. lots of different bits and attachments. The drill bits break if you drop them. 4 stars due to quick change drill bit. would be nice if they made it so you could replace bits easily.
1,Surprised...Don't buy this...,"I recently purchased this with an 18v Hitachi drill on here. When it came, I was excited. The case design is very cool. But then I began using the drill bits...They flex like crazy and arent sharp at all. They can't go through thin sheet metal and slip in wood. I broke off both allen head driver bits immediately, the torx have held up well though. I have a $40 dewalt kit that is 80x nicer than this. Don't buy this kit. I'm surprised Hitachi even put their name on this because every other tool I've used by them was very nice."
1,Is NOT A Companion for Hitachi DB3DL 3.6 vlt Cordless Drill!!!,"I bought this set for my husband, along with the drill. Amazon was suggesting that the two worked together,so I thought the set with additional options would be nice to add to the gift.NOPE!!!!!!!!Because of the configuration, you cannot insert the majority of the bits into this drill.Don't buy this set to use in conjunction with the drill they say it works with.IT DOES NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not as shown in ad,I just received this 71 piece drill/driver set by Hitachi and none of the drill bits are quick change. Do not be deceived by the picture clearly showing otherwise.http://www.amazon.com/Hitachi-728704-71-Piece-Drilling-Driving/product-reviews/B000LEJGM8/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=1
1,Not hex shank & cheaper at Costco.,I usually never write reviews but I hope no one else buys these also thinking they are 1/4 hex shank bits. The image and description are not the same as to what I received. I did receive a 71 piece set but they were not 1/4 hex shank and therefore would not work with my driver which has a 1/4 hex chuck. Retuned it for a refund and gonna find a different set.Update** 2/6/11: I saw this EXACT set at my local Costco for $19.99
3,"Eh, this set is good but you can buy others","Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against this set but honestly, these are all so closely related I scarcely view one being that far superior to another. The set is handy and the case is terrific but some of the drill bits broke pretty easily and the masonry bits burned up pretty fast. Overall, these sets all contain such disposable items you might as well just buy the cheapest (reputable brand) one you can find. That one from pep boys, that's a no no."
3,NOT WHAT IS PICTURED!,Please do not order this kit. The image is NOT what you get. It is still a cool kit but does not come with the quick change chuck (90% of why I bought it). It is still a 71 piece set but is also really disappointing.
2,Inaccurate description,"As someone else commented previously the drill bits are standard round ones, not 1/4-inch hex. It would be fine if the package included a 1/4-inch hex chuck adapter but it doesn't. Didn't have a chance to test the quality of the other parts since I'm returning it."
3,A touching personal story,"Kirsten Kingdon has written a moving novel based on her own experiences as a mother of a gay man and a leader in the efforts to obtain full recognition for gays in her church. Recent controversies in the Presbyterian Church make this book quite topical as well. Although the book is not first-rate fiction, it is a good read and should be attractive to anyone trying to reconcile the conflicts between organized religion and homosexuality."
2,Ship Needs Better Instructions,"I purchased this product to give to a sailor who served on the Saratoga. Although I have built items like this before, this product presented a challenge. It comes with over 180 pieces which are numbered, but the numbers are random and often fell off the pieces, leaving a lot of guesswork. I could not find the described paints in any craft store so I was forced to choose my own colors. The instructions, or, in this case, the lack of, made the project difficult to complete. The entire process is done without written instructions to accompany the visual guidelines. While the visuals did assist, they were, by far, not helpful in placing some of the smaller pieces. This project is not for the novice and the owner must wade through the process with less than desirable instructions."
4,ouch.,"harsh dissonant death metal. technical insanity thats hard to follow. its not particularly catchy, but its just cool. hard to explain really. a rather early willow tip release."
2,Disapointing,"This is great if your into Edgar Cayce. If your not into him, dont get this book. It is mostly filled with Cayce's prophecies, not with a more scholarly approach. I was looking for more Egyptological content. But hey that's me.."
3,"Mary, Did You Know?","Not a big fan of most of these songs, group sounds good--I love close harmony--but bought for just the one song."
5,Hey Wap-A-Beepy-Bop-A-LouwaO-Yea!! Aeeaah!! Aaah!!! Ahhh!,"That's my imitation of the opening vocal of ""Meadows"". For quite some time, it was the last tune I'd play back then when closing time came at the record store and it was played hot on the heels of ""Rocky Mountain Way"", with the volume cranked to 11, I might add.We all needed that kind of break to get ourselves out of the work frame of mind and into the rest of our lives. The early '70s had much that was positive, but also plenty to worry about. The overall tone of The Smoker You Drink fit seamlessly into the fabric of early 70's life and that's a huge part of what makes it a rock classic. Joe was on a roll! This is another record that today could easily be rated 4 or even 3 stars, but in the context of its release, is a solid 5."
5,Best I've heard this album sound.,"I haven't listed to this album in years, but it's always been one of my favorites. Some of the songs on this album appear on various best-of CDs, but the sound quality on those CDs leaves much to be desired. When I saw this Audio Fidelity Gold CD from the original masters, I decide to fill a hole that's been in my collection for a while (I used to have this album on cassette, but I couldn't tell you how long it's been since I owned a cassette player).All I have to say is this sounds great, the best I've heard it. Mr. Mojorisin said the Ultimate MasterDisc version is better, but I can't speak to that, as I've never heard it. I do know this version sounds better than he made it out. Could it be better? Maybe, but if you're a fan of this album, I don't think you'll be disappointed in this version.My only quibble is I wish they had released it on SACD"
1,Still don't like it,"When I was younger I remembered this album. Being older now I wondered why I didn't have it. Now I know. I would not consider this a rock album, the songs are to mellow and sort of dreamy. Having said that ""Rocky Mountain High"" is excellent. But you would be better off finding this song in a compilation with other good songs by other artists. The name of the album is the most imaginative part of the whole thing."
3,GOOD BUT NOT BEST,"""Rocky Mountain Way"" is the best cut hands down. The work is uneven, however, because there are several stinkers: ""Wolf"" (a depressing largo tempo can really drag you down), ""Midnight Moodies"" (a throaway), and ""Dreams."" Nevertheless, SMOKER stands head and shoulders above its predecessor, BARNSTORM."
4,"The listen you more, the like it you are...","As a long time Joe Walsh/James Gang fan, this is a disc that I never got around to picking up. Better late than never. It's chocked full of great tunes, even the ones that don't get played on the radio are pure joy to listen to. Lots of ear candy."
4,Joe Walsh was a bit of a rocker before the Eagles.....especially with the James Gang,"But this ain't the James Gang, but most fans of Joe like it very much and I'm not going to rate it down just because I like the title better than most of the tracks....its a good plus."
3,Smoker You Drink the Player You Get by Joe Walsh,"More good music from Joe Walsh dating from the early 70's. Knew him, through my Sister and brother in law at the time and he has been a very talented rocker that was, as it seemed, in the right place at the right time. Good licks and tunes for those who like good mid western music of the Ohio vein."
5,Can't get it out of my head,"Since the price dropped to 5 bucks for this classic, it became a must buy. In truth, this is a weaker offering by Joe but it's great to listen to and put youself in that 70's frame of mind. Glad I bought it."
3,Average,"There's nothing wrong with the product, but some of the songs are obscure and not his best work. I probably woulnd't have bought this if I'd heard it beforehand and I definately wouldn't give it as a gift."
4,Dandy.,"Who isn't curious about Andy Warhol - and who wouldn't have loved to be in the pop guru's spotlight - even if only for fifteen minutes. . .Only this time he got into the head of someone whose mind was, though equally delusional, fatally monomaniacal.. . .and what's not to like about this movie - the acting was superb, Andy's little kingdom was brought vicariously back to life and the sad, twisted finale to his inflammatory life left me feeling conspicuously self conscious about my own delusions."
4,The S.C.U.M. Manifesto,"I cannot say in any other words how phenomenal Lili Taylor's performance was in this film. This flick was based on the true fact of Valerie Solanas who actually did shoot Warhol. After the shooting, Andy never quite recovered very well, and his health was fragile. As to Valerie, I must correct those that call her a feminist, because the true definition of a feminist is someone that believes in equality for both male and female. Valerie was a male basher, she hated men, and if she could of had it her way she would of (...) every man that crossed her way. Valerie was a delusional maniacal nut case with plenty of sex abuse issues and so on, however you end-up sympathizing for her in the film. Harris's role as Warhol along with Dorff's Candy Darling (who's very convincing as a drag queen) perfect the well put together film directed by Mary Harron. This film is decadent and brilliant, and you can watch it several times before you tire of it."
4,Revealing the S.C.U.M. manifesto,"Excellent indy pic with outstanding performances especially by Dorf, Harris and Taylor, all excellent small-budget mainstays. I liked Harris' portrayal of Warhol, because he's usually represented by someone who just acts aloof and goofy, but here he actually works as a person. Stephen Dorf as Candy Darling and Lili Taylor as Valerie Solanas are entirely convincing. This movie started director Mary Harron's reputation for skillful storytelling, and it was later cemented by her work 'American Psycho.' I greatly anticipate her next film.The Amazon critic here criticized Harron for not taking a stand on Solanos and the S.C.U.M. manifesto. Why? The movie's not about the manifesto, but Solanos' bizarre character and the story of how she shot Warhol. This is done to a T.Great flick!"
4,Of Andy Warhol (?) New York Tale,"An American story of aiming a popularity (and money) by any means possible as lone feminist came to New York, employed by Andy Warhol and taken ""revenge"" over a boss having her works seemingly ""stolen"".Nice performing, also Andy Warhol looked a bit different thanscreened usually."
4,I Shot Andy Warhol,"This is an excellent flick with great performances by Lili Taylor and Stephen Dorff. Fans of indie-rock will enjoy seeing Yo La Tengo performing as The Velvet Underground at Warhol's Facory, which was perfectly depicted in this film."
1,I SHOT LILI TAYLOR..,"I SHOT LILI TAYLOR AFTER I HAD TO SIT THROUGH THIS MOVIE.. I WAS TEMPTED TO SHOOT MYSELF, BUT I FELT IT MY DUTY TO STAY ALIVE & WARN THE REST OV THE WORLD TO AVOID ANY MOVIE THAT SHE HAS ACTED IN!!(EXCLUDING THE MOVIE ""PECKER"" WHICH I ONLY TOLERATED HER BECAUSE IT WAS A JOHN WATERS FILM & HER PART WAS BRIEF)"
3,Lack of ambition!,"I shot Andy Warhol was by itself a fortunate idea but to my view, wasted the fabulous opportunity to show both sides of the coin. And the script would seem to be much more interested around the tragic anima and the psychical disturbances of the woman in question rather than to remark Warhol' s relevance in the Pop Art. Perhaps the aim was to consider his murder as simply a departure point, as historical reference and nothing else."
1,"I'm sorry to say it, but I HATED THIS MOVIE!","This movie was the most disgusting and odd movie I've ever seen. My only regret is that it stars my favorite actress, Lili Taylor. To all you Lili fans out there, I apologize deeply. This was the only movie I think I've ever totally disliked."
1,Do not buy this movie,"Horrible. Absolutely horrible. If there was a choice for ""no stars"" I would have picked it."
5,Two words... Alex O'Loughlin,"I love a good horror movie, but that is not why I bought this! It's good... but Alex O'Loughlin is so adorable and sexy... I would pay to watch him read the phone book!!! Seriously, the Southern accent is spot on, and he is as cute as they come! Great actor - gorgeous man! Win Win!!!"
5,Awesome movie,Man-Thing is an awesome movie. i think that marvel should of released this movie in theaters. i know it's a little cheesy but it's better than some movies that came out that year. this is an awesome movie. i would like to see more of this character. if you have not watched this movie then i recommend you do
4,Man-thing...or something better?,"I bought this video not knowing this movie had ever been made.I feel the comic book character Man-thing was mis-represented in the movie, but guess what? This made the movie 90 times better than I was expecting. Marvel comics about this character have NEVER been very good reading...it's nice to see that they followed alot of the character guidelines for the story, but dumped almost everything about the Man-thing that had been written for 30 years, & it worked!"
3,Meh,"I saw this movie on Sci Fi last night, and it was better than I espected. Though dull and boring later in the film, the movie's intriguing character makkes up for it. Plus, the special effects are not that bad. BUT, it was a good call to not put it in theaters. The listt below will sum up most of the good and bad things about the movie.GOODNot bad special effectsMan Thing looks a little better in the movie than he does in the comicsInteresting endingClassic movie scare scenesGood job on Man Thing detailsBADSlow pacedSometimes choppy writingNot enough Man Thing(you wait an hour to even get a glimpse of him)This Man Thing is not even Man Thing! They have nothing in common, I mean.Too many Man Thing close upsMan Thing's head looks funny"
3,Man-Thing,"All-in-all the movie was pretty good; it wasn't as bad as some of the reviews I've read on some web-sites. It had a good story, it was pretty gory, even though I liked the old look, Man-Thing had a cool new look, which worked, and it at least mentioned that Man-Thing was guardian of the Nexus. The only things that I'd add or change would be: 1. I'd add something about Man-Thing's origins. 2. I would of used Man-Thing's original powers, where when he sensed a hostile environment, his skin would produce an acid ,which would neutralize when things calmed down. This leads me to 3. I would of used ""whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing's touch"" when the legend is 1st spoken of, which couldn't be used since he didn't have his original powers. finally, 4. I would of had more scenes using Man-Thing. It may of not been Marvel's best, but it still came out pretty good for being one of Marvel's lower-budget films."
4,"Better than Daredevil or Punisher, that's for sure.......","Who'da thought, a Man Thing movie?!?!? Here is a marvel adaption that could be described as a real admirable effort in bringing a comic to the big screen it's and much much more watchable than some of the other embarassing Marvel adaptions of late(Daredevil, Punisher, Fantastic Four)...Great location filming, stylish comic book photography/lighting and a few touches of hillbilly swamp humor scattered throughout make it an easy one to watch. Don't miss it...."
2,"The Man Thing is cool, the rest of the movie not so much","A new sheriff comes to the swamps of Louisiana to what he thinks is a quiet place only to find out dozens of people have disappeared including the last sheriff. A local family has bought Indian land and is destroying it to build rigs on it. Nature has formed a creature to take revenge.The Man Thing in the movie is pretty cool. A great design and good effects. The rest of the movie doesn't live up to it. The characters are all cliches, the story has no depth and the acting is low-rent. This isn't the worst movie you'll ever see but it's not good."
3,Not bad,Never even knew this movie existed. I watched it with three buddies who knew nothing of Man-Thing. They all thought it was pretty good. I didn't think it was a bad movie. I bought it for $1.26 and I thought it was not bad. Not GREAT! but not bad.
2,Something is missing.............,"Was it the bad acting, or a bad script...i think i was both. The cgi andthe sets were good, the gore was pretty good and detailed, but to see theman thing, and other effects, you had to sit through this movie thattried to put you to sleep. Good for a viewing."
3,Pleasantly surprised!,"I think this DVD is definitely worth a rental or purchase. A cut above what is usually found in straight-to-dvd horror films. While the Man-Thing only makes a couple of full frame appearances at the end, the special effects and conceptualization of the creature are worth the wait (especially considering the low budget). The eerie swampy locations are pretty cool, too. Adding to the film's legitimacy is the fact that recent Man-Thing comic writer Hans Rodionoff wrote the script...One character is also named ""Ploog"" a nod to the artist who inked the Man-Thing comic covers in the 1970-80s. The film re-kindled my interest in my old Man-Thing comics."
3,"A good ""B"" movie","This movie reminds me a lot of some of the old ""B"" monster movies of a long-gone era. The acting is bad, the story is weak, people having sex in random places, and there aren't that many thrills. But it you want simple, mindless entertainment with a monster going around killing hillbillies, well then I think you'll enjoy ""Man-Thing."" Getting to actually see Man-Thing at the end is actually pretty cool. Although, this movie does make me look forward to Joel Silver's possible ""Swamp-Thing"" movie. Besides, Marvel can't hit a homerun each time they go up to bat."
1,Don't Waste Your Money.,"My expectations weren't high going into this movie, and I was still disappointed. As a random viewer, the dialogue was absolutely bottom of the barrel, the acting is worthy of the WWE, the Man-Thing doesn't get but a few minutes of screen time, and the plot felt like they took the first idea anyone could come up with. But even with all that, I wasn't going to call it a TERRIBLE movie until the main man and woman decided they were in love for no reason at all. Someone decided plot development wasn't as important as grisly images and bad camera tricks. The fake southern accents and 20 thousand uses of the word yankee will cover that up right? Now, all that's just my reaction as a random viewer. As a Marvel fan, I was down right offended at the lack of adherance to any of the main ideas of the comic book. So no matter who you are, please don't throw away an hour and a half of your life, because you'll never get it back."
2,"Wow, That Should Have Been Better","OKay, let's get to it. The movie is worth watching for only a couple reasons. A few really good corpse scenes and the Man-Thing creature. Now, the really good corpse scenes are scattered throughout the movie, but one has to wait to the end to see the entire Man-Thing. [...]Watch it with the sound off, scan for the good corpse scenes and watch the last 3 minutes. Otherwise, this pathetic script, poor acting, and forced scenes will drive you mad. He, haven't we seen this plot before...like 100 times...corporate pollution + creature (environmentalist) + Alaska, swamp, desert, rainforest location = crap. They could have done so much more with this!"
3,Man Thing as an organic Tickler,"This movie bears little resemblance to the original storys created by Steve Gerber--where Man-Thing looked like his name-was a mindless empath and whoever knew fear burned at his touch!But that's not necessarily a bad thing--though I personally would have preferred a story a little closer to the original.It's a toss up as to which Swamp Creature got better treatment on the big screen--""Man Thing"" or ""Swamp Thing""--though I must admit Man Things costume--despite resembling a giant french tickler is better than the lame rubber suit worn by Swamp Thing.Ths story is actually fairly good-and the swamp scenes are a little creepy--but I miss the humor that was always present in the Gerber storys--though it was a nice touch having Steve named as one of the victims.Worth a watch--just don't expect much of the original story line"
3,A collector's must have!!!,"I'll be honest here, I'm a collector. I bought this DVD to complete the catalog for Marvel films. It's a cool story, and I actually let my 5 year old and 3 year old watch this movie for our father and son bonding night and they were not scared."
3,Marvel Movie Mistake,"This feels like a dirtier version of a SyFy channel movie. It's Marvel Comics answer to Swamp Thing, but mostly just becomes a huge mess."
4,A gift,"I ordered this for my aunt. She said the movie was good, but she didn't like that her favorite actor in the movie gets killed."
2,When a spoof becomes a turkey,"Despite his name and his looks, Günther isn't a sleezy German pimp, but a Swedish dance artist. Of course, Günther & The Sunshine Girls (who look and act like ""lesbian"" porn models) are a spoof.However, I never understood what they are making fun of, and why. MTV video clips? The joke is mostly on Günther. His music is so bad, that it becomes a turkey!You probably have to be really drunk on Swedish hard liquor to appreciate this music (or the spoof). If you live in Sweden: Günther reminds me of Eddie Meduza with a disco beat. But Meduza was at least ""the real thing"". Günther is a purely artificial creation.But then, perhaps he and his ""lesbian"" back up choir can at the very least make ""L Word"" fans go crazy?Two stars...for the effort."
2,You know this a gag right?,"This is a Mad TV, SNL, type of satirical character who is clearly simply someone who is like an Ali G like joker who has hired a crew, or a crew has hired him to make catchy songs about living a sexy life of respect,honor and above all being a man of pleasure. I worked in record store for years,and that was one of the best laughs we ever had about anything,and or an any artist that came ever into our stores. Great gag gift!!!"
2,A big Disappointment,"I bought this for my 5 year old because he liked Ice, Ice Baby. When I saw it had M C Hammer, I thought a two for one had to be a good deal. MC Hammer only has 2 songs #1 and #5 that are his good sounds. Adams Family #2(Whatever) Please! They should have saved the wax used to print it. Vanilla Ice was good, 4 out of 5 is not bad."
5,fun rappers,"I'll give it 5 stars becouse they are two fun rappers.Lets get serious there isnt much rap music thats good, its all just a booty drum hype.Eminem,Outkast,Jay-z,Dr dre and some oldschool rap are the only good rap artists i know of thats cool for real ,all other gangsta rap is only retarded angry people singing to the same drum beat.Please! bring back the old american music spirit!"
3,vanila ice,"when i was young,i was not hip to the club but now at age 25 i think vanilla ice is hot and cool.i havent bought the cd yet,but i hope their rich. if i cuold seell music and be a star.I wish that the eagle would play their hits on the air.thanks for letting me in your fan mail."
5,Durkee,"Wow, Durkee's what else can you say about it, it's Durkee's. I you like a turkey sandwich the day after the big meal there is no other way to go."
5,"Simple, but effective","I really like the design of this push stick. The offset handle is a safety feature, but it also allows me to rip narrow boards with my overhead dust collector in place. I generally hold the push stick in my left hand, but for very narrow rips, I hold it with the tips of my right thumb and fingers, pulling the stock against the fence as I push it though the blade. The fence on my saw is 4"" high. If I am cutting 1/4"" thick stock, the offset part of the push stick just clears the top of my fence. That is, with a 4"" high fence, one can use the push stick to cut material as thin as 1/4"". For higher fences, the minimum stock thickness is accordingly greater, limiting the usefulness of this accessory."
4,Bench Dog Push Stick,"Have made and used several other types of safety push sticks- this one is very good- keeps the fingers far away from the saw blade, as well as providing good positive control of the workpiece. Would suggest this type and brand be included with any new table saw purchases."
4,"Simple, but handy","Nothing much to this push stick and holder, but if you affix it to your saw fence (double-side tape works) then it's always there where you need it. Pencil slot is handy. Space for tape measure is much too small and pointless. Main (and good) thing is the stick keeps your hand up and away from the blade."
2,Nothing Special,This is a mediocre push stick with a docking station that is totally useless. There are other push sticks available that do a much better job.
3,"nice design, wish it was made out of better material","I like the design of this item. I feel like my hand is always out of harms way. The one down side to this item is the type of plastic it is made out of. Its made of a ver hard plastic resin. The kind of plastic that if struck by a spinning blade will shatter. So I don't regret buying it. However, I would say always use caution and be very careful not to contact the blade with this. Not that I think anyone is in there workshop just to touch spinning blades with stuff."
1,Do Not Buy This Toy,"I bought this Barbie Pin Ball Machine for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas 2004 and it was a huge disappointment for both her and I. In order to get the ball in front of the pull nob, you have to pull the nob out for the ball to pop over in front of it. It took my husband to finally get the ball over so our daughter could use it. I do not recommend this toy for anyone as it is poorly made and impossible for a small child to use."
1,A Book By A Pig,"The Pig Scrolls was suppost to be funny. It wasn't . Phrases like ""Oinky Oink Oink"" fill the pages of this book. It is poorly written. It is a weak copy of myths. Eion Colfer said it was so great, on the back of the book. I read his book, Aretmis Fowl. It was an epic bore. Stay away from it too.They can go write there ""great"" books, but I'm staying away from them. I suggest you do, too."
5,Great coming of Third Age tale,"What do you do after your husband of many years dies? Elizabeth (Dench) went to the library twice a week, babysat her granddaughter and that was life enough--til she heard a street busker and took her clandestine saxophone practice to the streets.Her grand-daughter encourages Elizabeth to re-form her old swing band, ""The Blonde Bombshells"" for her school dance. That takes some effort--a couple are dead, one's crazy, one's joined the Salvation Army...But nothing can stop Elizabeth when she's set her mind to something. The resulting story is witty, winning and well worth owning. This film would make a great gift for any woman or man who's entering the third age and looking for some inspiration."
3,If you are into sweet nostalgia,"It has a nice story of a grandmother who played in WW2 in an all-girl band and decides today to get the group back for a schoolchildren concert. She finds opposition from her children but her grand-daughter pushes her on. In parts, I thought the story could have used a little more work still it was reasonable.The acting was good.If you are into these sort of stories it is watchable."
5,soundtrack please,"This is a great movie for anyone who enjoys swing dancing and swing music, both were fantastic in this movie. Why is there no soundtrack available? HBO seems to think there is no market for the soundtracks of a lot of their movies (another great one is Calendar Girls). Watch this on a surround sound system and turn it up !!!"
5,A fun light-hearted tail the whole family can enjoy,"What a wonderful movie this is. It is nice to sit and enjoy a movie that has charm, a great plot and very nice performances by actors and actresses alike. Dame Judi Dench is wonderful as an older lady who wants to reunite with ""The Blonde Bombshells"" a band that played swing during WWII London. Ian Holm is a delight as a rogish gentleman who was the drummer in the band, yes he had to wear a blonde wig and a dress to perform in the band in his younger years.Olympia Dukakis is great to watch as well as the rest of the cast including the fantastic voice of Cleo Laine, who as always is a delight to hear.This is a fun movie to watch and the charm of it all will draw you in. These ""bombshells"" are a blast!Highly Recommended!"
3,Nostalgia,"This is a fairly entertaining HBO film, worthy especially because of Judi Dench, who gives yet another first class performance. But the script is extraordinarily superficial, and its moral overtone is tedious: all that matters in life is to be young and have sex. The Christian in the film is considered a loony. While the Olympia Dukakis character, a many times married drunk, is just a heck of a lot of fun. And so on. The flashbacks to the 1940s are not at all persuasive, especially the makeup. And the sound that tiny band produces is made in fact by a much larger group. The actors do pretty well at pretending to be musicians, with the notable exception of Leslie Caron. Cleo Laine's presence in the film is gratuitous, and the camera should have avoided closeups. In short, here is a happy, silly, predictable, narcissistic flick worthy of HBO. Still, Judi Dench is something to behold."
4,Great stars.,"Great stars, standard story. I enjoy watching these actors perform in any venue and any story. They are all superb at their craft."
4,love the ladies! and the lad!,"fun movie, enjoyed the theme. Always wonderful to see this group act! Go ahead and buy it, then share it with your friends!"
4,Delightful entertainment,"With a cast like the one in this film, my expectations were high, and I was not disappointed. Somehow, I had missed the theatrical release of this film, but I am glad I finally got to see it on DVD. The plot is hardly original: A group of old-time entertainers get together for one last blow-out. There are ups and down along the way, but the cast pulls off the somewhat formulaic plot with aplomb, considerable wit, and some surprises. It's well worth watching even if you think you are familiar with the basic story. You may be, but this is a superior rendition of it."
3,Different,"Not exactly what I expected. The actors were great. It does keep you laughing. However, a little off on the theme."
5,"A delightful little film, funny and sweet.","This is the story of a girls swing band during the second world war, and their eventual reunion in the present day. Our lead character is played by the wonderful Judi Dench. It's also a film about getting older and about living through war-time and all the stress and drama then returning to normal life. The acting is marvelous and the music is especially wonderful (I really hope a soundtrack is released) and the writing marvelous. This was, I think, a joint production between HBO and the BBC. It's a charming film and really worth watching."
3,Blonde Bombshells,We got it to watch with my parents and they LOVED it!!!! (they are in their 80's) It was cute.
3,"Judy Dench is the best, movie OK","I bought this movie because Judy Dench was in it and because all of the reviews were high ratings, but I did not enjoy the movie very much. I thought that the movie was just OK and the only reason why I would watch it again is because of Judy Dench, Joan Sims, and Olympia Dukakis, all three great actors. Oh, and the music in this movie was really terrific."
2,Judi Dench in Last of the Blonde Bombshells,"Ithink I became a fan of Dench's when she wss in a british sitcom ""As Times Goes By"" This particular film, is told in a narrative fashion along with inserts from the past when she was young a playing in a band in the 1940's.The bones for a story was there, however, it just didn't work at all for me. It was if a group of people agreed to make a movie without a script and agreed to just wing it. This along with Dench's ""Mrs. Brown"" completely turned me off as to her charm which I always enjoyed. Either she has no taste in selecting scripts or she just doesnt care.Oh yes, I see Oliva Dukacis on the cover on the DVD, I think she probably has a sentence if that as she plays an alcoholic. Say goodnite Blonde Bombhells."
5,Love Judi Dench,"Really fun movie, loved the theme of reviving old times, acting superb, but then one cannot beat Judi Dench. Loved the movie."
4,A delightful film,"A great cast, headed by the wonderful Judi Dench. Nostalgic, yet quite modern as well. Makes you realize that life changes all the while you are alive, and sometimes it's a great adventure."
4,The Last of the Blonde Bombshells,I bought The Last of the Blonde Bombshells because I am a great fan of Judy Dench and Olympia Dukakis. It was entertaining and cute.
3,large speaking caller id,Well it was working real well for awhile and even when I pushed the dial back button. Well the other day I pushed that button and it went in to far and I know I did not push it in that hard. So now I just can't dial out with it. Otherwise I will use it because it is easy to see in the dark.
1,Does not work,I purchased two of these and neither one worked properly. It shows that an AC adapter will power the unit but this did not happen when I tried to do so. Avoid this product.
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!,"Received the unit I purchased from Amazon it was a piece of junk!! Can't read the display and the product doesn't even come with its own power cord. If you need a reliable caller ID box, I would strongly recommend the Fanstel, since this is the unit I ended up purchasing from another retail supplier."
1,"Bad product, no customer service","The Emerson Large Display Caller id product was defective. The number display showed only ""parts"" of the numbers, and the actual display was cut off at the left and unreadable. The vendor via email seemed fine and Maxi-aids agreed to processing a return but I had to provide my own return labelling and postage. I actually didn't know before this that Amazon doesn't cooridnate returns with outside vendors listed on the site, and as a result of my experience on this purchase, will never buy anything that lists a vendor as the purchase agent. It was a complete rip off. I've never had a problem with ""Amazon"" backed purchases, but with this product via this vendor, no refund was ever processed. I lost not only the product cost and shipping, but also return shipping to send the defective item back. Costly. Awful. Don't buy this product. Also, this vendor is not recommended."
1,Seeing is not believing ... if you can see it at all,"The picture of the product makes it looks like it has a nice, bright blue back lit display. I reality, it's not back lit at all. Instead it's the typical dark greenish looking LCD that you can't read unless you're right next to it and viewing it from just the right angle. I've looked around a bit and just can't find a standalone caller ID box with large characters on a back lit display that you can see from across a small room, or even from one end of a sofa to the other. What's so tough making something like that?"
1,Needs better back lighting -- can't read in dim light,"This display has large text but no lighting. Unless you have perfect light and perfect angle, the display is almost impossible to read."
3,Worked as advertised but insufficient,"The unit worked as advertised, but the display wasn't sufficiently readable for my father, who is visually impaired. I would recommend the unit for people who have some problems with their eyesight but not to anyone with serious vision issues."
4,My 92 year old dad loves it,"i've used a few emerson id products over the year. the price is kinda reasonable. sometimes the product doesn't last as long as i think it should, but so far so good with this one. the display is in color and large enough that my 92 year old dad can see it. he's quite happy and if he's happy, i'm happy."
4,Good Game,"To me this game was fun for awhile but then it started to get HARD.I know I know,That's not a reason to quit but to me it is.But still Good Game."
4,a great spongebob game!!!!,this game is sooo fun my cousin brought it to my house and we couldnt stop playing. i love the minniegames even though i played 1. the bad thing is its realy hard to get through the mother jellyfish. and when you buy things you cant do anything with then. the graphics are pretty good. the game is realy long. and really hard. but i just wish they had on other systems like gamecube or gameboy advanced. buy this game and youll play it everyday you will never stop untill you win. its addicting.
2,SpongeBoring,"This game is really boring! Do not get it! It has no point, Get patrick a gift, Whoopdiedooooo! All you do is get Mermaid man and Barnical Boy stuff! Nothing for patrick exept a lousy Autograph!"
4,Fun till the end of the game.,"This game was really fun. Me and my friend rented it one day and played it until 11:00 p.m. It was great for a while and we beat everything except finding the treasure cheast. We searched for hours but never found it. We got tired of looking so we just gave up. Over all, it was a great game that was not too hard to beat. I am a kind of person who likes after a while to beat the games, so this was good. LOL!! ..."
5,yOU MUST GET THIS Game,this game is so cool you must buy it the graphics are cool and the levels Are hard but the best part is that you choose anyone you want
1,This Game Sucks!!,I thought about buying this game. I'm glad that I didn't. My little brother let me borrow his copy of the game. I am glad that I played his copy before buying this piece of trash.It is a shame to rip off little kids like this.There is *~NO~* action at all. All SpongeBob does is jump around. Can we say a captail BOARING!! Don't waste your time or your money on this piece of trash.I love the SpongeBob game for Game Boy Color. I can't wate to try the SpongeBob game for PS2 (Playstation 2) and the GBA (Game Boy Advance). I bought my little brother SpongeBob for Game Boy Color and he let me play it I just LOVE it and I am not a fan of SPongeBob's. I don't watch the show. I will only watch it if my little brother is watching it.I would have given this game zero stars but that is not an option.
3,Nombie45,"My son is a huge spongebob fan and really wanted this game. He really enjoys it, but as it is play station one is has the old school graphics and loads slow from level to level."
1,PAINFULLY BAD,"Within the first few minutes of playing this game I was left saying ""What the hell ?!"" Mind you I can play a game with a stupid premise, but not a game with a stupid premise and crappy gameplay all in one place. If your an experienced gamer this game will only leave you pissed off because of bad gameplay, and poorly explained objectives, which only left me with the urge to punch the penguins that I already wanted to punch after watching Happy Feet. So remember folks if you enjoy fun things avoid this game and if you don't want to lose your soul to the suckage of this piece of garbage."
2,Too hard for kids,"I bought this game for my Son who is 5 and not only a great gamer but a major SpongeBob fan. Anyway, he found the game hard and frustrating. I've tried it myself and can say honestly that there is too much going on in the game. You have to watch not to lose spatulas or else you die, you need to catch jelly fish, you have to beware of pinching snails and air attacks from other sea critters. It's just annoying! But it is still cute!"
4,pretty good,"ok, this may not be the best game at first, but when you start to really play it, Spongebob's funny charecter makes you laugh and the game becomes really fun."
4,good textbook,It is a very good and comprehensive textbook for beginner to intermediate students in colleges and graduate schools of PDE.
2,I agree with the reader from CAL,"The book skip too many steps and most of the time, the equation is presented without explanation...Don't waste money."
4,Great Learning toy for little ones that like to memorize,"This is a wonderful learning toy for my 2 year old that loves to memorize everything he sees. I will help him remember some of the names of the states and where they go, but that it what its all about anyway. Plus it is supposed to be for 3+. The only thing I don't like about the puzzle is that most states are made from several pieces making it a bit harder to remember their shape and size."
2,Multivariate Tests for Time Series Models (Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences),"The book looks at multivariate time series and plots tests of them a bid too short. The variables used are not described well (MFD for example is not explained what it is). Also the cross reference I was looking at ""see table 8.5.1"" turned out to be wrong as it was referred to ""table 8.5.2"". Overall the booklet is usefull but should have been written with more care for the details, as details are the things we are looking at when we consider a work like this."
5,Keb Mo: Sessions @ West 54th,Keb Mo- What else can you say. The next best thing to seeing him Up Close & Personal. Worth 3x the price.
4,Keb is fun to watch,I love Keb's recordings so it is a treat to see a show. I would hate to be in his band. He looks like he enjoys keeping them on edge with where he is going. But it looks to be in fun! Enjoyable band and a guest shot with Dr. John. I would definatly make the effort to see him in live if I get the opportunity. Picture and sound are fine!
4,Great music,"If you like fast industrial sounds kinda techno like, you'd like this CD! It's fun and very energetic!"
5,GREAT!,I think that this movie is great. I think that Vincent Larusso is the cutest. That's all I have to say.
3,A total remake of the first!,"This was the worst Mighty Ducks movie. I can't say you gotta love it because of the Hockey, because there is barly any Hockey in it! It was humorous, but failed to live up to the first two."
1,HORRIBLE!,This Mighty Ducks movie is absoutely horrible and the worst of the series. It doesn't have any hockey in it. The pranks are really bad and the movie itself is so boring. Don't waste your time! Stick with one and two.
3,The Puck Stops Here,"Plot: After there successful Team U.S.A. experience they are all offered scholarships to the incoming freshman class at the esteemed Eden Hall Academy. Not only do the Mighty Ducks now have to prove their worth to a school filled with snotty rich kids, but must face the varsity hockey team waiting to destroy their reputation.`D3: The Mighty Ducks' released in '96 is a case of going to the pond, I mean well, once to often. It's not neccessarily a bad movie, it's simply a case of nothing new to offer after the first two movies. The on and off the ice antics are old and tired and the youthful energy of the cast is definitely running on empty. It's time to hang up that jersey and move on."
3,it's a good family movie,"got if for a christmas present, to go along with D1 and D2, enjoyable for young children. I recommend disney"
4,a good finale to the series,a good finale to the series. funny yet fun like all the other films. good hockey filming and a good story.
5,LOVE EMILIO ESTEVEZ!,"THIS MOVIE IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TWO - EMILIO ESTEVEZ IS EXCELLENT AND THE KIDS PLAYING THE ""MIGHTY DUCKS"" ARE VERY GOOD AS WELL. IT KEEPS YOUR ATTENTION AND IS FUN AND VERY ENTERTAINING."
3,"Whipped - has some good moments, if you like gross humor","This movie is not a clever movie about dim people a la ""Something About Mary."" This is not even a dim movie about dim people. It is a bad movie made by somebody who ought to know better.It does have some funny moments - although it will only appeal to those who like crass humor such as myself. The key point of the movie is that three complete losers fall in love with the same woman and she plays games with them.The funny moments come when the three would be Lotharios detail their strategies for bedding women and when their married friend tries to intervene. Also contains disgusting sexual humor concerning analingus, toilets and group sex.This movie will thrill a select audience - you know who you are - but otherwise, go watch something else."
3,Trip out film,got this film on late night&it was so basic but yet I couldn't help but trip.this Film is everything that Sex in the city isn't to me on a whole.this is the kind of film you are gonna knock it but still find a way to Peep it all the way.
4,All round top film,I saw this one at the cinema and was so impressed I had to own the dvd. It's a great movie with lots of smart dialogue... and there is nothing I enjoy more than a movie with smart dialogue! It stars the very saucy Amanda Peet who you would know from Saving Silverman and The Whole Nine Yards. All in all a great movie with many quotables... the only negative thing I can say about this film is that it didn't have the best of endings... but it certainly didn't spoil this fine film.
4,Hilarious,"This one come as a very nice surprise. While it is extremely lewd and crude, it is also bitingly funny. The only negatives are the length of the movie (it's too short at an hour and 15 minutes), and the special features are nearly non existent. Still, I wholly recommend it."
1,What a brutal film,"Possibly the worst movie ever made. I don't think I've seen anything this bad since I saw a body pulled out the river when I was 10.If you happened to like this movie, you are .... The critics were right on this one. Yuck!"
1,vomitous,"pathetic and sad. terrible production value. not even so bad it's good, like a showgirls. just plain... painful. please don't watch it. i beseech you."
1,One of the Worst Movies Ever Made,"If I ever make a list of the worst movies I've seen in my life, Whipped will certainly be in the top (bottom?) five. Amanda Peet must have been in desperate need of money to agree to participate in this annoying, idiotic and witless movie.The only thing worse than the screenplay are the male actors. Granted, they are not given much to play with, since their characters are such stereotypes they might as well be cardboard cutouts (the geek, the player, the boring married guy) but still, I have rarely seen such terrible and unappealing performances on the screen.As for writer-director Jonathan Abrahams, what can I say? If this guy managed studio executives to finance and distribute this movie, he could probably sell snow to Alaskans. Abrahams should be in sales, not in movies."
1,Like having an electric drill run through your skull.,"The fact that this movie has received a positive response here is disturbing. It is painfully, migraine-inducingly bad. It contains the intelligence of a toaster, and the creativity of a pile of shoes. Anyone who claims it to be a 'realistic' or 'satirical' portrait of anything resembling real life has, like this movie, no actual connection to the real world. This insipid piece of swill is alternately crude, nauseating, boring, humorless, and highly, thoroughly unoriginal. For your own safety, please stay away."
1,Cat in the Hat Bow Tie - Junk!!!!,"This product is nothing but junk - I would have returned it, but after postage cost and the venders restocking fee - I would owe more money. Don't buy this product!"
4,"Melodious, seductive, and etheral","Belden's tribute to Elizabeth Short (The Black Dahlia), an aspiring actress who was brutally murdered in the late 1940s, is an amazingly-crafted work that also mirrors the dreamlike music of Chinatown and other film noir pieces. A soundtrack without a movie, Black Dahlia instills a mythical and fantastic world around Short's difficult and lovelorn life, creating moods and atmospheres with some of jazz's top talent."
3,Nice noir but tough on speakers.,"This is a fine effort with lovely, complex, film noir flavor. Its a big production, with orchestra reminding me of Claus Ogerman. Caution: This recording has immense dynamic range--so if you listen to it in an apartment or a car, beware. There are portions that are almost inaudible followed by crescendos that could break safety glass. Now that you've been braced, enjoy."
5,Jewel,"Item was new in excellent condition, delivery was slow. The DVDs are made from an analog television program so the quality is not at HD standard, but still it is easily watchable."
5,Oldie but Goodie,"I hadn't seen this series since it originally came out. It was better than I remembered, and despite its age, it hasn't aged at all. The series gives a great glimpse at English imperialism and attitudes of the day, as well as insight into the troubles between India and Pakistan that started at that time. This is a series that will hold your interest from beginning to end and is well worth the time to watch it."
5,I enjoyed this DVD very much,I enjoyed this movie when I first saw it on TV and I still enjoyed it on DVD.Outstanding movie. Worth the cost.
1,Excellent series - Appalling digital transfer,"Heed Spoffo's warning.While the series itself is wonderful and certainly worth owning, I have NEVER seen a worse DVD transfer. Even my seedy Madacy Entertainment copy of Fritz Lang's 1226 ""Metropolis"" is of higher quality. The visuals are fuzzy and grainy at the same time, and there are severe block artifacts everytime the screen gets even slightly dark. All scenes shot at night or in the darkness are almost unwatchable because of the visual noise.The sound seemed alright to me at first, but then I turned the volume up a bit and found that there is a kind of low-pitch static, like machine noise underneath the vocals and music.Please buy the VHS tapes - and let A&E; know that this is simply unacceptable!"
3,"Fantastic series, over-the-top acting, wretched transfer","I loved watching this series. The cast was terrific (Tim Pigott-Smith is as snake-like as the cobra he kills in the bathtub), the locales stunning, and the story compelling. However, the acting was occasionally far too melodramatic, something I don't expect from British actors, and the editing was substandard in places. The DVD transfer was the most wretched I'd ever seen and the sound quality was awful. Whoever handled the transfer has every reason to be ashamed. Do not let any of this stop you. It's one of the best TV mini-series ever made and is thoroughly engrossing to watch."
4,I just was waiting for it,"Back in 1982 I bought in Abu Dhabi the Jewel in the Crown in 12 VHS and I am happy I have seen it in only 4 DVDS at Amazon. The quality of the reproduction, so far, (who can see 4 x 3hrs each DVD in such a short time) is excellent and it is a pleasure hearing a good english speaking after so many american slang movies we see everyday at TV. Thanks.Mauro"
1,"Great story, defective set",I wonder if anyone else's copy was defective. Disk 4 was a duplicate of Disk 3. Couldn't even watch the end of the series.
3,Not so much..,"It is another one of those you either watched and loved or turned off. I thought since she enjoyed the Far Pavilions she would enjoy this historical mini-series as well. The low quality of the DVDs was not the real trouble with the series for us. We just didn't identify with the cast. If you loved it before you love it again DVD, low quality or not."
3,Jewel in the Crown DVD,"Hello:I was very dissapointed that this set of DVDs did not contain closed captioning! In this day and age it seems ridiculous not to have included closed captioning!I am keeping the set, but wanted to register my displeasure at A and E for not having the foresight to include closed captioning!James Keithfultonsheen@yahoo.com"
4,"Fascinating, complex story","I knew the Jewel in the Crown was about India, but somehow I always assumed it was 19th century India, not WWII. So this was a complete surprise to me. I also had no idea how dark this series was, so I was shocked as worse and worse things kept happening to the characters. Nonetheless, I couldn't stop watching because I had to know what was going to happen next. The story is very complex, and the ending not as satisfying as I would have liked, but now that it's over I can't stop thinking about it. As painful as some parts were, it was very worthwhile and really made me think. I don't know much about the DVD quality as some people mentioned, but it would have been nice to have some commentary or bonus features."
1,Where are the subtitles?,"I'll echo the sentiments expressed by others regarding the digital transfer of this series. The actors and viewers deserved better. Another issue is the lack of subtitles. Considering the numerous British accents used not to mention the Hindi language, subtitles would have been very helpful. Five stars for the miniseries and one star for the DVD set."
3,Excellent Series; Awful DVD,"This DVD edition ruins all of the magic of the original. Poor copy, hideous transfer, incredibly bad sound trandfer - the voices are bland, dull, it's a miserable. How not to do a DVD"
5,Best of the best in British period drama,"superb. Acting is wonderful and the entire series in a classic that will never date and gets you involved from the start. Gripping, has pathos etc."
5,better the second time,Missed parts of several episodes when originally broadcast. Glad I watched all episodes. Was my first experience using Amazon Instant Video through my Sony Wi-Fi Blue-ray player. Excellent. Now if Amazon and Samsung can work out their competitiveness so that I can enjoy Amazon Instant Video through my Samsung smart Wi-Fi Blu-ray player and larger HDTV.Why do I need Amazon Prime if I can only use it in one room.
4,"Life, as Seen Through the Luxury of Embroidered Silk or from a Muddy Ditch Alongside the Road.","I would have been happy to sit and just watch the scenery. The visuals where able to tell the story (almost) even without the verbiage. The words alone could have set the mind's eye into the vast images of exotic places. What a wonderful excursion into the beauty, the horrors, the love and the hate of an entire Country, masses of populace and the small, intimate group of Brits that the story weaves together into a stunning bolt of irridescent Indian Sari silk dragged through the mud and blood of political upheavel.All that and Louis Vuitton Luggage... Who could want more?"
4,A truly great series,"This DVD has some problems with the soundtrack, with some of the softer conversation muffled.Still it is the same engrossing, intriguing story we saw on television when it was a new release. I experienced the same involvement with these superbly drawn characters and story line, defined against the background of the end of the Raj.The DVD is not flawless--there a few editing bobbles--but it is a necessity for any refined collection of dramatized novels, British literature, Raj literature, or tours-de-force of acting.I found the performances of Peggy Ashcroft, Judy Parfitt, and Art Malik as enthralling as they were years ago."
4,adjust your sets,"Great great story and presentation. For those of you unhappy with the picture quality you have to adjust your sets...contrast, color saturation, sharpness etc etc. and the picture is very watchable.I don't know why A&E; didn't update the picture quality so you don't have to adjust your set...especially with their ballhoed ANNIVERSARY edition. The earlier DVD and this current version are the same...just repackaged.I had the Videos but have forgotten how they looked."
5,A superbly acted series that will grip you from the start,"I rewatch this marvelous series every couple years and am amazed how caught up I get in it each time. Such deep, three-dimensional performances! Well written, well performed -- a sure bet!"
5,Great,"Some of his best writing, I think because it is a very earnest look back at a life. Very poignant and powerful read for me, since I grew up in Portage, MI and have many good family memories of many of the other Michigan haunts written about in this memoir."
4,The Great Fitzgerald,"WHile it did not enjoy the acclaim of it's prodeccesor, The Great Gatsy, Fitzgerald succeds once more in capturing the melancholy, self-disapassionated apathy of post-world war one america. WHile the the tangled lives of the DIvers are in themselves intersting enough to drive the story, it is Fitzgerald's astounding capacity to capture human interactions that makes it wonderful."
3,Not a great follow-up to reading Gatsby,"My high school English teacher had a big thing for Lost Generation writers, and while I've taken on her love for Hemingway, I may need to read another Fitzgerald to get back into the Lost Generation as a whole. Tender is the Night was not what I expected. It took too long to get into, dragging the reader with one character and then dropping her half way through the novel to pursue the flashbacks about the main couple. I was totally bored with it. I give it three stars because I can respect the beauty of FS Fizgerald's prose, but the story just didn't grab me."
4,More personal than The Great Gatsby,"Tender Is the Night is the story of a very dysfunctional American couple, the Divers, slowly disintegrating in Europe. Much less economical and symbolic than The Great Gatsby, it is a personal work. There are some problems with this novel, such as the coincidental way in which characters meet each other again across Europe and the poor development of some of the important secondary characters. However, one is convincingly drawn in to the initial magic of the Divers' relationship and its gradual collapse."
4,This book was SOOOO good!!!,"I liked F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing because of its metaphors and imagery that enable the reader to get a real sense of what is happening to the characters. The characters that he creates are also fascinating. However, I found parts of the storyline to be confusing. The book jumps around in time which was also a little confusing. On a scale of A to F, I would give this book an A-. It is a really great book and I strongly recommend it."
3,Cover not the same as image,"I only bought this book for its cover. I needed it for a craft I was working on and I paid more for shipping than the book, so Im not totally disapointed. However, I am disapointed that the image of the book is not what the book actually looks like since that was the only reason I purchased the book. If I knew what it looked like I would not have gotten it. The book was in good condition and if I were to read it was well worth it. It was just not right for my craft."
3,I'm ambivalent,"If you like style and storyline, this is a pretty good book to read. If you like likeable or interesting characters and an absence of misogyny, this is not a very good book to read."
3,"No ""Gatsby""","Fitzgerald's writing style is brilliant in places here, and I found it fascinating to see how he built up some of the novel's themes -- especially that of wealthy American tourists invading war-scarred Europe. At one point, he writes something about a nation (the U.S.) that had spent the last ten years (1918-1928) wanting nothing more than amusement: Just wait a few decades! But I didn't have much sympathy for Dr. Diver, who I felt was ruined more by his own self-pity than by his marriage. And therefore, I didn't find much point in reading about his downward spiral."
3,"Book: ""Tender is the Night""","Book: ""Tender is the Night"" I believe I chose the book for two reasons. (1) My mother was a Fitzgerald who grew up in Ireland, around the corner on Mary Steet from the castle of the Knight of Glin. (The current knight and his family still live there. My mother was not related to him nor his forbearers.) Unfortunately, I disliked the book. It did not hold my attention, probasbly because it depicts a life style that, to me, made borely reading. (2) As a child in the era of F.Scott Fitzgerald, and therefor a mere onlooker of the ""exciting"" lives of adults, I have grown in what I view a ""tamer"" time."
3,Not so tender,I had never read this before but did so recently with high hopes. I was disappointed. I found it mawkish and mannered. The Great Gatsby makes for a better read.
3,"Nice wrapping, but....","Beautifully packaged and designed -- one in a series of Fitzgerald books covered by Coralie Bickford-Smith -- but the print is oddly misshapen and faint at times, as if it were photocopied, and this has one of the worst introductions to Fitzgerald's work I've ever read, by Arnold Goldman. His notes aren't any good either. I was thinking about picking up all the books in this series, but until I can determine if the rest of the introductions are as bad (which I can't do on Amazon) I'm going to hold off."
2,Working Class,Had not read F S Fitzgerald previously and was expecting a better read. The character development was great but found the story line lacking and the whole of it bland in the end.
3,Moving yet Opaque,"Mr. Fitzgerald, excuse me for this brief criticism of your masterwork, ""Tender is the Night."" To begin, TITN is a articulate, beautifully detailed work. Fitzgerald brilliantly mantains a languid, imagery and motif-filled text. Dick Diver, Rosemary and Nicole are each real people, in stunning contrast to the superficial emotions and problems of Gatsby, Nick and Daisy. Overall, the book is captivating, the characters intoxicating. Yet it was the poor flow of the book that annoyed me. Gaps in time, unartful character and plot development, and inconsistancy in chapter breaks led me to be shocked at his lack of care for what could have been his most amazing piece. Pehaps the themes struck too close to home or its magnitude became too intense for F. Scott Key. Regardless, this book makes for a great vacation read as it is one infinitely more complex and deep than ""Gatsby""."
4,Tender Is the Night,"I had to read this book in high school. It was a nice change to be able to read something by Fiztgerald because I had to read Macbeth and Twelfth Night which I thought was extremly boring. The characters in Tender Is the Night were real and the story line wasn't like all the rest. It seemed like Dick only married Nichole because she was mentaly disable and he thought his love would ""cure"" her. And she married him because she felt comfortable and loved, but that's because he was all she knew for so long. Reading this was quite difficult because it would skip from one scene to another. Dick Diver would have flashbacks of when him and Nichole were together, then when he first met Rosemary. It was all jummbled together so I didn't know when it was the past or present. It didn't end the way I thought it was going to, but I guess that's what made it so intresting. I would probably suggest to all readers to read it twice to get a good understanding of it."
5,Intriguing and illuminating,"This book is full of paradoxes that make you wonder who exactly could invent such a theme. FitzGerald is the answer. He has a capacity like very few others to captivate an audience who may not completely understand his point of view or motive. Nicloe's illness gives an interesting twist to the plot which otherwisse would be a boring story of romance, deception, and of course society. This is a great work of Fitzgerald's but should not be the first book one reads by him."
3,"Uhhh, very interesting book.","Tender is the Night is THE most confusing book I have ever read. It was required reading for gifted students over the summer. I recommend that if you do read this book, read section 2 first, then 1 and 3. The book goes to a flashback in section 2. This is where it is so confusing. The content was okay, if you like the love and phsycho mix."
3,Second-Rate Fitzgerald,"Though valuable to those interested in Fitzgerald, or to those who would find the historical and cultural aspects of the book interesting (the decadence of US ex-pat society life in 1920's southern Europe), compared to The Great Gatsby, Tender is the Night was disappointing. Though the prose and literary style for which Fitzgerald is known is evident (and admittedly enjoyable), the book's plot is disappointingly weak and as shallowly developed as the lives of its protagonists. Though some might argue this is intentional, for one who's looking for a read to provide them with more mind-churning fodder on which to feast, this would not be the book in which to find it."
2,pretty disjointed,"Notwithstanding the outstanding quality of Fitzgerald's other novels, this one is definitely not a must read. The plot drags along wearily at places, settings and places are not always well captured (Fitzgerald's sketch of the Riviera life does not really convince me), characters are weakly drawn, undecisive, some caricatures. The life of the main protagonists of the story does not offer enough interest in order to keep the reader interested in them for such a long novel. Except maybe you are specifically interested in psychiatrist maladies. It is neither a tragedy nor a humorous book nor just a tantalizing story, but an unsuccessful mixture of all three. Read The Great Gatsby to get the best of Fitzgerald. The book spent three years on my shelf after being bought and having read the first 30 something pages, and justly so."
2,Shockingly Bad,"I am not a big fan of F.Scott Fitzgerald's, but I do believe he had genuine talent. Unfortunately, Fitzgerald's talent is sorely lacking in this novel, Tender is the Night. The characters are neither attractive or entirely believeable, and the jerky transitions from scenes and time frames are exhausting to follow. I regret to agree 100% with Hemmingway's scathing review of this novel. Fitzgerald fans should check out the movie version of Tender is the Night starring Jennifer Jones and Jason Robards to appreciate what Fitzgerald may have been aiming for in his novel of love and the unintentioned consequences of a mismatched couple."
4,Tender is the Night,"The book was in okay condition -- but the spine of the book was very dry and as I read it the book literally fell apart. The book itself was very good. The plot was compelling, the characters detailed and the readability excellent.I could see the influence of filmmaking on Fitzgerald."
2,I love books and this one is just bad...,"Boring, outdated ex-patriate story of life in Paris between the wars, focusing on a young American actress, a psychologist Dr. Diver and his wife, an American baroness with issues. Lots of drinking and gossip."
1,His Painful Attempt to Justify Way He Treated Zelda,"Fitzgerald's most aggravatingly uneven novel is thinly disguised justification for the way he treated Zelda, the novelist's beautiful and multi-talented wife.In reality, Scott had her committed to a mental hospital where she was effectively beaten down into a very lifeless and sorry state, her glow and drive vanished. Tender is the Night paints a creepily pretty picture of a handsome, brilliant, young psychiatrist two-timing on his beautiful and flawed heiress wife.It's just a rough read when you know what really happened between the two.I regret my time spent on it."
1,A big fat flop,"It's an utter failure. Because it's a character study without the slightest trace of characterological depth. Dick & Nicole remain dead on the page all the way thru. And please don't give me any crap about how Dick & Nicole were ""deliberately written as ciphers in order to reveal their emptiness"" because I'm not buying it. I certainly don't think that it was Fitzgerald's intention to render them as ciphers. But that's about the extent of his accomplishment here."
1,This is no classic,I had been reading Hemingway and thought I might as well read Fitzgerald. Oh dear. What a waste of time. I read 3/4 of the book and threw it in the dump. I fully agree with another reviewer. Fitzgerald on one book in him...and this was not it!
3,Taken aback.,"I was excited to start this book at first. The story started off somewhat slow. Not till I started the middle of the book then it started to get exciting. The ending did not turn out how I expected. Overall, I felt depressed after reading this story."
3,Sporadically touching. Overall dated and disappointing,"Fitzgerald wrote a perfect short novel in Gatsby. I find the more ambitious and longer Tender is the Night disappointing. It is too loose, occasionally rambling, and the overly artful language now seems dated. The storyline is simple- the progress of a marriage from infatuation to its end, and the collapse of the main character. But the book only comes to life in the final fifty pages. Unlike his contemporaries, Proust, Hemingway, Miller etc, Fitzgerald now seems antique. Instead, I would recommend Fiesta- The Sun ALso Rises, or, if the reader has a couple of years on his hands, Remembrances of Times Past. Both cover the essential theme far better."
3,"Fitzgerald's weakest novel, but a good read....","Through the narrative, it's clear that Fitzgerald cannot choose which character to develop, and in the end, none is explored satisfactorily. As a panorama of failed marriage, ""Tender"" lacks the strength of ""The Beautiful and Damned"", which I consider to be similar and superior, though less popular.But still, F. Scott Fitzgerald is F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the writing is wondrous, but this is not his quintessential book.If the absurdist movement is regaining steam in American culture, this explains the resurgence of popularity in this novel, which though strong in the first third, turns out as an unsatisfying mess."
4,"A Good Story, but nothing extraordinary.","Tender is the Night is a very well written and engaging novel. However, it is a far cry from some of Fitzgerald's other works. By no means did it impart the dramatic and profound portrayals of The Great Gatsby, yet it did create a certain amount of sympathy for its leading characters and the lifestyle as a whole. Again, Fitzgerald does what he does best in portraying the lifestyles of the upper-class during the 1920's.I would recommend this book for those interested in the culture of the 1920's and for mere entertainment's sake, but it is not as profound a novel as it could have been."
2,A wrong choice,"Tender is the Night is a novel of bourgeoise boredom. The book has a very promising premise - what would happen if a young psychiatrist was to marry his rich and beautiful but unstable patient? Big fat conflict, just like the size of the book might suggest? No dice - an occasional glimpse of genious sinks in a routine and boring ramblings about the characters' life in high society. I was really dissapointed. So I advise everybody to start with the Great Gatsby, I hear it's much better and I know now that Tender is the Night is a bad book."
2,I thought I would love this book,"based on what I had read about it, but I did not. There were parts that I liked, passages that are well-written, but overall the writing is stilted and the narrative choppy. There is an air of self-importance in the narrative itself that rivals that of the characters, which has the effect of downplaying their snobbery. There are also a few instances in Book 1 where Fitzgerald felt the need to tell the reader about, even though he had already shown, Rosemary's naivete. I also agree with the reviewers who said that Fitzgerald failed in presenting the psychology of Nicole's illness accurately."
1,Hard read!,I couldn't get into this book. It was a very hard read and I never finished it. We picked it for our book club and no one finished it!
3,Hmm...,"I was interested in this CD because I had heard a few of Varese's more popular works (Ionisation, Integrales), liked them and was interested in what else this composer had to offer. Well, this CD is basically more of the same, only of lesser quality. If you have not heard Varese's music before, most of it involves forlorn sounding melodies with equally forlorn accompaniment (lots of tritones) mixed together with percussion. Considering his output fills less than two CDs, you would expect it to be a lot more varied and interesting. I suppose Varese may have been a 20th century pioneer (use of timbre, etc) but his music is not all that appealing to me. There are much better 20th century composers, I think."
3,It's OK...,"I can see that Frank Zappa would have been inspired by this music. As a longtime Zappa fan, I can hear plenty in Zappa's music that was modeled after Varese. Still, Varese's pieces on this CD are hardly monumental or awe-inspiring, and this seems to be the kind of music that very much depends on how it's played and interpreted. You don't get much better than Pierre Boulez; if it was, for example, me conducting an ensemble in performing Varese's work, nobody would listen. So it seems that it's not as much the music as the performance. And that Varese cannot be credited with."
2,Weak Effort From the Egyptian Diva,"I have only had limited exposure to Natacha Atlas's unique and wonderful music, but I know a weak effort when I hear it. This is one. Even her slinky, Old World charms cannot totally save this disc. While Mish Fadilak, Rah, and Lelsama are strong tracks, most of the rest of the disc suffers from weak grooves and uninspired arrangements. And her take on I Put A Spell On You may have been an interesting idea, but on disc it just doesn't work; her voice is not suited to blues/rock and I actually laughed when I heard it.But don't let this review get anyone down. I fully respect and love past work that I have heard. For the uninitiated, I would suggest Gedida or Diaspora as a starting point. Natacha Atlas is wonderfully talented, but Ayeshteni is not a good example of this."
2,The worst CD by Natacha Atlas,"I own three CDs by Natacha Atlas. Gedida and Halim are both pretty good, and I would recommend it. Ayeshteni is poorly made and I do not recommend it. I have not yet listened to her fourth CD, but I still vote ""Ayeshtani"" the worst of all four."
2,Very disappointing,"The best song on this CD is the one that's available for free as an Amazon download. Its ""Mish Fadilak"". For a very pricey CD this was not very good."
2,Unlistenable. Please skip this album; nothing to see here.,"I am so grateful that this was not the first Natacha Atlas album I ever heard, because I would never have gone on to discover the wonders of her other works. This is absolute garbage. If you want gorgeous music expressive of Middle Eastern traditional music, Ana Hina is a wealth of wonders. If you want dance music, Diaspora is full of infectious grooves and surprises. This album takes boredom to a new level."
3,can not recommend,Selections are extremely short - like a collection of critical passages across Durkheim's works. Given the price can not recommend.
5,Always Another Adventure,"This is the earliest and most complete biographical story of one of the very best and most well-known underwater archeologists to don underwater gear. From the earliest days when this was just becoming interesting as a sport, adventure, hobby, or historical pursuit, Marx weaves an amazing description of his entry to this activity from his days in the Marine Corps, through countless discoveries of both famous and unknown sunken ships over the years to the present. His contribution to underwater archeology is immeasureable; we are the benefactors.Since the original is out of print, it took me some time to locate a good used copy (an excellent copy of which I was able to purchase through Amazon.com) ; the search is well worth the effort. This is a book I will prize in my library!P.S. You will find his adventures in the Yucatan peninsula truly facinating, since it dates from the ""PRE-CANCUN"" era. (I.m ready to head-on back right now!)"
2,Hard to assemble,I never got to wear this because it was so hard to assemble especially if your by yourself with a 7 month belly. I tried to have my husband assist but we both got so frustrated with it. I would suggest just buying a band that goes under your belly and does not have 3 or 4 different parts to apply around your belly.
3,Great support! Impossible to hide under clothes!,"The belt works great! I use it for jogging, and my belly doesn't bounce at all! However... the back of the box says ""Doesn't show under clothing"" Which is a blatant lie! It is impossible to hide this thing! Its enormous! You could hide it under a baggy sweatshirt, but that is about it!I highly recommend this for the support, but if you expect to hide it... I wouldn't count on it!"
4,works well but...,This belly belt does work but the only problem I had with it is when I fasten it under my belly it puts more pressure on my bladder and that's the last thing I needed. 4 out of 5 stars from me.....I can only handle wearing this for short periods at a time.
2,Didn't provide well,"My baby was sitting low giving me extra stomach pain. The doctor suggested I try a maternity belt. After reading several reviews on different products, I chose this at $35. I wish I didn't spend the money. It just didn't provide the relief I was looking for or that others experienced. I was also afraid to pull it tighter for fear of taking too much of the baby's room. I had my doctor look at it and she said I seem to be wearing it correctly but it wasn't providing what I needed."
4,I found the book very interesting,"Michael Schermer, an atheist and skeptic, tries to sincerely understand those who believe in God. He provides some really good information on why people believe. Polls taken show that men in general try to justify their beliefs in myths through rational means while women tend to focus on the emotional. Though the analysis was for the most part factual, I could certainly see why women might be offended.The most interesting aspect of the book to me was the evidence regarding men believers. Confronted with evidence that shoots them down, men true believers of all myths have resorted to amazing mental gymnastics to believe what they believe. In this regard I found the book remarkable and useful. Though it seeks to understand believers, in the end it exposes them as the weak, superstitious, intellectual panty-wastes they are."
5,just read it,"By the time I am writing this review there are already several posted by others. The mixed results cause this book to have only a 3&1/2 star rating. ""HOW WE BELIEVE"" gives us a deeper understanding on religion by using other subjects as science, history, psychology & anthropology with a healthy skepticism to explain belief. A couple of interesting moments toward the beginning of the book are Shermer's conversion to Christianity & the problems he encountered afterward & Dr. Laura's issues with the Skeptics Society. I am writing a brief review and giving it 5 stars hoping that other admirers of Shermer's books who have not written a review will post theirs. Shermer deserves more than a 3&1/2 star rating."
5,Shermer did it again,"Michael Shermer is awesome, thats pretty much all there is too it.The book is jam packed full of interesting facts about... well... how we believe. Shermer nicely outlines why religious and magical thinking was helpful from an evolutionary perspective. Besides at looking at things such as scientific and philosophical arguments for and against Gods existance, ""intelligent design"" and the ""bible code"", Shermer delves into all sorts of things to show how belief and experiencing God points to nothing outside of our own brains.This is the untimate God book."
1,Nothing New...,"For someone who keeps abreast of all the Science/spirituality literature, this book was a synthesis of other people's words and works, and in itself neither says nor offers anything new..."
1,Discredited ideas,"In yet another tome that proves the intellectual bankruptcy of contemporary atheism, Shermer sets out to prove that all religions are psychological phenomena that ultimately teach the same things. He identifies common themes - like the apocalypse - in all religions, and equates these themes with psychological experiences.Wrong. Religion is not equivalent. Three interrelated faiths - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - all deny each other's central doctrines. When we move out from the West, we see such diversity of religious beliefs that no common theme emerges.Religious experience ranges from animism (where you can be healed of your ailments by absorbing the soul of a bird) to certain types of Buddhism that don't even believe in a god. The idea of a common ""religion"" is simply false - especially when you realize that Atheistic philosophies like Communism and Nazism are fully-functional religions in their own right.Shermer's warmed-over Jungian approach is 100 years out of date."
4,Brilliantly orchestrated social analysis,"This brilliantly orchestrated journey into the depths of human emotion and science are a joy for the beleiver and the skeptic. Dr. Shermer examines every facet of the sociological and psychological impact of people and their belief systems. To the keen reader, this book asks hard-hitting and provocative questions as to the nature and depths of those ideals we hold to be truth. While at the same time dissecting pseudo-sciences and archaic models for belief and rationality for what they truly have become: Dying paradigms in a critical thinkers world!! Books such as this have special places in the hearts of those who hold truth to be the ultimate goal of scientists, secularists and religious scholars. A can't miss piece of philosophical examination into the mind of the human animal, and a joy from beginning to end!!"
2,"The Edwin Hopkins translation of Gorky's ""The Lower Depths""","This is a warning. This is an atrocious translation and should be avoided. Hopkins, who translated this work in 1906 is either sloppy or just a poor translator. The English is awkward, and what is most reprehensible, Hopkins just plain omits two of the most important factual items of the entire play--1) Gone is Pepel's admission that he spend time in prison because he murdered a man, and 2) and this is the most grievous of all, the fact that Actor hanged himself at the play's cnclusion (almost the last words of the play which produces an immense impoact) is also omitted. There is no good reason other than monetary since all copywrite is probably gone for this edition, to republish it. I learned this the hard way, using it in a class amd now have subjected my students to this particular translation. It is a wonderful play, but this edition should be taken off the market."
4,"Very Interesting, Very Detailed",I think the book is better than the other review gave it credit for. I will agree that he does go out of his way to discredit Grant's drinking. But on the whole these are pretty informative books not as dry as the other review says they are. The two new editions by the University of Nebraska Press have great introductions by Grimsley and Simpson. Simpson gives more credit to Williams than the review here gives. These introductions are excellent. But the volumes are not always about Grant. The Kentucky Invasion is covered in the second volume as is the battle of Murfreesboro. I recommend these books to anyone interested in Grant and/or the Western Theater of the Civil War.
5,Captures the times beautifully,"""Longtime Companion"", the first full-length chronicle of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s, remains as fresh a look today as when it was made in 1990. Beginning with the discovery of a ""gay cancer"" in 1981, the film follows a group of loosely-knit friends on a year-to-year basis throughout the decade, and does so with empathy and humor. There are many fine performances, including a moving one by a young Campbell Scott.""Longtime Companion"" seeks to reflect but also to educate, reminding viewers that the deaths of these friends held meaning not only for their intimates but for the larger community as well. AIDS may not make the headlines it once did, but it still warrants a good deal of medical attention through research and human consideration for those who have the disease. It would be fascinating if an updated ""Longtime Companion"" could ever be made."
2,What a disappointment,"I really wanted to love this movie, but it is badly written and acted. I am sure it was good for the world to open their eyes, but couldn't we have done it with a good movie?"
2,The feel bad movie of the century,"Don't watch this movie if you're in a good mood because it will drag you right down into the depression that exists in this movie. It starts out great. People are happy, making jokes, enjoying life. Then all the sudden a guy gets AIDS. Then another guy gets AIDS. Then another and so on. They all die. Pretty much the entire cast dies. I could understand this if the movie was like ""Queer As Folk"" and had guys going to bars and taking home different men nightly. But these guys seemed intelligent, responsible men and you never see any of them sleeping around. So how do they get AIDS??? At a certain point in the movie you're just asking yourself ""Ok, who is gonna die next?"" I'd give this movie 1 star if it wasn't for the fine acting the cast gives out even though they didn't have much to work with."
5,Nice,"I grew up with this book- it's children's fiction at its best- witty and readable at the ripe old age of 23. Adults may even enjoy it more than kids, but it presents an even-handed and sympathetic portrait of ""the little world""- the Po valley in Italy. It's unfortunate that it's not read more often. i'm told that Guareschi was very well loved by a generation of European children, regardless of nationality. If in doubt, just get it!"
4,Classic Barbara Stanwyck western suitable for family viewing,"The Maverick Queen is a classic Barbara Stanwyck western suitable for family viewing. The plot is straight forward with just enough surprises to keep your interest. Stanwyck's character, the Maverick Queen, is similar to her role as Victoria Barkley in The Big Valley--a strong woman in a man's world. One of the best things about the movie is the spectacular scenery. The Maverick Queen was shot on location in and around Silverton, Colorado. It utilizes excellent footage of a real life slice of history, which is still much the same today. Hollywood staging cannot compare to the real location shots available in Silverton. I highly recommend viewing this classic western filmed in spectacular Silverton, Colorado."
2,"some interesting stuff, but wordy would be an understatement","Strong points: THIS is fascinating stuff about schizoid personalities (emotionally detached, withdrawn personalities), and though Guntrip doesn't always say so, I think in varying degrees it's relevant to pretty much everyone I know...in terms of people's emotions being split off from their conscious selves (thus the schism). also: the occasional chunk of strong case material.WEAK POINTS: are you willing to wade through hundreds of pages of literal word-noise and jargon to get his underlying points, which he seems to make over and over and over and over and over again in a million slightly different ways?if you're the type of person who has trouble skimming and feels obligated to read every word, I would recommend this book as a good remedy for insomnia."
3,Worth a listen,I am not really even a fan of this musical genre however after seeing Lovett perform on TV one evening I was impressed enough to purchase this CD. It's a bit long for my taste but I'm sure if you're a fan of his you'll thoroughly enjoy the recording.
5,"Not ironic at all...in fact, a total pleasure","Anyone who considers Lyle Lovett's music ""pseudo-country"" is sleeping. Is there no room for someone who's a true innovator and truly original? And if sonmeone the likes of Lyle Lovett wants to pay tribute to the music and writers that influenced him, then I think that's an absolutely wonderful thing and allows those of us who DO appreciate the man's music to see where it all comes from. If Lovett's looks even fall into the equation here, then the reviewer is paying attention to the wrong areas completely. I discovered Lovett with his debut album when I worked in country radio in Florida and have never regretted it a single day. The world needs more Lyle Lovetts."
4,Not disappointing!,"I was prepared not to like this CD as much as I had the past Lyle Lovett releases, since I especially appreciate the artistry in his songwriting. Since the recordings on this 2 CD set are all songs by others, I didn't know what to expect.It's definitely not a disappointment! If you've ever listened to a Lovett song and wondered what he was thinking or how he felt when he wrote it, I think this CD will offer some possible answers. Compiled of songs written by his friends, mentors, heroes and role-models, I think we may know more about what makes him ""tick.""Oh...and by the way, Lyle...gig 'em, Ags!"
3,A break from his usual,"Lyle Lovett has brough a lot of musical pleasure into my life for over a decade now -- having seen him in concert nearly every year (from Scottsdale to Scotland) I can say with absolute certainty that he is generally even more entertaining live. This album however did not possess my favorite qualities in his music. Because he produces what I like to call very diverse 'thinking man's' music, you can listen to his recordings time and time again and never tire of his style. This album was, for me, simply absent of what I enjoy so much about this man and his god given talent."
5,Texas music at its finest!,"Hopefully the rest of the country will wake up and see what Texans have known all along... some of the finest singer/songwriters in the world are in our backyard! If this thing had grooves in it, I would have worn it out by now! Now everyone in the world can feel like a Texan, even if just for an hour! Take the phone off the hook, get your main squeeze, grab a cold beverage, head to the back porch or rooftop, put in this CD and watch the sun fall into the west! Another gem by Lyle. Genius songwriting, wonderful arrangements and 100% Texas! It's a shame that we all can't be in Texas but this CD will put a little Texas in everyone, even if just for an hour! Yee-ha!"
2,Not what I wanted!,It took a long time to receive this product. The fragrance was not Lavender at all. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
2,"Journal part OK, Shopping Guide is a joke","The journal content is good, but the book is a typically-bound softcover which does not lend well to journaling (spiral-bound books which lay open flat or fold back are much better). The biggest disappointment was the Shopping Guide section which, according to the front of the book, ""features shopping lists for fat-flushing foods"". They are merely bulleted lists of foods used in each phase of the plan, grouped by category (vegetables, proteins, etc.) It would have been more helpful to have actual shopping lists by week, based on the plan menus."
5,Excellent Weightloss Resource,"The Fat Flush Journal and Shopping Guide is a wonderful resource. The journal portion of book is laid out very well. It has a section to track all the foods and drinks consumed, as well as a section to record your physical and emotional thoughts for each day. It also contains weekly pages to record your weight and measurements along with your weekly goals. And on top of all that, there is a current listing of the Fat Flush phase appropriate foods....a shopping guide. It is a great tool in creating accoutability for yourself. This book has been instumental in my ability to lose 60 pounds. I highly suggest this book."
1,The Fat Flush Journal and Shopping Guide,Nothing great about this book. Follows the same patterns as many others I have read. Simple common sence guidelines but nothing amazing or new to the readers.
5,A Godsend!,"This little Godsend has lists of nutritious foods to help you plan a healthy meal. Information about the foods, herbs and spices are listed along with websites and addresses of places where you can buy grass-fed cattle and other organic foods.The Shopping Guide is your traveling companion if you are following the Fat Flush Plan (FFP). Even if you are not following the FFP, this book is a wonderfully helpful tool as it is power packed with information about nutritious eating, meal planning and shopping. The book is portable and light and is the ideal shopping list for any phase of the FFP. It also comes with a journal so that people can chronicle their progress. I found the lists extremely helpful and to this day take this book with me whenever I go food shopping. (I'm a regular shopper at the produce markets and at the local health food store).It's a must have when shopping and makes your shopping easier!"
3,Not quite the same........,"If you are anything like me and got into DJ Sammy in 2001 during the ultra trancey remakes of Heaven and Boys of Summer, you may be caught off guard by The Rise. The disc is very different from his first album which was like Hypa Hypa and then with Heaven it was soothing trance. This is comparable to listening to Lasgo or ATC. Remember ATC, la la la la la, yea them. This sounds like the follow up album they never had. Lots of vocals, including one super cheese track with a male singer talking about climbing the highest mountain. I was slapped in the face with a dirty diaper when i put this in my car stereo. Good thing I wasn't driving on the highway or may have gone off the road! It gets a 3 because a few of the tracks are good, but nothing sounds like Rise Again, his debut single. Anyway, use judgement when purchasing this. I don't regret the purchase, I just was not educated on DJ Sammy's apparent ""ever evolving"" nature.Ciao"
2,"Not good at all, dont waste your money","As a fan of different types of trance, and expecting this to be a good cd, I was totally wrong. To put it short, the cd sucks, at least from a Trance point of view. If you liked his track Heaven, DONT waste your money on this cd. There is nothing trancy about it. Maybe one or two songs from the CD, once they are remixed, have some promise, the rest just fade into the back ground."
5,Wonderfully Applicable,"This book was required for a Master's class taken at U of I (IL). It will open your eyes as a teacher. I especially enjoyed the section that discusses Universal Design for Learning. The applictions were very practical. For those wanting to incorporate technology into their lesson plans, this book is for you. It focuses on how to do so for students of all learning types. A great reference book for the future."
5,Must have!,"If just entering the world of understanding what universal design for instruction means, this is a wonderful book easy for any one to understand.I have verbally recommended it to many people that I teach students who are both in regular education and special education classes."
5,Nice Basic Cookbook,"While I agree that her show is a little ""creepy"", Laura Calder's recipes are simple and delicious. Her basil beef is one of the best and easiest dishes I have ever made. Seriously, it takes your cooking to the next level. I just wish this book had pictures with it. That's the only nagative."
3,Feedback for Laura Calder,"My expectations were not met with this book. Because the title matches Laura's TV program, I was expecting to get more of the recipes that she cooks on TV. Also, no photos of the finished dishes was disappointing. However, I did order her book, French Taste, and am very happy with this purchase."
3,Disappointed and Happy!!!!!!,"I am disappointed that quite a few of the recipes from the ""French Food at Home"" television show are not in this book. The chapters are not structured as the television show is; instead I found this a modern take on the 'Elizabeth David' genre, though I am grateful that there is a recipe per page. As I particularly bought the book because of the show, it was not what I was expecting! In saying that, the recipes do not disappoint."
2,Review of French Food at Home.,"There were no pictures of the finished product. I wanted to see receipes and pictures from the T.V, show. There were many recepies that were left out of French Food at home. It needs to be revised. Not an attractive cookbood. Michael Floyd, DVM"
3,Nice book BUT....,Nice book BUT ... with no pictures. When you are cooking you really want to see some pictures of the final product. So you can compare if it's like that o not.
2,Quite a let down,"The online reviews were very positive but when we got the book it turned to be a big disappointment. Too many of the recipes called for relatively exotic ingredients that would be difficult to find a in an ordinary supermarket. For that reason alone, we have not tried out a single recipe yet even though we have looked long and hard to find something to cook from this book."
5,I absolutely love this book...,"I can't remember the last time I connected so deeply with a character. I wanted to wrap Sticky in my arms and take care of him. I absolutely love this book. de la Pena's writing is passionate, it's raw, it's real and full of life. We follow Sticky through adolescence and witness his struggles, his loves (mother, basketball, girlfriend...), his pain and hopes and dreams. de la Pena weaves through past and present seamlessly. He has created a novel with great depth and rich characters. I didn't want it to end.Sticky may have started out ""three stones back"", but you leave with hope that he's going to be all right."
2,very inapropriate,this book is good but has some inapropriate parts. there is alot of swearing and violence. i recomemd this book for people over the age of 13
2,stopid,reading from the start i was confused and i coudnt get hooked on it is relly mind bending i ve read other of matt bookss nd this one is
5,A good read,"I have read all of Nevil Shute's books, so this was a re-read for me. I love how he writes just plain good stories,with decent characters who always do the right thing."
4,A Different Kind of Story,I like Nevil Shute's books because the stories do not follow a certain pattern. They are usually about interesting people and their lives. There is none of this modern day gory or sexy description. He makes his characters very human and mostly humane.
4,Good God This is Heavy!,All the songs are brutal as hell!! And if they slow down at all in a matter of seconds they will shred you to pieces!!
3,Madness it truly is,"If you're reading this review write now, you either like this kind of music or you don't Almost constant double-bass drum all the time, aggressive, pounding vocals, and guitar thrashings that make you wanna rip out someone's throat or bum-rush a dirty homeless guy. This album would get a four if more of their songs didn't sound so alike. The best songs have to be ""Cold Hate, Warm Blood"" and ""Flame to the Surface,"" they both find a special place in my heart. You have to really listen closely to hear how good these guys are, because it's true. Mike DiSalvo is better than Lord Worm at screaming because it doesn't sound like his insides are spewing out onto the mic. It's a good buy if you're into the complete and utter madness Cryptopsy can create."
2,"Mediocre death metal. Not bad, but nothing special.","So much has been written about Cryptopsy, but I fail to see what the big deal is about them. Yes, they are fast and ""technical"", but when I listen to this album, all I hear is standard death metal.How about something with some substance ?How about giving some respect to the pioneers of Canadian death metal, Gorguts !?"
2,CRYPTOPSY - Wanna-be DM!,"I totally agree with the reviewer before me! Cryptopsy have definitely gone mainstream! Hell, people that like Cryptopsy listen to Nile, Cannibal Corpse, Morbid Angel, ect. ect... Cryptopsy are highly overRated like Nile! The vocals aren't very br-oooo-tal! The songs all sound identical, the drumming & vocals practically drown out the guitars. I like their old vocalist (Lord Worm). Well, if ur skeptical about picking up this CD, I think it would be better to go for their previous opus 'None SO Vile' much much better, filled with violent-well played riffs, killer drumming & vokills! I give None SO Vile 5 STARS! Killer CD! Whisper Supremacy belongs in A Microwave! Go & listen to some Centurian or Disciples of Mockery!"
5,Vandoren B45 Dot Bb Clarinet Mouthpiece Review,"What a bargain! I got it for half the retail price, brand new. A much smoother sound. It was my first purchase from Amazon and it won't be my last."
4,"very good book, well worth the money","Very good boox exposing the truth behind mars, the pyramids, and the sphinx, but he kind of goes off on a tangent the second half of the book about asteroids"
3,Like buying two or three book for the price of one,"This is my first time reading a book by Graham Hancock. I have read some of the reviews other people have written and agree for the most part. This book was like two or three different unrelated books combined into one. There was not a smooth transition from the Mars Structures to the End of the world scenario chapters. The book didn't get interesting until the very end when you could tell the author was getting overly excited about what he was writing. Once you read past the ""man has lost its soul and the Gods are angry"" stuff it does make you think about how our solar system isn't the isolated place that we think it to be."
2,Weak but Interesting,"I hope Mr Hancock will put his name on future books that truly represent HIS views and not the dollar signs glistening in the eyes of some publisher. I don't want to know how much Hancock received for lending his name to this thing. I found the material that was written by Hancock to be the only interesting stuff in the whole book. 0n the other chapters - well, don't bother. This is a real reach and somewhat reminiscent of Zecharia Sitchin's views. Oh Please Mr Hancock do not go down the path of Sitchin - give Mr Bauval a phone call. We urge you! You're too good for sensationalistic garbage."
1,Why do people fall for this stupidity?,This book is total nonsense. Do the people who buy these books have any idea what conventional science says? I find it had to believe that the author or the publisher is after anything but money from the myth-informed.
3,"Can be entertaining, but not great.","This book was exactly what I had expected after seeing an interview with Hancock on the Tom Snyder television program. Hancock is asking some interesting questions, and has some interesting theories, but one must read this book with a serious grain of salt. Yet, keeping an open mind can also make reading this book fun. Sometimes it's enjoyable to say ""what if.""The aramageddon astaroid section was a little tiresome, while i have to admit the projections made concerning the after-effects of a direct hit by an asteroid or comet scared this reader.This book is outside of the previaling orthodoxy, so in some respects Hancock has appealed to the conspiracy theorist in this reader, but in the end his arguments just sound sensationalistic. Sorry Graham. Better luck next time."
3,Not up to the mark,I have read Hancock's previous books with interest and Fingerprints is an excellent work. This work is fragmented and loses itself between its multiple authors and multiple threads. This book is not up to the mark and is not a book that I could recommend.Tim Frost
2,A bit Sketchy!,"Although Hanncock has written some excellent books this one seems to be lacking a total direction,not like his others.Cosmic impacts and their effects are of great interest to me,and that solely made me buy this one.Some of his data in this book I feel has since been totally dispoved by the current Mars global surveyor mission images(namely the face on mars and the pyramids,with high resolution imaging).As some of the other reviewers siad ,skip this,and get 'fingerprints of the Gods',if you haven't already."
4,Timely addition to the realization of our violent past,"The solar system is a shooting gallery, with objects in constant motion, sometimes meeting in space with catastrophic results. We've only recently begun to realize how vulnerable our seemingly stable existence is on this planet. With his journalistic skill of extrapolation, Hancock takes our knowledge of Martian topography and presents a fresh theory of how the planet died, and why that has a profound message for all of us on Earth today. The book does have a rushed feel to it, as if it needed to get into print while Pathfinder was still in the news. But it's still a worthwhile read, especially as our stale scientific paradigms are falling apart on a daily basis. Other reviewers seem to have a problem with informed conjecture, don't let them keep you from forming your own opinion."
2,"Serviceable, not his best","Graham Hancock talents are his engaging writing style and his detective skills. His previous works are all marked by a truly arduous hunt for clues, a thorough and cautious analysis('onion' theory notwithstanding), and ultimately a very convincing and original case.Unfortunately, Graham's detective skills are largely wasted on a subject that is so many million miles away. In this book, Graham has no more raw data available to him, than any other writer on the subject; while some of his 'reinterpretations' of the evidence are thought-provoking, their just isn't enough of it to sustain the book. I'm not saying it wasn't interesting, Graham's writing talents alone ensure that; but all in all, I would wait to find it at a used book store."
4,Interesting,"Another excellent work by the author. Mr Hancock is an excellent and interesting writer. He writes in great depth so you can understand the who, what , when, where, how and why of his research and opinions. This book is typical to his writing in that regard. If you are knowledgeable on what he has written the books may cover a lot of ground you have trod in previous times. If you however are a novice in his field of research, you will be amazed at the amount of information he conveys. It is definitely another pass around book!"
3,"The book was interesting, but disappointing.","I had waited anxiously for Graham Hancock's newest book, The Mars Mystery, but was disappointed. It certainly contained important information about potential cosmic threats, but I believe it failed to delve into the ancient Earth/Mars connection as thoroughly as I would have expected from this author. I expected a re-analysis of texts and myths based on the concept of an ancient Martian civilization and how that might have impacted our own. The book was almost tentative in its approach in every area it examined. Mr. Hancock has brought forth revolutionary concepts in his previous books without qualifying them at every turn as he seems to in this work. The book will hopefully help to bring attention to the potential of destructive meteors and comets and spark a demand to devote more resources from our governments to examine these further. I hope we can look forward to more books from Mr. Hancock on his ancient civilization theories in the future."
2,boring,"Hancock wasted a lot of words which I can't make out the point. Actually some of the chapters are interesting enough, but most of them were described too long, until they lost their ideas."
1,Hilarious,"This is truly hilarious. Anyone who doubted Mr. Hancock's grip on reality should check this out. Of course his cult following will believe anything he says or writes, but this book is DE BOMB for his ideas. He uses the same claptrap ""methods"" (basically, pattern recognition as solid evidence) he has used for his other books on the supposed lost civilization of earth and comes to similarly laughable conclusions: Mars had a civilization once. When closer photos of the Cydonia region revealed his monuments to be natural features (some of them actually shifted out of position), he reacts by concocting a NASA conspiratorial mentality founded in Cold War attitudes. For those who place great stock in pattern recognition, isn't this a pattern? When Egyptologists counter his terrestrial claims with hard evidence, he accuses them of conspiracy too!For any thinking reader, this is the last word on Hancock and how far he is prepared to go to justify his increasingly ridiculous claims."
3,Hanchock has written better,"This book doesn't give any real answer to the Mars mystery, but still an ok book to read."
1,Worst set of Oneida Flatware that I own,This is the worse set of flatware that I own. You would think that with the Oneida brand that there would be a quality product but this set is terrible.
5,Excellent Product,"I bought TR-3 primarily to protect my 8-yr old white Tiger Provan RV. I thought it was already pretty clean, but during the application process I observed it was removing layers of previously hard-to-see grime that had turned my baby an off-white (I bought it used several yrs ago so I didn't see the original paint job). Now it is a BRIGHT white! Who knew?I cannot evaluate the durability of the finish yet - but it's a heck of a cleaner at a great price. TIP: rub down in a well-lit area because like restoring an old painting the layers of grease and grime come off in stages so you'll need to see clearly that the applied areas have been cleaned completely."
5,The Best on the Market,We have been using TR3 Resin Glaze since the late 70's. My boss at the time requested that we try it out on our 1976 Honda. He was given a sample bottle from marketing and wanted to see if it was good enough to add to his auto supplies business inventory. It works wonders. Long time use keeps your paint job in excellent condition for years to come. My husband has tried other products on both our domestic and import vehicles and always returns to TR-3. Says nothing on the market works better. We like it for how easy it is to apply and the shine it leaves behind.
2,Odd that I'm going to be the lowest review here...,"For whatever reason, this stuff wasn't the oxidation miracle I was hoping for. I didn't throw the easiest job in the world at it--granted. I was trying to improve the appearance of an older oxidized black car roof. I went over it about 6 times as directed with TR3 and appearance was only moderately improved.Even the final finish on areas of the paint that were in good shape didn't have the glossy sheen I was hoping for when finished.I've had much better luck with Turtle Wax Color Back on oxidation than this product--and I don't think anyone hails that as a top-shelf solution.In general I simply wasn't impressed. I guess it works a little--or maybe it works really well on new car finishes that are in very good shape. Kind of don't know why I didn't have the same great experience as everyone else..."
5,Really enjoyed it,I have really enjoyed this writer and the well done story lines. I continue to pick up the Nero Wolf when I find them.
2,"A cool title, but little else","Murder by the Book by Rex Stout is a murder mystery starring the author's signature sleuth Nero Wolfe. Armed with brilliant powers of deduction, Wolfe is morbidly obese, a glutton, shut-in, recluse, and orchid enthusiast. His loyal assistant Archie Goodwin does all the legwork; Wolfe's keen intellect does the solving, and the two trade witty, good-natured barbs back and forth in between the pieces of the mystery falling into place. Rather than these personality quirks making Nero Wolfe seem interesting or unique, they just make him come across as fat and lazy. In no way is this a compelling yarn."
4,arrived quickly from seller,"good who dunit, a little chauvenistic writing due to the period of hte story."
4,Club/Party Goers Love It!,"It took me a while to warm up to it because of it's ""space-age""-sounding production, which is why I gave it a 4 star rating. The music video is very artistic, however! The ending leaves me with a question mark in my mind, but ever since I played it at a party recently, as long as I left off that part, it kept people on their toes! I always eagerly anticipate anything from Prince as to me he still is one of the funkiest cats around...after a while U get tired of replaying the old hits! I don't doubt Prince's ""musicology"" as he still has a VERY strong fan base and as a fan, I say ""keep on keepin' on!"""
4,Working The Sweat,"There is so much from classic acts that are just going on in the music and radio these days. Prince is no doubt definitely a perfectional example. His latest single still shows he has the classic feeling he used to have back in the 80's. Black Sweat, the second single from his recently released 3121 album, is one of the most infectious tracks Prince has recorded in years. The song is very upbeat and incredibly delightful for not just die hard Prince fans, but also for anybody who hasn't even heard a classic track from this Soul legend. I absolutely love this guilty pleasure track, and it is purely sweatting out for everyone.Song: B+"
5,Rivers Edge,"Was a good quality movie,I absolutly love this movie one if my favorites from the 80 s hadnt been able to find it anywhere else ."
5,Pre-Columbine 80's drug-and-metal culture gone awry,"The reviewer's comment about 60's nihilism was right on target. It's also interesting to compare/contrast this true story with the late 90's student gunmen. Whereas the River's Edge group acted out of sheer apathy and/or completely muddled loyalties, the Luke Woodham cult and Columbine killers were driven and ""inspired"" and acted on gruesome premeditated plans. The movie also portrays the group perfectly as ""hoods"" (at least that was our colloquial name for them growing up in the 80's) -- the blue-jean jacket-donning, long-haired ""metalhead"" kids who were both philosophically and chronologically the intermediaries between 60's ""greasers"" and current ""goths."""
1,Worthless dreck,"One of the worst films I have ever seen. First off, Crispin Glover has to be the most annoying actor ever to walk the face of the earth. (Is it me or is his voice like nails on a chalkboard?) Then you throw the second worst in there--Keanu Reeves. There are better films about Gen X'ers than this worthless dreck."
3,It doesn't age well,"When I first saw this back in 1988, the movie really seemed riveting and menacing. A lot changes in 11 years! RIVER'S EDGE now just seems very contrived and over-the-top. The one enduring element it's retained is Frederick Elmes' incredible cinematography. It makes me wonder what some of the movies of ""teens in trouble"" that were made during the Nineties are going to seem like in 11 years. What a shame......"
5,Death and Apathetic Teens,"This movie really shows how dangerous apathy can be. It's both sad and scary to see that only one of the teens actually seems to care about what might happen to his murderous friend. Though the tale is a dark one, the acting of Crispin Glover really cracked me up. To be honest, I bought this movie just from seeing clips of his character, Layne, and I'm very glad that I did. Aside from Glover's hilarious lines, Keanu Reeves does a good job as a sort of ""front man"" for the story.Don't buy this expecting a happy ending, because really, how happy can things be when a girl has been killed by a former friend? But it's definitely worth checking out, especially if you like Crispin Glover. (You can tell I'm a big fan from my review of ""Willard"" as well.) Keanu Reeves fans will probably enjoy it, too, because he perfectly emulates the laid-back 80s teen that drinks and smokes but doesn't go too overboard like he did in his Theodore ""Ted"" Logan role."
3,Interesting,"3.5 starsJust saw this for the first time. Might have been a big deal 20 years ago, now it seems almost ironic. No one cares anymore about going to war with any country we're told is full of terrorists, so this is kid's stuff.Keanu is so bad here that it's pretty funny. Glover is so weird that he actually carries this film, I'd say.This is a topic worth exploring and a decent job of doing just that. Not great but pretty good, and most of the performances are solid, except old Mr. Reeves. My God he's helpless! Always looks cute though so that's why they keep hiring him 20 years later I guess. He seems perpetually confused in almost all of his roles. Type-casting?Ione Skye was believably annoying, and Keanu's kid brother may have stolen this film if not for Glover's goofiness.Worth seeing."
4,"Great film, but ...",Just a note about the DVD: The lack of extras is disappointing. It'd be nice to think there'll be a future release with a Tim Hunter commentary. And it seemed to me that the framing is all wrong. It looks as though the picture is blown up resulting in information lost on all four sides. Or maybe a cropped-at-the-sides 4:3 copy was taken and that was then cropped at top and botton to get the 16:9 shape.
2,lacking important info,"1) Konjar Root Flour is very helpful to moderate diabetes and lower cholesterol.As always, it is better to get through food sources, but supplements are also available.

4,first Brando movie,Touching even though it is a little predictable. Supposed to be Marlon Brando's first movie. Watching the soldier evolved really holds your interest.
3,Still a good film despite unevenness,"Marlon Brando's first feature film, ""The Men"" tells the story of a group of injured veterans of WWII who try to put their lives together. Overall I feel this is a well-done film, as it's not pretentious as many such films tend to be. Brando turns in solid performance, even though at times he over-acts which makes his character less than believable. The g/f character, unfortunately, is not very likeable; the actress never seems to get into the role, and there's little chemistry between her and Brando. The best chacrater is Dr. Brock; it's probably because of my own exposure to such physicians that I find him very believable and powerful.In the end, the reason to watch this film is really to see Brando as a first-time feature actor. He *is* good. Many of the supporting actors are good, too; unfortunately the second half of the film seems too hurried and becomes shallow compared to the first half. I think this is a movie not to be missed."
5,Marlon's best movie ever ...,"Everyone raves about Streetcar, but this one has always been my favorite. Marlon has never looked better than in this movie and I think his acting was a sign of how great he would become. My absolute favorite."
5,What this movie represents TODAY,"I have to say if you do not watch this movie and understand how important the meanind of this film is, you never knew a veteran. Some may not know this but this movie is based on a true story. This true story is still present today, helping our Paralyzed Veterans and all American Veterans. The beginnings of the organization Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) was what this movie is based upon.I am thankful for the PVA. If you do not know who PVA is, check out their website pva.org. They still have the same will and dedication of Marlon Brando's character.I suggest you grab some popcorn and a drink, pop in this DVD and enjoy. Then donate some money to the wonderful organization of PVA."
4,THE MEN,"Nice story about ex combat veterans and how they have to face their toughest enemy, the wheelchair. An enemy they can't fight against with force of arms. They have to fight it with the realization that they must make an ally of this chair with wheels. And the doctor who treats them, knowing all along, he can never make them whole again."
2,"OK, But...","If you have never used a metal lathe before, it has some useful info. BUT, be prepared for some of the worse use of the King's English language. You will find yourself constantly re-reading a paragraph and asking yourself, ""didn't he really mean..."" or ""What the heck is he trying to say here..."""
1,Too much introduction; where's the exercise video?,"I was really disappointed in this video. After watching 30 minutes of unexciting explanation of Ms. Marmorat's dance routine, I quit. I don't know if there is actually an exercise video after the narration ends because I never made it to the end. In addition, the routine being explained was more of a dance routine than what I consider to be an exercise routine. The video is just sitting on the shelf unused now."
1,"Nice idea, poor execution","Like the other review I think this is a poorly executed DVD. However, on the flip-side, I felt that there wasn't enough instruction. You were pretty much expected to already know the moves and what was coming up to be able to execute the routine. There was no breaking down of the moves so you could learn them. I did about 20 minutes before I gave up. Looking for another workout DVD now."
4,Better than my $5 plastic flashlight,"$8 is just about right for this light. It is not as bright as I expected given the xenon bulb and three cells, but it is a bit brighter than my generic 2 cell flashlight. Where it is shines is in its construction. It is solidly built and doesn't have the loose fitting, knock-it-against-your-hand-to-get-it-to-light quirkiness of a cheaper flashlignt. This same light sells for over twice the price at Ace."
1,Excercise--NOT STRETCHING!!!,"This video is awful. Any stretching classes that I have taken are done a a slow pace as not to cause any injury. Her ""warm up"" is done at such a fast pace it feels like exercise. If you are looking for something like yoga without all the poses, as I was, this is NOT it. The title should have definitely included the words excercise, not stretching!"
3,dump the first half and it's great!,"Bad points- 1) The first half is boring. Buchanan versus the Anti-Masons. We are treated to every detail of their fight but I couldn't tell you what one stood for versus the other except that they both wanted to be in office...2)Little detail into Buchanan's personal Life. What made him tick? Aside from ""If it isn't in the Constitution, it's wrong"", we get nothing.3)Little about Ann Coleman considering the size of the book.4)Nothing about what endeared him to Queen Victoria despite this being his greatest accomplishment?!Good points- 1)meticulous detail2) gets very exciting as the secession crisis develops."
2,Be very careful about which edition you buy.,"The edition I bought was a scanned edition of the book, which is in the public domain. The scanning is HORRIBLE. Let me make sure you understand, it is very bad. They included pictures that are totally unrecognizable as anything except maybe a line drawing of something or other. The actual text is blurry and whole letters can only be recognized in context. I wanted a bio that was published before the current reevaluation of President Buchanan which is why I got this one. But this must be a first generation scan and nothing was ever done to clean up the scan. Please buy a readable copy of this book."
4,Teas,"A great mild tasting cup of tea. I enjoy this as a breakfast tea for it's gentle flavor, you may want to try this one for your own stock."
3,"Good high level review, lack of flesh and details.","This is an excellent introduction to the subject of Judaism and magic & superstition.It covers broad territory - powers of good & evil, demons, holy names, medicine, amulets, divination, dreams, and more - and supplies an extensive bibliography for those interested to continue studying any of the subjects in the book.What I didn't find in the book is details or flesh - the book has a lot of breadth, but just scratches the surface on each of the subjects. Also, the book gives details about the customs of German Jews at specific centuries, but rarely mentions customs of, say, Jews from Islamic countries.So if you're looking for an introduction, this is the book for you. If you're looking for depth, I suggest books such as Aryeh Kaplan's."
4,Do you believe in magic?,"This book is the author's doctoral thesis from Hebrew Union College and was first published in 1939. Yet it is accessible to the general reader. It is fascinating to see the probable origins of so many traditional Jewish practices. The need for what is described as magical interventions was so strong the the Rabbis of old could not always disallow them. The question of the divide between what constitutes faith versus what is magic and superstition will likely arise in the reader but it is not the intention of this book to speak to this. There are a few frustration with this book. The author makes many assertions without being referenced, despite the plethora of other scholarly citations. Also there are frequent quotations in German, a language that scholarly readers of that day would know, but they are left untranslated in this edition. Finally, there is no index, though there is a glossary and othre supporting material."
3,Important essays,"Very useful collection of essays, but the introduction is, contrary to what the previous reviewer thinks, not very clear; it skirts around the issue of the narrative and gets repetitive, although it's useful for a survey of historical changes of the conception."
2,not inside the space station,"Out of about 45 minutes total, maybe 15 minutes are in space. Of this some is space station Mir, some is looking at Earth, and only maybe 7 minutes is actually ""inside the space station"". Most of the Video is things like survival training in Alaska, people designing robots for space, or computer simulations of what the space station is planned to look like. So it is mostly not what I was expecting/hoping for. But the short time that was in space was very good."
4,Interesting aand a good overview,This video jumps around a lot but always comes backwith many little known details that make it worthwatching. It looks very enjoyable on the space station.
2,"I would not buy these again - in fact, I wish I returned them!","My Mom bought me this set for my anniversary two years ago. We use it regularly and run it through the dishwasher and it is just horrible looking. It spots and marks pitifully. I can't get most of the spots off no matter what I do. I wrote the company to complain and they said they would replace it if I mailed it in, but with the weight of the set (because it really is a heavy-duty set of flatware) it would have cost me a fortune to ship it to them and then all I would have gotten in return was another set of flatware that would probably look the same way in a short period of time. So, I am just putting my experience out there to help others make an informed decision."
2,OK,"They are ok for my needs and the price was right. They seem to rust a bit in the dishwasher, yet I guess you get what you pay for."
2,would have appreciated a box in better condition,"Having bought this item for a friends wedding gift, I was a bit upset when the package arrived and upon inspection found that the box was actually torn. This looks like I purchased the silverware at a yard sale or bargain bin. The only positive thing was that it arrived on time."
4,e is for empire: A new york alphabet book,this entire series is fantastic! the pictures are great. the information is easy. Two levels - the basic is appropriate for childrens ages 3-6 while on the side there is a higher level of information regarding the book you are reading. This literally grows with your child. Hats off all involved with the series - I cannot rave enough over these books.
3,Merely Magic review kindle edition,"I bought this on kindle after having read the original in paperback. This version has been revised - in some places drastically. This is more than a word or sentence revision. Perhaps if I had never read the first version it would be just fine. But I did and there are aspects I liked better in the original version. If you are partial to the original paperback version, don't bother to buy the kindle."
2,Average,"Some might enjoy this book but it didn't do much for me. The beginning happened too fast and then the story became very...very slow paced.Drogo was intolerable for me as well as those women who follow him. Ninian was too submissive and didn't do anything to defend herself. She didn't want to be an outcast but made no effort at all. When someone constantly doesn't listen, you would think they would do something about it. Ninian just kept repeating herself and Drogo just never listened. I also didn't like the fact that Drogo treated Ninian, even when he found out she was prego with his baby. The relationship was just too forced. There was no attraction build up. It was just too flat and too many characters to follow.I only read a third of the book and skipped to the end. The end wasn't anything special either. Overall, eh..."
3,Mundane,"I've been a big fan of P. Rice for a while, but this one just didn't cut it for me. As one reviewer said ""The secondary characters were more interesting than the main ones"" The plot also seemed a bit thin as the story focused more on the heroine's pregnancy and her issues with having the child in her own town than it did with any magical issues, which the summary leaves one to assume is the main part of the story.All in all, it left me a bit blah. For 89 cents I'd say go ahead and read it. I wouldn't pay more though."
3,A different approach,"This being my first Patricia Rice novel, I have mixed feelings about her talents as a Romance novelist. Very interesting take on the game of love with some original ideas on relationships. The Malcom/Ives mythology is ingenious! However, I feel that the hero, Drogo was still too unaccepting and blind to Ninian's ""gift"" for comfort...that does not bode for a happily ever after...Other than the continued reinforcement of Drogo's inability to ""listen"" as Ninian put it, the book was a unique read, that has me waiting for a development of the different members of Drogo's family. Such as the mysterious Adonis, Dunstan and even meddlesome, manipulative Sarah."
3,Well...it's okay,"I didn't start off reading this first book in the series. I kind of went backwards through it and I finally was able to find Merely Magic at an affordable price (since apparently it's no longer on bookstore shelves). I absolutely loved the other books in the series, but to me, Merely Magic was just kind of dull. I imagine if you begin with this book and then make your way through the series, it will be fine. However, I wouldn't suggest this book to those of you who have already read the other books in the series...unless you just want to know the actual story of Ninian and Drogo."
4,Very nice idea...,"Purchased these as a gift for a gourmet chef. Very nice packaging - good looking gift. Tiles are quite plain, but nice."
1,DO NOT BE MISLED BY THE TITLE,"RACIST. This word summarizes the book. It's thoroughly anti-semitic. The author believes in the superiority of the ""Aryan Race"", and tries promote it throughout the book. He even refers to black people as savages."
1,POOR customer service from AMAZON and LUGGAGE ONLINE for luggage,"DO NOT order from Luggage Online and/or Amazon. It took them 48 hours to tell me that they were canceling the order I placed because the goods were out of stock (items similar to this one). At the time of my order, the ""Pricing and Availability:"" chart indicated they were IN STOCK and ready to ship. Save yourself the frustration. Their system clearly does not work well."
4,Great to do in a pinch!,"I really liked this DVD that features eight short workout segments that can be mixed and matched. It has one cardio workout that is short, but challenging. The moves include walking, grapevines, cha-chas, and chasses. You will break a sweat. There are also six ten-minute toning segments: two for abs, two for thighs, two for buns. There is a mind/body routine for a cool-down or just to relax. The scenery is tropical and beautiful and the toning exercises are basic and proven to be effective. Denise is enthusiastic and encouraging, as usual."
4,not that bad!!!,"i liked it a lot-but i also have to say that i skipped that aerobic workout completely. i've been to several aerobics classes before but it still was really hard to catch up on what she was doing. so i prefer to work out on the elliptical trainer or something like that and then do her exercises. i think the exercises are great and i really feel something happening in those wobbly abs :-)now, if you want a exercise video to do some aerobic workout at home-no, don't buy it. if you just want the exercises-go for it.she's really going to motivate you!!!"
2,Not that great!,"This is the 8th workout dvd that I've purchased and I'll have to say it's second to last of my favorites. I like the Three 10 minute sessions the best, but the 30 minute aerobics are very weak. Denise jumps around on the lawn for 30 minutes, and it seems like she's just making up things to do. It's not that bad really, but I guess that the quality of the whole dvd (which must have been a video transfer) makes it seem worse than it is (maybe?). At any rate this is definitely one that you could skip. If you're looking for a really good workout dvd try Donna Richardson's 3 day rotation or Quick Fix, they are both great."
1,Don't waste your money!,"THis DVD is a JOKE! The ""fat burning"" cardio workout is only 20 minutes, and there's no lead-in introduction for the next move. The quality and sound of the DVD is terrible! However, the specific ""hit the spot"" portions for abs, buns and thighs isn't bad; good exercises and emphasis on proper form and technique. If I had it to do over, I wouldn't buy it. The only useful portion for me was the three specific exercises."
5,Denise Austin workouts are very accomodating,"I have bought workouts from a variety of physical fitness trainers, but I always go back to Denise Austin and now that's all I will purchase. For one, I like her short workouts, from 10 to 20 minutes. They accomodate busy schedules as you can do one, or if you have time, combine them for a longer workout. A major reason I like Denise Austin is that her workouts are easy enough for the average person to follow and feel successful, she doesn't do those maniac fitness routines that are impossible to accomplish and leave you feeling frustrated. I lost 50 pounds after pregnacy working out to her videos. Now I just use them along with a rowing machine to keep in shape for horse back riding (I ride hunters over fences) and toned legs and thighs are a must. I can't recommend all of her videos enough."
3,Forgot the arms?!?,"I just got the DVD, which was recommended by a friend and I was very disappointed to find that this series does not include the upper body in the work out. I was under the impression that this would also include the full body work out since it was not otherwise stated."
4,Not literature but nice and useful,"Ruth is pretty much a one-note song (mulch, Mulch, MULCH) but it's nice to know that I'm not alone in using tons of hay to mulch my gardens. This isn't literature and Ruth is, at times, a bit too folksy but given that my method of gardening isn't much different, I would probably write a lot like her. It turns out I've been a Ruth devotee for a while without even knowing it.If you are not using mulch in your garden/landscape and are tired of weeding and looking at hard, baked dirt, you owe it to yourself to give Ruth a shot. Though written in 1960, the book is still relevant and useful (except the parts about parsnips and turnips :-)."
3,"Love Ruth Stout, but there's not a whole lot in this book","I've seen some of the Ruth Stout videos on YouTube and I ADORE her (R.I.P. Ruth). The writing style is very much like her videos would suggest, you can hear her voice in every word.However, on the practical side, the primary thing you will learn from the book is PUT STRAW OR HAY MULCH ON EVERYTHING IN YOUR GARDEN AND YOU WILL HAVE VERY LITTLE WORK TO DO WHILE ENRICHING YOUR SOIL. There, I just saved you some money.It's still rather sweet, I'm just not sure that beyond the primary tip I just revealed, you'll gain much else here that you can't gain from any other source on gardening. Ruth still rocks though!"
5,Oneida Obelus flatware,The Oneida Obelius flatware was received in the box and and the plastic sleeves in new condition.
2,Poor quality,This cell phone comes with a European connection for 220 current. It is poorly made and feels very cheap.
5,Beautiful,I ordered this for my daughter for her birthday. What a beautiful poem from a mother to a daughter. The colors are perfect and the words just say it all. I would highly recommend getting this for a daughter to let them know just how much they mean to you. I know she will look at this everyday and know how much I love her. I give this poem 5 stars and 2 thumbs up. Thank you.
1,Over my head I guess,I watched the film from start to finish and had no clue what was going on. One brother is white and the other is black yet no one around the substituted brother notices the difference.I guess I need to start taking drugs to understand stuff like this.
2,Suture,"Suture is a fascinating and haunting example of surrealism. The movie is filmed in black and white to remind us nothing is simply black and white. The Towers home is a surreal, sterile atmosphere with winding staircases that remind us of the twisted reality of this family.Two brothers meet for the first time at their father's funeral. The acknowledged son is rich in money but totally lacking in warmth and has no friends. Apparently he also lacks a conscience. The other son is a poor blue-collar worker but a caring, warm person who easily makes friends. There is much talk in the film about the brothers looking so much alike and yet they look nothing alike physically. In fact one brother is black and the other white, but skin color is not the main difference here. You keep wondering when someone is going to open his or her eyes and notice. If you don't want to think, don't watch this movie."
2,A disappointing waste of money and time...,"Some very basic forms (3-5 was it?), with only a very beginner level of understanding is conveyed. I'm sure the teacher knows the ""real stuff"", but instead we're treated to non-realistic attacks being countered with ""Feeding Crane"" style...which primarily consists of a block and a hit. A block and a hit. A block and a push. A block and a hit and a kick.Furthermore, for some reason, they decided to show a European perspective in the beginning complete with Gregorian Monk chants (which sound like a rip off of Enigma).Very disappointing. I was hoping for discussion of pressure points (none), perhaps some locks/breaks (none), or even a bit of comparison between this and Okinawan Karate. This looks virtually nothing like the ""White Crane"" style that Yang Jwing Ming promotes. I don't recommend it. It get's 2 stars for being well-filmed though.For someone just starting out in martial arts however, this might be interesting."
4,Thunder Power,"I own the original VHS of this video and have recently purchased the DVD of it. I have also attended one of Liu sifu's seminars. The techniques are as compellingly powerful as they appear, creating a mute internal snapping sound referred to as ""thunder power"" by Sifu. It is unfortunate that the application section in the video does not show more of Liu sifu's many techniques and combinations, which are at once dizzyingly fast and terminal. There is no chin-na in Feeding Crane, just brutal dislocation and/or breakage of joints (wrists, elbow, shoulder, neck, knee, etc). I can vouch for Liu sifu's amazing power and internal control."
2,Old Fashioned Stereotypes,This devotional makes the assumption that the wife stays home and the husband goes to work. My husband and I found the frequent examples referring to this type of marriage to be very distracting to the actual content of the devotional.I suspect that many modern day couples where both spouses work out of the home and share responsibilites in the house would have trouble with this book.
2,"Great book if your older than 50, or your a stay at home mom!","This book is traditional, not every women is staying home washing the dishes while her husband works. The examples are very old fashioned."
4,Excellent insights but the illustrations are a stretch,My wife and I have really enjoyed this book. It's gets right to the heart of real issues that need to be worked on for a marriage to be healthy. Our only complaint has been that sometimes the illustrations used to make the point seem a little unrealistic. But the principles and concepts are great. It's been very helpful for us!
5,We love this book!,My husband is pretty selective when it comes to finding a devotional and he loves this one. Each study comes with discussion questions at the end and we have found them very helpful in starting some meaningful conversations between us. We highly recommend this book.
5,Jude Rules!,"In No One Is Really Beautiful, we get to view the world from the perspective of a very talented and wonderful young man. The lyrics are emotional and powerfully moving, relating experiences most of us can tailor to an experience we have had ourselves. The music is creative and catchy, and also evokes feeling from a listless listener. I highly recommend this album for a rainy day, or driving long distance, when you can hear the album in full."
5,Incredible lyrics!,I haven't gotten this into a cd in a really long time. The lyrics are very real and what an incredible voice!
3,a patron saint,"It's fun Pop, true -- yet, unlike most music in the genre, Jude's is intelligent. His beat certainly favors melody, but the sardonic zest in his lyrics dispense a satisfying bite. And, while much of Jude's praise has been focused on his lyrics, let it be said that he and his accompanying musicians create more than just pretty tunes. They create a varied topography that keeps a Pop-skeptical listener engaged."
5,"As Jude would say, on a scale of 1 to 10.....a 23","Just plain one of the greatest recordings of the last 20 years. Oh how I wish there was more like this. You have to search long and hard to find song writing and musical talent of this calibre. This is a tour-de-force and shames the vast majority of main stream music. My highest recommendation. If you don't like this, you have no soul."
5,interesting and wonderful,"I ordered this album off line a few years ago for the ""I Know"" track. I was wonderfully surprised to find the rest of the CD equally as spectacular. The lyrics are fun and ironically beautiful. The music takes you through the entire spectrum of moods. This is a good one to try and it has earned a space on my ""Favorite CDs"" list."
5,huge talent,"this is a great album... jude has a beautiful voice, and great lyrics that are sometimes sad, and sometimes funny, but always highly original. almost every song on the cd is superb, but my favorites are ""i know, ""i do"", battered, broken"", and ""i'm sorry now""."
4,"Male version of ""chick rock""","I've finally found the male equivalent of all the female soloists who've been dominating the music scene of late. Great songwriting, great voice, nice acoustic. Much more folk than pop/rock, especially in terms of song depth. Whole album is worth listening to. First album I've bought by a guy in a long time (and would have never heard of him but saw him live last night opening for Sinead Lohan). Breaking out will be near impossible for him, but if you found this page you should definitely buy this album. My only wish is more electric -- he shines there too."
3,"Self-conscious, too poppy","The songs on this album have the potential to be really good. A couple of them have funky hooks, but they are just not taken to their full potential. Jude makes too many compromises and is too self-conscious on this album. He is obviously very talented and needs to stop over-analyzing his own lyrics and just create. If you want something stronger, try Beck."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I wasn't expecting much from this film when I ordered it. Set in the late 50's and involving a professor and a change girl, I just didn't expect it to go anywhere for me. I couldn't have been more wrong. I absolutely loved it. The acting was strong and very realistically done. I thoroughly enjoyed this and would recommend it fully."
5,"Review of ""Desert Hearts""","I first saw this film in a theater in the 1980's when it was released. I believed it to be outstanding then and upon seeing it again, consider it a remarkable story especially since it takes place in the late 1950's. It was a gutsy film for the director and actors to make at the time. It is my understanding that a sequel is in the works. I look forward to seeing it. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys human stories about love and acceptance."
5,86 Was A Very Good Year!!!,"Despite the fact that this movie was released the same year that I was born, it hasn't dated a bit. This due to the fact that is was set in the 1950's, and the music and scenery represent this era beautifully.I found the characters to well represented by both the lead actresses (Helen Shaver and Patricia Charbonneau)and the story was believable and enthrawling. Out of so many lesbian themed films on offer this is certainly one of my favourites. I watched it twice within 24 hours after first purchasing it. I had never seen it before buying it and I have to say it was money well spent."
5,coming out,i first saw this movie 14yrs ago on bravo.. i knew i felt different about women then men. this movie opened my heart because i had the same feeling as the professor.. within a few days i finally told someone i thought i was a lesbian.... finally i had my identity!!!! this movie will always be close to my heart
4,love story,This movie was the first lesbain movie I truly fell in love with. I felt my self in the movie through each sceen.I would love to have seen the stars go into more detailed sex sceens. But you can still feel the love. It was a very good love story. It would please me to see a part 2 to this movie.
4,A little cliched but OK,"This was the first movie I ever saw dealing with these themes,so as such, it remained in my mind for a long time.Looking at it now, it seems a little cliched - ""prim and propermeets free spirit"" kind of thing, but the subject is handledwell and Helen Shaver's slow realization of what is happeningto her is very believable and quite moving.As for Ms Charbonneau, she is almost a cypher, but let's faceit she is there just for Helen Shaver to play off of."
2,Okay,"The film was okay. I would not recommend buying it, but it's okay to rent. Vivian Bell (Helen) and Patricia Charbonneau (Cay) gave strong performances as the ""professor"" and the ""wild card"" who fall in love. The shy glances exchanged between them were sexy and natural. Also, the slow, intimate sex scene was very erotic, even more so because the director chose to eliminate a musical backdrop and focus on the two women's passionate breathing. Audra Lindley (Frances) also turned in a strong performance as Cay's alcoholic stepmother. Some of the supporting characters were weak (especially Cay's best friend) and some of the lines were lame. But overall, a good effort for a first-time director.I'm sure Deitch will turn out much better cinema in the future. Final advice: Rent."
4,Really sexy moments in an otherwise so-so film!!!,"I liked this one, but only because I've always felt that nothing is more erotic than one woman sexually seducing another woman! I mean, even your so-called ""adult films"" can't do these scenes right! But ""Desert Hearts"" came through very well in this regard! Patricia Charboneau is the very attractive lesbian cassino worker, who sets her sights on Helen Shaver, the uptight recent divorcee. Their eventual encounter in a Las Vegas motel room, with Shaver's character reluctant, but Charboneau determined to have her, was HOT! I really liked these women, and that made the sexual scenes all the more appealing!"
4,Hottest Lesbian Love Story Ever!!,"...and the performances weren't bad, either!! A star making vehicle for Patricia Charbonneau and Helen Shaver!!"
4,Great Movie but.......,"I am not talking about the movie itself but the DVD version. (most of user reviews here are truly great and insightful!)If you watched the original release in theater, you would notice that dvd version is a little shorter. About 5 minutes shorter. Yes they cut off part of the love scenes where Vivian and Cay made love in hotel for the first time.I read one of the reviews here that mentioned brief love scene, and this is why. It is a little disappointed that the dvd version is not a completed one.Although this movie is still great regardless, I still would like to see the full-length movie in future dvd or VHS version.By the way if you like Desert Heart, you may like these too :Lianna, Tipping the velvet, boys dont cry, all about my mother, and ma vie en rose. :)"
5,Desert Hearts dvd movie w/ extras,"I ordered this movie here, and was very pleased with it and it's extras dvd disc as well. It was recommended to me by a friend. It is now part of my favorites collection ."
4,This is a very enjoyable movie....,"no matter what walk of life you are in. This movie is loosely based on the book ""Desert of the Heart"" written by Jane Rule. Given the budget and the difficult task of making Ms. Rule's book come to the screen I believe they did a great job. The movie takes place in 1959 with the sound track and sets you don't have a problem believing it. The direction/acting are well done and the chemistry between the characters is believable. Also, if you haven't read the book, do so...."
2,Nothing to it,"This movie attempted to share a story about relationships. All of which, were strained, and not really given time to develop. Amazingly true, of the main characters and their interactions. Don't really know much about their thoughts or what they shared [other than the obvious].Overall, the plot is a fine idea. The content and structure of this film all fall short. Really wish I hadn't rented it, as it wasn't worth the $3. Disappointed."
3,Good Story but slow moving,"The cast was good, the people were decent actors, just moved kind of slow for me. Not sure I would spend the money on the video again if I had it to do over. It's just hard to rent gay movies, it's easier to buy them."
4,"Good quality, good price",ive had this flatware for about 8 months and I have found them servicable and of good quality. Also the low price doesnt hurt
5,Truly useful.,"I purchased several of the handbooks for our medical office. We care for high risk OB patients, many of whom are Spanish speaking only. Even our Spanish speaking medical assistants have found the book helpful in finding words they don't use frequently, but need in our setting."
5,Great for Medical terms... Spanish-English (Que' Excelente),"If you're looking for a bilingual dictionary with medical terms in Spanish, this is an excellent and useful book. Knowing some Spanish and assisting Spanish speakers at a local clinic one summer, this dictionary was very helpful.English to Spanish, and Spanish to English. It even has diagrams of the body, facial features, bone structure, and the different systems. Although it shows the reproductive organs, there is no maternal diagrams (or any with a baby).For people starting Spanish, I suggest a beginner's dictionary first. Some words and slang you may not use in a hospital may not be listed. But words such as spider, gunshot, and house are translated (since someone could have a bug-bite or bullet wound).This is great to look at.I highly recommend this to those using Spanish in a Medical field. Doctors that don't know Spanish may still find it useful.It's small enough to fit in your purse (or a large pocket)."
2,truth in advertising ...,"I have to admit this was an impulse purchase - therefore i was sorry to experience first hand the time honored adage ""don't judge a book by its cover"" or in this case, cover photo ... so much for surfing the net at 2 a.m. If truth be told, this is a very adequate little book, but it's ... tiny. If you are over 40 you'll need at least a +5 pair of reading glasses, and if you're a grown man turning the tiny pages can be frustrating.The good - useful medical spanish-english terms, portableThe bad - teeny tiny, the font size is about 6, and the pages are thin and stick togetherThe ugly - overpriced for what you get, as the little old lady used to ask, ""where's the beef?""I was too astonished by my poor judgment to return the book, and have lost it in my desk drawer at work. Besides, my medical Spanish-English app on my phone is more handy and user friendly.=O"
5,For those that are learning,"Rabbi Parry truly made me feel that I am an integral part of the Jewish nation. I didn't know much when I started learning, and sharing with my family has increased our knowledge tremendously. Very readable, very informative."
2,Not for Beginners,"Not knowing what to do with the food processor I received as a birthday gift, I came across this book. Other reviews made it sound like the ideal cookbook. I'm no expert in the kitchen (far from it) and couldn't find any recipes in this book that sounded easy or like anything my children would eat. There was even a recipe for mayonaise which made me wonder why anyone would make their own. This might be a great cookbook for those with time and the desire to create gormet meals, but it's not very useful for the remedial cook like me and it made me even less likely to ever take the food processor out of the box. I'm afraid I will be sending this book back."
5,GREAT,"Someone just gave me a copy of PROCESS THIS! and to be honest, I didn't think it was a book I'd use. Then I saw the author show how to make a killer fat-free ice cream at a local bookstore and was blown away. I've now made at least a dozen recipes from the book and they have all been terrific. And EASY. One night I served the Sweet Potato Soup with Coconut Milk, Lemongrass, and Cilantro, and man, was it a hit. I also love the Toasted Hazelnut Tart, Jansson's Temptation, Swiss Steak and Lemon Poppy Seed Cupcakes.I never knew I could make cake in a food processor and I certainly never knew I could make ice cream in it in a couple of minutes. Amazing! Now that I know how many things I can make in my food processor, I'm going to keep it out on the counter. There are a lot of other recipes in the book that sound really good and I'm going to try them soon"
5,America's Best Kept Secret!!,"This album is truly phenomenal! This woman's voice is sultry and hypnotic, while the songs take us through a roller-coaster of emotions. That said, how come no one has heard of Rachael Indigo?? Well, no one in the US has, but she's becoming a star overseas. The Japanese - once more - are ahead of the curve, and will be graced with 10 concerts this Summer headlined by this lovely lady.Recipe for coolness:1. Buy this album.2. Tell all your friends about it.3. Wait a year or so until Rachael Indigo becomes a worldwide superstar.4. Tell your friends ""I told you so!"" and become an instant music-connoisseur genius."
1,so so,"A lot of computer books only talk computer including this one. I think it is the so so book, but readers may understand computer hardware and how to assemble a computer after they read it."
2,Pretty bare bones phrase book,"This was the cheapest phrase book that I saw offered on Amazon.com and, as trite as it is, you get what you pay for. If you are looking for the most basic of interactions with Italian speakers and are only planning on staying in tourist hotels and shopping in tourist markets, then this might suffice. However, if you are planning to interact with native Italian speakers in a less superficial way, or if you want to be able to express yourself with somewhat more sophistication, I would recommend another phrase book."
1,Gerard F.,"This book is worthless, even for $2. Very outdated (phrases about telegrams). I returned it. Buy Rick Steve's Italian Phrases instead. It is more compact and current (asks how to send an e-mail, not telegram)."
3,Easy equals Beginner,"This book is too large to fit in your pocket. It has normal size type but lots of space between the entries. Check out other options and you will find a smaller, more useful reference."
2,Low phrase count makes product nearly useless,"The title promises 770 basic phrases. Easily three quarters or more of these ""phrases"" are simply the same phrase repeated, with only a word or two difference. An example from page 34: Phrase #424 is ""I should like to have [some cake]."" Phrases 425 - 430 then tell you how to say you want pie, cheese, cookies, custard, chocolate ice cream and vanilla ice cream. Hm, couldn't I just have consulted a pocket dictionary? Meanwhile, the section on ""Difficulties and Repairs"", (i.e. situations where you might really need a phrase book), there are a mere 13 phrases!I found this book nearly useless for my purposes. There aren't nearly enough phrases to rely on the book as an on-the-spot, pocket communication tool, largely because it substitutes too much vocabulary for phraseology. And yet it doesn't have nearly enough vocabulary to make me feel like I could get away without having a pocket dictionary."
4,Easy Italian Phrase Book,Helps a lot when traveling abroad. Keeps us from being ugly in a foreign country. I recommend for any age traveler.
2,Not The Best,"Each phrase has a ""pronunciation"" after it. Very confusing and some aren't even correct. The book would come in handy if you visit Italy and already know some Italian...other than that, it's not for someone that doesn't know any Italian at all."
4,Easy Italian,Easy and laid out well to use and study Italian. The most popular frequent phrases we need to communicate are here for you. The phonetic help to speak the language is included.
1,boredddddd,it just wasn't for me. i couldn't bring myself to look at it more than once. im sure in a more scholarly situation it would suit better.
3,okay reading,Not to impressed with book. Seemed very full and boring. I feel I wasted my time when I read this book.
2,MONEY WILL CHANGE YOU,"THIS MOVIE IS BASED ON THREE BROTHERS AND A LONG TIME GOOD FRIEND.dRUGS PLAY A BIG PART IN THIS MOVIE,SINCE THE MAIN ACTOR WANT TO DO WHATS RIGHT, BUT WHEN HIS WEED SMOKING BROTHER THROWS A PARTY ALL OF THIS DREAMS COME CRASHING DOWN...IF ONLY THIS MOVIE WASN'T EDITED.(THEY DONT TELL YOU THIS WHEN YOU BUY IT)"
2,does NOT smell like mocha fudge,"i love the smell of both coffee and chocolate, but this incense doesn't smell like either or both. it does kinda smell a little like burned coffee, but no chocolate. i won't buy it again."
2,More like a heron.,This item is VERY much flimsier than the photo suggests and than some of the reviews indicated.
1,Rim is separating from bowl after 2 weeks.,"Have used this for 2 weeks (exactly 14 uses) and already the rim of the bowl is separating from the rest of the piece! It looked perfect and beautiful when it arrived. It has never hit the floor. We hand wash it and hand dry it directly after each use. I wanted this to be a toxin-free unbreakable dish for my toddler...and bought it as a test before buying a whole bunch of them...this type of quality is not going to work out. I'm saddened that I can't buy more and also really upset that it didn't last longer!!!!!!If you want a small, pretty bowl then go ahead but don't buy it if you plant to actually use it!"
5,Engineering the world,If you have ever worked at TI you know that it was and still is a special company. This book will remind you why you love the company. The history of the founding of the company reminded me how special the culture is. The willingness to take risk and tackle the impossible emerged from the early days in the oil exploration business and thankfully stayed with the company through the years. Buy this book!
5,Stash Envy: And Other Quilting Confessions And Adventures,"I was given Lisa's first book by a friend for my birthday. So, when I saw this one, I thought 4 of my quilting buddies might like to enjoy her writing. How right I was. They all loved it. In a world where ALL quilters tend to have ""stashes"", Stash Management and Fun Reading are a must. Great work, Lisa. Thank You Amazon for making it available to us."
4,"cute, funny, & a little outdoor education too","I am a little less than half way through the book. I've been reading it with my six and eight-year old children. They both like it. The illustrations are good and appear about every other page or every three pages. I like the fact that it cracks silly jokes, which the kids appreciate, but it also teaches about being out in the woods. I got online here to look for others in the series, but this just came out. A second book is listed as coming out soon, but shows that it is appropriate reading for ages 9-12. The recommendation for ages 4-8, for this first book, is appropriate."
3,Rigours of Time,"When I last read this novel in the 1960's I found it absolutely hilarious. This time, 50 years later, I merely found it sad and at times rather cruel. However, Kingsley Amis is a talented writer and cannot be ignored simply for being out of date in a social sense. I don't know if there are still such sad people involved in the academic world where Jim tries to make ""a go of it"". We must assume there are simply because the job description of an academic at that time, and maybe today as well, was to interest the young in things which hardly ever satisfied their creative inclinations! Jim is indeed lucky to find alternatives but, unlike my reading in the 1960's where I cheered him on, these days I cannot help feeling that he deserved none of it!"
3,neurotic intellectuals in a nerurotic world,"I enjoyed the clever satire of the absurdity of British academia where status and pretension can be valuable, and yet luck, both good and bad, can suddenly change everything. Very smart, but I just didn't feel the connection with the story personally."
3,Scandalously funny,"I read a very few novels or work of fiction. This one was recommended by a friend. Wonderful & enjoyable reading. I did not laugh out loud while reading this book but it made my mind very light. I thoroughly enjoyed the writing style, the plot, characters...everything was very well neat together."
2,Lucky Jim now very dated,"I bought this book as a nostalgia trip, having read it in my teens almost fifty years ago.It seems very dated now. Junior academics obsessed with sex and beer. Professors supporting their Victorian pretensions on the income of a wife of independent means. An improbable plot seems very puerile.Don't go there unless your nostalgic memories are more accurate than mine."
2,What's All the Fuss?,"kingsley Amis' established himself as a literary celebrity in England with the publication with this short work of comedy, which would continue to occupy a comfortable niche in the academic-farce 'genre' for the duration of the trend. Yet I found Lucky Jim terribly stiff and antiquated; it lacks any of the satirical wit that it must have possessed during time of its publication. We are asked to follow a fairly inept junior professor through a series of contrived situations at a major university amidst a cast of comic-book-esque academic types. I suspect that this brief whimsy will be an object of sociological curiosity rather than a highly regarded work of literature. Kingsley has the ability to reveal the absurdity of a given culture. He does not however, have the ability to make it pulsate with life and mystery the way his son can."
4,"Very well written, but...","Jim is lucky, primarily because everything comes together so well for him by the end of the book. And that's part of the problem with this classic. There's an unnecessarily implausible happy ending that didn't need to occur. Jim Dixon is the quintessential anti-hero. Gliding through life at the campus, trying to succeed by not truly trying. Skating through life; chasing the beautiful woman, Christine, partially due to the fact that it will annoy Christine's boyfriend, Bertrand; drinking too much at inappropriate occasions; being disrespectful to the department head, Mr. Welch, for no apparent reason other than he is Dixon's superior. All of these ingredients make for a very funny book, but do not reasonably add up to the book's conclusion, which in my mind was the book's only flaw. Amis's writing is terrific, however, allowing the reader to get deeper into the mind of Dixon than most other books' primary characters."
4,A liitle outdated now,"Okay, so saying it's a little outdated sounds a bit harsh. After all, classics like Lucky Jim never lose their appeal. But 1954 humour is different to today's humour, though passages of Lucky Jim will certainly cause more that a few guffaws. Also, the humour and style is dated English (and I don't mean Monty Python). You need to understand the English culture to understand some of the 'jokes'.Having said that, Lucky Jim remains a delight to read as it satirises the pretentious lives of the university professors and their pathetic wives. Amis's use of internal dialogue is truly remarkable, keeping us handsomely amused with the thoughts of the principle character, James Dixon, as he moves in turn through cynical, rude, crude, catty, nasty, incisive, indecisive, mocking, and always insecure. It is a work that achieves a rare combination of being a literary treasure and also a humorous novel. I can happily recommend it."
5,Witty Humor,"It's a good story for those sick of overdramatization without intelligenge. Some things get a little bit out of hand, but only the wittiest survive."
3,"Dated, comedic novel just doesn't stand the test of time.","Kingsley Amis's ""Lucky Jim"" must have been quite a shock to its readers when it came out, with its comedic situtations and its anti-culture, anti-academia message, but yet...it seems so dated looking at it today. You can see a youthful rebellion in the book, as Dixon is a utterly disinterested professor of history. He absolutely loathes his field, and anything considered ""haute couture"". He quotes books, but of course won't tell us where it's from. But Dixon isn't particularly likable, nor a great character, and the rest are two-dimensionional stereotypes(Bertram is the oaf, Christine the desirable girl, Margaret the witch, Dixon's boss a know-nothing stuffed shirt). Although, the thought of Amis having Dixon say ""Flithy Mozart"" is a work of genius, but that is the lone high point of the novel. Only merits 3 stars."
4,Still Funny But a Little Dated,"There are hilarious moments in this book, particularly when Amis describes protagonist Jim Dixon when drunk or hung over. Starting chapter six, Amis writes: ""A dusty thudding in his head made the scene before him beat like a pulse... His mouth had been used as a latrine by some small creature of the night, and then as its mausoleum. During the night, too, he'd somehow been on a secret cross-country run and then been expertly beaten up by secret police. He felt bad."" At the same time, the social assumptions of the character seemed dated, with Dixon, an assistant professor, wondering, for example, what responsibility he would acquire by kissing a young woman. Bottom line, the humor is timeless in this campus novel. But the book captures the social dynamics of your parents or grandparents-provided they were English."
1,The Penquin Class contains many serious errors,"Do not buy the Penguin version of Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis. It contains many errors introduced by the new publisher. One ofthe biggest occurs on p. 250. Four lines down is a paragraph where Jim is thinking of which suburb he should live in whenhe moves to London. In the 6th line down, he thinks to himself ""Belgrave Square, Wapping, Chelsea. No, not Chelsea.""The error is here and it is huge. The correct version should read: ""Belgrave Square, Wapping, Bloomsbury. No, not Bloomsbury.""What makes this error so huge is that Bloomsbury was the favorite enclave of London's writers. So, Jim is refusing to livewhere the writers live, and hence Amis, the author, through Jim's thinking, is taking a swipe at all the pretentious authorsin London. This is a very funny line for those keenly interested in Lucky Jim. It is also a bit of an in-joke. This is all destroyedby Penguin's version which uses Chelsea. There are many other errors, too. Don't buy this edition."
4,Like it,Collects a lot of dust. I check it weekly and vacuum the filter. Saves $$ if you don't mind the maintenance.
4,Glad I bought,This beats buying a disposable filter every month costwise. However it is not easy to clean. I use the hose outside but difficult to get all the dirt off even with jet stream.
4,web filter,"I have these for 6 or 7 years, I spray Enddust on the filter after I rinse it and it's dry, so it works a little better, it collects better than just a filter plain."
4,Good Washable Filter,"We haven't had the filter very long (about 2 months), but so far, so good. It is effective and easy enough to assemble and take apart to rinse monthly. We are big fans of the washable reusable filters vs. changing them with flimsy ones all the time! This was the only one that came in the size we needed."
3,Never see any dirt when cleaning,"I agree with the guy who says they don't seem to trap dirt. I've had 2 of these for a several years now, and when I clean them, I never see any dirt. They always appear clean. When I put in a paper filter, I see tons of dirt collected. So, I'm not sure these really work. It's weird."
5,"Sorry Arlo, I couldn't wait.","Alice's Restaruant has been a Thanksgiving Day tradition in my home now for years including the song. Arlo Guthrie has always been one of my favorite singer/songwriters. It would have been great to hear Arlo and the late Jim Croce (another outstanding artist)from the past jamming together on Jim's front porch. But, anyway this movie is about the life and times of Arlo. A must see film. Thank you Arlo Guthrie for telling your story to the world. My peace be with you!"
5,A classic,I Love Arlo. I Love this story. It's timeless and a classic. This has become a Thanksgiving Tradition of viewing in our house.
4,"A sixties Classic, FINALLY on DVD!","Arthur Penn did a great job of capturing the spirit of the late 60's in this film version of Arlo's classic Story/Song.One of the neatest things about this film is that it was filmed at the actual locations where the story took place! Officer Obie actually plays himself! It's also neat to see James Broderick, father of Matthew Broderick in this movie. He was a great actor!I love the story's Anti-War statement, as well as showing what hard drugs can do to you.The music is awesome, too of course!I am so glad to see this film on DVD!Thanks!"
1,Wrong region,Well I was really excited to see this up for sale and couldn't wait for it to arrive but in my fast pace of buying I overlooked that if I scrolled down the notice for what region the DVD was made for.I am rather disappointed that I overlooked that key and important thing even when I got it in the mail today I just tore into it and didn't notice 'till my DVD player told me the sad truth.A bit of of assumption on my side and not seeing it clear within the title has led me to this sad fate.
1,alice's restraunt,i was very un happy about the fact that i was sent a movie that i had to borrow a computor to watchit on. so as for the service getting it to me was great but as for the movie it really stunk and moviemars provided no soultion to the problem
2,I Don't Get It,"I saw this movie today on TCM. They say that making a movie is expensive and a lot of hard work. If that is true, then never was more effort expended to make a film about people loafing around and doing nothing.Was the movie a profile of a battered woman? (Alice)There is a scene where, during an argument, Alice is called the B word, and then slapped by a man. No one in the movie seems bothered by it, and a jolly and goofy wedding ensues. A major flaw in continuity maybe? Or maybe it's Art, but the point is lost on me.And Sneer, Sneer, Sneer. Arlo Guthrie Sneers at everything."
1,Ripped off,These jerks sold me a PAL DVD that cannot be played in the civilized world.WTF?I can't review something that I will never be able to watch unless I move to Uganda.
3,I did not remener it right,"I saw this film for the first time 24 years ago when I was a boy. I remembered it as a fantastic film. Now I have seen it again.There are no head and tail in the story. It starts fine, but it never leaves the start. However, it does have a few nice shots and surely the music is really good. So, the two stars are really for the music, and the one star is for the film."
1,Not worth the time it takes to watch it,"Along with millions of others, I loved ""Alice's Restaurant"" from the time I first heard it as a young man, and still laugh when I think about the concept or recall some of the lyrics. So, when I saw the DVD at a going out of business sale for $5, I scooped it up, hurried home, and put it in my player. Shelling out five dollars for it was my first mistake. Actually watching it was an even bigger mistake. What an incredible waste of time...Arlo's father, the great Woody Guthrie, would have been so embarrassed to know that anyone had actually viewed this trash; much less that his son had taken the time to take part in it. Can't rate minus stars, so I'll give it one."
3,I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT 4 BUT THE ACTING SUCKED.,"GREAT REVIEW OF LIFE IN THE 60'S. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE STONED TO ENJOY IT, BUT IT HELPS. EVERY GEN X-ER SHOULD SEE THIS. IT WILL HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHY THEIR PARENTS ARE SO SCREWED UP!!! GREAT FLICK. BUT THE T.V. SHOW WAS BETTER !!! MEL; KISS MY GRITS !"
1,NOT LIKE I THOUGHT,"Well it all started yesterday when my dad, my cousin, and I went to the local video rental store. My cousin was looking for a Led Zeplen movie. Well we got there and the road was all frozen from the snow so we had to be carful. We walked in, looked around didn't find the movie so we spotted ""Arlo Guthrie's Alive's Restaurant"". We thought since we all loved the song that we'd check it out. When we got to the house we were shocked. The movie was not like we expected. I would not recomend it if I worked at the store."
3,Question,"This isn't so much a review, but just a question - what's the deal with the ""Special R rated version"" advertised under ""Special features"" at the back of the dvd case? When I played the dvd, there was no special r rated version in the features menu. Is this some kind of joke? The irony really struck home when I listened to Arlo's commentary about the limited nature of the sex scenes - ""that's all you could show at that time"". Anyway, I would have bought the dvd regardless of the bogus extra feature. I wouldn't say its a great movie, but it does really capture the essence and atmosphere of the late sixties (even though Arlo manages to point out some of the inaccuracies of the director's presentation of the hippie life style). Also has some nice autumn scenery of Stockbridge, Mass. And an interesting jam session with Pete Seeger. All in all, a keeper."
3,not as i remembered,"this was not like i remembered it but funny story a little boring,. there really is not much more to say"
5,Happy,Although used the movie arrived quickly & in presteen condition. I was very happy; now I can watch it every Thanksgiving & be perfectly content.
4,Alice's restaurant,"An old movies that I saw way back in the late sixties and recently thought that I would like to see it again but had a lot of trouble getting it until a friend suggested I look on amazon......there it was.A good movie,certainly not a classic but a great memory from many years ago."
3,THE MARIAH/WESTLIFE VERSION SHOULD HAVE BEEN REMIXED,"Mariah's version is great. The version she did with Westlife is excellent. I could go on and on about how great their voices are together, but enough of that has been done by the other reviewers.But why are all the remixes ""Mariah only""? That's the problem with this single, and the only reason why I give it 3 stars. There are no remixes with Mariah and Westlife on this CD, and that would have been an extra incentive to purchase it."
2,"Hey, what's going on here?","Mariah, honey, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INNOCENT DECENT HIGH NOTE-HITTING BEAUTY QUEEN WE ONCE KNEW? I know you've had over a dozen #1 hit singles, but really, this collaboration with a boy group like Ireland's Westlife (on this Phil Collins cover) or 98 Degrees (on Thank God I've Found You), both of which appear on her Rainbow CD, is inexcusable for the 1999 album to get THE MOST reviews out of all her CDs, make her get into the MTV garbage my sister and so many teens in corporate America love so damn much, and similarly have the 1999 CD sell more than probably Daydream ever did. Which is why I'm down with my mother, my older brother, and everyone else who doesn't personally care for MTV or ""trash music"" at all. As for this single, I still prefer the original Phil version. This version loses its great meaning when sung by an otherwise great voice like Mariah's, and nothing special can be deciphered from it. Stick to the original version and to Mariah's earlier releases."
3,Toss Up,"I'm a fan of Mariah Carey, and I'm a HUGE fan of Westlife, but I can't say that this was the best for either of them. Mariah's getting old...Westlife is just starting out...it's a good collarboration to get them someplace, but to duet with Mariah Carey... This is a good song. I like it, but Mariah could pass this song on her own. She doesn't need to add a boy band, cause it's mostly her anyway. Get it if you're a die hard fan, but I wouldn't really recommend it."
2,not another....,"it's sad to see that mariah needs to enlist the help of boygroup Westlife to score her 2nd #1 UK hit...and her 1st was also a remake. what's worse, mariah is into her zillionth remake so-called hit. The orginal by Phil Collins is a classic, not so sure about this reworked version, and further more reworked a 2nd time. mariah is still as emtionally barren and westlife, they aint even singing... this is such a commercial attempt to revive mariah's falling star and to boost westlife's undeserving bright star!"
5,BEAUTIFUL COLLABORATION!,"MARIAH HAS DONE IT ONCE AGAIN. TEAMING UP WITH BOY BAND WESTLIFE TO DO ANOTHER VERSION OF PHIL COLLINS' AGAINST ALL ODDS. THIS SINGLE WILL BE INCLUDED ON HER SOUNDTRACK TO HER MOVIE ""ALL THAT GLITTERS"". WESTLIFE HELPS OUT ON THE TRACK TO ADD THAT BACKGROUND AND LEAD VOCAL ENCHANTMENT. HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BE MARIAH 16th #1."
1,Doesn't work with Windows XP Service pack 2!,"Do not buy this game if you have XP service pack 2 installed, It will not run, and the developer has no plans to fix it."
4,Steve Wynn 1990-2004,"""What I Did After My Band Broke Up"" is a compilation collecting some of the highlights of the eight albums (seriously underappreciated artist) Steve Wynn has recorded since The Dream Syndicate broke up in 1989. Wynn has come a long way from the neo-psychedelica of the Paisley Underground scene, experimenting over the years with shadings of Dylan, Lou Reed, and Neil Young before finally striking gold with the guitar-heavy garage rockish duel masterpieces""Here Come the Miracles"" in 2001 and ""Static Transmission"" 2003. Don't miss: ""Amphetamine,"" ""Sustain,"" ""Death Valley Rain,"" ""Crawling Misanthropic Blues."""
5,Vintage George Duke,"Some of the smoothest cuts George has ever recorded. After Dinner Drink is my personal favorite. Candlelight, wine and After Hours; serve very warm and very, very late."
4,Too smooth,"Mr. Duke is getting to smooth now. I prefer his earlier works like Is love enough, snapshot, illusions .."
3,Good book,I had seen this author mentioned by authors in several other western books so i decided to give him a try. It is a good early American history book that is well worth the read.
2,Interesting view of America during World War I,"Hero Kurt Dorn is the son of a German immigrant, which puts father and son at odds during the war. Most of the book is taken up with Dorn's fight against the I.W.W., a socialist labor force that's backed by German money. (A double whammy as the two things America hated most at this time was Germany AND socialists!) It's not until the last third or so of the book that Kurt goes off to war. Author Zane Grey, through his fictional character, is able to go off on a tangent about American women going ga-ga over a uniform and throwing themselves at men. (Like that's never happened before.) Once in the trenches of France, Dorn - who had been so anxious to go kill Germans - suddenly realizes the evils of war and the wrongness of wholesale slaughter. Not that that stops him from killing a few Germans anyway.Count how many times the word ""wheat"" is used in this book."
4,Long lasting,"I love Alien, however I find it hard to wear, it's like bathing in a cloud of vanilla pretty but obnoxiously heady. The gel is a great way to wear Alien without knocking anyone out. It becomes more subtle, simpler and close to the skin. Not to mention it wears for hours and it's portable. Great for travel."
4,"I purchased this on a humble, and everyone loved it @ the office!","I tried a lot of perfumes, like most women I'm looking for MY scent.This may be close and right up there in the top 5 group.When I first put it on one of the women in the office wanted to but it from me right away!! I kindly accepted the compliment and told her I would order it for her right away,she bugged me all week until it came!!What i love about it is the gel consistancy, I wish there where other scents I could try with the same gel by thierry.I also like that it last all day without being over bearing,great feminine smell and lingering."
2,"Immature, incohesive","I caught DJ Spooky while in DC last fall. The show was fairly entertaining, so I figured I'd give Riddim Warfare a try. In general I'm not huge fan of hip hop, but do listen to a fair amount of electronica, trip hop, ambient, etc. In general I feel this album falls short compared to European counterparts such as Tricky, although I'm not sure this a fair comparison. DJ Spooky is not as intelligent as he wants you think he his. Many of his ramblings make no sense to me what so ever. Plus there are just to many Atari samples. Seriously I think there should be a limit on the number of Space Invader samples per recording -- 2 or 3 sounds good. I believe Atari could make a case for claiming royalties from this album. I found this work pretty immature."
1,Disappointing,"This album is very weak compared to his earlier efforts. The music is simple and straightforward, and the rapping is poor."
4,it's the end of the world as we know it...,"What will music be after a nuclear holocaust? Probably like Riddim Warfare. It's a scary thought but at least it's strong. I'm tired of music that doesn't make me feel something. This album completely takes me over. It commands me to move, dance, gyrate, something as long as I'm mobile. It paints a powerful picture and I highly recomend it. I don't know to who, but I'll figure it out eventually"
1,I don't get what people see in this????????,"I don't get why people like this music, I only got the album because it was .25 cents. I thought I would give it a try, but it's just not for me, I don't even know how you can call some of the tracks on this album ""music,"" I would just call it sounds. The only track that I liked was ""It's nice not to lose your mind"" but the track is phased from one side of the speakers to the others so you can't even hear the beat so it sounded terrible. I don't mean to be close minded or sound like I am hating on this album but this is just my honest reaction to it. But, by all means if you are a person who enjoys this album, more power to you. Just not for me."
2,A turn table nightmare,"My friend was going to toss this CD but gave it to me. As the title suggests, something revolutionary was supposed to happen. Unfortunately, DJ Spooky's efforts are a mish-mosh of noise, tired AOL samples, video game music & wrecked techno."
2,Overexpirimentationalism,"I am largely disappointed with this album. Some of the reviews I have read hailed DJ Spooky's attempt to conjoin multpile genres with his expirimental style, but to me the result is an an incoherent bravado of noise. The only enjoyable tracks are those featuring guests such as Kool Kieth and Sir Menelik, but between Spooky's silly pseudo-intellectual music-science rationalizations and his overly filtered effects, it sounds less like music and more like someone having fun with a mixing board."
5,Good thing it's digital,"Otherwise I'd wear it out. Of the three Dj. Spooky Cd'sI have this is my favorite. It has the right amount of rappingand enough smooth beats to make it pleasant to listen to. The other stuff i've heard of his is harsh and disjoint enough that you really have to be engaged with it to enjoy it. An earlier posting expressed their disdain for cool keith. I actually think he enhances the album. I've never like anything he has produced himself, but his voice works well with this sound. It's sometimes cheesy to hear peeps with philosophy backgrounds appropriate scientific terms to sound futuristic, but when Cool Keith does it on this album, it actually works."
2,Will the real DJ Spooky stand up?,"Though I'm always looking for interesting, innovative electronic music, I have resisted DJ Spooky for a while. Mainly because what I heard from him prior to Riddim Warfare sounded like someone tuning their ham radio while practicing their bass down the hall from any microphones. But (his pompous theorizing aside) I wanted to like him. And I figured Riddim Warfare might be my window into his work. It was on a major label. Hell, he was even working with rappers. Well, unfortunately, Spooky's still a work in progress. Despite a few interesting tracks, Riddim Warfare is all over the place. It's drum n' bass, it's Brazilian music, it's underground rap, it's reggae, it's pompous theorizing! All of this with no strong unifiying purpose. And unfortunately, he still drops into that annoying ""illbient"" vaporousness. I'm all for artistic diversity. But until Spooky develops some consistency to his work, he will just seem like he's genre browsing."
4,Required for Bio class,"It was ok, not in the tip top condition the seller had described it in. I had to use it for bio class, it was fun to use it to answer all those multiple choice questions."
1,Another way to get students to pay more for their education.,"The PRS clicker contains all of the flaws of planned obsolescence. Tiny screen, horrible user interface, and limited capability. It is a crutch for teachers that can't get students to participate. A useless an unnecessary technology that inhibits real learning in the classroom through discussion and free thought."
3,No sense of urgency...,"To sum everything up...I have yet to use this product, but I ordered this a few days before it was needed in my class....I got my phone case that I ordered as well waaayyy before I received the remote. I ordered it at the end of a week, which seemed like more than enough time to get to me, and it came aobut a week and a half later. People dont order things of this nature to keep as collector's items, it was for school and receiving it late sort of made me irritable. Also in the summary, it said that it had never been used, well there were lots of marks on it, which didnt bother me because it was inexpensive, but it was false informtion. but for the price, you cant beat it, nor nag too much."
4,Student remote,Remote worked fine but box was destroyed when it arrived - assume post office but makes it not a good resell to share with other students when we are finished with it !
4,InterWrite PRS RF Personal Response System Student Remote,"Delivery was quick. There were no instructions included on how to use it, which would have been helpful."
3,InterWrite PRS RF,We needed to change the delivery address and the seller was very accomodating. Arrived quickly and in good condition.
1,Disappointment,"I was pretty excited to find a Morison book available for the Kindle, and downloaded the sample immediately. As best I can tell, the publisher merely scanned in a hardcover print, and this version appears to be straight pictures of the scans. You can't zoom the text, and the print is quite small. Pages also take significantly longer to load, as compared to ""regular"" Kindle ebooks."
3,Technical difficulties,"I would like this book better if there were not the tech problems. Someone tried to cram a lot of writting into a little Kindle space, thus causeing a number of difficulties. I would be glad for a rewrite."
5,A great book about the U.S. Submarines during WW2,"this book does not follow the movie by the same name. The book is by far better it shows the tense physical conditions that the submariners during ww2 in the U.S. endured.I just could not put the book down until I finished reading it. It captures the true atmosphere of war under the ocean, where you can only see the enemy though the telescope and hearthe pinging of the enemy's sonar. You can lose yourself in this book."
4,Submarine warfare long before Red October or Das Boot.,"First printed in 1955, (I read the 1963 edition), Run Silent, Run Deep is the model story of most submarine stories. Beach describes the harsh reality of submarine life, from the cold depths to the heat of combat with an all-knowing detail.If you ever wanted to read a naval book that was not a Mutiny or Treasure story, than try this book."
4,Submarine Warriors,"I first read Run Silent Run Deep when I was a college senior and a midshipman who had been selected to be interviewed by Admiral Rickover. It is more than a story, more than a novel to us. We went to classes in Submarine School in Groton, in buildings called Morton Hall and Cromwell Hall. Mush Morton was Ned Beach's CO on the Wahoo. Mush Morton had sailed out of the Submarine Base in Groton, and we saw pictures of him on the walls of the school. We read books like ""Run Silent Run Deep"" and ""Silent Victory"" in Submarine School and on the boats because we felt that we had to read them to somehow find the courage to make the kind of sacrifices in defense of the United States that Mush Morton had made in the South Pacific.When I read Run Silent Run Deep, I can remember standing watch on the bridge of an attack submarine, smell the diesel fuel, and hear the pings of active sonar on the hull. It doesn't get any more real than this."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this key tag knowing that $2.50 would probably not get me much. Not surprisingly, the keychain hole is too close to the top. The thin strip of plastic broke after 6 months of heavy use. However, I opted to buy 3 extra key tags to replace the first, knowing that I would have to replace it again in 6 months. I don't have a problem with that, as other higher quality key tags were significantly more expensive."
3,Not Terrific,"We had bathroom tags identical to this for a few years and they worked just fine until the connecting ring started giving out on them. I assumed it was just normal usage, so after we had more broken tags than workable ones, I ordered some more. The connecting rings on the new ones are giving out after just a few weeks. This really isn't great. I've had to modify all three tags now to make them useable, and needless to say, I won't be ordering more."
5,restroom key tag,"This tag is nice and big, so nobody leaves this behind in bathrooms and it is easy to find it."
2,Don't expect more of the same....,"I had loved Peter Mayle's ""A Year in Provence"" and ""Toujours Provence"". This how-to-spend-obnoxious-amounts-of-money guide is amusing and I enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek explanations of how costly it is to maintain a marriage and a mistress, the necessity of cashmere to keep warm and the importance of a folding hat. However, it isn't the same type or level of writing as that in Mayle's novels. If you're looking for another romp through the South of France, stick to the above novels or ""A Dog's Life"" which is the story of the year in Provence told from the dog's perspective."
4,Spending money is lots of fun with Peter Mayle,"If you're ever in one of those wacky movie situations where a super-rich relative gives you a couple million dollars that you have to spend in 30 days, buy this book. If you wouldn't mind just reading about that lifestyle, read this book.Peter Mayle leads the readers through the finer things in life, such as handmade shoes, truffles, and caviar.People that already like Peter Mayle's books will appreciate this one, although it doesn't have a lot to do with Provence."
3,Not Mayle's best,"Leaving his haunts in the South of France, Peter explores the tastes of the rich and famous. Custom shoes, shirts, suits, second homes, stretch limos and all. A good read but not his best!"
3,A fun treatise on the finer things in life!,"In his undying wit, Mayle shares with us some of his field research on the finer things in life. Although really geared toward the gentleman reader, it is enjoyable for women to read as well. You'll learn some interesting facts on caviar, truffles, cashmere, and cigars as well as pick up on the potential pitfalls of overindulgence and gluttony. A quick and enjoyable read for anyone who is curious about the life of luxury!"
2,"no substance, a very quick read","i borrowed this book from a local library and is very disappointed after reading it. this book is mostly big words and no substance. there is no detailed real life or even theoretical solution to any of the problems he proposed. for example, section 7.4 is captial allocation at Deutsche Bank, sounds very intriguing, but when I actaully went to page 160, author only used less them half page to sum up Deutsche's strategy as Captial and Liquidy, no substance or detail whatsoever.I finished this book in less than 3 hours and learned nothing except a few buzz words, and that is about it.The previous commenter gave this book 5 star. take that 5 star with a huge grain of salt."
3,Ghost Story for Preschoolers,"There is a certain cuteness factor to this and kids love ghosts, even non-scary ones, but the story is a bit long for 3-4 year olds and uneventful."
1,Big disappointment,This film is a complete waste of money. It is a film of four or five tourist spots in Paris. It lasts 18 minutes and costs $40.00.Don't waste your time or money.Jack Lavino
2,Too Many Typos,"Overall a good introduction to the Unix Operating System, but the typographical errors are unforgiveable. The command line orientation of Unix is cumbersome enough without mistyped examples. Potentially frustrating for first time users, this book is in dire need of revision."
3,CURSED BY CARELESS ERRORS,An otherwise concise introduction that is offset by an large number of careless editing errors.The novice UNIX user should be aware that a number of the text's practise examples contain sytax errors and omissions which will prevent the programs from running properly--it will exasperate you until you figure out the errors. THIS TEXT BOOK NEEDS A THOROUGH SCRUBBING BEFORE IT CAN BE CONSIDERED A LEGITIMATE COLLEGE TEXT BOOK
1,It was very hard for a beginer to understand.,"I read it for a Unix class in college and I thought not only was the book not put in a format that beginers would not be easily able to grasp, but there were alot of mistakes and editing errors. Some of the examples were wrong (for the ones that had examples)and some of the numbered lists were put in the wrong order. Also it jumps around alot. I think they could have put it together better. Such as the vi editor and the file management. Why not put the chapters that pertain to vi together and the same for file management. There was a small paragraph on file management at the end of a command chapter."
1,UNIX Unbounded: A Beginning Approach,"Frustrating and exhausting reading. If you want to decipher the author's poor English, inconsistencies, incomplete examples and incorrect examples, then have at it. Seems like an attempted translation into English. Totally worthless for technical training. Author's good intention to provide tutorial sessions failed miserably with typos and syntax errors. If your professor is using this so-called textbook: Buy Another Unix Textbook. You'll be better off. Waste of my time and $."
1,"Vague, unfocused and badly formatted.","I was required to purchase this book for my Intro to Unix class with my college; what a waste of time and money. If your college requires you to purchase this textbook, I feel sorry for you."
2,No page numbers for the kindle!,"This is the most expensive E-book that I have purchased. I needed it for an online college class, however the professor assigns home-work by page number, and because the author skips around so much my professor chooses chapters in a different order than they occur in the book. I have to send in an e-mail every week to ask what chapter we are covering. There are some cheap novels that I have with page numbers. How hard can it be to put them in this text book for goodness sake? I do not think I will be buying textbooks on my kindle again and would not recommend this one in particular to anyone else."
2,Too many typos,"Typos where they count the most, during console commands and examples! Lost a good amount of time in some chapters trying to decipher what the correct words or syntax should be. This is OK in a novel, but in a computer textbook, really? Honestly, there seems to be more effort put into the cover designs instead of proofing!"
3,Great for Water Polo Newbs,"My son recently joined a high school water polo club and has fallen madly in love with the sport. Since we live in a part of the country where water polo is a little known sport (almost anywhere east of California), I found myself lost at games.I was a little surprized when I received what amounted to a brochure and not a book or booklet. On the up side, it is lamentated (good for a water sport) and easy to take to games. I've shared it with other parents at games and they agree it is helpful to those of us who are water polo newbies. I did find a decrepancy in the meter lines. According to my son's coach, high school club water polo doesn't have to use the lines shown. Our league uses 2-meter, 5-meter and center lines.SportSpectator lists caps and balls as the only equipment required. I wish they had mentioned mouth guards as an optional equipment item. Water Polo is a full contact sport and blows to the mouth are very common."
3,"for the price, okay, sure.","the box was old. two of the dvds were obviously scratched because they skipped a few times throughout the movie. that is very annoying. but it was a cheap deal, so okay, i can live with it."
1,"Stupid, Stupider and Stupidest","This trilogy started off bad and just got worse. It is full of moronic humor and the character of Stiffler is the dumbest, most obnoxious and moronic character ever written and performed to that level by a very poor actor. But I guess every generation needs it Porky's so, have at it. Its got a few good laughs all of them sophomoric. The first one is the best of the three and worth watching. The second was kind of funny but no where near the first and the third one... why bother... really. You have seen it all in the first one."
1,Great movies if they played,"This product arrived very quickly and seemed to be in great condition. However, one of the three movies will only play half the way through before it locks up. There are deep scratches on the disc that more than likely cannot be buffed out. Therefore, I ordered this product from a different source."
5,American Pie 3 Movie Pack,I was very pleased to see this movie three pack become available. I really enjoy these movies and feel the actors are really funny.
2,"movies good, blue rays sux.","i like the movies but the blue rays, u cant puase them 2 long or they make u watch the fbi mumbo gumbo ALL OVER AGAIN!!!!! and u cant skip it."
4,good stuff,"the three movies are in mint condition, the case and everything with it is as well. overall the quality is awesome. the service was great, quick, and very affordable."
2,Digital Copy Warning!,"BE AWARE!!!! You are not able to download the digital copy! When you try, you will receive an error stating the code is only good in the UK and Ireland!!!! Would have been nice to know that before purchasing!!!"
3,"Great, but American Wedding was off...","I enjoyed seeing the movies in Blu-Ray.The first 2 movies were great.The 3rd movie (American Wedding) was the theatrical release. Horrible. Previously I had only seen the extended version of the third movie. This version is bad. While some may like the lack of some of the more ""questionable"" scenes, the theatrical version ruins this movie. Much of this version seemed to be cut and pasted. This version of the movie doesn't seem to flow very well at all and left much of my normal laughter out.After watching this I disposed of the ""3rd"" movie and just put my extended DVD version in the slot as I couldn't bare to watch the regular version.If this set included the extended release of the 3rd movie I would have easily given it 5 stars.Choose for yourself, but be aware. People used to the extended version of the 3rd movie will be disappointed."
4,This stuff is funny.....and what an AWESOME price!!!,"This is a bargain for 3 pretty good movies. The first two are quite equal in laughs, but the third just blew me away! This is most certainly geared toward the 16-35 or so age range. I don't know too many people in their 40's and over that really enjoyed these movies. They are full of raunch and NOT for young ears."
2,Rent It,"As with most sequels, each film gets worse. Thank god that #4 was not included in this set or it would get no stars."
2,NO ES EN ESPAÑOL,"En el detalle del producto dice:Product Details:Language: English, SpanishPERO LA REALIDAD ES OTRA, ya que el audio no esta en español para ninguna de las 3 peliculas, y solo la 1 y la 3 tienen los subtitulos en español, ya que ""American Pie 2"" NO TIENE NI AUDIO NI SUBTITULOS EN ESPAÑOL...GRACIAS POR ESPECIFICAR ""Language: English, Spanish""MUY MAL..."
5,American Pie Trilogy,I love the movies that's why I ordered the collection. Came in good time and in good condition.
3,read this book,"wonderful stop read it immediately stop I'm sure it's good, though I haven't actually read it myself stop"
3,Plano Tackle Box,"The box is roomy but the subdivisions are not very flexible. That is, the drawers are divided into fixed width compartments each having only one groove into which a partition may either be placed or not. If the lengths they chose are not compatible with the lengths of your items, then too bad.The box is constructed of a soft, rather flexible plastic, not the rigid fiberglass that was used in my box from the 90's (I think it was a Plano too). Anyway, I couldn't get the bottom drawer to open on this box. I sent Plano an email asking if there was a place where I could shave a little off or lubricate in order to make the bottom drawer work. THEY NEVER REPLIED. After fiddling with it for a month or two, I can now get the drawer to open and close. The box didn't cost much, and I *am* using it so maybe it's worth what it cost --- but you still want your stuff to work right.My recommendation is, if you have time, check boxes out in a brick and mortar store before you order one."
5,Perfect support!!,"Actually fits, very comfy and supportive!! So so glad I found it!! True to size if not a little roomy!!"
2,Too Big!,This is more like a 2XL in runs huge. I will never be able to wear it for any kind of support.
4,Fun Social Satire,"The book's writing makes it move along at an international pace. But its greatest strength is social satire. It is a commentary on globalization, and the corporatizing of everything, from war to terrorism to the publishing world. It's funny, but agenda funny. Radically, anti-corporate actually. Not for everyone, but if you're politically minded and can laugh about really horrible things, it's for you."
5,One of the Best,"The Futurist is by far one of the best books I have read in a long time. All at once Othmer successfully navigates a solid, fast-paced plot, a tongue in cheek flip-off to the world of advertising, tech, and silicon valley, and a poignant cultural summation of the current state of the union. All of that while walking an incredibly fine line between fiction and reality. So much so that you are left wondering how much is really fiction and how much is true. Oh yeah, and i don't think I have laughed out loud so hard in years as I did with this book. Othmer's turn of phrase is unequaled. ""That's the button, button man!"" (you'll see)."
4,insight into life of globalist shill,"Past patriotic Americans and Republicans were known for their devotion to the high tariff. Today's un-American conservatives pay the protagonist of The Futurist to go around and make people feel better about Outsourcing. In the end everybody makes a lot of money, but nobody really wins."
2,Big Disappointment,"I came into my reading of the THE FUTURIST expecting witty, biting satire, and an overall intelligent send-up of contemporary American Culture, politics, terrorism, media, and everything in between. What I got was a mildly interesting book that was short on wit and any original insight, full of clunky prose, repetitive scenes, a HEAVILY contrived plot, and overall, not very funny. Additionally, the book is already quite lean at 229 pages, and it still felt about sixty pages too long. It reads like a novella, or even a short story, that some editor advised the author to pad to attain novel length. I am a huge fan of Kurt Vonnegut, George Saunders, George Orwell, Haruki Murakami, and all the great satirists of our time. This book is a pretender to the throne. Be forwarned."
2,"Briefly inventive, but overall disappointing","This should have been a very good book. If you read the blurb, read the plot, or even try to summarize it afterwards, it comes out as a good book.But. The writing style is overly stylized and becomes taxing and dull about halfway through the book. The lack of character development and character insight is frustrating -- as Othmer adds more color and strangeness to his characters throughout the book, he makes them more superficial and unbelievable. And the storyline, such that it is, gets horrendously convoluted before leading everyone to the conclusion that they knew was coming all along."
2,Weak at best,"I picked up this book at the library after Borders and USA Today both recommended it. Honestly, I was very disappointed by it. The story goes no where, the characters are one dimensional and as a satire, it needed some MAJOR work. If you want to read good satire, you're better off reading Orwell or Palahniuk."
1,Worst Book I Ever Read,"Intriguing, for the first twenty pages. Alright about half-way through. Then it's like Othmer put the manuscript in a drawer for a year while he went through rehab, found god, and finally came to terms with this hatred for his father.Not recommended"
2,Am I the only one who didn't like it?,"At first glance, this was a book that should have been right up my alley. A guy gets sick of the BS he gets paid to feed corporate gatherings, and turns on them. As a result, he seems to be more popular than ever. He's a geek, always encouraging companies to take the next step forward in propelling the bleeding edge.But frankly, the guy just wasn't likeable. He comes off as a smartass who spouts off one-liners and bull like it was nothing, but has no redeeming qualities that make you want to root for him. While much of the book was entertaining enough to keep me reading it, I wasn't satisfied with the plot (and the inevitably predictable ""twist"" revelation of the mysterious Nostradamus' identity) enough to really recommend it."
5,Great Title Song,"Particularly enjoyable was the title song, ""Some Things I Know."" The melody is simple and flowing, the lyrics touching. You can walk away humming this one!"
5,this is her best effort to date!!!,"Some things I know, this is pure class! My fiancee and I are playing this song at our wedding!"
2,I would pass,"I have a few of the original Russel Wright pinch spoons. I love the shape and feel of the spoon. Well, this new set does NOT have the same shape. For the life of me I can't understand why they would reintroduce a line, but make it different. I don't mind that it is shiny, the price is right, quality is fine, but it is not the same shape as the original. Buy this set if you need flatware and like the design. Do NOT buy this set if you want the same shapes as the original. And I was so hopeful!"
1,Misunderstanding Dispensationalism,"I would ask any potential reader to consider whether a covenant theologian is the most reliable source of information if he wants to understand dispensationalism. That would be like trying to understand a conservative political philosophy by reading The Huffington Post! I have nothing against Poythress as a person and I'm not questioning his piety but let's understand his agenda - and there is one. If you want to understand covenant theolpgy read the works of covenant theologians. If you want to understand dispensationalism read ""Dispensationalism"" by Charles Ryrie or ""Has the Church Replaced Israel"" by Michael J. Vlach."
4,Great Series,"I watched this series over my friends house and been addicted since, so glad it went on sale. Now just to buy the rest on blu ray."
4,Supernatural is Super,If you want to watch Supernatural then you need to buy the DVD Seasons. The reason is that the Music on the pay per ep is not the same as the orignal. Example. On the Season 1 Finale on the DVD we here a Great song from the Group Kansas. Waywod Son. On pay per ep it is some other song and not nearly as good. But. The Show Supernatural has it all. Great Family Drama and Great Music and Great Action and Fx and all kinds of Monsters and Demons and even The Devil himself. This is one Series that will make you keep a light on during the night and make you hope that that same light does not flicker. For if it does. Then you have trouble.
4,A good fix for Whedon-heads,"I don't think this is the best speculative fiction show on, but it shows glimpses of what it can be given enough time. Hopefully, the WB will stick with it longer than its elder bretheren would (ABC - Already Been Cancelled; NBC - Now Being Cancelled; CBS - Cancelled Before Scheduled; and Fox - which is a near rhyme for...well, you can figure it out. The chemistry between the two leads is good, and the mythology that many of the ex-X-File-ites are creating could have a long life as the characters dig deeper. Besides dad, though, I think we need to see more recurring characters. Surely these three aren't the only hunters out there, so start showing us the bigger picture and stop killing off all the allies. Don't get me wrong, I'm addicted, but the show has potential that's not really showing up yet."
5,Super happy,"love this show,so got them from my boyfriend as an early Xmas gift, the DVDs came, exactly what I wanted, great condition, arrived on time, no issues at all. Very good product."
4,Decent show,"Good production qualities and effects. Story lines and dialog are good. Love the occasional jest towards other characters and shows in the sci-fi genre. I like that it's intense at times, but usually cuts out before it goes into unnecessary graphic detail."
5,WOW!,"For any Supernatural, Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki and Jeffrey Morgan out there - this is awesome! I loved the bonus features with the gag reels and special link to the interative site. Awesome dvd!"
2,Wooden acting,"Like so many modern TV shows, they feature actors with the right ""look"", but no acting ability. Put actors such as these into a story line with nothing really to do and you have a waste of 45 minutes."
3,Customer Service,"I purchased a set of DVD's for the first season of Supernatural as a gift for Christmas. When the DVD's were played, #2 (out of 6) played for about 10 minutes and then quit. There is a huge scratch on the back of it. I purchased the 'new' set instead of a used set. According to Amazon's return policy, since the plastic wrap is removed, then I can only get half of the return price. I searched the website and it stated that if you had any problems, then call the customer service number. I looked all over and could not find the number. I understand they are trying to protect themselves from people copying DVDs and then returning them. However, their policy screws the folks that actually have a faulty product. I will try looking for the number 1 more time. I would recommend to anyone wanting to buy a set of DVDs to buy them from a local supplier that would give easier and better 'recourse' for solutions to problems."
2,5 stars! Are you kidding me?,"Bought the DVD set of Season 1 and I stopped watching after about 5 episodes. The writing is mediocre, the acting performed by cardboard cutouts and the story lines are just not that interesting. Spend your money on something worthwhile."
4,"Good show, good dvd","Supernatural is a very good show, and the dvd of the show are perfect. I'm Spanish, and here we don't have this show on dvd, I bought this show some days ago here, in Amazon. The dvd's have a very good presentation, with the digipack, here we don't have this things, here only slim case or a new plastic boxes."
5,GREAT SHOW!!!!!!,SUPERNATURAL IS ONE OF THE BEST NEW SHOWS ON TELEVISION.IT IS SCARY AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO BROTHERS IS VERY HEARTWARMING.JENSEN ACKLES AND JARED PADELECKI DO A GREAT JOB AND HAVE GREAT CHEMISTRY. THEY ARE ALSO GREAT LOOKING WHICH DOES NOT HURT.ALSO JEFFREY DEAN MORGAN (WHO ALSO PLAYS THE WONDERFUL DENNY ON GREY'S ANATOMY) IS HEARTBREAKING AS THE BOY'S FATHER. HE IS A VERY GIFTED ACTOR AND DOES A GREAT JOB.I AM SO GLAD IT IS COMING TO DVD. EVERYONE CHECK IT OUT.
5,Supernatural DVD/1st season,I love this show. This is a great collection. The extras are the best part.
4,supernatural-complete first season,Supernatural - The Complete First SeasonVERY EXCITING SERIES AND VERY GOOD ACTING BY JENSEN ACKLES AND JARED PADALECKI. THE BROTHERS TEAM MAKE FOR A VERY SATISFYING SHOW. IF YOU HAVE SEEN IT GET THE BOXSETS. TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT NOW AND LOVE IT LATER.
4,Spoooky,Supernatural is great in bringing back the legends of the early horror films in a whole new light and for the younger generation.
5,Supernatural: The complete first season,My grandson was so happy to receive the dvd: Supernatural: the complete first season. Very nicely packed. In perfect condition. Amazon was the only place I could find this item.
5,Sam and Dean- Two Complete Badasses,"I was somewhat skeptical about this show before I started watching it. I assumed it was going to be some horrible horror show with no plot line. Man, was I wrong. This is now one of my favorite shows! I was so hooked after picking this up at Wal-Mart on Black Friday that as soon as I finished Season one I had to go out and buy Seasons 2 and 3! Then after finishing those I immediately bought seasons 4 and 5. This series is just that good where you'll be hooked until you're caught up. In fact, I'm currently caught up to where it's at on Season 6, and I almost wish I wouldn't have watched them so fast, because it's hard to wait for a new episode! This series has a perfect balance of horror, drama, suspense, comedy and action to keep you wanting more. I would go into specifics but I don't want to write any spoilers so as to ruin it. Hopefully this review was somewhat helpful. Thanks for reading and go buy Season 1 of Supernatural NOW!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Bait and Switch,The price of season two was bumped up 3 times. I will by DVD for now on. Supernatural was great. Amazon Instant Video failed.
5,loved it yes,came right away safely shipped and the item was just as it was posted would order again from same place
4,supernatural,it was alright when it arrived the product plays great but the packaging was a little damaged and disc five always falls out of the slot
4,supernatural season1,I have never seen the First seasons and wanted to see how it all began. Watched with my eldest daughter and son-in-law. We all like supernatural.
5,Supernatural DVD's,The set of DVD's arrived in a reasonable amount of time and were properly packaged. The price offered by Amazon was incredibly less than prices I found in other retail stores and online. My daughter was very happy to receive this purchase.
2,Please enter a title for your review,"The uniformly shadowy lighting which is exactly the same in every shot whether it's day or night is annoying and contrived, while the casting and wardrobe choices for the chiseled-jaw catalog model looking brothers and the plot device of having them hunting down a demon that killed their mother seems to serve the exact opposite purpose to the dark lighting, making paranormal subject matter relevent to family values and more palatable to conservative middle america. The individual episode plots aren't necessarily badly written but the show couldn't be more insipidly conservative and dull if it tried."
1,"Dull, poorly written, formulaic...","Probably, something is wrong with me. I was hooked by the reviews and, since I have the ability to suspend belief, was excited by the prospect of becoming engaged with this one. But I found nothing of value here. Poor writing. Cheesey acting. Complete formula stuff. No depth or complexity in the plotting or the characters. Completely idiotic moments.Now, I could only watch 4 episodes, so maybe it improves.Not one piece of corn in this dung heap. My wife thought it was worse than I did.If I could have rated it lower than 1 I would have."
1,Teeny bopper show,"I bought season 1 when it came out and i thought it will be good. To my my surprise, it was not. It was only 1 episode named ""Asylum"" of the 22 episodes.I gave up watching this teeny bopper show after watching all the 21 poor episodes, which i think lacked, suspense, good story, acting and so on. If more episodes was like Asylum, i think it would've been better.I will not see a episode of this show anymore. I heard this show was influenced by The X-Files. I only thing that alike was them going around solving crimes and helping people. I think this show deserves my rating 1 out 5."
1,"a waste of time, save ur money","I'm glad that i had the chance to see a few episodes of this show on tv first otherwise i might have baught the season box and would have wasted good money for it.It's a simple story line, with bad dialogues, and no imagination in it what so ever. The only good thing about this show is that there r a few nice looking guys and girls in it which is about all i can say about it.So save ur money, and even more important, ur time. A rerun of an x-file or buffy episode is a better use of ur time."
5,Compelling and entertaining!,"Hooked from the first moment. It's scary, suspenseful and funny. You might learn something too..."
5,Sensational show,"Not since Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, have I enjoyed a show so much. The characters are wonderfully played by Jared and Jensen. In fact, the entire cast is top notch. The episodes are well-written, funny, witty, and scary. Season 2 has only gotten better. I can't wait to see what happens next!"
5,My favorite show,"I love this series. It's when my daughter and I sit down and watch tv together. It's funny and creepy at the same time. Sam and Dean make us laugh with every episode! It's different form the same ole same ole out there. Season one builds up all the back story you need to fully enjoy the later seasons. It starts out after two years, Sam Winchester is suddenly visited by his big brother Dean, who insists he helps look for their father John who disappeared on his latest 'hunt' for poltergeists. We never miss a show!"
5,Amazing,"One of the most amazing series I've ever viewed.Every episode is like watching a short monster movie.The special effects and acting are top-notch.I highly recommend this series for anyone who is into fantasy, scifi, or horror genres."
5,I'm so psyched this is coming to DVD,"With the merge with the WB, I wasnt sure if it was going to get picked up. Well thank the lord it did! I love this show, been hooked since the first 5 minutes! It's awesome, the cast is great and looking forward to many more seasons to come!"
5,The Best Show on Television,"I INSTANTLY became addicted to this show last year. The characters are so in depth and real. The way the brothers interact with each other is so incredibly believable and really makes the show what it is. As far as the ghouls on the show go, it's spectacular. The research that must have gone it to writing this show...you have to give the writers credit. I look forward to the start of the next season!"
5,The early seasons were the best,"I love this show, however I must say that the early seasons are the best, now the storyline is a bit muddled and it seems like the show is just going on because it has such a large fan base. I LOVED the first few seasons though so I have bought them on blu ray."
5,Beloved Series Anytime You Want It,"We are talking the first season of one of the best shows TNT has every put out there. Supernatural is a complete show from start to finish with dynamic characters, enjoyable plot, and fun action/sci-fi sequences. Sure you can find this show online, on Netflix, or whatever other TV/movie source you use, but there is nothing better than owning the discs themselves and being able to kick it up on the couch and rock out to one of the best shows out there. Plus, the next season is starting up soon so there is no time to waste when talking about getting caught up!"
4,"Supernatural, Season 1","I really enjoyed the first season of Supernatural, two brothers looking for their father after he disappears during a hunt (the bond between the father, John Winchester, and the two sons, Dean and Sam, is that they hunt down any supernatural being that they find killing people, and attempt to kill it). The series starts out with Sam as an infant and Dean about two years old and their mother is killed in the nursery by a demon in front of the father. I find the premise of every episode very interesting with the fact that the brothers never know what they are actually going after and usually have to make up solutions on the fly while still bickering like two brothers would.My only reservation about the disk set is the quality. There are some episodes that causes my DVD to slow up and stop altogether. Hopefully I just got a fluke copy so everybody else can enjoy this well thought out and exciting series."
4,Great show,This season is starts off one of the best tv series for the CW. The main story line for all seasons starts here and going back to watch it all over again it keeps to the main theme. However the music for this entire season sucks compared to the latter ones. I don't know what they were thinking with the choices but otherwise the acting and the story are great enough and even if the music doesn't compliment the moment. Maybe the dvd set will contain the original music like the other reviewer said.
5,Supernatural T.V. Show,The hit show Supernatural is worth it's weight in gold for the small price you will pay for the first season.In my opinion once you start watching each episode it sort of becomes like Lay's potato chips;but this time you can't watch just one!
5,The best show on TV,"I am from England and had not really been very interested in this show when I first heard about it. I saw the adverts and didn't think it was anything special. However, I was bored and tuned in to the pilot episode only to become totally hooked. I have not missed an episode since.I love the dynamic between the two brothers and it is that that keeps me watching. Both Jensen Ackles (Dean) and Jared Padalecki (Sam) just are the characters.I recently purchased the Region One DVD, simply because I was fed up with the fact that over here we had no special features. I was very impressed with the prompt delivery. It arrived a week before the earliest delivery date! The special features were definately worth the wait. I look forward to seeing the second series when it starts over here."
5,This is the best show on television,Supernatural is a great show and I am so excited that it is coming out with another season. This show is interesting and innovative every week and there is never a dull moment. Jensen and Jared really seem like brothers due to their undeniable chemistry together. This show has the right formula to keep people of all ages entertained every week. I can't wait until this season 1 dvd comes out...in fact i wish it were coming out sooner. Definetly the best show on television. I have loved it since the first episode aired.
5,A Well-Crafted and Entertaining Show.,"For those like me with little time to watch television and no money for Tivo, buying this DVD set was a godsend. Playing catch-up with Supernatural Season One was well worth it. This show is remarkable. The writing, acting and directing are all superb and well crafted. Each episode is connected, vibrant and genuinely fun to watch. Any fan of horror, sci-fi, comedy, or just good entertainment will get their money's worth."
3,Supernatural First Season DVDs,"I received the DVDs in great time. However, the second dvd doesn't work. We tried cleaning the dvd and it still didn't help. Other than that these were exactly what I was looking for my husband for Christmas."
5,Night Stalker update,"If you liked the old Night Stalker shows you'll love ""Supernatural"" with its better music and less whining, not to mention the brothers are much better looking. It can run a tiny bit preachy (mostly in the second season) but if you're fighting evil I guess its' easy to get preachy. All and all, entertaining and great eye and ear candy."
4,Great stories - fun show!,"I really enjoy this different take on all the urban legends / ghost stories, etc. I feel that the show really draws you in with both the characters, Sam and Dean, and the plot lines. I have been scared more than once! I hope to see Supernatural continue as there are many more ghost stories they haven't gotten to!"
5,love this show...,My daughters and I are all hooked on this show. Just creepy enough without being too scary. The actors do a really good job.
4,cool series,"I love this series so I had to buy the set. I recently purchased the 3rd season due out in september, and Im looking forward to it."
5,Surprisingly enjoyable,"Whilst not up to X-Files standards, Supernatural is a deeply enjoyable show. The two leads enjoy real chemistry, the scripts are both genuinely eerie and amusing, and the camera work can be excellent. A real surprise."
5,I really enjoy this show!!,I started watching a few episodes at the end of season 2. Then I watched season 3 and had too many questions. So I bought the first 2 seasons and found this to be a great show!!
5,Supernatural Complete First Season,"This is a Great tv series its definatly worth buying i loved it from the first time i saw it on tv, the dvd itself is amazing there are many special features which are really funny especially the bloopers. Im so glad i bought it, i actually live in England and i decided to buy it from USA because it is so much better than the Uk dvd there is no special features at all on the Uk version, so for me it was a great buy i cant stop watching it. The Actors Jared Padalecki and Jenson Ackles are both very talented and have great chemistry this makes the show even better. I cant wait for Season 2 to be relised on dvd.Great Job Guys, keep up the amazing work !!! Bring on the next season !!!"
5,MUST SEE TV!!!!,"Since the Pilot episode until Devil's Trap I have been hooked. Dean (Jensen Ackles) is HOT!!!!! The show has the right amount of thrills, chills, and laughs. I always watch it with the lights off. This show is AWESOME and I can't wait for Season 2 to start and Season 1 to come out on DVD. The music that they play ""ROCKS""!! I have gotten many family members and friends hooked on this show and I hope that you will get hooked too, because this is THE BEST SHOW ON TV!!!P.S. I LOVE the 67 Chevy Impala, it fits Dean's personality!!"
5,One of the better shows on television.,"Follow the tale of two men (Sam and Dean Winchester) out on the search for their missing father. The story starts in 1983 when ""The Demon"" that took their mother. Fast forward into today where Sam is in college and Dean is in the family business of demon hunting. The boys father disappears and so begins the quest of finding him.Many of the stories are based off of legends and folklore such as the hookman, wendigo, and reapers. Being into ghost stories, myths and legends, this show was really up my alley. There's comedy, action, and drama. The stories are well played out and Jensen Ackles and Jared Palidecki are great actors.I would recommend this series to anyone that loves a good ghost story, or just a great story in general."
2,NMR of Inorganic and Small Organic Substances,"This title has an excellent overview of the fundamental physical principles of NMR with many of the formulae and facts essential for understanding this topic at an introductory level. However, the applications section of this title is out of date. The book maybe useful for the organic and inorganic chemist interested in structure determination research. It is not aimed for the biomedical scientist interested in protein and enzyme or whole tissue analysis. References are adequately listed."
1,Some plays just should not be turned into films,"Some of David Mamet's plays turn out awesome on screen: ""Sexual Perversity in Chicago,"" ""Glengary, Glenross"". Others, like ""Oleanna"" and ""American Buffalo"" just drag on. This probably is a great play to see live in a more intimate setting but on screen it is just painful to watch.These are some of my favorite actors, and they have their moments. Dennis Franz goes on a couple of good rants, like when he realizes he got ripped off. But overall this is just too freaking dull. Pick another film."
3,American Buffalo,"Although Dennis Franz and Dustin Hoffman are, in my opinion, great actors, the plot to this movie was a real piece of garbage, and I don't think Franz and Hoffman should ever have agreed to participating in it."
5,American Buffalo,"Saw this on t.v. a while back. Had to have a copy. I like the fact that it's like a play and doesn't include a lot of scene changes and characters. In fact, you'll notice you hardly ever see anyone on the street when they're filming outside. There are actually ""3"" characters. BUT, even with so few characters it was one of those films I had to watch again to really follow the scheme that was going on. Since ordering my own copy I've watched it over and over again. It's interesting to read behind Dustin Hoffman's eyes and see the con man he is. He knows when to push buttons and when to pull back. Interesting movie. Recommend everyone giving it a watch."
3,"Great sound, horrible comfort","I was extremely impressed with the sound quality of this product. It works great, makes it easy for people to hear me, and me to hear others. Sadly, the headset was just extremely uncomfortable. I've used the SE HBH-30 and Jabra 250, both of which feel great. this one was painful after wearing it for about 10 min."
2,"Good battery life, bad ear piece","Having such long standby and talk times are nice, but it doesn't make up for the low comfort. Thank goodness it comes with two ear pieces as one broke when I tried to put it on the device. Perhaps the company knew this and put two in for that very reason. The device is so large that the poorly designed ear piece does not hold it to your ear well."
3,Wes's music is Oingo Boingo with a strong twist of talent.,"It's playful. Instrumentally, Wes himself is lyrical. His perky songs are his forte. I think the slow songs aren't the CD's strong point, (the lyrics can be trite at times) but there is a definite freshness in his music. He also needs a ""hot"" webpage. I think it would catch on fast with a younger market and solidify his popularity. (His instrumental talent will win people to his... music, and give him flexibility in the future.) -My suggestion is a web page with Wes in his t-shirt and boxer shorts with the capability to dress him in three different outfits showing his versatility as an artist and his playfulness as a new pop star. Add a few different scenerios.(e.g. driving an old car, hangin' out in Mexico, sitting on a porch, ?) - Sound strange in the middle of a review? Take it or leave it. Either way - Good luck Wes!! rkp@TimeInc."
4,Great stuff,"I was going to buy some empty jewel cases from my local used record store and they had a bunch of unsold CDs out in the sidewalk for the taking. I scooped up about 15. Got home, this one was on top. I thought- ""What if it's actually GOOD? Yeah- right! Ha!"" So I put it in the CD player. Wow! I had heard And So It Goes in the past w/o knowing the artist. The rest of the CD is a total grab bag of pop styles- very well done. It's bloody great!"
2,Okay but not great,"After multiple valiant attempts over four months, my son never took to this product at all. He was so preoccupied with trying to figure out the handles, he never would focus on trying to drink. May work for some, but if you have a very smart, inquisitive child who is early explorative stage, don't bother. My son picked up at six months the other children had a different cup and refused this one, which is why I decided to give Nuby a try. Nuby is a far superior product and a great deal cheaper.Nuby No-spill Sippy Gripper Cup 10 Oz. -Colors May Vary"
3,Quality Sheets But Need To Wash Them Well,"I purchased these sheets based on previous customer reviews and comparisons with other silk/satin sheets. These sheets are a high quality material, very washable and soft to the touch. They are not silk, just silky to the touch and only on one side. If I knew then what I know now I would not make another purchase of this product mainly because the material sheds fibers more so than one would like. After 3 washes I was able to start breathing in fresh air again, while sleeping, rather than the fibers of these sheets. Cotton sheets would be more comfortable or else pure silk sheets for a true silk sheet feel."
1,Forget these and buy Scent-Sation Whispersilk,"While this product seems similar to Scent-Sation Whispersilk, it's NOT. I have used Whispersilk for years and they held up beautifully. The ""Satin Alternative"" pilled within the first month. Additionally, the stitching and labels were sewn on the the soft side so as to imply that they are to be used on the flat side."
1,low quality,"I was very disappointed in the quality of these sheets. The fabric is sub standard, thin, pilled to the point of absurdity after 5 washes and should not be called satin. the construction of the sheets, i.e. where the corners were sewn together was terrible. I understand that these sheets are supposed to be reversible, but that is no excuse for having all of the stitching exposed. I cannot believe that I paid around $100 for this sheet set. do yourself a favor and do not buy them."
4,Good (but not great) quality,"I purchased the twin sheet set in the color 'Rose' about a year ago when they were on sale (paid around $30 I believe). Overall I am pleased with them and they are reasonable quality for what I paid. However, I do second some of the complaints of other reviewers:CONS:- The pillowcase does tend to give off lint after a few washings.- The hem stitches are visible on the satin side of the sheet and pillowcase, which looks sort of 'cheap'. It would have been better to design the sheets so that the stitches were visible on the cotton side. I mean, why bother buying satin alternative sheets if you are going to use the cotton side?- Cotton side is not really softPROS:- Fairly good quality and thickness; satin side is soft- Sheets have held up well despite multiple washings and dryings on the hottest cycle- They look nice (minus the visible hem on the satin side!)Bottom line, I would purchase these sheets again, but not for more than $30."
1,Very disappointing,"At first, I was delighted to receive these sheets. They weren't quite as heavy as I thought they would be, but they were smooth and comfortable. A good buy, I thought. BUT WITHIN 2 WEEKS, the sheets began to pill - especially at places where you move at night - at the head and under the legs. We have had these sheets only a month and they are so pilly that they are no longer usable. For the price ($79.00), I expected much better. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM."
2,Poorly sewn,"Frankly, I buy satin sheets for one reason only. My husband has Parkinsons disease, and satin sheets allow him to move in bed more easily. These slide as well as others.That said, some of the seams were sewn inside and others were sewn outside. I consider these seconds. Definitely not quality items."
4,great for summer,"we like it I got it for 28 dollars(full size),I want to buy more but they increase the price."
5,An Underrated Film,THE JAMES DEAN STORY is a powerful movie. It is an intimate story of Dean told in the simplest of images and wonderful narration. A simple homage to an American icon who's effects of his brief time here still linger.
2,Deceptive,"My 4th-grade daughter, who tends to get B's in reading, selected this book because the cover made it look inviting to someone of her age. However, she found the vocabulary difficult and distracting. I inspected it, and had to agree. Don't put a cute fuzzy animal on the cover of a book with a vocabulary meant for junior high."
3,i like knapsack,"accused of sounding the same in the past, i think this album tries to rectify that problem. however u shouldn't change what is already great, as day three of my new life certainly was. ironically the best tracks on this album are the ones most similar to the previous album. songs like ""please shut off the lights"", ""katherine the great"", and ""cold enough to break."". if u are a knapsack fan then buy this album. if ur just a fan of the genre then bye day three of my new life."

2,Overall Not very helpful...,"The first chapter is a GREAT, reassuring 30 minute ""Do you understand English?"", ""Do you understand English"" lesson. I could really speak these helpful phrases after 2 morning commutes. The rest of the chapters are about 3 minutes in length and just go way to fast to understand anything. They are also random situations such as ""I have a stomach ache"".From other reviews I read, the $35 or $45 (amazon priced) Pimsleur versions have more of the terrific 30 minute lessons.Although all is not lost, the box does include a helpful phrase card and small booklet of the random conversations on the CD.In my opinion, this just gives you 1, 30 minute audio chapter in hopes you'll buy the larger one. Just save the $10-12 on this and buy the other."
4,Great down and dirty to get by,"If you need a quick primer on Japanese for a short jaunt to Japan to get some work done, this CD will adquately teach you enough about pronunciation to get you by - along with an English to Japanese travel book. With about 20 words under your belt and the resouce to find an pronounce the word you need (when you need it)- you will survive. When I got sick in Japan it was worth a million to be able to say ""I have a cough"" and then pay 2,500 yen for 8 sudafed!Don't rely on one resource alone - you will be disappointed."
5,"Insightful, Inspirational","I read a lot of books on religion and faith, and most leave me without much to chew on.This book is quite different.You might not think celebrities would have much to say of interest about faith.But these interviews drew me in. Even celebrities I could care less about say something thought provoking.Maybe it's the author's choice of subjects, or more likely it's her interviewing skills, but this is a must read for people on a journey of faith."
5,"A wonderfull, mind catching, creative creation!","V.C. Andrews was an extraordinary author. Although many of her writings are slightly alike in subject, this novel was truly fantastic. It captures the mind and the heart as you become Audrina and are dying to find out what your twisted, terrible memories are. Throughout this book, I cried, rejoiced, felt fear and shock. V.C. Andrews is not just an author but a superb artist. It takes great imagination and creativity to come up with such wonderful stories. By far, My Sweet Audrina has got to be one of the best books I have ever read! Aliza Luf"
5,pressures of a child growing up in the shadows of the dead,The book was really good I read it in like half a day. I have read almost all of her books. My favorite series is the Casteel series. I just started the Logan series and I am half way threw the orphan series. She wrote very good books and I really wish that she was still alive to write her own books instead of her ghost writer.
5,Thrilling,This book was great! I hope everyone will read this book. It was the first and only book I've read by the actual V.C. Andrews. She was very talented and skilled. I have all of her books and I love the way their all in a girls point of view.
5,Best book so far,The book is so fantasic. Each person in the story is thought out. My favorite part was the chapter called The secret of the wind chimes. I would tell anyone to read this book. With anger and hate V.C. Andrews has certainly done some of her best work with this book.
