3,I don't know...,"I am neutral on this product. I hope it works. I bought the 10-year battery from Amazon although it comes with a battery and I tested it. I won't know if it works until I actually have carbon monoxide enter my house. I hope that doesn't happen, but according to the test button its up and running."
5,"Norman great, Battle good","This is a great disc. There is a good mix of faster and slower spirituals, sung with conviction and skill. It is more of an operatic approach, but it seems to work well. Jessye Norman is more successful in this genre than Battle. Norman is a mountain of a woman with a voice to match. The numbers they sing together come off very well, and ""He's got the whole world in his hands"" is very moving. It has the excitement only found in live recordings."
5,Magnificent,"One of the finest CD's Ive ever listened to, even better when you have someone as magificent as Jessye Norman and of course Kathleen Battle. Two tremendous stars that shine bright in anyones life."
5,uhm......yeah right!!,"Clearly you are mistaken. I don't know who that guy is-the person below recommended-but there is NO COMPARISON to JESSYE NORMAN AND KATHLEEN BATTLE!!!! Jessye Norman herself has *30* HONARY DOCTRATES from places like Harvard, Juliard, Yale, Cambridge....I mean HELLO!!!! That guy had no where near the ease, the musicality or even the breath support as these two veterans show!! It is a beautiful CD though it came out in 1991 and I HIGHLY recommend it."
1,scadalise my name,this isn't that good specially after hearing William Warfeild sing it. You can find him at www.wlym.com
5,Super Book--You will not be dissapointed!,This book will help you with most of the steps that you need to be familiar with when using your TI calculator. All the examples have step-by-step instructions--just like it should be. All the books by these authors are straight forward and to the point--which is to improve your understanding of your calculator and that of the subject matter.There are no other books being published that address the needs of the advanced math student like GILMAR's.
4,Achieve the impossible,"A truly inspiring and deeply passionate story of a middle class boat-owner's son from the remote village in India,and now the President of India.To succeed in life and achieve results,reading this book is a must,because it portrays the positive thinking & struggle he underwent to take his country into the small group of nations which possesses satellite launch capability, and the most sophisticted missile defence system.He proves ""Your willigness to use your own resources to invest your life, especially your imagination, will bring you success."
3,What do I say?,"Dr. Kalam is a man who is fond of the following things a) Simplicity in life b) India's self-reliance c) commitment to technological growth d) Patriotism.This book is written in simple style, absolutely no pomp and hype, which makes it surprising, especially for a man of Dr. Kalam's stature. On the other hand, isn't he the one who is known for simplicity?I strongly believe this book is a superficial account of his life and progress in his professional career.I certainly expected more information, but may be I need to read his other book as well on his vision of India."
5,Great Sauce Pan!,This is a great pan to use for sauces. I would recommend it if you are looking for a classic sauce pan.
2,More sex than power,Wilson's initial statement that the misguided figures he discusses are driven by both sex and power is not followed through in the book which mainly emphasises the sexual adventures of the cult figures. This gets tedious and finally becomes a superficial account of their influence. The book becomes a numbing compendium of weird figures and their hateful habits with little cohesive ideas on the dynamics of these groups other than some basic observations. There is nothing much new in here from Wilson who has been plowing the same field for many years. He writes well and the antics of some of the gurus are amazing but on the whole it's a shallow piece that diminishes Wilson's work.
1,Tripe & Onions,"Every so often I pick up a Colin Wilson book, lured a by title that is inevitably better than the book. This has been done better by a dozen other authors, even including Ronald Knox's sedate and funny ""Enthusiasm"" almost 50 years ago. Wilson ruins the material by being trite, incredibly obsessed with his own boring sex life, and silly. He pretends scholarship, but there is no evidence of it, no way to verify his peculiar statements, and nothing objective. The topic is important, in fact, as these undisciplined characters endanger society. It's a pity Wilson is best at trivializing everything but himself."
3,You'll pas if you use other materials too.,"This product merely introduces topics, offers a brief summary and recommends intenet websites. If you are like I am and haven't discussed these topics since the 6th grade, you will want to consult other CSET study guides as well."
2,Better than Cliff Notes but not by much...,My advice is not to waste time and money on these guides or at the very least use them as a starting point. Don't make the mistake of just using study guides to pass the CSET. Take a prep class and research on specific topics that you are having problems with. The actual test is much more difficult than any guide could prepare you for. After reading the positive reviews I really don't understand how this guide alone can be attributed to ensuring someone pass the CSET. I am taking subtest II in September and have already signed up for a prep class at my university. Will use Kaplan guide as primarily a supplement. Be aware of its shortcomings is all I am saying....
2,Do not depend on this book alone.,I thought that when I was going to take my first subtest that I was going to do great because I had studied this book and looked up additional information like the book suggested. When I went and took my first section I froze because this test was NOTHING like what I studied in this book. Plus the book had a lot of typos and some wrong answers. A lot of the websites did not work either. I am now looking for another test guide and possibly taking a prep course for my next section.
5,Good Product - Great Company,"I use the stone every day and have had zero problems. It has no odor (that I can detect) and I have none either (that my wife can detect.) Web Vitamins packaged the stone carefully to ensure that there was no breakage - unlike the Nutricity order which was broken upon receipt and not replaced by Nutricity.If you have soldiers overseas - in Afghan - send them one of these. It keeps the enemy from ""smelling"" where you are and it keeps your fellow soldiers from, shall we say, a bit of offensive odor one can have in the field.This is a good product and a Great company!"
1,Please dont buy this,"I bought this as our child had multiple well documented ear infections. I found this very difficult to use - could not visualize the ear drum/membrane very well. After trying for a couple of times, I went ahead, returned this and bought a medical grade otoscope by ADC (available via Amazon), and liked that a lot. Though this is a good looking instrument, and seems to be designed well, I am not sure why it doesnt work very well in visualizing the eardrum. I am pretty sure it isnt merely my technique - the ADC otoscope works very well in my hands.."
2,get what you pay for,Summer Infant Ear & Throat Exam Kit was really inexpensive. It felt like it was made by fisher Price and was only a toy. I was hoping for a better product tht I could actualy examine my son's ears in regards to infection and tube placement. I was unable to use it for its titled use
2,You get what you pay for...,"I should have either gone with a more expensive model or skipped out altogether on this purchase. It's basically a toy. The tip constantly falls off. I realize it is meant to be replacable, but it shouldn't stay in the ear of the person your looking into the ear of. Being what I now know about ear infections (that they don't necessarily need to be treated every time), I think I should just leave the diagnosing to the professionals and then I can decide whether or not to administer antibiotics.The good news is that when my son is old enough that the peices are not considered a choking hazard, I can probably give this to him to play doctor with."
2,Not what I expected,I was requesting the aria from Shawshank Redemption...but not to be heard on this specific cd. So unhappy!!! Good selections but not what it WAS suppose to be. AM I wrong or deaf...please advise. Thank you so much.
2,"Diplomacy, war, marraige abound, oh my!","This book is good for diplomacy and marraige fanatics, but for a BattleTech 'Mech jock like me there is just too much cuddling. Instead of inviting Maxamillian Laio to the ""wedding"" (and soon to be declaration of war), I would of brought the Davion Assault Gaurds to Sian and killed the son of a gun!!!"
4,Your most typical types of Sacrifices will be found in this book,"This is a classic! Speilmann presents numerous sacrifices by theme and gives agreat examples. This book has stood the test of time and is still worthwhile to get. Perfect books to compliment this are ""Art of Attack in Chess"" and ""Winning Chess Traps: Tactics in the Opening"". All three of these books will give you exactly what you need to be fully covered when it comes to fully understanding everything to do with Attacking Chess and Sacrificing!"
5,Vernor's Rocks!,Best Ginger Ale ever! You would have to be crazy to drink Canada Dry if you had the choice.
4,Great Gadget!,This is a lifesaver when you have to charge your phone at the same time you are running your GPS or iPod. I travel a lot and it is holding up really well. Great product.
3,"Good reminders, easy read","My boss told us he would be buying this book for the supervisory staff and I bought and read the book early.It is a very simple read and nothing is revelational, but it is well organized and hits the main points supervisors should be thinking of.I've been sharing the book with employees interested in becoming supervisors to give them some perstpective on the expectations of the job."
2,"Interpol, minus the talent...","I'd call these guys cool if there wasn't a bunch of better bands already set out to conquer that label.Elefant's sound is very reminiscent of the other NY Band INterPol, though With Elefant you get a more simple effect, I call them The 3 piece Interpol.The singer's voice (Diego) is tolerable, I'll give them that... but not very much is to be said about what he gives life to (and the cheesiest lyrics award goes to....)I gave my copy away after a few listens, I don' think I can get into a band of this magnitude...I suggest ""The Walkmen"" or ""Starflyer 59"" to fill your need for New and Exciting bands...unless you've already filled it"
3,This is original,"plz dont compare this band to anyone just say its diferent and sometimes catchy, i like 4 of there song but after i heard it a few times except for the song love thats a good bizarre deep song, mizfits and sun makes me paranoid is good as well, id say buy it used its better than whats out there right now.....crap really is whats out there, xcept maybe the bravery,just listen to the radio or mtv same ole stuff over and over so this band provides some relief.if you dont own bravery then buy that first.."
2,come on..,"The best thing about this recording is that the bass was pushed way forward in the mix.The lyrics are so cliche ridded it becomes first hilarious then sad.The music itself is middling and the vocals a little too cloying for my taste.Do yourself a favor a pick up: Interpol ""turn on the bright lights"", The Cure ""three imaginary boys"", or The Changes if you want the real deal."
1,CHEESE,Blatant sentimentality without any touch of irony or wit = Elefant's lyrics. I personally like Interpol and the Strokes; I resent that they are being compared to these cheeseballs.
4,this band isnt doing anything special but...,"this album stays in my cd player from start to finish everytime! i love it! kinda got a bit of an interpol flavor to it, but i dont think theyre an imitation at all. so, though not necessarily innovative, elefant will make you sing along (or bob your head, or whatever you do when you like music... dance a jig?)"
5,My favorite album of all time,Music is a passion of mine and my taste is extremely varied. This particular album is the only album I have ever listened to from beginning to end on a regular basis without skipping songs. I love the feeling I get from this album and the song positioning is perfect. My favorite CD of all time and I have thousands! I highly recommend listening to the whole thing more than once and you won't be able to deny the happy warm feeling you have during and afterwards. :)
5,EXCELLENT SERVICE,"Yo, I got this CD in three days from California (I'm in Philly). It was in awesome condition, brand to the new. Cats did a good job, I'd buy from them again."
5,The most vital book on the subject in fifty years,"North has done something no author has done with regard to his subject in far too long; he actually took the time to look into it and put forth his own thoughts instead of regurgitating the works of others. (Most notably Stanley's ""search for AS paganism"") Just when I thought there was little ground left to break on the subject, along comes North's book and challenges long held and long overlooked aspects of Anglo Saxon pagan belief. From the onset of the book to the final chapter on Paulinus and the Stultus Error (which is brilliant I would like to add)I did not set this book down once. A must have for the student of Anglo Saxon culture and Theodisc Heathens alike. Brilliant work from a brilliant scholar. Wes thu Peter North hal!"
5,One of the best books ever written.,"North's scholarship is amazing. His reasoning is very fluid, even slippery at times, but he pulls in such a weight of understanding that his conclusions are inescapable. Its a real pleasure to see how the guy's mind works."
5,Smoooooooooooth!!!,"I enjoyed this CD so much I bought 4 more to give as gifts.THANK YOU, Mr. Traynor!!!"
2,dry clean only,The ad says machine wash but the tag says dry clean only. They are beautiful and well worth the money IF you don't mine dry clean only.
3,Very good purchase for the price,"I love the comforter and the pillows that came in the set. However, the bedsheet is not big enough for a queen size bed (and that is a problem). But overall I think it is a good set to be gifted or used in the guest room."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this set for $29.99 in January. It looks nice right out of the box. However, there are a couple of caveats. The label says dry clean only, and judging by the feel of the material, I would never put this in a washing machine. Also, the stitching has already started to come apart.You get what you pay for, and I'm glad that I did not pay more than $30 for this. The only reason this gets 3 stars is because of the price."
2,Why Amazon ruine their reputation selling this item?,It think the way Amazon show the orginal price for this item as 3oo bucks is rather misslead buyer to think they're getting a good bargain for 10 times less the price. I got this item and returned it right away as a defective product. The quality is really bad. The tread is loose and hanging out almost every corner. The silk material feel really cheap and the trim on the pillow is glued on instead of sewing..imagine that!I think either display the realistic price ..or better take it out entirely. I am very disappoint with my purchase on this one.I hope my review help you decide.
2,"Pretty fabric, but not worth full price",I bought this when it was for sale at $30. So it was hardly worth paying postage to send it back. The particulars: The bedskirt hem was unfinished (just whipstitched). The material on the whole thing - perhaps some sort of silk - is rather flimsy. I cannot imagine anyone ever paying anything near $300 for it. The pattern is actually quite nice and from a distance looks very nice on the bed.
2,Rose Comforter review,"Although it is a good deal at that price, the comforter has no jacquard work except the lace at the edges.The color is not as bright as shown in the picture though"
4,Really high quality strings,"For advanced cellists these may seem scratchy at first, but once they are broken in, you will never go back to Pirazzis or Larsens on the C or G string. They are more expensive, but WORTH it and last a longer time than most C or G strings."
1,ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGED,"Wish i could give this item an 0. but the lowest rating is a 1.here is whyafter receiving the item and trying it out on my stereo, the cd turned out to be something completely different!!!!! there were 16 songs on the cd which sounded like it was from a musical or some sort. i couldn't believe my ears. the contents had absolutely nothing with its contents. what made this worse was i purchased it as a gift...thank you amazon for sending me such a ""wonderful"" cd."
5,Absolutely Incomparable. By Far the Best 1812 I Could Ever Hope to Hear,"I'm extremely short on time just now and can't write out the glowing review this exquisite and powerful disc of recordings truly deserves, but let me just say briefly that this performance of the 1812 Overture with full choir singing the hymn melody in both the quiet beginning and exultant end is unbelievably powerful and the very best I've ever heard. The climax is so stunning in its magnificent grandeur that every time I hear it, I want to jump up and celebrate, even though I have no interest in the actual politics whatsoever. I simply can't imagine a better performance ever surfacing."
5,Best of the BEST,"This 1812 Overture by Neeme Jarvi is BY FAR the best I've experience! The chorus! The bells from the church! The Orchestra! Everything together brings us the best 1812 we could find! No tired of listening this performance at home, car iPod, etc. Superb!!!"
5,My daughter's favorite,"Not only is the story fun, the illustration are FANTASTIC. Non readers as well as older children will love this. How on earth can someone not know a ship is on their head? Are there really little people? Get a load of those clothes and hair styles. The ridiculous sparks the imagination of children. Elementary schools and public libraries should own it. It can lead to some educational discussions on past customs and costumes"
5,Absolutely amazing...,"The title really says it all. It's a mellow disk, but absolutely stunning. Peter's voice is haunting and beautiful, and Markus's talent really shines through in the music. The songwriting is amazing in every vocal track, and even the instrumental ""In time"" is emotional. Kein Zurück really stands out as a heartfelt track, even if you don't speak German. If you're going to buy one CD, this should be it. Flawless masterpiece."
5,Great Album!,"I didn't know much about Wolfshiem but after hearing their song Kien Zuruck, I knew I had to give this band a try.I must say I was not disspointed one bit.It is VERY rare that I enjoy an album from beginning to end however Casting Shadows is and exception to the rule.The album generally follows suit with uplifting beats and soft lyerics. But every song manages to stand on it's own even within the genre.I can't tell you the amount of times i've played it in the background for guests who usually dont listen to this type of music and I'll hear them reply ""this is nice who is this?""Well this is that band."
3,Excellent and ehhh....,"it sounds strange to say both - but the songs that are good, are Excellent and the others are just good."
4,Good,Good album. Doesnt come close to the emotion or originality of Spectators but still holds them superior to most groups in this genre.
2,What a disappointment,"After purchasing ""Spectators,"" I eagerly awaited this release by Wolfsheim. Their first album had such a distinct and unique sound and I've found since its' release, many electro/synth bands have tried to replicate their style. ""Casting Shadows"" seems to be a lot of regurgitated dance industrial fluff, offering none of the original and crisp sound of the bands' first effort. In addition, I found the vocals rather whiney. I find the singer difficult to listen to with this one. I was quite impressed with his vocal stylings on the first record, so I'm not sure what happened. If you've just discovered this band, I would recommend that you purchase ""Spectators"" instead of ""Casting Shadows."" The sound of ""Casting Shadows"" is very accessible and definitely typical. I think the album's only saving grace is ""Wunderwoll,"" and solely for that I will give this record two stars."
2,Unbearable lightness of being,"This album is well arranged, but one will have to decide when hearing the vocals whether this is good singing or an acquired taste for pathos. Basically the singer warbles in the same pitch over some well arranged synthpop. Sometimes retro, but also moving into ""house"" territory with ""Wundervoll"" which though very catchy can grate on your nerves. Lyrically Wolfsheim is on a higher level than most bands of this genre, but if one would go back through alot of early Gary Numan or Human League albums you wouldn't really find this release that overpowering."
2,A BORING AND REPETITIVE ALBUM,"The latest Wolfsheim CD is boring. No evolution, rather a step backwards. I bought this CD because ""Spectators"" is probably one of my ""top 5"" albums. I tried, but I could not find any of the emotion and melancholy they used to have. No interesting sounds, and the lyrics are repetitive and boring. By the time you reach track number 6, you lose hope and realize that Wolfsheim sensitivity is completely gone.If you want a CD to dance poppy-electronic music then buy ""Casting Shadows"" (although there are better electro-pop bands). But if you want to put your headphones on, lay down and think about life, you better buy ""Spectators"". In conclusion: ""Casting Shadows"" made me yawn; ""Spectators"" made me cry."
2,Lanzar who?,I have a 2005 Toyota Avalon Limited with the JBL Synthesis upgrade 5 channel amp 75wx4 plus 360w x1 sub I was looking for a little more power without having to make much changes to the factory system so I was recommended to add this Lanzar 5 channel amp rated at 1600 4x175w and 1x 375watt..however at high volumes the AMP continues to overload and shut down.
4,Kathy Smith project you upper body,This is an all encompassing upper body workout. She covers every muscle in the upper body including three sets of 50 crunches. Recommend this wholeheartedly.!
1,No longer supported!,This software would not load on my operating system (Windows ME) and is no longer supported by anyone!! There is no recourse or upgrade available (I tried!) - proceed with caution as this purchase was a complete waste for me.
4,Nice shoe!!,I bought these shoes for my wife and she loves them.She works in them and says they are super comfortable!!They fit good and look great!!
5,Don't Miss This Audio Experience,"I am a non-technical amateur, but to my ears, the sound on this CD is amazing. DG seems to have gotten it just right. I feel I can hear every horn, string and swish of the baton. Others have reported slow tempi and indeed the first movement clocks in about 1:30 longer than his other renditions. But with the mesmerizing sound, it doesn't matter. I've heard The Fourth thousands of times; this one blew me away. Be sure and put it in a CD player for your first go-round; don't degrade it into an .mp3 for portable use. Take the time to listen to it as is, and you'll find that twelve bucks is a bargain for such an audio experience."
3,Three stars is generous . . .,"This isn't an awful or poorly written book, but it really seemed skin-deep to me (42yo male). The author skimmed the topics, even though she apparently interviewed a lot of men. It just isn't deep at all -- to me, it was like watching a television show. By comparison, ""Iron John"" by Robert Bly was very deep and thoughtful. Years after I read that book, I'm still thinking over some of what he said."
4,Understanding Men's Passages,"It's an easy-to-read book for the amateur trying to figure out where the man in my life is going. Since he's still in my house, it's good to have a map."
2,Not All It's Cracked Up To Be,"Although well written and researched, Gail Sheehy's book was a major disappointment. Having experienced many years of discomfort, especially on location, I assumed that somewhere in 'Understanding Men's Passages' I'd find advice on how to treat my chronic hemorrhoids. Alas, not a word. Clint Eastwood made the same mistake, but he cured his by actually reading the book in one sitting."
1,This is more of a kid's toy,"If you are looking for a real guiro, do not buy this one. I was very disapointed to find that it is more of a toy than a musical instrument. The shell is way too thick causing the volume to be entirely too low for professional use."
5,Simply The Best!,"Zane's explanation of these epistles will remove any confusion you may have about them. His analysis is simple, like the text of the epistles, yet profound in the challenges and implications to the Christian's life. This is simply the best commentary on the the Epistles of John."
1,"Don't bother ordering it, - amazon can't deliver!","For anyone interested in buying or ordering this item - don't bother!!!! I ordered this item on June 2, 2005, and as of October 18 am still waiting to receive it - this is despite the fact that Amazon claim it ships in 3-5 business weeks (when I ordered it website claimed 3-5 business days). Amazon keep sending me e-mails asking do I still want the product - which I go to the website and comfirm the order - given it was to be an anniversary gift (June 12), however no one at Amazon will ever respond to any e-mails you send asking why it hasn't been shipped etc. I dare say Amazon probably won't post this rating either - nor will they get back to me!"
5,Bookstore quality,I got the same book as I would in my college bookstore for over $150 cheaper! I would definitely buy from here next semester!
4,Great!!,Very fast delivery! Book was new just as described! There was a dent in the cover but i think that may have happened in the shipping process. Over all I'm very satisfied though! Thank you!
4,Environmental Science: A Global Concern,I received the book in a timely manner. I got it in time for the start of my class and that's greatly appreciated.
1,should be recalled!,Shortly after buying this slow cooker the plastic off/low/high knob cracked and broke off. After about a year the plastic side handle broke off when I picked it up (I was lucky not to spill hot liquid on me). After searching the internet for reviews I found out that several other people have had the same problem. this item needs to be recalled because someone can get burned by hot liquid or broken glass if they drop it when the handle breaks. For your safety I recommend you not buy it.
5,Great for Cheese Dip,"I love it! I usually use it for cheese dips, that way you don't have to keep warming them up."
2,Model SC-152,"I purchased this l.5 quart slow cooker at Fleet Farm in Stevens Point, WI on black friday last Nov.I have noticed a hot spot in this cooker at about 3 or 4 o'clock looking at it from the front. Twice I had meat burn after starting it at high for and hour or so and then on low for about 5 or 6 hours."
2,I've read much better,"The on-line reviews of this Navy seal story looked good. I was not impressed. This is the first from Christina Syke that I have read. I found myself getting lost and having to re-read text to see who was talking. At one point I thought the characters were still in the hotel when further on I realized they moved to the car. I've ready many ho-hum stories but rarely with such choppy dialog. With so many other books on my ""to read"" list, I felt this book a waste of time.For a good romantic Navy SEAL series, try Suzanne Brockmann's Over the Edge, Out of Control and Into the Night!"
1,In Need of a Good Editor!,"First, there's the place where the author refers to ""President Franklin"" - you know, the guy on $100 bills? Let's see, what number was he?Then there's the silver Audi that follows the heroes - this is on an island in the Caribbean, mind you - that turns out to be ""registered to a couple of tourists from Iowa"" - who, naturally, shipped their precious car down to an island so they could drive it around on their vacation.Flaming stupidity like this makes me laugh in all the wrong places. Not that I expect that much from romance novels - they're meant to be easy, escapist reads - but the errors in this one were egregious."
3,pretty good read,"WARNING - this review will give away part of the ending.I enjoyed this book until the end, when a detail caused by poor editting irritated the enjoyment out of me. A character announces that she is four months pregnant. Next chapter (marked ""Seven Months Later""), she goes into premature (by one month) labor, according to dialogue spouted by another character. Hello? Four months, plus seven and she's still one month to term? There are a lot of editting errors that won't be caught, but come on -- a twelve month pregnancy? That is just poor editting."
1,OMGOSH! ---THIS BOOK STUNK!!!,"Ben Franklin was NEVER president of the US and you can't deliver premature if you've been pregnant for over ELEVEN months. The list of what was wrong with this book was too numerous to give in detail. The horribly underdeveloped flat characters, the crazy contradictions, the vast jumping around of scenes and emotions, the boring undefined plot and mystery, the horrendous editing...just names a few. This book was actually painful to finish, it went way past a total waste of time."
1,THESE ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL HITS!,"Chubby Checker's original dancing classics like ""The Twist,"" ""Pony Time,"" ""Limbo Rock,"" and ""Let's Twist Again"" were issued originally on Parkway/Cameo Records. These classics hits never have been issued on CD stateside, but I thought I would try a European issue to see if it contained the real thing. Unfortunately, it doesn't. If you want the Chubby Checker hits you've danced and listened to your whole life, you won't find them here!"
5,One of the better general British history books out there,"The first in this three part series (and companion to the amazingly good BBC documentary series) this is a fact filled history book that is actually easy to get into - you can actually read it cover to cover rather than look up in the index what interests you. Much of this is down to Schama's engaging writing style - not quite casual, but definitely not dry and dusty. This book manages to steer an even keel, avoiding parochialism and Politically Correct revisionism. An entertaining read for those interested in British history - the title really says it all."
1,History of England/Britain?,"Schama's lapses into the demotic are quite irritating because it forces him to over stress a point for the sake of writing brilliance. He has incorrect facts on many pages, which again is another irritating aspect of Schama but he does remind us that history is in the eye of the author. His emphases, asides and elicited facts show his background and own history and allows the reader to compile his own history. This is most certainly NOT a definitive history of Britain but a contribution to it. It may make, hopefully, others read fuller and more magisterial versions."
4,"A tad sciolistic, but an entertaining read","There are ample names and locations with which to keep up, and Schama does a respectable job at keeping them organized. The insights are valuable, the anecdotes, compelling--and that characteristic British flair for the pithy is pervasive."
5,Hungry for Vol. II,"I loved this book! I'm travelling to London this summer, and wanted a good read to make the details of my trip more meaningful. I started by reading textbook-style histories that left me sorting through fleeting names and dates as I closed the back cover. This book kept me on the edge of my seat! You get a real taste of the personalities of these often cruel, power-hungry people. It reads like a soap opera. William the Conqueror, Henry II, etc. are permanent fixtures in my memory now!"
4,"Wow, it's a BLOODY story","This book kept me up at night wanting to know more! This early history of Britain reads like an action movie with beheadings, treachery, betrayal, bloodletting, ( and as always, oppression of the common people). If you tried to sell it as a movie script it would be too unbelievable! I read the Talk/Mirimax edition with lots of illustrations and photos, and I must say, I enjoyed that."
5,One of the funnier ones!,While Kyle's mom is out trying to raise social awareness of the school nurse's disorder(a deceased fetus on her head)The kids are on a dogde ball tournoment in China. This one's got it all folks! Next is the Mexican Staring Frog of Sotuhern Sri Lanka. After giving the kids misinformation about Vietnam The kids set out to ruin Jimbo and Ned's hunting show. Lots of laughs!
4,Some of the most on-target satire since Swift,"Once more, South Park videos pair one great episode with a so-so one.The great one is ""Conjoined Fetus Lady"", where Kyle's Mom (South Park's gung-ho Social Activist) goes off on a crusade for the school nurse's deformity. As one who has had experience with Baby Boomer activists (and been on the receiving end of their ""concern"" and ""compassion""), I can vouch that the characterization of Kyle's Mom is dead-on accurate. It'll make you think as well as laugh or groan; if not -- especially if your ""enlightened sensitivity"" is offended -- get right up on the podium with Kyle's Mom, while I have a laugh at the absurdity of you all."
2,Small watch with a big problem,"It is a beautiful watch, elegant, feminine, however the band is expandable. I have a pretty narrow wrist so the watch was pretty much hanging on my wrist. I went to so many places in NYC to fix the expandable band - to make it smaller, noone took up this work because it is too hard.I had to return it, I felt really bad because I fell in love with it, but it is just too bad that the band is expandable."
3,Good and Bad,"Just wanted to make a point that I know several of the hikes in this book, and where some are great places to take my dog, there is one in particular that I wouldn't recommend for dogs. I was disappointed in the recommendation of The Bergen Peak trail; I find the trail too narrow and rocky to share with mountain bikers. It was an awful experience and I vowed never to go there with my dog again. I had to be constantly alert to mountain bikers coming from both directions, and I had to pull my dog off of the trail every time they went by because there is not enough room for all of us. I KNOW that mountain bikers are supposed to yield to my dog and me, but I have been in too many situations where they don't; and if they are coming downhill, their momentum is too fast to stop. I prefer to take my dog where I don't have to share the trail with mountain bikers."
1,Worse than useless book,"After traveling from Texas, we used this book to select a quick 2 mile hike on our first day in Colorado,. Upon getting started on the hike, we realized that the author's idea of an easy hike was way off base. The hike had 500 feet of elevation gain per mile and was way to steep to enjoy with our dogs on leashes (especially downhill). Later we researched the hike with another author and found the hike graded as strenuous. A local hiker asked us on our hike why we picked the such a steep trail for our initial hike. We will not use the Best Hikes with Dogs Colorado again. We will do our own research and calculate the elevation change ourselves.If you are an advanced mountain hiker and work with your dog off leash frequently, this book will probably work for you. If you are a flatlander and come to Colorado for its wonderful mountains, the hikes selected in this book are probably too aggressive for hiking with your dog."
2,Inaccurate re: off-leash hikes,"I bought this book when my husband and I moved to Colorado two years ago. It's a decent resource for getting ideas, but contains inaccurate information on off-leash and leashed areas. We specifically seek out off-leash hikes to do with our 80-lb mixed breed dog, and have several times been misled by this book.For example: The book recommends hiking Mt. Belford and Mt. Oxford, two fourteeners, notes that it is ""some or all off-leash""--but the peaks are located in the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness. Wilderness designations are strictly on-leash areas.So, if you buy this book, definitely do your own research on the trails before you go. Don't count on all the information to be accurate."
4,Great game!,"I hven`t played this title into another console than the wii but it has a great storyline a fantastic adaptation to follow from the original movie and hey even the soundtrack on this game is fantastic, hand picked!This is a great shooter and mobster game the controls for the wii are perfect making this a very playable game without taking aditional adjustments like on other wii games regarding camera problems. Here You have 4 different camera modes Im sure one of them will suit your needs.Still my favorite wii game so far remains The Godfather Blackhand edition."
2,I think i traded this in.,"This game was not very good. I heard it was the most GTA-like game on the Wii, and since I had so much fun playing The Godfather, I thought I'd try it out. It was really boring and disappointing."
1,Overkill,"Now, it's true that this game is awesome, just like eeryone else has said, but there is a fatal flaw.While porting this game over to the Wii, they made tweaks here and there and did a fabulous job adapting the Wiimote and nunchuk.The problem lies in the 3rd level of South Beach. The job on the old version was so easy that they decided to beef up the difficulty and ruined their game by doing so. The level is now unpassable and therefore you cannot progress into the final level of North Beach. Just to let you know I'm not whining, Scarface will let you play the 4th level of South Beach and it fit in w/ the difficulty of the whole game.It had taken me 2 weeks to get to the 3rd level of South Beach, and now I've been playing the same level for 2 weeks.This is a perfect example of how to ruin a great game. Avoid buying this at all costs, unless you enjoy repetition."
1,Terribly distorted sound,"I find this album to be unlistenable simply because the sound is so horribly distorted. This 3-girl Japanese intense punk band is promoted as a ""loud punk rock band,"" so if ""loud"" means ""distorted"" to you, you might like this, but I prefer my loud music to be clear."
3,Too many mistakes on the kindle edition,"I have nothing negative to say about the content. I only wish that I had bought a hard copy instead. There is an average of about 5-8 mistakes per page, making it impossible to enjoy and some sentences even impossible to understand. Buy the hard copy instead."
5,Excellent Resource,"This book is filled with very helpful information. It focuses mainly on infertile couples (at least in the beginning) which is not very helpful for a single woman looking to adopt, but the author provides thought provoking ideas and a few laughs in between. It is almost impossible to put down. It is an American book, so the resources provided are not much help to Canadian readers, but they provide a basis on where to start your own search."
5,great info,"a wealth of info. this is the book to use to educate yourself on the world of international adoption. many adoption stories to read, also."
5,Brilliant!,Steve Coogan is fantastic! I can't believe he doesn't have a higher profile in America. This is in regard to the streaming version so I don't know the video quality of the disc version.
3,No Difference,I'm taking this for endometriosis. I haven't noticed a difference and I've been taking it for 3 months. Maybe I haven't been taking it long enough... It's brobably good for something else though.
2,disappointing,"Despite Bernstein's best efforts to provide a ""true"" interpretation of Beethoven, his Eroica falls flat. The funeral march is the most lifeless, slow, uninspired reading I've heard. Klemperer also takes the movement slow, but his reading is filled with grandeur and depth, not shallow, ingartiating pitty, the way Bernstein plays it. The movement seems to go on forever! Then there's the Fidelio. You would think he could pull of a simple overture. He starts out with tremendous energy at the introduction, but the pause before the entry of the french horns is too long. After the intro, Bernstein starts to slow down the tempo. Why??? It's all amounts to another mediocre performance."
3,Handy but not the ultimate.,"What one really needs is a handy holster on your belt to carry a reacher while standing on a ladder, so when you are putting together furniture or doing other assemblying or when up on a step ladder installing telephone wire for your Tivo or computer modem around the top of a wall next to the ceiling above the doors and windows and trying to hold the wire in place with one hand, hold a staple gun in the other, and tuck the wire up with the other hand! By the way that last hand belongs to your helper who is standing firmly on the floor steadying the ladder while you hold on precariously. ;o0But this clip will also do to carry a reacher, which is really needed when you drop something while assembling furninure and need to pick up those pesky screws or bolts that you inevitable drop, so then, you don't hsve to bend over, and srand on your head to pick up the one that rolled under the furninture or otherwise is ""hiding in plain sight.""! :o) Thats's what themagnet is for."
4,Unique concept,It's a pretty fun game. I enjoy the uniqueness of it all. I've never really played a game like it before.
4,fun,"really fun to start gets stall after the first 6-10 hours same basic thing over and over, good game over all and would recomend it"
4,It's Good,This game is good for passing time. It really didn't grab me to where I felt like i had to play again. The controlls are a little weird but not that bad. All around it is a fun game just to mess around with.
4,Game with a fun twist,"Overlord gives you the opportunity to play the other side of the hero's pendulum, though you can be a ""good"" evil overlord too. Controling minions to do your evil bidding provides a restful split from the hero is everything game play that you might be use to...but you can be a more direct player by attacking and doing certain actions yourself. There are a few different options to choose during the game that affect the outcome adding some replay value to the game. Overall, a very fun game to release stress on-"
1,Terrible,I love fantasy games and this was probably the worst one I've encountered. Boring... Traded in at GameStop
2,A bit poo really. Disappointing.,"I was hoping to have some fun on this game, I gave it two evenings and then gave up on it. The control system is rubbish, the boundaries on the game are rubbish. You basically walk around and control a swarm of minions to do predictable things like smash pots and chop up flowers. Woo.It should have been called Disneys Overlord. Or Fisher-Price, my first Overlord. The other reviewer is right. Your evil tasks include freeing human slaves from other evil creatures and getting food for them. After the 5 hours of tiresome play I took it back to the shop.Everyone's got their own opinions but the rubbish voice acting, rubbish ""humourous"" comments and complete lack of diversity in play (run here, point minions at fallen bridge, onto next room, point minions at bad guys) made sure that I fell asleep not once, but twice while playing.Cack with a capital C."
2,Non Review --- but with a short word of advice.,"Game: Not my thing.My Advice: Whenever possible gamers should take advantage of the free game demo downloads available on Xbox Live before spending the cash for a game that may be lacking. I tried the demo to this game and knew quite quickly that this would not be a game that I would enjoy. I mean, seriously, if the game makers can't put their title's best foot forward in a short playable demo then the full game is not likely to be good either.Save money for good games."
4,Fun Mayhem,This is the funnier side to all those fantasy RPGs out there. Absolutely love having the minions run around and hack stuff up. The only bad side to this game is the camera takes a little time to get used to. If you like those games where you get to be bad then at least rent this game.
3,Fun...but lacking....,"The game is good. It has alot of customizable elements that make you get into the mode of ""just one more level"" that plagues all serious gamers.What makes is fun is that you can loot and pillage with an army of underlings until your heart's content. You can build and upgrade your castle and own effects as you gain certain levels, equipment, and most importantly...gold.The problem is that 90% of the upgrades to your castle do nothing. They're just asthetic value. And until you get the final forge, your weaponry is pretty worthless against some foes. And forget about harvesting the maximum amount of goblins, because that takes for-ev-er."
3,"Fun Game, but not Great","This game was a lot of fun to play, it is a little deceptive at first because its cartoon style makes it appear juvenile, but the content and gameplay is probably more suited for teen and older.The games puzzles aren't so hard that they distract from the gameplay, but they can be tedious and annoying. The gameplay is pretty fun, the combat style is a little different from most games of the genre, which keeps it interesting for a while.Overall, its a fun game, but it can be pretty silly. If cartoonish images and silly dialogue try your patience then I wouldn't reccomend it."
3,Graphics can only take you so far,"The game is a 100% graphical masterpiece. Everything in the environment is colorful and reacts with a strong visual appearances. Although the game falls short onces the visual appeal falls away. The game lacks interesting objective and is far to linear. The ability to control a ""Army"" is fun but grows weary and repetitive. Its a fun game to walk around and enjoy the scenery but lacks stimulant for me to keep playing."
1,Seriously WTF?,Clunky and confusing controls. Controls that don't work as prescribed. Hack-n-slash sorta game with no hack-n-slash. Steer clear of this debacle. I got a good hour of game play and only did the first part of the tutorial... If the tutorial is longer than an hour or if the tutorial confuses the player then that should be a clear signal to the developers to just stop. It definitely got this player to stop.
5,Excellent,I loved this game. It was fun to play even for a person who doesn't like games where you have to kill things. You stand back and let your minions help you accomplish complete domination over your world. I recommend this game to just about everyone.
3,Relaxing yet frustrating.,"This has long been one of my favorite cds, however, since it is all recorded on 1 track, you can't skip around, and the piano is rather faint at times, so unless you turn the volume up, it's difficult to appreciate. The music itself is spectacular, and putting it to a storm was an excellent way to create ambience; however, if all your favorite pieces are at the end, you need to sit or fast forward through fifty minutes of storm to get there. Overall a good album, but there are better collections out there."
4,Realistic autobiography,"This is an intersting picture of a young girl growing up in Guatemala before war tore her life apart. Those who are studying Central America could get an accurate picture of what the area is like for the common man who lives a quiet, family life, helps others, and enjoys the area."
1,A waste of time and money,"I bought it and now I regret it. It is useless. Buy the Aspen Publishers book by Mueller. That's all you need. Perhaps a horn book also. But, the Aspen book should do with a lot of practice tests. Stick to patent law to pass the test. You don't need the whole IP universe. And, once again, this book is a waste. I thought of suing to get my money back."
5,Very Comprehensive Prep Course,"Unlike some ""Regular Joe's"", I believe this prep course is very comprehensive and useful. If you only buy the workbook, you are doing yourself a tremendous disservice. It is intended to be used with the Guidebooks. PES also offers audio CD's and a CD PTO simulator that includes 6 practice exams, comprised of previous Patent Bar questions. There is a 100 page glossary of terms included in the set, so you can learn the language of patent law. Furthermore, an additional handbook that covers patent basics, which includes 9 modules and quizzes on patent basics is also available.Additionally, there customer service is excellent. I have emailed them numerous times to ask questions about the material and always recieve a prompt, courteous response within 24 hours. This course is intended to be a 16 week course, however, I am preparing on a 6 week time frame and feel as if this course is very beneficial in helping me to gain a complete understanding of patent law."
3,Very Heartwarming,"I did enjoy reading this book, with some equivocations: A lot of the stories are of course extremely subjective, which in and of itself is not a bad thing, but when you recount something as fact (that happened in the real world) but was actually a dream, I sort of lose the feeling. How can I relate to a story when the facts of the story did not take place in an area of common ground, but rather in a domain I could never enter, that is - someone's mind?! I have no doubt that Christ or Buddha could enter one's external life a'la Glenda Green and I will listen very intently to your story, but why are you telling me what you dreamed? You might as well be telling me about a video game you just played."
2,Disappointing,"I expected this to be an interesting character study of four very different men caught up together in a situation that would bring out their best or worst and keep us intrigued. I was partly right--it was a character study of four men and the situation did bring out their personalities. Unfortunately the process proved to be a deadly bore, as did the men. I don't know if it was the casting ( the actors are normally very good in whatever part they play) but the whole story just failed to gel or involve the viewer and when the men returned to their regular lives, it was a relief to have it over."
5,great performance for price,"easy to set-up, easy to use. also, I see the video on the receiving end and it's clear (I use Skype like many people). I'd buy it again. :)"
5,Great product,Excellent product - easy setup. My study has a lot of windows with varying light conditions and the camera copes with it beautifully. Highly recommended.
5,Excellent camera - Easy installation,"The product was a snap to install on the computer, we use it for guitar lessons online. The auto focus is great, as the teacher often requires the camera to be moved to view strumming methods etc from different angles. The camera is easy to reposition as the base can be used to hold it on the monitor, or sit at different angles. A very good purchase."
4,High Quality WebCam,"I find this product to be of very high quality. It has a lot of options which could make it very fun, unfortunately I do not believe it is possible to take advantage of them on Skype. Other than the high quality image and sound, the other features can only be accessed if the webcam session is run through Logitech's own webchat software. However, that would require both people on a call to have the same camera, I believe. All in all, though, a good buy and no regrets. There are a lot of options regarding how high quality of a video you want the camera to take when in use, from low resolution, to HD, to 12 MP... only the bandwidth of your and your partner's internet connection can come in the way of that experience."
3,Nothing Special,"I would rate this cam as average+.It doesn't like motion at all. If you are webcamming something that remains still, it does a good job. I also have a Philips webcam that I find superior to this cam and it was $20.00 less. Average+...... Nothing special."
4,"Good camera, microphone - not so much","Works well with Skype. However, we disabled camera microphone and use separate that we used before camera purchase b/c sound quality was not very good. It was not horrible but separate microphone was much clearer (and that microphone is really nothing special)."
3,Works only on Windows,"The picture quality of this Logitech product is good but it's stand is truly quirky. It does not clip onto anything and, if touched, falls over easily. The autofocus hunts so the picture changes all the time as people move around. Turn off autofocus for best results. Download the latest drivers from Logitech if you want the unit to work properly. I really don't think that the unit offers good value and would look for another brand next time. Also there are no MAC drivers available. This is an issue for me as I work both operating systems."
4,5 minute setup webcam,"Quick simple setup for 'free call' use on Logitech Vid, but not everyone is using this service. Skpe was an additional setup, but thankfully the 'assistant' provided the links. Why the video quality via the L-Vid service was lacking is unknown. Webcam itself is good at tracking your head movements."
3,returned due to clip,"The camera works fine. I couldn't find a good way to make the attachment clip/stand work though, the camera would droop and eventually fall out of place. The camera seems too heavy for the clip, or the clip hinges move too easily to hold well.As always, amazon returns are a reason to buy here. Returned for a smaller webcam that works well."
4,birthday gift,"I bought this for my 8 year old niece as a birthday gift. She took right to it and had mastered it in a matter of minutes. A friend of hers came over 30 minutes later and the two of them traded off videoing each other for an hour. It was a great hit. In addition to ease of operation, it is a perfect small size and light weight for small hands."
4,Performs better than expected,"I've had bad experiences with webcams in the past, but I needed one now. I've tried Logitech products before and they've never let me down, so when I saw it on sale I figured I would give it a try. Thanks to this webcam I've had a wonderful time actually communicating with people as opposed to trying to adjust lighting, quality, angle, etc. It worked so well for me I bought one for my brother and his girlfriend to use while they are both away at school. If you need a great webcam at a competitive price, you've found it"
5,Best Cam I've tried,"I bought this product after trying several other web-cams and found it to be much more real in terms of what you could see on your screen and with lighting ect, plus it has many different movement functions. (Try with Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder 3.1, for free if you dont have a very good graphics card or PC)"
5,BEST buy for the $,"Easy to install, good quality. Great buy for the $. Got one for our kids also, and they LOVE it. Installed ""skype"" and it is easy to use.Highly recommend it!"
4,Excellent video quality,I cannot believe how excellent the video quality is. I have had some audio problems but do not know if they are attributable to the camera or Skype. There are some very helpful tips in the other reviews and I am going to try downloading software from the website and deleting the software from the disc. But a great webcam and I was so impressed I bought my daughter one so we can communicate across the miles. Highly recommended. I gave it 4 stars but if the audio problems are Skype's fault then I give it 5. Easy to clip to my monitor too.
5,Great Camera,"This is a very good camera. It is easy to install, easy to use/modify, has great features, both in the software and in the camera itself, and gives great, quality pictures and videos. I am glad the cord is long too."
5,First web cams - a good experience overall,I bought 3 Logitech web cams to stay in touch with my children and grandchildren. Two of the web cams installed easily and were up and running within minutes. However I (an IT professional) had a miserable experience getting mine to install even with my virus checker and firewall turned off. The Logitech website did have very good instructions for troubleshooting and resolving the problems. Now that the cameras are all up and running we are thrilled with the quality of the picture and audio. Even with the installation problems I would recommend the product to Friends.
2,Poor picture quality in comparison to laptop-webcam,The web-cam has poorer picture quality than my nephews' built in web-cam in his cheap Dell laptop. It appears to adjust fairly well to different lighting situations but the picture is not sharp and sometimes is quite pixelated.
2,My experience: not compatible with Skype,"In my experience on Windows XP, Skype froze when using this webcam, time after time. My longest successful Skype video chat was less than 10 minutes; some were less than a minute. Skype crashed so hard that I had to reboot AND disconnect/reconnect the webcam to get the system to even recognize it. I gave this webcam to an out-of-state relative, so it was impractical to return it. I am currently using the ooVoo service for video chat; ooVoo has not displayed the same problem with this webcam. Do a web search on 'Logitech Skype Problems' to see that my experience is not an isolated one."
5,Excellent Product,"The video quality is great! It's also very easy to connect, mount, and use. I plugged the USB into my computer, then I opened MSN and I was able to video-and-sound-connect right away. In addition, I like very much the fact that it has a built-in microphone. That saved me buying an additional microphone piece."
3,Logitech Cam,"This camera goes in and out of focus every few seconds, I have to tap the camera to make it go back into focus. I have complaints about audio quality on the other end, and the focus."
1,Cannot record 720p at 30 frames per second,"This camera will only capture at a maximum of 15 frames per second using the Logitech software. I've tried a variety of third party software to try to capture 30 frames per second, and have not been successful at doing so. So, for video calls this may be a fine option. But if you are trying to record something that needs higher quality, like a video podcast, this camera will not fit the bill."
1,Ugh - no sound,Great picture but unable to get sound if you have wireless router. Everyone is wireless now. You would think they would tell you this up front. You must use hard wired internet connection to get sound and picture going both ways. Now I always need to call separately from the webcam.
5,LogiTech 9000 Webcam Review,Got this logitech quickcam pro 9000 at a terrific price from Amazon; it was quite easy to install and we had it up/running with both a built-in on a laptop and via two laptops within 10 minutes; great video quality; love the built-in microphones
4,decent,"$50 is a good price for the cam, i wouldn't pay $100.lags a little compared to the sony webcams bult in the laptops.i wasn't using vga for my computer monitor so I'm not sure on quality.this model doesn't have the cover for the webcam lens.I'm not a camera person, everything was just ok, nothing stood out to me compared to an older model i have."
5,Great little gadget!,"Simply put - You should buy it! It works under the worst lighting conditions with the minimal of effort - took seconds to turn my blinding daylight that was coming from behind me, and the almost pitch dark that was in front of me, to a completely normal, picture-perfect dream vision of me! :-)Highly recommended!"
5,Works great - Easy setup,"I found the pictures much clearer than with the less expensive ones with plastic lenses.Simple to use - great to see far away family. We're in FL and kids, grandkids and great grandkids are in MA.Worth the $$$"
4,Excellent Webcam for video conferencing,"This webcam is used for Skype. It is mounted atop a 52"" LCD tv, but it slightly wobbly. It is meant to be mounted on a thinner display, but with proper balancing of the usb cable, it stays still on top of the TV. The quality on Windows Vista is superb. The microphone is decent for our 15x30 board room, and temporarily replaced a land line phone. I rate this a 4 of 5 stars because the mounting clip is difficult to work with. I trust the Logitech name for all of my purchases."
5,Great Camera,Buying the QuickCam Pro 900 was my introduction to web cams and I have to say that it has been grand! My friends tell me the quality of my video on their end is awesome. The mic is very good as well.Set up was a breeze and I haven't had any issues thus far.Definitely a great quality device!
5,Better than expected,"We got this web cam for inlaws who are not really computer savvy but wanted to better communicate with parents in another state. I'm not a computer genius, either, but installation was easy and fast plus picture quality was reported as excellent by recipients. I have received skype calls from others with cheaper cameras and although picture quality was ok I was happy to hear that this one provided great quality. I doubt if all the features of this item will ever be used but so far everyone skyping with it is very happy. Pricier than most but you get what you pay for in this case in my opinion."
5,Works as adverstised in 64-bit Windows Vista,"No problem installing or problems with add-on software. Video quality is very good under various lighting levels. Microphone audio quality is really good. Plenty of configuration options too. Software updates are easily downloaded from Logitech through the software. Keyboard hotkeys for the ""privacy shade"" (muted audio and no video) would be a nice to have feature that is not there."
5,Pastor,"I'm exceedingly pleased with the purchase of the Pro 9000. The camera comes with software, but I did not load the software, merely plugged the cable on the camera into the laptop USB port and the programs I use found the new hardware (camera) immediately. I'm told the video picture that others see is excellent, without pauses or distortions. The camera is very portable, provides clear detail of items I might hold up to the camera to be seen, works well in low light conditions, and the microphone does not seem to pick up competing sounds, like the fan on my laptop that often starts when I'm using certain applications. I like the camera."
3,Very speed intensive,This product has a great picture but it is very high in the CPU usage. On Skype the picture is very slow. The product literature says that you need the duel processor to get full usage.
5,WebCam is a Delight,"Our new web camera is bringing our adopted grand-daughter to us every week. We see her in action.(One year old and beginning to walk,she moves about, babbles and plays for our enjoyment.) We can see and hear her it all! Since she lives in LA we cannot visit very often. This product is making all the difference in our communication. The picture and sound are wonderful. Even though we are not computer savvy we were able to install the device and access Skype with a little help from our son-in-law. The pleasure it is affording us can't be exaggerated! All grand-parents who live at a distance from their children should have one!"
2,Logitech Webcam Software v1.1 Windows 7 64 bit issue,"This may be a first-rate, brand new camera but the software provided apparently continues to be a long term issue as of 12/7/2011. Have a Dell 435/9000 with Windows 7 64 bit. Upon attempting install, software shows not compatible. Navigating the solution is not how you will want to spend your life moments. Some day Logitech might get software that prompts updates and auto-fixes."
5,Works great - very high quality,"It installed easily and worked right away. I did have a problem creating videos to upload to UTube so I could send video messages to my email friends. The video went through fine, but I had no sound. I contacted support and got information that I needed to change the setting in my windows sound recorder. Once I did that it works just fine. The product does save files in a .wmv format which creates fairly large video files. I found a program to convert those files to .flv files and the file size was reduced by two thirds and seemed to work just as well.Great video and microphone. I can now talk to my grand kids on SKYPE and get to see them too!"
4,Logitech HD Webcam Pro 9000,"Very easy to install. Nice feature set. Does well in low light. Great price, compared to other webcams. Would recommend this to others in the market for a webcam."
4,Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000,The Logitech quickcam pro 9000 was easy to setup and performed very good. This is my first webcam and I am very happy with it. The picture quality is very good and the microphone works good. I bought 2 on the same day and sent one to my daughter at college. We can now talk and see each other which is very very nice since she is 2 states away. The other good thing is that it is free on skype. I have also asked my sister to get one so I can see her too when we talk.The only bad thing which isn't that bad is the picture sometimes jumps a little or hesitates a little.
4,Good stuff.....,"I got this web-cam a few weeks ago to see and talk with family members in Italy and it's very nice. The set up was easy and the picture is fantastic. The onlt problem now is that my picture is better than everyone else's. Anyway, I would definately recomend this product and will probably buy more to give as Christmas gifts."
2,Capture is too slow,Length:: 3:52 MinsThe video capture is too slow. Watch the video and see why I don't like it.
3,Road warriors beware,"You have to hand it to Logitech, the image quality is really, really good on this webcam... but here's my advice for road warriors: don't buy it.My company bought 27 of these babies Feb 1 for us road warriors. For presentations and video conferencing on the go, as they say.Verdict: after 20 days, 17 of them were broken. Why? The stupid balancing thing in the back either snapped off or broke in half in briefcases. And once that's gone, your logitech is worthless.Other minus: the video looks great, but when you use Hotel connections with it, it's very, very choppy. So don't charge $90 to your company for something they'll have to replace quickly and you can't put in a briefcase.Our company has changed to IPEVO POV webcams - the image quality is enough, works well in hotels, enough lighting conditions for indoor videoconferencing, and, best of all: never breaks."
2,Bugs-Bugs-Bugs,"Not really happy with this webcam as yet. Still trying to work out the bugs in the system. Can not get the sound to work properly but the tech guys believe its a software issue....SO who knows what will happen in the coming weeks (they may issue a critical update for this product). Overall, the picture is brillant but the sound is not up to the standards that one would expect from any type of Logitech product."
4,Nice Camera,Very easy to set up and get rolling with. The picture is excellent quality. I don't feel the face tracking is up to par. The camera is always adjusting itself even if you are sitting still. Never seems to 'sit still' for more than a few seconds so usually I just leave it off. The supplied software with drivers is easy to install and has plenty of features and gadgetry to keep you busy if you are a gadget freak. The camera fits nicely over the top of my LCD monitor and is very study construction wise. I would buy this model again with no reservations.
5,Great web cam for Windows 7,"Logitech always seems to have quality, reliable products. This is my second web cam - had to change because of Windows 7. For the money, this webcam is perfect."
5,Worth every penny !,This is a great product. I love the fact that it has a built in mic.Picture quality is very good even in low light.I personally think it is the best webcam out there.
5,Pro 9000,Really excellent picture quality. Viewers comment on how much better the picture looks than my old Logitech Pro. Worry free packaging is really nice also.
3,Good enough.,"This works OK, but I find the clip/stand doesn't work anywhere I want it to because the cord pulls the camera off-center."
3,/vista and Skype issues,"I bought this webcam to set-up SKYPE and call my mom back in Europe. I installed the software through the web-site which is not recommannded and eventhough I installed everything easily, I could not get Skype(new version ) to work, had an old BETA version. So the camera works ok, sounds ok but picture is not what I expected from it and VISTA doesn't like it much either, wonder if I should upgrade to WINDOWS7. Overall not a bad camera considering the price but could be improved, hence the 3 stars"
4,Windows 7 problem,"I had a little problem with using webcam with win7. However, it is fix now and the webcam works great. Pictures is definitely crystal clear. This is worth the money."
5,High Quality VIdeo from a Web Cam,"This web cam is worth the extra money. Easy to install right out of the box, produces excellent video and sound."
3,Beware Logitech rebate flim flam,"I purchased this camera in April 2009. It's ok. However, I purchased the camera from Amazon as a $10 rebate was offered. I sent in ALL of the required documentation (receipt, original UPC bar code, application), and was later informed that my application was rejected as the UPC code was missing. I sealed this in the envelope myself and have a copy of all of the materials, including the UPC code. Unfortunately, the Rebate center refused to accept a resubmission with a copied UPC label. I am absolutely SURE I sent in the UPC code and I think this is really a ""dirty trick"" to avoid fulfilling a rebate offer. Bad form, Logitech. Really bad form. I have purchased my LAST Logitech product."
1,"poor focus, don't buy this webcam","I liked the look of this webcam, it's features as far as special effects but the image would not focus unless it was about two inches in front of the lens. Contacted logitech and they told me to do the same things I had already tired with no luck. I had read a few good reviews so I thought this would be a good camera but was very dissapointed. I then did a search and found many reviews of poor focus with this webcam.. Amazon has a great return policy inwhich I used and the bought a microsoft webcam that I am very happy with, my son and I play Tiger 09 Wii online and video chat with this webcam and have a great time. I thought logitech was better than this, I will do more online reviewing next time before I make my next purchase."
2,It's later on you find the real problem,"The webcam seemed plenty adequate for what I was using it for. But my PC crashed and I lost my driver for the cam. I went to Logitech's website several times to try to find the driver but could not. I wanted to contact the company for via email for help, but was not an option. When a company makes it difficult to solve customer issues, the company is no good in my book. I'll never buy another Logitech product."
4,very good,Much improvement over older video cam....okay in low level light but def. not HD. Still bang for the buck a good buy.
3,logitech 2 MP webcam pro 9000,not better than any webcam with computer....i highly recommend that one should buy a computer with webcam rather than buying this one...i am not impressed with picture quality at all... if you want to buy buy cheapest webcam ..as they all are samo samo.. that said look for a computer or laptop with built-in webcam..
1,Second 9000,"This is my second. Bought a month ago here, after good experience (on Skype and Vista). This one was discounted 20$. I tend to think that the batch may have been F quality. It is blurry, does not focus nor autofocus right (leaving front objects muddy, uneven sharpness), too dark (also with Right Light, Windows 7, dual core processor, 1280x720 software assisted) - all compared with the one I bought a year ago. Could not make it better, even with a lots of light or manual brightness. My first one still works fine. Big disapointment."
4,Very Good.,"The resolution is amazing and so is the ""Rightlight"". Only negatives are that the video blurs when you move too fast; and the ""Universal Clip"" doesn't seem all that secure. But all in all this has to be one of the best webcams out there."
5,Elegant design,"I can't say much more than the five stars across the board. It's an example of great design: simple, stylish, yet very effective. It fits well on the top of my laptop screen. And the price was great."
4,Nothing special except a good web cam,"Nothing too sophisticated. It works as expected and is worth the money. It was really easy to setup and use. It works great with Skype, Logitech Vid and other video communicators. The software makes all of the commuicator tools readily available. I was really impressed with the software. I'm long-time Logitech fan. They make quality products and this is one of them."
4,Works great,Great buy. My only complaint is that the autofocus seems a bit too sensitive. People on the other end tell me picture and sound they receive is very good. Have not used all of its features but so far so good.
5,Great Buy,I have had other cameras but this one tops them all. It's as if I am standing next to the person I have on the screen. I recommend this product highly !
3,not so clear,"It is nice to be able to see the family that is 4 hours away but the claity and color leave something to be desired. I can see myself very clear but on the other end not so much. I believe if you use the brightest light directly under or around the persons face it does help. But, this product does not measure up to what it says it does. Sorry Logitech.Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 (Black)"
2,logitech pro 9000,"HELLO I BOUGHT FIRST PHILIPS WEB CAMERA DO NOT BUY!!!THEN I GOT THIS LOGITECH PRO 9000 I WAS REALLY HAPPY BECAUSE I SAW SO MANY GOOD REWIEVS ON ALL WEBSIDES.I AM USING SKYPE .MY COMPUTER IS 3.4 2GB MEMORY 300GB HARD DRIVE AND USING SKYPE I DO NOT LIKE IT THE QUALITY IS NOT RELLY GOOD SOMETIMES WHEN I AM TALKING IT FREEZE THEN WHEN I WANNA USE THE FUNNY FACES OR THIS STUFF WHAT THEY GAVE WITH DRIVER IT ISNOT WORKING PROPRLY THE GLASSES SPOSE TO E ON MY FACE BUT TEY ARE NOT.THERE IS ALSO PROBLEM SOMETIMES WITH SOUND,WITH USB IS OK,BUT WITH FACE TRACKING ALL THE TIME PROBLEMS AND QUALITY IT IS NOT GOOD FREEZES ALL THE TIME"
4,Satisfied,"Easy setup and excellent image quality. The effects that come with the software are fun, but the baby is creepy. Overall an excellent choice."
4,"Great Web Cam, less options",This cam has noticable clearer and smoother video quality than the lower models. But it has less options such as the cam cover that slides over the front of the cam and the ability to physically rotate the web cam up/down/diagonally without having to move the monitor or reset the web cam.But this thing is great for skype and I am very happy with the purchase. I returned two of the logitech delux for these and they were worth it.
5,My first webcam is a winner,"Never saw much need for a webcam, I guess I'm just too old for such gadgets. Then my daughter went off to college and I decided I needed to see her smiling face a little more often. So I did a little quick research and decided this unit would be worth a try. Installation on a Vista machine was quick and painless, and we were up and running in minutes. Picture and sound quality is very good. Paired it up with Skype and had a video chat going in no time. I really love this, and now wish we could do this with all our extended family. The microphone works so well, it's even great just for regular phone calls. I use it often with Skype to talk to my parents, and they say the sound quality is great."
3,Best camera I have,"The Carl Zeiss lens should speak for itself. The video quality is very good and the setup is easy ( for vista ).The only flaw I can think of is that during skype, the video freezes for few seconds at time. I assume this can be resolved through a firmware upgrade but I'm too bz to do it.Overall, the experience was great. Highly recommended."
3,"Flawless support in Linux, so-so image quality","After reading all the installation problems that Windows users are having, I was surprised when I just plugged this into my Linux box and a /dev/video device appeared which any Linux webcam software will recognize and use.The camera however is not very sensitive and the 720p resolution is a little optimistic. In average daytime indoor light, there is a lot of chroma noise (streaks and splotches of color) and the shutter speed is slow enough to cause enough motion blur to make people unrecognizable when they're walking past it. As light levels fall, it gets much worse. The image also looks soft and oversharpened causing outlines to jump out, as if Logitech was trying hard to generate 1280x720 resolution from something less. The corners are simply blurry.But this IS an inexpensive webcam, not a professional video camera so overall this is good deal."
5,great webcamera,"This is the best webcam I've had.. You cant beat the price/quality you find in this product! The program that comes with it is also very good, you can take pics and make videos HD with it :)"
5,Works with Linux!,"I like this webcam. It's work with Linux, too. Easy to install, the voice and picture quality is very good. You can take on the laptop or take on the table or everywhere where you want! Perfect for skype."
1,Won't work with Windows 7 64 bit OS,"The title says it all. I have Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit operating system running on an Intel i7 920 processor. Logitech's camera software will not install correctly. You can't get a picture at all. I spent over an hour on the phone with Logitech Support and also corresponded via emails. The net effect was no help. Their software gives Script Errors, Not Win32 application errors, and it thinks I am running an AMD 32 bit processor. Don't buy this product for use on an Intel Windows 7 machine. I does not work. I will work fine on the obsolete XP operating system that I no linger own.Aric"
4,I love this camera,"My daughter lives and I are separated by 700 miles and we talk everyday now we can see each other as we talk using the Logitech 900 web cam. I've looked at many cams and decided on this one due to other reviews I had seen. The quality of pictures and video is truly wonderful! It can adjust to most any lighting scituation automatically; amd the delay is minimal. Only issue is that I wasn't able to load it on my older PC. Even my laptop is somewhat dated and both are running Windows XP, however I could never get it to work on my PC. It works perfectly on my laptop."
4,Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000 fit the ticket,"Though not very knowledgeable about webcams, Logitech's Quickcam Pro 9000 seemed to have the quaility level and features I wanted. Once it arrived it was easy to install and though a few settings were a bit of a challenge to find in Vista, it was up and running relatively quickly.I would recommend this product and even offered to purchase it for both my sisters so that we can chat on line and see each other with Skype."
2,Problem with Skype,"Been using this for a few days and when it works it has very good image quality. Unfortunately, I use it with Skype and the webcam freezes after a few minutes. I've looked on-line at both Logitech and Skype forums and it appears to be a widespread issue with this camera... no solution and both companies blaming each other and apparently doing nothing about it. Until it's fixed, I would not recommend this camera to anyone wanting to use Skype..."
5,Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000,"Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 (Black)As advertised, quick and easy install and setup, clear picture and sound, fun and easy to use. Excellent value for the price, got one for kids so we can stay in touch with the grandkids. It even works for the IT impaired elder generation:)Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 (Black)"
4,Great WebCam,"I purchased this as a gift for a relative so that we could communicate online. I have an older Logitech cam which works very well, but this new one is even better. It's noticeable improvement is in its improved mike and, most of all, its faster rate of screen transmission. Motion captured by this cam is still a bit jerky, but much smoother that with my old one."
4,"Good, not great","The only problem I have with the camera is that it will randomly go way out of focus, and then re-focus. I have worked around it by turning auto-focus off, but it is kind of annoying. Other than that, no problems."
5,Excellent product,The webcam was very easy to set up. The picture quality is very good and the built in microphone is excellent.
4,Good product,"Pro: small, portable, easy to set up and use, HD video, great video qualityCons: Frame rate has trouble; there is a delay in signal transmission, and if the other party is talking, you cannot see the mouth muscles moving real time.Beware!! Logitech responded to my rebate form with ""Invalid UPC code"". I cut and sent the original UPC to them, so I don't know why they did that. There is no way to contact their rebate customer center to ask why. If they say NO, you're screwed. No recourse. $20 is not much, but why lure customers like that? Shame on Logitech."
5,Amazing Image Quality and works on Ubuntu,"Since my last webcam is nearly 5 years old, I hoped that upgrading would be a big change. It was definitely a huge change in picture and audio quality. Whether it is being used for recording video and audio to send to someone or capturing live video and audio for someone to see, this thing does it really well.I currently use it with my laptop which has Microsoft Windows Vista Home premium on it. I've also used it with Skype on my desktop that is equipped with Ubuntu 8.04 and it worked on 8.10. On Ubuntu, Skype has issues with how it can display the video as well as the other persons, but the video does work. As a side note for potential Ubuntu users, when Skype is using the audio and video of the webcam, it disables the use of playing music from your hard drive but allows you access to music/video from the web, youtube, last.fm, etc.I'm 100% happy with this camera and would request it to anyone looking for a great webcam!"
5,Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000,"Easy to Install. I like the software.monitored easy to view I was reported excellent quality video,,,mike works very good too.every adjustment at hand all the time ...zoom auto or manual very convinient. I recommend this webcamera...money worth.we used skype. no complaints at all."
4,Logitech 9000,"Overall, a quality product; however, I needed Logitech help when VID did not install properly on my PC using Vista Home Premium. It eventually worked after several installs and uninstalls. Great picture quality. Logitech help was excellent."
4,"Excellent quality, buy it at a discount","I connected the Logitec Pro 9000 a couple of weeks ago, according to the instructions, but have not yet figured out how to get the microphone or the speakers to work with windows xp and Skype. Son and granddaughters are impressed with the picture quality and the way it works with varying light conditions, and they have access to a speaker phone on their end, which we do not, which means my wife and I have to take turns on the land line,from Wi to Ca, which pretty much limits the whole idea of Skype. He has the same product, with the same limitation. If we can ever get the sound problem figured out, I would probably rate the product a 5 star, but Logitec needs either a live help-desk or better instructions to make this an easy plug and play product, or it is a narrow 4 star product."
4,Great cam for Skype,"I like this cam - easy to set up, great for skype. I do have a problem with the constantly fluctuating pricing - I overpaid for this item, and here I am less than a month later with nearly ten bucks less on the price tag. I feel cheated."
4,Execellent Camera system for the web,This is an excellent camera for linking corporate executives to the web.I was assigned to specify cameras and install them for our CEO and head of HR.The instructions were straight forward and installation easy!I am not even in IT!Hat's off to Logitech!
4,Excelent product!,"The product is an excelent acquisition, the quality of the images is fantastic. The universal clip really works and you can use the camera in diferent computers. As a negative point, I should mention only some problems of interoperability between the built-in software and Skype. Some interesting features, like the tracking of movements, which works well in the bult-in software, doesn't work in Skype."
5,It's worth the money.,As a first time buyer on this webcam I must say you get a lot more features than is what is stated. The things you can do with this camera is awesome. I am still finding out all the items and features this webcam can do. So far I have not seen any flaws or problems with this webcam. You do not need an up to date compuer to make this work on your home computer. I have a computer that I bought in 2004 with a Pentium 4 Processor 520 with HT Technology (2.8GHz) and 2GB of DDR2 SDRAM.
3,"Video works great, but microphone gets feedback",I think it is a design thing. The microphone is on the side and my speakers on are each side of the monitor. I had to really tweak the speaker and microphone settings. I also moved my speakers to cut down on feed back.
4,buy it now!,"Can't believe I waited so long. There's no reason whatsover to feel intimidated by this technology. Out of the box and working in minutes, literally. Just the look on my mom's face when she talked to the grandkids was worth it. Logitech has never disappointed!"
3,Missing the Classics,"The video software that comes with Logitec is ok and fancy but it is missing the most basic things my camera had in 2005 like having a static picture in the background. What? Yes I been trying to do this so simple thing I want a false background while talking on my webcam I seen this in other cameras since they had cameras. No where in the software does it let you do this and the software is for several of their cameras.[Can] I set a background image for the normal webcam view? I want to put a false background while talking so everyone isn't starring at the books on my shelves or the photos on my wall. I've seen it done with some cameras but want to know if its possible with the Logitech Fusion Series camera?They answered.That would be a function of your IM program...not a Logitech issue.Thanks.Seriously, what the hell do I need to look like a baby or a moon face yet I can't change my background. The big L doesn't stand for Logitech."
5,Far superior to stock Notebook webcams,"I purchased this webcam to make Skype video calls from Iraq. Compared to the stock webcam on my notebook, this was incredible. The picture that this cam produces is clear and fluid in most light levels, even when the only light is my monitor. The webcam does well even on slow internet connections. I plan on buying another for my wife to use back home, and at $55 ($65 now) it is a great value. The cam mounts well on top of my laptop, just had to fiddle with it to find the best angle. If you are looking for a modest upgrade, this is it."
4,Good bang for the bucks,"Good value. Easy to install. Straightforward instructions. Encountered no installation issues to be concerned about, from my perspective. Using on an XP machine with great success (3 weeks and counting). Haven't tried with W7 yet but imagine it should be OK. Works well with Skype. Well constructed with great picture quality."
5,no complaints,"this product has work exactly as it is supposed to, load the software, plug it in and it works, first time, amazing."
4,NICE webcam,"This is a high quality, easy-to-use piece of tech. It even comes with simple software you can use to record videos and take pictures. The mic sounds good enough to do basic recording. Since I am only using it to post guitar videos on YouTube (look under GuitarMojoMan), it's perfect for me."
3,not so good,Does not have a lens cover!Exposes the lens to dirt while handling the camera unless stationary.
3,Not Bad,"Amazon was great , I had to return the first web cam, it was determined by tech support that it was defective. Amozon sent a new one out fast, but as far as tec support from logetic I thought was terrible. I got nothing but a big runaround from logitec, talked to three tech. rep's and got three different stories, I really was pissed with the B.S. i was getting from them."
3,"Nice, but a bit broken","The webcam works well enough, it does what it's supposed to do, and that is video chat, and it does that very well.However, most of the extra features regularly break and force me to reinstall the software if I want to use the avatars and amusing graphics. I've yet to figure out how to fix these problems without having to pop in the install disc again.A nice webcam, but worth $70? I doubt it."
3,3 stars based on packaging.............NOT THE WEBCAM ITSELF!,"This webcam will be a 2012 Christmas present for my son so we have not used it yet.Although all the contents seem to be intact in a sealed plastic bag, it did not come in a Logitech (brand) package. It's just the contents of the package in a sealed bag.I am guessing this is Amazon's ""Frustration Free package Design"". I did not choose this version, nor does it show anything different on the screen when you do choose it. I would have liked it to be in the original box since it will be a gift."
4,Great webcam,PROs:I bought this cam from Amazon in 2008. Been using it ever since. Picture quality is great. I primarily use it for Skype to chat with family abroad and quality is great (Skype needs around half to 1Mbps upload bandwidth for a good experience) Built in Mic is also better than most headphone type mics. Colors even in dim light are close to actual.Its been yanked down by the kids and fallen off few times. I've used it on the road. but its still going strong after 4yrs of use.CONs:The autofocus is a good feature but its more of a gimmick really as my cam often zooms in and out to try to focus. Best to turn it off using Logitech's drivers.I hope the new model that kind of replaces this cam is as good & reliable as i'm thinking of getting another one for the road as most laptop built-in cams dont come close to its picture quality.
2,Ok Cam...,"This webcam is ok if you don't mind a mediocre picture. Also, the sound quality isn't much better. It makes you sound like you're in a deep well and your speech is muffled. It would often have difficulty functioning in programs that required a cam. I would not recommend this cam."
4,not so great or bad,is good quality video affordable sound quality isn't as great software that it brings sometimes wont work or crash while usage of cam
4,"Great Cam, no more echo problems!","No more audio problems. That terrible echo in video chat is gone. Picture quality is great and low-light is better even without RightLight, which can make your video choppier."
4,Small business user,Everything about the 9000 is very good EXCEPT the mounting base. Will not fit on my monitors securely otherwise I would rate it at 5 stars
4,Webcam,"This is my first webcam, so I don't really have anything to compare it to. However, I'm a real beginner and it was easy for me to install and use."
3,Automatic Features do not work,"The software surely needs a lot to be desired. Had been having a lot of trouble with flickering of the image. Finally figured out that one of the settings had to be set to ""Do not use automatic Rightlight settings"" to get a flicker-free image. Why provide automatic settings which provide terrible image quality?Also, this is the only hardware, which when connected to one of the USB drives on my computer is not recognized (although it seems to work). The main problem it causes is that it is hard to safely disconnect the USB drive when the computer does not even show that it is there"
5,Nice webcam,"I am very pleased with this product, and would recommend it, it has been very handy to be able to communicate with our family out of state. Thank you."
4,Web Cam,"This is a great web cam. Very pleased & the Amazon price beat everyone else.A Weber, Prescott, AZ"
4,"Great picture, software is terrible","we ended up just using the skype software and that works fine, but the software from logitech is POOR. good thing is, that's the only con. It's great otherwise.The novelty of the camera wears off pretty quick if you're using it to keep up with loved ones, but it's still handy when it's been a while since you've seen someone."
4,Good cam,"I bought this product to have a cam on my laptop. It was very easy to install. I played around with it a bit, checking the program and such. I love it. The clearness is wonderful."
5,Excellent,"After seeing the reviews about how the Logitech software for this product sucked, I only downloaded the driver and use Skype to control the camera. It was easy to install and easy to use. Great picture quality."
4,"First webcam, works great","Had some issues at first with Skype, the main reason for buying this. But after getting the latest DirectX installed, it worked fine. Not sure if it can be used as a security webcam but it does have some pretty nice software that enhances the image -- pretty wacky, some of them, to the amusement of the viewers! It's been working great for the past 3 months and I have no complaints."
4,Great webcam,"I recieve this webcam a couple of weeks ago and hooked it up to my desktop, it work flawlessly, so farthere seem to be no problem communicating with family across the world, the video is clear, audio is good.setup was a breeze, a 2 year old could do it. I would recommend this webcam to anyone as a first pick, the price is resonable."
2,Nice camera not for Vista,"Nice camera,but has issues with Vista, totally locked up my computer, using all memory and I have 4 gigs. Did uptates, no support gave up.I am tired of paying money an not getting help with a product. If it don't work its going back and thats what happened here."
4,certainly good,"I purchased the webcam for my daughter (19) who owns a laptop running Windows Vista and who tends to skim installation directions instead of read them. She failed to disable her virus software during installation so the installation failed. We uninstalled it, and I reinstalled it with her while taking the time to read the unlengthy easy directions. It worked fine, but she complained that her computer kept freezing before recordings were completed. I asked her what other programs she was running at the same time. She was running a few nonessential ones. I told her itunes might be the culprit since itunes had almost destroyed my older computer last year. If she turns off itunes, the webcam records just fine. If I personally wanted a webcam, I would buy this one.It was a bit unclear and counterintuitive how the mounting clip works. It basically just sits balanced at the top of the laptop. It doesn't ""clip""."
5,Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000,"Love this. I bought 5! One for myself and 1 for each of my children. My oldest son has 2 small children and 2 of the others are expecting babies soon. They will all get the QuickCams for Christmas. Soon we can all see ""all the babies"". How much fun that will be."
4,Nice webcam for macs,"I bought this for my mac - it has amazing video quality and sound. However, it only can be used for video/screen captures because it has no drivers for mac. You could by the mac compatible version but personally, it's not worth the extra 30 dollars."
1,Not for use with Skype,This webcam doesn't work with Skype or at least I gave up after hours of trying. I've read through all the reviews on Amazon looking for tips and visited Skype's BBS and all the hot fixes from Skype and most recent versions of software from Logitech don't seem to help.This camera has a great picture as long as you use the Logitech software that comes with it. But when connecting to the camera via Skype I get nothing when calling.The only time I see a picture in Skype is when I use the Tools/Options menu to adjust the camera. It clearly works in the test window but I don't have anything during a real session.I didn't contact Logitech support due to the headaches reported by others here when that's been done. Logitech refuses to support this hardware when used outside of their bundled software. I could care less if I can make my picture look like it was taken in the 1970s I want to call my sister in Boston.Funtionality trumps gimmicks.
3,An OK camera,"The Lohgitech QuickCam Pro 9000 does perform well, but it does not merit all the hype that the sales pitch does around it. I replaced my older Logitech Chat webcam with this Pro 9000 expecting to get clearer pictures, minimize the frozen parts when we talk to Skype partners, etc. It is not doing a better job than my old, simple Chat camera. I am not going to return it, if only for the convenience of self-focus and zooming and low-light adjustment. (In my old cheap camera I had to do it manually.) All in all, this camera is an ""OK camera"", but a bit too expensive."
5,Excellent Webcam,This webcam is excellent. Very affordable. Excellent clear video & pictures. Adapts to laptops and has nice software to work with. Can also be used with other webcam programs. Easy setup for MSN and Yahoo video conference calls.
5,Great performer,Have had this product for almost 2 years now. Until the come out with true HD I'll be staying right here!
4,Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000,"We are very happy with the Logitech camera. It provides excellent color and picture clarity. It is just what we need to keep up with our granddaughter's growth 1000 miles away. An excellent product, we'd recommend it highly."
5,Web cam,Video cam works as advertised. Arrived promptly and was simple to use and install. I certainly would recommend the Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 (Black) and seller.Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 (Black)
5,Great Picture Quality,I have several webcams including the one on my laptop. But the parties I called suggest the image quality on the logitech was picture-like showing clear details and was far superior to that of the others. This product is definetely worth the extra $$. The built-in microphone works great too. I no longer use my headset when making a Skype call.
5,Super and super easy,"It worked great out of the box. Used Windows messenger, and it worked fine the first time. The quality is fantastic."
5,Logitech Pro 9000 Webcam,"I recently purchased the Pro 9000 and it had ease at installing it and wonderful quality in the lens, recommend this camera to everyone!"
4,great product,"easy to install and setup, quality of picture is very good.it also keeps us ""closer"" to the grand kids."
3,Beware before you buy,"I installed the Quickcam software and my computer slowed down and crashed. I tried to uninstall the program. The program would not uninstall itself. After hours of sheer exhaustive detective work (with a wee bit of help from Dell), I found the problem. Turned out that one of the files was duplicating itself hundreds of times, eating up resources and crashing the system. A Google search prompted me to download a file fix from Logitech. It is abhorrent that Logitech has this product on store shelves that is so faulty and contains an old version problem disc. So, finally got it working after way too much frustration. The Right Light Technology function is overrated. The lens is fairly good which was the reason I decided on this cam. The avatars work poorly. The instruction manual explains almost nothing."
3,Updating Software Screws Up Picture for Me,"After I installed the software, the camera worked beautifully. Then a little window popped up asking me to download an update. I did and my picture changed to a foggy, colorless, striped, almost unrecognizable one.I uninstalled the total package, reinstalled, and the picture was OK again. However, every time I started up the computer a nag screen came up urging me to download an update. I just closed the nag screen and ignored it for about a month. Then I decided to try downloading the update again. Maybe I did something wrong and it would work OK this time. Nope. Same lousy picture after installing the update. You might want to try installing the download update to see how it works on your computer. If it screws up your picture, uninstall everything and reinstall the original software. After that, you will do best to ignore all offers to update the software. Just a warning that you might appreciate."
5,QuickCam Pro 9000,"well made webcam. impressive image quality. most suitable for non mobile users. for road warriors, buy the logitech quickcam pro for notebooks. does not work well with latest version of skype. tried on 3 different machines running xp. will lock up computer. works great with yahoo messagner and windows live messanger. windows live messanger has the best free video calling platform at this time."
5,works with ubuntu,"webcam works with ubuntu (and probably most linux distros). I'm running gutsy and had to reinstall the drivers (uvcview) for the cam to be found, which wasn't a problem. The webcam is more than good enough for ekiga. Plus, ekiga works well with windows messenger 5.1, which is included in XP."
4,Great Product,"I definitely think this is a great product. The Right Light technology works great along with the face tracking. I have experienced echo almost every time I use the camera; however, this can be solved by both parties wearing head phones. The face accessories and avatars are cool. The avatars can't quite keep up with your speech. All in all a great product. The Quickcam Pro for notebooks is also a great product."
4,Great Quality but XP Audio Issues,"The image quality is superb, but I've been having audio configuration issues with the webcam. It has a built-in USB mic and when you install your system with the defaults, the microphone settings in XP become problematic. The app assumes it is the only mic in the system. Consequently, I lost all mic inputs and would have to reboot to correct it. I found that removing the app from the system tray helps. Nice webcam, but I hope they improve this mic integration issue. Better yet, it would be nice to install it with video only!"
4,Outstanding WebCam Experience,"I have zero experience in using a WebCam and was pleasantly surprised at how easily I was able to install it. Both visual and sound clarity are extremely good.I am not the greatest mechanical marvel and it took a while to figure out how to hook the WebCam to the top of my computer screen. The instructions could have been better for this simple task.The only real difficulty that I had was in getting the volume to work. However, being a guy, I did the typical guy thing and did not read the instructions clearly as I should. Once I did, it was a breeze to get that volume working.I was so impressed with it, I purchased an Identical WebCam for my wife's computer. Since we are apart a great deal on weekdays and nights, we now communicate this way instead of using our cell phones."
5,First webcam,"This camera is delightful. As a first time user, I made a great choice. Super easy to install. Quality of image and sound exceeded my expectations. I am delighted with this product."
5,Excellent camera!,"This is the first webcam I've ever bought, it was recommended by a friend. I use it with Skype and it's extremely user friendly. It was functional within minutes. Very easy to install, easy to use, excellent video quality. Much higher than anyone else's I've seen!"
4,excellent webcam,"Bought a total of three Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000's, one for me and one for each of my two daughters. They were easy to setup. The picture and sound quality are outstanding. We use Skype for our connection and have been very satisfied with the results."
5,Excellent Webcam,"As a Professional Photographer, I selected this Webcam because of the lens.Sharpness is one thing that I put in my mind before my purchase.My evaluation for this Webcam is excellent."
3,Great quality but not sure about appearance,This webcam has great quality in both video and sound. The mic is sensitive enough to pick up voices from far away but also block out background noises if you are close. I also comes with software that can do all the little extra things to the video a Mac can do. My only warning is that this isn't a laptop webcam. It doesn't have a clip to attach it to the screen and the size is kind of bulky.
5,Great Cam,This is an excellent webcam. The quality of video and audio is great. It entirely satisfies all needs of any home user.
4,Works with Windows 7,"Initially, we had issues with the camera installation but turns out that it was due to problems with the computer not the webcam. After going through a full recovery (to factory settings) with the computer, the camera installed quite easily. We haven't had a chance to do a complete test with a video call to grandparents overseas but things seem to be working fine. Image is clear as is the sound.Original review - I just purchased this webcam because (1) of all the positive reviews and (2) it was the only camera in the store that specifically indicated ""Works with Windows 7"". After nearly 2 hours of struggling on my own to install and get this webcam to work, I called Logitech tech support. And after an hour on the phone with them, the webcam STILL does NOT work. I'm now expecting a call back from their Level 2 support. So I'm hoping this review will save some of you from the frustration I'm feeling right now."
4,Really pretty pics,"Using extensively/exclusively with Skype and really only use the cam feature although it can do a ton of stuff. Install quick and simple (WinXP; haven't tried it on my MACs yet) but I can't figure out why once I make the color adjustments it never saves them. Every new conversation starts out with me waaaay overexposed and I need to make the same corrections over and over. Simple but ridiculous. Most callers don't like the audio of the built-in mic so I use a headset. Auto-follow and auto-focus functions will make you queasy.Kind of expensive for the single function I use it for, but the image quality is great and that's why I bought it."
4,Good hardware quality and software features,"Logitech just readjusted its branding tactics. This popular model was moved from QuickCam to Webcam camp. The product itself does not seem to have changed.The hardware specifications are impressive, with a high resolution and Zeiss lens. These features used to appear only in very expensive models such asLogitech QuickCam Orbit AF Auto Focus System (Black). Therefore, the Webcam Pro 9000 can be considered a bargain even though cheaper competitors abound.I use my Webcam for Skype, so 2.0MP is somewhat an overkill. Getting a Logitech, however, ensures the peace of mind in knowing that the software will work. Indeed, it installs without a hitch on both XP-32 and Vista-64. The only annoyance is that ""window blind"" feature sometimes comes on automatically, but it can be turned off in a few seconds. Overall, this is a good high-end web cam for the average users."
5,Logitech continues to make the best web cams,"I have owned 4 Logitech web cams over the last 3 years and remain very happy. The new Logitech Pro 9000 is the 2nd best web cam by Logitech, surpassed only by the Orbit with a tracking function. I also own the Orbit which I use as my primary webcam.The Pro 9000 offers a superb choice for a compact webcam with a 2.0 megapixel sensor and great picture quality. The Pro 9000 is my choice for my laptop when traveling. The Orbit I use when at home working on my desktop.There isn't much to say other than this is one of the best web cams online. I have tried other brands like HP and Creative. While other brands are improving with newer models, Logitech continues to be the brand to beat.If you want a great webcam that is compact enough to travel with, and don't mind spending top dollar, then this is a great choice that is difficult to beat. Simply read the other reviews and you will be certain that the Pro 9000 is a top performer."
4,Logitech QuickCam 9000 Excellent choice for Dell and Vista,"I bought one of these for my Dell Inspiron 1501 running Vista. I needed a microphone for Skype. The webcam is a very nice bonus. The software gives the user a picture to use if video is not desired. Muting the video turns off the microphone. It works well with Skype. The Carl Zeiss optics do give nice quality. The included software allows modification of the video quality and superposition of cartoon clip art. Cartoon avatars can be used instead of the camera video. The webcam mounts conveniently with its tail prop. Since it is a USB device, it need not be attached and mounted when not in use."
3,Web cam problems,"I have reviewed this once before.I'm sure this is a good product,however I could not get it to work with My PC even after many back & forth E-mails with Logitech.My computer continually went to BLUE SCREEN after each attempt to install.I even followed followed some convoluted instructions from the helpful folks at Logitech.I still do not know whether they knew what they were talking about,or just didn't know how to express it in an E-mail.I finally gave up & sent it back,receiving a prompt refund from Amazon."
2,Will not work with Vista with a TV tuner,"Overall the camera seems ok but it has conflicts with VISTA with TV tuners. I dont know if the same problem will happen with XP and a tuner but with Vista your TV tuner will not work, period. I contacted Logitech for support and they told me that I will not be able to use it due to conflicts with the TV tuner. i wish I had known that BEFORE I spent $100 to buy it."
2,Nice Image Quality -- If Only It Worked,"Nice webcam images and software features. Too bad about half my webcam applications wouldn't recognize the hardware. (I'm running Vista.) I got tired of messing around with the device and decided to buy a Creative Live Optia AF to see if it worked any better. Image isn't quite as good as the Logitech, but it was recognized instantly by all the apps. So I'm sending the Logitech back to Amazon. Oh, and the uninstall program for Logitech software hung up everytime I tried to run it, so I had to manually delete everything. My first Logitech product -- and my last."
4,Excellent video quality as a webcam,"I purchased the Quickcam PRO 9000 after owning a Microsoft Lifecam VX5000 for about a month. The Lifecam was truly Plug & Play and inexpensive, but in the end the picture quality didn't impress. I ended up spending the extra money on the Quickcam and am very happy I did. Picture quality is excellent and also has decent low light performance. I now own two of them, one for my desktop and one for our TV that is used for Skyping family.My only complaint is the slow to install software, it seems invasive in its installation behavior. Lots of churning of the hard drive and waiting. The Lifecam would actually work without installing the supplied software. I'm docking it a star for what I perceive to be inefficient software.I have since had a chance to install this camera after upgrading to Windows 7 x64 bit. It will install without the installation disk and the bloatware that accompanies it. Just plug it in and Windows will seek out the necessary driver."
1,Logitech Software Corrupted Windows XP,Logitech Webcam software corrupted my Windows XP installation. 6 hours later and I'm finally back up and running again. Needless to say this POS is going back !!! I never found out if the camera is good or if it even works at all.
1,I am VERY disappointed,Amazon said that this item worked with macs and it doesn't so i just wasted ALOT of money and am disappointed in amazon for lying to their customers.
1,Not Mac Compatible,"In spite of doing research on Logitech's website before purchasing to ensure that this quickcam was compatible with my Mac IBook G4, it was not. The box clearly states that it is designed for Windows. Too bad.My general view is that the camera looked flimsy."
2,Overated,"I was very disappointed with this product. I did not feel that the picture and sound quality of this product lived up to the ratings that I had read. Purchased, tried it out, and returned it within two days. I would NOT recommend this product to my friends and I would definitely not purchase again."
3,OK FOR AWHILE THEN SLOWLY DECLINED AFTER 9 MONTHS USE.,"I HAVE HAD THIS CAM FOR 9 MONTHS AND IT IS SLOWLY DECLINING IN QUALITY. EACH TIME SOMETHING NEW WITH IT. YES I HAVE READ THE MANUAL, POSTS ETC DONE TWEAKING, UNINSTALLING AND REINSTALLING ON AND ON... I THOUGHT THIS NEW PROBLEM WAS A SOFTWARE ISSUE AND ONCE AGAIN NOPE DOES THE SAME THING... IT WILL BLACK OUT (USING SKYPE) I WILL GET LETTERBOXED AND BLURRED, SECONDS LATER IT WILL BLACK OUT AND BACK THEN TO NORMAL. THE PROBLEM PRIOR, IT WOULD BLACK OUT A LOT AND BACK IN BUT WOULDNT HAVE OTHER ISSUES WITH IT... REVERTING TO THE ORIGINAL SOFTWARE AFTER USING SEVERAL MONTHS OF THE UPDATE DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. THEREFORE IT HAS TO BE A HARDWARE (CAMERA) ISSUE. I WON'T RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE OR BUY THIS ONE AGAIN. ALSO, THE FORCED NEW SOFTWARE UPDATED TAKE AWAY THE SLIDER BARS AND AWAY ONE'S CONTROLS OF THE CAMERA. THE SOFTWARE UPDATE IS HORRID."
3,It is OK,"The product works fairly. However, it is described as ""used, like new"", but I noticed there are some stains on the lens. The product didn't meet my expectation."
5,Really surprised with the quality,"I was extremely shocked about the quality of the camera...I didn't receive ANY feedback whatsoever, no static, nothing. Just my voice and that was it. I actually ended up recording a song with it and lots of my clients assumed I was just using a regular microphone! I was really impressed with the quality not just of the sound but of the picture quality too. I remember having a logitech webcam and it was awful. The picture was blurry, it would skip occasionally and it was terrible but this was amazing. It wasn't as pixelated as the last camera, it didn't skip, it is probably the most amazing webcam I've ever owned =)"
4,logitech webcam,"I have had this particular model for a while and am fairly satisfied with it. It was easy to install, and it's a plug and play. The picture and sound quality are pretty good. I use it with Skype, and have had no problems with this webcam's quality. I have used it for two years now. My only issue is that the webcam's stand is a little bulky for my monitor screen. I have one of these very thin LED ones, and this really stands out. Assuming you're fully satisfied with the design, however, this is a webcam that I would freely recommend."
5,It works..,"It was exactly what I expected. I bought this years ago and just realized I had not reviewed any of my past purchases. This product has run it's course in my home and was donated to GoodWill. It is a good product, but now WebCams seem to be built in computers and usually it comes standard. I would buy it again if I had it all over to do again."
5,Very Good Purchase,Product was as described and arrived in a timely manner. I would recommend this to anyone looking for these items
2,Not up to hype,"I got this camera because it was supposed to be faster with higher resolution. It also had many cool features, some of which I might even use. Unfortunately, it did not work any better than my old $20.00 camera. It was as slow and the picture wasn't any better. The atavars did not work very well and the auto low light setting was better in the off mode. I am back to using my old camera again. Amazon's great return policy stopped this from being a very negative experience. Thanks, Amazon!"
3,WINDOWS VISTA!!!!!!!!!!,"Awsome camera, looks incredible, fits right on top of my Flat pannel etc etc......is HORRILE with Vista....you have to reinstall the driver every few weeks or it begins to freeze up!!! SO ANNOYING!!!"
1,ill-managed company,"I cannot even install the driver. When I call the support, I was told the CD with the package is wrong CD (never heard this kinds stories before). Then I was told to download another version from their site, and the installation cannot go through. Their answer is I need to contact Microsft and Dell. The fact is my PC with XP professional and without problems with other products. When I asked 'May I talk to your supervisor?', I was given a coporate number, funny thing is it is a wrong number again."
5,The best cam I've owned,"I previously owned a Logitech Orbit cam that was 4 years old. While walking with my laptop the cam fell and hit my tile floor ruining it. After reading the reviews on CNet I decided to purchase this cam. I love it! Simple to use, face tracking, low light still looks good, and there are many other reasons why I recommend those of you who are considering an affordable cam to purchase this one."
2,"Camera is great, the software doesn't work, suport is poor","I installed this on my windows XP machine. The camera works great, but the vidio effects and privacy shade software does not work - gives 0x80040606 error. I spent a week with logitech support; re-installing, going through the level 1 lame suggestion list, and just gave up on getting this fixed, because apparently they can't. I find other people with the same problem in their forum. So, if these features are important to you, I recommended not buying this product, as they very well may not work for you either."
4,One of my favorite webcams,"I actually used the Pro 9000 for years because I teach voice online on Skype. It has always been a solid webcam with with nice video quality and decent audio quality. I have a really loud voice so when I used this webcam, I had to use a separate microphone for the audio simply because the sound would distort on the other end because it couldn't handle the pressure. But that is me personally and not everyone will be screaming into the webcam mic.I have since moved onto a new webcam that had a dedicated condenser mic and HD video quality, but that's not to knock the Pro 9000; it was simply so I could have portability and wouldn't have to pack around a real microphone.If you want to chat with your friends, this is the camera to use. It works great and its very affordable. I've recommended it to many many people. In fact, I sent mine to my publishing partner in NY so that when we Skype, I could hear and see him clearly:)"
4,Great Purchase!,I purchased this product so my daughters could talk to their cousins in Florida more than just on the phone. We are using this webcam with Skype and are very happy with it. The picture quality is very clear and the sound is very good also. Very easy installation. I would definately recommend this item.
2,low light problem,"This is a nice vidcam, BUT... it does not work well in low light. I have been using another unit which provides a much better picture under the same circumstances. I returned the unit the day following receipt and I am still awaiting credit for it. It is well over a month since the return, and I am disappointed that it has not shown up yet."
4,Does the Job,"I am hardly an expert as this is only my second camera. I read many reviewed before choosing this one and I can say that mine will just reiterate what has been said. I am disappointed that the sound distorts so easily. The up side is the picture quality is very good. You can adjust the lens from left, right, up and down when zoomed in.Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000"
3,5,"the digi cam is aok, the delivery took over two weeks, unacceptable and wont order from amazon again"
2,Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000,I ordered two of these units so I could communicate with my grandchildren on the east coast. What a dissapointment. Their old cheaper camera worked much better. Neither of the two that I purchased are able to give a clear picture. In daylight the image is washed out and I have to close the blinds and turn off the lights to get a picture worth viewing. I have tried focusing manually and nothing gets any better. They do seem to work in very low light but still the image is out of focus and not sharp. I would not recommend this camera to anyone. My older Logitech Quickcam 5000 worked much much better and was half the price.
3,Not the highest of quality and it wobbles,"I bought this for my laptop and to be used with skype. I found that the part of the camera to balance the camera was not very good in keeping it still or from rocking around. When using it with my laptop you can not move the laptop with this on it because it is not secured, just kinda floating there. The video quality is fine but the still pictures leave something to be desired. I would only recommend this for people who need a cheap webcam but if you can afford it get the HD version and something that can be secured to the laptop."
4,Great Web cam,My only beef is that it did not come with an instruction manual. Had I known this I would have purchased from another seller. That is why it is only a 4 star review.
3,Great Pics - Poor software,"As I'm sure many people have said, this camera provides great, very high resolution pictures. My only complaint is out of the three different machines I have installed it on it has caused serious problems with the functionality of other programs and with the ability to update using the Microsoft website. Everytime I have removed this camera and all its software components from the machine everything goes back to normal. I have looked on Logitech's website and found no fixes - so, great pics, poor software."
5,Logitech Pro 9000,"I have tried 3 other webcams over the past few years and this webcam provides an excellent picture and a wide field of view. The microphone works great too when you have a group of people all trying to talk at once. This often happens in my family when the kids see their cousins in South Africa on Skype and they are all excited. The camera can actually track you face too (if you choose that setting) so, despite natural movements, your face stays centered. The QuickCam Pro 9000 is a great choice if you are looking for a superior picture and great sound quality in a well designed package."
5,"Great Camera, easy to use","The QuickCam Pro has been easy to use and provides great video and audio. I use it to communicate with my Spanish Tutor in Panama, and it has worked flawlessly."
5,Great Product!,I bought this as a Father's Day gift so my parents and I could stay in touch via Skype. Great quality all around. Very happy with the purchase.
4,Logitech 9000 good as advertised,IT was easy to get up & running. People I talk to on Skype says the picture quality is good. Very satisfied with the purchase & of course the purchasing through Amazon was fast & easy.
4,Great cam for the price.,I have had this cam for about 2 years now. The functions are great and easy to use.The only problem is that it is designed to mount on top of the monitor.Picture quality is very good.
5,Great quality,Great quality webcam for the money. I would recommend this to anyone who is using Windows Vista
5,Logitech Webcam 9000,"Bought two of these for family members, my Mom and Uncle because they live 1100 miles apart. Since they rarely get to see each other, I figured these would be ideal gifts, and so far they seem to be a hit. Picture and sound quality are what you would expect from a mid to high range webcam and at the price point they were purchased at they exceeded my expectations.Ease of use is fairly simple, I don't have any problems but the family members who are in their 50's, well, sometimes it takes them a couple tries to get it to work correctly. In all fairness they aren't very seasoned with computers so if they can figure it out then I would imagine it should get a 4 for ease of use.Seems like there could be a few more options/configurations that would help this webcam excel. Overall a great cam for a fair price, would buy again."
5,Logitech Webcam Pro 9000- Black,"With all the webcams available, this one's turned out to be everything I'd hoped for! For the price, the features and quality of picture and quality of construction are superb. Ease of use is top notch."
3,Image Capture Speed: 30 fps,"I bought the camera because it had great reviews. I was looking for smooth video at 30 fps. The camera unfortunatly does not capture at 30 fps, dispite all the ads that say it does... After a lot of reading on the net about it I found that if ya jump thru a lot of hoops it ""might"" be possible to record at 30fps but basically it only does 15 fps and although it is by far the best web camera I have ever used it is still jerky and not smooth... I guess I was looking for a video camera and what I got was a web cam...."
5,Studied all and this was the best for my needs,"Great picture,,,,even in a darken room with one lamp....sound is good for my purposes...very good product and ease of use...works great with Skype."
5,Great product,"Much better than the normal webcam in two ways: 1- the autofocus allows you to move around and show things to others very easily. In the past, with the old 'eyeball' cams, you had to mess with the focus knob to show close ups... no more with this unit ! 2- the width of the field is much wider. Not just a head shot anymore. Now you see you and your desk so you dont have to keep checking that you are exactly in front of the camera. Great for Skype business to business meetings !"
4,Pretty darn good....,I bought two cameras to use keep in touch with my family while I'll be away on a business trip. I chose the camera because of reviews I read on other websites and customers here. I hesitated because several others here shared their installation/operation stories.I have two Vista (don't laugh) based laptops I loaded it on. My older HP zv5000 with XP Pro SP2 had problems with the camera because the drivers from the camera conflicted with the sound card. I still haven't full recovered from the challenges so be aware that SoundMax drivers in older computers might cause error and failures.The image from the camera are sharp and clear. The software can correct most of our lighting conditions (backlighting & low lighting). We used Skype to test out the video calls and it worked really well. I don't have other webcams to compare the experience with but I can say I'm pretty satisfied with the Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000.
5,logitech webcam pro9000,"love picture quality and easy set up, price was reasonable comparatively, would recommend this to anyone as I'm a novice."
4,Logitech 720p Webcam Pro 9000,"I am very pleased with this webcam. It has a built in mic, and enough cord to move it around if needed. Great buy for the money!"
5,Great cam & Mic,"The Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000 gets the job done, very clear pictures with a crystal clear mic . Best thing for me about this cam is the auto light adjustment."
3,logitech quickcam 9000 pro black,"I'm happy with the webcam, The set up was very easy, just as advertised. I am frustrated with the lighting. I thought the ""right"" light sensor would help me with my videos, but I think that's more for the day time. My videos I take during the day are too light, and no matter how much I fiddle with the contrast, or brightness or anything, everything still appears blurry and too light. Nighttime videos are ok,,but I needed to use this for the daytime too. That's the only drawback."
4,"good webcam, software a bit buggy","The quality of the video on a video call is quite good. The camera is good at the highest resolution, a bit grainy on the lower. The software has its issues, the ""motion detector"" does not work and just crashes, you cannot see the buttons in the interface. The effects are funny but sometimes you have to play around to get them to line up with your face. Overall a very good web cam."
4,good quality for the price,Picture quality and mic quality are very good in my option. The web cam is very easy to set up and use except for the two issues I mention below. It is a lot of fun to use. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase.The installation was not quite as intiutive as I would have liked. I can't remember the exact issue now as it was 2 months ago when I did the install. The issue was finding the right site and downloads. Another issue is the mic selection. It seems like I need to reset it almost everytime I go to use the web web call feature.
4,The best logitech camera I've used so far.,Easy setup.Good video quality.I like the new mount/stand.Let's hope they keep the drivers updated on this one for the next couple of versions of MS windows.
5,Great camera!,I had to get a new webcam after I upgraded to Vista. I bought this one and I absolutely love it! The colors are amazing and the clarity is wow astonishing! I use it with Skype and its mostly their problem that it gets kind of grainy but its way better than my old camera definitely recommend it!
3,Great Video - WMV File Format Limits Use,"The product is less useful than I hoped because many of my fiends have iPhones and can not read the proprietary Windows WMV file produced by the Logitech camera so I can't send them email vids. WMV is the only file the Logitech camera can produce and I need MPEG or AVI.Not everyone reads email on a computer these days.Otherwise, the video is great. The audio is mediocre with its built in mike.No problems loading and using on Vista 64."
4,Nice camera,"I have had this camera for about a month now and have had zero problems with it, the quality is good on video and the audio is outstanding. This is the third one I purchased for other family member's and we are all impressed! We use Skype to send the information and have had no problems there either. The only issue we have had is a ""freezing-up"" on on computer and we are attributing that to the lack of memory on that machine because we both have cable for internet connection, if he does not try to do anything else but the phone call all is good."
5,QuickCam Pro 9000,Great camera and easy setup. Took me about 20 minutes and I was talking and looking at my friends and relatives.
5,Simple Setup,The Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 was very easy to install. I literally had it up in running in minutes on a laptop running Windows XP. I was able to use it with Live Messenger without really doing anything - clicked on Video Call and it fired the QuickCam Pro right up.
2,"Good cam, but doesn't work with MSN IM","The camera picture quality is really clear. Works fine until I use it with MSN IM, freezes everytime. Tried it on Skype too and get the same result. It's unfortunate that $100 was spent on it and it doesn't work."
3,"Great quality, poor clip","The quality of this mic/camera combo has been excellent, but the fit-all clip is bulky and doesn't work on my monitor well."
3,web,dont use it any more my new computer came with a built in so its sits but when i did use it is had great picture great quality
4,Great cam,"The Webcam Pro 9000 is the replacement for the old Quickcam Pro 9000 and this new one is amazingly clear.The setup was quick and easy and the software was fairly easy to set.I find the build quality to be great however the software as always was a little lacking...I find the auto focus to be a bit difficult to set on smaller items but then again, you can set it into manual focus mode.Audio quality is just about the same as any other middle priced Logitech cam out there and very usable....although you still need headphones for skype and such.Overall, I would buy this product again any day as It's improved my live stream broadcasts quite a bit as well as enabled me to shoot better video podcasts."
3,Pretty good!,I bought this webcam to see my family back on the East Coast. The camera sits well on my laptop and works well for basic functions of webcam and small clips. It's not a great camera in general but it serves it purposes. Some of the problems concern lighting. I sometimes get some stalls on my comp that only occur when the webcam is plugged in but can't say the actual problem is the webcam vs my memory.Overall for basic webcam purposes it's good!
4,Very good camera.,"Very good product. Works with my iMac intel dual core system (OS X) even though it is USB 2.0 (vs. mac version which only utilizes FireWire). The only downside: it is a little slow, which causes a little bit of a blur when you move around during a video conference. Overall, it is a very good camera."
5,Logitech Webcam Review,"I am very pleased with this purchase.There is significant improvement in the quality of the image over our previous, and cheaper webcam."
4,Works Great Except for Logitech HD Vid Software,"This is a very easy to use webcam with good picture and sound quality. The only problem I experienced was trying to conncect to others using the Logitech HD Vid software. It would not allow us to connect to each other. Had to use gmail instead. Otherwise, great product."
5,A good webcam,"This camera raises the bar for webcams (not very hard!). It has good color, very good light sensitivity, and good resolution. It works well in a high contrast setting, like a bright light in a normal room, and still shows faces clearly. Of course the image quality isn't as good as a real digital camera but it is a webcam after all. The software is quite sophisticated and has some cute features which are fun even though they don't work 100% of the time. It's the best webcam on the market right now and fairly priced."
4,God camera,"QuickCam Pro 9000 produces very good quality video, has a lot of software gadgets. It is a good quality product.You have to be very creative when you try attaching it to the monitor though. It's not that easy as on other Logitech or Microsoft cameras, and you would need to use tapes, sticks, etc. And it is overpriced compared to other comparable cameras. Logitech Deluxe would be my choice as a laptop camera - it is twice less expensive and attaching to the laptop screen is very easy."
4,Webcam,"Camera works great. Still do not have the rebate & am unable to check the status on line! Also, product was shipped USPS with no tracking capability. It took 3 weeks to move 250 miles. Amazon was easy to deal with & supportive."
5,Great product,"Easy to use and set up, kick butt over the last cheap cam I had. Very happy. Clear sound and image."
5,Love This Quick Cam,"Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 (Black)Purchased the web cam so we could communicate with our children and grandchildren who live out of our area. Absolutely love it! Picture is clear, sound is great. Very easy to use. A must for any grandparent or parent who want to see their grandchildren but live a distance away."
5,Logitech Webcam Pro 9000 Review,I bought this product about 4 weeks ago and here's why. The picture clarity is excellent. I also have a MS Lifecam 5000 and the Logitech blows it away. The 9000 also has an excellent microphone as well. It also came in the non-frustration packaging which was nice. The setup was quick easy. I have Windows 7 and it found the camera with no problems and the drivers were already up-to-date. All in all its a fantastic webcam.
5,Great Features and Easy to Use,"I have an older laptop, 2005, so I was a little worried buying an after market camera. This one works great. I use Windows and it has caused no capatibility problems that I can see. The image is great. The audio is great. I purchased a microphone/headset to go with it, but haven't needed it so far. The camera was easy to install and setup. Logitech is the way to go."
5,Very good webcam!!!,I am extremely satisfied with this web camera. The video quality is excellent. Keep in mind that as soon as you start zooming the picture quality goes down but that true for all digital zooms. Great product!!!
5,Logitech QuickCam Pro-9000,"Excellent product, very pleased with it's quality and function, as are my E-mail recipients whom I have sent personal videos---Thank You!---Greg Pontti, GAP Services-HI"
2,I am very disappointed.,"I bought this camera in January but never opened it until a week ago (and it's not past the return policy date). The camera is great, if it worked all the time.There are white lines that come across the picture. I want to describe it as static, but these are vertical lines from the top to the bottom of the picture; completely distorting the view."
5,Outstanding!!,This is a very great product...everything i read about it before i bought it is all true. I really recommend it to everyone.
3,Logitech Webcam Pro 9000,"Brilliant camera. BUT took more than a week to get it working. Required editing of my PC Registry with the help of a Tier 2 tech from Logitech. Some Logitech techs didn't know what to do. Wonderful webcam once it's working, but very, very hard to get it to work. I wouldn't buy it again."
4,webcam wonder,"This is an excellent product. We have 2 sons in Denver and don't get to see them as often as we would like. We decided to buy tehm the Web Cam for Christmas, since one son is expecting their first child next year. The installation of the software was relatively easy. However, we did have a problem with our AOL not allowing the download of SKYPE, which we decided to use as the communication protocal. However a call to ProLogic's tech center was helpful. They just advised me to use Internet Explorer to download SKYPE.It was great seeing our sons and their girls with the cameras. You need to spend some time getting comfortable with the software. But it's fun and relatively easy."
1,Incompatible with Macs!,"I bought this product because I was led to believe that it was 100% compatible with my Mac computer. However, after receiving it, it was discovered that most of the the features claimed for Windows machines were not available for the Mac. Therefore, it was returned."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is the second Logitech webcam I've purchased and it will be the last. I originally purchased this product when I was running Windows Vista and it worked fine. I upgraded to Windows 7 64-bit when it became available. The cam no longer worked after the upgrade. It would not focus beyond about 12 inches of the lens. I searched the internet and Logitech web site and found that this is a common complaint with this product. There are muliple suggested fixes but none of them work. I contacted Logitech but am unable to get a response. I suspect it is because they know their product is defective and have no intention of doing anything about it. I would like to have the web cam replaced free of charge, but the Amazon warranty has expired and Logitech is ignoring me. I had a similar issue several years ago with one of their web cams. I will be looking elsewhere for my next web cam."
4,Great cam,"Great resolution, love the camera. I don't care for the logitech cam software that comes with it, but you don't need that for skype and yahoo. This cam works great with vista 64 bit version."
3,Let Down,"I have always bought Logitech cameras and keyboards because they have always been very reliable products.But I'm afraqid I cannot say that about theLogitech QuickCam Pro 9000 (Black).It does not have the clarity that I am accustomed to from a Logitech camera also it is to light. I have tried every combination of less light, more light, and numerous other things. The camera still remains fuzzt and very light.I would not buy this particular product when looking for a cam. Check out the other Logitech cameras as I have had many of them and always had wonderful results with them."
5,Greate webcam,"I bought this because my old webcam had no microphone and thus I had no sound. I wanted the best and this one got the best reviews and seemed to have the highest resolution.Setup and install was uneventful and the camera and microphone work great. I like the software included which allows you to change yourself into many different animated characters or wear funny things on your head. The software uses face tracking to do this so when you move or speak the characters follow you in realtime.While this is one of the more expensive webcams out there it is probably worth the few extra dollars as overall it really is not expensive.It clipped to my flat LCD monitors without any problem too.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good, better quality webcam. Good job Logitech."
4,Great picture quality,"Once I got the software installed and the webcam working, the picture quality is great. I use with Skype and it is just like talking to my daughter in the same room. I use the built-in microphone and it works well also. This is my first webcam so I don't have much to compare this to. The only bad part of this was that the software that came with the webcam failed during installation. I was able to download a newer version from the Logitech site, but I find this very annoying to have to do that to even get the software to load especially since I am still running XP which has been around a while."
1,Will NOT work with Windows 7 64-bit,"I have spent hours trying to troubleshoot this and it simply cannot get it to work with windows 7 64bit. No matter what, whenever you try use the webcam you'll get an error saying ""Cannot connect"" or ""in use by another application."". I have turned everything off in msconfig and still says the same error. I have uninstalled and reinstalled many times to no avail. The logitech support forums suck. I think i'll be going with a hercules webcam."
5,Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000,"The QuickCam does exactly what I expected it to do. It integrates well with the Polycom software that I use, as well as the Google video chat. Unfortunately it shows too many details of my house in the background - I better clean up."
4,Very nice!,"My first webcam...have learned that not all programs are webcam equal, e.g. AIM is worthless, Skype is great. That said this is a really capable product. You have lots of control over lighting, selective framing and capture, etc. It's really neat."
4,QuickCam is great,"This is the second one I have ordered (one for me and one for my son). They both work well. I have ""Skyped"" with other friends that also bought the same product. They seem happy as well. We have all decided to not use the ""face tracking"" feature. It seems to jump around (zoom in and out) and is distracting."
1,"Problems in Mac, does not work in XP","In Vista ok, but that's it. Claim that this product is supported in Mac is not true any more. In Mac OS Leopard the chat application is the only one that works with this. Yes, there is a ""separate ""product with +$20 extra that has Mac support, but I'm multiuser, not sticked to one OS/computer. In Microsoft XP it works after installation, but once USB connection is once disconnected it does not work any more. The UI is inconsistent with everything else. It's a shame that this high image quality product is limited to Vista only."
5,Great Webcam,"Easy to set up and use. Impressed with the high quality video it transmits, far superior to lower end cameras I have tried. Adjusts well to any lighting condition, makes me look good, I like it.No compatibility problems observed with Vista, or Webex, seems to work well. Logitech has their own software bundle and free sever to host conferencing from, nice benefit, but I almost would have rather installed just the camera driver and let the other applications do the driving. No option for that available. The free use of their server is nice though, just haven't taken advantage of it given my use of existing video application programs."
5,Fantastic Purchase!,"The logitech quickcam pro 9000 is perfect for what I wanted. I purchased two of them to use on skype for home and on the road. Work absolutely wonderful even in poor lighting due to the rightlight feature. The mic is great too. Nice not having to have a separate headset, etc. I would recommend this product to everyone. Pay a bit more for this, but be happier in the end."
5,"This is the Webcam youve wondered ""where have you been all my life""","The best picture from a webcam you will ever get, works fantastic with skype. you will be very suprised with the quality, far better then i expected."
4,Not bad,This is the only web cam i've ever used but i think it's pretty decent. My only gripes are i constantly have to change the settings cause they don't seem to save. Other than that it does a good job. It's clear as long as u have good light and optimal settings for your room.
4,nice product,"This is our first webcam experience. We purchased it based on consumer reviews and the decent price. We bought two units so we can communicate by video with our granddaughters. Through skype software and cable internet connections, the images and sound are as good as we expected. It was easy to install and use. The Skype software is also easy to use. The additional video features make it even more fun and the novely has not yet worn off. We have not had any experience with other webcams or access software for compsrison."
5,Using the QickCam Pro 9000 with Skype,"A couple of weeks ago I ordered this cam, because Skype recommends it of one of the best. It works very well! I also like a lot the in build microphone - it's very clear to understand (that what my friends in Germany tell me). My kids love the gimmicks included in the software.I would buy this camera again!"
3,Easy to setup and use.,"The disk came with the box didn't work well. Need to download window 7, 64 bit version from the Logitech web site. Otherwise, it was easy to setup and use."
5,Great webcam,This was a great buy for me. I like the style of the webcam. It comes with decent software to use with.
1,blue screen of death,This webcam is incompatible with my graphic card software from NVIDIA GE force GT220.I have tried downloading and updating all the drivers..but it still crashes my computer.there are multiple posting on the web with this unresolved problem.. so I have to buy another webcam!
3,Mediocre,"Frame rate is way too low on this device. I guess that applies to a lot of the webcams out there but seriously... I would not have purchased this device if I had known that its framerate is so low. Nevertheless, Skype still works with it. I probably won't buy any webcam in the near future, not until I know for sure that it records at a normal 25fps."
3,Excellent Camera with a Stipulation,"Here is my original review from the time I bought the camera:This product is great. It has the microphone built in, the picture is clear, and I have been so pleased with the performance. It was easy to install as well.It is still true, but after Skype installed a few updates, my camera shut down my entire internet network when I tried to use it with Skype. All of the one-star reviews for this camera cautioned that this camera has that effect, and Skype's official website even says that this specific camera has had problems with Skype.My message to all of you: read the five-star AND one-star reviews before you purchase something; I bought this camera specifically to use with Skype."
2,"Too much lens distortion - ""stretched faces""","I am sending this back as the wide-angle lens distorts too much. Ironically, the image quality is really excellent, even in low light (much better than the Quickcam Fusion). The distortion was noticeable as soon as the video window came up - faces are stretched vertically. The same scene with the Fusion reveals a natural picture (though the image quality - colors, etc. - is not as good as the Pro 9000). It's really too bad."
3,Ok for internet chat.,"What good is good quality video if the sound is most always a problem.It is not that the mic does not work good, it is like it is on level 8 when I turn it down to level one. So may be it works too good for me. Breaks up with any raise of volume. I taped two layers of cotton over the mic and it is still breaking up.Great for basic internet chat though."
4,One-way picture quality?,"I like everything about this camera but for one aspect - which MAY turn out to not be a camera problem.When using SKYPE, the picture I see of the room I'm in is near perfect and the person with whom I'm communicating also sees a perfectly clear picture of my room. The problem is that the picture I see of the other person's room is of very poor quality - which could be because of a poor quality camera on that end - although that person tells me that others she communicates with don't have the problem I see. If it were just a poor quality picture, I would probably just write it off to a bandwidth problem - but in addition to poor quality, there is a 2 1/2 inch green stripe running dead center, top to bottom of the screen. I havn't talked with Logitech yet nor have I tried a connection with another party to see if I get the same results. When I do, I'll update this - if Amamzon's interface will allow it."
1,Logitech Registration,"How has registration ever helped anything but Logitech? Bought it, registered at the first nag-asked for no emails - got bothered by emails anyway. Had to reload windows. Re-installed webcam - again forced to go through registration or live with the Nag.Camera's fine but I resent Logitech's aggression. It's Logitech's hostile reminder that I do not really own what I bought, otherwise I could control it.I'll never buy Logitech again for not giving me the choice to NEVER register their product. Jerks."
3,"Great reviews, OK product","I purchased this to increase the resolution over my old Logitech webcam. Although much better, I have my computer system hooked up to my 47"" television and sit about 12' away. At the zoom levels necessary to not encompass the whole room, the image is very pixelated and poor. For a computer on a desk, it's probably fantastic, but I got the better resolution camera with my situation in mind and was dissapointed."
3,Good Product - Bad Service,The product was well priced and works great. Camera is amazing. However it took FOREVER to ship and arrive. I believe it was over 2 weeks after placing the order I finally received the shipment. Other items on amazon usually show up 4 or 5 days after making order. VERY SLOW!
2,not so good on Vista,"I purchased 3 of these so my wife and I could see the grandkids. My units runs on Vista and when you turn on the camera it changes the display resolution to 640X480 in Black and White. I have tried to call for support but was told it was a computer problm I have uninstalled it and my computer works fine. We can still see the grandkids they just can,t see us."
4,"Camera works very well, just as good as the more expensive ones.","Very good camera, works well, but could fasten more securely to monitor, etc. I use it for Skype and have had no complaints."
4,Good camera,"Camera has great picture you can shoot pics, video, skype and many more. Has some extras in the software for putting different faces on you. Pretty Cool."
4,"Good for Skype, problems with updates","I bought this to use for Skype video phone calls. The software CD that came with the camera allowed me to set very high resolutions. Although the installed seemed to check for updates at the time of install and said no updates were available, the day after I had a popup message saying an update was available. I accepted the 100 MB+ update, and found that it removed all of the high resolution options for the camera. I uninstalled the software and returned to the original drivers. Works great for Skype. The included Logitech Vid is lame since it doesn't have any echo cancellation and I got terrible feedback loops when I tested it."
3,Works with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Skype but Spendy as a Linux Webcam,"Works, but too spendy when compared to its features for use with Linux.I doubt I have any of this webcam's cool features that Windows users have--like zoom, tracking, image technology--but this webcam is UVC compatible. I wish Logitech would include software for Linux so I too could take advantage of this webcam's cool features.I purchased this webcam because my old webcam wasn't fully UVC compatible and wouldn't work reliably with Skype for Linux.After applying a patch/fixing a glitch with Skype this webcam works fine:[...]Basically, as root (sudo gedit /usr/local/bin/skype), with gedit create text file called ""skype"" in /usr/local/bin with the following text in it:#!/bin/bashLD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libv4l/v4l1compat.so /usr/bin/skypeThen change the properties of Skype to be executable ($ sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/skype)."
5,Can't get any better than this..........,"I had no idea what computer camera to buy for my newly purchased laptop so I asked some of my highly respectable computer friends for a recommendation. They advised the Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000. It is easy to install, easy to use and the quality of the video is incredible.Now I know what computer camera to recommend to anyone if i'm ever asked!"
5,logitech,It does everything that was promised - we love it and use it to talk on Skype to our kids and grandkids. Wonderful.
1,Software Installation Problems on XP Media Edition,I'm certain this is an excellent piece of hardware but I never had the opportunity to find out because the software would not install on my Windows XP Media Center computer. The error messages referred to missing dll's which were not on the installation disc. There is no live support and I could not find this issue on the FAQ's. So I am returning this to Amazon.
1,NOT SAFE for allergic people - and white hair turned turquoise,"Having studied pharmacy, I follow instructions religiously. I had an allergy test to henna powder, and since I am not allergic to henna, and they say Logona is pure henna based - so, I trusted it. My white hair turned turquoise and was unable to show up at work without a turban. Also, I got an allergic reaction: the product started warming up and itching lightly after as little as 35 minutes, but I kept it for the entire recommended time, according to instructions. So now I doubt it is real henna, cause Indian-made henna did not cause an allergic reaction to me.I was so happy to try Logona Black - exact same product as listed, brought here - due to the excellent reviews! Now I wonder if some of the excellent reviews were written by the people who sell this product. I am sorry, folks, but this experience has been terrible for me, and I need to worn others - it is my personal and professional duty."
3,not what I was expecting,I ordered this as I have an alergy to reagular hair coloring and this did not cause an alergicreaction however it did not do a very good job of coloring my hair.
4,"Good, not great","There a ton of good recordings of Pictures at an Exhibition out there- and this is one of them.My question is: why by one of the ton? Actually, it is a smart thing to do perhaps, you know you can't really go wrong with this one, but a truly unique an exciting recording is the one on Mercury with Dorati and Byron Janis. On that disc, you not only get a phenomenal, original orchestral version of this piece, conducted by the master, Dorati- but you also get Byron Janis playing the rarely heard piano Pictures, as it was originally intended by Mussorgsky. Also the liner notes on that set is incredible.So, to sum it up, I wouldn't say DON'T buy this one,it is after all remarkably beautiful- but I would ask you to consider if there might be a better deal, with a much more individual sound out there (Mercury!)"
5,Vibrant & Eloquent Performance!,"Each movement thoughtfully paced in broad tempi, Sinopoli gives warmly expressive, eloquent performance of the Pictures. Shifting mood of each section is vividly captured. Brass playing of NYP is absolutely spectacular. Climaxes are powerful and majestic. No doubt one of the great recordings of this work! Coupled with equally brilliant Bald Mountain & Valses nobles."
2,Self indulgence made real,"This recording is pretty hideous. It brings the New York at its egotistcal worst and Sinopoli's hideous view on the music in question.The Ravel sounds terrible as he twist and pulls the music out of shape...making it sound deformed and ugly.Pictures at an Exhibition brings more of the same and the New York ensemble in full ego. Just listen to baba yaga and here the brass and tuba blasting away as if on a football field. In many parts of pictures it seems the brass...1st horn, tuba and trombones in particular...are there to massage their own egos and show off rather than present the music for us to enjoy.A disgusting display of ego and showman ship by conductor and orchestra....and the New York Philharmonic wonder why they arent highly regarded in many circles?It is very clear here.I would advise you to stay away from this disc."
1,Nothing special,"I bought this thinking it would be a huge step above the seaweed you can buy in the grocery store Asian section. It isn't. However, it is infused with garlic. Next time, I'll go with the much cheaper grocery store kind."
2,Amazon's edition is outdated,"As of today, Amazon is still selling the 4th edition, published on January 1, 2007, according to the information on the product page. The publisher's web site, benchmarkmaps.com, shows that a newer edition was published in 2011. I asked Amazon why (via the product feedback links) and got no answer.In case this situation changes, please notify me by adding a comment to this review so that I can delete this review."
5,Good book of Maps of Washing ton State.,We should be able to find our way out of Canada and into Washington State and Seattle quite easily. Maps big and easy to read
4,Some pages out of order,"Just received the map.Pro: The detail level of the map seems great.Con: Flipping through the pages I see ...86, 87, 88, 91, 92, 93... If you want pages 89 and 90 they are printed after, and attached to, page 40: ...38, 39, 40, 89, 90, 41, 42..."
2,Poor binding,"Page 39,40 and 89,90 were not bound into book. Map is well laid out but binding is poor. The atlas will not last."
5,Keep Your Team Members on Track,"I've used the VWAP for years. I know of no other single resource that provides such a thorough overview of the short-term missions experience. It contains great information, exercises, and questions to stimulate thinking. Your team members will be better equipped for their experience if they have this book."
3,A little more effort please!,"I've seen lots and lots of Studebaker pictures over the years and this compilation could've been twice as good with a little more effort. Most of the pictures of the earlier hawks are good, but suddenly at 1962 practically every shot is of a prototype and not the actual car that was produced. One shot of the prototype would've been enough, but instead all we get is a couple of really crude shots of actual production models--and blurry at that! The 1963s and 1964s fare a little better, but I really think this book is only BARELY worth the price. A decent compilation of facts and some detail shots, but uneven in quality, to say the least. There's just NO excuse for making this kind of book and reprinting blurry photos, period."
3,Good,Ilove hazlenut but it is not consistant. sometimes I make it and it is good other times it has a funny flavor not hazelnut taste.
1,Very fast ship!!!! But very disappointed.,"The coffee shipped fast but it taste like garbage, I have never tasted coffee like this. It tasted like re-brewed coffee from 7 days ago. I tasted better coffee from instant, which expired two years ago. Never again will I buy this brand of coffee, very disappointed.Williams, Terrance 2013 APO, AE"
2,Bitter taste. Not like the Hazelnut I'm used to.,"First, this coffee smells like something else is in it besides hazelnut. Not impressed and would not buy again. Sorry."
2,"Great Mouse until it died, then Gyration made me sad!!",Agreed with the other review for about 47 days. At that point the mouse stopped responding and Gyration never has responded. Tried emailing them - they asked when and where I bought it but never responded to my answer. Their non 800 phone service is a bottomless pit. Never did get to talk to anyone even after waiting up to a half hour.
2,Disappointed.,"The purchase of this tablecloth was for the Christmas holiday 2011. Although it was 70"" the over hang was pretty short. I expected it to be a full length over hang (as pictured/advertised) but it was not. I feel this should have been added in the tablecloth's description. The over hang gives a tablecloth the ""wow"" factor to me so I didn't get wowed by this tablecloth. The(poor)quality fooled me also."
1,Color not as described,"The color is listed as Golden Sage. I wanted the sage but when I received it, the color was golden, not sage. Other sites list sage as one color and golden as a different color. The description is wrong and should be fixed. I ordered the sage from another site and it arrived in the right color!"
1,"Awful, poor replacement kit","I have been fighting with my Eljer toilet (what a miserable design). I thought I could fix the setup once and for all with this kit. Unfortunately, that is not the case. so many problems with this kit as detailed here:1) The instructions are terrible, and don't even show you how the handle assembly goes together.2) There is no way for the handle to remain properly affixed to the pull-arm? It just appears to ""push together"" base don the instructions... how is it not going to fall off?3) The new flapper arm has cutouts on it that make it fall off the pivot VERY easily... wtf?The only part I could make use of was the ball for the flush valve... I had to use all the old parts as-is, since they worked better than anything in this kit.A poorly designed kit, with terrible instructions, on top of a poorly designed toilet. I can't wait to get rid of the entire mess."
4,Good Replacement Kit,"Purchased this kit because the plastic flapper mount that is secures to the tank bolts had snapped in my toilet. Was able to remove the tank and install the flapper and mount from this kit without issue. The packaging of this product is very difficult to open. Use care to extract the various pieces. The instructions are minimal at best. For example, the flapper is protected by a plastic housing, but the instructions do not mention removing it. New tank bolt hardware and a new tank to toilet ring may also be necessary."
4,"A day at the ""Zoo""!","Once again Gotthard deliver another quality release. I bought this after hearing Lipservice,which I believe is their finest hour.I have listened to several Gotthard releases,and have not come across a bad one yet.It's a shame that their music is not well known in the states,because they rock harder than the majority of what is called music these days. If you ever listened to TNT,House of Lords,Black'n'Blue,Keel,or Icon,then you this band will take you back to that era.It rocks!"
5,An Unforgettable CD,This is one CD that a classical music lover or historian must have in his or her collection. Get it now before it is too late!!!
2,Slow tempos and a lack of energy--,"this is Bernstein at his most self indulgent. Since the other reviewers all give this performance 5 stars I have listened to this recording over and over trying to find good points. I believe that the last half of the finale -- from ""seid umschlungen"" to the end -- is well done."
2,The longest running commercial,"But one would rather watch the Milk commerical, at least it markets some real stuff and doesn't take 70+ labored minutes. The coalition of the willing was undoubtedly doing a heck of a job in holding its base against various village bands vying for the authority on the same music with a different Ode, and the commander-in-chief barely held its members together. Despite all the Freiheit, it is a freudlos performance."
4,Wonderful,"This performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is the best I've heard. Having to perform it (as a vocalist) in April, I needed a study aide. This is a great one. I have to turn the volume up really loud to get it to a normal volume though."
4,Ode to Freedom,"The poem that Beethoven used for the text of the choral movement of the 9th Symphony is Friedrich Schiller's ""Ode to Joy"" (Freude). It is said that Schiller's original title was ""Ode to Freedom"" (Freiheit) but the the government censors objected. Given the occasion, Leonard Bernstein's substitution of ""Freiheit"" makes perfect sense. I'm sure it did to the Germans standing on the ruins of the Wall. That said, this is a good performance, a bit messy (not surprising given the circumstances) but played with Bernstein's usual conviction and emotionalism. It is a great historical document, much like Furtwangler's 1942 recording, but for totally different reasons."
3,Size does matter!,"This towel bar will work for the space I had intended, but the measurements were misleading. The length is actually longer than 12"" - I guess they get 12"" from the actual length of the bar(s) only and I assumed by the description that the size was 12"" from end to end; the bar did not fit within the inner frame of my cabinet as I had planned, but it was do-able. Also, the item was slightly bowed, but that did not hinder installation."
5,Just what I needed,This was just what I needed for my new kitchen - a bar for my dishtowel and a bar for our hands. It fits at the end of a cabinet near the laundry so it is out of sight. Husband said it is quality made. I recommend this for anyone who needs to hang two towels.
5,Great Product,"This CD is a great production from beginning to end. The highlights are ""dream on dreamer"", ""stay this way"", ""brother,sister"", and a sleeper hit called ""try my love"". It's great music and a great buy!"
3,It's cool,"it's a good product, although this is not from ACIDJAZZ, but the recording is great, the sound is clear. i'm very satisfied with Amazon's services"
1,"Amusing, but weak in accuracy and logic","Proof that when reading history, one should always consider the source. This is one of the most biased pieces of ""history"" I have ever read. I found it ironic that the author attacks the purity of the Queen Mother's Scottish ancestry when he has just spent over one-hundred pages tracing his own alleged descent through numerous Italian and Polish lines.I was also continously amused by his assertion that all historical figures of import are either Scottish or an actual Stuart. He claims Napoleon I as a relative and the late Princess Diana as a fellow Scot (while I'm sure she has some Scots in her family tree, probably no more than the Queen Mother!--see above). This man wants to have his cake and eat it, too, and I feel like this work undermines sincere efforts to celebrate the rich history and culture of Scotland."
1,Sheer Fantasy,"All those who want Scotland to choose a different path from that of England should hesitate before choosing to believe the claims of the author of this book. To cut a long story short, base your policies on fact, not fiction.This book is totally ridiculous, and I'm glad that children have not been taught history from it. There are plenty of decent books on the Jacobites, and this is NOT one of them."
4,Good book but not a popular viewpoint,"I've cross-checked most of HRH Prince Michael James' sources and fact and have found him to be better than most authors of this genre -- about 80% +/- on ""hard"" fact and about 50-50 on questionable supposition. It's a good read and well done; regardless of your point of view on the subject matter. Is it more pride and boast than history? No, but it is filled with patriotic overtones. I'd rate it well beyond the current crop of like books."
2,A semi-useful application aid,"This book is good in that it gives you a nice array of examples in the different categories of questions. However, it doesn't review any of them or give guidelines on what worked and what didn't about each particular essay. Some are extremely long which doesn't coincide with 300-500 word maximum that all the schools I applied to have. Basically, a this is a cheap way to go if you need help breaking out of terminal brain-lock when it comes to writing your essays. Otherwise, I'd shop around. There are much better aids out there."
4,Little Dorrit,"I am fortunate enough to have this on laser disc and while it may not be up to new DVD standards, the quality is still far better than VHS. I would definitely buy a restored DVD issue when it becomes available. I loved this version. I just watched the newer BBC version on PBS. Overall it was very well done but I thought it did a poor job explaining the ""mystery"" at the conclusion. We had friends that could not figure out who was related to whom at the end, and I have heard that PBS received tons of e-mails asking for clarification. It almost came across as if Arthur and Amy were step brother and sister."
4,Well Done,"It is a long and involved story but worth the attention. As with most british films, it is slow going in the begining then works up to a surprising end. Be sure to have both sets of tapes, you won't want to wait to see Part two or Little Dorrits view."
3,Ambitious Dickens adaption on a low budget,"Made in 1987 and boasting a 200 plus cast and essentaially a 6 hour film in 2 parts, director Christine Edzard's adaption of one of Dickens' least read novels is only partially successful. It is told from the point of view of Arthur Clennam (Dereck Jacobi) who on his return to London becomes interested in the case of William Dorrit, locked in a debtor's prison for 25 years and his daughter, seamstress to Clennam's mother. Despite excellent performances and eye for detail part one is very slow moving and drawn out (and one can't believe that after 3 hours, it is only halfway through the story). One has to wait for part 2 for a satisfactory conclusion to the tale..."
2,Atmospheric but looong...,"Judging by the other very positive reviews here I am in the minority when I say this was heavy going. Watching this has actually served to put me off Dickens! The video undoubtedly captures the atmosphere of the times, but the story is sooo weak and cliched with characters and events that seem unbelievable even for a Dickens work. Characters were too nice or too nasty and came into and went out of money just a bit too conveniently for me to swallow. For diehard D fans only I think."
3,Not a bad game,"My girlfriend and I played this game and found that, though it has nothing to do with the Simpsons, that it isn't half bad. I agree with other reviewers that the question cards are the most interesting part of the game (how did she know I don't like Pork Rinds?), but I we stuck with the whole thing because we're competative and wanted to see who'd win."
4,"Pasolini, the author.","As a ""devout"" fan of Pasolini, the atheist (though he loved Christianity), openly gay, and Communist(though he was scorned by the party) in 60-70's Italy was constantly surrounded by controversy. In 'The Ragazzi', the filmmaker-poet novelizes his experiences in the slums of Rome. The story follows a group of young teens as they cause mischief and exercise malicious entertainment on innocent bystanders. In the finale, Pasolini illustrates a destructive perpetual mindset running through Italy at the time; a theme that would continue through the rest of his work.My more in-depth of the novel is at Living with Literature:[...]-Daniel"
5,Truly encyclopedic - with great recipes included,"This is a truly encyclopedic work, essential for anyone interested in serious Asian cooking or eating. Not only is it full of good information on the foodstuffs of the region, it's chockablock with excellent recipes."
4,Very Helpful and Informative Book for New Romance Writers!,"For many years (okay decades), I had a story in my head that I wanted to write. Since the Internet came along, it's become so easy to write and publish your own book! This book helped me get started. I thought that I would get very little 'new' information out of it, but my husband encouraged me to get it, and boy was I ever wrong! This book gave me some tips on things I had not considered and even some new info that I never knew about. All I can say is that if you are a BRAND NEW romance writer, this IS the book for you! The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is that I found it a bit...wordy. haha I think some of the info could have been condensed into a smaller, ""just-the-facts"" book. But still a wonderful reference book that I will keep on the shelf for many years to come."
4,A great place to start,"This is the perfect book for a beginning romance writer that may need an overview of the romance novel market. I found it a quick and easy read filled was lots of good advice and some entertaining stories as well. This will never be the last word on the subject, but certainly worth reading and keeping on the shelf."
5,Breaking into the biggest genre in all of fiction.,"Why would you want to write a romance novel? Might it have something to do with the fact that Romance is far and away the best selling genre in all of fiction.OK, so maybe you'll give it a try. Sooner or later you'll want to sell your work, and who better to sell it to than Leslie Wainger, the Executive Editor of Harlequin Books, quite likely the biggest romance publisher.After twenty five years of being in the romance publishing business, she knows what the readers want. And what the readers want is what the publishers want to publish, and ... well need I go on.The book is about what you would expect, more or less detailed instructions of how to write a book. It covers everything from getting started writing to what kind of paper to use to sending to a publisher. Basically it's all the rules."
1,This Book is terrible and not worth getting.,"I first thought this book would be like the old movie Style Wars. The one with the break dancing in it. But this book is wack and not even worth looking at. So save your money and bounce away from here. Check ya hommies, Loca Kyla"
1,Unreadable junk,"I was his biggest fan. But what happened to the author of Citizens, Landscape and Memory, An Embarrassment of Riches? Apparently he has turned into a lazy, arrogant, and smug hack. This book is horrendous. It is Great Men of History of the crassest order - it's not just that his absurd attempts to rehabilitate Cromwell based on a discredited historian fall flat, it's that he has no time for anyone outside the ruling classes. Worst of all, Schama seems content to have let other people do his research and then take potshots and speculate from the sidelines of his own book. This is trash and a disgrace to a formerly brilliant historian and author."
3,it was OK...,"I loved REVOLUTIONARY ROAD and and THE EASTER PARADE. This book was only OK. Richard Yates is an amazing author, but I found myself bored throughout most of this book."
1,Not what it used to be...,"I've had these round thermostats in my homes for many years, and always thought they were great--simple & reliable. The fancier electronic set-back ones always seemed too fussy (I don't know about you, but i DON'T wake up at the same time every day). But now I've had to replace this Hunnewell unit three times in the past three years. It always breaks, and it's happening again right now, keeping very erratic temps that are sometimes 6 degrees below or above the temp I've set. I can never find my receipt to claim the warranty, and end up paying for an electrician to install it, over and over. This time I'm finally going to buy something different, so I can hopefully have a reliable thermostat that lasts."
1,"No Support, SQL Server base too complicated for most users","This SQL Server based software is too complicated to run on most PC's. The SQL Server kept failing to startup and connect, yet it is too complicated for the inexperienced user to fix. Google ""SQL Server Startup problems"". Yet THERE IS NO SUPPORT from Domin-8, ZERO! Phone calls all answered by a machine, no returned calls, no response via email, NOTHING! I lost all of my business data, two years of tranactions, because even though it was regulary backed up, the software would not run anymore so I could not retrieve it. I eventualy had to purchase another software package and reconstruct everything. Never, Never, purchase software that utilizes a SQL Server if you do not have reliable IT support."
5,"Ess, ess, mein kindt!","News flash! Not everybody's chicken soup is the way your bubbe used to make! This is a great cookbook, filled with recipes from all over America, of Sephardic and Ashkenazic origin, influenced by where people settled. Gefilte fish is made with whitefish, salmon, haddock or shad, depending on what fish swims in the ocean, lake or river near by. There are latkes with zucchini and chili in Arizona and curried sweet potatoes in Flatbush.Along with the recipes, you get history, culture and religion. What could be bad? Certainly not the Chocolate-filled Rugelach! Gosh, I'm getting hungry just typing this."
4,A Taste for Mind and Tongue,"The receipes are functional, even if you are not a gourmet chef. But the stories behind them are just fun to read! A taste--for the mind and tongue--of what life was like for some of our ancestors. I recommend the story of the orange, and the recipe for cranberry applesauce!"
4,"really bad index, good book","I enjoy reading and cooking from this book, but the index on the back is so bad. I got so frustrated just trying to find things from reading the index. When I looked up challah, there's is several pages for it, but non of them is the challah recipe. Those pages was for something else not related to challah. The only way that worked for me was to look through the book, page for page to look for recipes to cook. Another con about the book is there is no pictures of the food, just people and places."
3,A Solid Effort!,"Dr. Deborah Bright describes an eight-step program for gaining more control over your life, both every day and in the long term. She discusses becoming more aware of your level of control, and assuming more responsibility for your own direction. She advocates being a ""pro-achiever,"" with a positive ""take control"" attitude. Although the book's strength resides in stories drawn from personal interviews, the basic principles are very familiar in success and self-help literature. Dr. Bright coins some new phrases, but her advice is not new. However, the self-help audience always seems to welcome a new look at these ideas, restated and repackaged in different ways. We [...] recommend this book to those who want an extra boost in exerting control over their lives, to readers who like strong personal anecdotes, and to beleaguered junior execs who have not yet consulted a basic life management text."
1,Not heavy duty at all,"Poor quality product. Could not cut anything with it, including my childs bike lock which it was purchased for. This ""heavy duty bolt cutter"" would be better described as a wire snipper."
3,Showcase of ballet and today's ABT stars,"I bought this book because I am a big fan of American Ballet Theater and ballet in general. As the title implies, it does indeed give the reader an inside look and overview of ballet history and technique. More importantly, the photos capture the beauty of ballet and showcases the current generation of ABT's stars. For a book that is supposed to represent the ballet world however, it is disappointing to see errors in ballet terminology and not much insight or depth about ballet. As a showcase of today's stars and upcoming ones, I also wish there were captions naming the dancers on each page more clearly and consistently. Personal interviews with corps de ballet dancers would have been interesting, too. Though this shouldn't serve as a reference or informational book, I think many devoted fans will enjoy seeing the beautiful photos."
4,Low cost alternative.,"Not awful for the price. The tool has a little play in the connection of the tips. This could be a problem if the snap ring you're trying to access is in a tight spot. Also, the tips that are included appear to be two sets of the same tips. I could find no difference in the two straight tips or the two bent tips.Summary: If you rarely have to deal with snap rings, these will fill the bill. If you need to work with them regularly, I'd suggest you buy a better quality tool."
2,It almost does the job,"Cheap set on ring pliers, heads are not very sturdy so tend to bend with torque. Ok ifyou use it once in a while, but if you need a.ring plier more then once a week get something better."
2,Cheap and frustrating to use.,"I needed a pair of these pliers to remove a single snap ring on a Razor Pro scooter. When I opened the box for the first time, the retaining bolt popped up and almost hit me in the face!These pliers are cheaply made. The tips don't align properly - I had to use another set of pliers to bend some of the tips to align better. When I used them to open the snap ring, the tips wouldn't stay in the lug holes. I was finally able to get the snap ring off on the 5th attempt by opening the ring just a little and using a flathead screwdrive to pop the ring off.Overall, I would say don't buy these if you need to use them with any frequency, because they aren't worth the frustration. But for one-time use, there isn't anything less expensive."
3,Nice Tool,"This set is a bit smaller than I hade in mind, But still a nice tool! The one down side is, the action is a little loose with the removable style heads."
4,Nice Set for the Money,"For the non-professional mechanic, snap ring pliers are a tool that you need every so often, but would be really nice to have when you need them. These fit that need. The construction is average, but the price is low enough to allow you to purchase it to have it when you need it. If you are a pro using them every day, these wouldn't last long due to the lower quality. For the weekend mechanic - a fine addition to your toolbox."
1,I was extremely disappointed in this product,"This is a product that sounds good via it's description and would probably work in theory. However, the design and manufacturing of the product leave much to be desired. The mechanism for securing the various heads is not well designed. The physical parts for securing the heads are poor quality materials. In short, the heads do not remain firmly secured to the pliers. You will spend valuable time trying to correct the design and manufacturing flaws and ultimatley realize that there is no way to correct them. I was not using this in a ""heavy duty"" aplication and it still failed. I can not recommend this product."
5,solid for the money,Great item for the money. Should hold up under general purpose use. I would recommend this item to others. Easy to switch back and forth
2,These really are terrible.,"I should have known better. These snap ring pliers are terrible quality -- they bend and twist very easily, meaning your snap ring will just pop off, or pop loose suddenly. They are not strong enough to remove the internal snap ring on my standard 3/4"" Craftsman wrench. It would be totally useless for most automotive use.On the other hand, they cost basically nothing. You get basically nothing, so I guess it's an even trade."
4,Good for small jobs,"Nice tool but only good for smaller less ""heavy duty"" type snap rings. If you have a larger gauge snap ring, buy an industrial type. This one is inexpensive enough, but I would recommend a better quality one like the craftsman professional that I ended up having to buy."
4,barely 4 stars,"For the price it's a decent deal. This will work for you if you use it very occasionally, but if you use it often, get something else. The quality is bleh. The plastic case came cracked on delivery. I used this for a HUGE snap ring of which this wasn't really meant to be up to the task. For basic use i'm sure this will be fine."
5,GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!,"I have read all five of Mariam's Journals and enjoyed them all. I felt like I was part of her family.Carrie Bender done an excellent job. I like to hear about the Omnish People. Their beleif is similar to mine.Great job, Carrie Bender"
5,Excellent,"This is one of the best recordings of the Lalo Symphonie Espagnole or Saint-Saens Violin Concerto you'll find anywhere, plus, at a great value!"
4,It works,"The flash cable has up to a 3 foot extension, allowing off camera flash. This helps eliminate red eye for portrait photography. The cable also permits control of shadows. All flash functions such as TTL are retained. The cable was ordered and delivered promptly by Adorama. The price was about one-half that for the Sony brand cable."
4,Second time's a charm,"This is a well-made, hardy product that comes in one piece and is easy to attach to a propane tank. It's easy to light and it has 3 heater settings -- and it throws out a lot of heat. So, just about perfect, except that the heater generated a harmonic (but nevertheless disturbing) ""whine"" after a few minutes; and it wouldn't go away. I contacted the Mr. Heater company and they asked me to use it a little more, to see if the whine went away. It didn't. So I let them know that and they sent me a free replacement. The second unit works perfectly -- I'd give this 5-stars, but the hiccup with the first unit forces me to deduct one star. But the company was responsive and there was no hesitation in sending a free unit when I ran into trouble. So, I recommend it."
4,"Nice heater, keeps you warm","I bought this heater to warm my garage during winter. It gets down to 25 degrees, and it takes the heater about an hour to heat up the garage. I turn on both burners with the valve set to the 2nd setting. Then the garage is a toasty 60 degrees. When the heater is first fired up, the metal groans until the all of the metal is the same temperature. Overall, I think this a god product for heating up a garage. Since the heat is directed up, I wouldn't recommend it for use in a house, too much chance of fire. There is no safe guards should the heater is tipped over or too close to any flammable material, even wood."
3,ok,doesn't give out as much heat as I hoped but will work in a pinch. Wanted it so we could work in the garage in the winter. Doesn't work well enough for that but better than nothing.
5,Good heat!,"I have a double garage below my house. It is cold and damp, and thus unusable. I bought the Mr Heater to make the space functional, and it does a good job of heating and somewhat drying out the space,"
5,Only Frankie Laine Sings these Songs His Way,"Frankie Laine made ""High Noon"" a legendary Western song with his unique voice full of bravado. ""Rawhide"" is yet another example of the staying power I think due in part to his interpretation and drive he delivered. ""Gunfight At O.K. Corral"" is just as impressive. This is a great collection. ""Cool Water,"" ""Muletrain,"" ""The Green Leaves Of Summer,"" ""North To Alaska"" and ""Ghost Riders In The Sky"" are just outstanding."
3,"Good tunes, but not the original album","Unhappily this is not the original album. Some songs are remixed. High Noon was not as I remember it. Some songs are new.I was a little disappointed, but I am enjoying most of the CD. It would have been a better value if it was the original album."
4,Memories of Westerns,"This brings back memories of the westerns I saw as a child. High Noon, Rawhide etc...Frankie Laine has such a memorable voice that these songs by others just don't sound right. I grew up listening to ""Hell Bent for Leather"" and other records like, Marty Robbins and Johnny Horton.(I did purchase two so I could give one as a gift.)I really like the songs on this CD."
4,On the Trail,I grew through my early years listing to Frankie Lane songs and as I remembered his voice was very haunting and clear. So when I ordered this selection I was not disappointed.
2,Not up to scratch,"While well produced, I was disappointed in the album - mostly because the majority of the tracks were re-recordings. Frankie Laine still sounds great - but it just wasn't the same.I bought the CD to replace a well worn vinyl album, but on listening to the CD I found the songs to all be slightly (and in a couple of cases very), different in tempo and vocal inflection - it's definitely not the album I've loved for over 30 years! High Noon in particular is quite different, much slower, with vocal emphasis changed. I'll probably listen to the CD from time to time, but not with the same relish that I enjoyed my old LP."
2,Frankie Laine...On the Trail,"I love Frankie Laine, but this is not one of his best. Too many are songs that were done by someone else and just aren't what I had in mind. Frankie did such a great job on all the hits he had, so I would recommend a greatest hits, etc. CD, instead. This just isn't one of his best."
4,Some of the best true western music!,"This is real western, not the semipop country stuff they put out now. Love, murder, revenge, honor, its all here.Great stuff."
3,Not what I expected,"So after looking at all the good reviews I decided to spend $60 on 2 silk pillowcases.. At first I thought they were great but the material is really thin and its not what I expected at all..After washing them for the first time it also lost softness. I don't think they are worth the price, maybe $30 but definetely not $60."
4,silky but sturdy,"I like these. I wash them in my machine's heavy duty/hot water cycle (I know I'm not supposed to, but I like my bed linens to be super sanitized!) and dry them on high -- and they are still in great condition."
5,First Class Silk,"I really like these pillow cases, nice and thick, smooth as silk...good color...nice sewing...good detail....Vendor also was very good, quick shipment. A good experience all round...will probably order another pair...and my lover liked them too..."
2,misleading info,"There are 2 pillowcases per package which would have been good to know. Perhaps I missed it somewhere. Also, some of the packages are marked ""king"" but this is a mislabeling and the company is aware of it. Although they say ""fits standard/queen"", they are really somewhere in between the queen and king sizes. Some people may think this is a good thing.The white pearl is, to me, a slightly off-white next to my ""white"" sheets but matches my cream duvet cover.The company was very zealous in contacting me and asked for feedback as to how they could improve the information given."
3,Quality may vary...,"I got this as a gift on Christmas. It comes mostly assembled, with only the crossbar in front requiring 3 screws to be inserted and tightened. Well, the holes drilled in the cross-member did not match the tapped holes in the sled. Not even close. I had to re-drill a hole for one of the three screws for things to fit together. Pretty disappointing.The sled itself? I'd say it looks great and works as one would imagine. It does have a nice look to it."
3,Fit and finish lacking...,"I was fortunate enough to get this for a wicked low price last winter and I saved it for ""Santa"" to give to my daughter for Christmas.First, the good: 1) the classic styling looks great; 2) the sled runs pretty well on packed powder, and even better on well-packed crust; and 3) the sled feels solid.Alas, the bad: 1) the steering rail (the only piece which requires assembly) is secured to the frame by three screws, but the pre-drilled were not properly aligned, requiring re-drilling; 2) the rope in the rail is a festive red, but it is comprised of cotton braid which started fraying immediately; and 3) the sled's weight makes it a chore for younger kids to haul back up the hill after each run.In sum, it looks great and runs well for older kids, but given the issues with the assembly I have concerns about the long term durability of the sled."
2,"Oh, give me a break!","Bluegrass??? Collin Raye and Ronnie Milsap? Stonewall Jackson and Charlie Louvin? Sonya Isaacs? Robbie Fulks?? Uh, I don't think so. Well, aside from the cheesy opportunism of Disney trying to latch onto the ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" bandwagon, I guess this is an okay album. A lot of the more modern, crappy soundtrack themes (""You'll Be In My Heart,"" ""Circle Of Life,"" etc.) are included, and an near-equal amount of oldies (""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,"" ""Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah,"" et al) and while there are a couple of instrumentals (giving slight plausibility to the ""bluegrass"" claim), for the most part this is a fairly twangless album. I was happy to see the squeeky-voiced hillbilly filly Elizabeth Cook on here, even though her track doesn&#65533;t highlight her strengths that well. Mostly this is pretty iffy. One thing this most definitely is not: a bluegrass record. For that, try some old Stanley Brothers, or something new by Del McCoury or James King."
2,Didn't do anything for me!,"I am a fan of Disney music, not such a big fan of country or bluegrass though. This CD didn't really do anything for me, listened to it a couple times. I really prefer the original versions of the Disney songs."
4,O Mickey Where Art Thou,This music gives me a lot of happiness. It brings back days when I watched the Mickey Mouse Club and watched the Disney Movies when I was a kid. The joyfulness of the words and music take me away from everyday tasks and worries.I really like this CD.This was a gift for a friend. She heard my CD and said she really liked the music and wanted to share it with her Grandkids.
3,i liked it,"i bought this because it has robbie fulks on it(""when i see an elephant fly""). no dissapointment there. the rest is pretty good, a flat spot here and there. dug the instrumentals, and it was a treat to hear charlie louvin and ronnie milsap."
2,interesting but not worth keeping,"I actually bought the cassette of this recording. When the first time I listened to it, I was so surprised that Karajan was working with someone who had a ""non flawless"" kill. After I figured it out that she was only 12, I was amazed. But there are tons of better recordings out there, why should we keep this one?"
4,Starship Mine - 'Die hard' Star Trek style,"Picard must save the ship from thieves and he is the only one on the ship because they are performing maintenance on the ship at a starbase. A lot of non-stop action, one of Picard's best next to Chain of Command and Best of Both Worlds."
2,disappointing,The paper shredder was received with a dent on the front. I used it and it quickly got too hot from use. It just wasn't the product I needed.
2,Wasted my money,I bought this product (not from amazon) and it lasted all of 2 months. I only used it three times in that period. Wish I could get my money back.
4,Very Good,This I bought for my wife as part of her Xmas candy because she loves this stuff. It came in a timely manner and I didn't notice any rips in the bags or parts unsealed.
4,candy,this candy reminds me of home i like it alot but some of them were melted make sure to order it during cold weather and happy holidays!
1,No Mango Flavor at all!,"I've had a chili covered mango flavored lollipop before and absolutely loved it. The mango flavor was also artificial but was very very mango-like and tasted perfect with the chili spice. This one, however, was a complete disappointment. The chili was oddly sour and the mango-flavored hard candy inside is completely red food colored sugar block. (The one I had before had a shade of green-yellow-orange-red.) I disposed the whole bag after trying the first one."
1,"Good golly, one of the most disgusting items I've put in my mouth!","These suckers have got to be one of the most gosh-aweful pieces of ""candy"" I've eaten. I like spicy things, yet this candy felt like I sucking a salt-lick dipped in chili powder. Granted I don't like salt-rimmed margaritas either, so those who do, might like this candy. Honestly I couldn't get down to the mango bit in the center, I threw it away after the first taste."
4,Really good!,never try this and one day some one give me one and it was really good flavor. I am addicted to them..
1,Yuck,"I should have listened to the other reviews, but a friend had mentioned trying -- and loving -- a product like this (I can only guess it was another brand) and it sounded *so* good. If I had been able to to tolerate the saltiness long enough, perhaps there would have been spiciness. I can't overstate just how salty and gross these were. Perhaps the mango beneath was tasty -- I cannot attest to that. I believe another reviewer mentioned ""taming"" these down by wiping off some of the coating. I can't imagine how one would approach that task, as it really is very well-adhered. If anyone can suggest a better brand, I'd love to know of it -- this combo sounds like it could be wonderful if handled right."
5,"A captivating, human, informed book","As a freelance author writing a piece about salmon for a California-based magazine, this book was indispensible and eye-opening. It is unfailingly sensitive and intelligent about salmon, discussing the fish as fellow creatures in the ""natural economy"" in which we all live, rather than as mere commodities in the ""industrial economy"" that has transformed the West in the last 150 years. It is fascinating about the geology that shaped the salmon's environment, the evolutionary history of the fish, the relationship between Native Americans and salmon in the Northwest, and it provides a detailed history of the many factors that have led to the salmon's decline, including habitat destruction, misbegotten hatchery programs, overfishing, dams, mining, grazing, irrigation. If you like to read books about ecology, the creatures of the earth, fish, or the Northwest--you can't go wrong. This is a wonderful book."
5,important beginning point,"If you want to start to understand the current controversy, read this book first. His commodification theme is quite important. We view salmon and rivers as commodities to be used by humans. We believe that technology will fix all problems. The author concludes by suggesting that we need a new story in regard to our relation with the environment. It only through the construction of a new grand narrative in relation to human's relationship with the environment can we hope to bypass the dams. Given the current political climate and worldviews, let's not hold our collective breathes."
2,Only worked for 2 pairs of shoes,"Pros: It does stretch your shoes.Cons: It stopped working after the 4th shoe. The screw to the main block will no longer turn so it won't open up anymore to stretch in width.It still cost less than having two pairs professionally stretched.If you only want to stretch in width, you probably don't want a 2 way stretcher. One of the pairs I stretched no longer holds onto the back of my heel. I only put the heel piece in to force the front as far into the shoe as possible, but I stretched the back too.Additionally if you're a woman with wide feet and you wear a size 7.5 or above, you might want to go with the men's small stretcher. It's wider than the womens and it fit fine into my size 8 womens shoes."
2,FootFitter Pro Two-Way shretcher,"Product did fine on the first two shoe stretchings, then the entire thing fell apart. I bought it because it was stated that the shank was metal (thus more durable) and would last longer than the others that were plastic.Not a high quality product, another Made-in-China wonder, not!!"
2,Stopped working,"Needing a shoe stretcher, I ordered this. While I thought it good at first, within a matter of a few weeks, it broke so that I can no longer widen it (to stretch it out width wise). If you get it through Amazon, you can not return it for an exchange but only a refund (if the fault of the return is not Amazons). Had I ordered it directly from the original sender, I would have been sent a replacement. Caveat."
1,Broke before even using it!,"I opened the package and tried to expand the shoe stretcher and it opened, so I put it in a shoe and tried it again...now, it wouldn't open - just kept spinning until it hit the end...then worked it back the other way - still didn't do anything. Thought I would try the length, and that worked. I don't know if I got a lemon, but after reading other reviews, I think this product is pretty cheap. I'm going to purchase another set of better quality and try this again.Oh, and it says it comes with excellent instructions...mine did not. Just came in a clear plastic bag. Not the most enticing packaging."
2,VERY LIMITED MOTION -essentially worthless,major disappointment!! The action of the screw that spreads the toes to create stretch is so limited that it will only stretch a shoe 1/4 inch -and that's if it fit the shoe tight like a glove. Then the action is only at the tip of the toe -none at the width or ball of foot.
2,Poor Quality,The good. Worked on a pair of running shoes I boughtThe bad: already loosing its ability to stretch the width and the main arm is already starting to bend.Very poor quality.
5,Shoe stretcher,"Outstanding product, easy to use, flexible options with little add on bumps and lumps to simulate your specific foot. I got two so that I could do both shoes in a pair at the same time and keep them set up for future use without having to make additional adjustments. Several pairs of shoes, both high heeled and flat, which were new and somehow fit much less well than they had in the store, became comfortable after stretching for about 24 hours."
4,Worked pretty well.,"I bought this shoe stretcher because I recently bought a pair of cycling shoes that were ""just a tad"" too small. These shoes are made of almost entirely synthetic material as well, which wasn't supposed to stretch very well.I put the shoe stretcher in each shoe for 48 hours, leaving them outside so the material could go through temperature changes.In the end the shoes broke in very well using the stretcher. I have lots of toe room and they are now the ""right size"""
2,Comes with excellent instructions??????,"Where are the instructions? I just received the Pro Two Way Shoe Stretcher. It came on time and lookedjust like it appeared on the web site. The description on the web site (see below) says it comes with excellent instructions. There were no instructions included. I am requesting the instructions! Please!I am giving it a poor review, but will follow up with another review if I receive the advertised instructions.Pro Two-Way Shoe StretcherWoodBeech wood construction, Steel-threaded rod for width stretchingComes with excellent instructions, Stretches length and widthFits for right and left shoe, Three complimentary corn piecesPain relief for bunions, hammertoes, etc., Available in different widths for men or women7 different sizes, Not sold in pairs"
1,Poor Product,This product is awful. It broke on the second use. I went out of my way not to over tighten anything. There is a long partiality threaded rod (piece with the hook on it) that ends in a plastic spreader. As you tighten down rod the friction applied to the spreader causes it break lose internally and push the rod all the way through the spreader. Causing a failure. (very poor design). Something like a BB on the end of the rod would have worked. The BB would have kept the drill through effect of the rod from happening (The end of the rod is so ragged I cut my finger just trying to get the spreader back on)
2,Does not work on wide shoes,"The product looks OK, however I can't rate it highly as I was expecting to stretch my 4E width shoes with it. It simply is not large enough to stretch wide shoes. It may work OK with narrower shoes, but I wouldn't know."
1,Arrived already broken; got worse,"This item arrived with some plastic already broken off. The stretcher was still usable, and I needed to stretch a pair of shoes right away, so I decided to keep it. The stretcher worked fine; I was able to to make my shoes more comfortable one at a time. However, after stretching only 3 pairs of shoes, the screw inside got stripped and now the stretcher is stuck in the closed position! I am purchasing a more expensive stretcher as I write this review. I have learned my lesson about cheap shoe stretchers."
5,wonderful stretch fitter,This stretch has enough little inserts to stretch the shoe in the most needed areas. It worked well when I left the stretcher in my shoes for several days.
5,TOP QUALITY UNIT,I SENT BACK THE BROVO BRAND SHOE STRETCHERS / I DID GET A REFUND / THE FOOTFITTER PRO TWO-WAY IS A TOP QUALITY PRODUCT.I KNOW THIS / I HAD THE BROVO BRAND / THE FOOTFITTER PRO IS PRICEY $16.95 FOR ONE NOT A PAIR / YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.
2,no instructions,"The product seems pretty good, but there were NO instructions and it took a while to figure out how to use it."
1,Useless After Only 2 Pairs of Shoes...,Have had this stretcher for less than 60 days and after stretching only 2 pairs of shoes it is now completely broken beyond use.Threading is stripped and it will no longer screw open OR closed. It's frozen stuck halfway open.Next time I'll invest in a more expensive stretcher and hope the quality reflects the larger investment.
2,IS THERE A GUIDE,"I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS PRODUCT DOES EVERYTHING AND MORE BUT WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS AND NEVER HAVING THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT TO USE BEFORE, I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT EXCEPT TO SAY SEND INFO ALONG WITH THE PRODUCT THEN MAYBE I WILL WRITE A DECENT REVIEW UNTIL THEN A WASTE OF MONEY"
2,Flimsy,"The product is pretty flimsy. It does the job but sometimes when turning the knobs to stretch/retract, it just spins and spins without actually moving. Quite annoying."
5,Good Stretcher,"I'm very happy with this stretcher. I have a new pair of Reebok walking shoes that hurt my foot where my bunion is located. It worked great. I read the reviews so I was careful with the stretcher & didn't force it too hard, just a little at a time, with the stretcher spray. I have used it on 2 pair of shoes & it is still in fine shape."
3,Shoe stretcher,"The shoe stretcher seemed to have done its job reasonably well. Although directioins said to leave in for 48 hours, the critical shoe required an extra 24 hours, but after that point it was fine. THe directions were clear."
5,It works.,"Since I wear a brace on one foot - I need to stretch one shoe. This gadget works so well, I've gotten a few of them."
1,Not built to last,"I purchased one of these stretchers in December 2011. It has only been used on one pair of shoes. Yesterday, the threaded shaft that stretches the shoe lengthwise mysteriously snapped in two. Unfortunately, this par for the course for shoe stretchers these days. Too many of the load bearing parts are made of plastic that falls apart before you can put enough tension into the leather to actually stretch the shoe. Why doesn't anyone offer a decent stretcher at a reasonable price? My wide feet are desperate for something that works and lasts."
5,Works Great!!!!,"I had a pair of reproduction brogans that had sat in the closet for over fifteen years and had shrunk down. I could hardly get my foot in them, much less wear them. I bought this, soaked the brogans in water, used the stretcher, and viola! They fit better than I remember them fitting when new. This item is well made and ""works a treat"" as my UK friends would say. It is well-constructed, unlike many out there that are cheaper, made of plastic, and break when you use them. I consider this item a wise investment indeed."
4,Works OK,The spreader mechanism is made out of metal but the length adjuster is plastic which would strip if I forced it during lengthing. It actually worked to widen the width but don't expect it to stretch the width by some hughe amount. It just made the shoe feel looser. I spayed water on my shoes while stretching. I used it on cloth shoes and not leather. I think the widing screw is bottoming out on the length adjuster so I may try to cut the length screw shorter so the widing screw will turn more. Make sure your laces are really tight when stretching the width.
4,help for too-shallow shoes,"This shoe stretcher did indeed stretch the top of my shoes upward somewhat so that there was more room for my feet. It's a little hard to wedge in, however; and you need to turn it slowly each day or two. To do any good, I had to reach the highest point possible. Could have used a bit more height but did get some."
4,Saved Blisters,I bought several pairs of deck shoes and I bought this to stretch them a little bit so I won't have to get blisters. It worked well....................
1,One stretcher? Shoes come in pairs just like feet!,"Was hoping to expand my shoe wardrobe by fixing several pairs of shoes that are now just too tight in a few places.I recall reading in some customer review that this was for a pair of stretchers. How can I expect to stretch a pair of shoes with just one stretcher? By the time the second pair is done the first is already back to square one.Though said to include instructions I have none. When I try to get the heel part to stay put it always seems to come lose.I can't tell if it is broken or I am doing something wrong.At $16 something a pop plus shipping it would be better to get a more expensive model that includes two stretchers, instructions and better craftsmanship."
1,Disappointed,I bought Tamar Myers' book because it was recommended to me first by Amazon.com because of my purchase history and then by the reader reviews. I was so disappointed that I didn't even finish the book. The characters I encountered were shallow and not very compelling. I found the writing to be silly and immature and the plot completely unbelievable. A woman finds a priceless painting and hides it in her oven? Give me a break. My advice; save your money for something worth reading.
5,Worth Waiting For!,"After waiting awhile for the newest in the Den of Antiquity series, I was NOT disappointed!Once again, Abby (not AbbEy) gets dropped SMACK in the middle of an explosive situation!Myers is fantastic when it comes to dreaming up so many ways to throw you off the scent!ps: Yoder is here too!Fantastic Book"
2,2 stars,"The best thing about this movie is that it was filmed at the actual places where the events took place. It is a very poorly acted movie. I suggest the documentary ""One Day in September"" which has a lot of actual news footage from the incident."
5,21 Hours at Munich,This is an excellent video.It met all the expectations and I was indeed pleased. I also encourage those history fanatics to seek this video and follow the cause of history as it happened.
1,Subject matter is poorly researched,"Chotkowski should be ashamed of himself. He obviously did little, if any, real research into modern Chiropractic and relied instead on theories that are over 100 years old. If someone wrote a book condemning the medical community because people were dying from ""Brain Fever, Dropsy, or Ague"" no one would pay any attention. You shouldn't pay attention to this one either. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up. It is nothing but sour grapes."
1,Very Poor- Biased Viewpoint On A Beneficial Service,"This book flies in the face of the experience of millions of people throughout the world who have benefitted greatly from chiropractic. This medical doctor has no sense of understanding of its real value. Chiropractic is safe, natural and efffective for many aspects of general health. Certainly its value for musculoskeletal injury (neck & back pain) has been well established by the medical and scientific community which has prompted it's coverage by almost all insurance carriers in the USA. This man's opinion seems extremely biased and uninformed."
1,What an idiot.,"It never ceases to amaze me. Medical care, by their own statistics, is at least the 3rd, and possibly the second or first leading cause of death in this country (""Is US Health Really the Best in the World""; Barbara Starfield, MD, MPH; JAMA, July 26, 2000--Vol 284, No. 4), and calls Chiropractic dangerous and unproven? People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. I wouldn't be a bit surprised to find where the funding for such ""propaganda"" as this comes from. Amazon needs to add a review rating of zero stars, as one is too many for this book."
1,And meds dont kill over 300 people a day?,There is plenty of research out there to back up chiropractic and the benefits people receive from such. All people have to do is get off there lazy buts and read it. over 300 people a day die from adverse drug reactions and we hardly hear about that. One incident occurs in the media about chiropractic and that streamlines. MD's are SCARED of chiropractors because we offer a way to correct problems instead of covering up symptoms that can only make people worse. This author wanted to make a few bucks and just bad mouth chiropractic.
1,How many people are maimed by Chiropractors a year?,"I have a few questions to the author. How many people are maimed by chiropractors a year? and What is your definition of scientific? In my chiropractic office I see people hurt and maimed by what I think you would call your ""scientifically proven procedure"". I invite the doctor to see how many people benefit from the chiropractic care they receive in my office."
1,Chiropractors usually are far superior to M.D.'s!!!,"For problems with the musculoskeletal system, a patient would do FAR better to see a chiropractor vs. an MD. MD's are usually clueless when it comes to back pain, neck pain, etc. (""Take these pain killers and lie down for 2 weeks."")This book is a farce and representative of the close-mindedness of too many MD's regarding the great profession of chiropractic."
1,Nothing could be farther from the truth..,It's unfortunate that in this day and age we have an MD so misinformed and prejudiced about a profession that has offered so many great benefits to suffering people all over the world. The scientific literature (including many medical journals) DOES support spinal adjustments - with many clinical trials already done. Spinal manipulations courses are currently offered in some of the most respected medical schools! Where has this doctor been? What is his motive?
1,A senile moron.,"I think the age is getting better of this 'Dr' (I laugh as I type it - because he seems to know nothing of either profesions he talks about)A totaly misleading, and pointless book.Write all the good reviews about yourself as you want 'Dr' and give as many stars to yourself as you wish.It wont change the fact that your 'book' is an inacurate, boring, peice of trash."
1,Chotkowski just doesn't get it...still,"The bone on nerve theory accounts for less than 10% of all VSC, he should look into the Koor model of facilitaion, and the newer theories presently taught at chiropractic colleges today."
5,A Must Read Book on Chiropratic,"To be an informed comsumer before going to a chiroprator you must read this book. I was told by a chiroprator that my high blood pressure could be treated without medication by chiropratic treatment and that it would take care of any sinus troubleand arthritis in the process.The book explains how all these claims are not true. A very readable, easy to understand book."
1,A sad day for patients everywhere,"I am an MD and a DC (Doctor of Chiropractic). This book was a completely biased account of a profession that has had a profoundly positive impact on patient care and wellness. It is simply another example of certain doctor's realization that they are not the only way to acheive good health. I too was a skeptic of chiropractic. However, rather than allow fear to influence my opinion, I chose to explore the practice. One must ask oneself, ""Should I doubt because an MD told me to? Or should I see for myself?"" I have found countless scientific evidence to support chiropractic. I recommend that Chotkowski and Chotkowski re-evaluate their research. This book is simply an attempt to keep patients brainwashed. Unfortunately, it is a matter of dollars and cents. Be aware of the motivation to discredit a practice that seeks wellness above all else, without toxic side effects."
1,Can a disc put pressure on to a nerve root?,Do we not move as we walk and bend? Does not vertebra move and shift? Does not the disc move with the vertebra? Are there not operations that go into peoples backs with knives to remove discal material to take the pressure of the nerve root?What ignorance dwells in the mind of those who have no logic?
1,WHEN LIFE AND HEALTH MATTERS,"It seems that america is somewhat ignorant. All the previous reviews agreeing with the book say that chiropractic is not based on sceintific studies, but they ignore the other posts that specifically cite studies that prove chiro. Uneducated ingnorant people dont understand chiropractic, they just want the pain to go away. It's funny that top athletes like Troy Aikman, Dan O'Brian, and Emmit Smith, who depend on their body for money, use chiropractic. Chiropractic is a healthy lifestyle. So therefore if you dont care about health, then you will never understand chiropractic. MARK MY WORDS, CHIROPRACTIC WILL SOON BE SEEN AS PRIMARY CARE IN MOST STATES. PEOPLE ARE SEEING THE TRUTH ABOUT CHIROPRACTIC. MEDICINE CAN NO LONGER PULL THE WOOL OVER OUR EYES, BECUASE NOW AMERICANS WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHATS OUT THERE. IF YOU HAD A CHOICE, WHAT WOULD YOU WANT, SURGERY OR AND ADJUSTMENT?"
1,Someone needs to do their homework,Someone needs to do their homeworkMaybe the next book will reflect some actual and factual data!!!
1,Ignorant Medical Propoganda.,"This book is yet another attempt of the medical community to berate and condemn the chiropractic profession. Medicine has been up against the profession of chiropractic for well over a century and biased works of literature(sic) will always be prevelant in a world of free speech and expression. Have the medical profession substantiate the ever alarming unnecessary drug overdose deaths and misdiagnosing deaths that far outnumber any chiropractic mistakes. Terrible book, however I do need lining for my bird cage."
1,Poor Attempt to discredit an valuable profession.,As a life-long patient of chiropractic I am shocked that such a mis-informed view is written by a medical doctor. My experiences with chiropractic care were at an early stage life-changing.. Nothing I read in this book matched the reality of care that me and my family have benefitted from.
1,Puh-lease,"Don't even bother buying this book. I purchased it before going to a chiropractor and was scared stiff. However, after going to the chiropractor I found that much of the information portrayed is just completely wrong and outdated. Did the author even research chiropractic? Was the book ghost-written by a medical doctor because, as someone else pointed out, chiropractors are taking away patients from MD's?Don't let this book scare you. Do what I did: Go to a chiropractor and see for yourself what it is like, then make your own educated choice. It's really the only way."
1,"A one sided approach, basically :IGNORANT.",It's MD's like those who poisin the world.I'm not saying there aren't bad chiropractors but usually wise people learn to Discriminate rather than Generalize.I suggest the author take a serious look in the mirror.
1,"""Chiropractic the greatest hoax of the Century?"" review","As a chiropractic student I have found this book to not only be invalid, but to also be a ""one-eyed"" estentric view of the chiropractic profession. This not only shows the arrogance of the general medical population, but also it's lack of understanding of our profession. We found this book to have little scientific standing, and to express it's false views without proper knowlege and/or research. Perhaps if the authors of this ""gathering of words"" did some real research and proper patient studies, the public could benifit to chiropractic's full potential. I would like to ask the authors that if chiropractic is such a hoax, why do people continue to visit chiropractors with such excellent results, and how has the profession flourished especially over the last decade. Are the authors suggesting that the general public is stupid?"
1,A terribly misguided book,"I read this book--twice--and found it to be terribly misguided as it does not truly understand the theory behind chiropractic. While I do not believe chiropractic can ""fix"" as many problems as they claim, there is ample evidence--even in medical journals--to support its use as a form of treatment. This book is another veiled attempt at an MD shooting down the competition.I recently read that a year or two ago was the first time an MD's average salary declined, while a chiropractor's (as well as other alternative practitioners) salary increased. I'm sure this does not sit well with allopathic medicine, and they are doing what they can to put down the competition, whether it's chiropratic or acupuncture or whatever."
1,WAST OF TIME,DOCTOR Chotkowski YOU WAST SO MUCH TIME TO WRITE THIS BOOK IF YOU LIKED TO HELP PEOPLE YOU SHOILD OF DONATE YOUR TIME FOR USEFULL RESEARCH .I AM A MEDICAL DOCTOR AND I REFER SOME OF MY PATIENTS TO CHIROPRACTOR AND IT IS JUST UNBELIVEBLE HOW MUCH CHIROPRACTIC WORKS .IF YOU ARE M.D AND YOU DON'T LIKE ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE IT IS JUST BEACAUSE YOU LIKE TO MAKE MORE MONEY $$$ .I WOULD RECOMMAND CHIROPRACTIC CARE AND IT IS SAFE .DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK .
1,CHIROPRACTIC IS THE ONLY WAY TO GO,"I HAVE NEVER READ THIS BOOK, BUT WHEN I SAW THE REVIEWS I WAS OUTRAGED. THE AUTHOR MUST BE A NARROW- MINDED- NITWIT.Over the past few years my hair has been very dry and brittle. I went to a chiropractor last December. He did acupuncture on me, and in three weeks I noticed a difference in my hair. I have had three acupuncture treatments since then, and my hair is longer and healthier.MY DAD HAD ACUPUNCTURE DONE, AND IN A FEW MINUTES, HE FELT BETTER."
1,HORRIBLE,these golf balls will bring a major hook to your golf swin save your money and buy some callaway's or top flight's
5,Great bonus disk,"Love love love this bonus disk. Being one of the people back in 1977 who made Star Wars the phenomenon that it became, I was blown away from all of the new information about the first triology. Thanks George for giving this gift to all of us"
5,a great and thorough documentary.,"if you want to watch a long and thorough documentary about every aspect of the creation of star wars, including the writing process and influences and the painstaking development of never before created special effects, the battles with the studios and financiers who thought the whole thing was silly and ridiculous, the puppetmakers and puppeteers, the set builders, the concept paintings that blueprinted the imagery for the whole movie...i highly recommend this disc.there is another documentary i own, but as far as i can see, it's only available on VHS. it's called ""from star wars to jedi"". it has lots of footage that this documentary doesn't. and this disc has lots of stuff that that VHS documentary doesn't."
3,Not the definitive bonus disc,"The Empire of Dreams documentary is worth watching, but otherwise this disc is filled with miscellaneous garbage, like video game trailers. I was very disappointed to see that it didn't have the deleted scenes from the original trilogy. I hope one day Lucas releases those. Overall, this disc alone isn't worth the price."
4,If you know what a Lekku is this is for you.,"Most common fans won't get overly excited about these bonus features, and it really is a shame that there isn't more here or that it wasent included with the new box set release. But for those that love Star Wars you'll easily blow threw a lazy evening or two with this DVD. It has lenghty interveiws and indeph documantry's about why the Star Wars movies were made and alot of the personal experiences that went into them."
3,WATCH OUT!,"This book is good but DO NOT PUT YOUR CHILD TO SLEEP ON ITS STOMACH AS THIS OUTDATED BOOK SUGGESTS ... DOCTORS NOW TELL PARENTS TO PUT THEIR CHILDREN TO SLEEP ON THEIR BACKS, BECAUSE OF S.I.D.S."
1,Color/quality not as advertised,"I have these DKNY sheets and wanted a replacement for the top sheet. The color in the picture represented on Amazon was the exact color of the sheets. However, when I received the package, the color of the sheet was orange and not pink as expected. Also, you could tell it was a second - quality of the fabric was not like the original. Very disappointed with the false advertising since it was very evident that the manufacturer would not have allowed this sheet to pass inspection."
2,Poor version,"This Magic Flute is not quite a good version. Starts good, but some arias are just poor sung... choose another one."
4,Good techniques and updated to CD!,I found the instruments and surveys provided were very useful in creating new training strategies. The techniques worked very well in gathering information to make training more specific and personal to your needs.This toolkit has also been updated to include a CD.
1,This book needs analysis itself.,"There is very little content other than forms, which are included on the diskette (not CD?) but unfortunately the forms are in PDF format. The description states ""A diskette with all of the instruments and surveys is also included so that can be edited to reflect company specific information, goals and objectives"" - unfortunately someone forgot to tell them that PDF's cant be edited.Save your money - this book has questionable value and at [it's price] I expect more - This book is going back."
5,More Than Skin Deep,"This book is very interesting because it tells about the culture, the music, each instrument, the rhythms, their counts, and how to break them down. It gives a resource guide, list of favorite CD's, how to mix your own practice CD, plus lots of history and explaination about each style of bellydance.Bellydancing is more than just a series of movements. It has thousands of years of culture behind it and if you dance without paying attention to that, you lose the meaning.Tamalyn Dallal travels aound the world to teach bellydancing, but she also learns the local dances from the countries she visits. There is tremendous depth in her knowledge, and this book expresses that."
2,Largely a compilation of tourist maps and old NYTimes pieces,"The articles are useful for a view of the early part of the Bosnia war, but the maps are simply taken from pre-war highway touring guide maps of Yugoslavia. They are very general and do not offer a very clear view of the actual Bosnian conflict. This volume is hastily constructed and extremely commercial. A truly careful Atlas, using the widely available census date from the former Yugoslavia, showing the population of each town and section by group, and showing the exact position of the moving inter-ethnic boundaries during the conflict would be invaluable and is still desperately needed. Why the editors did not take advantage of thw extraordinary census information on the public record escapes this reviewer, but it is deeply disappointing. Volumes that do present this vital information are available, but not on the standard U.S. markets."
1,Atlas of War & Peace: Bosnia Herzegovina,"This atlas may be useful for highways. Other readily available atlases and maps duplicate the other cartographic information. The text has to be updated, and the maps are useless for changes after the wars started."
5,A valuable tool for the Balkan travler,"I purchased this work at a military exchange while deployed to Korea with the U.S. Army. Six months later I had the occasion to put the atlas to practical use while traveling around the American sector of Bosnia & Herzegovina as an Army Broadcast Journalist. If you're going, get it."
1,This flick has the perfect title and setting.,"Ever lost money in a casino? Of course you have. How does it make you feel? As you recall those stomach churning moments of ""Lost Wages"", plan to feel the same way if you watch this bomb. One of the worst flicks I've seen in quite a long time."
3,Much smaller than I expected,"Guess I should study the demensions more closely but I had seen similar ones in a larger size and sort of expected that was the norm. So just know, yes it's very cute but it's small. Perfect for a two or three yr olds hands. The sound is so-so. I expected something I little cleaner sounding. You get what you pay for! :)"
2,disapointing,"This turtle is pretty cute, but as far as playing music goes, it doesn't sound very nice. I wouldn't buy another and wouldn't recommend it."
5,I have read and loved this book since I was seven years old!,"This is one of the cutest books I have ever read. It is a great book to pull out on a rainy day, I never get bored with it, no matter how many times I read it. The poems are all funny, and they can cheer anyone up. I will definatly treasure this book forever!"
4,Kiara,"This book has many poems.Its a great way to get you into peoms.Shel Sliverstein has a way to make peoms entertaining in stead of one of shake spear peoms which is of love n everthing else being sad.I wasnt into peoms til i read his peoms which i love and i am collecting all his books.So this book which im reading now ""A light in the attic"" is one of my favorite.The peoms had me laughing so much.I was really into one of the peoms called ""little abigail and the beautiful pony""this peom is on page 121.This peom reminds me of myself as a spoil girl wheni was little and i use to say so many things just for i could get what i want.I read that peom more then once its about a girl who dies just because her parents didnt give her the pony she wanted.But anyways this book also has few drawings that just want to leave you laughing when you see it.This book just wants you to write peoms."
5,Fabulous Author and Books!!!,"I have loved Shel Silverstein's books since I was little. I have read each of the Light in the Attic and Where the Sidewalk Ends cover to cover more times than I can count. Now, I want to start reading them to my children. My son is still an infant, but I'll get so much enjoyment reading them to him anyway. The stories take me to different worlds and let my imagination run wild!"
5,Great book,Great book that I loved as a kid. It even comes with a few extra poems that weren't in the book when I read it as a child.
4,this is a dope book,I use to read this when I was a kid. Now I got it for my daughter. I'm so excited to read it with her. Memories!!!
4,Best Value for the price,"IT was great for the price. I didn't know it was missing the cover, but the price was so low it didn't matter."
5,A Light In The Attic,"Hope,The book A Light In The Attic is very good because I like all of the little poems and most of the poems are really funny!The authorof the book is Shel Silverstein and I think that his style is to be really funny and to make people lauph and well he made me lauph.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to lauph or likes fairytales.Personaly I can't wait to get my hands on another one of Shel Silverstein's books!!!"
1,oh dear,"Too much Shel is NOT a good thing! I felt my IQ level drop as I read this book, I wasn’t amused by his style and I’m sorry I didn’t read up on him more before I purchased several of his books. BE SURE you do your research because how he expresses himself is simply a matter of opinion, you just might not like it!"
1,a light in the attic,It was full of so much nonesense. I thought it was so ridiculous to even bother to read it. The poems were for 4 year olds.
1,I READ NOW YRS AGO AS CHILD,"AND I DONT MARK OUT ANYTHING OF REMEMBERANCE VALUE THAT I CAN ACCORD TO THIS BOOK. MAYBE GOOD FOR KID, BUT NOW WHEN YOUNG ADULT I SEE THIS BOOK IN OLD BOX BUT CONTENTS FAIL TO REMEMBER..."
5,I love it,My book finally came and I love it so much! Page by page reminds me of my childhood and how it was read in my classroom. As a child the book seemed so much bigger and my hands could hardly wrap around it. I have enjoyed also the 12 new poems within the special edition section of the book. This lovely book brings back so many treasured memories that I will continue to treasure for years to come.
5,in the family,This is for iur 35 year old son and his son...... we won't give our copies up. Grandpa and Grandma.
5,Fans of Silverstein,My daughter is a huge fan of Shel Silverstein. I have bought all of the books for her and she loves them. Clever poems that are fun to read.
4,Funny poems to make you laugh!,"This is a book of funny poems kids might like. The poems are about silly things like a babysitter sitting on babies! Some also tell stories. Some poems are so funny like Prayer of the Selfish Kid, Spelling Bee, Something Missing, and How Not to Dry the Dishes. I like this book because I love poems that make me laugh. If you like poems you will love this book."
5,A great book I would recomend to anybody.,"A Light in the Attic is a great book of poems for kids. There are some GREAT poems, some pretty good poems, and some that made you think why you bought the book. Then you remember that most of the poems are great, just like Shel Silverstein. He has two great books , this and Where the Sidewalk Ends. It is a great book for kids and so are all the rest of them that he writes. I would recomend this book to anyone, even adults"
5,My 9 year old daughter loved it,"She started reading Silverstein in school and asked for the whole collection. I would definitely recommend to get your kids reading. The poems are funny, short and interesting."
4,"Wondeful, funny, and educational in its own way.","I bought this for my granddaughter's 8th birthday and she loves it. After looking through it myself, it had me laughing. Silverstein never dissapoints."
5,FUN READING,Fun with poetry. Change up your voice and get silly and your kids will remember this time shared for many years to come. Mine did and he is now 27.
5,Great book,My 6 year old son enjoys these silly poems. My 10 year old daughter also likes them. She always grabs the book to read in the car.
5,You Will Never Get Bored!,"I love this book as I read and read it as a child. It is a great family fun book as you can read each one until every person in your family has them all memorized and still never get bored. My eight-year-old daughter has now recently found a love for poems, and reads a selection each night. She has really enjoyed this book and I watch the expression on her face and the enjoyment through her eyes. Nobody should grow up without this book!"
4,My second intro to Silverstein,"This was the second book I ever read, back when I was in the fourth grade, of Shel Silverstein's.Where the Sidewalk Ends 30th Anniversary Edition: Poems and Drawingswas the first one of his that I read, and I enjoyed A Light in the Attic, but not quite as much as Where the Sidewalk Ends. Both are good books and are excellent additions to any bookshelf, whether for adults or children. I can't believe as a child I missed some of what I can only say is innuendo. I still laugh, today, to read this book. The poems are quirky, and some are just downright silly, but if you don't take yourself or life too seriously, they are really funny--because they are true!This isn't a boring, stuffy poetry book though. This is storytelling of the human condition in a humorous form that often rhymes, sometimes poorly...LOL"
3,This book isn't worth what I paid for.,"A Light in the Attic didn't appeal to me as much as Where the Sidewalk Ends. Sure, there were some cute poems, such as ""God's Wheel"" and ""Zebra Question."" But most of the other poems looked like ol' Shel was trying too hard. My advice to you Shel fans: borrow this book from a friend or check it out at your local library if you want to buy it. To me, it wasn't worth what I paid for."
5,Great Poems!,"Light in the Attic is a collection of poems that are as much fun as a barrel of monkeys. Shel Silverstein writes poems that are silly, wacky and make you laugh right out loud. If you are having a bad day, read some of the poems in this book and your day will get better right away. I would recommend this book to any people from 2 years old to 100 years old."
1,Disappointing at best,"The book was a major disappointment. I am glad that I did not purchase it for my class, but instead borrowed it. The ordering of topics and emphasis choices never seemed to make sense to me. The layout throughout most of the text is like one long, run-on sentence. The underlying structure of numerical analysis never developed and I was left swimming in meaningless details while the basics were short-changed by an over abundance of specialized algorithms. Perhaps the text's curriculum could be saved by a capable professor, but alas my professor was just as scatter-brained as the text. More pictures would also have been helpful. A replacement text I recommend, which covers the first, matrix theory portion of this book, is David S. Watkins' Fundamentals of Matrix Computations."
5,My FAVORITE MAGAZINE EVER!!!!,"Okay, Muse is Just awesome. it gives regular teens/preteens like me excellent reading material as sophisticated as the stuff in national geographic,but presented in a fun way. midwest educator, I my opinion you are totally wrong.we dont want ""adult-level"" stuff all the time. Let kids be kids! Muse is ANYTHING but a waste of time or money.I, like many,many others simply ADORE this magazine and I'm not going to grow out of it anytime soon. This magazine has received at least one letter from a parent who loves it!It's not one of those magazines geared toward small children,like so many kids science magazines you will find,Its great for our age level. Even though the age reccomendation is 10+,i read and loved it at age 9. Muse is an excellent,wonderful,awesome,great,flamablamablous,(umm... where's my thesaurus?)magazine for kids and kids at heart."
2,Where's the magazine?,"I can't review this because, unlike the other magazine that I ordered at the same time, this one hasn't arrived. I'll revise my comments if I ever see the product."
3,Seems interesting to my 11 yr. old,I purchased this for my 11 year old son. the first issue came this week. He said he only had time to skim it but the articles seemed interesting to him and he is looking forward to reading them. I also skimmed throught the first issue and it did seem to be different than anything else I have seen.
4,Brain food for kids,When my 10 year old Grandson received his first issue he sat down and went through it non stop. He is still quoting it.
5,Nothing better,"I've been suscribing to Muse for over 2 years, and I have never been able to put it down, even when the article is on something I am not interested in. If you love absorbing information and funny comics (Kokopelli is the best!), then Muse is for you!"
5,The Magazine that has it all,"Muse runs articles on art, history, science, math and occasionally literature. It's like one of those ""full year of curriculum"" CD Roms only much more educational, less repetitious and way more fun. I've been a subscriber since 1998 and I haven't grown out of it yet.Muse is an infinite source of odd factoids to impress your friends with, as well as explanations for phenomenons you've always wondered about, or used to take for granted. The range of articles is sure to broaden your interests.On the fun side, the comic strip cast of ""muses"" keep things light and appealing to all ages. I highly recommend Muse, especially to home scholars, as a truly entertaining and educational magazine in a world where both terms are used to lightly.I give Muse two thumbs up, five stars, and my undying loyalty."
4,Not just once,My son enjoys reading and can't wait to get his copy of magazine. Plenty for adults to check out as well. Very interactive also. Draw back is that it is a little pricey but worth it.
2,"Interesting true-life book, although title is misleading.","From the title, you wouldn't guess that this book was written in defense of the author's religion and in a way against the Mormon religion. It is her life in the 60s at BYU. She isn't Mormon when she arrives and she isn't Mormon when she leaves. I give her credit for not being swayed by other people's social pressures, but why go to a school that's not your religion and then write a book complaining about it years later?"
1,A Softened Attack on Mormons,"This book may seem informative to many people, but it is in no way an accurate portrayl of Mormons. The author tries to craftily make it look like she is praising the people, while subtlely belittling them. It should be understood that there is much diversity among Mormons as with any large religious group. There were some problems with the author's understanding of Mormon doctrine as well. If you want to learn about the Mormons, learn about them from their scriptures. That will teach you more than these sorts of books."
4,Decent book,"It is a decent book. Not light reading though. I did like the discussion about the various vaccines and when to definitely stay away from certain ones. This is not something I have found in other books on childhood allergies. If I have a criticism of the book, it is only that they did not address vaccines as being a cause of food allergies."
2,Not fully compatible with every furnace..,"I have an older furnace that seems to have issues with this thermostat (and not with any other I've tried.) When the set temperature is well below the air temperature (ie, furnace should remain off), it rapidly cycles the furnace in a strange way (just the compressor -- the burners don't light, and it's a continuous three-second cycle.) After discussing it with support, they claimed my furnace was at fault. Odd, considering that the old non-programmable thermostat was fine, as well as the replacement programmable thermostat (different brand.)I don't think it's a common issue, but Honeywell's claim that it could not be their product at fault annoyed me."
3,Decent,"One problem with the product and it's not the product itself. The instruction booklet and the instructions on the unit itself are SO SMALL that you can barely read them, especially if you require aids for reading. I would recommend that you either 1) make the print larger in the little manual or 2) enlarge the print on the unit. Trying to make adjustments is very challenging and downloading a manual is not a stroll in the park either."
1,Not What I Ordered,"I odered a Honeywell CT3200A which was indicated as ""IN Stock"". They sent me a less expensive substitute.I should have been contacted and asked if I wanted the less expensive substitute. Also if they were going to substitute the price should have been adjusted.Now I have to incure additional cost to return it ! I am very disatisfied. First bad experience with Amazon."
4,Thermostat does the job,"I've had my thermostat installed for approx. two weeks now and found that it's doing what it's supposed to do - I don't have to mess with it, I leave it set, and it just handles it. It's nice to have my furnace shut off at night and come on right before I go to work, and on the weekends it just keeps going all day until the time I set. One less thing to remember. Don't forget to comparison shop at local outlets..."
3,Not-so-Hot Termostat,"This thermostat was easy to install, though you will have problems connecting it if the wires coming from the wall are short.The unit's programming functions are uninspired. There is a set calendar of week days (Mon.- Fri.) and weekend days. So, if you work Tues. - Sat, you're out-a-luck. For the week days, you can set times and temps. for waking up, leaving for the day, returning and/or going to bed. For the weekend, you only get waking and sleeping settings. This rigid schedule does not take into account that you may stay-up later on Friday night (because it's the weekend), and that you are not likely to stay up late on Sunday (because it's a work night)."
5,Works as designed,I purchased and installed this item several years ago. It has done what it is supposed to do. I will echo a sentiment I read that you will have some difficulty installing it if your wires do not extend very far out of the wall.
1,Avoid this book.,"I could ingest 5 pounds of paper and excrete a better book.The author, at a MINIMUM, should have put some ""You code should now look similar to this"" areas in the book. He just blurts out snippets of code and its just a miss-mosh piss poor attempt at teaching people the craptastic technology known as SharePoint.Get an Unleashed book or something from Murach if he has it."
4,OK as a quick start,"Overall it provides a very good quick start to writing web parts. My one gripe is that they include ""Bonus Material"" that can be downloaded when you register your book with them (ie: give them all your personal information) such as chapters on ""Using the WPPackager Application"" and ""Using External Resources"". Just what I want, to print out material to stick in my book. It makes sense to have the examples and sample web parts available for download but chapters of the book should be published with the book!!!I had hoped this would be more like an O'Rielly Nutshell book which are generally short on blah blah and long on reference material. Unfortunately it gets verbose in many places and only provides reference to the most commonly used objects, methods, and properties.All the same it pulls together enough information to get you started quickly in a small enough book that you can actually use it."
2,very Simple,"The book covers the fundamentals of web part architecture very well. This book is essentially a ""guide"", does not elaborate on programming techniques in tricky scenarios that a developer may encounter."
4,Excellent easy to read book.,A good book to read to get the basic idea of how to build SharePoint web parts. Good examples that are easy to understand. Together with additional resources on Windows SharePoint Services 2.0 and SharePoint portal Server 2003 this book enables you to easily create custom web parts. Recommended together with the Microsoft SharePoint Products and Technologies Resource Kit.
5,Lost for words,This is the best book I have ever read it enables you to see the author and his family how he sees them have read it too many times to remember and always makes me laugh out loud and also shed tears
4,Brazilian surf music... no... really!,"Os Ostras""Operacao Submarina""(Abril Records, 1998)----------------------------------------Ska-tinged, surfy, power-pop indie-rock from Brazil? Yup, you betcha! It's cool to know that there are bands in Brazil that play this style of music, although it's not something you couldn't hear plenty of places elsewhere around the globe. Os Ostras play well, though: bet they were fun live, too! The first song, ""Tudo Pra Mim,"" is a blast! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Brazilian Music)"
5,An amazing book!,Well written and makes the reader feel on a personal level with the village and the happenings in Longbow village. It was impossible for me to put this book down. Just the drama of the whole situation happening had me unable to stop reading it. Ive read a lot on China and a lot about the revolution and this book should be a must read for anyone wanting to understand China at that time and the need to destroy feudalism. The personal stories and relationships and drama written in this book make it almost like a story book where I was cheering for some people and against others... Read it you won't be disappointed
1,Thinly veiled propaganda,"This is a view of the Chinese revolution by a sympatheic American observer. He is so enamored by the Communist ideology that he barely passes comment on the horrific things that happen:1) The villagers quickly find that the better off peasant women take much more torture to reveal their money than the men do;2) Repeated rapes of upper class women are dismissed as ""lapses in discipline"";3) The village Party leaders get their share of ""thought reform"" in a preview of the cultural revolution that will shake China in the 60's.Worth reading to see just what Communism was really about, from someone who thought it was a good idea. Makes you wonder what he left out."
5,Candidate for the most beautiful piece of music ever written,"I believe that track 5 of this CD, ""Bete..."", is a candidate for the most beautiful piece of music that Bach ever wrote, and therefore for the most beautiful piece of music ever written."
3,Better off without it,"I disagree with Mr. Winfield on one point: I don't think this is a great addition to any collection. If one is a fan of Ms. Battle, by all means get it; but I don't think this issue does full justice to J.S.Bach's glorious music."
5,Soaringly Beautiful Bach,This is one of the finest renditions of Bach arias I have heard and was my introduction to the perfect soprano voice of Kathleen Battle. Perlman's violin blends and entwines with Battle's voice to produce soaring and perfectly balanced music that is inspiring and uplifting. Not a disappointing moment in the whole recording.I would recommend this album to anyone who is venturing for the first time into the realm of opera and particularly soprano voices. This is music straight from the soul that any serious classical music lover will immediately connect with.
3,Hard to Unwrap,"I was looking for an environmentally friendly choice that did not have either a plastic or cardboard applicator. From the reviews as well as the product description, this seemed like a great option. I would have given it a higher rating, however, I find that the outside wrapping, especially when I am in a rush, can be impossible to get off. Once they improve this aspect, I would increase my rating although I will still continue to purchase it. It is comfortable, just as good as the less environmentally friendly products, and a worthwhile choice."
5,Noticeable improvement switching from o.b.,"My nether parts are much happier with these than with o.b., which has in recent years made some changes to their tampons. The past couple years using o.b. tampons, I've been having yeast infections after most periods, and tampon removal near the end of my periods has been painful. Since buying these tampons a few months ago, I'm not having these sorts of symptoms so far. Planning to try their pads now too."
2,"i like that it's all natural, but",they are hard to unwrap! it's very annoying sitting in the bathroom struggling to open your tampon. i don't recommend them.
3,autechre curated,"i'm writing this review to provide a fair balance to the previous moaners...It's not the ""ultimate mix"" but there are many good tracks--especially the rap (I mean hip-hop) there are some stinkers in there, but i would recommend buying it used just for the various baddass cool keith and public enemy. the only thing that really bothered me is that the actual autechre track is pretty lackluster, dont buy this if you want to hear autechre, buy EP 7 instead."
2,great packaging...not much else,"Nice packaging is about the only compliment I can give this double disc. A compilation from a party ""curated"" by Autechre sounds like a dream to me, but it ended up being one of those rambling, boring dreams that makes you think, ""What was the point of that?""The purely electronic portions of this CD basically center around retro/electro stylings. Such songs have never been my thing, and these are about the worst of the bunch as far as I'm concerned. The highlights of the set are definitely the hip hop songs, but those are also less-than-phenomenal.Even though this set is bargain priced, save your money."
5,great wipers,I've been using these for years. They match my carbon fiber dash kit and work good as anything else in my opinion.
1,This cd is the elevator music of ballroom dancing.,This cd is one of the worst cd's I have ever bought. I was very disappointed with this purchase. There was not one single song on there of any quality. It was like listening to elevator music. I would not suggest that anyone buy this in hopes of increasing their ballroom dance music collection.
1,Stop the cycle,"I am on a personal crusade to save dancers and music fans in general from wasting anymore money on this bad, bad CD. Dance Instructors beware! This CD has the tacky music box, canned, elevator loop track sound so common in seemingly bargain dance CDs. Okay. Strict tempo?--this is. Easy to hear the tempo and beat pattern?--Yes. I suppose you might want that for the strictest of dance practice type scenarios (very hard of hearing little old ladies who really want to get it right). I know my students would find this music lackluster and dull, and it would certainly be a bad idea for the energy level of any dance class or dance party. Possibly useful for people having a hard time with finding the count of the various dances included, but generally a very, very poor choice for enjoyment or performance value. This is, however, exacting tempo for American Standard in Ballroom. You can find many, many, excellent selections of all of these music styles elsewhere."
4,Material strength,"I found the Ladder Lugg easy to put on and off and it held my tools very well. The draw back I experienced was that two luggs snapped while putting them on. The design is great but I don't feel that the plastic compostion is strong enough. I did not apply a lot of force in securing the lugg to the ladder, I only snugged it up!"
2,rauncy rockandroll,"If you like raucy lyrics were all they know is beer and sex you will like this cd.If you like a rauncy singer in the vain of motherhead youll like this cd.If not stay away ,my opinion dont buy it."
5,"This was an intense, thought-provoking novel.","Walker gives a personal, human side to the Civil Rights activism of the 1960's. Her tales are ones only a participant of the period could relate, and she speaks to a wider audience than just women or African Americans. It delves beyond black and white tv footage of Dr. King and SNCC leaders and let's the readers see inside the minds of those ""living"" in that period."
2,"I have to agree with Reviewer no. 10, Jess D., and Jade Patten","""Sad valor"" in someone's eyes? A character who ""doesn't know exactly what constitutes begging""? Come on. And those are just two examples of Walker's writing getting in the way of my enjoying the story. The only parts I liked were when they tried to recruit people to vote; that's where the heart of the story was for me, and that was only a few pages' worth."
5,Amazing!,One of the best books I have ever read! This book should definitely leave a permanent mark on the Afican American Literary Canon. Alice Walker has an incredible story and journey to share. This book is perfect for any research on cultural studies or feminism and gender theory!
2,A Problematic novel,"Meridian seems to be a loose collection of events from the life of a female protagonist we can neither admire nor totally despise. The reader is led to believe early-on that the protagonist is a strong civil rights activist whom people admire and celebrate, but her much of her life is spent running from responsibility (i.e. abortions, moving from place to place). Later we become suspicious of the author's motives -perhaps the book was written to elicit sympathy instead of insight. In the end we are left with a novel that is little more than an amateur's manuscript someone was afraid to edit."
2,A boring book that I wish I never had to read.,This book started out slow and didn't get much better as it went on. I have a month to read it and every time I picked it up I couldn't keep reading fo more than several pages. I thought this book was very boring with very few interesting parts and I would have never read this book if I had a choise.
3,"sorry, only so-so","I had high expectations - Sinopoli was a talented conductor - and some of his other dvds available here are described as ""artsy"" projects that combine musical shots with nature, or other scenic footage. So This one is pure concert, and it seemed like a better bet. Too bad it is a rather stiff performance, and the sound isn't great. On the concerto, the soloists are very out front, and dry sounding, like they are too close. (the opposite of my usual complaint). And on the Brahms second - I just don't hear any blend in the orchestra, and Sinopoli seems to really play it very straight. I know it might not be fair, but I pulled it off and put in Vienna with Bernstein - and the 1st 30 seconds of the same piece was like day and night. I'm not even comparing conducting styles here - the entire tone and blend just seems to be in another league. I'm always interested in different versions of the same works - but this one is not too enjoyable."
5,25ft HDMI Cable,"The cable was received when stated, about 4 days, and it was just what I expected. The quality of my video using the cable is excellent. I'm not sure how a cable purchased at a store for $200-$300 could be any better."
1,Category 1.3b not,"I bought a Toshiba SDK990 DVD Player with 1080p Upconversion and needed a HDMI 25 footer. Bought this, it worked for the first time, but never again. Thought it was the player. Got another one. Same problem. It never sees the HDMI, so one could never even select a HDMI mode. Tried the 6 foot cable provided, and it worked fine. So either it isn't 1.3b compliant (that was the spec of the 6 footer) or the crimp is bad. Needless to say, not impressed."
5,Computer TV Hookup,Easy to use and allows the entire room to view what is on the computer screen. Great for sharing vacation photos and for teaching computer skills.
3,Does Not Work for 720P or Greater,Works great for resolutions of 1080i or less. Does not work for resolutions of 720P or greater (i.e. 1080p).if your ok with 1080i and need the length than this is the cable for you.
4,Works great,This is a great value for a long HDMI cable. I used it for running through the wall from my receiver to the TV and it works great. This is not the highest quality cable out there but I have not seem any picture quality or audio problems with mine.
2,"Not a Category 2 cable, do not buy for 1080p","Like others have written this cable does not work for 1080p. The reason for it is that it is a Category 1 cable. I should have checked before I bought it but that was my fault don't make the same mistake. If you are purchasing for 1080i then it works great. Also with this cable length if you do not receive a signal you might need something to boost it like a signal extender or a powered hdmi switch. When plugged directly into my PS3 I have no signal, but through my HDMI switch the TV will pick it up."
1,DID NOT WORK,I read the reviews but I didn't listen. This cable did not work with connecting a laptop to a TV. I guess 25ft is just too long. I have a different 15ft HDMI cable that works just fine. oh well.
5,As advertised,I have no complaints with this cable. There are no noticeable effects from the length of the cable in terms of audio and video quality.
1,DOA,"I ordered 2 cables. First one was doa. Second seemed to work fine for about 3 months. First, I thought I had a problem with my Onkyo receiver,(which is not even 2 years old)then I decided to buy some different cables. Turns out nothing is wrong with my receiver. You may want to look elsewhere for cables."
2,defective,"Product shipped quickly, ordering was easy but cable was defective. Installed cable and would get intermittent video. Returned and purchased cable elsewhere."
2,short life!,"It worked for a while, but then it started to disconnect and finally died! If you move or connect and disconnect this cable often, then it will become unstable. It is good cable only for static and permanent connections."
1,So much static,"Used this for my pc to tv connection and it was horrible. I've done this setup before when I had the two closer together and everything worked fine. When I used this cable, however, it didn't output sound and the video output was horrible"
1,bummer,"Cable worked for 4 months before failing. The connectors appeared intact, it just stopped working. Unfortunately it was out of warranty by then. cheap cord, buyer beware."
5,HDMI Cable,This thing has made things much easier and more convenient! I now no longer have a real need for a DVD player! :-)
2,Does not support 1080p,"I think the cable is a great deal, but buyers should know that it does not support 1080p. I'm using it with a Sony Blu-ray Player, Denon AVR-2311ci receiver, and an Optoma HD20 projector- when it went from the Denon to Optoma, trying to play a BD at 1080p- nothing. Tried several different HDMI outlets, and also used other cables (15 ft)- other cables work. other than that, it's a great deal for the price if it fits your needs and equipment."
3,Good but missing audio,"I know this was my fault, but this cord doesn't support audio when you're connecting a laptop to a TV. Other then that it has great quality, very long to be able to put things where you want them to. Definitely a good buy if you only want to show video."
1,where is it?,I'm completely sick of this.It has been now more than 6 months and I did not get this caple!!
2,fuzzy picture,"Cable worked fine from computer to tv, but produced snow when used from blu-ray player to tv"
5,25 ft HDMI cable does its job,I bought this cable to provide HDMI signals from instructor laptop computers via an adapter to a big screen plasma set used in a college lab. The cable had to be long enough to dress around the teacher's work area and feed up to the wall-mounted TV. The cables came in with timely delivery and worked well as received. They have worked well in that role for the 1-1/2 months we've had them. This was a good purchase for us.
1,Doesn't work with up-converted 1080p signal,"Unfortunately, this cable wasn't able to handle a 1080p up-converted signal from a Denon Blu-Ray player, although it did handle native 1080p signals and also lower resolutions. Another brand cable I tried did not have this problem."
5,GREAT!,"I have two and use them in my basement. ZERO problems. I connect an HD direct tv receiver to a 1080p projector with one and a blu-ray player with the other. Since this is in my basement and the projector is mounted to the ceiling I needed some pretty long cable. I could have gone with 15 feet, but no sense cutting it close. I can't see losing any picture quality even with the extra 10 feet. So the theory of ""the longer the cable the less the picture quality"" must not be that extreme when I have 20/20 vision and my 42"" plasma and LCD tv's upstairs look just the same with at 3' hdmi cable."
4,Great HDMI cable!,This HDMI cable works great. Love that it is so inexpensive...why buy something that costs more! Been using it for over a month and have not had any issues so far.
2,Lasted about a year,"The cable worked great for about a year, but now it flickers in and out as if there's a loose connection somewhere. I guess I can't complain for the price, but now I'm looking for a replacement."
2,Do not expect these to last!,"Great price, good picture, but do not expect these to last. I ordered 3 and 2 out of those 3 are already broken. One came apart at the jack and one is turning everything pink. I would expect to get more life out of these cables considering they are never moved, but what do you expect for the price?"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"Believe the other negative ratings, dont do what i did and think the product will work for me. Took 7 days to deliver, and once i got it, it did not work. I bought it to connect a laptop to a flatscreen tv. No signal recognized by the TV. Played with it for an hour, never worked. I tried a 4 ft HDMI i had and was able to make the connection. PROBLEM was definately in this product, not computer or TV. I guess there is a reason HDMI cable is so expensive. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT....."
1,Snap!,"Snap! That is what happened when I moved my cable box a couple of inches today. the cable had plenty of slack, the sheer weight of the cable snapped the connection."
1,Video snow,"Snowy video on hdtv, tried it on my projector but it couldn't seem to lock on the signal because it was too weak (would find 1080x1920@60hz, then tries to ""perfect the image"" at which point it starts searching thru the source list again. around and around). (video sources tried were PS3 and Directv hd-dvr) 25 feet is a long distance for hdmi, so if you're going that far, I'd recommend a higher quality cable. In general, cable quality is fairly irrelevant for pure digital like hdmi, but that's for 10 feet and under. 25 feet is pushing the limit, so I may have to break down and go monster.But hey, at this price, it was at least worth a try."
1,beware of these cable,I ordered two of these cables. Both had poor connectors and were loose when connected to my stereo. I had to throw both of them away as they would not hold contact.
1,Broken after few months,HDMI connection keeps dropping with diffrent types of playerschanged to differnt cable and all issues are gonewill never buy from this saler again
2,Good Price?,"the shipping was 10$ more than the cost of the cables!! 2 sets of two different sizes, 20+$ and the shipping 30+$..not a good deal at all, and I couldn't see the shipping until the credit card info went in. thumbs downnot shopping cables HERE again! i would rather pay too much upfront in a store!"
1,"Great cable, except for one thing....","It didn't work. I plugged the cable in, and... nothing. I tried different HDMI input, and still nothing. I finally found that I could sometimes make it work if I fiddled with it a bit while the DVD player was running, but if I turned the DVD player off and restarted it, the cable would go back to not working.I tried a different cable to make sure this cable was the problem rather than the inputs on the TV and DVD players, and everything worked fine. This cable was definitely the problem."
5,HDMI cable,This was a very good purchasing experience. I have no issue in recommending this vendor for any product that they offer.
3,Cheap but works,"Such a great price, I honestly could not see a difference between this cable and my 100 cable. It doesn't look like it is the best quality but it performs just fine."
4,25 ft hdmi cable,excellent buy. would have given 5 stars if i didn't have to trim the large plug for it to fit into my computer. other then that i couldn't find a better buy on line. and i looked
3,Not very soft,"I got this as a shower gift and was definitely pleased with the quantity of items. However after washing everything in Dreft, I realized that the fabric isn't very soft. Plus the burping cloths seem a little superfluous - after all, most people just use cloth diapers. All in all, I like the set but wouldn't register for it again if I had the chance."
2,thin fabric,"I registered for this set, and am disappointed with the quality. The towels are so thin! They barely soak up any water on my daughter. I would definitely not register for this again."
2,what's the point...,"What I don't get is, why spend the money on a 13 piece ""bath"" set, when six pieces aren't even bath related... i.e., when was the last time you fed your baby during his/her bath? I have four kids and have never needed bibs or burp cloths during bathtime. Seems to me money could be better spent elsewhere. Also, fabric is not very soft at all, and is very thin."
3,Too complicated,"It works well enough and cooks fine, but my family has not taken to the ""high maitenance"" of this unit. To use the auto buttons you have to always consult the manual, so instead, my family never uses those buttons (which defeats all the benefits of the convection options). Also, we are always forgetting to ""boost up"" the popcorn (you have to raise up microwave popcorn onto an overturned pie pan) which means our 1st batch of the night typically gets ruined."
5,This is a work of art!,"This ""microwave"" is a work of art. I've grilled portabello mushrooms in it, I've heated casseroles in it without it drying out as it usually does, and I toasted a french loaf in it. I'm going to try baking a cake in it next. This is SO VERSATILE! You do have to take the time to read the manual, but once you do, it's amazing all the things you can do with it! The screen will ask you questions, such as ""how many slices?"" for pizza, or ""how many cups"" for reheating casseroles. It is so amazing! Get this for your kid in college instead of a regular microwave!"
3,It functions as reviewed,"I read all the reviews and had great hopes for this item. I have been disappointed and it doesn't pop popcorn well at all. Convection oven works, and so does the grill but is not easy to clean if you are doing steaks or burgers (items that spatter). The microwave does behave ok, but you need to adjust times and always use a dish, since on the metal tray alone it takes much longer - a microwave thing, I think. It's useful enough to keep, but I would not order the same thing as a replacement. The compu functions I have tried don't seem to match my needs and it's complicated to figure out which option to use - constantly looking at the manual for reference. Defrost works pretty well. If I can figure out how to get popcorn popped, I might give it a 4 star."
5,Exceptional Deal!!,We bought this as a Christmas present for my mother-in-law as the microwave she had since 1981 finally quit. She loves it!!! She said she may never have to heat up her big oven again! The unit itself walks you through each function every time so you can't forget how to use them. I have owned a Sharp convection microwave since 1984 and only had to replace it with another one (only updated) just this past year. This is a must have!!
3,Wouldn't buy it again,"I purchased this microwave in February, 2010. The one I had before was a GE and it lasted only 2 years. Fortunately, I had bought the extended warranty from Home Depot when I bought it although it was a huge fight to get them to honor it, but they finally did and they sent me a gift card for the entire cost. I did a great deal of research selecting this one. I think I read 300 reviews of many different brands before settling on the Sharp Convection. It was more than I wanted to pay-over double my last one, but what sold me is that I can bake in it and do more than microwave. I like it so far-it's quieter than the GE was and seems faster although the wattage is lower. I hope it lasts longer than 2 years because I am not buying any more extended warranties.UPDATE: November, 2010: It's okay but be prepared to wait much longer for things to be mircowaved through. The center is useally still cold after the recommended amount of time. Figure adding on another 2-3 minutes."
4,GREAT COMBO OVEN,"This product replaced TWO others: a microwave only, and a toaster oven. Although this is a convection oven, I don't notice that any foods cook quicker than they did in my old toaster oven or regular oven for that matter. But it does do both microwaving and regular cooking well, and it's sooo convenient to have only ONE thing on my counter instead of TWO!! I do recommend it, and KUDOS to AMAZON once again, I ONLY order online from them, always quick deliveries with NO problems. This is one of MANY items I've purchased from AMAZON including my beautiful new 52"" Samsung LCD TV, which I received in perfect condition and saved a bundle of $$$ on! Thanks, AMAZON, you have a REAL and LOYAL FRIEND here!"
2,Only lasted 5 years!,This was my second purchase of the same item. Had the original for close to 15 years and loved it so replaced with the same model. It just died! I couldn't remember how long ago I got it. Was shocked to go into my order history and see it has only been a little more than 5 years!!! I have given up on Sharp. Had a t.v. that died in less than 5 years. Contacted them. They could not care less. I will be replacing this item with another brand. Both televisions and microwaves should last longer than 5 years!!! They've lost me as a customer.
4,Sharp R-820Bk 900-Watt Cu Ft Convection Microwave,"I like it but was a little disappointed in the size of the interior. It works great, tho."
1,6 min on high to heat water - 5 min popcorn,"Was very disappointed with this machine particularly after reading the glowing reviews here. Perhaps we got a lemon, but the microwave on this puppy just didn't cut it. We couldn't even heat water in it! 6 Min on HIGH to make hot water! Didn't pop popcorn... etc.Just plain ol' didn't work...Caveat Emptor"
3,It works.,"Wish the controls were easier to use and see. Capacity is small. Containers slip around on turn table. Haven't tried baking in it, it's been too hot."
1,Sharp Microwave,"The unit was damaged when received, and was returned for a refund, Received a full refund in a timley manner"
4,Great Little convection oven,"I didn't need a microwave, but wanted a good oven to bake hot rolls and biscuits at our camp rock house. This oven works! It has many features that I don't need at the moment but have baked several dishes and they have all turned out nicely. It is hard to find an oven somehere between a microwave and a toaster oven but this oven serves the purpose perfectly.Thanks, Mossy"
3,biased American oboist,"I got this recording solely for the oboe concerto. It's interesting to note the differences in the sound quality on the Viennese style of oboe compared to the typical Loree...for me, the tone seems too spread and squawky. The interpretation isn't horrible, but it isn't great either. Overall, it just didn't excite me the way other recordings do. I still think it's good to have this recording just to get a comparison...the Mozart is an essential part of oboe rep. and the more interpretations you hear, the better."
4,Folksy Fun,"I'm not too familiar with the Fruit Bats, but this album has been fun. I particularly like the song ""When U Love Somebody."""
4,"Modern pop, sort of folky, easy-going","The songs on this album remind me of folk-rock from the 1960's. Not the John Denver or Peter Paul and Mary style -- think in the direction of the more thoughtful Beach Boys tracks. Most of the instruments are acoustic, but there are some electronic sounds in the mix there too. The songs are kind of downbeat but very easy to listen to, with lyrics you'll listen to two or three times to let their meaning trickle in. I'm new to Fruit Bats, and I'll be checking out their other albums, which also get good reviews."
5,One of my favorite albums of all time,"This is the kind of album you toss towards someone if they love catchy produced pop music in the Beach Boys/Beatles kind of vein. (but with an indie sound) The Fruitbats with the help of Phil Ek made themselves a fine album on this one as every song grabs ahold of your ears and doesn't let go. Smart lyrics, great instrumentation and strong songs make this ---in my eyes--- an essential album.Eric Johnson also has the kind of mellow voice which is quirky enough that it blends fantastically with the music the Fruitbats churn out. An album you cannot go wrong with purchasing..."
3,"Good style, but not developed","First of all, I like this album. The way they use Simon and Garfunkle-esque acoustics with a touch of synthetic sound is great. Plus, their lyrics have good meaning. But this album isn't finished. None of the songs are fully developed. They either have verses but lack a refrain or vise versa. Some people may think that's a good thing (you know, all non-conformist), but I think it's annoying. The songs are either repetative or prolonged. Rock music just shouldn't be that way. So, if you find it cheap, go ahead and buy this album. But, if it were me, I'd wait until the next one."
3,torn between three and four stars,Ok I have to give three rather than four stars. (Id like to give three and a half!)There's lots to like about this album. Some nice country tunes and beach boys style melodies. Some of the songs could have done with more work however. The frustrating thing is that there are some beautiful lyrics here but maybe only four or five lines in a song - the rest either being filled by instrumental bits or repitition. Its a pity because there are some gems on here.I would recommend this band and will look out for more of their stuff even though this album could have been better.
4,Good Holiday Romance,I enjoyed this holiday romance. It had well developed characters for a short story. My only negative point was that it was predictable. Still enjoyable!
3,Predictable but enjoyable,"CAROLINE was a classic, predictable historical romance. The hero, Alec (Aka Sacha), was handsome, powerful, rich, a war hero with excellent connections and a known, acknowledged rake who is determined never to marry. Caroline, (aka Caro), the heroine, was gorgeous, innocent yet sexy, fun-loving, and sweet 18-year-old. A major twist comes at the beginning of the story when Alec finds an unconscious Caroline dressed as a boy in the Connecticut woods who, when awakened, has lost her memory.The writing was fairly smooth, especially for a debut novel, and the editing mistakes were minor and didn't interrupt the flow of the story. The characterizations were quite well-defined with distinct personalities and the dialogues, especially the banter between Alec and Caro, were a lot of fun to read.Altogether, I found this book to be enjoyable and I would recommend it to people who like this genre. If I could, I'd add half a star to the rating for a grade of B-."
1,Did not enjoy and I couldn't finish the book,I did not enjoy this book to the point that I didn't even finish it. I did give it several chapters though. What I didn't like was how the characters spoke it was a huge turn off for me. It seemed unrealistic in their speech and words used. Maybe others will enjoy it but I didn't.
3,long,"This story was far too wordy. I'm sorry to say I still haven't finished it yet. Thankfully, it was free."
2,Typical historical romance,"Typical in that it takes characters with modern attitudes and inserts them into a historical setting, which seems researched to about the level of a high school term paper. In it's favor, there are only two attempted rapes and the heroine spends less time unhappy and confused than usual (surprising, given that she has amnesia, but who cares when you're in love?) For better research and more realistic attitudes, try Georgette Heyer. G.H. doesn't do sex though. But if it's sex you want, I have to say that the sex scenes are pretty bland and repetitive in 'Caroline.'"
5,Highly Recommended,This was the first book I've read of Cynthia's. It was a wonderful book! I love the relationship between Caro and Alec. Very romantic and real. The historical story behind the romantic story was very well done and I could picture it all in my mind. I would love to visit it all again and again!
5,Keeps your interest,There are waves of built up pressure followed by release of some sort. The action and the love scenes were very well written. I really enjoyed this book.
4,Kudos to the author.,I read and loved Cynthia Wright's books when they were originally published and am delighted to have the opportunity to reread them. And kudos to her for not asking $9.99 or more as so many authors do. Now I can afford to buy and enjoy all of her books.
3,Ho hum,"I picked up this 1st book in the Beauvisage novels at a bargain price and picked up the 2nd novel as a free offering. My rating would have been more accurate as a 5 out of 10 or a 2-1/2. I found 'Caroline' to be predictable and plodding. The writing did not engage me and, other than the grandmother, the main characters were not memorable for me. I didn't hate the story, and I somehow hope that the 2nd novel in the series will pick up the pace a bit. I am not in any hurry to read it, however."
2,Eh. It's ok.,Not the worst I've ever read but hardly the best either. It was ok for a free ebook. If recommend it.
5,Historical Romance at it's BEST!,"Caroline is an extraordinary love story during the end of the Revolutionary War.""Caro"" and ""Alec"" are unique characters. You can see the changes in their characters from start to finish. Although Alec puts up a good fight to the very end where he finally accepts his fate. You will also see some Historical Heroes in this book ie George Washington and others. I also loved the Christmas traditions portrayed in this story.Cynthia Wright tells a tremendous story. Her characters come to life. Don't miss this one!"
2,Difficult to follow,"I did not like this textbook at all. It included a lot of good teaching material, but it was very poorly organized and difficult to follow. I much preferred Sol y Viento."
5,A Drive By Wedding,"Strong central characters, just enough humor at just the right moment to make you unable to set it down."
4,This is a top 20 game for 3DO,Ok so you want more shockwave? Shockwave 2 much improved over the first one. I would say this is the 11th best game for 3DO. The control of your ship can not only cross the line but can get you to throw you controller more then once. It is however a very good game and one that is worth the purchase.
4,Otherlands review,"The Otherlands accessory chronicles three different, formerly unexplored areas on Krynn. They are Chlorine, which lies approx. near the south pole of Krynn; the Spine of Taladas and Selasia, which presents the home of the Irda; and the home of the Dargonesti (Watermere), which lies very close to Taladas. This is a very fun supplement, but also fairly dark and dreary when one imagines the land of Chlorine. The major complaint is one that is fairly constant in the Dragonlance Saga; the lack of a continous, clear, unbroken history that would agree with the novels."
4,Great Gift,"I bought this for my mother for Christmas, she loved it. She wanted more copies to give to her friends."
1,For True Beginners,"I don't consider myself a home expert but may reconsider after reading this book. There was very little that was new to me and much of it was common sense. When I did come across something new, (home repairs for example) there wasn't enough detailed information. I needed to consult other resources. I think the book tries to be everything to everyone. I much prefer Hints from Heloise, Decorating for Dummies and, the Readers Digest repair books."
1,Stupid.,"...If you like cutesy decorating ideas, you might like this book. If you're looking for practical household tips, there's nothing beyond the obvious and some tips are very impractical. For example, they advise you to keep candles in the refrigerator so you can find them easily in a power outage. I don't know about you, but in a power outage, the last thing I want to do is open the refrigerator and spoil my food. The book tries to cover everything under the sun and, as a result, isn't really good for anything."
2,Outdated,"This book contains some rather outdated concepts. Such as advising you to store garlic in oil. This has long been warned as dangerous due to potentital food poisoning, yet the book does not include any caution about this practice. The book also tells you to extract egg whites from passing the egg from one shell to another, which again is not an adviseable method (I checked my Better Homes & Gardens book and Cook's Illustrated).The index of this book is wrong a lot of the times."
5,Exceptional Resource,"This book is excellent. I bought it several years ago for myself, and my children call constantly to ask me to look up solutions for their household challenges. I decided to buy three copies---one for each of our adult children. They, like we, will find great hints and tips to make their lives easier.An excellent reference for efficient living."
3,fun and sexy,"I always like a story about a bad boy! Who don't right?I was not 100% sure though when I first started to read The Bachelor what I was going to think about It. It does have it difficulties though. A few times, I was thinking that it could be better and others I found my self lost in the pages.There are some very interesting characters in the Bachelor.I found it a fun and sexy read in the end. I am going to have to pick up some more of these stories."
2,IS THIS A CHILDREN'S BOOK?,"Like the other readers, I was anxious to be part of Kelly's 'club'. I was also excited to hear that Kelly had chosen, a fun,light, beach-toting PAPERBACK book. (Hardcovers are ridiculously expensive and not worth the monthly commitment)Yes , 'page 166' and the other two 'romps' were well written but what about the remaining 300 pages? I think those pages were written by Judy Blume. ""Are you there God, it's me Carly?""It was hard to truly develop a reader-character relationship with Raina's sons without repeatedly saying to yourself, ""Aw, COME ON!"" Come on, who would really believe, without a blink of the eye, without any valid professional back up, that their mother was dying! And a COIN TOSS!? COME ON!To Carly's credit, I did finish the book; it wasn't THAT bad. But you know what they say, 'bad press is better than no press'."
1,WRITING SO BAD IT'S UNREADABLE,"I LOVE Kelly Ripa. Watch the show every day. Also really like light fiction, romance and sexy novels. Couldn't wait to try this book. The writing is SO atrocious, so banal that I could not read it. Every scene is predictible. Sentence structure is 2nd grade level, writing actually repeats itself from paragraph to paragraph. Two pages of sex doesn't cut it, and even that is poorly written. Kelly, I've lost some respect for you. You ought to fire your research staff and get some college educated people helping you. Sorry folks, I wanted to like this. It's worse than Jacqueline Suzanne."
2,Disappointing.,"I just got around to reading this book long after it was talked about by Kelly Ripa. What a disappointment! I expected more after all the hoop-la. The characters are likeable (thus the 2-stars), but there is no plot. The whole thing is shallow. I wish I had not bought the trilogy before reading the first one."
2,There's much better stuff out there than this,"I have to agree with most of the other reviewers, this book is just not that good. Yes, the love scenes are hot, but they come with a price - 319 pages of flat characters, hokey dialogue, and a cheesy plot. I am a huge fan of contemporary romance and am very forgiving of the genre, but I am pretty embarrassed that I read this whole book."
2,Too simplistic and predictable,"The Bachelor was a tad trite and not exciting in the least. There are so many romances going on in the book, the story gets a little carried away trying to make everyone find their ""true love"" in their own small town. If you like predictable, happy romances then this is a good get-away-from-reality quick read, if you are looking for something with drama or the unexpected then I would stay away."
1,Awful!,I too didn't bother to finish it - It was just plain bad. Try a Jennifer Cruise instead - lot's of laughs and very sexy.
3,Middling,"As romatic comedies go, this one was OK--not too terrible, but nothing at all that distinguishes it from the pack. The plot was a bit contrived (which is OK in these types of novels, you expect it), but coupled with unimaginative characters behaving in unrealistic ways--it's just an OK read. I was surprised because I have read a few of Kelly Ripa's other picks and while none of them are War and Peace, there is usually something about them that distinguishes them from the pack. I would say, don't go out of your way to find this book, but if it finds its way to you (like when you are stuck on a long plane ride) it won't do you any harm."
2,Never quite makes it,"The love story between Charlotte and Roman is interesting, even touching at times. But the selfish motivation of several of the characters, including the leads, is off-putting."
2,Grimacing still,"I wanted to like it, truly I did. But it was such a mesh of unbelivability. Let's see, Charlotte poses for him in near nothing after 10 years of absence; her pathetic excuse for a mother is quickly forgiven all, as is her father, for years of selfish emotional abuse; they are both mature adults yet know after one night of sex that they can never live without the other; it was so pathetic and horrible. I just kept grimacing at the whole thing. Gave it two instead of zero stars simply because Carly phillips herself is the author."
3,"Cute, but a tad boring","Roman Chandler, a 31-year-old journalist and self-proclaimed lifelong bachelor, loses a coin toss with his also single brothers and finds himself on a quest for a bride. Beautiful Charlotte Bronson broke his heart in high school but will their newly-kindled romance be enough to have a Chandler saying, ""I do."" Add to the mix a panty-stealer, a meddling mother, and some sexy crochet. Chaos ensues...Though the Chandler boys had interesting, well-developed personalities, the other characters seemed shallow and unrelatable. The book offered a few laughs and some steamy scenes, but the plot was predictable, and frankly, pretty boring. There are two more books in this series, which I hope will be more entertaining."
2,The Bachelor,"Too much boreing internal agonizing by the main characters. It drags out the storyline which could be told in half the words. The female lead is dumb if it takes her a whole book to realize that she'd like to travel. Roman's mother is self-centered. The reader doesn't have to be reminded which brother is youngest, oldest,etc."
2,So Unrealistic,This book was so boring I could not get past the second chapter. It is so unrealistic to believe that a mother would trick her son's into thinking that she is dying. On top of that who really believes that 3 single brothers would do a coin toss to see which on has to get married. Save you time and money. Don't bother with this book.
2,The Bachelor,I found this book hard to finish. It was boring and silly at times. Since this is the first time I have read this author it will be the last. I read a lot so almost didn't finish and go to another book. But thought if I kept reading it would get better but it didn't.
1,Can anyone get published?,"First off, 1 star is far more than this piece of mindless drivel deserves. I expected a fluff novel, in fact I wanted a fluff novel. I didn't expect to read the equivalent of a high school creative writing assignment. This book was boring and pathetic. There is only so much I can suspend belief about. These people all need to move as far away from one another as possible.I can say without a doubt that Carly Phillips should find another occupation. Maybe the GAP or something. Or maybe I should become a writer because apparently they're just handing out publishing contracts to anyone."
1,Not for me....,"This a poor attempt at a romance novel. There is little of interest - it is deficient in both plot and characterization. But most of all, it was the author's lack of style and simplistic sentence structure that drove me away. I'm sure that many people who make few demands of a book will enjoy it; I did not."
4,Put A Smile On My Face,"I have to say for a ""Summer"" read this was an enjoyable book. The premise is about three bachelor brothers. This particular book focuses on Roman. Their busy body, but good natured mother, is ready for them to settle down, get married and give her a grandchild. She fakes heart trouble to get them to feel her days are numbered.The book is written in such an uplifting fun manner. Even though there is some deception is the book it is done in a manner that doesn't hurt anyone. There is sex in this book but it's not overly explicit.There is also a ""panty thief"" sago that is entertaining even if it is pretty obvious who is doing it.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a quick, romantic enjoyable read.I'm looking forward to reading the next book."
4,Good Fun Reading!,"The Bachelor By Carly Phillips is the first of the Chandler Brothers Trilogy. This is one of the first contemporary novels I've read (I'm more of a historical romance person). This was a fun read. Nothing earth-shattering or profound. It's a cute story about a mother and her three grown sons. Mom wants all three sons to get married, settle down, and give her grandchildren. However, she has to feign an illness just to get the ball rolling with her three sons who have no interest in getting married at all. ""The Bachelor"" starts with the youngest named Roman. The second is, ""The Playboy"" the middle son, Rick, and ends with ""The Heartbreaker"" the oldest son, Chase. I am currently reading ""The Playboy"". So far so good. In conclusion, ""The Bachelor"" is a four stars. Only because there are some parts in the story that makes you want to roll your eyes...haa! haa!"
5,Just How Funny Your Kids Really Are,"My husband and I are reading this book out loud to each other each night after we tuck our kids in bed. We usually end up laughing so hard we almost fall off of the couch. It's good medicine, that book. Sandi takes situations that you may never have thought of as being funny and opens your eyes to just how hilarious it all really is. The fact that she's been through the preschool stage three times herself gives her vast experience to draw from and write about.Mostly, I feel like I am reading a comic strip about our own family life because the things she describes are the very things we experience over and over again and never even thought to ask anybody about. It does wonders for my attitude.I think anyone who is in the process of raising a preschooler NEEDS to read this book. It's like the glass of wine at the end of the day, and perspective for the days to come."
5,A Must Have Guide to the Pre-School Set,"I recently read this book in anticipation of giving it to my nephew and his wife, who are in their mid-thirties expecting their first child! I LOVED it! It was a splendid trip down memory lane for my own adult daughter's childhood, and I simply howled throughout the whole book. Sandi's comments are dead on accurate with just the right dash or dollop of humor, which is a must have as we raise children and get down to the nitty gritty of the crazy yet brilliant things our offspring do. This book is a must have along with Spock and Brazelton, and the one that will help you know you are perfectly normal and you and your kids will survive!!"
5,Comforting and funny to any mom,"What a funny read...Very well written and witty. Highly recommended from a mom who RARELY reads parenting books because they seem so boring.... This one is original, supportive and well worth the time. You'll feel a little less crazy, neurotic and guilty as a parent after you read this one."
5,stink free and lasts all day,"i have searched the globe for a natural deodorant that lasts all day. this is the only one that i have found, and i am in love. it works all day and keeps me smell free. it's the only deodorant i will use. i live in FL and that means it is HOT and i sweat A LOT. this keeps me fresh! it doesn't stop the wetness, but that is not important to me. it is chemical free, and one bottle lasts several months."
3,Works Great but....,"I've found that it forms crystals in the bottom of the bottle that clog the nozzle :/ Rinsing the nozzle or shaking the bottle prior to spraying helps, but it's annoying."
5,"Bleeding, Drugs, Vitamins","Dr. Armand Quick, a trained chemist, brought a new perspective to the medical profession. In 1932 he used his chemistry background to develop the one-stage prothrombin time test, or Quick test, which is still used to monitor anti-coagulation treatments. For the next 44 years he worked in the field of clotting diseases. This book is something of a compilation of the results of his 40 years of study. The five chapters in this volume are titled:I Vitamin C - The Dynamic Vitamin That Changed HistoryII Vitamins That Keep Us From Bleeding to Death - C, K and QIII Hemophilia - Toppler of DynastiesIV A Silent but Serious Disease - TelangiectasiaV Salicylates - God's Gift to Man for Pain"
1,Novel Masquerading as Bad History,"Readers need to remember that this is a historical novel, not straight history - whatever the author's pretensions. Besides over-idealizing Talleyrand (perhaps to serve the author's own obvious political biases made clear in the Foreword), the book has many gross historical errors of fact that I wouldn't tolerate in a sophomore term paper - and that could have been avoided simply by careful fact-checking. P. just doesn't seem to take history seriously. (The list of reference sources at the end has many more items on antiques, fashion, and architecture than on political or diplomatic history.) As for the writing, some of it is on the level of a teen-age romantic novel, and elsewhere it changes to an ordinary historical narrative - so it's not always clear just what authorial voice one is hearing. This is very sloppy history indeed - the author should stick with Tom Clancy. (I'm a professor of history in Portland, Oregon.)"
2,Harsh string sound,"The phrasing is beautifully done, and the tempos are just right, but the string sound on the Divertimentos is harsh and quite unpleasant. My Paradigm Signature speakers don't lie."
5,Read it and see Jesus today!!!,"Very simple and easy to understand, you can grasp the truth in this book. I suggest for all to read it. The book will show you the truth and allow you to see the richness of God's love and the work of the Master. Read it and see Jesus today!!!"
2,not enough poetry!,"There's somewhere around a third (or more) of this calendar that's information about poets and quotes by poets. That's a bit too much for me. Docked an extra star because the selection is uneven, mostly American, and the whole thing is badly organized."
2,Keep trying,"I bought the poetry calendar for poetry. I know I am not alone in my disappointment in the lack of poetry. I do not want biography. I do not care what some poet has to say about another poet. An occasional quote from a poet is acceptable. In the last 4 days, there has been one poem. There is a poem tomorrow, but the day after that is more commentary.I will not buy this calendar next year unless there is an open one I can preview."
3,hi tech,"When you download maps you must also download active sync. Then, it gets more complicated. We got into the car and it will not accept addresses - so we were told to remove everything from our computer and reinstall. If you are good with computers and GPS systems this may not be a problem. We like to go everywhere. And could not figure out how to work this. If you are not very good with technological things your best bet would be something with pre-loaded maps."
4,"well, they started good","I like these @ first, but then I just stopped reading them, and I have no idea why.Klaus is the middle child in this trio. He is amazingly smart. Violet can build inventions out of anything! And the youngest person in this trio is a girl named Sunny, who has amazingly sharp front teeth.I love the plot of these books. Count Olaf is a great character and I love to hate him!I juat have to read the twelfth book and then I've read them all. I definetely plan to read the next book in this series."
5,Literature for Children,"Daniel Handler is one of the best children's authors around. He has a turn of phrase unique to himself and he treats children as young adults. This is literature for the young and is a worthwhile addition to your library. I bought these to read for myself, and am now waiting to introduce them to my children."
4,An exciting adventure,"The Lemony Snicket series takes you on an exciting adventure through some of the troubles the Bauldilare children are having. Its ral to life troubles which some of us can relate to are essential to my intrest. The Series of Unfortunate Events takes your emotions from happy to sad, from excited to bewildered, and from scary to astonished. These books get two thumbs up."
5,The Cumbersome Collection,"Hey,don't be discouraged by all the ""don't read this there is only woe"" that Lemony Snicket sets up. These books are AWESOME, and it is a good kind of misery, if that make sence."
1,Disappointment,"I've always been a Tintin fan, and wanted to buy a book for my son. However the format of this book was disappointing, as the original (single) story books were more like A4. The book (with three stories in one) is just too small. It's not the fact that there are three stories all in one volume, it's simply the size of the book. Why was it changed? If you're thinking of buying one of these ... check the measurements! The're not the same size as the originals."
2,Way too small,"My wife became a life-long Tintin fan 30-odd years ago when my son was growing up. When I saw this 3 for 1 book advertised, I thought it would make a nice Christmas gift for her. As others have stated, the print and pictures are much too small to enjoy compared to the originals. Granted, Amazon specifies the book size, but who checks that? I just mailed it back for a refund."
4,Timeless adventure tales,"Always a hit. My son loved these stories growing up,so now I buy them for his kids ! Great stuff."
4,These books are pretty good.,"I read these books when I was little and I absolutely loved them! But now as I have gotten older and more mature I have engrossed myself in more exciting books with more complex plot structures. They are an excellent way to start children off reading, but I hope that, like me, they recognise when Tintin becomes too childish a book with a fairly boing plot."
2,Didn't Work for our purpose,"Bought this for my sister who has lower back issues. Even though she's pretty small, it wasn't long enough to reach her lower back. This is designed for someone who wants to use it on their mid to upper back. She also found the ridges on it to be uncomfortable."
1,Not enough stuffing,"I was pretty disappointed with this product. For one thing, they didn't put enough herbal stuffing in it. It seemed to be only about half full. Secondly, what little there was all fell to the bottom when placed around the shoulders, which kind of defeats the whole purpose. I sent it back.As an aside, I was quite impressed with how easy Amazon's return process is."
2,Junk!,"I am not sure why I am the only one writing a review that thinks that this beverage tub is poor quality. Something is not quite right about the metal. It looks more like it was painted with metallic paint than galvanized metal! Looks cheap and it wobbles. I was a little embarrassed to have this at the party I was hosting. If you are looking for a NICE, good quality beverage tub.... steer clear."
4,Gentle Humor,"It's been ages since I've read such a well-written, humorous yetdeeply felt novel. Here's a high school teacher who's wise and caring, a part of his North Carolina rural community without beingcondescending toward his less educated neighbors. The funny scenesrise naturally and easily from the main plot during this one day.The satirical and serious sections likewise flow smoothly as theday's action moves on. Chappell's novel also makes a wonderfulgift for those who tire of depressing or violent stories."
5,A joy of a book.,"I love this book. It is as beautifully and strongly structured as a spider web, and yet also as lightly."
3,i fell that this book was pretty good,"fred chappell's ""brighten the corner where you are,"" was a very good book, but the reason i gave it 3 stars is i didnt like the ending!"
3,A Face To Face,"Myopic verbosity abounds. All this book is saying is let us start somewhere. Is it not better to do something, or shall we just arrogantly complain and spout off with no suggestion of solution? If you are not part of the solution, you are part of the vastly growing problem. Thusly, a plethora of global businesses e.g. (Delta, AMD, JPX, Ford et al) noted from Fortune Magazine, have recognized the importance of old fashioned face to face meetings in a continuum of raising precious competitive sales volume. Read this book for yourself. Make your own decisions. Important for business managers."
5,Great Book -,"Love Suzie - think she is wonderful, this book has great tips that can help anyone gain the tools for financial freedom"
5,R. Scot Evans- Equestrian Consultant,"I've followed Suze's guidelines for developing financial freedom over the years and this book came at a very important time for my family. My younger sister recently lost her husband and has two little boys. As I began the steps to move forward in showing her a way to be in control of her destiny, I gave her Suze's latest book for guidance. Along with each of us partaking in the Ameritrade savings plan to save ourselves financially, I know this book is a way to empower women on many levels.I applaud Suze for once again reaching out to the public and showing us a way to better understand our money matters."
1,Garbage,"This book is garbage. I am sorry I wasted my money on it. The tone was preachy and irritating to read...and no, I don't have PMS right now. I just found it very annoying.Many of the things she said you 'must do' didn't make sense to me - like setting up auto-withdrawal for all your bills, and paying all your bills ONCE a month. I pay mine bi-monthly.I would recommend Dave Ramsey's books on personal finance. He is 100% better, and 100% more helpful."
1,unhelpful,"sorry i spent the money was not worth it, donating it maybe it will help someone else. would not purchase another"
1,Don't buy it,I bought this book because I saw her on PBS. The book is just her speech she gives every time. I wanted the book because there was supposed to be a code in it that you could put in the computer and get a savings account that would pay you $100 after 12 consecutive months of savings. There was no code in the entire book. Her website said it was on page 85. It was not there. I read the entire book and never found it. Very disappointing considering I thought the book would pay for itself.
1,Trite,"I don't know why Suze Orman is heralded as a financial guru. She isn't. There are many, many other books that have real financial advice. This book is not one of them."
4,A concerned husband,Very well done for women. Covering a topic that they should really understand better.
4,excellent read,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. There is a wealth of information for women to learn about finance and to learn how to secure their future.
4,WOMEN AND MONEY,"the first CD was alittle boring because Suze spent time trying to convince the listerner why they should follow her recomendations, but after that she shared excellent advice. I'll be listening to this set again!"
5,All Women Must Read!,"In the past, I already respected Suze Orman's financial advice. After reading this book, my respect increased even more. It was very easy to follow, and she gave websites to access even more detailed information throughout the book.Even for knowledgeable women like myself, I learned a lot of new, valuable information!I strongly believe ALL women can benefit from this book. Any woman who currently allows her spouse to have control of the finances needs to read this! This book will give you specific reasons why you should be involved in your finances for many good reasons. I recommend all women should go out and buy this as one of the best gifts you could ever give yourself!Catherine Jean Schoenbauer-Humphrey, author of When the Smoke Clears- How to Survive and Be Better Off With or Without Your Cheating Spouse"
4,Women & Money,"I just got this book, through Amazon, yesterday and have only scanned through much of the book. Right now, from what I have scanned through, it's just basic information to me. I watch the Suze Orman Show every week and nothing, it seems, from scanning through the book is any different from what I hear on the show every week. One big plus to this book is the Save Yourself Plan where you can open up a savings account, put a minimum of $50 into a savings plan and at the end of the year get $100 added to the account. I think that by offering such a plan would be an incentive for people to want to save as this account has a high interest rate compared to most banks. I think this is a good book but I really feel like I've learned much more from watching the show."
3,Great book for women with minimal financial background,"I bought this book with the intention of getting ideas to better control my personal finances and retirement planning. I have a financial background so some of the content was just too basic for me. However, I have tweaked my personal finances to become more inline with Suze's suggestions. I think this is a great book for my step daughters to read."
5,Great instructional book,This is just the book I had been waiting for. A step by step instructional financial map for all women. Thank you for writing it!!! I am reading and implementing every words. I am on my way to financial security and I could never be thankful enough.
4,Easy to understand and empowers you!,"I really like this book; much easier to understand than her prior books. I commute to school, one hour each way, so I am enjoying the audio book. Lots of great advice, and again, in easy to understand language."
2,Suze is not good at giving advice on stocks and am not thrilled about the Stock Trader she picked for incentive.,"Being truly anxious to read Suze's book, I went from cover to cover in a less than an hour. She had some good points, however, her information about stocks was not what I expected. She is not as savy on this issue as she could be with more education. Her code in the book for her web site is okay but, her web site I felt was not user friendly.However, This book could be of interest to younger women, just starting out building their finances.After having read the book, and scanning it, I've not looked at it again.One other item, the incentive for collecting $100 from an investment company of Suze's choice, did not excite me.This is just my opinion on the book; someone else may not agree, that's fine. We are all intitled to our opinions."
2,Not the best I've read,"I love Suze Orman and as a 26 year old woman I was more that excited about learning how to control my own destiny by learning all I could about my money. The problem....I would like to enjoy it before I retire. Suze should change all the names of her books to. "" Suffer now, Retire rich part 1, 2, 3 and 4"" because that's the philosphy of her books. I am more interested in learning techniques that can produce results in 3-5 years. 35 years is too long to reap the harvest. This book has it's place but it didn't help me much."
5,Priceless reference for women,"Every woman has a responsibility to educate herself and her daughters in money management, financial responsibility, and financial investment. When I was growing up this was a ""man's business"" and no one talked to girls about finance. We do ourselves and our daughters a disservice.Ms. Orman's newest book takes her wisdom and proven advice and applies it to a gender desperately in need of it. A valuable reference for those who want to know more about money matters and how to teach it to our children. As usual, Suze knows best! Use this book to build a better future for yourself, and to plan ahead for your children!"
5,A must read for everyone,To cover all the basics and more in an easy to read book about what everyone should know about money is a must read for not just women. I found this book to be extremely informative and should be required reading for all.
3,A step i the right direction,I watched Suze on Oprah and felt she had something to offer so i bought 2 of her books and gave them to my wife.I recommend that any husband serious about having a partner who complements their efforts in getting the family from a life of subsistence and consumption to financially independent to do the same.An enlightened and empowered wife is the first step to a blissful life.
5,It's like Suze Orman is my own personal financial consultant.,Suze Orman tells you exactly what to do with your money if you don't know. She explains everything in layman terms. If you are just getting by and don't know how to save money then this is the book for you.The real beauty of this book is she is really looking out for your best interest with complete honesty.
5,Women & Money by Suzie Orman,I bought this book for my daughter to understand her finances better and I think it is hekping alot. Very good book and author....
2,"It's okay, but if you've read her other stuf.....","I like Suze Orman to a point. This book is okay, but if you have read her other stuff, then information in this book is nothing new. Sorry Suze, but I know you need to keep making the money.I would also like to comment on the fact that the paperback edition and the electronic edition are the same price. Suze, you may want to talk to your publishers Cindy Spiegel and Julie Grau about this one. I won't be purchasing ""The Money Class"" until the prices comes down, if ever. Or, if it is free at the library....."
4,"Suze puts the ""E"" in empowering with this book","Empowerment is what women need and want. Suze delivers this and more, Her Save Yourself Plan is nothing short of Brilliant!!! Now there are NO excuses for a woman to say ""poor me""."
5,Empowering,This is one book that every woman should read. It's easy to understand and right to the point. Suze's no-nonsense approach to gaining control of your finances is a real eye opener. The book is entertaining as well as informative.
5,great tool,I bought this book for my wife who agrees its a great tool. Its not all you need but a great point of tart. years ago YF&B changed my life hopefuly this book will do the same for womeny wherever they are
3,Hopes this helps...,"I hope that I am able to remember what is taught, so that what I have read will help me control my spending and understand how to invest correctly."
4,Good Read,I think Suze Orman did a great job on this book. I felt the beginning of the book was a bit drawn out however she made it up with her 5 month financial plan. I learned a lot and I think this is something woman should take a peak at.
5,Simple and clear,"Suze provides simple information about how to take charge of your finances. She doesn't try to overwhelm with information, but rather selects the key pieces that are important to know. I love that at the beginning of each chapter, Suze provides a list of things she wants you to learn from that chapter, and at the end of the chapter, she provides a checklist of actions that need to be taken. It's clear what needs to be done and it feels really nice to be checking the items off that list!"
4,Good Advice for Women,"I loved this book and found the tools she put on her website specifically for this book to be extremely helpful.I read this book after reading the 9 Steps book, and it is mostly repeat information, so if you are looking at these two books, just buy one or the other."
5,"'Must Have' for everybody, women and men!!!!",I wish I read this book nine years ago......I would be so much further ahead financially!!!
3,GREAT IDEA BUT MISSED THE TARGET,I am a fan of Suze Orman and work as a financial advisor. I was very excited about the book (being a woman) but was disappointed by the lack of relevent information. The book is basically the same info from her other books just put in a different order. Also the Ameritrade deal really bugged me (i can only invest thru my firm because of SEC rules)I don't believe that there isn't a deal on the table. I mean TD Ameritrade gets the plug and Suze gives them it exclusively with no string attached? Suze..you have educated your fans enough over the years for us to believe that you would make a deal like that and not get ANYTHING.
4,Strong material,Suze Orman provides an excellent perspective on women and power/money. Very useful information with interactive website. Nice.
5,simple grace and financial freedom =happiness and balance,Simple Grace: Living a Meaningful Lifeif you want happiness and balance in your life take control with suze's new book combined with simple grace - living a meaningful life. the journey is gorgeous and you wil be financially free and spiritually content. stop by www.bethjannery.com-beth
4,Another hit for the financial planning guru,"Suze Orman books are usually very informative and this book is no different except that it is tailored to women. It also offers a different perspective than her previous books about money. She has great insight into more than just financial matters, or how non-financial factors influences our relationship with money. While I don't particularly find value in strategies with money in her books, I do think there is spiritual value in her genuiness,and insight and willingness to share. I would recommend this book to women who have so much and at the same time, nothing."
4,Quality Read,I love this book! It helped me get refocused on my goals! It gave me the tools needed to get back on track & take control of my future.
5,Wholistic financial advice and realistic goals,"There are two things I like most about Suze Orman and this book. First, her financial advice is comprehensive. It's a big subject and she's got most the bases covered. Second, the book's approach to goal setting is realistic and very effective over time."
5,very helpful book,"This book is truly helpful and has advice that you can actually implement. For anyone looking for the online access code for the women and money book, its EIEIO."
2,Pretty Disappointed,"Well, Suze Orman is a financial guru, that's true, but is it just me, or does she think the entire world is full of morons when reading a book? This book seems to not be geared towards women, but to 2nd graders. I found it far too easy to follow without a lot of great information. Yes, we should take control of our finances, yes, we should have a will and living trust, yes, we should save for retirement. Of course we SHOULD. But how can we when we can barely make ends meet? The truth is, we can't. This book does not show you where to get the money, but what to do with it once you do. And she doesn't fully explain that money market accounts, the stock market, the economy isn't a for sure thing and that you usually get a 9% rate of return, but the truth is, you could also lose all of your invested money as well. I don't really recommend this book. I recommend Frugal Living for Dummies instead."
5,Best Advice About Money and Life Management,"I'm using this as a text in an Intro to American Business course that includes a section on Personal Finance. Go online and take the Orman assessment to uncover the 5 areas you need to concentrate on. There is a 5-month plan that will straighten out your finances, credit cards, FICO score, forms you should have completed (will, treatement wishes) and investments. Practical whether you're 18 or 80.Orman said women don't understand finances and so they glaze over them. She's right. And we can't afford to be Bag Ladies so listen up both men and women. Our friend Dean read the book while he was visiting us this summer."
4,"Helpful Even If You Don't Have Money, Yet!","I love this book! I've always liked Suze (although I was never crazy about her presentation style) but I also thought that you had to have some money to work with before you would benefit from anything she was saying. This book is great because it gives you things to start doing today, no matter what your financial situation is, that will allow you to be in a better situation 6 months from now. She also stresses the importance for women to have their own money! You just never know what the future will hold, and there is no way that any woman should be totally dependent on her partner!"
4,Self Help but Clear,"Its still suprising how many people don't realize or understand financesthis is a great book for the novice to get an easy understanding of where you should be at 20,30 or even 50!"
5,an eye-opener!,"This book opened my eyes to really look at and do something about my financial situation. Everything Suze says is great advice, and the links to her website are invaluable! I recommend this book to anyone who wants to take control of the money and finances, and the section on wills and trusts is priceless!"
5,Must have for all women!!!,"I have known about Suze Orman for quite a while now and have many of her books, etc. This new book of hers came out at a perfect time in my life ... it is helping me to start saving for my retirement and helping me from the start to learn about how to work with my money. This book will help people who have absolutely no knowledge of what to do with their money to people who have experience. The book is worth much more than the small price it costs. I would recommend this book to all women and feel that it is actually a MUST HAVE in a women's library."
1,Not Rev. Awdrey's Stories,"These are not the railway series stories. They have been re-written to go with the 'Thomas & Friends' franchise. Rev. Awdrey's introductory notes have been rewritten, too.We bought this book to replace ours when it wore out from being read so often, but we will have to return it, since it is not the book it claims to be. The Fat Director/Fat Controller has been replaced by 'Sir Toppam Hat' and the trucks are now freight cars.If you are looking for 'Thomas & Friends' stories, then this will probably be fine for you, but if you wanted to read to your children the stories that Rev. Awdrey wrote, be aware that these are not it. You can find them here:Thomas the Tank Engine: The Complete Collection (Railway Series)"
5,Correction,"A previous reviewer said that this was a complete collection with original drawings - and while it is with original drawings, this is NOT a complete collection. It is fourteen complete books of the twenty-six written by Rev. W. Awdry."
5,A great bedtime story book for young children.,"I purchased this book for one of my children to read to them before bedtime. As it stands now, it is more fun for him to read to me. Great book for spending quality time with family."
1,Thomas the Tank Engine Story Collection,I can't say whether the book was good or not because we didn't read it. The book came damaged. The last 10 pages were not sewn in so I returned it and asked for a replacement. The second came in the same condition. I sent it back and asked for a replacement. I later found out that Amazon will not replace a book a third time so we never got the book. Not a very pleasant experience.
5,A fabulous keepsake for children!,"My four year old son is an avid Thomas and friends fan, complete with the videos, take along trains, train sets, etc. He loved this book and we read 2-3 stories every night until we finished it. He carried it around and would sit and pretend to read to himself, looking at the pictures. It was a great introduction for him to chapter type books, and has sparked an even more avid interest in books and reading than he had before. This book has already suffered some wear, but was well worth it and will be a treasured keepsake for a long time."
5,My son loves this book,We first rented this book from our local library over the summer. After having to check it out twice bc my son loved it so much we decided to just go ahead buy it for him. I was surprised at how little this book cost bc it is a very large book and has lots or stories. This is the perfect book for any little boy who is a Thomas fanatic!
2,Can The Railway Series Get Some Respect?,"A nice idea, putting a bunch of the Railway stories into a single volume. But in order to do this, they have to shrink, crop, zoom and slice up all the great illustrations, which I find to be much of the appeal of these books. The stories are charming but, let's face it - the writing has always been more or less serviceable, and the illustrations really help to make the characters pop. It's not difficult to track down the individual books in this series, with full-sized images, on the cheap. It would be nice if the publisher made it easier by keeping them all in print, but I think they enjoy pushing the newer books that are more closely tied to the TV series and toy line.It's worth noting that the text is changed ever-so-slightly too, mostly for political correctness and consistency with the show."
2,Not the original text!,"This book is handsomely produced, and the illustrations are lovely. But the text seems to have been altered from the original. In Rev. Awdry's original books, wasn't Sir Topham Hatt referred to as ""the Fat Director,"" and, after the railway is nationalized, ""the Fat Controller""? But in this book, he's Sir Topham Hatt from the beginning. This might not bother most people, but I think the book ought to come with a warning."
2,Be wary,"My nephew loves Thomas the Train and I thought this would be a great gift. While the stories and pictures are great, I was surprised to see pages start falling out after opening it read some of the stories to my nephew. It may have just been my copy, but it was still embarrassing for my gift to fall apart from being opened."
2,Not great for 2-3 year olds,"I bought this book for my son for christmas because he and his dad have wore the pages off Thomas' Big Storybook. They love reading a new story every night and thought this would be perfect. He is not at all interested in this book. The pictures are too small for a child his age. We prefer Thomas' Big Storybook because the pictures are much larger, and help tell the stories."
5,A story for everyday,This is an amazing book. I didn't realize it was so large. It seems there is a story for everyday of the year. It is a beautiful keepsake. My daughter reads a story to my grandson every night and he really looks forward to it. He keeps the book right next to his bed.
5,A must have!,"I bought this book for my son's 3rd birthday present. He loves trains and his favourites are Gordon, James and Thomas. He insists on reading at least two of the stories before going to bed. It is a fabulous book but I wish Sir Topham Hatts have been kept as the Fat Controller."
1,Lots of stories but....,My child loved the Thomas line but we started noticing that there was a lot of crashing and bashing and anger between the engines so we stopped reading this book as well as tried steering him away from all things Thomas.
4,my kid loves it,it is a great collection of railway stories for fans of thomas the tank engine and locomotives alike. it will definatly have a place on our bookshelf even after my kids are all grown up.
1,Boring,This book is collecting dust on our bookshelf. It's long drawn out and BORING! I have tried to get my children to sit down to read this and it's just missing something.
1,Dark angels took the fun away,"Repetitive, simplistic gameplay consists of running along linear levels surrounded by invisible walls, and repeatedly pushing the kick button to eliminate countless enemies running towards you. Luckily the game has only six levels, so the pain will soon go away."
1,Dr.Benjamin Hobhouse,"This is a book which simplifies QFT in a way not suitable for learning the real principles and theoretical foundations of QFT. It uses the synthetic path integral approach only, whilst the canonical approach is more appropiate to understand the foundations of QFT. For this, it is not enough to know how to write down the path integral and calculate scattering amplitudes only. It is good for an experimentalist, who wants to apply the theory of QFT to his measurments and vice versa. Who wants only to have a glance at QFT (including recent developemants) without being too superficial, the book of Michele Maggiore or the book of Thomas Banks are more useful, exactly because they present both approaches. For a major in QFT the book of George Sterman can be recommended."
3,Possible a slow starter,"I have read this book and find it to be inadequate in the first chapter. Not for beginners who actually want to learn. Maybe its good beyond the first chapter, but if you dont get chapter 1, I dont know how one can proceed. I fails to explain spin, and the rules behind its addition. Maybe its obvious once you know it, but if you dont... Basically he failed in his attempt to explain the fundamental particles and the rules behind their comination."
4,Written With Uneven Quality,"Normally I would have given this book a three-star rating if it weren't for the number of interesting topics that it presents that usually don't find themselves in a QFT book: topological aspects, supersymmetry, nice approach to Dirac's equation, derivation of reduction theorem from path integrals only.The presentations are written with uneven quality. Ryder's treatment of supersymmetry is excellent as an introduction. The first chapter on the other hand is entirely forgetable. The mathematics is too loose and somewhat sloppy at parts. However almost every field theory text I've come across suffers from this criticism. (It would be nice to see a QFT book written for physicists but by a mathematician.) Explanations and insight into QFT are scant; the book focuses mostly on formalism. The best thing about Ryder is it covers a great amount of material in a short size (487 pages) and in a very readable form."
4,Pretty good but there are better ones,"This was my first text in quantum field theory. And learned a great deal from it in grad school. I bought several QFT books since then. While this book is detailed (semi-proof of renormalizability of QED etc.), it doesn't really discuss the concepts behind it very much, like what is the physical meaning of 'second quantization' and why do it at all. A better introduction, I think is Kaku's Quantum Field Theory, with more legible typefaces, clear exposition of the concepts so you will remember things better later on and lots of examples. Some might say it's easier, but kaku's book taught me something beyond the technical aspects of QFT. But still, Ryder's book is much better than a lot of other books on QFT."
5,Basic notion of Quantum Field Theory,"This is an ideal one for a new comer in the science of Quantum Field Theory. It discusses the transition of Quantum Mechanics to Quantum Theory in great detail. The book teaches Path Integral Formalism and also throws light on Modern concepts Ghost Fields etc. The book also explores the concept of function and functional. Obvoiusly it does not go to discuss Functional in such a detail as that of the book on QFT by P Ramond. The book also throws light on Gauge Field Theory, Symmetry Breaking and Electroweak Interaction. Altogether the book is one of the best 'buy's for a Graduate Student in Physics. Personally I have been refering this book right since Graduate days till today for last tweleve years."
2,wha happened?,"overall a good book. it makes you think. but its clear the authors are more objective than the editor, who seems to have a real axe to grind like the bible is secondard to her feminist podium. that's tiresome. also never heard of her. is she a scholar who doesnt publish or jsut waiting for the next feminist fad to happen? the quality is uneven i suspect it's a collection of her friends only. the carole meyers book on women in ancient israel is far superior and not ideologically angry."
2,Jacquard???,"Comforter is a bit small for a queen sized bed; could slide off. The bedskirt also appears to be too small. I put them on a full size mattress, and find they fit right. The shams fit a regular sized pillow.Workmanship appears good. It is attractive. But nothing too fancy here.My main gripe is that this has never been within 100 miles of a Jacquard loom. Here's the M Webster definition:jacquard weave: an intricate variegated weave made on a jacquard loom and used for brocade, tapestry, and damaskThis fabric is strictly print. It is a high-resolution print, but still a print.A true jacquard might justify the otherwise laughable ""list price."" As a print, this stuff is worth about 1/5th the list price, counting the little pillows and stuff."
4,MALIBU SHORES FLOWER,I AGREE FOR BEING A QUEEN SET THE COMFORTER IS A BIT SHORT FOR THE BED .OTHER THEN THAT I LIKE IT. VERY QUICK SHIPPING.
2,Lack of Steering Wheel Support A Huge Disappointment!,"I'm a native of Indianapolis and am a fan of Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) and like PS2 racing games. I enjoy racing around IMS in my PS2 Nascar Thunder and Formula 1 games, so I was very excited about IndyCar Series when it came out and I could race the 230+ MPH vehicles I watched many times in person over the years on the track that I know so well.But, as other reviewers have noted, there is no steering wheel support for this game (I have the Logitech wheel, which is essentailly the standard for PS2), but I don't think that you would know that from the information on the box for the game. I can imagine the look on my face when I plugged in my wheel and... nothing.The game plays OK with the standard controller and the graphics and sound are decent, but it just isn't the same as driving with a well-calibrated wheel in your hand. I'll make sure I research my next racing-related product first."
4,A pure sim,"This can be a very difficult game. The level of precision you need to drive at incredible high speeds around these ovals, where only a touch can finish a race, is amazing. And if you blink during a race you may be hosed.Graphics and sound are just okay. A lot of anti-aliasing going on. But your spotter is dead on and the cockpit view is blinding with 22 other competitors around you. And the car set-up is very detailed. This is definitely a niche product and many will get frustrated. But that just increases the satisfaction when you succeed.This is simply the best simulation racer on the PS2. I don't include GT3 as a sim because it offers no cockpit view, no damage modeling and horrible AI. You can't just plow into the leader at the last turn and come out with a win like in GT3. You will be out of the race in this game. This game requires a lot of work... and for that Codemasters should be applauded."
2,"No Wheel, No Fun","Unless someone can figure out a way to use a PS2 steering wheel with this game, I would NOT recommend it at all. The graphics are ok (6 on a scale of 1 to 10), but without the use of a steering wheel this game is useless. You'd be better off playing F1 2002. The graphics are much better and you can use a steering wheel."
3,DECENT GAME MISSING MANY DRIVERS THOUGH !!!!!,...THE GAMEPLAY IS OK THE GRAPHICS ON THE OTHER HAND COULD USE SOME SHARPENING THE LOOK LIKE NIN 64 OR SEGA DREAMCAST MAN THATS TERRIBLE WITH TODAYS DESIGNS AND THE ENGINE CAPABILITY CODEMASTERS SHOULD BE ASHAME OF THE END RESULT.I WAS PLEASED WITH THE AUTHENTIC STYLE OF QUALIFYING FOR THE RACE ITS A CHALLENGE BUT AGAIN FOR A GAME THAT HAD SO MUCH POTENTIAL IM SORRY TO SAY ITS NONE THE LESS THANANOTHER RACING GAME OR SHOULD I SAY INDY TRAINWRECK.
3,Maybe ok for Pollini fans...,"Well, if this recording is any evidence, it's no urban legend. Pollini's rendering of the scherzi is percussive, uningratiating, coldly brilliant, and as dry a performance of Chopin as I could imagine. I don't get it. Maybe you gotta be under 50 to be a Pollini fan. There are surely better CD's of this music around...Rubinstein, to be sure. Not that I don't respect Pollini...his Schoenberg is another story entirely."
2,POmpous Photographic Works not capturing the space experience.,"I have purchased several books about Getty Center for my design research. Overall design of the architecture is, with no doubt, a masterpiece. However, the pictures in this book are dead, out of context, no night pictures, no interior pictures, with no scale senses...I mainly blame the photographer/editors for their poor selection of their pictures.The pictures are in high quality, but edited to remove the real sense of the presence. Not even showing the entire presence of the building that you can find even from google Satellite picture.I still recommend anyone to visit LA, visit Getty center and your experience or any picture you take there will be 5-10 times better than what you see in this book.This should just sit on your coffee table to flaunt your architectural taste, but not for the architects."
5,El Paso In Pictures-Wonderful,"This is a wonderful book on El Paso and the cover is just beautiful. The cover artwork is done by noted artist Frederick T. Carter, who passed in May. Frank Mangan, the author, does a wonderful job depicting El Paso. Great Read!!"
5,Best Hikes With Dogs: Arizona,"Very insightful, included maps which were very helpful. described the terrain and included elevations to determine how hard the hikes were. Great suggestions all around great guide!"
1,Incomplete,"I purchased this product and found that only 70-odd minutes of Goodfellas was present. When I buy collections like this, I expect the films to be complete, because that's what I'm paying for. Instead, I got only the first half of a film.The set was sealed completely, brand new, never been watched before.It's ridiculous."
1,"""I'M SORRY""","""I'm Sorry,"" What money grubbing person put this album together? It is NOT John at his finest, nor his worst, there is no way you can rate his voice, his feelings or emotions, this is a total insult to those of us who followed this lovely man from early on. I'm sure he would NEVER have allowed this to be released. He certainly gave 100% of himself to his craft, and causes. I know his early works, and the latest. His voice became stronger, his concerts, though few and far between in later days were better than ever. Each song in this release deserves better than an under water sound, quality is what he deserves and truly the best we can lay tribute to. I have EVERY piece he released, though much repeat, when he grew his music grew with him, this for me is such a slap in the face. ""Im Sorry"" is all I can say."
2,Re-recordings plus the Windsong album,"I was also fooled by the cover into thinking this was a collection ofthe original hits; I got a revised version, 2 discs--one containedthese re-recordings and the other was his album ""Windsong"". At leastyou'll get the original versions of ""Calypso"", ""I'm Sorry"", and ""Fly Away"" on THAT one (plus a fun tune, ""Love is Everywhere""). For the re-recordings, his voice definitely sounds older but not too bad, and his revised versions of ""Thank God I'm A Country Boy"" and ""Sunshine"" are not too bad. But again,re-recordings. (I wound up getting ""Definitive All Time Greatest Hits""after this one, and was more satisfied.)"
4,Good Rerecordings Of His Classic Hits!,"I like John Denver and It doesn't bother me that this CD is rerecordings of his classic hits, anyway I have at least 3 or 4 other CD's that have his original recordings and though they are fantastic I like this CD too, my favorite songs on this CD are Rocky Mountain High, Annie's Song, Back Home Again, Take Me Home Country Roads, Sunshine on My Shoulders, and Thank God I'm A Country Boy, I don't regret buying this CD at all!"
1,Beware! Rerecorded (mentioned in small print),"The only thing that saves this CD is the very low price. Other than that, it's a collection of inferior rerecordings of his greatest hits (look for the very small print on the back). Stick with the original greatest hits collections or find a collection that is not so slyly described."
2,Buy the original Greatest Hits,"I bought this cd for the track ""Annies Song"", which I had hoped would have been included in the original ""Greatest Hits"" package. The tracks on ""Best of...."" come across as over-orchestrated, and I don't care for the free-stylin' changes or interpretations of the original songs. One track that really struck me as odd was ""Country Roads..."" Then I realized the steel/slide guitar sound was missing. Most of the tracks are good songs, but the better interpretations of them can be found on the original ""Greatest Hits"" and the ""Wildlife Concert"". The only redeeming quality of this package is the price, but even then I would avoid ""Best of...."" You'll be happier with the original greatest hits series, and the wildlife concert collection."
3,Not the John Denver I remember!,"My first reaction was Yikes, what's this! But, the more I have listened to it, the more I'm getting used to it...but it definitely isn't the John Denver I remember."
3,John Denver,I am not happy with this one; there is too much live. I wanted the songs the way they were first sung.
5,The Best Of John Denver,"Very nice older songs on this dvd. I bought it for Take Me Home, Country Roads andRocky Mountain High, I enjoyed all the songs on this cd."
2,"Not The Original Recordings, but OK","I had expected the original recordings when I ordered this CD. These versions are ok, but not as good as the ""radio play"" ones. I listen to it occasionally, for background music."
4,Great sparing engine... not the best... My first one engine,"This is a old product, i bougth 10 year ago, nice sparing.This one is a old version of Fritz, the ELo of this software is 2300 or 2400 USCF. Internacional Master style game.This software has a nice methods to rank your opponent by ELO.If you are a beginer, start with this, you will not regret, the only thing is the poor render of the pieces (ten years ago)Parents, buy this for your kids, this program will prepare you son for Fritz software.Bye"
3,a good edition for geisha collectors,a prized book to add to my geisha book collection. HOwever it is filled with OLD black and white and coloured photos of geshia in the oldern times so if you dislike that type of giesha picture try other books.
1,These are not the original recordings!,"Yes, they got the original artists to sing their big hit songs, but if you want the EXACT songs you remember, this cd will not make you happy."
5,LOVE THIS FAUCET!,"This faucet is replacing the same one we bought 16 years ago, and we just love it. It shipped very quickly and installed easily. Love the higher faucet for getting large pots underneath and for easier cleanup. It's a great product and will last."
3,Semi adequate heart monitor,"Works fine, security part works well at blocking others in spin class but also means it will not work with most cardio equipment. Pain in the a$$ to program and set time and use. Difficult to move from time to heart function. Prompts confusing and counterintuitive. Multiple language feature annoying and difficult to follow instruction book. Had to return defective one and they sent another, no problem. I prefer my Nike C5 HRM and use it much more often."
5,Review of Atlantic R&B series.,"I am really reviewing the whole set rather than just Vol 1. I actually have the original box set with lavish book,but when the other 7 vols turned up locally recently it was a must buy. The music turned out by Atlantic is so timeless and such high quality.I think the Drifters with lead singer Ben E King are just amazing, Save the Last Dance for me says it all. Highly recommended."
1,Overpriced junk - lasted three months,"I admit it: I was foolish. I chose these shoes with the adage ""You get what you pay for"" in mind.They look quite good in the photos here, but the pair I received were not as well finished as I had expected. The joint between uppers and soles is unsightly and poorly finished. The uppers are apparently made from different grades of leather, with the right shoe being obviously rougher in texture than the left. I have managed to reduce this to some extent by regular polishing, but have clearly wasted my time and effort, because I noticed today that the left shoe's sole has split in two, right across the widest part. Not cracked, but broken completely through to the insole.I started wearing these shoes on March 2nd and today is June 11th. That's fourteen weeks at five days per week, seventy days.97 dollars worth? I wouldn't pay 20. Avenger should be ashamed."
5,Real Leather and made to last,"The days of genuine leather uppers, soles that are sewed and not glued, and general good craftsmanship for under $100 are quickly coming to an end. These are real good shoes and a great bargain for the price. They're well constructed, very light weight and very comfortable and good looking too. Hard to believe they're meant to be work shoes. Thinking of buying more pairs and stocking up for future use...(split leather, it's just not the same feel and wear as genuine leather and it's ashame that's what the term ""leather uppers"" is becoming, Google it.)"
1,Not like Mario kart like they say,"I was told by reviews that it was like a mario kart version for the Xbox, but it doesnt relate. It's slow moving and not that exciting. It would be a blast I'm sure to a kid, but not for a teenager"
3,Fun Game But Graphic Issues,"This game is alot of fun. It is based on the excellent concept of the racing game Re-Volt.On major problem is that the game is supposed to be in 720i format, which my X-Box and HDTV will support, but when I set my box to that format the game won't even load. This is a glitch, or the game is just 480i resolution. The graphics are good, but they aren't in 720i."
1,N64 has better graphics,"I rented this game from blockbuster to test it out. I had just seen the 2nd movie, which also sucks, but I thought since the movies are all about fighting, it can probably like an arcade game. But no, I was wrong. Maybe they could have made it better if they did not cram the game together to release it with the movie. I reccomend to rent it first if you are interested in it but please, DO NOT GO BUY IT!"
1,Boring!!,"I got this game thinking that there would be some major ass kicking going on as there is in the movies. It seemed okay at first, but then as I advanced through the game I realized how unbelievably repetetive and boring it was. It never got any better. This was one of the worst games I've ever played."
2,Boring..... :(,"This game is so stupid, i mean dont get me wrong...i love both the charlies angels movies but this game doesnt do them any justice. Bassically you do the same thing in evey level, fight the bad guys and then call another angel do the exact same thing.The only reason anyone should get this game is because of the animated movies they show once u finnish the level, but trust me, even they arent good enough to keep your attention."
1,Worst game ever,Totally useless game. All you do is fight the same bad guys over and over and over in different scenery. It is totally and completly monotonous. Don't bother buying.
4,Just straight up terrible!!!! - Edwin Montanez,"This is a terrible game. I hate it. All you do is fight the clone of the same guy over and over again!!! I hate it. I bought it thinking it would be good, but no. Dont buy it!!!! I am warning you.-Edwin Montanez"
1,misinformation,"If this book truly does state that there are 200 strokes cause by manipulation per year in Canada, then I would not bother wasting my time with this book.What I would rather see is a book that reviews all studies done on the subject. For example, some studies have shown that the risk of stroke from manipulation is only 1 in 1-3 million. That's less than the risk of stroke in the general public."
1,An awful read.,"What caught my eye as a potentially interesting book regarding an ""expose"" into chiropractic turned out to be nothing more than a witch hunt based on biases and misrepresentation. As I read through the chapters, I started to get an impression that these authors were willing to base gargantuous claims on little or partial pieces of evidence simply to make the book more tantalizing.Spin Doctors is a written form of Jerry Springer if I have ever seen one, but at least Jerry doesn't come across with the supposition of being credible. While his show doesn't disguise the fact that it is not to be taken seriously, I get the distinct impression that Benedetti and Macphail wrote this book with the express purpose of discrediting a profession. Personally, I did not appreciate their attempts at taking advantage of a reader's trust or trying to make money from unjustly attacking others.Unless you are interested in seeing true ""manipulation"" at it's best, I'd stay away from this book."
1,don't support this garbage,"This is the type of medical attack, that has tried to denigrate Chiropractic for over 100 years. If you hold the medical profession to the same candle, you will ignite a flame for thousands of years. I am more than a little tired of quasi- scientists trying to make a buck off of a professional."
1,Typical old-school bias against chiropractic,I couldn't help but peruse this thing. It's chapter after chapter of out-of date claims by those who simply can't accept the fact that chiropractic is here to stay and that a growing body of research supports more and more of what they do.Usual junk. Don't buy this book unless you're part of a campaign to spread ignorance and lies about something that the author clearly has a political agenda about.
1,Very poor game,"Go 15 years behind to get an idea of the graphic quality,The game itself is boring, deadly boring.waste of money if you want to have fun."
4,"indy ""out of their league"" racing","Of all the racing games I own for xbox, this is one of the worst.The graphics are chopping and not realistic looking. The cars don't handle smoothly and really don't convey a sense of realism. The accidents are very tame by racing standards. (not much damage shown).My favorite is when you pit and they need to do extensive work on the car. It looks like one of members of the pit crew is performing a ""massage"" on the brake cylinder. LOL..I didn't know that 'magic' hands could do such wonders!Overall, a sad effort for a racing game."
1,Don't even bother,This game isn't realisitic at all. When the cars crash no significant damage takes place just some small pieces fly off but that's about all.The spotters voice is so dull and doesn't even sound human. It sounds like a robot. If you are looking for a good open wheel sim then don't get this game. If you are looking for an arcade style game then you'll probably like it.If you want a realistic and fun race car game and you like turning left then NASCAR Thunder is a good game to get. Heck they even throw in a couple of road courses to make it interesting. This game can't even make that claim.I just wish they would come out more open wheel racing games for The X-Box like some Formula One games. Unfortanately Sony has exlusive rights to featuring F1 games on PS 2.The one thing that is realistic: Small crowds at each track!!
4,horrible,"First off this is Teresas' son Chris. This game is just horrible. The graphics are terrible. Unfortantly nothing eles the game as to offer is any better. I have F1 2001 and it is a far better game then this. Even if you are and IRL fan whcih I am not you won't like this game. I mean how can you make a good game that is based apon the worst racing series in the world. If you wanna go make lefts all day buy a NASCAR game and skip the road races. As for me I'll wait till the next F1 game which I hope comes soon, or even better yet a CART that that I am waiting for..."
4,Athens Guide Book,"This book is so pertinent for those people who are going to Athens, the capital of Greece. It is much more comprehensive about the city than the Blue Guide to Greece, which is great if you plan to stay in the city for awhile. Its commentaries are easy to read and understand and give you a full view of what to expect. Get it if you can."
3,biographical fiction,this book was very informative about the life of anne boleyn. It was accurate historically which is good.
3,Family History,"A very good source of info on the Luyster family of Johnson Co, IN 1830 to 1860+ Printed in 1835; Revised in 1945. Contains some typos."
4,Incredible,"This songbook has really easy songs and the sheets are clear enough so you can just play it through. Coldplay is one of my favorite bands, so I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the band and the piano itself."
2,"Skip the ""Easy"" version and get the original music","I bought this for my students who are truly beginners so that they would have some goal music. As noted, it is not for beginners. I don't think the time signatures or keys are difficult; the rhythm is difficult because it follows the notes as Chris Martin sings them. This means it's lots of eighth and sixteenth notes and dotted notes and ties. I got A Rush of Blood to the Head at the same time. This original music doesn't have the melody, it is meant to to be played and sung at the same time. It's only slightly more difficult, so I recommend getting A Rush of Blood to the Head instead of this ""Easy"" piano book. It's more enjoyable to play and sounds better too."
4,A good find....but,"It's a great book for intermediate players. I wouldn't exactly call it ""easy piano."" While the notes are easy to read and not complicated, the key signatures are what make the songs difficult. Brush up on those before trying out this book!!"
2,Not original arangements or really even close,"I'm surprised that none of the other reviews mentioned the fact that these ""arrangements"" are very different from the originals. The melody (vocals) is in the right-hand treble clef and simple base notes in the left. These are not really the chords that are played by the band, and it is virtually impossible to sing along with what is written, unless you like singing exactly the same thing your right hand is playing. And there's not enough of a chord in the left hand to fill it out if you just drop the right and sing it. I'm fairly disappointed in this. Maybe if all you're looking for is a similar sounding arrangement and don't plan to sing, then this may be the book for you."
4,A Great Buy For Beginning/Moderate Piano players,"I got this book for Christmas last year, and at this point I can play every song easily. This is good and bad. I've only taken piano for two years and found this book fairly easy. COLDPLAY is my favorite band, and their music is absolutely wonderful, but this book simplifies the songs down a bit. I eventually got bored of the simple notes that didn't impress anyone and started to change it up. This book is easy to out grow if you are still advancing in your playing. However, my friends, who don't have much experience on the piano, enjoy playing these songs. I suggest buying this if you are a beginner. But if you want more of a challenge that sounds like the actual songs, try somewhere else."
4,Interesting alternatives,"This is the second ColdPlay book I have, the first one being ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"". Comparing ""Clocks"" especially was interesting. I found their version a little tougher in some ways, and it helped me learn the piece in a new way. A very good book with well developed and easy to read sheet music."
4,Good Way To Present This Book...,"This book is laid out as you would find a comic book; many small picture boxes with callouts and conversation circles. It's very interesting to read this story in a graphic novel format. As one of the classic novels, for those who don't really like to read but love comics, this layout is great for keeping their attention. The back of the book holds notes on the story including a deeper look at the story and author, placing the story in historical context, the role of dogs in the gold rush and where Jack London pulled his source information for The Call of the Wild. Overall, this is good way to present a classic tale."
1,I hate it,This book is the stupidest book Ive ever had to read. All the people that have read are now that much dumber.
2,Gershwin's Works,"Though I do like Gershwins' work, this production of it is not good. I had the recording on a very old LP that I have listened to for years, and the difference in performance is very obvious. I would have thought the Chicago Symphony Orchestra would have done a good job with this, but it lacks the verve and power I have always associated with Gershwin's work."
4,"It works with the E815, too!","The Motorola E815 wasn't on the list of ""compatible"" phones when I bought this charger, but since it takes the same plug as the V710, I decided to take a gamble and buy it anyway.It looks like my lucky guess paid off, because this charger works just fine with my phone. It's nothing special to look at, but it's affordably priced and gets the job done. This is definately not a ""rapid"" charger by any means, though... Expect up to a two hour wait to charge your cell phone if the battery is low."
3,Not a name brand but gets the job done.,"DLN ENTERPRISES was undetailed about the product. All tehy said was that it charged, not if it was a brand name. Works good, charged my Motorola T720 and Motorola V400 in less than 2-3 hours. Both battries completely dead."
3,"nice concept, but not preschooler friendly.","thankfully, i just checked this out from the library before buying it. my son is 3 1/2 and there are many activities that just frustrated him and that were beyond his (or any other child his age's) level. there is one with a pretty difficult maze for a bee to fly through that always ended up being my responsibility to complete. this is definitely a game you need to completely explain to the child and do some reading from the screen. on the other hand, he really enjoyed and learned from some of the activities. maybe by ""preschool"", they meant 4 and up?"
1,"weighs a ton, arrived wirth split wood","Finish is cheap looking, weighs a ton, packaged poorly, main wood leg was split on arrival. Really wanted a classy looking wood high step ladder. Disappointed."
3,OK,"came on time, and was in OK condition. If it was not so heavy I would have returned it. Was shipped on time."
4,step stool,This is a very nice step stool but it weighs a ton I bought it for my kitchen and I an not sure I will be using it to much in the kitchen it weighs to much but other wise i love it.. I had to order it twice because it came broke the first time and the second one is very scratched!!!
1,Don't waste your time,"The ladder arrived horribly damaged in three different spots on the top handle. It was cracked so bad in the center of the top beam that I could actually see through the crack! It was also cracked on the right and left side of the top handle. There was no padding inside the box, so that explains it. I ordered this for Christmas for my very short mother to use in her kitchen and I was so excited to find a stepladder for her kitchen that wasn't metal. Besides the cracks, the product just looks cheaply made. Through the cracks I could see that the wood isn't solid -- it's particle. I've read a couple other reviews on this product about shipping damages over the years and I guess the company chooses to ignore that. What a disappointment!"
3,Cosco mahogany step stool,Step stool is great. Sturdy and nice looking. I read previous reviews about the heavy weight but I disagree. It is not too heavy and considering that it is a short ladder I would not want it any lighter. The color is very dark espresso and looks wonderful in my kitchen. The only reason for rating it 3 stars is because the shipping box was inadequate for protecting the ladder. In fact the package was a light cardboard and it was damaged during shipping. As a result my ladder has several scoff marks and was badly scratched during shipping. Books get shipped in heavier boxes than that! I could not be bothered sending it back considering the box it came in was basically unusable. I repaired the damage the best I could and since it is on the back side of the ladder it does not bother me as much. If you order it be aware of the shipping problems.
3,step stool,"This stepstool is very solid but is extremely heavy and difficult to move around. My idea of a step stool is to be able to move it easily from place to place. This is not the case here. This also has to be put together as it does not come assembled. I had to hire a handyman to do this for me as it was not a simple task. Had I known that it would be so heavy and unmanagable, I would not have ordered this item. I liked it for it's looks, and in that department it came through."
3,very fine except for the stickers,"The absurd number of warning stickers plastered all over this stool really detract from its otherwise handsome appearance. Don't step here! Really, Don't step here! We mean it bud, this is not a step! OK OK I get it - And some are not even placed evenly! It takes a couple of hours to peel the largest of them off....too bad.Cosco Rockford 11255MGY1 Wood Step Stool, 3-Step, Mahogany"
2,"Quick shipment, OK quality","The ladder is heavy and sturdy, but I expected the I high quality finish and it was OK."
3,Not worth the money,"This does look great and is very acceptable to leve out in your kitchen - however I ordered one - it was cracked, ordered a replacement - it was cracked more than the first - they dont pad them when they ship them - they arrive in a cardboard box so of course they get beat to heck in transit.Great product - but the company needs to rectify shipping issues."
4,3-Step Ladder Review,"Cosco Rockford 11-255MGY1 Three-Step Wood Step Stool, Mahogany 1The Cosco Rockford 3-step mahogany wood ladder is reasonably priced, beautiful, well made, and HEAVY. I'm a short female, and I appreciate ladders that are light-weight, so that I can move them around with ease. Unfortunately, this one is so heavy, I resist using it. Plus, it's wider than my last step stool, so it doesn't fit in the same storage space or in areas I used to get to with my other step stool."
2,Nice item if had arrived without 3 areas damaged,"The item is fabulous. Looks great. However there are scratches all over this item and wood pieces missing. Had to find wood stain to cover. So extra cost. Did not send back because lets be real that is more work than worth it which is sad. I work hard for my money, I expect what I buy to be in mint condition. And you can not blame the shipping company, the scratches are in weird areas that I doubt were done by shipping. Sorry won't be buying from this company again."
2,Very Poor Quality,"The above item arrived with the pkg in rather bad shape. The weight of the item made the pkg heavy and it should have been over wrapped. The step stool was not at the quality described in the many online reviews at your site I looked at before ordering. It is very poor quality with poor wood used in the construction. Planer skips, chips and poorly glued pcs of wood were just stained over inexpertly. I've ordered many items from Amazon and this is the first time I've ever received an item of such poor quality."
5,Very Useful Little Ladder,"Strong and sturdy 3 step ladder...great for getting things down off the top shelf in the kitchen, or for changing light bulbs...then it folds away flat to store conveniently between the fridge and the wall for easy access latter."
2,too heavy,"I had read reviews stating that it was heavy but ordered anyway. They were right, it is too heavy for folding and unfolding for use in the kitchen. Might be ok to leave in the closet. Brown stain was a little too red for my tastes too. Built well but not what I was looking for."
1,Heavier than advertised,"I relied on the description below (7.9 pounds), thinking this was not the heavy version reported in other reviews, but product actually weighs more than 20 lbs, making it very impractical for my use. Manufacturer should correct this discrepancy.Product Dimensions: 2.8 x 18.8 x 48.6 inches ; 7.9 pounds"
2,not what i expected,looked like it had been returned once. brackets are riveted and cannot be tightened. rod that holds step slips out of bracket.so far we set plants on steps but do not use it to stand on.i would try another brand if i could start over.
4,Just what I was looking for.,Well made and attractive. A bit heavy if it had to be moved far but very sturdy. Folds up very compactly for storage.
1,"Pretty on one side, HOWEVER.....","I bought this step ladder to go in my brand new $50,000 kitchen. It looked beautiful in the photos and the wood color mated my floors perfectly. HOWEVER, when it arrived and I took it out of the box, the entire, and I mean entire, underside is covered with stickers, labels, warnings, and in three languages to boot. The bad part is that when the ladder is set up and unfolded, the stickers on the underside are visible through the slats on the steps. It looks more like a step stool that should be in a garage than my new kitchen. I spent two hors pealing, applying Goof off and then staining the underside to make this ladder work.It is sturdy, but had I know the amount of work required to remove all those stickers, I would have not bought it.The manufacturers sure did try to cover all their legal bases on this small step stool."
2,Overall good product,"The ladder itself is well made and put together in a sold manner. The packing and shipping however is unsatisfactory. I ordered one ladder and had to return it due to damage because of inadequate packaging. While Amazon.com and the seller did a great job in immediately sending me a replacement, it too, also arrived damaged although to a much lesser degree. If the packaging of the product cannot better protect the ladder, I do not recommend buying this product online and would invest the time to find a local retailer that carries it."
2,Don't buy if you might want to return it,"This step stool was decent quality. I looks nice new, but the materials will clearly show early signs of wear and tear... that much I expected when I bought it. Unfortunately, the shape doesn't work for my purposes; I wanted a stool that would allow my toddler to wash his hands at the sink. The angle of the backside and upper handle keep him a few inches away from the counter and don't allow him to reach the water. So I wanted to return it.This product was sold and shipped from V&M; Innovations, not Amazon directly. V&M; Innovations charges as 25% restocking fee, and the return shipping for which I'm responsible is another 25% of the original purchase price. So, I would only get back half of what I paid. Are you kidding me? That's terrible."
2,Wrong Color!,"Received the stool today and it is just fine except for one crucial thing...it is as black as can be, not the mahogany/cherry color pictured and noted in all the reviews I read. So it will have to go back. I might try again to see if it was a one-time mistake as the stool is nice but what a pain."
4,"Solid, but need clearer instructions","Very well made and looks great. The issue with the closing is due to the labeling on the metal switch. It only says ""push to close"" when it really should say ""push IN to close"". The natural inclination is to push down. I bent the thing and almost snapped off the switch until I actually flipped the stool over to look at the mechanism. Other than this obvious fault, I think it's good product and would recommend it."
3,Good looking but very heavy,We recently remodeled our kitchen and the cabinets go to the ceiling. The kitchen dining area are one big room and can be seen from front door. The area we have to keep the ladder is not hidden so we wanted an attractive ladder which this is. The big drawback is that it is so heavy! I use it but as seldom as possible.
5,Great and attractive step stool,I am using this step stool in my bedroom closet in order to reach the top shelves. The step stool matches the flooring and is attractive looking as well a highly functional.
2,Big and Heavy,"This could be a great product for the right use. As a kitchen ladder it is just big, bulky and heavy. I chose the three step because I wanted to reach the top cabinets. Maybe the two step would have been better for that use. It is an nice looking product -- just didn't suit my needs."
4,Heavy but nifty,Quite a nice step ladder. It is rather heavy but looks and works well and feels very secure and stable.
2,Horrible support. They charge for updates when OS updates break their product,"I was very excited to get the Digi Mbox, as I needed a stable, high quality digital recording solution. And it worked great for the first few days, until I upgraded my Mac to Tiger, and their software stopped working. No problem I'll download an updater. BUT NO!! They CHARGE for this upgrade.The quality of the hardware is not impressive either, the mic preamps are noisy, you can't have a mic and stereo line inputs at the same time because they're both on the same jack (even though there is a front panel switch to select between the 2 inputs).I should have just bought the Maudio product."
2,They Burn Fast,"The Incense, Morning Star Pine; (50 Sticks) burn away lightning fast and don't have a lasting fragrance. They are quite short and very thin.The fragrance reminds me of New Mexico, USA restrooms in the 1960's. At that time, they built brand new roadside restrooms throughout the state and they all, I believe, used this automated spray. This incense reminds me of that smell and while it was a welcome addition to a roadside restroom (some were very nice, I might add), I think I'll pass on it for my home.I only drudged up 2 stars because I might be prejudice due to the restroom association experience."
3,Unusual Item,"This smells great, but they are not the usual incense sticks. These need a special holder. I made one with styrofoam, aluminum foil, and the little ceramic base they come with. It's not pretty, but it works."
5,Reason for Hope,This was one of her finest. Gave you insight into Jane herself and always a good story about the chimps. I would recommend it highly.
3,Hopeful ending,I enjoyed Jane's conversational style and the vivid descriptions of the scenic landscapes which highlighted important spiritual moments and exciting discoveries in her life. A nice parallel forms between the scientific and the spiritual when she begins to makes her revolutionary behavioral studies on chimps in Gombe. What should strike any reader is the opportunity that Jane was able to access through hard work and determination. Jane was without a college degree when she began her work with the chimps supported by Dr. Leaky. It was her character that mattered. The book can ramble or become tedious but Janes work is clearly so brilliant as is her knowledge of philosophy and evolution that it kept me pasted. She forms a positive outlook based on the hope that humans will evolve morally before they destroy themselves and countless other life forms.
2,a place for Jane to dump her old diary entries,"Boring and overly senamental.I couldn't even finish this book because I was so tired of reading exerpts from Jane Goodall's childhood journals. SOme of her poems were cute and amusing, but I couldn't help feeling that I was trapped into reading her old diaries...I can only compare it to being a cordial guest at someone's dinner party and being stuck looking at all their old photo albums...but...it is Jane Goodall and she has a good heart and message...if you can stand the sentimental quaintness of this book."
4,Hoping There's Hope,"Dr. Goodall, who is one of the giants of our age, writes a book which sounds a bit like she is trying to convince herself there is hope that chimpanzees, wildlife and life itself will survive.I work in the area of dolphin and whale intelligence and was surprised at her statement that mankind is the only animal who can describe objects which are not present. Experiments with dolphins certainly indicate they can do that.To me a stronger arguement that there is hope comes from the book ""The Long Boom"" which lays out a plausible scenario that the ongoing economic expansion, coupled with technology, will enable us to avoid the destruction of our planet - something which is imminent unless we take drastic action to avoid it.Dr. Goodall's final chapters are a challenging and moving exhortation to each of us to participate in this most exciting of challenges - to restore our planet to the condition in which God delivered it to us."
1,Yawn,"While I certainly cannot find fault with the content of this book --after all who can argue with Ms. Goodall's genuine desire for a better world for every living thing--I found the writing so tedious, dull, simplistic, and downright boring that I could hardly bear to keep plodding through. If it weren't for my book club choosing this, I would have quit mid-way. Ms. Goodall apparently has absolutely no sense of humor and takes herself way too seriously (even comparing herself to Saint Paul). Her beliefs are described in banal anecdotal lists (humans are cruel--Hitler, etc. but also good--Mother Theresa, etc.) with nothing new or intellectually stimulating to think about and no scientific evidence or research data provided to support her arguments. She just drones on and on! I couldn't wait to finish and get back to some good writing."
2,Bleah.,Not as good as I would have hoped. But it did have some interesting clips from various interviews.
4,Tough but necessary,"This is a difficult read. Sentences that span half a page or more, convoluted clauses and word after word that needs a glossary--all this makes the book an uphill climb which is, like so much in this life of loving God, of course always worth the while."
1,Could have been better.,It was not what we expected nor did we care for the music as much as other of his CDs. Those who enjoy Durante's early music will probably like it.
1,Terrible Quality,"First of all, we waited for awhile for this item to ship. Once we finally received it and opened the package, we were very disappointed. The plastic is rough with extremely sharp edges. We cannot use it for our fish aquarium at all for risk of injury. The item comes in several pieces and reminds me more of a cheap dollar store child's toy. Definitely not worth the 26 dollar price we paid, or the time we wasted waiting for it. We are now waiting for the seller to accept our request to have it returned."
2,Children's?,"Lots of high quality prints...but the compiler seems to have chosen some very dark and oppressive illustrations, including some by Kay Nielsen that are frankly pornographic. {Edit: since two commenters below have questioned that assessment, I'll describe one of the paintings that was particularly disturbing to me, especially in the context of a children's book--a nude monster god with a very sinister expression is reaching out to grasp a nude girl child. I don't know what others consider fit for children, but I decided to return the book.} The selection tends more towards the weirdly magical, dark, and even ugly, rather than the beautiful and innocent side of children's illustrators, in spite of the B. Potters and Howard Pyles. If that's your area of interest, this is the right book for you; I returned mine."
5,Small and efficient.,"This little mop bucket was exactly what I needed for a my small apt. Previously, I had hand wrung the mop (gross!) or had to use a large commercial bucket which just took up a ton of space in the utility closet. This is small, heavy duty, high quality and does the job."
4,Wonderful collection of Baroque music,Know who the best piano player of the 17th century was? I didn't until I read the liner notes in this collection. While all the music was written for harpsichord (since the piano wasn't invented until the 18th century) this album is a very entertaining introduction to a nice collection of Baroque masterpieces. Eminently listenable album.
1,The Dreaming,"I was deceived! After playing 25 seconds of each track I proceded to download the mp3's. However, when I played and burned the cd's then I realized that the vocal in EACH track started after approximately 25 seconds and was aweful. I basicly wanted a cd for my Yoga class. And I prefer instrumental with very little vocal. I was disappointed. I won't even play it at all."
1,Beware!,"Evidently there are at least two CDs with the same title ""Back to the 70s."" The one listed here with 16 original tracks was not the one I received. I recieved one with only 10 tracks, and only one title in common with those listed here (""One toke over the line"") Moreover, the CD I received was not of the original hits, but rather new recordings by the same artists. They sound just different enough to be annoying. Thankfully, Amazon has agreed to to refund my money."
4,Brewer and Shipley CD.,The last time I heard a song by Brewer and Shipley I owned a Sony 8-track recorder (yes it really worked). I taped this Brewer and Shipley LP for my girlfriend Ellen. She really loved this album.
5,Mini Shop Vac,"I bought this product to use as a secondary vacuum. I use it on my patio to clean up small messes in the garden, and around my cat's ltter box. The vacuum itself is very lightweight and powerfull. I am very pleased with this purchase."
2,not for what I needed it for,"I wanted a small, powerful vac that would be used solely for cleaning my rabbit cage.....shavings and hay clean-up mostly.... so I wouldn't wear out our house vacuum. This clogged minutes after I started using it. I am going to return it tomorrow, clog and all back to the store I bought it from. I will agree with a previous reviewer that the point where the hose connects to the canister is a significant defect as it makes it difficult for larger items to enter. However, if you are looking for a mini-vac for small jobs, like cleaning your car, I can see where this may come in handy."
3,Shop vac small but mighty,I use it to clean around the fireplace hearth and in my car. Make sure there are no hot embers and it will do the trick.
2,Could be a lot better.,"The suction on this little shop vac is not very strong, even when it's running properly. Worse, the one big flaw in this vac is that it tips over easily if you happen to set it on the floor. Once it has tipped over, the suction ceases entirely, and the only thing that works to get it going again is to turn it off, take off the top, and put the top back on, again. Very, very inconvenient. Surely there has got to be a small, portable shop vac that works better than this one. If it were only more stable when you set it down, it would not be such a problem because it would not be tipping over all the time. I would not purchase this vac again."
2,not happy,"The shop vac was way over priced and didn't realize it until I received it. . I order it during the Christmas rushAlso I received two orders of 3 vacs. After explaining to ""Unbeatable sales"" I only ordered 3 vacs not 6 they didn't credit my account the proper amount of $162.00They credited me $130. I also paid 19.00 to ship it back to them.They would not prepay the shipping.Not happy."
4,pretty good but some problems,"Mine is about a year old and I think there has been a re-design because some features have changed. Some of this may not be apllicable to the new one.on the pluse side-tiny, this thing is super puny and a breeze to cart around-good suction esp. for it's size.-not to loud, not >super< quiet, but not bad at all.-very easy to cart aroundI am a contractor and use this for small jobs inside peoples homes, it fits right in the top of my 5 gallon tool bucket.-did I mention it is tiny, so much less hassle then lugging out the big shop vacThe Badthe clips to hold bottom to top are not all that great and come apartthe hose attaches in an odd and inconvinient way, and mine came off sometimes until I glued itthe filter is a bit of a pain to clean"
3,A powerful little pain in the...,"It's sure powerful allright, but it's almost impossible for me to empty this thing without making a mess. The dirt is all over the place in the vacuum canister itself, and then there are the filters that must be changed.I suppose it would be great if you have a specialized need to vacuum a small amout of ""wet"" occassionally, but if you are mainly doing your car or just quick clean-up of dry stuff, consider one of the new higher powered ""dustbuster"" designes.In all fairness, at least with this little guy you don't have a battery that stops holding a charge after a few months of use. However, I'm looking to replace both this little annoyance and my can't-hold-a-charge dustbuster with a new design of corded hand vac."
4,"Great power, but chintzy","I paid $19 for this at my local Target. It has amazing suction for a tiny machine, and the basic tools are more than enough for me. I bought it to vacuum out my car (excellent for this)and for the ocassional spills on my rugs.The reasons why this is not 5 stars:1) cheap plastic.2) short cord.3) A little tricky to empty when used for dry pick-ups.While I like it and the price was right, Sears had a more powerful on sale a week or so later. It looked better made too.If you can get this for $19, buy it. If you have to do heavy wet/dry vacuuming, buy a bigger and more powerful model."
4,Great for cleaning rug spots with water,"I've owned on of these for over a year, and am going to buy one for my daughter. I use this vac for only one purpose: cleaning up spills and dog mistakes on our persian carpets. We have an old dachshund so there is a mistake about once a week. No problem to clean up. I take a gallon of cold water, table spoon of white vinegar and sponge in into the spot, 3 or 4 sponges worth, sucking in back out with the shop vac. I then follow up with a clear water rinse and vacuum it all out again. Good as new - the spots are gone without any stain. There are much better vacuums for dirt, this one is very handy for these wet situations."
5,Just what I needed,I received the vac just when I expected it. And it is better than I had hoped it would be. I'm a small 5 foot 2 inch woman and would have my husband vacuum the stairs for me. It's back-breaking work! But now I can do it in my own time. and I can get the corners and edges of our home cleaner than they have been in years. Thank heaven for this product! I'm very happy with it!
3,"Misleading ""sub item"" offer.","Pleased with vacuum itself. HOWEVER, the sub item bundle offer below the full description of vacuum was very misleading. More or less indicated that the 906-68 All Around Collection Bag (3 pack) was compatible with this vacuum - this is not the case as the package specifically says for model QAM70 only - and that's not the model number of the mini hangup vacuum. I ordered the filters thinking they were compatible and now have no use for them. This item should be removed from the bundle offered as a sub-item - I checked with Shop-Vac Corp. and the hangup model vac does not use filters."
4,Great Little Sucker,"I love this little tool! Because I'm a fulltime RVer, I don't have room for a full-size shop vac, but often need the power of one to clean out the truck and trailer. This mighty mini does the trick. Some have complained that it is difficult to clean, but I didn't find it any more tough to clean than any other shop vac. My only real complaint is that it is so small, it has a tendancy to tip when I'm using it."
1,Boooooooooo!,"Space is an issue for me. So is cleanliness. Why does this vac stink? Because the motor is less than an inch from the walls of the dirt canister. If you've used a shop vac & know how dirt packs to the filter, you may as well empty it on your floor & vac it all back up again. Putting the entire vac in the trash receptacle, then removing the top is the cleanest you can get with this. The hose doesn't unscrew; it slides between the top & bottom.The side tabs that lock are very tight; so tight that one snapped off, so I couldn't send it back. If you want a REALLY good small shop vac, go with the All Around. It may *seem* expensive, but when you get this vac, you'll kick yourself. A dustbuster would be better/easier.Sorry ShopVac- you failed with this pain in the butt."
1,Not a small shop vac,"Don't let the name fool you, this is not a miniature version of the larger shop vacs. Yes, it is powerful, but it creates more of a mess emptying it than I've ever used it to clean up. The entrance of the hose on the inside is also about 1/2 inch from the filter, try cleaning up anything longer than 1/2 and it clogs.... I was trying to use it to suction up the little bit of hay that escapes from my rabbits cage and it is perfectly useless for this. The attachment on my regular vacuum works much better. If it hadn't been a gift, I'd have returned it after the first use. As it is, its sitting unused in my closet."
1,Junk,"I owned one of these for about a week. The tank falls off easily, as will all Shop Vac products; the hose has to be glued on, and all the plastic cheapness is not worth the decent motor and suction. Filters cost a fortune for this tiny nothing."
4,Alexander on Cultural Studies,"Jeffrey Alexander of Yale, a student of Talcott Parsons and deep reader of an unusual proportion of social theory, gives us here a set of essays on cultural sociology meant to better define the field as a modern sociological program. As another reviewer noted, this is not a facile book, but perfectly accessible to any person with some acquaintance with political or social theory. To my mind, the best essay in the book is the last - ""Modern, Anti, Post, and Neo: How Intellectuals Explain 'Our Time.'"" This is very useful making sense of ""post-modernism,"" locating it among the significant theoretical tendencies of the past quarter century. In this, it functions rather like Berlin's ""The Counter-Enlightenment,"" which also gave an overview of a very complex set of intellectual movements, those of the first half of the 19th Century."
4,Another nice one from UNITED CUTLERY,"This is the medium sized Bowie that comes with a fairly nice leather sheath with 'old west'type fringe. This and the larger 15 inch are an excellent buy for the price and are well made and nicely finished. Would be a nice knife for the Mountain Man in your family. I was surprised with the leather quality as well and if you dont like the fringe, thats not a problem to remove. Sturdy build. This is a serious knife for the collector or hunter/camper. Don't let the price fool you on this one."
5,Excellent book on Western Horsemanship,"This is a must read for trainers in any Western discipline. Bob has written a book on how to make a well-broke horse; one that can go in any direction. The information is organized and specific, from evaluating a performance prospect, riding a 2, then 3 year old and on to competition. A great book for anyone looking to lay down a solid foundation for any horse."
4,Great racing fun,It is really a good game to get everyone involved as up to four players can race simultaneously.
2,ripoff of mario kart,This game is a ripoff of the mario kart series. This game has items that you throw at your opponenents. mario kart has better items you throw at your opponents. this game has sharp turns mario kart has better sharp turns that you do not go flying everywhere. Like in this game.this game has lacky controls (for the ps2 verision)
3,Great gameplay but lack of length,"It's got great gameplay, it's easy to control and it isn't as babyish as MArio Kart Double Dash but it losses out on points because it's so short and there is a lack of character {all the bosses should be unlockable}.I personally prefered the playstation 'Crash Team Racing'.Gameplay : 4/5Graphics : 4/5Decency {how cool or sad the plot and characters are} : 3/10Game length: 1.5/5"
2,Don't Go Near this game!,"No matter how cool this game looks like, don't ever buy it. When I first looked at it, I first thought it would be like the classic,fun Crash Team Racing, little did I know I would be ripped off. The gameplay is boring, the controls are unresponsive, and there are not as many tracks.The sound is BAD. The characters repeat the same taunts over and over again.(especialy Coco)To sum it up,(you'd get bored to death if I told you everything I hate.)if you are a huge Crash fan, and you love kart racing, get Crash Team Racing(PS). If you're still a Crash fan, but you don't really like kart racing, get Crash Tag Team Racing(PS2). And if you don't like Crash, but like kart racing, get Mario Kart Double Dash!!(GC)Like I said, don't go near this game!"
2,Avoid Vivendi Universal games,"This is the second game we've bought that Vivendi Universal has taken over from the original creators and they've ruined this one, too. First, they brought down Spyro, and now they're after Crash Team Racing. The cars aren't easily controlled, the graphics got blurry going around some of the corners making it hard to tell where you were on the course, and worst of all - as soon as the first place racer crosses the finish line, the race is over. Whatever place you're in when they cross, that's where you end up. It was so much better when everyone was allowed to finish. I paid full price for this game so I'll muddle through it, but I'm never buying one of their games again."
5,Crash Nitro Kart is a Hit,"We first tried CTR for playstation and loved it. Then we found Crash Nitro Kart and really thought it kicked butt. Anybody that doesn't think that it's equally as good, if not better then the orginal CTR, is looking way to deep into the game. It's a fun, competitive racing game with great graphics, creative power-ups and cool characters. I would totally suggest owning all of the Bandicott racing games."
2,not for me....,i really didn't like the game.. i thought it was going to be more like a crash badicoot level game .. instead it was racing a go kart i guess i didn't think about that when i read the title. oops my fault.
4,Crash Nitro Kart,"If you like Crash Team Racing, you'll like Crash Nitro Kart.You can race as Crash Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, Crunch Bandicoot, Dr. Neo Cortex, N. Gin, Tiny, N.Oxide, & N. Trance. You can unlock Dingodile, Polar, Pura, Zem, Zam, N. Tropy, & Velo.There are thirteen races & five arenas. They're similar to Crash Team Racing, but the graphics are better.This is a great game."
5,A skillful weaving of romantic suspense and reincarnation,"Ms. Snodgrass pulls the reader into her story from page one. Dr. Alec Edwards and Dani Morgan meet by accident -- or was it? It seems that they have been lovers in the past, but something has always happened to keep them apart. Will they succeed this time?The story is highly enjoyable and a good read. The author skillfully interweaves the reincarnation aspects with romantic suspense elements. There is more than enough suspense, danger and romance to keep any reader interested until the very end."
4,Quick read for insight into the life of a great man,"Brown is one of my heroes in Mormonism - a deep thinker, not afraid to challenge tradition, and tolerate of those who are different. This collection of memoires is short, but sweet. Anyone who's a Mormon Democrat, liberal, square peg in a church of round holes, or outside-of-the-box type will find his perspectives refreshing. The final anachronistic sections in this collection are full of statements and assertions of compassion and open-mindedness that are gems."
3,RRSO???,"I've even got this set in hand yet nowhere on any of the jackets or packaging does it hint to or indicate the slightest clue as to who or what the RRSO stands for. Even Google doesn't lead to any clue about it. As for the music it seems ok, a bit schmaltzy I guess, but a nice but not a chilling wow at all like you might get with something Percy Faith could have done with it, I've just not had enough time to listen long enough to any of it yet really."
5,A superb introduction to Messiaen's music.,"The importance of Messiaen's music is nowhere more exemplified than in the recordings by his student and champion, Pierre Boulez. Written for the victims of fascism and war, 'Et Exspecto Ressurectionem Mortuorum' is a profound essay on the struggles and horrors of war. His total non-use of counterpoint and fiercely dramatic dynamic and ensemble contrasts are analogous to the struggle and anemia of war. And Boulez, with his exacting clarity and flair for making accessible the most seemingly inaccessible music, is the perfect guide for this draining, cathartic work. With Messiaen himself supervising the recording, this recording will appeal to Messiaen-lovers and modern-music-shy listeners alike."
2,Temporary spinner,"I would agree for the most part with the above reviews. However, i'm not sure how much wire ( Romex) everyone is using on this. This spinner lasted about 4 weeks for my crew wiring apartments. I would say 20,000' feet is when this spinner breaks down and you find yourself back at building your own out of 2x4's. But hey, for 50.00 and limited use, I could see it lasting for years. For extended use, the foldable stud mounted spinners are far superior. Easier to move through stud bays to other rooms. This model wont break down small enough to fit through a standard stud bay."
5,Great for the price!,"This is a great inexpensive tablecloth, very easy to maintain and it looks very pretty on the table. As previous reviewer stated, 90-inch rounds are very hard to find. While this isn't going to look extremely high-end like a fine linen or silk cloth (something about a cloth with a sheen looks like poly no-iron no matter how pretty), it does look very nice and is a dream to take care of! I got napkins to go with and I have received many compliments. I will buy another in a different color because it works so well."
5,Elegant & Simple,"This is a very nice and elegant table cover. It is true to its Gold color, but not too gold or too dark. It is a great buy and much less expensive than what [...] or their store sells for."
1,Not terribly helpful.,"""Be more extroverted"" is essentially the theme of this text. It's essentially a list of things Introverts are supposed to excel at. In all honesty, speaking to another person provided better results."
3,Good Information,"There is some great information here, though the book as a whole is at times repetitive. Explanations of some of the finer points in neurobiology seemed a little too compressed and vague. Overall, I'm glad that I purchased the book and read it cover to cover. I learned a lot about myself and others"
4,Very informative and helpful,"Being 100% introverted myself, I really appreciated this book. (Just how introverted am I? She has a list of 30 common characteristics, and I fit every single one of them.)It's encouraging and shed a lot of light on several areas of my somewhat gloomy existence. The author goes into detail about all the common personality quirks of introverts and provides possible solutions for surviving the breakneck pace of...well, this extroverted world we live in.Only things I didn't like were a tendency to repeat a lot of information. Repetition makes it easier to remember, but after the fourth or fifth time, it just gets a bit annoying. Also thought she could have chosen better words in some cases. But then, I'm a writer, so I'm always nitpicky about that. All in all, it's a great book for any introvert who feels like they just can't fit in."
5,An Ah-ha! Moment kind of Book,This book helps both introverts and extroverts understand why introverts act the way they do and discover the strengths within their nature. This book is a great read for anyone struggling to understand themselves as an introvert or for an extrovert who struggles in their relationship with an introvert.
3,Good News for Introverts!,"I have good news for all introverts out there. There's nothing wrong with being quiet and reserved. If there were no introverts there would be few writers! There's now scientific and psychological evidence that being an introvert has advantages. Marti Olsen Laney in, The Introvert Advantage, gives valuable tips to help introverts not just get by, but actually flourish in our extroverted world. Enjoy the book. Introverts love to read. I know because I'm an introvert."
3,Betrays introverts? No.,"I give this book three stars for (1) reading too much like a college paper and (2) being biased toward certain types of introverts.That said, the reviews that say that this book betrays the introvert by, consciously or unconsciously, encouraging us to adapt to the extrovert world, are wrong. There's no betrayal here. We introverts should not hide in holes and dig them deeper as life goes on. No, we don't always want to be drawn out, but a little perspective is healthy sometimes. You CAN overdo your introvertedness if you refuse to experiment with the extroverts' world every now and then. You should always try to enjoy some aspect of the opposite of your ways. It's fresh sometimes."
1,The Kindle edition is a mess,"I'm sure the content of this book is excellent, judging by the other comments, but the Kindle version is a terrible experience - so much that I'm unsure I can finish the book. Missing punctuation, extra or missing spacing, chapter headings at the foot of a prior page - I'm constantly jolted out of the book by the sloppy presentation. And unfortunately it reflects on the author by making their words look amateurish. Do not buy the Kindle version,"
2,Betrays its audience,"Laney's book is a perfect example of the marketing aspect of psychiatry. The phrase ""introvert advantage"" appears perhaps once in her entire book, and despite what you would think, the idea that introversion is an advantage doesn't play a central role in her theory. ""The introvert advantage"" is a phrase that sounds good and gets hopeful people to buy the book, but in the end, Laney's message is that being introverted and being successful (""success"" being defined by the psychological industry) don't make for a realistic combination. The author says the traits of introversion do have their advantages (introspection, for one) and no one should feel bad about being introverted, but the final chapter of her book is entitled ""Extroverting,"" which says it all. In the end, the assumption is that what introverts really want and need is to be more extroverted. In the end, the book betrays its audience."
3,"It's alright, but dissapointing","I randomly picked this book up the other day, not knowing what to expect. I started reading it and was instantly sucked in. It was amazing how well she described myself as introverted, and it was fascinating how she explained how an introverted brain works. And this was only the first couple of chapters!Unfortunately, it goes downhill from there. After a good start is reverts to standard self-help fluff, and like others have said, becomes a little too cute. Worst of all, it suffers from the very problem its trying to address. The book never says just what the advantage of being an introvert is, but instead says repeatedly how I have low energy and get overwhelmed easily. The book treats introversion as a disease, and how to cope.Not that the book is completely worthless. The beginning is quite good, and there are some good tips and ideas throughout. I'm sure there are worse books out there, but there are probably much better ones too."
2,There MUST be Better Books on this Topic,"This book was mediocre, as to the contents about living life as an introvert. For one, the title is totally misleading in that she never describes how to thrive in an extrovert world, nor addresses why we really should be concerned with that. If you want a book with a few interesting tidbits as to introversion, this is your book. But why pay for the book, given the little you gain? Just check it out from the library. Overall is is a terrible discussion of the topic and misnamed."
1,Would not recommend,"I'm roughly 1/4 of the way finished with this book, and I can't help but notice the huge amount of obvious grammatical errors and poor reasoning. I really don't intend to be rude, but I feel like this has the writing level of a college freshman. Bear in mind, these aren't subtle errors--they are missing periods, huge amount of run on sentences, vague references, etc.. Also, there seems to be no scientific background for any of the claims made so far; most of the claims have been based on actors in movies or references to pop culture. I'm going to read up to half of the book, and if this poor quality writing continues, I'm just going to stop. If you're looking for a scientific approach (or at least slightly scientific) to this topic, this book is certainly not the best answer."
2,Not as Helpful as I Hoped It Would Be,This was recommended to me by my therapist. Don't get your hopes up if you think this book will solve your problems. I really only found 2 or 3 out of the 14 or so chapters helpful.
5,NOW I understand!,"I read the first paragraph of this book, and tears welled up in my eyes.NOW I understand! I am not crazy, or off, or something wrong with me- I'm just an introvert.In a hugely extroverted world, trying to live the first 50 years of my life trying to please everyone, and always feeling over whelmed and tired, I am now at peace!Trying to explain this to my extroverted family has been a challenge, but now I can say NO thanks, and not feel guilty or like I""m letting down others.This is how I""m made, and I need to take care of me.SO what if I enjoy being alone most of the time, and don't enjoy barbeques, family reunions, concerts, crowded church services, or even more than ten people!It's me, and it's OK!GREAT book, easy to read and very very helpful"
4,So that's what it's called....,"I am a self-proclaimed introvert. Only recently, with the help of this book, I've learned what that really means. The Introvert Advantage offers insight into intoversion, but, like other reviewers mentioned, the book doesn't tell me how to thrive, like the title implies. I wasn't disappointed, though. I was interested in what it means to be introverted, not so much in thriving in an extrovert world. Very pleased with the purchase, but be aware of what you're getting or you'll regret buying it. :)"
1,where's the advantage?,"Not a great book, and the title and intro are misleading. The book is extremely repetitive, and could have been trimmed down to about half it's present length without losing any content. The major point of the book is that if you are an introvert and you want to succeed, you should become more extroverted. Did I really need to read this book to figure that out?"
2,Made Introverts Look Weak,"As an introvert, I picked up this book hoping it would provide me with insight as to why I felt out of place in the world. Instead I got a sense that I was weaker, less confident and fearful of the ""extroverted"" world. I realize the book has to be general to reach more people, but even after taking the quiz and scoring in the ""very introverted"" range, I couldn't help thinking that I should be more fearful and less confident than I feel! I agree with the internal processing and neurochemistry information, but I can't accept some of the stereotypical personality traits the author presents of intorverts and extroverts."
2,An Alien's Guide to Acting Human?,"I think the first half of the book was great with lots of interesting information. I have no idea, however, what was hypothesis vs. proven fact. In the E-book version, there are some technical issues. While this is not untypical of works that have just been scanned and converted to the proper formats, I still think editors should go over this. Although, I think ""human beans"" sound absolutely delicious.The latter half was disparaging for me. According to the Myers-Briggs test, I am an INTJ. And while this is fairly accurate to my personality, the book seemed to lose the plot. Even as a highly introverted person, a lot of this is just common sense. But I found the coping advice bizarre. I don't think an extrovert reading such things would get an accurate picture of an Introvert. While we are confusing to socially interact with, we aren't alien life forms who're puzzled by social gestures, body language, and small talk; it's just annoying."
4,Good book,I read the book and it has some really good points about being an introvert. The only complaint I have is the continual injection of scientific studies about brain chemistry and the naming of chemicals. I did not need a detailed biological or chemistry understanding of introverts but rather wanted just the outer descriptions.
4,Worth it,I picked this book up in the store and as soon as I opened it I knew I had to read it. It has the kind of information that leads you to insights you wish you had made long ago.Read this if people complain you live in your head too much. you'll finally be able to answer them.
3,Diane Sawyer is an introvert!,I think that was when she lost me. I could not care less about Sawyer or any other celebrity for that matter. The book starts out fine but it never really delivers on the promise of the title. I never could quite discern from it what the advantages were. What I got from it is that introverts are sad isolated people who really don't contribute all that much. I would not recommend this book.
2,Literally Unreadable,"The book is printed in blue ink, making it unpleasant to read. I don't mean just headlines or sidebars are blue, but the entire text. From the little I was able read before my eyeballs went on strike, it seems like facile psychobabble. Get _Party of One_ by Anneli Rufus, a wonderful manifesto of lonerdom, instead."
1,rehash rehash rehash!,"i saw this book at a book store and picked it up after reading the intro. great intro, btw. i bought it on amazon later, and when it arrived i started reading it.why does she repeat herself OVER and OVER again?it's very annoying! she introduces an idea and just when you think she's done, she's saying the same thing AGAIN. the actual amount of content in the book isn't all that great. it only has the number of pages that it has because of its repetitive nature. the book should fit in half the number of pages that it has.also, the book feels like a good college research paper. she's done research and managed to pull together some info and slapped it into a book. there doesn't really seem to be much original idea in it.it's horrible."
2,"A fun & quick read, but too simplified and generalized.","The science and the biology part of the book was the best in this book. Other than those couple chapters, it felt like the author was generalizing too much.The author looks into the right brain and left brain of introverts, but there are more temperaments than these two. The Myers-Briggs test has 4 axes, which covers the human nature in a broader scale. The author focuses only on the Introversion/extroversion and left/right brain, which is the I,E and the F/T part of the Myers-Briggs. Focusing on only these two properties without any other possibly important properties and generalizing is the biggest weakness of this book."
5,Excellent resource,"Purchased on recommendation of a medical professional, and very glad to have been directed to it. Our introvert loved it, appreciated it, and found it very easy to relate to the author's content."
4,Helpful resource,A helpful resource for introverts and extroverts. This book helps you understand how you work (assuming you're an introvert) and how to work with a world that is mostly extroverted. Many laughs and 'a-hah!' moments occurred while reading the book. It was an easy to read book that is definitely a must read for anyone who has an introvert who is close to them or is an introvert themselves. The only downfall of the book is that it got 'wordy' at points and a more direct approach to the information could have been given.
3,"Juvenile, but sweet","If you are looking for something substantial to read, this isn't for you. Los ojos de mi princesa is poetic and well written (in spanish), but it is for young Adults....unless you just feel like reading something enchantingly cheesy"
1,Pesimo,"Es una perdida de tiempo la lectura de este libro, no lo recomiendo para nada, el argumento es malo y la historia muy floja."
2,Alec Baldwin does not improve this movie,"Suspension of belief improved viewing & Alec Baldwin ""overplayed"" his character. Think I let the cover ""take me in"" on this one."
2,Thumbs down on this one.,"I read that this was such a terrific show. One of Alec Balwins' best achievements. I was excited when it came, because I thought it was going to be really good. It was really boring. And the actors that were in the movie, being top of the line names in movies & television went through the movie like they were sleep-walking. Poor performances on all their parts. I was very disappointed."
3,Not Quite What I Remembered,I bought the DVD to replace an old VHS tape that had been on the shelf for years. The level of intrigue was quite ordinary twenty years later.
2,Not a very robust story,"I know that this a kid's book - and I am not a kid! I read this book along with a few others to try to get more information and insight on the Amish life-style.But that being said, I think even a 12 year old might find it lacking in a good flow or deep insights. The story could have been a good one, but the writing was just not that compelling. You didn't really get interested in the characters; they weren't very personalized."
2,"Stylish, but not durable","I loved how this clock looked mounted on my wall, and it received many compliments. Within six months, the pendulum mechanism stopped working. Also, the clock hands are incredibly thin and bend easily when being cleaned, causing the clock to hang up on itself.I really wish I could rate it better, and I really REALLY wish the pendulum still worked."
2,It's good considering the price...,"For the price of $14.99 combined with other things to get free shipping, it's a good deal. If you want the red of Spiderman to look red vs. orange, you won't be happy - hence the warning about the colors not being the same. The graphics on the bottom of the board are defective and it's peeling straight out of the box. Since this was bought as a gift, I'm not taking it away from a child since they're happy with it. It's good for a beginner, but the grip and graphics will need changing pretty fast - so if you're buying it for a cheap board, great - if you're buying it because it's Spiderman... it's more like a peeling Pumpkinman."
4,Hours of Fun,"I purchased for my 6 year old grandson and he has had hours of fun, and what boy that age doesn't like Spiderman. It's a great beginner's board."
3,"on time delivery, an ok product","The skateboards arrived on time and in good shape.The wheels on one of them were not mounted 100% perpendicular to the board, so to go straight one has to lean over a little.For the money it was a good buy. Great for beginners."
5,They still make'm like the OLD DAYS,I'm so sick of the flimsy plastic mop buckets that break when you use the mop wringer.I looked forever trying to find a REAL mop bucket made of STEEL! This is the only company still making REAL mop buckets.If you are tired of wasting time and money on all of the plastic junk then spend a few dollars more and buy the real thing! They are made in AMERICA and they last a lifetime!The cost is only 10 to 20% more than a similar plastic model that will be broke in 3 months.
1,Not for Newbies,"I love the picture, but there is no guidance outline on grid and yarn colors are too similar in colors (i.e., tan/flesh/light taupe/oatmeal). The yarn colors should be separated into each of their respective categories and their wrappers should be titled according to its color classification. Maybe okay for a pro with good eyes and has the time (and patience) to count lines in the grid as to where to start and to hold the yarn up to sunlight to try and figure out what color resembles. Would not recommend - too time consuming and frustrating."
1,So it's come to this...,"Do not be fooled by the words ""Fallout"" and ""50's sci-fi"", they have absolutely nothing to do with this game. ""Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel"" is pretty much gratuitous naked skin, wrapped in an otherwise fine franchise.Even by today's console standards, this game falls short in many categories. The graphics are sub-par, the gameplay is bland at best, and you'll need a microscope the magnitude of a truck, to even spot the slightest hint of ""atmosphere"" in this mood-ridden hunk o' junk.For shame!"
1,Non Canon,"The makers of this game should have either NOT named this Fallout OR added a disclaimer that this game is NOT apart of the Fallout CanonThis game should be considered a lame 'ode' to Fallout rather than an actual FO game.Gameplay sucks, graphics suck, over-use of foul language and lame inappropriate jokes ((all the time, left and right))Instead of Nuka-Cola, Bawls soda appears in the game ***huge annoying distraction outside of the FO canon; and many weapons are named for modern guns (example: ""Desert Eagle"")Unless (you can get this game cheap and) your an avid Fallout fan curious as to what the fuss was all about (Canon/non-canon) DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY*The makers of THIS game should be exiled to Antarctica!"
3,Okay but not that good!,"Fallout BOS is boring as hell camera angle is hard to get around to, the original music is good,but the added music from crappy fake metal bands sucks! it ruins the games compared to the other fallout games the rest fallout games rocks but this on is the least of my likings out the series!"
2,Disappointing,"Graphics were bland compared to other similar titles, profanity was too extreme, auto-targeting didn't really seem functional.Yawwwn.Don't waste your money. Better games out for less cash."
1,Horrible,"Wow. There's not really any words to describe this game. I got it thinking it would be cool since I love the post-apocalyptic genre, but the game turned out to be really bad. The plot was ridiculous, and all the quests were boring, repetitive things like ""find the key and bring it back to me"".The fighting was probably the worst part of the game, which is pathetic, since the fighting plays the biggest role in the game. You just run around with your fingers mashing the auto-aim button and the fire button. There's no strategy or skill involved, it was just boring. The graphics suck also, compared to most X-Box games.This game is a disgrace, do yourself a favor and don't rent or buy it."
4,great game,Great game. Didnt expect it to be as fun. Easy controlling. Would like to generate own character than pre selected.
4,"This should NOT be a Fallout game, but it is fun.","Whatever your thoughts about this game, it is NOT a Fallout game. A Fallout game would have a vast story, completely customizable characters, and an open-ended world.Despite all this, the game is a lot of fun, even though it is kind of a treadmill. They game is reminiscent of a wasteland version of Diablo II, what with the myriad weapons and leveling system that they have set up.So, all in all, fun, but it should not be lumped in with Fallout."
5,Great Co-op game,"Had some friends over, and everyone enjoyed this game. Great game to play with a friend, still fun by yourself.Had one friend that refused to play it because it was different then the PC versions. He stayed home by himself. :) I bet he'd like it if he gave it a chance."
4,Valedictory,The composer has the joy of working with Kristian Zimerman and it shows... the cover doesn't lie. Zimerman makes sense out of Lutoslawskis's music like no other concerto dedicatee. (sorry Mstislav)
2,the Golden Cup,"I'm not a big fan of Marcia willett's books I guess. I read the Birdcage, and it was alright, although predictable. I was reading the Golden Cup, and decided I just didn't care what happened to Honor/Mutt, or Emma/Mousie...or whatever....Right now I'm reading Sarah Challis' Blackthorn Winter and find this more enjoyable."
2,"Not your typical MacLean story, unfortunately.","Having read Night Without End, Ice Station Zebra and Bear Island, Alistair MacLean seems to have tried something new with Seawitch. Unfortunately it doesn't work out. This book breaks from his usual mystery/action/drama formula. There is no ""traitor amongst them"" story, no mystery and dull action. The characters have no depth. Two fired cops, a billionaire with his two daugthers and a disgruntled oil well fire-fighter. This doesn't make for a gripping story. It looks like Alistair MacLean had a bill due so he churned out this snoozer in a week's time. I really like Alistair MacLean (so far), but Seawitch lacks in so many ways."
2,Sadly outdated,"I remember having read this novel once as a teenager, so recently I thought I'd reread it.Suffice it to say, I've aged far better than this story has. The characters' sexist, racist attitudes and the dialog between the male and female characters range from the trite and somewhat silly to the off-putting and absurd; virtually all of the characters (especially the women) are stereotyped and two-dimensional. As an example of 1970s pulp, I suppose it could be considered a pretty typical example, and if read in the proper historical context (think 70s James Bond movies) one may get some entertainment value from it. It is not one of MacLean's better novels, though."
5,A POWERERFUL ANTHOLOGY OF SOME OF THE WORLD'S BEST POEMS!,"I read from this collection of poems on a regular basis. Insightful editing, wonderful translations, and meaningful introductions are what set this book apart from other collections. I strongly recommend this book to all who have a love of poetry and seek a deeper connection with themselves and the world around them."
4,Falls Apart,The boxed fireworks doesn't work perfectly but the Chinese figure looks very realistic. There are a few parts on it where it falls apart. Other than that nice toy.
2,"Tinny, hollow sound",I am pretty unhappy with the performance of this product - my formerly powerful system now sounds tinny and flat. The band cut-offs don't seem to be the same as what they are labeled as either. Only install this if you're a fan of anemic midrange.
1,Very deficient the servicios,"After one month it(he,she) is that I could obtain the product since it was sent without information of the buyer and the same one"
2,Hint of promise peeks from beneath recycled exterior,"The description of characters and events is good at times, and the book is readable, but Nasir recycles the brainiac computer nerd, the foreign mystic/scientist, the does-it-all housewife/realtor, the ex-con trying to go straight (with limited success), the dead hero who promised to return (a la King Arthur), the scummy lawyer, the hard-boiled FBI agent, and a government conspiracy. The book is an interesting blend of science and fantasy, but the author needs some fresher ideas."
5,Best Map we bought,"We just moved here to the U.S. and sometimes we where really ""LOST"" over here. But not any more. This Map is Great!!!Big and clear pages und you can find any street you looking for."
3,the cover art is far better than what's inside,"i judged a book by it's cover. the words ""historical romp"" and ""there is weirdness everywhere...rocket science is your ticket to a glimpse of it"" from the reviews on the cover clinched it. i bought it. i read it. i wanted to like it. heck, i wanted to love it. instead i was singularly unimpressed and disappointed. if this book had been written and come out in the late forties (the time it is set in), it probably would have been a barn-burner. instead it's just flat and uninteresting. characters aren't fleshed out, everyone turns out to be nazis or reds or mafia or yadda yadda yadda. not close to believable and not fun on top of it. the actual interaction with the alien craft, the ONLY interesting bit, comes way too late in the story and also needed to be fleshed out more. it's set up for a sequel which would have been great if it had been as fun and romp-ish as it's cover implied. don't waste your time with this one or the next..."
4,"An amusing pulp-revival story, and a good first novel","____________________________________________This is an amusing pulp-revival story, set just after WW2. A returning American soldier steals a Nazi superplane that turns out to be a damaged alien spacecraft. Hijinks ensue.A pretty good first novel, but slight: ""B"", for me anyway. Others have liked it more: http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue433/books.html[Lake has captured] ""the thrill-a-minute plotting of the pulps, and a Heinleinian transparency of prose.

1,Terrible Play Yard,"I didn't care that the play yard is ugly. I just needed it to be functional. However, while putting it up, one of the corner ""joints"" shattered. It was so frustrating! We ended up sending back the piece of garbage, and we bought a beautiful bronze metal play yard. Sure, this yard is much, much cheaper. However, it didn't save us any money, because it turned out to be so fragile that it was useless for our purpose."
4,Great way to get dinner done!,"Provides secure area for my toddler to play while I'm getting dinner ready. It is easy to assemble, one you get past the idea that unfolding it ""forceably"" isn't going to break it."
4,Good but wish there was a way to attach to wall,"We were looking for a fence for our patio. We bought this fence after looking at others. It is good, we leave it out at night. However, I wish there was a way to attach this to the wall."
2,Great at keeping a bunch of stuffed animals safe...,"My daughter can knock this right over. Needs to be made stronger, I wouldnt trust it to keep an infant or toddler from getting out. I also have another play yard made of metal that is much sturdier, made from Regalo, (4 in 1 metal play yard) but North States also makes one that looks the same."
4,Peace of Mind,"The play yard was a great purchase. It is sturdy, safe, and best of all allows me to leave the room without worry. I put all of my son's toys inside it, and it is like Disney World for him - he loves it! Now, he has started to pull up on it and stand, and never once have I worried that it will collapse. I think it is helping him to walk much sooner - yikes!"
3,Effective,"My husband and I bought this product for our 9 month old daughter. We use it more as a gate rather than a pin. The product is effective in keeping my daughter within an area but not easy to use. The gate is difficult to bend at the corners, hard to open/close, and a little flimsy...if my daughter leans on it too hard, it buckles."
4,Great floating gate,We originally bought this gate to protect our Christmas tree from our little one... but ended up using it as a floating gate around our entertainment center- we love it! Everyone that comes over thinks its such a clever gate to use to keep the kiddos from constantly turning on and off the tv....
4,Best play space!,"This is great. We have it for our 7 month old son who was crawling all over the place. He loves to hang out in here and play. He doesn't hurt himself and if you add a foam playmat under it, it's even safer.It's nice to have insetead of a playard because you can sit in there with the kid and hang out with him. It gives him alot of room to play and crawl. He can stand up and hold on to the sides. He even stood by himself! The other cool thing is that all the toys are in one spot! We have two baskets of toys in there for him to play with.This is portable and light. It's kind of a pain to reshape;(which is why it got 4 stars) but once you have it together, it's pretty sturdy. It's also indoor-outdoor, which is great for people with backyards, decks or pools.Folds up very compactly. You could easily store this in a closet when not in use.Overall, it's a great product to have and well worth the money. I highly recommend it."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This play yard is basically low quality, and useless. Unless you are going to leave it in one spot, and never move or open it...dont buy it! You have to use a ton of force to move the joints, which makes it very difficult to set up and take down. The plastic bends and almost breaks when you try to fold or unfold it. The ""gate"" to get in is so hard to use that it is easier to just step over it. A piece of the plastic was broken when I received it, which makes me think it won't last long. I bought this to use inside and outside, but if I keep it (which I don't plan to) I would never move it because it is so hard to use. Worst joint design I have ever seen!"
1,don't do it,"Mine acted as though it was a lemon; it required brute force to unfold it, hook it together and broke into smal pieces when refolding it to return to Amazon."
5,Fair deal,Bigger than I expected -- plenty for one or two kids. Simple to put together. Sturdy so long as you keep the wall joints at >90 degrees -- rectangles are not sturdy. Heavy duty plastic; we'll lose need for it before it breaks.
4,great for the money,"I bought this for our new pekeapoo, who doesn't know her boundaries yet. It is a great play yard. It not only makes the shape shown, but you can pretty much conform it to the shape of the area you are putting it in. It seems very sturdy, but may get pushed around with a bigger dog/children. The height is great. The only flaw with it would be it's look. It kinda reminds me of a gray milk crate. The design could be a little more for interior use. Other than that, great product for the money!"
2,Defective,When the gate arrived it seemed in fine condition but after we put it up and used it my son broke it just by leaning on it. It is not very strong and I don't recommend it for those who have boys.
4,happy,We have 4 children 3 are 4 and under. This is a big help both in a circle and straight out to keep little ones away from Christmas tree and Fire place. Plan on using outside in nice weather. Much better looking then the plywood we were using.
5,good purchase,This was purchased for our two Borzoi dogs. They are tall but will not jump or challenge the gate. We split the gate in half and used half (three sections) to block off one area and the other half to do the same. It will tip easily of you have a dog that views a barrier as a challenge.
3,It's okay,We only use this to go around the christmas tree and we have used it 2 years now. It works but it is really hard to get it in a circle. The hinges are really really tight.
4,Nice for the price,"The concept is good and it's a decent outdoor enclosure for my chihuahua. But the other day when I was folding it up, part of it cracked. It was only the third time I'd had it out. The connections don't slide easily and I must have used too much pressure. But I'm a 62-year-old woman with tendonitis and carpal tunnel...so I think it was more a problem with the product than the handling. Fortunately I paid half price, so I taped up the cracks rather than return the yard.Maybe I'll eventually get a replacement for the broken section. That's one of the good things...each section is a unit on its own. Other good things: lightweight, portable, can be adjusted to different shapes and sizes."
5,Great safe place to play,"I got this with the extension. It's been great for my twins. There is lots of room for them to play with each other. It also offers me a safe place to put them if I need to do something quick like pour a bottle. It did take some maneuvering to set up because it is large and awkward when you unfold it. It also sounds like you're breaking it because it has ""teeth"" on each hinge that pop into place in small increments (each increment makes a clicking sound). We don't bother to open or close the gate to get in and out, we just step over it. It is sturdy enough that my daughter, who weighs 22lbs now, can pull herself up on it."
