2,Recipes are so-so!!!!,"I bought this book when I was pregnant hoping that it would help me eat right. While the recipes might be healthy, the actual recipes itself aren't too tasty. Also, the pictures don't do it justice. I think I found about three recipes that I actually liked in this book. And these three recipes weren't super great. The times I did make them, I made them mostly since they were healthy and not so much for taste. For me, this wasn't the best book of recipes for pregnant women and if I had done it again, I probably wouldn't have purchased this book. My advice for anyone looking to buy this book is that you should go to a bookstore and look through it. That way you can see for yourself whether you would really like the recipes in this book and if this is something you would really want."
2,Not even healthy!,"I received this book and was shocked that the recipes aren't even healthy! They use butter, sugar, flour, etc. I guess they mean healthy compared to fast food?"
3,"Not bad, not great, but good for washing in cold weather","I bought this to wash my vehicle when it is cold out. I do not have to get my hands wet, so I stay warm. It takes a long time to get winter mud and dirt of, but my hands stay dry, and my vehicle looks better than most of the cars out and about in the snow."
5,amazing,I first heard Joe Purdy from Grey's Anatomy and Lost and looked him up on the internet. I bought one of his albums and then bought Julie Blue and I love them both. Both albums are fantastic and are in heavy rotation in my CD player.
4,"good, but not the best","when I first got into Joe Purdys music this was the cd everyone told me was a ""must have"" it is a good cd but definately not my favorite of his I would suggest you pick up ""stomping grounds"" or one of Joe's other CDs before messing with this one."
4,Fantastic concert DVD,"This is a spirited seventy-two-minute performance by Lou and his band(guitarist Mike Rathke, bassist/backing vocalist Fernando Saunders, drummer Tony ""Thunder"" Smith, and cellist Jane Scarpantoni) from last year. It's not loaded down with overdubs to ""correct"" the rough spots(as opposed to live albums and DVDs from bands like the Stones); a live performance is what it is, and should not be tweaked after the fact. Lou is in fine form--his guitar sound is, as always, immaculate--and so is the band. High points: ""Modern Dance"", ""Why Do You Talk"", ""Venus in Furs"", ""Jesus"", ""Romeo Had Juliette"", ""The Blue Mask"", and ""Perfect Day""."
5,"Good, personal history of Merrill's Marauders","I picked this book up on Amazon.com. This book is written by a 2nd Lieutenant in one of the three battalions of the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional). He was just high enough up in the pecking order to know what was SUPPOSED to be going on, and low enough to know what WAS going on. The Marauders were under General Merrill who General Stillwell at least liked. On the other hand, the Marauders were treated badly when the fighting was over. They weren't taken out of battle soon enough to recover their health. They went on three missions between 24 February 1944 and 17 May 1944, which basically ruined the health (physically and mentally) of Merrill and everyone under him. The Japanese they were fighting were some of the best Infantry that the Imperial Army had ever had, but they weren't the main problem. It was hot, it was a jungle, there were a multitude of diseases, snakes, and their supply wasn't all that reliable. I highly recommend this book."
2,Disappointing and uncaptivating.,The style of writing was one of the poorest I have ever seen. The story just never gets off the ground. Fragmented...
5,I love Young Rider,I am 11 and I read young rider. I find all the info helpful even though I do not own a horse! I definately reccomend this magazine.
4,Great fo Kids Who Love Horses,My daughter loves horses and to ride and this gives her something to look foward to. She loves the posters.
4,Great!!,"This is a great magazine!!It is packed with helpful information,like how to avoid horse show hassles, and how to save money.They have great articals , and I don't zip through the magazine like I usually do.It even comes with 2 horse postars!!They have tons of ads though, and they once sent me the magazine 2 months before they should have.Overall it is a great product."
5,YONG RIDER RULES!![.],I think yong rider rocks!![.] It is my favorite magazine and I get it evry 2 months! I highly reccomend it to any horseaholics that at from 7 to 13.
3,Young Rider Magazine,"Young Rider magazine is an interesting magazine for equestrian children. It provides information and tips regarding horse and pony care, and fun quizzes, puzzles, and posters. However, it is not a magazine that you can expect will teach you how to ride or care for a horse. It is mainly a supplement to help with the everyday reletionship between a rider and a horse, and is most useful when added to the input of a trainer, or equestrian instructor."
2,Mommy and Daddy bought you a pony? This is for you!,"I got this magazine a few years ago and flipping through it recently I see not much has changed. Lots of little girls on their pretty ponies in their perfect stables in designer riding gear...Another thing I dislike is, the absence of minorities like myself. Guess what? There ARE such things as Hispanic or African-Amercian riders. This magazine is obviously geared towards all those stuck-up, rich little girls with their own ponies. Why the 2 stars then? Cuz I loved the posters and there was some good information in it and the writers made it easy for younger kids to understand."
3,Show your Welsh Pony every weekend? This is your magazine.,"I received a subscription of this magazine for one year, and although it has its good points, there were enough bad points to cause me not to renew. The magazine has tons of beautiful, full color posters of beautiful horses and ponies. I really enjoyed the quizzes and short stories, as well as some of the features. But my problem with this magazine was that it seems to lean towards the well-to-do little girls riding Welsh Ponies that are trained to show every weekend. I haven't read an issue yet that didn't contain an article about 'winning lots of ribbons in shows.' There is no focus on the other side of horsemanship: caring for your horse, keeping up your stable, and health care. It is simply assumed the 'young riders' will hand their lovely ponies away to their grooms and saunter off to hang their ribbons on the walls of their bedrooms, which will, presumably, also have the mega posters featured in each issue of the magazine."
2,Great for the beginner,"Young Rider is a great magazine for the beginner- the articles are very simple and easy to understand. They have great posters, but there's usually an article on their backside. There are ads lining almost every page; there isn't nearly as much content as there used to be. The average YR magazine has about 60 pages/9 articles, which usually have half-page pictures. I'd reccomend a magazine such as Practical Horseman or Horse Illustrated for anyone over 13. But, for a young horselover, it's a very helpful resource. There's several pages displaying readers' pictures and stories, along with a few step-by-step articles. Things like coloring and markings are discussed in detail, and many famous events (like the Rolex Kentucky) are reported on. For the completely new English and Western rider, it would make a great gift."
2,Nice poster,"When I was younger I use to go to barnes and noble and flip through young rider. Only reason why I bought it was if there was a nice picture for the huge center poster. Even at a young age the articles seemed ridiculously simple and never actually contained useful information. I ended up subscribing to Horse Illustrated as soon as my parents agreed to pay for it and continued for a few years. If you want nice posters get this. If you want good general magazine you will actually read and learn from that also has nice picture (and its own centerfold, though smaller), get Horse Illustrated."
3,Overall an OK Magazine,"Overall I would say this is an OK magazine. Some of the articles are cute and sometimes even informative, but I find that most of the time the articles are a bit too simple and don't apply to indermediate or advanced riders. Also, there are lots of ads. Not to mention it seems mainly geared towards kids who show a lot and own their own horses. Probably the best thing about this magazine is the pictures and colorful cover. So, if you are a young beginning rider who shows often and owns your own horse, this is the magazine for you."
3,Fun for Awhile,"This magazine is fun for young girls (7-10) who love horses, but it's not so great after the first year. The posters are great, but what does one do with them all? It's hard to throw away a poster of a horse! The information is good, but there is lots of advertising. Lots of great photos."
5,9year old grand daughter,"i have been subscribing to ""young rider"" for 4 years now. my grand daughter has loved this magazine from the begining. she saves all the pictures & posters. she even takes the magazine to horse shows to be autographed by ""stars"" she reads about. our family has standardbreds,so she has always been around horses and she has developed a love and understanding and a talent in the show ring. this magazine has contributed to her growth."
4,Great Gift for my Horse-Crazy 8 Year Old,"My 8 year old daughter is crazy about horses and loves to get mail -- which makes a subscription to Young Rider a natural! Plus, my stealth reason for the gift subscription is fulfilled as well -- to encourage her to read.Young Rider is a high quality publication. Articles address English and Western riding, showing, horse care, horse-world celebrities, horse breeds, and more. The many, many high quality color photographs are beautiful. My daughter particularly enjoys the pull-out posters."
1,Does not include images,"Instead of showing images of things referred to in text it simply states ""GRAPHIC"". Have to look them up online which usually gives away the case ending."
2,Where Are The Dancing Men?,"I received this item and it's nicely bound. While I have not yet read this book, I immediately flipped to 'The Adventure of the Dancing Men' - the images of the dancing men cypher are not reprinted in this book. This is very disappointing."
4,A True Holmesian Case,"So everyone thought he was dead, murdered at the hands of Professor Moriarty. Not so of course (although Conan Doyle had intended to cease writing about Holmes - but a public outcry forced him to reconsider). In this highly affordable collection Holmes and Watson continue to pit their highly developed intellect against the not so refined minds of the criminal underworld - although Holmes does give them due credit for their duplicity. The only problem I find with Conan Doyle's writing is that it is a bit lacking in decent female characterisation - rather a sign of the times than a fault in his writing however."
4,Wordsworth Classics--a facsimile edition,"The soft-cover Wordsworth Classics edition of The Return of Sherlock Holmes reproduces The Hound of the Baskervilles and the short stories that make up The Return of Sherlock Holmes as they originally appeared in the Strand. It also contains the interesting, though poorly reproduced, illustrations that accompanied the stories. Because a page of the magazine is reduced to the size of a trade paperback page, typeface is very small."
3,An easy way for the game theory,"The author talks longer about the decision theory, particullary in two different context, related to the utility and the probability.The formalism is no hard, also we have an approach which considers the traditional questions, therefore he uses the axioms for a theory more apted to the applications. A particular attention must be related to the Arrow theorem, what is descript with many details for the proof,connecting that with the Harsanyi position."
4,content review,The book offers a basic description of what a qualitative study is all about - it gives step by step guidance even a new researcher student will not find any problem in understanding. The language used is simple and very comfortable for reading.
4,Nice pop-up for kids or collectors,"This 20-page (10 layouts with 10 ""pop ups"") book has a question on the left page and the movable piece that reveals the answer on the right. Topics are bug based and include Santa Bug, stocking, wreath, mistletoe, tree, etc. This is not like current pop-up books that have a major event with the turn of a page. These require the reader's manipulation: many pieces move flatly on the page (with a tab pull), some you unfold to reveal the pop up. While this may not dazzle as much initially, it does make it fun for kids as you read the question and they await the movement and answer. And this may mean they can turn the pages because it doesn't require as much care (as, say, a Sabuda pop up). Also, it might not get as destroyed by young, not-so careful readers.Two notes:My copy has a few pages where the tabs are a bit stiff.The last page, which has a light and music, requires the tab to be pushed back in to turn it off (if this isn't done, the battery will wear down)."
2,No lights and music.,"Usual fun ""Bugs"" book except back cover is suppose to have ""Lights and Music"". HOWEVER, both the original and replacement copies, that I received, had dead batteries."
4,Last page doesn't work ...,"My 16 year old nephew enjoyed this book so much when he was young that I wanted to buy it for a new nephew to enjoy. The pop ups throughout the book were just as I remembered them ... but his favorite part of the book was always the last page, where the Christmas tree star lit up and it played some music. I ordered the book the light didn't light, and there was no music. I told Amazon and they gladly sent me another book ... but that one doesn't work either. Maybe they don't make them with music any more, but the light is definitely supposed to light. The copyright is still 1992 ... maybe this is old stock and the battieries are worn out? In any case, the book is fabulous other than that, but just know you might be disappointed in the last page."
2,Bugs without a song,I bought this book as a gift because my kids had loved it so when they were little. The highlight of the book is the end when the star lights up and plays a christmas song. I was very disappointed to find this mechanism was not working.Better to buy this one in the store where you can be sure all the pages work as they should.
1,Worst pop-up book ever !!!,Worst pop-up book ever !!! You will have a tough time finding out where's the light and music. And the so-called pop-ups are so unattractive. Very flimsy construction. Buy it only if you really hate the kid you are giving it to.
5,LOVE THIS BOOK!,I remember buying this book for my son a number of years ago. It's still great - alot of fun and hands-on for the kids. Arrived in perfect condition and on time.
1,No lights no music!,"Just opened delivery box to wrap presents. The book was just thrown in the box. No music, no lights. What to do two days until Christmas. Be careful when you order books with moving parts."
2,Only OK,If you are looking for amazing pop-ups buy the Robert Sabuda books. The push-pull-pop-up features in this book are pretty plain and unexciting. Perhaps very small children will be entertained but my five- and six-year-old were bored. The final page with music and blinking lights on the Christmas tree weren't enough to make them want to read it again.
3,A better title would have been-,"'How to set up and run a video production studio' -- the main problem with this book is it cover so much it only gives the briefest coverage of anything. He covers subjects as basic as surge protectors and laptop computers, printers, scanners.While digital animation proper is reduced to a couple of chapters. Lets take storyboards for instance - four scribbled panels on half a page - a couple of meaningless 'flow charts' and that is all. The animation samples are from the tutorial that comes with max and reproduced in B/W.If you want an overview I suppose this will be a good choice, but if you want to learn 3D CG, find another book"
2,Know what you're getting yourself into,"After having read this book I questioned myself of what subject I have actually learned. Did I read a storybook on the business or did I actually learn to create professional animation with 3ds Max, Lightwave, and Maya? It seems that George Avgerakis is very savvy when it comes to the applications of business for Animation or he would not exist in his present position. As such he does very little in the terms of providing a good example of actually creating professional quality animation. He sells you a completely different book instead, which mind you, with a different cover could tell a better tale. I would like to caution those interested in the applications of this book, there is no technical basis that would categorize this book as a tool to help you produce better work. My conclusion: Money better spent elsewhere."
1,Practically USELESS!,"Read the review by ""Bob - The guy from nowhere"". It's the most accurate description of this book.Don't waste your time or money on this one. It does not do a good job of covering any of the primary points it claims to present. Granted, it would take several books to cover each topic, but even as a general overview it's really not that useful. Digital Animation Bible? I don't think so!At the beginning of the book, the author writes ""I didn't want to open [this book] with a lot of boring stuff about how this book was organized or what you could expect to get out of it."" There is a good reason for that. You will be asking yourself the same question by the end of the book."
1,"not tight enough, balls with washing","I am very disappointed with this product. The color is good and the sheet feels nice, but it doesn't stay tight on the mattress, and it gets those annoying little balls on it with washing (or rubbing). I don't use it any more as I don't think it's safe for my baby."
1,Yucky sheets,"I was very unhappy with the fact that the dots on these sheets are ""painted"" on. The paint is a rubbery, yucky feeling paint that I would not put my baby's skin against. It would have been nice to know from the product description that the design was not woven into the fabric. I wouldn't have bought it in the first place. It's too bad, the sheet itself is a nice color and would have looked great in the nursery."
2,Feels rough despite the higher thread count,"The sheet seems to be made well though it fits a loosely. Despite being made of cotton and having a 220 thread count, it feels quite rough. The only cotton crib sheets I've found so far that feel smoother are Laura Ashley.I ordered blue and in the picture it has a woven or printed dot pattern. That's not what I received. I received solid blue."
5,Super slippers!,Ordered these for my hubby and he loves them! On occasion he needs to go outside and these are great for those special trips. He has even worn them out to dinner on a few occasions. Loves them! Recommend these slippers.
3,Too tight and small,I purchased slippers for a gift for someone else. When they arrived they tried them on and they were too tight and about a half size to small. Sent them back and received a full refund. The slippers did appear to be well made though.
2,"when ""weird"" means ""incomprehensible""","Harlan Ellison has written some many memorable, bizarre stories in his day. However in this collection, 'Deathbird Stories', I am afraid my review is polar opposite of the glowing reviews posted on amazon.com. I really couldn't find anything of value in this book. The stories are almost unintelligible in their incoherent rambling. Rather than cool, these stories are a total mess. I was utterly disappointed. I give it two stars instead of one only because of the author's reputation (...I almost never give one star reviews).Bottom line: not even worth the one dollar I paid for it at a thrift store. A total waste."
4,Testament to a great leader,"While I have not finished the whole of the books yet, I having gone through 1/2 of it that anyone with an interest in history will find it interesting and see why so many people considered Patton a great military leader. I know within the book even when things were happening he had the ability to predict effective courses of action though his brash nature would conflict with his higher up cause some delays in his desire for forward action and then there is some overview of his active combativeness toward Gen Montgomery."
5,A Complex Man,"My father served with Patton for a time, so I am drawn to books about him. Dad rarely spoke of the war, and specifically said little about Patton. All of these years later I really wonder what he thought of him, so I keep buying these books and try to guess.If you have read biographies of Patton you will find this book particularly interesting. Patton was unique in good ways and in bad. Since this book was published after his death from his diaries, it gives a good glimpse of how he saw himself. It's particularly interesting when placed in the context of how the historians see him. The book says nothing of the slapping incidents that got him in such trouble in Sicily, and little about other disciple issues, but gives terrific insight into his vision of conducting successful warfare. This book is a must for those interested in World War II."
3,Unpolished but informative,"Written like a private diary not intended for publication, Patton rambles through every week, month and engagement in which he superintended with personal anecdotes, historical quips, troop and corps movements, successes and failures, complaints about the high command, commendations for his staff, and nostalgic perspectives about Europe from his days in WWI. As a whole, this work is disjointed and picaresque. There are a great number of Pattonisms here though which pique the reader for the more notorious and famous episodes in the general's bright career. Since this is his only work, it belongs on the shelves of WWII enthusiasts, but as a classical reference on the war, it suffers greatly."
4,In his own words,"Unfortunately, Patton doesn't describe the battle planning to the degree I had hoped. Too much high level discussions of this Battalion and that Regiment. But some good insight into his relationship with Monty and Ike."
5,All leaders should read this.,Patton' memoir of his role in WWII. Written shortly before his death in Dec 1945 and published by his wife. Patton example of leadership is applicable to all leaders and all leaders would benefit by reading this book. Appended to this book are copies of Patton's general orders for the conduct of the 3rd Army in Europe which includes some very good practical advice for the fighting soldier and commander.
3,War From a Distance,"I was quite disappointed with this book. Given its title, I was not prepared to spend endless pages reading about his non-military activities. Often it was basically travelogue and who was present at formal luncheons. Much of the coverage of the various campaigns was more listing of the order of battle with little description of the tactics, strategy and events of the battles. The last 85 pages, however, made my purchase seem more worthwhile but I would recommend checking it out at a library."
3,Honest account from a one eyed war horse,".... man did [Patton] know how to fight a war. I would want him leading a column into battle, but not running the war. He just was too direct to be a great leader.This book is insightful and honest. Just like the man. I enjoyed it and was reminded of a few of the poorer boses that I have had. I think it was true that he was born a few centuries too late.The book is a good read about a not so good man-but a great field general."
2,Interresting,"This book was difficult for me to follow. It seemed to be written more like a diary or personal notes and maybe he didn't have time to fill in the blanks. To tell you how confused I was, one moment I thought I was in North Africa and the next he's talking about Italy. I said, ""when did I get to Italy?"" On the other hand, you do get a feel for who Patton was and he does give some good advice for tactics and he had some very interresting views of how digging fox holes dropped [spirits]. I didn't notice any mention of him slapping the soldier that he took so much heat over.I'm not going to give up on his writing and will some day try to read another book by him. So with that in mind I would recommend trying something else. Either another book of his or as I have done but not read yet, a book by Omar Bradley, ""A Soldiers Story."""
2,One-side view,flamboyant and irrealistic data of german losses ( see german sources ...KTB/OKW. etc. )
1,Keeps out bugs but also air...,"While the mesh was small enough to keep out even the little ""no see-um"" bugs, it was also not allowing the air to flow as freely. The one we received was also damaged, so I was able to return it easily. Very disappointing."
5,Well written and inspirational,"This is a fine and inspirational account of a man who relied on God in his time of need. I would say that people who are struggling with their faith in God should read this book. Each chapter has scriptural references which relate very well to the chapter and Stanley Praimnath's experiences. It will help the reader understand God's grace and love, as well as improve his or her knowledge of the Bible. Mr. Praimnath has put his faith into action after the World Trade Center disaster as well, and his accounts after that infamous day are no less fascinating than what occurred in the WTC on 9/11."
1,Horrible Quality,"I purchased this bracelet for a gift. It appeared to be a beautiful bracelet but it fell apart! The pieces of jade separated from the gold/silver part of the bracelet. When the gift was opened, the bracelet fell apart. The recipient glued it with a jeweler's glue but 10 days later another piece came apart. Horrible, horrible quality. I was very embarrassed. Purchasers BEWARE!"
2,How Boring Things Are Made,"Got this one at a yard sale and I'm very glad I only paid 50 cents for it. A collection of chapters describing how many things you don't care about are made, seemingly picked at random. Rubber bands? Pencils? Nail polish? Salsa? Salsa??? How about water: how is water made?There are many interesting devices and objects that are manufactured in clever and creative ways. Few of them are in this book. There's a couple of interesting subjects: jet engines, guitars, helicopters. But some are very incomplete - the chapter on watches focuses entirely on electronic quartz watches. They completely ignore the many mechanical watches that are still made on assembly lines and by skilled craftsmen. I'd pass on this one, or contact me and I'll sell you my copy for 50 cents."
2,Simple minded,Lots of interesting explanations. Poor pictures. Total lack of detail to make room for quantity. Cute but no big deal. To the point of boring.
1,HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT -no value for money,"You might as well have someone pick up a history of costume book, read it out loud and show you the pictures.This DVD is too expensive. It shows still pictures found in all costume books, and gives you a very superficial account on the history of fashion.I do not recommend it to anyone.The quality is terrible and even though information states that it has been released in 2004, it stops at th late eighties or early 90's"
4,Great filter,"It's a great filter, but I ended up returning it because my lens cap wouldn't close properly with this thing on. The low-profile design just didn't work well with my Canon 10-22mm lens."
2,Travel + Leisure magazine,I ordered this subscription 4 weeks ago -- going on 5 weeks. And still I wait for any form of communication from the publisher. I hope this weak start isn't a harbinger of things to come with this publication.
1,Never got the magazine,"As of today, I am still waiting to receive Travel & Leisure magazine. I am not sure what happened to my subscription that I had paid for? Would love to find out who I need to contact at Amazon to resolve this matter?"
3,Lap of luxury,"Travel and Leisure is a glossy, glamorous publication, one that's a treat to leaf through on a cold winter's evening. Its focus on ""the best"", while interesting enough, is utterly useless for the average American who must travel on a budget. Once in a while, a photo or an article from this magazine will prompt me to look into a town or region to visit, but as far as practical suggestions go, there's a glaring absence. While the glitzy 4 star hotels are impressive, staying in little known, cozy and comfortable, local inns, or even renting a vacation house, is our first choice, but T & L is of no help with that."
1,2.5 months later and still nothing,"Ordered this magazine as a Christmas gift. Mid February, he's yet to receive his first issue!"
3,"Beautiful, but...","T&L is a visually appealing travel mag, but they seem to be slipping on the editorial side lately. I'm always enticed at the newstand to pick it up and flip through, but I find myself buying less and less these days, because there isn't as much substance behind it as there used to be.The rare times that I do buy is when there's an article about an area that I'm about to go to, or want to go to. Even in these cases, I find that some research online, augmented by CN Traveler, does the job much more efficiently. Don't get me wrong; I still *like* T&L; it's just that most of the value I get from it can be much more effectively accessed on their Web site, under 'destinations.'If you want a useful travel magazine, try CN Traveler. If you want eye candy for travel, I'd suggest something like Wallpaper (alas, they've somewhat fallen off the pedestal as well, but that's a different review...)."
3,Travel and Leisure Magazine,"I'm sure this is a great magazine. I wouldn't know as I haven't received it yet. I ordered 4 magazines 11/30/09 and have only received one issue. They said it would be 4-6 wks. Now they're saying 2/14/10. I'm sure all the magazines are fine. The service, not so great."
3,Not Too Helpful,I can find the info in this magazine by just going online (I may even get better deals online).
1,Very Disappointed,"I ordered this subscription on November 30. It is now February 1st and still have yet to see an issue, or even recieve a confirmation that my order was received. Were it not for the fact that I was already billed in full, I would have guessed that my transaction was somehow lost. Very disappointed and still waiting for an answer from Customer Service."
3,WRONG PRICE!,I was quoted a price of $5.00 and was charged $12.95 for this Travel & Leisure subscription. I tried to correct it but just finally gave up.
1,Long Wait,Funny that I received the email from Amazon asking for my review of this product considering I haven't received it! My credit card was charged on 12/2 and I have yet to receive a magazine (as of 1/31). Maybe it's the timing of when it is sent out? Who knows.
4,Nice enough magazine,"I enjoy this magazine, but I am downsizing my paper subscriptions, and I really don't read this enough to make it worth it to continue the subscription. I enjoy the magazine for virtual travel, but I can easily find it at the library, and spend an hour with it there."
1,Fuzzy Out of Focus Photography,"Travel & Leisure was once the best travel magazine. Now I rate it the worst. Endlessly trendy, hopelessly chic. It's fru-fru. My biggest complaint is the photography. Seems the editors have told their photographers to shoot only over-exposed, overly white fuzzy photos. And there is this irritating penchance for illustrating their articles with full page photos of local inhabitants. DUH! Thum through any issue at the newstand and see what I mean. Try ""Conde Nast Traveler"" instead."
5,great,my daughter and her husband travel a lot and they love this magazine to get ideas for their next trip
5,The Nightwish Ballads,"""Sleeping Sun"" contains four ballads and to my opinion, the best ballads that Nightwish has recorded. The EP opens with the single ""Sleeping Sun"", a gentle, calm but beautiful song. The second song is my personal favourite: ""Walking In The Air"". It is so dreamy and really makes you want to 'walk in the air'. The thirth song is ""Swanheart"", a very emotional piano-ballad which shows that Tarja really can sing. The last song is ""Angels Fall First"", taken from the debutalbum which has the same name. This is the most emotional song on the EP, it's simple but very beautiful.All of the songs on this EP can be found on other Nightwish-albums but it's still worth buying it (especially for fans), because it's a good album if you're in the mood for something calm and emotional. It's not just a random collection of soft and regular slow song, but a great selection of Nightwish's best ballads!"
2,Metal clip prone to breaking,Metal clip is tight. I find it has to bend a bit to fit on my fairly normal belt. Lasts about a month and then the metal clip becomes dislodged. On my fourth now. Would probably be fine if you were attaching to something thinner like cloth.
3,Be careful...,"This is an OK tool for someone to play with alone. If you are accustomed to the real Bolling/Rampal recording, this recording will take some getting used to. I do not believe that it would be quite appropriate if you are looking to perform with this accompaniment live. The bassist is frequently questionable in his pitch (especially when in unison with the LH of the piano). The tempos are sometimes accurate to the original, sometimes not (Sentimentale probably the worst). Fluctuation of internal tempos will most assuredly warrant more rehearsal with the accompaniment than you may want to put into it.Personally, I would use this tool if I were preparing this piece for a recital and could not get the rhythm section together very often for rehearsals."
1,"John, Son of Thunder","This is the 14th book that I have read written by this same author. I find her novels to be compelling and her writing is so riveting, that it is almost impossible to put them down. Her novels are on Biblical characters; and though I consider my self a fair Biblical scholar; I grab the Bible to look up anything I don't remember; and find it is there. Maybe not in the way I remembered but there. It is a great way to learn about Biblical characters, in that she gives them feet and you can walk around with them. I am starting on Gabriel-The War in Heaven now. I would and have recommended her books to many people. In fact, I loan out some to friends that I know will give them back.: I believe that ""John, Son of Thunder"" is her best book so far."
5,"Wonderful, WONDERFUL book! A must read!",This is a great book for those who enjoy historical fiction. Ellen goes to great lengths to portray John's life right along with the Biblical account! An amazing book!
3,Arrived Broken,"Did not know how to contact you, but I have not been able to use it once, unless I want to make real skinny pizzas (and two of them) I can not use this product at all.."
5,"Mussorgsky fans, make this album a part of your collection!","I am currently in the process of building my library of classical music, so I decided to buy this album containing some of Mussorgsky's most famous works. I studied Modest Mussorgsky (1839-1881) in my Music Literature class, and ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" was one of the works examined in our textbook. All that is to say that I am quite satisfied with my purchase of this album! The overall sound quality is superb, and the performances from the Prague Symphony Orchestra are crisp. The wonderful ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" is performed in its entirity. The album concludes with the original version of ""Night on Bald Mountain,"" which should be a treat for Mussorgsky purists! I highly recommend this to those who are beginning to have an interest in classical music. It also makes for a solid and enjoyable musical introduction to the works of one of Russia's most prolific Romantic composers."
1,Not a very good book for parents,"We had a ""family bed"", and am glad we made that choice. But I also totally support people who do NOT have a family bed. The thing about this book is that it so one sided, and will make you feel guilty if you do not choose this parenting option.Parents, the family bed is an option! That is all! Do what works for your family, and do not feel guilty. Books like this make you feel like there is only one way, and you are doing it wrong if you do not choose that one way."
2,Poorly Written,"This book was poorly written. The author's thoughts meandered in chapters that barely focused on any main point. Definitely not something to recommend to someone who is a skeptic regarding co-sleeping. Although it deserves respect for pioneering on writing on the subject, there are much, much better sources for learning about the family bed. I recommend ""Good Nights."" It is clear, concise, and gives you more practical information."
5,This book could save the world!,"The Family Bed is an extraordinary book which taught us much more than simply sharing sleep with our child. It helped us to ""get it"" that children can and should be trusted, and that they deserve to have their needs met with love, understanding, and compassion both day and night.It would be difficult to find a more important book for parents, or, indeed, for anyone who cares about the future of our society. It is ""the"" gift for new parents.Jan Hunt, M.Sc., author of The Natural Child: Parenting from the Heart"
3,The Family Bed,"I received the book quickly, it was a bit more 'Used"" than had been stated, but still ok for my own use, but not to give to someone else. It would have been good to have a more accurate description of the condition."
1,The lost touch with your husband book.,"Although Ms. Thevenin claims a 1987 copyright on this book, I read it (or an earlier version) in the mid-to late 70's. I was so inspired by her that I tossed the crib. My husband and I slept with all three of our children. Each new one kicking the other out at about age two. Its hard enough maintaining a secret, intimate, sexual relationship when kids come. With a ""family bed"" it is impossible. We became a ""family"" but really lost our desire for each other. Maybe the bed sharing did not cause this, but for many years now (my ""kids"" are 23, 21, and 18) I have wondered how much it contributed to our divorce. We parted friends, but not lovers. My advice: go the ""American"" way and be selfish about your relationship with your husband. The kids are terrific, but they leave. Hopefully, he'll stick around. Marty"
2,Only adequate,"The author obviously has an axe to grind, so her discussion is one-sided. I read my sister's copy of this book, as she practices the family bed. She also has children who can ONLY be put to bed by their parents lying down with them. Since we have this great thing called electricity many parents prefer to stay up a little later than their children, but the children grow to rely on the parental snuggling to fall asleep. It makes the children difficult to put to bed when babysitting for them (or in this case, impossible!) Also there is some silly ""historical"" type chat that seems anecdotal and unscientific. I can't wait until therapists get these family bed kids on the couch! What will we learn about parental reliance on their children for filling their emotional needs?"
5,This book worked for my family - it's beautiful.,"This book is really wonderful. My husband and I read it before our baby was born, and felt that it made good sense. We loved seeing our baby and young child so happy and secure with us. He's grown now, and we always felt the closeness and security contributed to his self confidence. This book presents a good argument about why it doesn't make sense to isolate the youngest and most helpless members of the family."
2,There have got to be better books out there,"This book basically gave me all the reasons why cosleeping is a good idea (which I had already decided). What it didn't do was give me any help at all at dealing with the difficulties we encountered. I needed advice on helping my child not to stay attached to my nipple all night, just because I was there, how to get him to sleep before my bedtime, and how to maintain intimacy with my husband, particularly while dealing with the first two problems. All of these have solutions that we continue to work out for ourselves, but this author's comments were not helpful. Being told that sleep wasn't really that necessary, or that I don't really need a sex life was not going to make my husband supportive at all, and I wasn't too happy about it either. Try elsewhere."
2,"Not sure why this book is ""The Bible""","We co-sleep and love it, but this book wasn't much of a help. Three in a Bed is better, and the Sears' Baby Book is best. With the latter, you're also getting a lot more for your money, since it covers all aspects of child care and illness."
3,Pretty Dry,Unless you are REALLY interested in who the heavy hitters in the insurance business were over sixty years ago this probably isn't for you. Brief biographies on the men who were early members of The Million Dollar Round Table is the premise of the book.
4,Vanity Fair,Gossipy and fun to read and sometimes revealing and thought-provoking. A peek into the materialistic and casually avante guard world of the society pages and the otherwise in-crowd.
3,Searching for Content,"This magazine has quite in depth articles about a wide variety of `general interest' topics. I found many of the articles to be a bit longer than they should have been and they just drag on towards the end. The content reminds me of Reader's Digest for a slightly younger generation. There are occasional racy topics and cursing, but not enough to turn me off. Examples of topics in one issue: Jewish power and peril, an architect, a sex club, September 11, Vanity Fair covers, and some common monthly features. At least half of the magazine is fashion advertisements, and because of the amount of advertising, the magazine weighs a lot and is not useful for bringing anywhere. If the articles were of a proper length and there was a normal amount of advertising, this magazine would be the size of any normal magazine, the rest is just filler."
5,Vanity Fair subscription,I have loved the magazine for years and decided it would be smarter to subscribe. The first issue came a month earlier than I expected in perfect condition. This was a wonderful buying experience.
3,Love the Photography,"The only reason I like this magazine was because of the photography in it. I find most of the articles boring, or not to my tastes. I do enjoy the photography. There is an occasional interesting article, but I am a photographer, and all that interests me in this magazine are the photos. I like that it is cheap for a year's subscription too."
1,Disappointing,"I used to be a fan of Vanity Fair, until I finally, after months of trying to ignore it, got fed up with the liberal ramblings of Graydon Carter. Why can't he figure out that we're just not that interested in his personal political opinions? He has taken a revered magazine and used his position to further his personal beliefs; mostly ranting and blathering on and ON and ON and ON and ON and ON about the evil conservative forces in Washington. Graydon--SHUT IT!! I'm sad, because I so dearly miss Dominick Dunne's brilliant writing and the genuinely interesting articles that can usually be found in each issue, but I won't subscribe again till Graydon is gone. I hope I don't have to wait too long."
1,Smut!!!!!!!!,"Those Versace Ads displaying female frontal nudity disgust me!!!Although my husband likes ""Vanity Fair"" I have to make an extra effort to keep it away from our children who might confuse it for a smut rag with those Versace Ads!!!!!!!"
5,Magazine review,"This is the best ""all around"" magazine I've read. Plenty of current topics and insights into people and celebrities done in an intelligent way. Information pertinent to men and women. It's the only magazine I read from cover to cover...and that's a lotof reading since it's so full of information."
4,Great magazine!!,I have been subscribing to Vanity Far for 4 years now and I simply love it. The articles range from enertainment news to current political issues. It is a really a diverse magazine. The ads are always great and any Anne Lebovitz picture is always a treat.
4,Great magazine,"I would disagree slightly to say that this magazine engages in celebrity gossip. Yes you might read something with a different perspective on a certain person than you normally see, such as George Bush or Barbara Walters. The writing is very good for the most part, I think ""literary journalism"" is a good way to describe it.Yes, there's always an extremely goodlooking person on the cover, with a feature article, and you might get some dirt that way, but there are all sorts of topics featured in the magazine. The writing is such that you'll find yourself reading the whole magazine, and reading about people and things you didn't necessarily think about before, nor did you originally plan to read them when you picked up the magazine.I highly recommend this magazine."
3,Good - but gets cheeky,"I have read and loved Vanity Fair for years, but dropped my subscription several years ago when moving and never renewed. Why? Because the magazine varies in quality so much from month to month. I hate the Hollywood and Music issues which play to Vanity Fair's weakness for celebs and telling already known stories of their lives. I love their real articles - focusing on world events or politics from a more human angle. I much prefer at this point to simply buy the VF's that look interesting on the shelf than subscribe and run the risk of being disappointed."
3,Entertaining,"I've been reading Vanity Fair for around 12 years. One thing I will never understand is the subscription price. Each month my magazine comes and is filled with $12 slips for a one year subscription. Then my renewal notice rolls around and they offer me the ""Low, Low price for subscribers of only $16 dollars a year.""Do they think I am so stupid that I can not open my magazine and see that the going yearly rate is $12? It kills me. Every single year this happens. I can't take a bath and read this mag and not be showered with the $12 notices so I always let my subscription lapse and renew with one of the $12 cards. I enjoy reading the magazine a lot but I always feel insulted when it comes time to renew."
1,Vanity Fair,"Received April 2009 issue, but no May although it has been on newsstands for some time. Sent email to Conde Nast via their website with no response."
3,Ok,"Hard to find a good article in VF. It takes a few minutes to skim through unless they have a good article like the one on Truman Capote an issue or two back. Vanity Fair does publish great articles, but it's hit or miss each month."
2,Blah....,"I bought the Angelina Jolie issue in store and skimmed through the magazine. At the time I thought it was a pretty good magazine despite all the ads. Fast forward a few months and I now realize I have a magazine subscription to a boring magazine. Each month the mag is full of ads, I don't really enjoy the substance in it or the writing style. I think I got in over my head on this one. To each their own though."
3,get out your bifocals!,"I have mixed feelings about this magazine. I purchased a subscription because I wanted to read the cover stories several times when I saw it on a magazine rack, not really knowing much about the magazine. Well, the cover stories are great, in fact, there are always several long, in depth feature articles that are wonderful. However, too much society fluff that I don't care the slightest about. Worst though, is the actual magazine--the print size is miniscule!! Very difficult to read, even with the bifocals on! Also, too many perfume inserts."
2,Have not received my 1st issue yet,"I wished I would have heeded the other reviews about magazine delivery service. I was lured by the great prices, but delivery has been inconsistent. My Vanity Fair subscription was placed a month ago, and I have yet to receive my first issue. To be fair, the delivery date was stated as 5/20, but honestly how long should it take to mail a magazine? I love the magazine, so this review is more about the magazine delivery then the content in Vanity Fair."
4,Great stories with a little gossip included.,"I enjoyed reading the first two issues sent. I especially enjoy the more serious stories, but also enjoy the little bit of gossip included. Good product reviews too. Thanks."
4,Love!,"Have always loved Vanity Fair. It gives you a peek into the lives of the notorious, rich and famous without being a gossip rag. Great writing."
4,Great Articles,"Vanity Fair really deserves a 5 star rating, but the obvious liberal bias rubs me the wrong way. Having said that, I do rely on Vanity Fair for information I don't find elsewhere.Ordering magazines via Amazon gets 5 stars. Amazon rarely disappoints."
2,"Hey, I'm a ""Professional Subscriber""!","I just went online to see how much a year's subscription in Canada would cost me - it said $38.00. So how come I just received a notice to renew my subscription, with a threat that I need to act by Sept. 15th to ""maintain my Professional Subscriber status""?? And my ""special price"" is only - you guessed it - $38.00. What a bunch of B...S.... you guys are peddling!! Come on - just be honest ok? So far, I've though you were a pretty classy magazine, but now?......###&&&%%%% Bet you won't post or print this."
1,Didn't get it yet!,I ordered Vanity Fair on May 8th and still have not received the magazine as of 6/09.
3,Vanity Fair,"Don't know the history of this magazine. Thought we would try it for a year. Have been getting ""The New Yorker"".....so this is quite different. We think it's too heavily based on appealing to those who might want to aspire to the pictures. But it's name is true....vanity. Writing is ok....more self perpetuating....nothing that lifts beyond the realm of materialism."
4,Intelligent Entertainment,"Relevant, sometimes topical but always well written pieces on a wide range of topics. I miss Christopher Hitchens but fortunately there are still a lion's share of literary greats who continue to contribute."
1,vanity fair mag,"Very Disappointed.They began my subscription with an issue that is already over two months behind the newsstand. Typical corporate crap...! Like reducing the value of the subscritpion by 20 percent or so.Thanks alot Amazon, I will not forget who organized this consumer rip-off.SWC"
2,Wait time for product and follow through are not good,"Product description does state 6- 10 weeks before delivery. That being said, there is supposed to be a post card sent to the recipient of the order, this was not done. The estimated delivery dates on Amazon's site are in conflict with each other, in one place it states delivery in Sept or October and on another page it states first delivery on November 3rd, hmmmm that would place delivery 75 days after ordering. Really! this is 2010, should anyone have to wait for 75 days. I could take a covered wagon to the publisher and tell him in person of my order and then return home and come back in 3 weeks to pick it up myself before they could get it to me in 75 Days!"
4,Upscale People Magazine,"Vanity Fair is head and shoulders above ""People"" magazine. It targets those uppty folks who won't read those fashion rags, but still want to know about the rich and famous. Sometimes its really good reading but mostly I could care less. Exception is the murder and mayhem from the expose of the Show jumping (horses) circuit. (Re-written into the book ""Hot Blood"", which if you missed it is a great read into the greed of rich people. You'd have thought that there was such a thing as so much money you wouldn't have to cheat insurance companies but I guess I didn't factor in the cost of a top rated jumping horse.) The covers have in the past been very cutting edge. Anyone remeber the issue with Demi Moore in full body paint and a minor shadow? But who is dating who on the movie sets is not what I care about. If you do, get this one over the others."
3,People magazine for the literate.,"Vanity Fair has, in its modern incarnation, always made me feel queasy: it's an odd mix of celebrity gossip, investigative journalism, and smart, literate, incisive writing. It veers, with schizophrenic gusto, between the shallowest kind of obsession with wealth, fame, and celebrity, and superbly-written pieces on politics and social issues.Regular columnist James Wolcott does some of the most interesting writing out there on popular culture. On the other hand, Christopher Hitchens is bitter, brittle and snotty, month after month. I have never been able to bring myself to subscribe to Vanity Fair -- I am too conflicted -- but find myself buying about half of their issues on the newsstand."
2,Used to be the best,"About two years ago, Vanity Fair was not only the best magazine of the year, but maybe all time. I would read it from cover to cover.Now, sadly, it is a bunch of fluff. The quality has really gone downhill. I am going to let my subscription run out. I really miss the old days."
4,High Quality Celebrity Gossip,"One of the great treasures of this magazine is Annie Liebowitz's photography. The photography makes me feel a bit like a voyeur. Articles by Dominick Dunne can sometimes be droll, but if you're looking for the epitome of jet-setting, style and glamour in your celebrity gossip, look no further. This magazines uncovers the relationship between Al Gore and Bill Clinton to Gwyneth Paltrow's relationship with Ben Affleck. And you look smart having it on your end table."
1,Beware; RENEWAL SCAM!!!,"This is my very first negative review on Amazon -- or anywhere else, for that matter. Moreover, I've become a die-hard Amazon fan.However, I feel compelled to warn others about what Vanity Fair is doing with these subscriptions. I had signed up for a one-year subscription at a great rate, which is usually the case with Amazon.Now, nine months later, I just received a letter from Vanity Fair, informing me that my subscription is about to be automatically renewed for another year at $32.95 -- nearly twice the price of the original subscription. To avoid the charge, I then had to call the Company and work through their automated network until I got to the correct automated robo-voice.We look forward to the magazine, and think it's great reading. However, they should be ashamed of practices like this. They should be getting subscribers by virtue of the value of the product -- not by underhanded automatic renewals at ridiculously inflated prices."
1,deceptive advertising,"I've never thought of Amazon as a place to subscribe to magazines. I won't use it again either. The deceptive advertising that was used made me think that the 2 magazines that I subscribed to were part of a deal that was being offered. When I checked later, I discovered that they were not and I would have to deal directly with the magazine to change it. I got no better ""deal"" than using the flyers in the magazine directly."
4,decent timetable,"I enjoy Vanity Fair and like the streamlined presentation...not a lot of ads. Good subscription, did not take too long to start enjoying. had purchased one as first issue came late in month, but subscriber will extend subscription date."
1,I only received the first issue of a 2-yr subscription !!!,I almost thought I didn't subscribe it successfully and got the first one. And then I've never seen any other issues till I got reminder from Amazon asking me to renew... seriously ??!!
3,Vanity Fair MOSTLY PORN. CHEAP POLITICAL STUFF,"This magazine is a gift . It is not to be sent to me!!!!send this magazine to: Stacey FinleyFifth Third Bank2600 Zion RoadMD K47741Henderson, KY 42420I've written you and called you twice about this order!!!WHAT INEFFICIENCY!!!"
1,Magazine,I have yet to receive this subscription. What is taking so long? I have never had such a delay.
1,Try Vanity Trash,"Never mind the near naked women photos, the articles look like they were written by two year olds on a cheap PC Computer. Just wind. No fact finding, no uncovering news from reliable sources, NOTHING. It is trash magazine that has Gossip which makes the National Enquier look good."
5,HARD RO PUT DOWN!!,"Excellent magazine, the articles are hard to put down, pictures and fashions are up to date!! This is a MUST HAVE!"
4,Excellent magazzine but...,"This is my 1st year of subscription, since May 09, and I enjoy very much the Editorial Contents, Photography and Design, that's really interesting Magazzine and for a very good price at Amazon.I received August 2009 issue, but no the new ones, although it has been on newsstands for some time. I'll write to Customer Service too, cause I want to know where is the deliver problem. Thanks a lot for your quick answer."
5,Great Zine,"I've always wanted to subscribe to this magazine. Occasionally, I would pick up a copy at the news stand. Amazon offered a great price for a great magazine which encouraged me to go ahead & subscribe. I just received my first issue yesterday. The cover photo is of a young, beautiful & elegant Jackie Kennedy. Looking forward to reading this article about the Kennedys as well as so many other interesting articles in this issue. Even the ads are enjoyable to look at. In these trying times that we live in this magazine is entertaining & shows a side of life that few of us know."
5,"My monthly ""novel""","Whenever my new issue arrives, my spouse refers to it as my ""novel"". I always enjoy a month of interesting reading, often involving subjects I thought held no interest for me until I read the well-written article. A reviewer mentioned having issues never arrive--this is not a problem unique to Amazon subscriptions, as my subscription was purchased directly from the magazine and I have had 2 issues not arrive. When I went to the magazine website to report this, there was no response. I hope that these incidents are rare (I have subscribed for many years) and I continue to be entertained and informed on a wide variety of subjects."
1,Never Arrived,I ordered this magazine subscription on December 15. It is now February 11. Have not received one magazine yet. FURIOUS.
1,Timing is all,"This should be zero stars. This purchase of a subscription to Vanity Fair was supposed to be a birthday gift. Though ordered in September, it has yet to be started. Amazon knew that it might be sent later, so why are they asking for a review of something that has yet to be delivered?"
1,Really delayed delivery,It's a little ridiculous that I placed this order on 15 August and am not going to get a subscription until November...
2,Dumbest magazine I've ever read,"Why do I say that this is one of the dumbest magazines I've ever read? It's because this magazine is pretty trashy but pretends that it's full of high-style, wealth-related, prestigious, and amazing content. It isn't. While most people would argue that magazines such as Us Weekly are even more trashy than this one, don't be fooled. Us Weekly, Glamour, and all those other lower-class gossip/fashion magazines are in many ways more fun to read because they're trashy but are able to own their trashiness. This magazine presents the views only high-style poseurs have. The first rule about money: only the nouveaux riche flaunt it. This magazine lacks political and cultural sophistication. So take your pick: either subscribe to a stereotypically ""lower-class"" magazine that is honest, or subscribe to an even more artsy, actual high-class magazine. This mag fails on all fronts."
1,Amazon's Amazing Overcharge,"You can renew your Vanity Fair subscription at a rate of 24 issues for $20, if you do so on Vanity Fair's website.Amazon, on the other change, charges a renewal rate of $19.99 for only 12 issues.What's with the markup, Amazon?"
5,"Exquis, magnifique, superbe verbe et texture","Ce livre est un chef-d'oeuvre que l'on déguste du début à la fin et que l'on apprécie de plus en plus à chaque relecture. J'adore Boris Vian et l'aurait marié sans mme y penser après avoir lu ce qui coule de sa plume. Les mondes qu'il crée sont fascinants, et celui-ci est le plus beau de tous."
5,The Universe and Dr. Einstein,"Who would believe that a book on the Theory of Relativity could be written for the masses? Well it was, and this is it. The concepts that the book conveys are mind boggling, yet quite understandable at the same time. You'll never view space, time and the world around you the same again. It's a quick read, but as you'll learn, time is relative."
3,The Universe and Dr. Einstein,"This book is 50 years old -- good for a historical reference to the then knowledge of the implications of relativity, but obviously these views are way out of date. Recent books by Stephen Hawking would be much more informative."
5,Einstein's theories made clear for everyone.,"No wonder American students can't compete with foreign students, because wonderful books like this aren't available to them. This is one of the best ever books about explaining a complex scientific theory to ordinary people with no scientific background, but a good head on their shoulders. I've treasured my copy over the years and have referred to it many times when I needed to set my thinking straight while reading advanced cosmology works. This should be a supplemental textbook in every high school science class."
3,almost entirely worthless as a collection,"I'm a HUGE Fall fan. So when I spent money on the Castle/Sanctuary release containing every Peel session, I trusted my favorite reissue label that they would include a lot of stuff I didn't already own. But if you went and bought Castle/Sanctuary's Fall reissues, then you pretty much have the majority of what's on here. There are some exception, particularly in the 'Frenz Experiment' and late 90s eras but, now that other labels have copied Castle/Sanctuary's 'every recording imaginable' policy for bonus tracks on the actual studio album reissues, you only get about a disc and a half of stuff you wouldn't already have owned. Luckily I bought it cheap and the 'Bend Sinister' - 'I Am Kurious Oranj' haven't been reissued. So it gets 3 since it's still the Fall but I already own most of this."
3,Needs to be better organized,"Given the complexity of VPN I was hoping to find a book that could explain key technologies in a concise and an organized manner. ""VPNs Illustrated"" does contain a wealth of technical information, but it failed on both counts.The book offers unnecessary detail when trying to explain key concepts. It is so disjointed that the author is reduced to constantly referring the reader to other chapters to find information that is needed to understand a specific topic area. For example, the critical topic of IPSec is first introduced during a discussion of L2TP.The book contains factual errors such as a typo describing ""OC4"" when the author meant to say OC48.Overall, I was very disappointed with this text. It needs to be proofread and completely reorganized."
4,Inspiring,Very good video that helps us see the miracles that God gives us each and every day. You only have to look and believe to know this is true and this video helps you see what you may have been missing.
5,Miraculous,So worth getting if you would like to see God interacting and loving on His children. Great documentary. Thanks for making this film.
3,The concept is great,Not sure how I feel - somewhere between It's Okay and I Like It. Just getting into the whole idea about healing and how that is done. Good content showing you how healing is being done around the globe and that healing IS something being done now - not just back in Jesus' time.
5,God is good!,"Great movie! I am always touched again when seeing God doing what He does best: expanding His kingdom through His people by acts of love. This movie clearly shows that God is still a God of miracles, and that He loves us through them. I love it!"
5,Buy it! God's love i real,"I have been raise to be skeptical and cautious about miracles or any ""strange"" spiritual experience. which is contradictory to the same God I was taught to believe who did all the wonders and miracle in the bible. This film answers my questions and helps me to understand God's love out of the box. I cried so many times throughout the film just because it shows how much God loves us."
5,Gobsmacked!,"Saw this film last night and am buying it today. I have met most of the leaders shown in this film, and have heard them speak of the miracles that led to faith. Still, to see it actually happen leaves me utterly astounded. The supernatural *is* God's natural for the Christian life. View this with your friends (both believers and nonbelievers) then just love them and watch what God will do!"
5,Kingdom Come In Power,Shows the Love and power of Christ! Not about the manifestations alone. Very well put together. Just a taste of what God is doing. A great gift for the believer and unbeliever. Even those who frequently see the power of God would appreciate this. Such a variety. Praise God!
3,So close...,"Aelita is a fascninating movie, with some enjoyable comic effect. Then the plot takes an Uzi to its own foot at the end. Still, the artwork is magnificient, and the movie deserves to be seen just for that. Just try not guffaw at the end of the film."
3,AELITA - QUEEN OF MARS!,"No, this is not some sort of 1950's space babe film! AELITA is a science-fiction SILENT film from the early days of SOVIET cinema! REALLY! The FUTURISTIC SETS here rival those of ""Metropolis"" (which was made three years later)! The story is quite simple! An engineer in Moscow builds a SPACESHIP to travel to MARS so he can meet the GIRL of his dreams! Of course, once he gets there, instead of romance, he becomes involved in a REBELLION by the PROLETARIATE! Are you really surprised? This is a SOVIET film from 1924! Almost TWO HOURS long! Directed by Yakov Protazenov! A FASCINATING film! This DVD also features an ORCHESTRAL score! So none of that organ music nonsense for this film!"
2,Terrible image quality!,"Of all the editions of this film available in the world this one (the USA Image Edition DVD) has the worst image quality. It is extremely blurry and out of focus. Better is the Ruscico edition, but it has a very high contrast boost, losing much detail into the blacks. Best is the French Bach DVD, having excellent grayscale detail but only has the original French intertitles and no English subtitles.There is a custom DVD to be found free online which uses the Bach image and has new English intertitles, a soundtrack of Philip Glass music, and subtitles in eight languages. Search for: Aelita Oyarsa-Q.It is a very interesting film. Most people seem to miss the fact that all the scenes on Mars take place in an escapist fantasy in the mind of Los, who is prone to flights of fancy and daydreaming.In the final scene there is the message that the problems on Earth should be solved before governments spend large sums on space exploration."
3,Vignetting a major problem,"This is a good filter for the money, and gives good results if you're not shooting toward an extremely light background. But it creates serious vignetting if you shoot toward a light background, such as a tree against the sky, or snow-capped peaks in the distance. The resulting dark vignette is so extreme that you can't eliminate it with PhotoShop--you can reduce it, but it's still visible, and if you go farther you will start to create a light vignette at the corners of your image."
4,"Good Filter, wish it was perfect","I bought this to shoot surfing, many times I am shooting nearly into the sun or atleast intoa huge reflection, this works fairly good at cutting the glare, my only issue and who know why this happened but mine had a slight micro flaw in the glass, couldn't get it of with a microcloth, but I needed it so i kept it and dealt with it..."
4,It works...,"It's a polarizing filter. It does what it is supposed to do. Pretty good quality, too. Using it at wide angles will cause vignetting.Pretty expensive."
3,Vignetting on Tamron 17-50mm,Polarizing effect works as advertised. It does cause significant vignetting when used on a tamron 17-50mm on an a700. May work better for telephoto lenses.
4,Seems good but a little dark,"I've had this on my Nikon 18-200mm for a few weeks now, and really like it. It truly brings out great colors in the photos. However, it's much darker than I would like for a polarizer. This, combined with the aperature of the 18-200, has resulted in some blurry photos for me (especially indoors when ambient light is crucial). That is mostly my fault for being too lazy to take it off, pero ni modo."
3,Tiffen 58mm CP polarizer,One thing I notice is that it is kind of stiff to rotate the polarizer element of the filter. This easily makes your camera goes out of focus when trying to take a picture.
4,Polarizer,"Helps reduce the solar glare off water, shooting directly into the sun and allows me to take water fall shots without have me to use a longer shutter to create that smooth stream water fall effect when not using a tripodThough I not see a huge difference when turning the circular polarizer, but it does work well and is made from glass and not plastic"
3,Meh,I really can't tell the difference between the $7 filters and the $90 filters. So I guess it wiil be ok.
2,COLOUR ISSUE,"I should have stuck with what I know works, bought it took it all the way to australia just to find out that it makes everything VERY VERY dark and leaves wierd streaks on your images1!!!"
2,"Works, but causes flare","This item is either not coated or has a single coating and thus any time sun hits the filter, it produces flare in the picture. Furthermore, after doing more research it turns out that these uncoated or single coated filters can cause up to 9% light loss vs multi-coated filters like Hoya S-HMC or B+W MRC filters. As for polarizer effect itself, I think it's amazing and you owe it to yourself to at least try it on a nice sunny day. (the sky and foliage will look completely different and alive)"
1,Not even close...,"I bought one and am very disappointed with it. My older filter on a film camera gave a very nice dark blue sky on almost every single shot I took. This filter does not give the same quality, nor the dark sky effect I hoped for on my EOS 30D DSLR. Extremely disappointed."
2,Disappointed,When the filter arrived it was clear that it was not factory fresh. The package was not sealed and there was a fingerprint on the glass. I didn't bother to return it because after cleaning the glass it seemed to work properly.
2,Bad quality,I received a used filter with some dirty marks on it which I can't clean it. Really disappointed with what I received so I returned it.
5,Why pay more??,"Tiffen filters are great for the price. The circular polarizer turns drab midday skies to beautiful blue. You will not be disappointed. You can certainly pay more for a polarizer, but why?"
1,"Says Circular Polarizer, but is not","This appears to be just a ND filter in a polarizer ring. I have tried several ""tests"" (Viewing LCD screen and turning, looking through polarized sunglasses and turning, looking to the sky 90 degrees from the sun and turning. Nothing changes. A cheapo CPL for a smaller lens darkens and changes the polarization. I though tiffen was supposed to be a top notch company, but guess not."
2,Not good on a Lumix FZ35,"The Panasonic Lumix FZ35 has a really nice Leica super-zoom lens that opens to very wide angle - great feature, very useful. When this filter is mounted on the lens (it screws onto the end) the four corners of the frame show the edges of the filter. All four corners are black. Once you zoom in a bit this goes away, but it's annoying. I don't know if this is a problem with the filter or the lens but I'm disappointed."
3,"Decent, Not Bad At All","The Tiffen has been getting some pretty great results, but it's no B+W. The contruction doesn't feel as solid as I would prefer and it's not as dramatic of a polarizer as I'm used to. Would I reccommend it? Sure! It's not a bad filter by any means. It has taken some great shots, no distortion, but it's certainly not top of the line."
2,spend the extra few dollars for a better filter,"i bought this filter for the price, but was very disappointed when i used it. it does not attach well to my canon t1i. it seems like the threading is not really a fit. it fell off my lens once already. it came in a packaging that makes it hard to tell if this filter has previously been returned. there was a lot of dust on the filter and when i called adorama (the seller) about it, they said that it's ""not a dust free environment"" so they just told me to ""blow"" off the dust. in hind sight, i would much have rather spent $10 extra dollars to get the hoya filter that had much better reviews."
3,so so,"does the job though not as dramatic of change as other cpl's i have had. use it on my sigma 17-70, and with adapter on the canon 70-200f4."
5,Great Filter,A typical Tiffen product. Great filter with good quality glass. Nothing beats a polarizer used properly on a blue sky day. Superb for minimizing reflections and adding punch to your pictures. Every photographer should have this one filter in their camera bag.
2,Delivery,"Although delighted to see my package arrive, was disappointed to see that the filter case is opened up, spotted some scratches on the filter itself =("
4,works as advertised,"doesn't always remove all glare, but almost always removes at least some glare. plus it protects the lense all for decent price."
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"It's optically clear and effective. The only thing about it (and I figure all screw on polarizers would do this) is that if you are not careful about which way you rotate it, you may unscrew it and have it fall off. Yikes! Just be mindful of this problem and you'll be fine."
5,Polarizer great,"As described, works well. Delivered quickly. Lens rotates to let you choose where you want the polarization effect. A must for every photo kit."
4,Works great,"Seems like it is well made and decent glass. Pictures look great. Plastic case is a handy flip open style, but wonder if it will stand up to use. Seems ok so far."
4,Excellent Filter,Filter: Its a great filter and working as expected.Seller: Fast shipping and items were packed well.I recommend this filter to anyone who wants to try on CPL.
4,Performimg as expected!,Just received & tested ASAP: photos taken with and without CPL filter. For my camera Canon Powershot SX40HS I strongly recommend the 52-58 step-up adapter the bayonet style not the threaded one (I purchased and tested both): It's easy and faster to install/remove. Once fixed the CPL on the 52-58 step-up adapter I'll leave them together always. This will prevent thread cuts and misalignmentsCPL usage - It makes the difference even I was expecting a little bit more cutting of the reflexions but for the money spent it's very good. Tested at 90 degres (as all indicate) vs sunlight direction and the stones are visible in the pond due to reflexions cut at water surface. As you increase the angle the more effective it is: it's doing the job! At the beginning you need a little experience till you find the max open and max closed positions (CPL ring rotation) then you play with the ring for effects. I'm looking forward to enjoy this CPL filter furthermore for better pictures.
5,Works,Nice filter.. Isn't too extreme with effect but works great. I use it all the time. Just make sure you compensate for exposure.
3,Filter threads do work with Canon lens caps,"On my 30D, the lens caps do fit this filter, but they don't catch very much of the thread (maybe 1 or 2 threads). This isn't a problem, but if this filter was on my lens ALL the time I might not like the fact that it doesn't fit all the way to the bottom.Other than that, this filter seems to be a good value."
3,Fits but Dirty,"This polarizing filter fits fine on the 55mm lenses of my Sony Alpha camera. However, when I first removed the filter from the case it was very dirty. I don't expect to start out by having to clean a camera accessory before it can be used. I'm in doubt about this having been a factory sealed item."
2,its OK for the price...,Very poor build quality... my ring was shaking/rattling... and its extremely prone to attracting dust... gives u decent amount of contrast... probably u get what u pay for i guess....apart from that the biggest problem was the treads are too tight and rough... was a pain putting it on and getting it off my lens...but as i said its really really affordable and give u fair amount of contrast in ur pics... just wish build quality was a bit better.
2,Review,I am not particularly happy with this CPL. It is unable to handle flares if the sun is atleast 45degrees to the lens and there is some sunlight on the filter. My previous filters did not have this problem. Have to be really very careful when using this filter otherwise it would ruin your shot.
4,Great value a bit harsh on photos,"As a first time owner of Polarizer Filter i have to admit that this one is a bit harsher on the photos than what I saw on the shots by pros. But with it photos during day and around the water are much more contrasted. Contstruction is solid, however the top thread is a bit shallow to allow for Canon original cap to fit snug. You have to make sure its on tight or it will fall off."
3,Tiffen 67mm Circular Polarizer,"This filter has been entirely satisfactory in performance during picture taking. The threads in the mounting ring were a little bit fussy the first few times the filter was mounted, but the price was so good that I cannot complain. I would recommend that product to anyone who has L series Canon lenses and requires or enjoys the effects of polarizaton."
1,Excellent but...,"This filter is well made and the rotation of the polarizing element is smooth and flawless, however, while it ""fits"" on the Tamron 200>500 zoom lens I purchased it for, it does not allow the lens hood to be attached and so should not be sold for that lens. I was able to return it for full credit and purchased the Sigma AF11960 EX DG 86mm polarizing filter instead and that filter fits and allows the lens hood to be attached. Note that the Tamron lens has its own filter ring rotation element."
1,better off with ebay...,"Was this a 72mm circular polarizer? : YesWas it new? : NoWas it priced as used? : NoIs it worth it to pay for shipping to return it? : NoDo they count on that? : I'm sureDoes it appear to work? : YesIs it scratched? : NoDid I use 4 sheets of cleaning paper trying to make it usable? : YesWas it packed well? : No, it was loose in the boxWill I buy the rest of my filters somewhere else? : YES!!!"
1,junk,The 1st time I used it it got stuck on the lens and was impossible to get it off. I ended up dropping the camera and breaking the bottom plate of the camera. This was the most expensive filter I ever bought.
1,"assembled backwards, ad nauseam","Save your money. Had seen others write that filter was assembled backwards and other flaws. They were right.Cheaply designed and made. Get a Heliopan from Adorama, you'll be very pleased."
1,Barely does anything,This polarizer just darkens - barely polarizes. I tried using it with a blue ocean and cloudy sky and it did not enhance like other polarizers i have bought. Save your money and buy a better one.
3,"Not the greatest thing out there, but works.","I have been using this filter with my Canon Rebel XTi and 17-85 mm USM IS lens. My expectations have been ruined. I expected to see bluish shade when photographing the sky. This did not happen.The things that worked for me were:1> Sun reflecting on the snow.2> Sun reflecting on a water-body.In both these cases, the filter made a difference, (i couldn't call it remarkable).Overall I would rate this filter a two and half out of five."
4,I can't tell if it works or not,"A friend told me to get a circular polarizing filter for my canon lens so the sky here (which is always blue) would pop if there were any clouds. I needed a protective filter anyway so thought I'd try it. I really cannot tell the difference when I move the lens as to the difference in polarization. But, it is a protector for my nice canon lens, even though it is a bit too expensive than just a plain polarizer lens,for just that purpose."
1,Horrible Packing,"The filter was shipped in an open plastic box, no plastic bag to wrap the filter. The filter was quite dirty when it came. Bought 3 Tiffen filters and all three are like this.Still thinking whether I should return this."
4,Really Helpful For Skies and Water,"I use the circular polarizer extensively for landscape shots. In fact, I leave it on my lens (Canon EF-S 17-85mm) instead of a UV filter because I use it so much.Pros:- good value.- darkens skies, controls glare on wet surfaces, makes colors pop.Cons:- vignetting at widest focal length (but then again, you shouldn't use it at the widest end due to uneven darkening of skies at widest angle).- doesn't play nice with cokin filter holder (spins when you screw on the filter holder, can be annoying to have to reset it).Overall, this is a good deal for a filter that will really help your photos look better."
3,"Gets The Job Done, Does Not Come in Perfect Condition","I paid $23.40 for this filter, and I have also ordered several other of their filters. They get the job done, but they arrive in TERRIBLE condition. They always come covered in dust and somtimes small smudges -- not what you expect from a new product. However, a compressed air to blow off the dust and 100% ethanol with lens paper cleans them up nicely. This item does not turn smoothly to adjust the polarization."
3,"It works fine, but don't expect too much.","This CPL comes in good condition, and does what it should do. The only disappointment for me is that the rotation part is a bit loose. And I don't know if it is coated, probably not for a $20-ish filter."
5,Haven't used yet,"I haven't had the opportunity to use it yet. I took it out of the package, attached to lens and sighted through it. It seems to be perfect."
4,Works as expected,"Haven't had enough time to really use it much, but from what i cant tell it meets my expectations, as I had one before, just like it (just different size)."
2,You get what you paid,Not see polarization with LCD screen or polarized sun glasses. (Other brand and other size can definitely see when rotate ring) which means there is no meaning to rotate the ring. Can only use as protect glass or maybe a step down
3,OK filter,"This polarizing filter seems a bit on the week side.When aiming it at LCD screens, I can not get it to black them out completely."
4,Its a good polarizer,"Its a real good polarizer. Tiffen 55 mm circular polarizer fits well on my Tamron 90 mm Macro. It cuts the reflection very well and this is useful during macro photography. I would have loved to attach a ""multi-coated"" polarizer, but this does its job quite well."
5,amazing insights,Thoroughly enjoyable and easy flowing reading even for a layman .. I was particularly interested in the offset technology transfer model and private sector issues concerning globalisation.. Excellent stuff for those interested in Saudi in a serious manner .
3,A Couple great boobs,"Laurie Wood & Shannon Long's breasts are reason enough to check it out.Tawni Cable was always one of my favorites so if you don't have her video centerfold, she's also a good one to check out.Overall only average but it has it's moments."
4,Good product for the price,"I have a 1000 square foot medical office and needed an alarm for when patients entered the front door. The door chime sounds nice and sounds off about 99% of the time. The unit is relatively easy to install, but the volume is rather loud and does not really lower much. Otherwise, it is a great product for the price and I would recommend it."
2,". It is ONLY an entrance sensor, not a doorbell","This item is NOT a doorbell or ringer, where people at your front door push a button to summon you. It is ONLY an entrance alarm/charm, for use in businesses to alert when a customer enters a shop!In the picture, the middle sized item is a sensor/transmitter which you mount on the doorjam and the small one is a magnet, which you mount on the door. When the door opens and they separate, the chime sounds from the large item, which you plug into andescription used the term ""doorbell"" several times, this is not a DoorBell."
1,Do not purchase!,"I am very disappointed with this product. It should work up to 100-foot range, but it doesn't even work in 50-foot range. Do not buy it, you'll be very disappointed!"
1,Beware this is not a doorbell,I read the description of this product and ordered it thinking that it was a doorbell and also a sensor. It is not a doorbell and Amazon should change the written material about this product. It is not what I wanted at all. Unfortunately I did not read the customer reviews; if I had I would have noted that another buyer made the same mistake.
1,Very disappointed!,"This product worked great for about the first 5 times the door was opened, then it stopped. The lights show that the battery is working properly, but will not chime. The company is a pain to deal with. I have called several times this morning and was on hold for 20 minutes at a time until the line goes dead. I call customer service and they put me through again to Tech. support and get the same treatment. Put on hold until their line goes dead. I'm very frustrated. Product is going back."
2,Sporadic chimes,"We purchased this door chime for our office front door to alert us when someone walks in. We installed it according to the directions. It worked great for the first two weeks. now it's chiming is sporadic and sometimes doesn't go off. The red light still activates when the door opens, but the chime doesn't always go off. I'm not very impressed, but then again, the chime was inexpensive. Needless to say, we are going to take it down and purchase a better one..."
4,Works well,"DThe device itself works as advertised. The double sided tape that came with it was junk, but once the sensor had fallen off the door the first time and I replaced it with good tape, it's worked well. I did have to play with the jumpers so as to only have it going off when it should (crosstalk with another device in the area)."
4,Works great! No one can come into the shop without me hearing them!,I found the product easy to install. Hope it lasts a few years like the first one I bought did.
3,Has quirks after a while,"After a while, it starts chiming out of the blue. Checked both the door unit and the one in the wall, and both are operational. Still works when someone opens the door, but the ""ghost"" chimes can get annoying, but overall, worth the price and very handy when we can't see someone walk in the front door of the office."
1,does not last long when heavily used,used in a restaurant and they die after 6 months and u have to get new batteries. THey do not stick well to a door if it has a lot of temperature changes and are just built cheaply. Range is not what it says it is.
2,Range not great.,"Bought this to replace a cheaper version that had lasted 3 years, but died unexpectedly. Says the range is 100ft, but we're having problems at about 55 ft that we did not have with the cheaper version. If I hadn't destroyed the packaging I would consider returning this. For now, it will do.Edit: Bought basically the same thing at Lowes under the ""Utilitech"" brand. Works great."
3,Good for SMALL business.,I purchased 2 of these for our seperate stores. I imstalled the first on and noticed that distance might be an issue. I relocated the receiver and it worked for this location.The second location is slightly larger. It would not work at the required distance for me.If you have a metal door and more than 50ft of distance from the transmitter and the receiver this will not work for you.
4,Nice chime - but volume doesn't work,The chime is perfect if you wish to plug-in away from the door - but the volume adjust doesn't work. Seems to have just a single setting. But it works fine for our office where we have the sensor on the main door and the chime plugged in the back lab where we can hear it through the back office.
3,Would be great if it always worked,"I use this for a door chime for when customers come into my store. It is well designed, easy to install, has nice features. The only problem is, it only chimes about 3/4 of the time. The transmitter light goes on every time the door is opened, but the receiver only responds 3/4 of the time. I haven't been able to figure out why. I haven't measured the distance but it's not excessively far."
1,Works?,The item shipped quickly and worked well for one week then would not sound tone unless receiver was within 25 feet of sender.
1,you get what you pay for,"NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE. that is to say, attaching it to an aluminum frame door, as most commercial doors are, renders this POS useless. that is what they're customer service told me was the reason it chimed for no reason, but does not chime when the door is opened. useless!!"
4,Exit door monitor,"I had purchased this door monitor because my youngest son kept getting up at night and had the run of the house all night long. Since we have gotten the monitor, he has never come out of his bedroom at night, even to go to the bathroom. So it is definitely working as a deterant. Installing the equipment was easy. The only issue I have is that there is a 2-3 second delay between the time that the door is open and the time that the chime sounds. Since the speaker and the door are only about 20 feet apart, I am not sure why this is. Anyway, my son is finally getting the rest he needs for school and I am not worrying about the house burning down every night. Much better!"
2,Don't buy it,"This is definite;y a case where I got what I payed for. The entry alarm only works reliablly if the receiver is less than 10 feet away. The chime has a pause of 3-4 secounds before sound, which ends up scaring people because they are already in the room. Despite having the volume control turned all the way down, it is still very loud which once again scares people.Don't buy this its a piece of junk."
2,set up not as easy as it should be,"It took me several hours of trial and error, first moving the sensor location on the door and then changing the location of the chime, to finally find a location where the chime would work, even though every location I tried was not more than 30 feet from the sensor.There are two walls separating the sensor from the chime and once I got the chime located properly, it has worked just fine. It was frustrating and I almost sent it back"
3,Entry chime--NOT A DOORBELL!,"I should have paid heed to another warning that this product is NOT a doorbell, and now I am stuck with a entry alert that is worthless to me. I read the comment but for some reason I believed another commenter who claimed it WAS a doorbell; he must have made the same mistake I did: After looking at about a dozen products and having several in my cart at one point, it was hard to keep track of what was a doorbell vs. an entry chime. It is probably a great product if you actually are shopping for a entry-alert sensor (good for those backdoors where you have a pool). I liked the wireless feature and the fact that you can move the chime around by just plugging into another wall outlet. I thought about using it anyway, but my husband doesn't want to screw the sensor and transmitter into the door and doorjam. We will probably donate it to goodwill."
4,Good Product,Easy to install and works well. Volume control could have a bit more range. It's still quite loud even on the lowest setting. Solved that by taping some bubble wrap over the speaker. Otherwise a great system.
4,Alarm,Works OK - but if there is a heavy wall in the way - it does not work - Mine had a stairway in the way and it would not work - but as soon as I moved it to a hallway it worked fine
2,Wireless Motion Sensor,"The company was great - shipped very quickly, good pricing, good follow up. However, the chime uses a LOT of batteries and goes through them within 10-15 chimes. Great company, sub-par product."
1,A Bust: Heath Zenith Wireless Entry Alert Chime SL-6168,"Tried for 20 minutes to get it to work on the door. Never happened. Only holding it in the hand would the sensor work. The distance claimed for sensitivity is not true. Beyond 30 feet in a straight line of sight it never worked. I do not recommend anything that is so hard to install, even if it were to work."
3,Transmitter has grown weaker in strength.,"The plug-in part of the alert system was originally plugged in a perfect spot in the office where everyone could hear the chime. A couple months in, we noticed that the chime no longer worked. I checked the battery first, but it was discovered that in order for the alert chime to sound, we had to move the plug-in part to a different part of the office, further away from those who need to hear it. Turning it up just makes it absurdly loud for anyone who happens to be in the room when it goes off."
1,Disappointed,When I got the productr I was really excited. It worked for about 10 mins then stopped working completly. I am very disappointed with it.
2,Zenith Door Alarm - not-so-epic FAIL,"Bought the transmitter and two receiver units. All were very simple to install and worked perfectly for about two weeks, after which they began to work intermittently. Sometimes one receiver will activate, sometimes both and sometimes neither.I haven't decided whether it is better to have them running, working only approximately every third time, or whether I would prefer not to have them at all...http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HE6QXY/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
3,Won't work on metal door,Bought this for an office door which is mostly glass but with metal trim and this alarm will not work. Am going to try and work around this but wish it was stated prominently that it wouldn't work on metal.
2,Very loud & does not work at 100 ft,"I should have listened to the other bad reviews for this one, but thought we'd give it a try. First of all, the 100 ft distance is wrong. It worked at close to that, but only when it wanted to it seemed. Definitely doesn't register at 100 ft. The other main issue we had with this was it was way too loud, and the button to adjust volume was broken. We had bought a 2nd chime, so we tried that one and even at the lowest volume, it was still way too loud. We wanted this for our office, and there is no way anyone in our office would deal with this loud dinging every time the door opened. Why you couldn't adjust it to a quieter setting is beyond me-but this thing only has a couple settings Extremely Loud and then Moderately Loud! Even if we had gotten the volume setting somehow worked out or it had a quieter setting, the distance was still a big issue for us. We couldn't place it in a spot that worked for us since you could only take it maybe 50-70 feet from the door."
5,Exactly what I expected...,"Extremely happy with it. My only complaint is the volume adjuster on the sound box doesn't do anything. In order to make it a little quieter, I had to tape gauze over it."
2,Only worked intermittently,"We installed this on a metal door of a retail establishment. Apparently the metal interferes with the radio frequency. We were told to put small pieces of wood between the door and the unit, but it still only chimed about 90% of the time."

1,"Poor Writing, Inept Editing Mar Work","A book of extremely unprofessional conception, design, and execution. Amateurish in extreme. Future editions--if any--must feature heavy revision. However, it is, in fact, a superb model for how *NOT* to publish a book."
3,"Just OK, nothing special","These sandals look cool. They are pretty uncomfortable at first, but after you break them in they're not too bad. The one big problem is that because of the ventilator soles that provide air to pass through also let water pass through. So, if it's dry out they're fine, but any water will get your foot wet and I didn't like that."
4,Decent,"Before this, I used a Spalding brand slipper and decided to try this because of the ventilation holes in the design.Pros:-Ventilation holes help a little, but it's still a rubbery/foamy texture that may cause sweating.-Color is accurate. What you see in the pictures is what you get.-Heel has a gel insert for extra cushioning.Cons:-Color is accurate. What you see in the pictures is what you get.-Kind of squeaky on hard/clean surfaces.It's a decent slipper overall. I normally wear a 12.5 or 13 in shoes and slippers tend to run a bit large (such is the burden of manly men), so I bought a 12 and it was a bit tight, but adjusting the velcro strap solved the problem. I recommend buying your normal shoe size."
1,ABSOLUTE JUNK!!!!,"WOW, tried to buy this item last year and it was out of stock! Wish it had been this year. The adsyou see are totally fabricated crap!!! My house is dark in color, wouldn't you think it would providea great background for white snowflakes? NO! The light is very weak can barely see the image on the house in total darkness. In the yard overnight -- in the dumpster today. What a waste of $$$."
1,Don't Bother!,"This product does not work as advertised. It wouldn't project on our house, and it wouldn't even project clearly on the garage door. I have serious doubts that it would project on a closet door in a pitch black room. This was a HUGE disappoinment and a waste of our time. Pitiful. I contacted the seller twice to return it and they haven't even responded. I've had to file a claim with Amazon."
2,Worked great... until it failed,"I used this for two years outdoors at Christmas. Worked perfectly. Then it failed and it's irreparable.What failed was the motor that made the mirror ball rotate. The projector still works fine, but only projects a static image. What really annoys me is this was designed with the motor -- a small electrical motor that could easily be replaced for a few dollars -- SEALED INSIDE the mirror ball. I had to cut open the ball to get to the motor and, well, let's just say that putting Humpty Dumpty back together again is child's play compared to reassembling a mirror ball.A little forethought in the design could have avoided this. Motors wear out -- just like bulbs do. First year engineering stuff: put fallible components where they can be replaced. But, they didn't -- so a bad design ruined a product that, otherwise, I really thought was fantastic.Read the reviews and you'll find most users have had this motor problem after a while.

1,Avoid this product,"Waste of time and money. We only have a few christmas lights out front which is why we wanted to try the EZ Up light show. But it isn't bright enough, nor crisp enough. The image they show with the snow flakes is clearly faked and I have a good mind to call the state attorney because of that. The field of projection is much less for vertical displays like the snowflake so to cover a regular size house you need 2 or 3 of these.It is EZ to set up and thankfully it is EZ to take apart because this is going back."
1,Not all parts were shipped,"This looks like great fun, but not when all the parts to assemble the projector are not shipped. After shipping the price tag is $87.39 and I'm pretty upset that for this price I now have to go through the hassle of sending it back and waiting for another to ship (and hope all parts are included in it) or going to the hardware store in the hopes of finding pieces that will work to hold it together. Not impressed..."
1,Plastic junk,This is made from plastic where you hold the arm accross.It will break and bye bye projector.I sent it back before projecting but I bet it is awful!
3,simplistic,"This product was delivered on time, and was in the condition as described. I bought this book for my husband (history buff). Didn't really hold his interest. Was looking for something with more depth."
3,Odd,"If you like odd quirky science fiction, you'll like this. I like Farmer's ""River World"" books better, but this is a refreshing break from that series."
4,A good player if you have prerecorded MDs,"Pros: light; inexpensive; well-placed buttons are protected from scrapes by the protruding battery area; has a socket for headphone-cord remote (if you have one from another sony cd/md player).Cons: doesn't play MDs recorded in LP2 or LP4 format; battery life (33hrs) isn't as long as pricier players; opening mechanism is somewhat flimsy plastic.Overall I like this player, particularly for its great price and clean appearance. The battery life is long enough to hear 28 discs, so it shouldn't be a problem! I bought it for my mom to take on a trip and she had no problems with it."
5,A fitting tribute to a great man!,"The author, Jim McGrath, has compiled a well-edited look at the life of the former President. Readers who want a ""behind the scenes"" look of life in the White House without all the needless commentary should purchase this book immediately!! This is a must read for anyone interested in political life."
4,A Unique Pespective on a Most Important Year,"""Time Capsule/ 1942"" records the events of that pivotal year when the tide of battle turned in World War II, as seen by the editors of Time as it happened, week by week. It was the year of sinkings of merchant ships within sight of the U.S. mainland, surrender in the Philippines, and Operation Torch, the landings in North Africa. Meanwhile Japanese Americans were relocated away from coastal areas, Rep. Lyndon Johnson went into a combat area and returned to report to President Roosevelt, the Coconut Grove Fire killed 484 patrons, White Christmas became a hit and the St. Louis Cardinals won the World Series. Other books have the advantage of hindsight, but the Time Capsule series gives us the first hand reports of how events were viewed at the time. For that it provides a unique perspective of a most important year."
3,Needs to be longer,"This program needed to be a mini-series rather than a one hour program. There were too many historic and scientific facts crammed into too little time. As a result much of the excitement and passion of astronomy was left out. The bigger questions, such as ""How did the Universe Begin?"", ""How will it end"", and ""Is there life in other places in the Universe"" were quickly skimmed over or not discussed at all.If I wanted to inspire someone's interest in science and the Universe I think the PBS series ""The Astronomers"" would be a much better choice in spite of it being rather dated."
2,Wood glue failed immediately - you might try a different version of this toy,"A perfectly fine Soma cube (bit small but whatever), but the wood glue has failed so far on two of the pieces (has been played with for about 30 minutes total since opening it). The pieces were being handled gently by myself and by a septuagenarian. Have re-glued them with proper carpenter's wood glue. Apparently the glue the manufacturer uses is no good."
1,PERFECTLY HORRIBLE HORROR,"According to the IMDB this movie is the first one specifically made for PC downloading...it shows. Without any creative vision at all; horrible lighting, acting and editing and a confusing, muddled storyline, INCUBUS is everthing a bad horror movie should be. Tedious. Stupid. And just not worth it, folks."
1,It's bad in a very bad way.,"I try very much to be openminded when it comes to horror movies, but this? It's so bad my eyes started to hurt, bad idea and very bad acting.It's so bad I barried it deep deep down in my garden so no man could ever reach it again."
4,Underrated movie with a few reasons,"I considered this movie kinda underrated,cause in terms of acting,it was ok, well more than ok, scenes convincing at times too. But being a low budget movie,of course is gonna have a lot of dialogue & less action & places where it could developed in a very well done movie & scenario. I think that it's been criticized cause the movies entirely takes place in a hidden lab & a little bit of out doors view. But all in all it's a good movie, not excellent & thrilling but very good."
1,BOOOOOOOO!,"this movie sucked really bad. its not weird, its not scary, the acting is terrible, and the plot is really dumb. dont waste your time on this, i really wish i hadnt"
2,No talent,"Tara Reid has no talent. She's just an actress mainly because of her looks just like Jessica Alba, Paris Hilton, Carmen Electra, & Pamela Anderson. These girls aren't really actors at all."
3,Very causal writing style,"This book contains a lot of information on how to operate Photoshop to achieve the desired results but at the same time I think the authors had include a lot of unrelated or unnecessary texts to fill the pages. For example, it takes two pages of text to illustrate how to create a layer set and how to move the layers."
3,Not as advanced as I hoped it to be !,"I read all the reviews about this book and was sure I hit gold - but This is a very big book with very little to offer in tricks and knowledge. The best example would be the lack of any important info regarding Layer Sets - I searched the book and found that it does not tell you how to avoid the effect adjustments layers ,when applied to nested layers, have on the external layers below them (the answer is to avoid the pass through blending mode which is not even mentioned in the book).All I know about PS is from FREE video tutorials you may find on the net and some written ones. Save the money and get some Pizza."
1,Simply awful,"This book was simply awful. While I am very computer literate, I was completely new to photoshop 7 (and to photo-type software in general). This book decided to start by throwing me into the deep end of the pool and hoping that I could swim. I couldn't.Not only were the explanations completely unclear, they make you do exercises without telling you why your're doing them; you can't learn when to take a specific series of actions if you don't understand when/why they would be appropriate.Finally, the index was completely useless, at least to a beginner (perhaps if I had used prior versions it would have been more useful).Overall, I found this book to be completely worthless. It's been sitting on my shelf gathering dust since about a week after I bought it (which was how long I tried to muddle my way through it). There MUST be better books on the subject out there. Try one. Any of them!"
5,Beauty cream,So happy to finally find this again on Amazon. My mother loves this great refreshing scent.I also order this beautiful scent for myself. it's gorgeous.
1,Just so you know,"The reorganized church that the author of this book is talking about isn't The Church Of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. It's a church that branched off of the LDS(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints). Just so you don't confuse the 2 churches. A few, I know @ least 2 churches-the reorganized and the flds(the fundamentalist)that have taken the LDS religion and changed it to the way they wanted it to be. They are in no way affiliated with the LDS church. The teachings are not the same and their doctrines are not to be confused with the doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The others are merely sad branched off churches that people always seem to confuse with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints."
2,Cheap Truck,"I bought this truck for my 2 year old. He ends up crying everytime he tries to play with it. The sides of the truck do not stay on no matter how I try to secure them. He gets very frustrated when the sides fall off.The boxes in the back are cheap cardboard and not durable at all.The sounds the truck makes are very short. The box indicates there is a demo mode, on mode and reset. There are only a demo mode and reset.My son has fun playing with the truck and keeps coming back to it but tears ensue every time. I expected with a name like Tonka it would be a little more durable and child friendly."
4,A regular UV filter at a Great Price.,"This is the first time I purchased a product by Tiffen. I'm using this UV Protection filter mainly for the protection of my new lens, and I assume most people purchase a UV filter for the same reason. The main drive for me to choose this product is because of the reduced price and the 10-year warranty. Being a simple UV filter, there aren't any extra effects except the advertised ""Helps eliminate bluish cast in images."" My prints just came back, and I can't really see too much of a difference with my untrained eyes."
1,Fundamental problem,"I bought this filter for a canon 17 55 wide angle lens. I suppose it serves its function and protects the lens, but the overriding problem is that it doesn't allow for the lens cap to seal. The lens cap can barely be secured to the filter and will fall off repeatedly."
1,Bad purchase,This filter came in a bundle and is just good for protecting lense front element. I start using my lens with filter and was wondering why all images are bit soft looking. After several weeks I realized to remove this filter and softness was gone. I don't recommend this product to anyone.
4,Cover Up,This was a Christmas present for my niece as she has just purchased a Canon XS camera with an 18-55mm lens and didn't have a UV protection filter for it. I told her it was best to cover up so you don't take the chance on messing up the lens.I do feel she is pleased with this purchase.
4,Good for Price. Fits nicely on Panasonic FZ35,"I primarily wanted something to protect the lens on my FZ35, since it's a super-zoom and if I scratch the lens, the thing is trash. I haven't noticed the issues that other reviewers have, but they wouldn't surprise me. The thing costs $7. If the filter causes problems in any of my shots, I can always take it off. So far, in daylight and indoor (with and without flash) I haven't had any problems. The shots look the same as if the filter wasn't there. Exactly what I wanted.Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35 12.1MP Digital Camera with 18x POWER Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD"
3,No good with bright point light sources,"I bought this filter for protection of my lens, but it's only really useful in even light. When there are bright single point light sources, such as hanging lights indoors, candles, spotlights in a dark room etc, green spots or flares are cast across the picture; usually in very unfortunate ways like on a subject's face. I do a lot of hand-held low-light photography where there is likely to be point light sources, this filter is more of a hinderance in those circumstances."
1,Horrible,I received this filter as a freebee on a lens that I bought. I went out on a sunset shoot at the beach and was getting tons of internal reflections. Bad filter.
5,good filter,"The filter was as promised, and we are happy with it. Really, there's not much more I can say about a UV filter!"
2,Internal Reflections,"This filter is fine for normal shooting, but if you do low-light work, beware; you will see bad internal reflections on night shots, and will need to remove the filter."
2,Don't use in low light,"Took the suggestion of Amazon and bought this filter for the Canon 50mm f1.8 since the price was cheap. I will never make the mistake of buying a cheap filter again. Unlike other filters I have, the threads were not very good and had trouble getting the filter on the lens. When it was on, don't shoot in low light because it will ruin every photo. I have these green glowing spots on each shot, the internal reflection is not acceptable even on a $75 lens. Sorry Tiffen, I'm going back to Hoya, haven't had this problem on other lenses with their filters.Next time I will take the advice of amazon but look for better quality items. Live and learn, at least it was only $10 I am out cause it will be too much work to try and return it."
1,Poorly constructed filter,"Much has been said about how poorly this lens performs since it is not multi-coated, but that is the least of its problems. The lens I received is very poorly constructed. The glass does not sit tightly within the metal frame; it moves and rattles around. I would never install this on a lens a care about, and I certainly will never consider another Tiffen filter. Fortunately, I did not pay for this filter (it was free with a new Canon lens) and thanks to the reviews I had the good sense to order a more expensive mutli-coated filter at the time I bought my lens. I'll keep this one around in case I ever want to try some type of 'risky' shot where I'm likely to end up damaging the filter."
4,Perfect for Micro 4/3 cameras like the Olympus E-P1,"This is one of those ""must gets"" if you cherish your Micro 4/3 lens. Sadly, on the Olympus E-P1 it sticks out a bit, not really annoying, but since the 14-42mm lens on the E-P1 retracts so nicely, you'll immediately notice that the lens isn't as compact as it used to be.Still, better to have a small filter sticking out than damage your $300 lens.Quality of the filter is fine, but then again, there isn't much you can mess up on a UV filter."
3,"useful protection, but arrived dirty",Got it for a week. Fast shipping. It arrived dirty: smears on glasses. I have to clean it first. It then works fine and seems to be a useful protection.
5,Just what I expected!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Just what I expected!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Nicely priced and got it quick! Always recommend amazon! I use these for mostly lens protectors!
5,UV protector for Canon lens,Great price for this item. Works well with my wife's canon digital EOS camera.
3,So-so,"The only thing this filter is good for is protecting the lens from physical damage (dust, prints, scratches, water spots, etc.) Some say that cheap Tiffen filters degrade the quality of the images, but I haven't noticed any degradation. If you want a filter that will actually improve your images, do not get this filter, go with a circular polarizer or a neutral density filter instead. It's better to crack this filter than crack your lens."
4,UV Protection Filter does it's job,Ordered this filter from Amazon after I bought my camera. Wish I had purchased it when I bought my lens. The nice thing about a filter is you can worry more about taking pictures and less about protecting your lens. Good price and no noticeable picture degradation when using this filter. Just used this filter in Hawaii and it protected my lens from the salty sea air near the beach. Definitely recommend getting a cleaning kit to accompany the filter.
5,Dependable,"Tiffen filters, can be looked through with confindence.Tiffen, has set the industries standards for quialty.So, when YOU, take out that new lens from the box, hold it in one hand and with the other hand screw-on your new Tiffen protective filter.It's worth it."
5,LENS PROTECTION,"Fast delivery and great price. Does what's it supposed to do, which is mainly protect the lens. Great UV filter as well, although most buy this product for lens protection."
3,"Good protection for lens, but horrible for photography.",I bought this filter to protect my lens on my GF3. The filter will provide great protection for your lens but photographs will be negatively affected with this filter. Shooting into a light source at an angle will affect your pictures. This filter is priced really good but it I was looking for and hoping for something different. The filter also came very dirty with smudges and finger prints.
5,Good price - good product,I got this filter at a reduced price when I bought a lens. Excellent product. Better than excellent price!
5,Perfect!,"Very happy with the purchase of my new Tiffen UV Protection Filter.I've had it now for a few weeks, and I'm very happy with the quality ofpictures using this filter."
5,Good filter,"I'm not a pro (yet) and I can't compare it to all kins of great filters, but it looks nice and clear and it protects my lens. So, I'm happy with it. I've used Tiffen filters on my other lenses before and never had any issues with them. Not to mention, the Amazon price was great, better than eBay."
3,Decent for the price,"The main purpose I bought this lens filter to be honest, was to protect my glass. And it does just that. For the price, you can't beat it. Now, comparing this filter to the likes of B+W or even some of the higher-end Hoya, well, its no where near as good. But ultimately it all depends on your budget and weighing the pro's & con's. It does what its supposed to. Reduces UV light and protects your actual lens from scratches or worse, potential cracks/shattered glass if you drop it (not that this filter will save your lens from a 40 foot fall, but you get what i'm saying).Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase and once I upgrade to say, some ""L"" type lens, at that time I'll invest in a B+W. But for my kit lens, this Tiffen does the job just fine. And you can't beat the price."
2,used 62mm UV filter,"Performs as intended. That is after I spent a lot of time cleaning it. I will add that the filter wasn't scratched, just dirty w/water spots."
5,"If you own a DSLR, you need this!","If you have a DSLR camera, you really need this! It doubles nicely as a lens protector in the event you happen to forget you lens cap! I don't know a whole lot about DSLR cameras, but I can tell you from a protection standpoint of the lens, it is 100% worth it!"
1,Do NOT buy this,"As others have stated on here, these are NOT coated, and WILL cause light reflections on your images. I ruined several great shots because of this filter. I just returned it, and will just spend real money on a B+W multi-coated filter. If you are just getting this as a lens protector, I'd recommend a lens hood instead."
5,does its intended job,"Purchased this item along with Sony Sal 70-400 lens, it fits perfectly. and it was delivered on schedule."
2,OK for Free,"For an inexpensive filter (free with the lens I bought) it is fine. lots of ghosting as you might expect for an uncoated filter. I have removed it and do not plan on using it again.On my bigger glass I tend to use 77mm multi-coated filters which run in the ~$100+ range. I may purchase a 58mm coasted version of this filter for ~$40 (or about 10% of the cost of the lens I would be putting it on).However, with the 50mm f1.4 I tend to shoot in low light with light sources in the frame. No filter will generally be my choice for these situations."
2,Does what was expected of it,( Tiffen 67mm UV Protection Filter ) I knew it would cause reflection of lit-up areas of my picture composition and thats what its doing so i cannot blame it. I ordered another better filter for quite an expensive lens of mine alongside this one which was multicoated. From this filter you should only expect dust protection and that's it. That's enough for its cost
3,"Decent filter, mine had a flaw in it though.",You get what you pay for.... if you want quality you may want to consider paying a bit more.
4,Always check for right size,"This uv filter works fine- on my Sony a100! The Panasonic DMC 30FZ I bought it for on the accessories part of amazon recommended it and it is not the right size for that.I guess everyone but me knows to double check the small accessories that amazon says go with a unit. Taught me to be more careful, at least, when I'm buying adapters, batteries, etc, have not had a problem since.By the way, it's a good quality filter!"
5,Lens protector,Great choice for everyday use: protects your lens from scratches and almost doesn't impact the image colors
3,reflection,"I use it with my canon 50mm 1.4 , and i see a lot of reflection...don't know why...but for the rest, I am happy"
5,Keep your lenses safe!,"While on a day trip last summer to Mt. St. Helen's, I asked my husband to run back to the car and grab something out of my camera bag. Unfortunately, the bag was left unzipped. He came over, holding my lens, telling me that he had broken it. I took it from him and looked...it was not broken. The UV filter had taken the brunt of the impact, shattering, but saving my lens! Never leave your lenses unprotected!"
3,Needed it right away!,"Received filter and it worked fine. Was leaving for trip and had to have it. However, looked as if it had been used."
3,"Fine product, great value, but too thick to stack with others","Good built quality, greate price, work fine by itself, but it is too thick to stack with other filters without getting dark corners :)"
5,great,"this lens works great, it does nothing! just what it is supposed to, and no more dust will get on my lens"
2,Is this a Tiffen filter?,"purchased this one as spare filter for lens, not happy for the problems, anyway, you get what you paid.1st problem, the light would be reduced 20~30% after this filter was attached, and another hoya filter will not reduce any noticeable light; 2nd, the lens cover cannot insert to the filter deep enough, as the original lens or hoya filter."
5,good product at a good price,"I'm not an avid photographer, but this filter is great for the price. It's also a great way to protect your lenses. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to protect their investment and get good uv filtering."
2,You get what you pay,This is a very cheap piece of glass and to top it I got a copy that is loose with no foam pad & folded catalog in the case. I think I got a returned item. Add $10 more and get a better filter.
5,It is a good filter,"I will begin by saying I am not a professional photographer.I bought this to protect my Canon 18-135mm 3.5-5.6f lens. It arrived in fine condition, and was very easy to attach.I have noticed no abnormalities in image quality, and it's perfectly fine (and cheap enough) for my purposes."
3,Portable Guy's return policy,"Can anybody tell me Portable Guy's return policy or how to contact them? I get nothing but a circular set of instructions that bounce me back and forth between PG and Amazon and a message ""Portable Guy has not specified their refund and returns policy"" --I am at thomach3@yahoo.com"
5,UV filter,"So far I've had my camera and this filter for about a month. I love the quality of my photo's, the filter seems to be doing a great job without interfering in the quality of my pictures. Easy to put on and easy to clean. So far very happy with it."
4,Tiffen 82mm uv filter,Great fit on the panasonic hvx200. Best uv filter on the market for the money. No lens distortion or anything of that nature. The only thing that makes this a 40 dollar filter is the fact that it's not dual coated to stop sun flare. For the money it's totally worth it to protect your several thousand dollar camera. Highly recommend Tiffen products.
2,Lens Flare,"There is a lot of lens flare with this glass..""You get what you pay for"" comes to mind with this one...It does work for the most part. it keeps your lens safe... :P"
1,Absolutely not what I expected!,"I had purchased this along with my 50mm f/1.8 mkII thinking that it would protect everything well and improve my photos. While it did do a good job protecting, everything thing else was horrible. First, with any picture I took that had a light source...that light source was reflected in green on the opposite side of my photo. Second, the filter got STUCK ON THE LENS. I had to have it professionally removed! If you don't mind the green reflection in your photos, then by all means purchase this. Otherwise...stay far away! It is not worth the $23."
4,Good for protecting,"I only use this filter to protect the lens on my camera. It does that well. Make sure you do not over-tighten the filter!I did see some horrible ghosting effects of the filter but it was only an issue in low light with long exposures and bright subjects like neon signs. The light goes through the filter, reflects off of the sensor, off of the back of the filter and back into the sensor causing a double ""mirrored"" image (based off of what I read). People seem to make a big deal of this where I would simply say remove it.All in all if your lens doesn't have a lens hood, use it just for a longer lens lifespan."
5,Perfect fit for my 18-55mm lens,"Worked perfectly, was easy to screw on. Doesn't even feel like an extension .. very thin and seamless coupling with the lens."
4,Works well,Fits Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens and Zeikos ZE-LH52 52mm Soft Rubber Lens Hood (Black) very well. Product as described.
3,Does the job,"I'm not sure if it's only the filter that I received, but mine arrived with dust on both sides of the glass and the glass was not sitting tight in the ring, it's loose, slightly moves.But it does the job now, so I don't think that I'll return it."
1,not so well built.,"I bought this product knowing it will protect my lens but i discovered that it will damage it so I returned it. I have a wide angle tokina that i just purchased along with the said filter, when i placed it to the lens it touches the glass when zoomed at 24 mm.No ill feelings but just disapointed."
3,cheap but is it worth it?,"the glass (as other say) is like used, it is dirty with some dust inside. i have to wash it with water and dry it. but still its not too clear. the package doesnt even have a cleaning cloth or foam inside it."
2,Invest your money in a better filter,"If all you need is filter to protect your lens and you primarily shoot in the shade without any light sources, then this is the filter for you. I personally will be returning this filter and have already invested in a B+W coated filter which is significantly better. The Tiffen lens produced way too much ghosting and flaring with even the slightest hint of sunlight. The B+W lens worked perfectly, and all of my images came out beautifully. So the moral of the story is if you've got a decent lens and want to produce the best possible images, invest your money in a better filter. It really does make a big difference!"
3,New?,"What can you say about a filter. What are your expectations - that it be threaded metal and clear glass. They got the threaded metal part perfect, the clear glass part is a different story. The filter had a definite used appearance to it. There were finger prints on the glass, the case was dirty, the foam inside the case wasn't entirely in the case.Having worked in a camera store, I know that things go in and out of their boxes so that people can try them for fit, etc. Usually they are restored to new condition before they are put away.After a careful cleaning, I felt comfortable installing it on my new $1,000.00 lens. It now meets my expectations."
5,It saved my lens,"I bought this to protect my actual lens and it paid huge dividends. Not sure how it happened but I took the camera out of the camera bag and the protection filter was cracked like a spider web. Fotunately, the lens underneath it didn't have a scratch on it. If I hadn't spent the little bit of money on the lens filter, I would have been looking a costly repair of a $1500 lens."
3,Tiffen 46mm UV Protection Filter,Serves as a cheap lens protector. Noticed a slight glass chip on the edge. Not a problem but that's why I gave a 3/5 rating. Optically it is fine and serves its purpose.
1,"Defective item, but seller chose to ship",I returned the item within 5 minutes after I opened the box. It's such a defect item that the glass is almost falling off from the unit. This is a very very poor quality product. It's obvious that neither the manufacture nor the seller (in this case amazon.com)cares about their brand and reputation. I'm very disappointed in amazon.com.
2,Tiffen UV filter,"This item arrived loose in the outer box (out of it's factory box). It appears to have a number of manufacturing defects either in the coating or in the glass itself. These appear as tiny ""bubbles"" or ""pits"" as you view light through the filter. Amazon is sending a replacement, but it will be 6 to 8 weeks before it is available. Overall, not a great experience."
3,You get what you pay for,"I am comparing this with an multi-coated UV filter that is twice the price, and the difference is evident. This is not a bad filter by any means, but if you have a good lens, you owe it to yourself to get a better filter - you'll see the difference."
1,Worthless,"This filter is not coated, and the reflections are awful. It wasn't worth returning it, so I use it as a lens cap and take it off to shoot pictures. I got a Hoya coated filter and it was well worth the extra money."
2,Poor Quality - Replaced Immediately,"I ordered the Tiffen 58mm UV filter to use on a Nikon 50mm f1.4G. It didn't look all that bad, but I immediately noticed increased flare and degraded sharpness in my pictures. It required a filter wrench to remove it from the lens because the mount is very soft and threads not quite machined right. After I removed the filter, the glass was rattling loose in the ring. It is now in the trash bin. I purchased the B+W 58mm UVA (Ultra Violet) Haze MRC Filter #010 to replace it."
3,No difference noticed when using this filter,"Generally speaking, you should probably only buy this filter if you're concerned about your glass getting scratched or damaged and would rather a cheap filter take the brunt of the abuse. Consider using a lens hood instead to add protection to your lens and reducing flare, or if you're worried that the filter will give you unwanted reflections."
3,"Adequate & functional, but disappointing.","I ordered two of these filters for new lenses I was ordering at the same time. When I began to attach the first filter I thought there was something wrong as it would not tighten at first. I discovered that the threads on the filter were minimal, almost seemed worn. The second filter actually rattled. The glass is mounted in the filter so poorly that it actually rattles around in the holder. They both function but I feel the Hoya filters is what I will stay with from now on. I have always purchased Hoya's in the past and never had this type of issue before."
3,Look for better price or Use on Ebay,"I have the UV filter from this site before I didn't look on Ebay. Well, I would buy it from the Ebay, because you can get it reasonable price and better one. Of cause you need to study for Lens filter !!! It saves the money and your time."
4,great value filter,"the price was right to protect the front element of your lenses, will protect me from any damage caused by accident, Sturdy build.never buy a lens without a UV filter to go over it.!!!"
3,Glare monster!,This UV filter renders the Rokinon 85mm f/1.4 useless because of the noticeable glare it produces. I gave it away to my friend who uses it only for protection.
5,Very Useful and worth a buy.,"This protection filter fits my Cannon T3i lenses perfectly. The pics are not affected by attaching the filter, but it does protect my lens nicely against dust and water drops if any. Definitely a must buy for the costly lenses."
2,Bummed,"When it arrived, it was rattling. My other lens filters did not rattle. I put it on and it still rattles, and the lens cap can't fit properly into the filter. I'm quite disappointed in the product and will be purchasing a different brand of filter for my lens."
5,"GOOD, I GUESS!!","I AM SORRY THAT I CANNOT GIVE A PROFESIONAL REVIEW. IT IS HOWEVER A GOOD LENS PROTECTOR!!I DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL WHO WANT TO PROTECT THEIR LENS FROM SCRATCHES!Rom 5:6 Christ died for us at a time when we were helpless and sinful.Rom 5:7 No one is really willing to die for an honest person, though someone might be willing to die for a truly good person.Rom 5:8 But God showed how much he loved us by having Christ die for us, even though we were sinful."
2,Useless filter for shooting in most conditions,"I've got this filter as a free add-on for nikkor 35/1.8f lens. It can't handle any direct light, literally, any light (lamp, reflect from the lamp, etc). It has enormous reflects. Basically, it has the same optic properties as piece of regular glass. I wouldn't spend any penny on this item."
3,took a long time to recive,the product was good just took a really long time to receive this product thanks and I am looking for a 86mm one now
4,It's a Filter,I've had my Nikor 12 - 24 for about 8 years without a filter on the front. Simply never took the time to purchase one this size. A year ago I took a fall down a steep embankment and broke the sunshade that did provide protection for the lens (limited) When I ordered the replacement lens hood I added this filter. I haven't shot with it since I placed the filter on the lens so the jury is still out on that part.But the quality of the filter and ease of mounting it to the lens is what I want to see in a filter.
3,Value Purchase,The Tiffen UV filter is a good purchase for the cost of the lens. It threaded onto my lens quickly and I have no problems with it distorting my pictures.
5,Good timing and good product,The product came in the amount of time it was supposed to and it is in great shape! I have nothing to complain about.Very Satisfied
4,Great buy,"I bought this just to help protect the lens on my camera. It seems like it reduces the glare when I shoot pictures through a window. Great price, Great product."
5,Worth the Price!,"I bought this filter to protec my lenses, it well built so it do the job. also i notice tha my images show reduce in flares and uv noise, really. It's also easy to clean witch helps lot."
5,"It fits well, and the price is right.",This part is a great alternative to the more expensive Canon UV filter. It also fits well. I've had no problems.
3,a few scratches on one of the filter i brought.,"i bought 2 filter at the same time, one for me and the other for a friend. a few scratches on one of the filter, which i kept. the other one was great."
5,I love Tiffen brand...,"I had used it for quite a while and I love this brand. I'm not a professional but I'm looking for quality products in my budget. This is one of them, love it ..."
4,Good general-purpose UV filter,"Not much to say about this, it's a good general UV filter. No problems with it nor anything stellar to write, just nice protection for your lens."
4,Great product for the price,I bought this to protect my new lens for my Canon XSI. It works well and was a great price.
1,Don't waste your money on this,The plastic box is very clumsy. The crew is hardly fitted on my Canon and Sigma lenses. Don't waste your money on this.
1,broken,"The inside case was crashed while the outer box is perfect, so what's that mean??!! That means you know this item was broken and you still sent it to me, what's your problem??"
5,good value,"This filter fits well and very clear. I think I should've bought another one to protect my other lense, so I do not have to change every time."
1,RUINS STILL FLASH PICTURES ON PANASONIC TM900,"When taking still photos using the built in flash on the Panasonic TM900 video camera, reflection from the filter causes a bright smudge in the middle of the image."
5,Peace of mind at great price,Excellent compatibility with my camera (Sony NEX-5). Ordered immediately when I purchased my camera but couldn't find one in town (didn't use the camera until I had this filter in place). Considering cost of camera lenses this UV protection filter is a great investment in protection. Easy to clean between photo shoots. I would buy another Tiffen filter when I purchase a telephoto or wide angle lens.
2,Cracked!!!,"It's not the most clear glass, but it works. However, I bought it for the protection on my Canon 17-40mm lens. It always sounded a little loose and moved easily... then finally it CRACKED. I'm lucky it didn't scratch my new lens. I'm going for the B&W filters from now on. So much for savings, now I'm paying more than I would have if I just did it right the first time!"
5,Good filter....,"Ok, it;s a cheap one, but it;s very good.... i'm using with a AF-S 70-300mm VRII, no problems at all.... no vignetting at all.... ultra clear....."
3,Does the job of protecting the lens,"The first filter I received had scratches all over the rim so I returned it. The second one also had scratches, so I decided this was the average quality of this product even when new and kept it. It does the job of protecting the lens and keeping dust out so, given the price, I guess it's OK."
3,The loudest part on my camera,"I thought Tiffen was a quality company, but although the 46mm filter arrived packaged safely and securely, the glass rattles every time it's moved or touched.The lens I want it on is for sneaky photos, but there's no sneaking up with this rattletrap attached. It probably does everything else it's supposed to, but boy is it loud. Never thought a filter could do that.Tiffen 46mm UV Protection Filter"
4,Great for lens protection,I bought this primarily as an extra layer of protection for my lenses and have been pleased with the results. You simply screw the filter on to the lens and you've added a cheap layer of protection to the end of your lens. My small gripe is that if you're working in cold or humid conditions it WILL fog up considerably.
4,Excellent protection !!!,"Nice quality product , very clear crystal , never worry again about dust and finger prints on your lens.Excelent value for money."
2,not for night shots,"Great clarity and well made, however I clicked the add both to cart without really checking it out. I am always out shooting at night and this filter does nothing to reduce lens flare, it may even amplify it. Sending it back."
3,You get what you pay for.,This is ok....it was free. but you get what you pay for and the next 2 protective lens's I bought were more expensive and much better quality.
3,Spend some money and get a multi-layered filter,"I bought one of these (on another account) to protect a pancake kit lens. People differ on using filters to protect lenses. Some like hoods, some like nothing at all, and some like uv filters (or clear ones). If you shoot a photo into the light/sun, you will get flares with this filter, and any cheap single layered filter. You can, of course, unscrew the filter off of the end of the lens when you are shooting into the sun, but this is a lot to expect. Spend the extra $60 dollars and get a multilayered filter (hoya pro1 is an example). You will still get some flare but it won't be NEARLY as much."
1,Can't Use it with Lens,"I know there are a few other reviews that talk about this filter creating spots on the lens. I concur with those reviews. I've used this with my 35mm prime lens, and have gotten to the point where I just take it off before shooting, as most of my shots would come out with a green spot/tint. I still keep it on for when I carry the lens around just as added protection, but I doubt I'll even do that for long, as it gets tedious taking the filter on and off.I got this free with the lens, but even so I still feel a bit ripped off."
5,It's round!,"OK, It's a UV filter. I use it mainly as a piece of ""clear"" glass to protect the front element of a lens. What can you say about this one? It is round. The mounting is solid and a nice black color with legible lettering. The threads are accurately cut and it easiy screws in and out without getting stuck or coming loose. The middle part is transparent so you can take pictures through it. It looks to be of a uniform density, with neither darker nor lighter areas. All in all, it is everything anyone could ever want in a UV filter. The single negative thing I saw was that it is inexpensive. If you get a charge of telling everyone how expensive your camera and ancillary equipment are, forget this filter."
5,Great price! No complaints. Cheap insurance and more!,"The UV filter is used by most of us as simply protection for our expensive lenses. It is the primary reason I bought this filter, and at this pricing, it's unbeatable. It fits nicely on the business end of my Nikkor 17-200mm VR lens, with absolutely no issues on focus, clarity or even the lens cap.But I discovered that it's a bit more than that, and this filter actually works as designed in blocking UV light. Add that to the price and fit, and this filter gets my highest recommendation."
1,wrong information,"I bought this because Amazon suggested together with my Xacti 1000, however it was the wrong size which needs an adaptor plus another lens cap. So I had to return it and buy a correct one.I understand it was an automated system that Amazon provides according to the orders, but consumers must be very careful as well. I was in a rush and try to be hustle free."
1,I'm getting a lot of reflections on this filter,I was trying to take some pictures of my son close to the Christmas tree and I was getting a lot of reflections from the Christmas lights on this filter. I had to remove it. I'm looking for another one. I don't know if they will all do this. I hope not. I wouldn't buy this unit.
4,what can you say about a filter...,"good product. feets my needs (amateur photographer). maybe not the greatest filter, but good value for the cheap price you pay."
3,It works,"So it works... just not what I was expecting out of it from the reviews of you know.... subtracting glare so I can take photos of water, glass, and other reflective objects. IT DOES however prevent my camera lens from being cracked."
3,a cheap cover for your lens,"If you want more serious UV protector, then go for MC.But, it's cheap and protects the lens from dirt and possible damage."
4,"Returned shattered glass back, but second is great","Packaging of first filter was a very simple thin cardboard box, like a cigarette case, with plastic bag full of glass shards.They kindly replaced the item, quickly and in better packaging, and it works great!"
1,"A low quality filter, the price tells everything","I never bought a Tiffen filter before, and I will never do that in future. I got a 58 mm UV filter for free with a lens purchase, where I bought a B&W filter as well (34 $), and I tell you that I realized the differences immediately when I looked at them. The Tiffen glass looks like a normal window glass rather than a camera filter glass. The glass fits the ring, but the cut was very much uneven. The filter glass was not even clean, I would need to clean it first if I am going to use it. Well, I will certainly not do that..."
3,OK,This Uv Protection filter works well to protect your lens but does not shoot well at night while directed at light.If you buy this knowing that it is not UV protection coated then its an ok buy. (I didn't know that it was UV protection coated so i feel like i didn't get moneys worth)If you have 10 extra bucks just buy a better quality one.
3,I didn't look on Ebay,"I have the UV filter from this site before I didn't look on Ebay. Well, I would buy it from the Ebay, because you can get it reasonable price and better one. Of cause you need to study for Lens filter !!! It saves the money and your time."
1,Does not fit the Panasonic camera,Doesn't fit the Panasonic HDC-SD1 DV camera. Despite the vendor says. They did accept return but charged me shipping. Get it rigth Panasonic
1,Ghosting and cheap build quality,"For anyone that gives a crap about their photos I would recommend staying away from this product. Its (at the moment) 6 dollars and I made the mistake of purchasing this based on all the ""good reviews"". Read the bad ones because its true. This lens has artifacts like mad when you look close. taking a photo of people near christmas lights? Forget about it! I can post process but its pretty rediculous. Its also broken after two months use with no idea how it cracked an no one else even using the camera. When the Hoya or B&W lenses are 2 to 6 times as much there is likely a reason. I wished I wasnt cheap the first time around."
2,"cheap, but no use","this comes free if you buy a nikon lens, but as many customers said, it has very bad flares when shooting next lights. so not much useful."
1,Horrible internal reflections,"Only thing I like about this filter is that, I got it with my Nikon 50mm lens for free. It is unusable in conditions where there is light in-front or towards the sides causing horrible reflections on my images. I am glad I did not spend $9.99 to buy this filter."
4,It's a must,"For everyday use, this filter will protect you camera against scratches and increase your lens's life."
1,"You get what you pay for - a cheap, low quality filter.","I picked this up with a music order for my 350d - big mistake. The class came chipped, scratched and smuged; Tiffen filters are of very poor quality.Do yourself a favor, like I did, and find your local camera supply store and pick up an optical grade filter for maybe, oh, 10 dollars more. This Tiffen one was so bad that the scratches made their way onto some shots and ruined an entire day of shooting."
5,Great low cost filter for the Canon 50mm 1.4,"Wanted to get something at the same time as I bought my 50mm 1.4 on Amazon, this one was perfect, nice slim filter and works perfectly. Didnt need a $100 filter here."
3,It's okay for the price.,"Up front: This filter is cheap cheap cheap. It came in a cheap case and was dusty and smudged.It fits my 60D very nicely and looks great. It protects the lens well and keeps out dust like a champ however, it will occasionally create reflections and sun spots in my pictures. I use a lens hood and I took the same shots without the filter to test. The reflections are only there when using the filter. Please keep in mind that I am not a professional photographer. I do not use the protection filter any more unless I am climbing over rocks, etc... I think I will most likely end up saving and buying the Canon one. It is very expensive but reliable.I hope this helps."
2,"Protects lens, but blurs photos","I got this as a cheapo lens protector - with some UV filtering as a supposed bonus. I liked it - until I just got back from a trip shooting wildlife on my Canon 70-300mm f/4-5.6. All the images with that lens were slightly blurred. Those I focused manually, those that auto-focused, wide-open or stopped-down. Slow or fast shutter, even on a tripod. All detail was blurred.I got home to shoot some test photos, and I found that when I took this filter off, images were perfectly sharp. Look at the fencepost comparison photo I included in the images. All settings are the same between the two shots, just the one on the right is with the Tiffen 58mm UV filter, and the one on the left is without.FYI - I also have a BW 77mm F-Pro MRC UV filter that I tried on that same lens with an adapter, and the images were crystal clear. Tiffen is going in the trash and I'm buying a different brand."
1,never buy this junk!!!,"I am so angry! I put this on my brand new D90, only to find it pressing the end element of my lens in the center. I was scared and remove it quickly. The film coating the lens element was damaged by this filter!!!! Tomorrow I will make a phone call to amazon for a compensation. crying for my D90 lens...."
2,Not compatible with my Canon lens,"I'm sure this filter is a great purchase for the money for other lenses. However, when I attached it to my Canon 17-85mm, the Tiffen filter touched the lens glass. Bummer. Wasn't sure what to rate it as I wasn't able to see it's capabilities as a filter, but I wanted to make sure other buyers with my particular Canon lens were aware that this filter is not the right choice. Amazon was great with the return."
4,A decent and sturdy filter,"I got this filter for use with myCanon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Camerasand have been fairly satisfied with it. I am not sure how much of UV protection this filter gets - my primary purpose was to get something that protects my lens under the everyday working conditions. The built of the filter feels very solid and I trust it to get the protection job done. I use the zoom lens primarily outdoors in non-direct natural light, so I have not experienced any of the light reflection problems that other reviewers have had."
1,You get what you pay for,The build quality is terrible! The glass is loose inside the ring and has lots of imperfections. Completely useless.
4,It's a good filter,"As with all of the filters I have purchased from Tiffen, Nikon or B+W it fit the need. Nothing to get overly excited about but also nothing to get chafed about. It seems to be a quality product."
4,Does what it should for DAYTIME shooting,"This is inexpensive UV cover lens mostly for protection of the actual lens glass itself. As for nighttime shots I did see ghosting and doubles of light reflections. For me if I am doing night shots it just comes off. I also have more expensive ones which when shopping you can read the description which advices of you of the coating and glass type of which will NOT have ghosting, but it will cost 2-3-4 times as much. If you take loads of night shots or indoor party shots I suggest buying the better glass or having extra lenses. I have both so I am covered and understand that photography in general is not a cheap hobby or profession when it comes to equipment."
2,Mixed results,"I have had one of these filters on my Nikon 18-70mm DX lens for a couple of years and had no trouble with it. So I let Amazon add one to my order when I bought the Nikon 70-300 f/4.5-5.6 VR lens. The filter ruins the performance of the 70-300 VR, the lens doesn't focus correctly and there are strange reflection patterns in the out-of-focus areas of the image when you zoom in to 100%."
3,Good Backup UV Protection,"This came free when I purchasedNikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Camerasfrom Amazon. It did not have the best reviews so I purchased aSigma DG 52mm Multi-Coated UV Filterto go on the lens primarily.I have put this on the lens a few times to see what I thought and it definitely reflects light when its coming from a shallow angle more, leading to more flares and ghosts. I plan to keep this as a backup for the Sigma filter in case I break or horribly scratch that one, itll work in a bind.I would not recommend buying this filter - spend a few more dollars and get one that wont end up annoying you when you look at the pictures."
1,Do NOT buy this UV filter from Amazon,"Just when you think that you are getting a ""brand new"" filter from Amazon as they specify, think again. The filter came with several finger prints, specks of dirt, and obvious signs of wear. The metal threads on the filter had abrasions and chips as well as on the outer edges of the filter ring. Several people on online photography message boards have reported the same issue. I sent the filter back and purchased it from another company."
5,Excellent filter - great price ! Must have for FZ18 users!,I purchased this filter through Amazon/Adorama for my FZ18k - primarily to protect the front element of the zoom lens. The filter was delivered in it's own case and the packaging is much better than many other brands that I have used in the past. The quality of the glass is good. I have not noticed any distortions in photos takes with the filter. It is a great buy to protect your zoom lens!
2,"Inexpensive but watch out for reflections, ghosting","Generally these are only used for added lenses protection. The price of this one at 1/4 the cost of most seems a good deal but my personal experience with it has been mixed.Any image of a lighted subject taken at an angel usually casts a reflection and creates a ghost shadow on the image. It can range from nearly invisible when printed to quite noticeable if the background is dark. This may not affect general photography but the lettering in any lighted signs, etc. will sometimes show a reflection."
3,Quality product quality service,Nothing special about the filter. It's just your standard UV filter. Came packaged in a nice hard plastic case so was in great shape plus would be good for storing other filters. Service was prompt and I had no problems.
4,Nice Protective Filter,"I bought this for my Sony A300k's two lens. It did it's job: protect the lens from dust, finger prints and reflected some of the UV.For the price, what more can you expect?"
2,Decent for protection,"I bought it without doing much research. The filter isn't coated, so all of the wonderful coatings on your lens become almost pointless. I've since decided to go without filters for protection. I replace the lens cap immediately after use anyway."
2,Tiffen 67mm UV Protection Filter,"Nice lens, but the glass rattles too much within the frame and is really quite annoying."
5,Good protection for my DSLR,I have three lenses by far but I have only one filter before. I don't know how important it is to protect the lenses until I consulted with relative information. Then I bought two more and make every of my lenses to be protected.
5,Good product!,Good price and works as advertised. Definitely a good product to have and protect your lens.
5,Tiffen = Prophylactics for Lenses,"I have been using Tiffen products for some time now and I have never had a problem with any of them. I highly recommend this UV protection filter if you are planning on keeping your lens safe for years to come.During a visit to Chicago, IL a few weeks ago I had forgotten to replace my lens cap on my Canon 24-70mm EF-S Lens after taking some shots while riding the water taxi. When I got off and was walking around Navy Pier, I nailed the front of my lens on something and it scratched the filter to hell and back. It is easier (physically and financially) to replace the filter than it is to replace the glass in a $1300 lens."
2,Not a coated filter,"My experience with Tiffen has been mixed. Tiffen used to make quality filters, but since it was bought a few years ago by an outfit called Topspin they started cutting corners and quit multi-coating their filters, so like this UV filter, they will cause ghosting & reflections on your pictures. They protect your lens OK, but if your pix turn out bad, what's the point?"
2,Buy something better than this,I would like to return this product to amazon! It does not fit my lens properly and I have to exert force to make sure it fits on my lens.
2,Glare on images under some conditions,"I find that the filter works good under many conditions such as in natural light and indoors and it appears sturdy enough to protect my expensive lens. However, when I shot images of a burning fire in my fireplace, I got several glare spots on my photos. I shot the fire from several different angles and with different apertures and the glares never dis appeared. Finally, I removed the filter and got great shots with no glare or distortion. Had I read other reviews on this product before buying, I never would have purchased this filter."
3,Meh,"This filter lasted me a couple of years on my Tokina SD 11-16mm f2.8(IF) DX lens before the filter inexplicably incurred a chip right inside the frame. Not sure what caused it, but I am sure it wasn't caused by mishandling that I'm aware of. I treat my camera gear very gently."
5,Tiffen lens - great,The lens is great and the vendor sent it as advertised. Look forward to working with them again and again.
2,Not multicoated - can cause multiple reflections,1. Cheap2. OK for protecting lens when no bright light source in front3. Causes ghosting with bright light source (not multi coated)
5,Lens filter,"Needed to protect my lens at dirt track races, this did the job and the photos are great. Quick shipper as well! Thanks"
3,Cheap fix,Not Multi Coated and it affects picture quality for the worse in certain situations because of it. Buy a Hoya
4,UV Filter for Panasonic Lumix Camera,Purchased it primarily as a protection against abrasions of the lens on my new Panasonic Lumix DMC- FZ435 camera. Fit the camera fine. Received promptly and was the product advertised.
4,camera filter,Filter worked perfectly and was about a third of the of the cost of a similar one that JVC sells for the video camera I own.
5,camera filter,I have already received the filter and have used it on my Nikon camera. It arrived in a timely manner and I am happy with the purchase.
1,Get the real deal instead!,"It's just a UV filter - a piece of transparent glass, right? And Tiffen is a manufacturer of photographic equipment, so how bad could it be? Well, the price is low, and it probably is for a reason. You get what you pay for.No anti-reflective coating means you can see yourself in the lens, and when taking pictures against sunlight, you get fairly nasty lens flare. If that's what you're into, this is a great filter. But if you want a simple extra-layer to protect your valuable lens, but don't want any quality changes, Do not get this filter.I used original Nikon so far, and I do regret having tried to save some money by going with Tiffen.Same happened to the 52mm I bough - I guess it is a manufacturer issue."
1,Amazon promoting wrong item,"The seller shipped promptly. I do not have a problem with the seller. Unfortunately Amazon had recommended this as an accessory for the camera I bought, but it was not the correct size and I am unable to use it. It would cost more to return it than it is worth."
1,disappointing,This was a very disappointing purchase. The item was never received and I had no contact number for the company. This was a complete waste of my money.
2,Where has my lens been?,"I found the protective lens was covered with find dusts when I twristed on the 50mm lens. The root cause was there is no wrapping outside of the hard plastic case. As I contacted Amazon customer service, the options to me were to return-for-refund or to exchange."
2,"ok for the $$, but you get what you pay for","I was in LA and went to Simon's camera I wanted to buy a new Canon lens for my Canon 5D. Simon, the owner saw that I had this Tiffen 77mm filter on my camera and commented, that ""you've got great glass there (the lens), but the UV filter you are using is not so good."" He did a side by side comparison of the Tiffen next to the Hoya Pro1 Digital filter. It was really night and day. The reflection and glare & distoration were noticeable. I did replace the Tiffen with the Hoya ($79.99) and don't regret it. The Tiffen is fine, if you are on a budget, but if you want great results, don't skimp."
1,Read Gatorvalenz first - NOT FOR WIDE ANGLE,"I (foolishly) purchased this filter to place upon a Tokina 12 - 24 mm Nikon lens, exactly the same as Gatorvalenz, because I was too carried away with the 'buy me too....' approach engendered (and desired) by Amazon. That's fine, my mistake. It cost an additional USD 30 to buy a filter that would work effectively with the Tokina lens. As a side note (almost...) this filter comes with the WORST packaging I have ever seen. Fine if you buy from the store, but not so great (for me...) when the filter traverses 10 time zones via Fedex/UPS/Other Carrier of Your Choice. Luckily (and this was probably pure luck...) the filter was OK - but useless for the intended use!"
2,Had to return it.,I bought a lense on Amazon and it was recommended that this filter be purchased with it - unfortunatly it doesn't fit the lense- I requested a refund and Amazon refunded my money.
5,Great product,I bought two: one for each lens I own. Perfect fit and it does the job: protects the lens (I hope:).
4,"Cheap, but that is why I bought it","I bought this to have a cheap, protective filter for dusty/dirty outdoor environments on my telephoto lens as it is easier to clean than a multi-coated filter. I do not notice any difference in picture quality but being that this is not multi-coated it has the potential to pick up light and create flare/ghosting. I would recommend paying $20+ for a HMC Hoya filter if you want to avoid these issues but these are slightly tougher to clean as multi-coated anything picks up everything."
5,Does its job,"I bought this as a cheap way to protect myCanon EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS UD Standard Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras, and it does what its supposed to do. Fits securely and accepts the lens cap. I have not noticed any change in IQ."
5,Does what it is supposed to,"Fits well, protects the lens, doesnt distort the image quality. What else can you ask from this kind of filter?"
3,just ok,"I use this filter on my 100mm macro lens. Used strickly for protecting the glass lens, however im finding that it has a slight haze in one area that i cant get cleaned. Otherwise i still recommend anyone who wants to protect their investmest to buy this."
3,Tiffen 37 mm filter,"The item is as described .. it was promptly delivered and well packaged .. I just don't ""love"" Tiffen filters. This was handy, that's all."
2,Flare is bad,"This filter came with my Canon 70-200mm F/4 IS USM lens ""FREE"" from Amazon. First night I took few pictures of the moon.... guess what, the photo was not too bad but the flare was very bad like there were two moons. Well, what do you expect?..It was free! For the time being, I kept it attached to my lens as a protection. Will definitely buy another filter."
2,Not great,"Considering that some photos are unique and you only get the chance once in a lifetime, I recommned buying a better one. I bought this filter to protect my nikon. It does the basic job, but I get noticeably better photos with my better one. I guess the argument ranges over whether a filter to protect the lens or reduce glare is even a good idea, but I usually like to have one on, especially if I'm outdoors or in a dustry environment."
3,Excellent,"i am so glad with this item, i recommended a 100%, don't even think about it, buy it now, bye friends"
5,Cheaper than other filter,This is made in USA. Better than Japanese made HOYA filter in other camera lenses. I wish i knew better.
2,Imperfections with bad glare,"Construction of the filter is great with a metal ring that can protect your glass. However, the product produces a glare. As I found in the reviews below, this it is very apparent for everyone. I tried flipping the filter to see if it made a difference but it did not.Also, the filter I received has imperfections that are visible under direct light. They show up as shiny specks in the glass. No amount of cleaning would remove them.I'm returning this because the issues stated above render the product useless. Lesson learned, look at reviews first and like one user stated, ""look for Multi-coated."""
1,Blue ghosting and flare,"Don't waste your $10!! I'm not a prosumer even, but the blue ghosting/flare is very noticeable on half my photos! This cheap filter is useless, I can't see anyone using it for more than a couple of weeks. Go for the better multi-coated ones, I don't know which but I'm researching it right now."
3,you get what you pay for,"It's well made, but the lack of multi-coating means that you'll get some reflections on your images. It protects the lens though."
4,Good Filter for the Price,Pretty good filter for the price being offered. My criteria was to have the lens protected from dust and wear. Pretty much happy with this filter.
5,Tiffen UV filter,"This is what I was looking for. The package came faster than I expected, and was well-protected. I would definitely recommend this brand of filters."
2,It was free....,This filter creates tons of lens flare. Might leave it off my lens. Only got it cuz it was free with the lens I purchased. Might want to spend some extra dimes on a Multicoated UV Filter to reduce the lens flare when using filters.
1,Ghosting shots,"I'm not the first who telling you this, but you will get ghosting with this filter (take a look on add pictures)"
5,Tiffen 82mm filter good deal,"The price on Amazon is what makes this Tiffen 82mm filter a good deal. Most professional photographers were not pleased to learn that Canon had upped the diameter of its relatively new 16-35mm f2.8 lens to 82mm, which makes it incompatable with the mostly 77mm diameter L-series lenses in the Canon lineup in terms of filter use.Bottom line: Buy this product so that you protect the glass surface of your expensive lens, which will cost a heck of a lot more to replace than a filter."
1,Pana-View Transformer,"Video Camera Center held up notifing me they were canceling my order until the daybefore it was supposed to arrive. If it was out of stock, they should havenotified be immediately. This also messed up my postage rate on severalitems!"
1,TERRIBLE!,I bought this filter replacing a Hoya that I had accidentally scratched. I received the product quickly BUT with small nicks and scratches all over it! WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND! I'm very dissatisfied! I'm expecting a full refund ASAP!
1,Packaging is broken; doesn't fit 18 - 55mm lens,"The first time I ordered this, it arrived totally scratched because the packaging had come open. I ordered a replacement, and then the same thing happened... and I tried it on my Canon t31 kit lens that's 18 - 55mmm and it didn't fit even though I ordered the 55mm filter."
3,UV filter,"Works fine, except the thread pitch is a bit off and didn't quite match the Sony 50mm 2.8 Macro lens I bought it for. However it fits OK on the old 18-70 lens. Certainly not too expensive, anyhow."
3,"Works mostly, get some ghosting sometimes","As other reviewers have pointed out and posted pics about, this filter gives ghosting sometimes. I got it free with a 55-250 lens. At 250mm with this on, it was a terrible image. This worked great on my 18-55 though. It's nice to have to protect the lens but that's pretty much it unless you have a wide lens. Zoom lenses will hate you if you put this on. I don't have a nice filter to compare this to but I have another cheap one to compare it with that doesn't do the ghosting(Neewer). Overall I think it's an ok product for the price."
5,a must have for your lens,I learned a hard lesson not having this on my lenses to start with.take the time to get one you will not regret it
2,The low price shows in the performance,"I used this for a few weeks before I got tired of all the artifacts and glare present in my pictures. I should have bought a higher-quality UV Filter right off the bat. Oh well, live and learn..."
2,"Nice product, terrible packaging","I ordered this product from Amazon, and it was supplied by ""Amazing Deals Online"", I ordered it with two-day shipping as I have a trip coming up and wanted to be absolutely sure I'd get the filter on time. To the credit of UPS, the filter arrived one day after shipping, but it was a pretty badly mangled box, which is only part of the problem. Once I opened the box I found the plastic case popped open with the filter wedged pretty solidly in to the hinge, the plastic locking tabs perilously close to the glass. I had a hard time extricating it, it was definitely wedged, but it seems so far the filter is unscratched. It took significant cleaning to remove the dust and smudges, once I get through my trip this weekend I'll update my review with details on the filter's condition and photo quality."
4,good product,"Overall, it does what it's supposed to do. I'm not sure if the photo quality is better because of this filter though."
5,52mm UV Filter,After attaching the filter to my Canon Lens I felt secure knowing that the lens is now protected. Great Service!
3,Good filter but not great,"Pretty good filter, but not multi-coated so flares still evident. For basic pics this should work just fine. Fit on Lumix FZ-28 w/ no problem."
3,You get what you pay for,"A cheap filter that protects your lens and not a whole lot more. The glares are more prominent than with most multi-coated filters. If you can afford it, go for a multi-coated filter for your lens. Hoya/B+W are worth the extra money paid. When you're willing to pay hundreds for your lenses, why not add a fraction of the price to get a quality filter?I own a couple of these filters for emergencies but mostly packed away in boxes."
5,Tiffen UV Protection Filter,"Great, inexpensive filter. I have been shooting with this filter 100% of the time and I have great image quality through it."
3,Tiffen 52mm UV Protection Filter,The Tiffen glass looks fine. The glass in the metal ring however is loose and does not exude quality. Not sure about reflections with this filter and whether it has any antireflection coatings.Also purchased a Quantaray CP filter which I have been using and is great and a Hoya Neutral Density filter that screams precision.
1,These really just aren't good.,"I've read a ton on filters for protection of my lenses... Don't buy Tiffen, don't even buy Hoya... spend the money on B+W clear protector filters. They really don't mess up your images. The Tiffen filters pickup everything and add nasty ghosting to your images."
5,Practical,Good product. Very economical. Highly recommend having a UV filiter to protect your lens glass from damage. Tiffen filters are very good quality.
3,You get what you pay,"An average filter, the quality is not good, but it is cheap and for an emergency this could be a nice option.If you have a super fancy and expensive lens like the L series, dont buy this one, remember that the quality of your less will decrease to the worst quality of the glass you put on it."
3,Fits the Lumix DMC-GF3 (42mm lens),"I just received the filter, so I'll have to experiment with using it in different settings and types of light. But this model definitely fits the Lumix DMC-GF3 (42mm lens). In my experience, it is always a good idea to use a filter to protect a removable lens from scratches, dirt, or other damage. The price is definitely right!"
1,Adding my results to the din of 1000+ voices already heard on this filter,"Frankly, I'm surprised that this filter has so many positive reviews on Amazon. Maybe you can attach it to your lens and the extra glass will help prevent scratches and dings, but it's not going to improve your photographs.A more expensive filter, in the $50 range, will undoubtedly include better UV filtering that will really help you with spots or haze.If you have an expensive lens with fast glass, don't even *think* about this filter. This filter can easily take your paper thin glass down an entire f/stop. You'll need to look in the $100 filter range for optimal aperture operation with your lens.Bottom line - I would not recommend this filter to anyone!"
3,Protects your glass but shows some ghosting!,I have this on my 50mm. It does protect it and I feel Safe from dust particles. Biggest problem is that when i take photos with light source in the frame it shows some glare like windows do. It sometimes shows a upside down reflection of the closest light source. Please check out the image of where the lady is taking the photo in the living room. You see the lamp upside down in a reflection. That is from the filter.
2,Cheap filter = spots and relfections - get the B+W instead,"When I bought my camera I bought both a Tiffen and a B+W filter just in-case there was really a difference.I started noticing strange flares and reflections on some of my photos. Having seen comparison photos in other reviews of this product I decided to test. After extensive cleaning of the lens and filters, I put the camera on a tripod and swapped out the filters. The Tiffen created quite a few obvious spots and halos. At night it caused reflections. Without the filter it all went away. With the B+W I was able to produce some very small spots in the same situations, but nothing noticeable without pixel peeping. I plan to replace my Tiffen with a B+W even for my cheap kit lens."
2,"I love tiffen, and amazon service, but...","I bought this filter from amazon and they have great customer service! I thought the filter was the wrong size so I contacted them and was immediately sent a replacement.Now, it turns out it was technically the right size, but, horribleness occurred with his filter. As a freelance photographer for my town's newspaper, I am frequently shooting events and have damaged a lot of equipment doing so. I picked this filter because I thought it would protect the glass on my lens (which it should).I took this filter attached to my gear about two weeks after I bought it and went to work. Within five minutes, it fell off the front of my lens. Thinking I hadn't screwed it on tight enough, I reattached it and went on my way. Not two minutes later, it fell off again. Needless to say, this went on for the entire three hour assignment.The truth it, it sort of screws on, then just pops right off within just a few minutes of movement. Bummer."
2,check lens size,was sold together with the sigma lens 70-300mm and is the wrong size. be sure you know the diameter of the lens before you order.
4,Protect your camera lense,"This could save you hundreds of dollars, or in the case of a point and shoot, the need to replace the entire camera."
2,not as pictured,the metal ring is thicker than pictured . install it before the lens change the looking of the camera. optical quality is so so.
1,"Beware, be very, very careful",I received a genuine Tiffen 58mm filter plastic carrying box. And a piece of paper with the usual graphics. And... nothing else. Seems that the shipper likes to remove the filter and just ship the plastic box. How nice. My query to Amazon regarding the situation... netted nothing. No reply. Not even an acknowledgement. Zip.Beware.
1,Never got the item,"Never got my item, the packaging came but the actual filter was not there. What a waste of time and money!!!"
1,Broken filter,"I received this product with a crack down the center of the lens. Although the cost was minimal, the fact that the lens was broken is annoying. Is it replaceable?"
1,Terrible ghosting,"Ghosting on any light during low-light shooting. .. ie, candles, background lights... i have to remove this when shooting to avoid ghosting."
1,filter was terrible quality,"terrible product, the lens came and was loose, rattling, going to have to buy another one, different brand."
1,"Right lens, wrong camera",Sorry to say I was not aware I placed an order for the incorrect lens for my new Canon camera. So now I feel stuck with a product I may never use.Don't know where to turn now. Any help?
3,So Good,"the reason I bough this filter is only to protect my lens. I can not refused the discount, and then bought it. up to now, the glasses is so good"
1,Quality is very poor!,"Two problems with this UV filter. (1) The glass is loose. If you hold the filter ring and shake slightly, you'll hear a clicking sound. (2) There is a scratch in the black ring, showing silver colored inside material."
1,Adds reflections/artifacts to your photos,"I bought this filter for my cheap but awesome Canon 50mm f/1.8. I thought it would be silly to spend almost the same amount of money on a filter as I did on the lens, so I purchased this Tiffen filter.Horrible idea. After putting this filter on and taking pictures of anything bright, I have reflections/ghosts in my images. Take off the filter, and it's sharp and crystal clear.Needless to say, I'd take the risk of lens damage on my sub $100 lens than have shoddy images."
3,UV Filter for lens protection,"Tiffen has been in the filter business for as long as I can remember and they make a good product for the money. Their typical filter has better quality glass than most camera store off brand filters. Not nearly as good as a Nikon or Canon branded filter some of which are built by Tiffen but to a better specification using better coatings. All that said, if you are just looking for basic UV function or lens protection from the this filter it is just fine as long as you don't have an ultra wide angle zoom or ulta wide angle lens as this filter does vignette on my Nikon 12-24mm lens. There is a newer filter made especially for ultra wide angle lenses that has a reduced ring sidewall thickness. It is naturally priced at double the price of this filter (go figure huh?)."
1,watch out for tiffen filters,"There is an excellent scientific review on a polish website, Lenstips, testing 17 different UV filters, using both a spectrometer and photographic tests. This Tiffen filter is bottom of the 17 tested - it has virtually no impact on UV radiation and actually reduces light transmission by 3% on some wavelengths - not only is it a waste of money, it reduces image quality. On my Pentax lens, images tend to be over-exposed and of lower contrast. Draw your own conclusions."
1,Does NOT fit the Nikon 55-300 mm lens it is bundled with,"I ordered the Nikon 55-300mm f/4.5-5.6G ED VR AF-S DX Nikkor Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLR and this filter was grouped with the lens and SD card. It does not fit the lens and needed to be returned. It may be a fabulous lens, I was not able to try it."
2,Disappointed,"I got zeikos filters for two of my lenses, and I'm very disappointed. I get a green ghosting whenever there is bright sun, or if I'm shooting into a light. Indoors it's okay, and it will protect my lens, but I'm going to have to take it off any time I'm shooting outside, which is a hassle and a pain, and not worth the money. If you're looking for high quality images, do not get this filter. I'm going to buy the Hoya UV filter as soon as I get the chance, it's worth the extra money, and I regret cheaping out on this one."
2,Poor image quality yet cheap protection,"Thinking I was buying a quality UV filter and lens protector I soon realized it was more of a removable protector than a quality filter. Time after time, whenever I was shooting pictures with angled lighting, ghosting and flaring occurred so I found myself removing the filter. Yes, there are high quality digital compatible filters at 3x's the cost but they are worth every dollar more."
1,Well the product is Cheap,"We all know 77mm filter sizes are standard for the pro lenses and this one is a total misfit for such lenses. The filter screws in but the glass on it keeps dangling and makes clinging noises as if the glass is about to fall off, don't get fooled by the price like me, don't buy this product!"
1,Ruins Image Quality,"I threw it away. What a rip-off.All kinds of glare and reflections coming from this *very* cheap piece of glass. I had to re-shoot a lot of stuff because of my choice to use this filter. The amount of glare it picks up is ridiculous. It was my fault for buying it. I knew it had to be terrible at this price.If you have any doubt, buy one and find out for yourself.This product is 100% snake oil. Buy a good filter or use your lens cap if you want to protect your lens. Tiffen = Trash.I would rate it 0/5 if allowed.-Mike"
2,"Very poor quality, do not buy this (see below)","I purchased this filter from Amazon based on positive reviews I read here. The filter is very poorly made, I am shocked that so many rated this highly. Normally the reviews on Amazon are accurate indicators of quality. The glass in this filter is not fixed, in fact it doesn't fit properly. The glass moves back and forth in the casing,it is as though the filter housing was made for a much thicker piece of glass. As others have written it was also very dirty as though it had been handled. I'm guessing somebody else was unhappy and returned it.I have experience with Hoya filters and have always been pleased with their build quality. I have returned the Tiffen filter as of today and ordered the Hoya. I find the filters great for both the protection they provide and function they serve."
2,Hardly a UV Filter - Lens protector at most...,Read all the reviews and for $6 - I couldn't go wrong as an OUTDOOR lens protector. However it does have its flaws and based on some tests I've seen is USELESS as a UV blocker - less than .01% blocked. SO why buy this? Honestly if you want some weird results from your photos indoors or in low light situations - then this is for you. Otherwise avoid this simple lens protector.
5,Serious amateur,Good product as a protective cover for the lens. It does provide some color improvement and is much more economical than Canon branded UV filter. I am pleased with it.
3,Quality Control???,I purchased this filter and upon opening it found the glass rattled in the frame. Seems the factory had left out what ever secures the glass in the frame. Amazon agreed to replace it.Wish I had read the reviews on the glare before I purchased or I would have gotten the no-glare type.
2,Not that great?,"I've been taking shots with this filter on since the day I got it two months ago. I'm not very impressed with it. It doesn't seem to filter out any UV, and can easily cause problems with light reflections (because it's another pane of glass against the lens).If you need a UV filter, do yourself a favor and try the multicoated UV filter instead."
1,Not for me,"I bought this Tiffen 77mm UV Filter for my Canon 100-400mm IS lens. Since I got the lens I have not been getting the quality of shots I expected. Long story short, the problem was this filter. I took it off and instantly had the lens of my dreams. If you care about image quality you may want to reconsider."
4,Great Filter!,This is a very good filter. It has very good threads where some cheaper filters don't fit well. Tiffen obviously takes pride in their products.
2,It does its final purpose.,"The protector comes with kind of tiny spots on it. It does protect the lens from scratches and fingerprints, dust and other things."
1,UV LENS BOUGHT WITH 5 D MARK II,"THIS WAS ON THE SAME PAGE AS MY 5D MARK 1I AS SAYING ""CUSTOMERS WHO BOUGHT THIS CAMERA BOUGHT THIS"" AND SINCE I WANTED A UV FOR THE NEW CAMERA I CHECKED IT. IT WAS THE WRONG SIZE AND I WENT ON A FOUR WEEK TRIP WITHOUT PROTECTION FOR MY NEW 24-105 LENS. WHICH I LOOKED FOR ALONG THE TRIP BUT COULD NOT BE FOUND . I WAS STEAMED."
1,Poor customer service,"I have sent the message below 3 times. Why can't this problem be settled?I did not order the TIFFEN 58 UV, i.e., SKU# TF58UV, but it was sent to me and $12.39 was charged to my credit card. Please send me a prepaid mailer for returning this filter and reverse the charge on my credit card, and I will return this filter to you. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter."
1,Not good for consistent auto focus,"I bought this to protect my new Panasonic Lumix FZ100's lens. Wifey is not too careful when handling cameras (I hope she's not reading this). I wanted to prevent constantly cleaning fingerprints off the lens and the blame-game. When I took pics of some birds on a sunny day, the birds were slightly off focus in many pics even though the camera has a terrific AF capability. The pics did come out very nice except for the auto focus part.Indoors, in low light, the camera took a lot more time to autofocus than it usually does. Once the filter was removed, focusing was rapid. I think I'll buy some other brand."
2,Problems with Sun Spots,I'm going to have to invest in a higher quality UV Filter. I have problems with sun spots showing up on my photographs even with a lens hood in use.
4,Worth the investment,"This lens filter seems pretty standard, it is made of glass and feels like its good quality.It's always worth investing in one of these lens protectors instead of having to buy a new lens if something goes wrong.The case in which the lens protector comes doesn't seem to hold onto it very well. If I shook the package, I could see and hear the lens bouncing around.Other than that, it's a standard protection filter that is worth the overall investment."
5,Gotta get your UV filter!,"A UV filter is a must have for any lens in your camera bag. I've always been happy with the Tiffen products and this one does not dissapoint.Fits nice, easy to remove to clean and you basically don't know it's there unless you need to remove it."
3,Tiffen 46mm UV Filter,"The Tiffen 46mm UV Filter does its job, after I cleaned it upon delivery.The filter was delivered horribly dirty. Fingerprints, smudges and obvious dirt & dust were very visable on both sides of the lense. I don't know how it left the factory like that. Thankfully, the lense itself was not scratched."
1,Messed up indoor shots where there are bright signs,Please do not get this filter at all. Its not really worth the savings as the flaring effect is just too much to handle.I took a few shots in Pike Market at Seattle and the bright neon signs and yellow bulbs tend to reflect back from lens to filter back to lens. All my subjects had ugly green flares across their faces.It kinda killed the great 35mm f1.8 lens on my D90 results.I also noticed it always bounces the light source 180 degrees across the frame. Try to shoot a Subway sign framing it at the top right corner and you will get a reflected image of the sign on the bottom left corner.
5,Lens Protection,"This is an inexpensive way to protect your 35mm or digital lenses. High quality, no distortion, and additional filters can be added to this one."
3,Didn't fit my camera,I have the Cannon Rebel Ti and this didn't fit!!! I'm not sure why because the lens said it was 55mm...Other than that it seemed like good quality!
4,Good utility lens filter,Does exactly what I want; protect the lens. Quality enough for crystal clear pictures and inexpensive enough to replace immediately.
4,Filter UV (Made in American),This filter is American which made me happy! Presents a good quality and offers good performance. UV filter is essential to protect the camera (lens).
5,Nice one,"UV Filters are good, protect the lens very well. I have been using for couple of years. Photos look good. Definitely recommend this!"
5,Tiffen 72mm UV Protection Filter,"This filter is a replacement for a previous Tiffen 72mm filter that ""saved the life"" of a Nikon VR lens that was dropped during a recent shoot. I've always had good luck with Tiffen filters and will continue to purchase them in the future."
5,Price was right,Needed another article and this item added enough to make the shipping free. Well packaged and defect free.
1,Darned - there's a mark (scratch?),I'm sorry to have to return this filter - didn't even put it on the lens that I ordered with it.I noticed several marks all in a line near one outside edge - and couldn't clean them off. I assume it's a small scratch.So - I'm returning it (thanks to Amazon's easy process) and will re-order another brand of potentially higher quality.
1,Semi-opaque to UV Light,"I decided to try the filter in an old Beckman UV-VIS spectrophotometer, and replicate optical transmittance results in Poland. Sure enough, Tiffen and window glass appear to be optically related in transmittance of long-wave UV. Frankly, I've alays had the impression that Tiffen filtered images were less clear than B&W, and this kind of study may well explain the difference. Here's a link to the original study results [...]"
4,Good,Its been awhile since I made this purchase but it was helpful. I just wanted to write a review for you. Thank you.
3,"Protect your lens, but...","It's important to protect your lens from scratches and dust and such. It does that obviously well.But when held up against light, it leaves a horrible apparition. Ruined some of my photos with this streak of cyan. But for a cheap filter, this is your buy. For an actual filter, i would spring more money."
3,Dun expect much on this,It's is just a protection for your lens ... not more then that... better buy another filter that useful for outdoor taking picture.Not recommend
3,Could be better,"The filter itself is fine. But the package is horrible. It is not air tight and there is no plastic bag to protect the filter.So you can image how much dusts can get on it during shipping and handling. Actually, I had to clean the dusts on the filter by myself before I could use it!"
2,air bubble,"I ordered one for my E-PL1.Unfortunately, it had an air bubble close to the center. I'm not so sure about Tiffen quality control, but it's $9.95 so YGWYPF.Amazon credited me the $9.95 so I'll order another and hope. Twice bitten, I'll go with another brand.I'm in a photo shop dead zone and have no local purchase/inspection options. Though BB now sells the E-PL1, the local BB doesn't... and they don't yet have a 40.5mm filter."
1,Very poor quality a waste of money,I had fallen victim to an attractive package deal and got this filter for practically free and even as a free gift it was terrible.Its too heavy and bulky adds unnecessary size to lens. Its easy to scratch and hard to clean. I had one stubborn spot that I took forever to remove.Yes its cheaper but you will end up throwing it and buying a Hoya or Quantaray so save your time and money.I still have mine if you want it its yours free....
5,UV Protection Filter a Must!,"Tiffen has always produced quality products. Although the UV filter is a simple accessory, it is absolutely necessary to protect your lens.Tips: Have the correct filter size ready for each lens you own. Put the filter on the lens as soon as you get your lens. It is much easier to clean the filter than to clean the surface of your coated lens. Also, if the filter is scratched, replace it. Easier to replace a scratched filter than to repair a scratched lens."
3,You get what you pay for,"There is a reason some filters cost $115 and others (such as this item) are less than $15. That being said, I suppose it's about 95% as good as ones that costs much more.Pros* doesn't rattle* will take one for the team so your lens' front won't have to* can serve well enough until you buy a real filter* it's available on Amazon Prime--few filters areCons* really thick ring, twice as thick as others* vignetting due to this ring* you'll likely want better as soon as you can afford it"
1,Loose Glass,"This Tiffen filter is optically great, however the glass is actually loose in the frame of the filter ring, and rattles back and forth whenever the camera is moved. I ultimately used a small sliver of cardboard to wedge it into place, obviously cut thin enough not to show up in pictures. Product is NOT recommended."
1,Not worth the saved cost,"I brought this product because it's cheap.However, I'm really disappoint about the quality of the product - the finishing of the filter was the worst filter ever seen.When I took the picture of the Moon, I saw 2 Moons so I had to remove the filter.It's useless!!!"
2,Barely a pass grade,"I guess this is what you get when you buy a cheap filter.I will probably stop using it when in a low light conditions, and perhaps at all.Here are the problems that I found with this filter:1. Screwing it into the len is not smooth at all. I would not mind that if I didn't have the second issue.2. In a low light environment with a bright light source in the area/frame I keep on getting reflections that are caused by this filternotWithstandinghen comparing to a shot taken without the filter, the reflection in extremely noticeable.My conclusion... Save your money and buy a better filter!"
3,A bit dissapointing,"I guess the statement, ""You get what you pay for here"", applies. This is the first time I bought a filter, that does not have a screwed surface, on the top of the filter. I usually leave the camera cap snapped into the inside of the filter, when I'm not using the camera. Because of the filter not having the screwed surface on the top of the lens filter I can't do that. The cap has nothing to snap onto, and it constantly falls off. I bought the filter knowing it was not multi-coated, so that really hasn't been a problem, but the buyer should be aware that it's not."
1,Using with Canon EF16-35mm f/2.8L II USM Lens,"It is not the perfect match with Canon EF16-35mm f/2.8L II USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lens in 2 points;1. The Lens cap of Canon EF16-35mm f/2.8L II USM doesn't fit completely on this Protection Filter. The outside edge of Protection Filter is not deep enough for the click feature on Lens cap. So need to be carefule that Lens cap can easily come off with a light shock when this Protection Filter is attached between the Lens and Lens cap.2. Lens Flare is seen more with this Protection Filter on.Since Canon EF16-35mm f/2.8L II USM has the inner focus system, some light (especially taking the night scenes) will be enhanced to be visible as Lens Flares generated by this Protection Filter."
3,"Simple, effective, prone-to-flare!","Just wanted to warn, that this filter on my Panasonic 20mm 1.7 lens causes a lot of flare. Be aware. I'll likely buy a nice B+W filter soon to avoid this. With any bright light source there is a noticeable amount of flare. Thank goodness with digital you see it before you take the photo!"
1,Just so big and thick,"I purchased this with a lens as I always need a filter to protect the exposed lens glass. The metal surround/thread on this filter is huge, the glass is very thick and causes chromatic aberrations. As I used the filter I did not return it but I will never use it again. At the first opportunity I got an alternative filter that is light weight, thin and causes no extra chromatic aberrations. This may have cost less than the alternative but it was not money well spent."
2,Reflections/Lens Flare,This filter causes lens flares/internal reflections when used on my Nikon AF-S 50mm 1.4G lens. It's unusable when I have a light source in a photo because it will have a green lens flare on it.I gave it two stars instead of one because it does it protects the lens from dust/damage.
5,"flawless unit, exactly as described",My filter arrived promptly and it was in perfect condition. It installed with no problem and I could not observe any adverse effect on image quality.
2,Sigma 70-300mm f/4-5.6 SLD DG Macro Lens bundled with TiffenUV Protection Filter,"Amazon offered the Sigma 70-300mm f/4-5.6 SLD DG Macro Lens bundled with the TiffenUV Protection Filter, for my Nikon 3100. Since the filter was supposed to be for the Sigma lens, (58mm) I was expecting a 58mm filter and not a 52mm. Since I failed to pay attention, obviously the filter is too small. I need to have a 58mm. I know, it was not a big investment, but if it does not fit ... it does not fit."
1,Causes ghost images,"I found that when I attached this filter to my Panasonic micro four thirds lens, it caused ghost images of anything bright in the field of view. I double-checked by removing the filter and - lo - the ghost images were banished."
2,good product sent wrong size,I ordered a sigma lens the same time I ordered the filterand the wrong size filter arrived 52mm instead of 58mm the lens size for the filterI sent it back and they credited my account. need to tighten up QC double check your order before clicking on it
3,Good quality but poor results,"The Tiffen lens filter is well-made and protects the camera's lens, but hardly any difference--still almost as much bluish tint when taking snow pictures. Notice green bubbles when a bright light is overhead, but this probably no fault of the filter, but rather a reflection by the camera's lens. I don't know what is true here, but I would recommend spending more for a multi-coated lens filter, or use the Snow Scene on the camera to handle the bluish cast.I don't recommend this filter unless you are willing to go the inexpensive way of protecting your camera from a potential lens-shattering fall, and maybe help reduce the risk of damage to the lens if you aim it directly at the sun (pardon the suggestion--furthermore, vertical bars appear in the viewfinder, which could make almost everything in the photo look extremely dark). Be glad you did!"
3,Only protect first element but it is cheap,"Got this one for my very entry level Nikon D40's kit lens. Frankly I regret that I should ignore the ""brand name"" of this filter, since it is neither well designed or well built. It has NO coating, and noticeably reduces resolution/contrast. However, for a $5 protector it does its job. So I only recommend it to those need a really cheap glass to protect a cheap lens, and you may want to dismount it when indoor or any chances you feel there is no danger of damaging your lens."
4,"Seems to be good quality, but mine arrived with dust on it","This seems to be a fairly basic cover for your expensive lens. Simply, this is good insurance. The optics looks perfectly fine to me. I can discern absolutely zero difference between photos taken with - and without - the filter applied. That said, the filter arrived covered in white dust and I was suprised that they didn't include a cheap lens wipe in the package."
4,77mm UV Lens,I just bought an expensive Nikon 70-200mm f2.8 lens. I wanted to protect my investment. The Tiffen 77mm UV filter has worked great. I have seen no issues with having the lens covered with the Tiffen UV filter.
4,Didn't like the packaging,"There is nothing much a UV filter has to do, so of course I cannot give it a 3 star or lesser rating. I have a UV filter from kenko and they seem much better.But for the price I bought ($2.93) who am I to complain :)"
1,Do not purchase from Dr. Buys used items shipped,"I ordered a Tiffen 86CUVP 86C mm UV filter which was recommended for my Nikon 500mm lens. I buy protective filters for all my lenses and am a professional cameraman. I have never seen a filter come in a plastic after market zip bag. Before putting the filter on the lens, I held it in the light and low and behold this lens is used not new. I would give this seller a 0 Stars if I could. The filter had smudges as if the person had rubbed to clean it without using lens cleaner and there were hairline scratches... probably from the way they cleaned the filter. NO Tiffen filter comes without a hard case. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM DR. BUYS!!!!!!!"
1,Make sure you get the right size filter for your lens,"Careful...the filter comes in various sizes. When I ordered, it evidently defaulted to 52mm - not a good thing since my camera has a 55mm lens. In effect I bought a paper weight which offers UV protection. Don't let the same thing happen to you."
2,Fail filter,"I bought this filter for my newly bought 70-200mm recently. I'm currently on a trip in San Francisco where I dropped my bag. Thankfully I swapped this cheap baby to my 24-70mm with my B+W Filter (which is 70 bucks apx). This filter failed to protect my lens. The front element cracked, and now the filter is stuck to my 1500 dollar lens. Great..."
3,lens uv,"for the price it was worth getting just to protect my new sigma lens, used in various lighting with noe big issues. wish i could afford a better and higher quality lens butI am no pro."
1,Ghosting,"Pros:-the packaging-was clean out of the box-perfectly fit my 50mm 1.8 af-sCons:-produces ghosting when pointed at lights, this is unacceptable and the reason I give this product 1 star"
5,it's a good UV filter:),"what can you say about UV filter. Easy on , easy off, no blur. was packed not so good. I got it when it was misplaced in original box. But after close inspection didn't find any damage so i'm using it and it dose the job."
1,Never received this item,"Ordered it back in Dec '11 and still waiting this filter to arrive.I'm with US Army and stationed overseas, so I typically expect shipping to be delayed.. but in this case after 2 months of waiting I would have to say this is either never sent by the seller or some how got lost in the mail.Not sure what I can do in this case.. so if Amazon customer service can able to help track this, I'd greatly appreciate it!Tks,Bon"
4,"Cheap, works fine.",No problems with this filter. Using it on a nikon 18-200 VR and it works just fine.
2,tiffen 67mm uv filter,Filter arrived with what appeared to be finger smudges around 50% of the circumference and spots of ? in the center. It did clean up nicely.phil
2,size poor,"I got this, the product itself seems good, but didn't fit my camera, didn't get it returned so stuck with it. Guidance on sizing, models, etc would be very helpful for the novice camera person."
1,terrible build,"ok it could happen i got the one bad filter on the rack, but unlikely. my gear lens wise was given to me by my sister really sweet stuff awesome quality, either she unloaded tons of cash on the lenses or the quality has dropped like crazy over the years.this really just a sup par product, it gets stuck on the lens hard to get off, then the build quality is just terrible.the glass seems pretty cheap, but im probably gonna have to keep it cuz it'll probably cost more than 5 bucks to ship it back, we'll see what they say at the post office."
1,Not for a Pentax 50mm lens,"Same as the hood offered together with the 50mm lens; it fits the hood but not the lens unless you use an adaptor, which is not the idea. It is NOT for a Pentax 50mm lens!"
3,REFLECTS,Light sometimes reflects onto the filter when not using a lens hood. The light creates odd shapes and doesn't look good. This filter MUST be used with a lens hood!
5,Great protection!,"A protective lens like this just saved another camera of mine! I dropped the camera, and the protective lens cracked, but the camera lens (and ring) were fine. I think the fact that this lens has a metal frame helped a lot. I strongly recommend using protective lenses on your cameras! It saved me from costly repairs!"
3,Durable but mediocre,"I only use this filter when I'm shooting in extreme conditions. It is very durable, and can be cleaned by the edge of my shirt. However, flare is common. I use a Hoya multicoated filter under most conditions if durability is not an issue. The price is right."
3,Good product,The lense cover was great but because the adapter didn't fit properly when it came off the third time I lost it along with the adapter. Not your fault.
1,Came with scratches on the frame.,The filter arrived on time with defects. The glass was OK. But there are deep scratches on the frame. Don't understand how something in that shape could be shipped.
4,Cheap and good filter,This is the cheapest filter to protect your camera lens from dust and finger prints. Always keep one spare handy in your camera case.
3,Exelent,very coolGreat filter very usefulI give it a 5 so greatHighly recommended for any fan of photography
3,Price Match Quality,"Product is fairly priced, exactly what i was looking for since i have purchased Tiffen filters before. Quality is ok.,"
3,good deal...,"i ordered this filter, it never came. so i called amazontelling them nothing came on that date. and they mailed mea new one. thanks considering."
1,Doesn't Fit,Do not buy this filer for the G-9 Canon camera. It does not fit. The lens on the G-9 cannot have a filter attached.
3,Difference in pictures,I haven't noticed much of a difference in my photos with the UV protection filter on or off. I guess mainly I use it as a lens protector.
1,filter,"new camera, bought uv lens to protect lens, did not fit because camera has no threads on lens. returned item."
2,did not fit,my camera lens even though it is 58mm. not sure why it does not fit. tried it on a different lens as well.
1,does it work?,I purchase this along with a lens a lens that was on sale by amazon not a reseller ! got the filter in few days never have had a chance to use it because the lens after a month and a half still has not come. swo this might be a great filter and will update. Iwill not buy any lens from amazon again ! all of their resellers have the lens but they can't get a reorder? unbelievable!!
3,A Decent First Filter,This filter came free with my lens purchase and so far has worked well. No problems with my pictures. The sharpness is great and there were no imperfections in the filter that would cause problems. I used it for taking photos of waterfalls and the beach and it worked well to protect the lens from spray. A good all around lens protector.
3,Basic filter,"No optical problems and mechanically sound. No loosening of the retaining ring, as with some filters. Only issue is that I wish it were thinner."
4,suits the purpose,I bought this filter to protect the glass of my 50mm lens. It suits the purpose just fine and doesn't affect image quality that I can tell.
3,does its job,"Does its job of protecting the lens, isn't as nice as the Hoya HMC but what do you want its half the price"
3,"Good, but produces unwanted glare","Great price, works fine, seems sharp, but I recently noticed it produces substantial glare when pointed towards bright objects such as a window on an overcast day. Oh well."
1,52MM Tiffen UV Filter,"Mounted this filter on a Canon 50mm F1.8 lens. On semi-strong light sources, it has significant flare. Removed filter, flare went away. Looking for a higher quality 52mm UV filter now. Can't recommend this filter due to flare. Check the pictures for this product to see flare and no flare example (Tiffen UV filter removed from lens)."
1,Tiffen UV Protection File\ter,Bought this to go with the Olympus four-thirds E PL 2 camera. It is totally useless because it does not screw onto the lens. Shame on Amazon for recommending the purchase of this turkey along with the camera. It was cheap enough so it's not worth the hassle to try to return it and get a refund. Don't waste your money on this.
1,UV Filter on Panasonic Camcorder,"This filter should NEVER be recommended for use on this camcorder and probably most camcorders. Works ok when shooting video BUT when shooting still photographs, using flash, it's horrible. The flash shoots through the filter which distorts everything.I bought this filter thinking it was a good idea and it was recommended on page with the camcorder. AGIAN IT SHOULD NEVER BE RECOMMENDED WITH THIS CAMCORDER AND PROBABLY MOST CAMCORDERS!!!"
3,Protect your valuable lenses,Good enough to protect your valuable lenses. But do not expect any enhancement of photographic quality as advertisement.
1,"If you own 18-105mm VR nikon, Do not buy it !!!!!","One of my friends brought it from here for a new 18-105mm vr nikkor (from D90 kit). After attached it to the lens, you will see a small spot at the middle. He showed it to me for finding the reason. I said Oh god remove it immediately.But it is too late. The glass of the filter hit the glass of the lens. The filter was returned, but the spot is still on the lens forever. - -""Update 07/06/10One of my friend bought this filter for 18-105mm. Again !!, the same problem"
1,UV filter is junk,The 58mm UV filter would not fit any of three 58mm Canon lenses in my bag. The threads are just poorly cut. In the mailbox for return already.
1,Disappointing,"When this filter was delivered, the glass was loose in the frame so it made a clanging sound all the time. That was not only annoying, but also caused a bit of the glass to chip off the side. In addition, you cannot put a lenscap over this filter, which is at least inconvenient. CANON, in contrast, makes filters that take a lens cap or yet another filter.Returning it is not an option since I do not reside in the US, so all the shipping costs would not be worth it. Or else I would definitely get rid of it. So my primary point is the poor quality of TIFFEN and disappointment that AMAZON did not inspect it before shipping and sold a defected product."
1,"Would not buy again, spend money on a better one","I bought this to replace a Canon UV filter that rolled down a mountain. Yesterday I was at Lake Louise taking pictures outside of beautiful scenery only to find that this Tiffen filter created a problem where there were reflections of the lens and adapter for the filter on my pictures!!! The reflection problem was sometimes just an extra smudge on the bottom-- but very obvious and pretty bad. It was worst in very bright conditions. I am going to order the Canon filter again. The problem was not that I had any condensation or smudges on my filter, because I had cleaned it off that morning.Given that most of my pictures are with lots of light/ outside, this is useless to me and I regret bringing it with me. I will finish this trip out without this filter."
4,Can't beat it,Good UV and overall protection for your lens. Crystal clear.Can't beat it for the price.
4,Tiffen 77mm UV Filter - shipping is the slowest eveeee e e rr,"how do you gain the long term customer is the fast turnaround!the slowest release for shipment ever.not the transient time is slow, but the release by the seller."
3,I ordered the wrong size,"Make sure you know the exact measurement of your lens before ordering a filter, they are not all exactly identical."
1,Did not work...,This UV Filter would not accept the Tamron lens cap for the lens purchased with the filter... the filter glass was loose in the frame. It didn't cost much .. i.e. was cheap.
4,Does Its Job,"Bought this to protect my kit lens. I'm not one to put extra glass in front of my lens/sensor, but this guy hasn't had any noticeable effect on pictures. And it took the brunt of an impact after the camera slipped off my shoulder.At the price, I'd definitely pick another one of these up if I ever needed to."
5,happy with the Tiffen filter,"For years Tiffen has made a good, well priced product. I immediately put in on the lens and shot a job with it. The packaging was good and the product was as I expected."
4,Tiffen 58mm filter,"Good price, good product and very good service.I'll buy things i need from AMAZON.com again. Thanks."
2,Worth it for the money......,"....since it was free. The filter does not appear to have any coatings, it flares and does cause a noticeable reduction in image contrast. I use this only where a protection filter is needed, where there is a spalsh hazard or sand/grit/flying debris in the air. Outside of those situations, be sure to remove this filter before shooting."
4,Nice budget filter,"I bought this filter with the Canon 50mm 1.8 II, and it is a perfect filter for it. I've been shooting in cold weather with it and it has never fogged up and resists dust buildup well. It is a perfectly priced filter for a budget consumer lens like the 50mm. It is threaded on both sides to facilitate filter stacking or lens hoods."
4,Filter,"I just use these to protect the main lens from getting dirty or scratched. If this gets scratched, or bent from dropping it, I just throw it away and get another one. It is cheap lens insurance. Plus it helps seal the lens from rain."
4,Basic lens protector,"All I wanted was a basic lens protector and this does the job well. The first filter I got from Amazon had a bubble near the perimeter, so I sent it back for a replacement. Not sure if this is an unusual miss or a ding on Tiffen's quality. Replacement was fine. Amazon shipped the replacement the day I complained and paid for the return. Go amazon!"
4,Save your lens!,"I recently had a mishap where I dropped one of my Nikon zoom lenses and it landed face-down. The filter rim took the brunt of the fall, so while the cap and filter glass were smashed, the lens itself was thankfully intact.Get a clear or UV filter like this for each of your lenses as a safety precaution against scratches and other accidents that could ruin your perfectly good lens. This Tiffen filter is a good option because it's pretty affordable and comes in a size that's common among Nikon lenses."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FILTER,"it produces intense flares, if you just want to protect the lens, then this is you filter, but its the only function it really has, pay the extra money to get a nice coated filter, its the intelligent choice in the long run, again please don't waste your money in this product as i did."
4,Great value,This filter does the job for an excellent price. It has no color tint when held up in front of white paper. The filter is well protected in transit with the plastic container.
4,UV filter,"Product came pretty fast and it does the job. Its mainly a protection for my lens and the UV protection is minimal but the fit was great, construction of the lens is glass"
2,Fingerprints,It's really unpleasant to find so much dust and fingerprints on a supposedly brand new rather expensive filter
3,Good basic lens protector,Good basic lens protector from Tiffen. Thou this is much better quality than the UV protection filter from opteka.
1,ripped off. received an empty package,i received a box with a completely empty package inside. ripped off. now i won't have the product for the event i was preparing for. do not order from these people.
1,Does NOT fit Power shot S5IS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I ordered my canon powershot S5IS (from Amazon), you recommended this filter, both as filter and as a lense protector. Naturally, I wanted it. It arrived a few days after the camera, which was not too much of a problem, but the thing is a SCREW mount, and the mount on my camera IS NOT A SCREW MOUNT!!! The size may be appropriate, but without duct tape (not a real attractive option), it is positively useless to this camera."
1,Why does the glass lense shake?,It seems like the glass filter moves around. Is it suppose to do this?
1,Very cheap.,"Very disappointed. Glass slides around within enclosure and appears to have defects on edges of glass. Will try to return, but it was so cheap, I expect I will eat the loss if they give me much hassle trying to retun."
3,ok filter without coating,this filter has a very thick lens and itlooks cheap compare to hoya standard coat filter. It can protect your lens but it will not reduce interal reflection. Buy hoya standard coat.
2,not a great filter,"I bought this filter to protect a Canon EF 85mm/f1.8. It does the job, but I get noticeably better photos with it off. I guess the debate rages over whether a filter to ""protect"" the lens is even a good idea, but I usually like to have one on, especially if I'm outdoors or in a dustry environment.If you are going to go the ""protect the lens"" route, I'd recommend something better, like the HMC / multicoated filters from Hoya."
2,tiffen filter,filter is ok..I get a lot of reflection on the pics taken with flash or if bright lights are in the background( Christmas lights etc)
1,"Junk, severe ghosting","I experienced severe ghosting when a light source was in my viewfinder with this filter on my Tamron 17-50 f/2.8 and Canon 50 f/1.4 prime (both using different sizes of Tiffen UV filters). removed the filters and the ghosting immediately went away. I replaced with premium, coated Hoya filters and have no issues. It's strange because I didn't experience this problem on a Tiffen UV filter I bought 3 years ago."
1,Lens Flare,"Should never have gone with the cheap filter. There is too much lens flare/reflection. Taking pictures in front of a lit Christmas tree & the reflection off the filter is ridiculous. Might make a good coaster for an energy drink, but nothing more."
4,Byzantine Student,"This is probably the most historically accurate novel that I have read that takes place in Constantinople/the Byzantine Empire. The story was pretty good, but not great. I don't think I have read any of Alfred Dugan's other books, so I am not sure if he writes this way in all of his books, but his style of writing was vaguely reminiscent of Anna Comnena's ""Alexiad"". However, I could not quite figure out what the title had to do with the story since the main female character was not held for ransom, although her husband was.Anyway, there aren't a lot of historical novels out there that are set in the Byzantine Empire, but this one was wonderfully accurate when compared to a couple of others that I have recently read, Michael Ennis' laughably stupid ""Byzantium"" and Cecelia Holland's ""Belt of Gold"" which was ok (way better than ""Byzantium"") but not as good as this."
4,True Hong Kong Cinema,"I enjoyed this film a lot. It definitely merits repeat viewings. It is a great mix of story and action; though, the treat is watching the special unit of cops interact. It is heart-warming to see how this dysfunctional family bonds and cares for each other. It also allows a glimpse into what Hong Kong films are; it doesn't marginalize you, it instead includes you. Overall, a great buy."
3,A fun movie,This early James Garner movie with Natalie Wood cannot be looked at in anyway but in fun. The romance is done with humor and lightness. I enjoyed it. Dean Jagger plays Natlie's dad with his usual believable touch. I enjoyed this light comedy.
4,As Always James Garner is Great,"Cash McCall Feb 18 2013A good movie. One of James Garner's early ""con-man"" efforts (1960), He expanded on this character, adding his now-famous texas twang in ""The Wheeler Dealers"" (1963) diff character name but same con-man tricks, which is also very good. Natalie Wood was stunning.Shows the back-stabbing business world at it's typical!Don't waste your time on the LAME cartoon included!"
4,Great movie wheres the DVD?,Love the movie But where is the DVD?It is a very very good classic move that I really enjoyed alot.
4,Cash McCall,"The story is a little light, but enjoyable. James Garner plays a corporate raider and greenmailer, except this is circa 1960. Think of it as ""Wall Street"" with a kinder, gentler Gordon Gekko. Garner will play a similar role three years later in 1963's ""The Wheeler Dealers."" Natalie Wood reminds you of what a beautiful actress is really like. The most interesting part is witnessing how the much the Wall Street's takeover game has been around for quite a while, and the techniques were just refined and corrupted in the 80's, 90's and today."
4,Not Garners best,A couple of great stars doing their best with not the best script. Still it easy to watch and you will not be disappointed.
4,A perspective of global climate,"Some of the reading was a bit difficult. I bought it for a course in global climate changes. I was concerned that I did not know much about the subject, but the book was helpful in giving me a base of understanding. Some of the topics went into a depth that was beyond me, So I have to suppose it would also be helpful for someone who is not a novice at the subject."
3,Cheap jacks,"This product consists of 3 parts. The frame, the plate and the RJ45 jacks. The frame and plate are fine. The RJ 45 jacks are not the best. When testing the cable runs with a micro test I found that when the plug is pushed in all the way some of the pairs lost connection. When I pulled it back to where the clip was holding it it would work. I have never had this happen with any other jacks that I have installed. I haven't connected any computers yet so I do not know how it will fare when I do. I figure if it doesn't work I will just replace the RJ 45 jacks with some others. They are just keystone jacks."
5,He's as good as they say.,"I'd heard people talking about Howard Waldrop, but I'd never read him before (except maybe one story). Wow, he really is as good as they say, definitely weird and some of the stories take some work to figure them out, but when you do, they're great. And the introductions are just as interesting."
3,I don't get it.,"Since this is the 4th Waldrop collection I've read, one might think praise would be effusing from me. Yet, I confess I don't get it. His stories are well-written, if lacking in narrative tug. The are well-researched and he pays readers the compliment of assuming they are intelligent, yet none of this doesn't matter since he changes the facts to suit his alternative-reality urges. Of all I've read in the past, only one story - ""The Ugly Chickens"" - has the feel of a classic. Anybody can rearrange the past (including the literary/mythic past) - in Waldrop the point that's missing is ""Why?"""
3,An unnecessary release from Genesis,"'Turn It On Again: The Best of 1981-1983' isn't an official Atlantic release, which really makes you wonder why this is even on the market.Most of the songs were taken from 'Abacab,' 'Three Sides Live' and 'Genesis.' Although several songs here appear as b-sides on singles (most notably 'Paperlate') others appear on the official releases.Overall, don't waste your money and time on this set. Buy their official records. Or, if you're looking for a good single-disc compilation, check out 'Turn It On Again: The Hits,' which covers the 1981-1983 period relatively well.But, unless your a die-hard Genesis fan who must have everything the group ever released, skip this one."
2,"Pretty Bracelet, Poor Quality Scarabs","The silver bracelet offered a very pretty setting, but I was so disappointed in the quality of the scarabs. Typically, scarabs have a nice sheen, but these were dull and lackluster. Silver Speck refunded my money."
5,Love It!!,"I love this bracelet and the shine on the scarabs are great. I just wish you used a lobster claw clasp inside of a spring clasp closure and the scarabs should be a little deeper cut. Nevertheless, it's nice a bracelet for the price."
5,Cinematic perfection.,"It is just unbelievable the way director Kiarostami manages to communicate so much about our conflicts and contradictions using such few elements, and at the same time allowing so many different interpretations. Film-making at its best!!"
4,The Taste of Cherry we should all appreciate,"I feel that this movie is trying to teach a moral lesson to the viewers. A man who had contemplated committing suicide reminds the main character of the movie, who also is planning on committing suicide, of the simplicity of life and all the beautiful things in life that we do not appreciate, such as the taste of cherry."
4,SMALL SENSE OF HOPE,"Abbas Kiarostami is probably Iran's best known director, and this film is a good example of why. A deftly handled and sensitive tale of a sensitive subject... the contemplation of suicide. The tale is set in modern day Tehran, and it slowly follows the story of a relatively successful man who drives around, and as the viewer learns, is searching for someone who will help him to kill himself. He meets a succession of individuals and discusses his plans with them. Each man provides his own thoughts on the subject, all ultimately refusing to go along with the plan. The story is a bit difficult and pointless to describe. The bleakness of the subject matter is best described by the film itself. In the end you will feel a small sense of hope."
4,Wonderfully engaging--but falls apart at the end,"A man, seemingly sincere in his efforts, drives through Iran, looking for someone to assist him in his efforts to commit suicide. During his ""terminal journey,"" we meet a cross-section o f his culture, some willing to help, others not. But in the end, we learn it's all a sham, a failm making exercise--a bit like the 3rd grader's conclusion to a nightmare scenario: ""And then the alarm clock awoke me."""
5,KIROSAWA...FELINI...KIAROSTAMI...,"If you liked Kirosawa's 'Rashomon', you'll love 'Taste of Cherry'. This is a brekthrough not only in Iranian film making, but world cinema as a whole. Kiarostami challenges your intellect by taking you to the edge. A must see."
1,BOOOOORING AND PRETENTIOUS,"I cannot believe this film shared the Palm d'Or with the much better Japanese film, ""The Eel,"" in 1997. ""The Eel"" is everything that ""A Taste of Cherry"" is not and Kiarostami can learn a lot from Imamura: provocative film images (e.g. white street light turning red, man plunging into an aquarium, etc.), an assortment of interesting and diverse characters, black comedy, great story line (i.e. man's inability to connect with one another--hence the character who tries to communicate to the UFOs), and lots of metaphors (e.g., eel, UFOs, unaccepted lunch boxes, etc.). I have seen ""The Eel"" five times and am still not bored with it whereas I kept checking my watch to see what time it was during ""A Taste of Cherry."" I know it's unfair to compare films but I really believe there's no comparison between ""The Eel"" and ""A Taste of Cherry."" Do yourself a favor and check out ""The Eel"" instead."
4,Sometimes questions are more powerful when unanswered,"We never find out the reason for Badi's despair. We don't know what tortured path this Iranian man has taken, a route which has lead him towards the decision of suicide. He plans to take all his sleeping pills and lay in a shallow grave on a hillside, under a lone tree. He pleads for assistance in his plan with different people passing, a virtual slice of Iran's diversity (a Kurd and a Afghani are among them), before he finds the wise and sympathietic taxidermist who quietly accepts the proposal.You don't really need to know the source of this man's emotional state, but you'll watch as he tries to preserve his dignity. It's an often slow moving film, but the visual images are thoughtful and provocative."
3,an interesting film,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.This film explores the ethics of suicide from an Islamic standpoint. It surpirsed me initialy that Iranian films were allowed to be shown in the US given the current sanctions with their government. Interestingly, the Iranian government's censorship of films is more relaxed than I expected. (Though the opening koranic verse is shown on the screen before the film starts)The Farsi/Persian name of the film is Ta'm e guilass. The film itsel is directed by Abbas Kiarostami. The story deals with a man who intends to commit suicide by taking sleeping pills, who drives around looking for someone to go to a spot the next day to see if he is still alive and bury him if he is dead or take him home if he survives. The people he asks to help him try to talk him out of doing himself in.The DVD has a theatrical trailer, filmography of the director and an interview with the director for special features."
2,Squandered Potential,"The basic skeleton of this movie (guy looking for help with his suicide plan) has huge philosophical and spiritual potential. However, this movie delivers almost nothing of what it could have. I guess the director wants to leave all of the thinking to the audience. What it left me thinking is, ""Why does Mr. Badii want to kill himself?"" Another thing I was left thinking was, ""Why are they wasting so much time showing Mr. Badii driving around?""This movie would have been great if it had only been half an hour, because there is at least one hour of this film devoted to showing a truck driving around."
1,Deception!,"Photo is inaccurate & the seller refuses to refund my money. They sent a thigh high boot (over-the-knee), NOT the below-the- knee type indicated in the photo. When I contacted them about it, their explanation was ""everyone's legs are different lengths"" & ""they do not accept returns for sanitary reasons"". Shoe stores accept returns! I didn't even try on both boots. Unless the woman is the photo is a giraffe, they are inaccurately advertising this product!"
5,Wonder Woman Boots,"I love these boots! I made my Wonder Woman costume for this past Halloween event and it completed my look! I saw some other Wonder Woman costumes and I have to say, I was the best :)The shoes were comfortable to walk and dance in and the boots went a little passed my knees than the one you see in the picture. Overall, I like the product and will certainly where this costume next year!"
1,Costume Disaster,"These boots are fabulous at first sight! Just what I needed to complete my Wonder Woman costume! I tried them on when I first received them, and they were great. Here comes the big Halloween weekend, and I have one boot on. Pulled on the left boot and tried to zip it up and the zipper broke. Keep in mind I had NEVER worn these other than to make sure they fit. There was no fixing the zipper, and so in order to have a costume I had to buy white duct tape and tape my boot shut. These are very cheaply made and I am highly disappointed in them. I don't recommend these boots to anyone."
4,"Thought Provoking, Intellectual, and Insightful, but plot could be better","Mahfouz is a very talented writer. The literature is very rich and the devices he uses contribute to the fascination of the reader with the character of Ibn Fattouma. At times even, readers will become vicariously sullen or extatic because of the skillful characterization. The concepts in this book about post-modern religion and the role of an intellectual are great fodder for discussion and will keep people who love to think engaged for a while, but the plot is not as strong as the writing or interpretative aspects. The debacles that Fattouma faces on his journey are not very engaging always and at times deviate from realism (deviation from conceptual implications). When reading the book, I imagine that most people will be waiting anxiously for the next glimpse into Fattouma's psychology and analysis of the world around him and few will pay attention to the actual plot and sideplots."
4,Quite Interesting,"This short novel offers a very interesting and contemplative exploration of the difficult political systems. Ibn Fattouma experiences living in the traditional monarchy, the totalitarian state, the liberal republic, and the democratic country. His long journey subjects him to fascinating mind cultivating experiences as well as horrific sufferings. At the end he goes in pursuit of an illusive- or real- mountain symbolic of the utopia or El Dorado. People will never find comfort or stability regardless of where they are and the circumstances that surround them and they will go on searching for the perfect place on this earth."
2,Don't start here,"I was excited when my book group picked this title, since I'd never read Mahfouz and was curious about this Noble-prize-winning writer, who many friends admire. But the Journey of Ibn Fattouma was a stunning disappointment: it's a collection of simple morality tales that seem to me, at best good for children or young adults. The writing has none of the artistry of a Borges or Calvino, which was my hope: it feels flat-footed and plods aimlessly along from place to place, a bit like the protagonist of the fables. Indeed, for somebody interested in rich journeys to imaginary places, Calvino'sInvisible Citiesis a far, far better book, a masterpiece in comparison. If you haven't read Mahfouz before, I'd say this is the wrong place to start, at least based on my experience."
4,"Fun, Bemusing Reading","The stories (and one novella) are set in and around Finney's invented township of Manacle, Arizona.Finney covers such topics as a local manifestation of the ""Black Dog"" motif familiar in England's folklore; the bizarre offspring of a Gila Monster and a shrike; a curse on good-deed-doers; and a quest for buried treasure, wherein just about every character is related, and very few don;t want to kill each other.Finney's craft is such that the possible preciousness of his style is outweighed by his creativity and good humor. These are fun stories to be read with one eyebrow cocked, for they were doubtless written tongue-in-cheek.The cover blurb of the 1964 paperback is ""The damndest book you ever read."" I might not go THAT far, but it's a fun read, and comes from a guy whose creative net stretches across the Arizona horizon."
5,"No wonder this book is ""out of print""","One of the great books written about Croatian genocide against Serbs and Vatican's involment in this holocaust. Over 250 catholic priests took part and even led Croats in bruttal extermination of Serbs from Croatia. This crime is hidden and remains hidden from public eyes since Vatican was so heavily and seriously involved. Will we ever see Avro Manhatan's book ""Vatican's Holocaust"" available on Amazon? I doubt it....."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,I usually love this author. I knew exactly what was going to happen next. Very disapointing.
2,Really not for me,"Maybe I'm outgrowing chick lit? Or maybe this was just crap. I'm not sure. The last few chick lit books I've read have not really been enjoyable to me, so I'm sort of leaning towards the former; but maybe I'm just making bad choices. There were not any characters in this book that I liked. They are all reprehensible, selfish and annoying. Two families are thrown together in the same house for a week of holiday and it's starting to look like it wasn't an accident. The books that Wickham wrote under the pen name Sophi Kinsella are highly enjoyable fun. But the ones written under her own name have been barely more than average in my opinion. This one is just pretty bad. I wish I could go back to my self two weeks ago and take this away."
2,Boring,"It's hard to believe that Sophie Kinsella wrote this. She's come a long way in her writing since then. It was almost like a child wrote this book. Her books since and including the Shopaholic series are clever, witty and the characters are always endearing. These characters were very one-dimensional. It had a nice premise but just didn't follow through for me."
2,A one-sitting piece of fluff,"I can see how this book might have been pretty interesting as a character study, unfortunately, I didn't like any of the characters. They seemed just a little off and a bit phony - not quite two-dimensional, but flat in some respects. And a lot unbelievable in others, especially in ways that screamed convenience, plot-wise. Speaking of plot... it was a bit thin, as well. Sure, the main premise was understandable enough, the old ploy of throwing enemies in together and seeing what happens. But the problem is that nothing really extraordinary or interesting does happen. It's all very predictable and clichéd, and the ending is a complete disappointment.On the up side, the writing was very easy to read and I sped through the book in one sitting.I wouldn't particularly recommend this book to anyone, but the writing this author has done under the name 'Sophie Kinsella' is far, far better and I suggest you check out those before you pick up this one."
3,Funny Light read,"Funny Light summer read. Enjoyed for a diversion, storyline is somewhat predictable, but fun anyway. Shipping was super and very fast. Perfect condition."
4,This is what I liked and disliked...,"This book was the first book I've read of Sophie Kinsella as ""Madeleine Wickham"" and I really couldn't put it down. The author designs really fun surprises in the book that are unpredictable and entertaining.I kind of didn't like the end so much only because it left a flavor of ambiguity in my mouth after reading. It lacked closure for me and I wished it had ended with the characters revealing different things to each other.Other than that, she really plots and strategizes the scenarios really well. It's a very fun read."
2,Sleeping Arrangements left me a little sleepy...,"This was my first Madeleine Wickham book. It was good reading but I didn't feel there was an ""umph"" to the story. I am a Sophie Kinsella/Wickham fan.This one just wasn't one of my top picks. For me, it wasn't too memorable."
3,it's okay,"I loved the other book. This one seemed like it was written on a deadline- plot line tried to be clever, but was not. I had high hopes!"
2,Made it through,"I finished this book, but ugh, it was terrible. I love Sophie Kinsella, but I am not impressed with her writings as ""Madeleine Wickham.""I do not recommend this book."
4,A good summer or vacation read.,Some good British humor...a good fast read. I would recommend this book to my reading friends.I liked it so much I bought more Madeleine Wickham books!
3,average,"average chick-lit. not great, not bad. I read and finished it, but wouldn't put this one at the top of my list. there are others i would go to first. It was still good-ish."
2,BORING!,"I expected so much more from this book. The plot was predictable, the inner monologues went on endlessly, and then nothing happens. Everyone goes home.So the point was to be happy with what you have. It was not my favorite and I cant believe the same author wrote this. It was pure fluff."
1,"Loathesome characters, obvious plot","Two couples and their children end up sharing a vacation villa. Will they cheat and break up their families? Given that this is supposed to be an upbeat chick-lit book, not an angsty drama, what do you think? I found the adult characters two dimensional and unappealing. Only the fact that I have enjoyed many of her other books kept me reading to the end. I don't know why but the books she writes as Kinsella are much, much better than the Wickham books."
2,Should've gone to the library for this one...,"I'm very angry with myself for giving in to an impulse buy for this book. The plot was thin, the characters were annoying and I was praying for the end long before the midway point. Sadly, there's really not much else I can say..."
2,Not her best,"I have read quite a few of Miss Wickham's/Kinsella's books, but was rather disappointed with this one. I just didn't care about any of the characters. It was an easy read and vaguely entertaining, though predictable. But I can't really recommend it. Try Gatecrasher or something by Marian Keyes or Isabel Wolff instead."
2,Expected so much more!,"I love Sophie Kinsella's books and thought I would enjoy one with her as Madeleine Wickham, but this was just not even close to the quality I was expecting from her. I found myself quickly skimming just to get to the end and call it a day. It was not a ""page-turner"" in a positive sense of the phrase. I did not feel attached to any particular characters. The plot jumped around which made certain excerpts seem pointless to the storyline. The nanny was just downright annoying. I'm all for characters you love to hate, but there was no love here. The whole reason behind the two families getting stuck at the same villa was stupid. I was hoping for a clever reason behind it all, but I was extremely let down."
2,Not good,"I LOVED the Shopaholic series, and I thought this would be some light, funny reading since it was by the same author. But I pretty much hated the book, as much as I hate to admit it! I read the whole thing, hoping it would get good, but as another reveiwer said, the characters were awful. I didn't like any of them. I really think any half-talented tenth grader could have written the same thing. Most of it is about Chloe, who has to be one of the whiniest, most illogical and overly emotional character ever. Everything makes her want to ""cry out"", even things that don't even happen. She really was so lame. My level of contempt for this character surprises me, I think it represents lazy, contrived writing. Overall, the book was just boring and left me confused as to how it could have been written by the same author who created the witty and hilarious Becky Bloomwood!!"
2,Not for me.,"This book is by the same woman who wrote the Shopaholic series. Had I known that, I wouldn't have bothered with it. Didn't hold my interest, and there was too much British slang for this Yankee. Others probably loved it, but it just wasn't for me."
3,"Entertaining, but wish it was longer","I love this author, especially when she writes as Sophie Kinsella. This book was a fun read, but seemed too short. I enjoyed the characters, and the plot had it's share of twists and turns."
4,Very enjoyable read!,"This was my first read any of Wickam/Kinsella's books. I picked up the pb version at the airport on a return trip and found it very entertaining! I found the humor, strained circumstances, characters/relationships all realistic (a bit too close to home in some cases) and, yet, enjoyable. It's an easy, light read that I highly recommend. Will plan to read other books by this author, just not sure which series to choose."
2,Not as comfortable as you would think for Ugg,I didn't find this flip flop comfortable at all. I am a FF junkie so at the end of the day they ended up in the back of the closet worn just once. Not worth the money.
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"This is one of those horror movies that tries to scare you based on the, ""it could actually happen' premise. The ending makes the movie. When you finally put it all together at the end, you realize that even thou most of the performances sucked, and the story was kinda confusing, it was actually very clever. Up until that point, it's jumpy and confusing as hell, but I can promise you it will keep you thinking and you won't have any idea until the end."
1,I'm DUMBFOUNDED,"What the hell is wrong with all the people that gave this piece of cinematic retardation good reviews... It's like a bad student film. I'm forced to give it at least one star, but it deserves a negative five..."
4,PRETTY GOOD LITTLE THRILLER!!,"I just rented it and watch this flick. Well it is str8 to DVD flick.. Ya is not all that and looks cheap made and have a lots flaws,Thats for sure. But I enjoyed it, Was pretty interesting, Kind of good scrip & Pretty well acting too. The ending unfolded the whole scrip & was kind of shocking & interested! I guess not to buy ... But check it out as rental. Good little thriller flick. B"
5,Piece of mind,"It is exactly as described. that said, be aware that it is a little different from the oem gsr set up. i had to bypass the cooling that goes to the throttle body. no big deal, just thought it should be known. might save someone a headache! HAPPY WRENCHING!!!! DONT FORGET TO TUNE IT WHEN DONE. ALSO....ADJUST TPS to 0.500"
3,"beautiful, but somewhat cheap","This necklace is beautiful, but the chain is cheaply made and unfortunately it is not interchangable. it is also much smaller than it appears in the picture, but I didn't check the measurements before purchase."
1,i have not yet received an issue.,I have not yet receives an issue to rate this magazine.. I will be to rate it when I do.
5,Very Worthwhile Magazine,"There are not too many magazines that you can really enjoy. Some are filled with way too many ads, and others have a lot of things that really don't apply. This magazine blends weight loss issues, along with articles, on food, fashion, and beauty. Their recipes are easy to make, and don't require a lot of complicated ingredients that you can't find. I have enjoyed the articles on beauty and fashion as sometimes we loose focus on the positive things we can do for ourselves. Best of all even if you are not on their program the magazine still has a lot to offer you. I would consider this magazine if you are concerned about eating healthy, losing weight, and trying to look good."
4,Motivates me to stay on plan,"Weight Watchers has helped me stay in a healthy weigth range for five years now. During the course of time, we all need motivation and encouragement. I no longer attend WW meetings, but I read this magazine and use WW's website to help keep me headed in the right diretion. The recipes are good and trying new food keeps me from getting bored. Reading about the success stories of others helps me stay in line too. The advertisements also provide a source of new snack and exercise sources. I only wish the magazine came out every month instead of bi-monthly!"
1,The subscription service is very bad,"I can't honestly review the magazine, as we still haven't received an issue. I ordered the subscription in May for Mother's Day, and it is now September. Following Amazon's instructions, I contacted Synapse Services, Inc.at 800-586-2199 (Synapse fulfills the magazine subscriptions for Amazon.) There was a lot of distortion on their end of the line, and it was difficult to hear the customer service agent. The agent was only able to tell me that we should have received our first issue in July and someone will call me back in 24 hours. I'm not holding my breath."
3,My subscription started with an old issue,The magazine is fine. My problem is that I got my first copy a couple of days ago. That issue is no longer being sold. A new edition is out which I already purchased so I will be getting a year of magazines minus two I already had. I feel ripped off.
3,"ok, not great","these are decent sheets... better than some others i got from amazon trying to save a buck. i dont believe this is egyptian cotton since they are pilling a lot and have a fuzzy surface texture after about 6 months (i dont use them continuously, i rotate between 4 sheet sets). they are about as substantial as a set i have which is about 700TC so i have doubts that they are 1200 but the product is ok. the big disappointment is the pilling, im afraid after another 6 months these might end up looking like flannel.... i purchased wamsutta 750 TC sheets from bed bath and beyond, they are double the price but much better quality. there;s a luster, they havent pilled and are cool to the touch."
5,Wonderful book for people trying to read German,"Because this book is very small, I was a bit concerned about the purchase when it first arrived. But this book has proved very valuable to my understanding of the German language. It is about 185 pages full of material that you would read through, with another forty or so pages of vocabulary. Being an intermediate German student, I still would go slowly over the text, and would have to frequently look at a dictionary, but over time I have been understanding the words without looking them up. This has been such a great way to learn how to read German, and I'm very happy that I purchased this book. I just wish there were more of them, because it would make my studies much easier. >>> I just finished reading this book recently, and have learned so much thanks to this book!"
2,Fantastic publication - but available for much less elsewhere!,"I love the New York Observer, but have subscribed for 1 year for only $14. They offered a Groupon at that price and then later began offering the price directly on their website. Not sure why Amazon is charging this much still."
4,Must-read for city policy-makers and social activists,"David Rusk, former mayor of Albuquerque, NM, puts his experience and research to work in this compelling report. In it, he connects the economic and practical success of America's urban centers with the degree of socioeconomic and racial segregation present in each. The result is a blueprint that local, state and federal officials can use to reverse the troubling trends in our cities. Specifically, he calls for metro-wide planning councils, city-county consolidation, aggressive annexation by older central cities, and changes to state and federal laws to create unified cities without suburbs. The text also includes numerous interesting case studies that demonstrate what, when practiced, his ideas are capable of. Easy-to-read, fascinating, and enlightening. David Rusk is talking. Are America's city officials listening?"
3,Good book,This was a good book. At some times it got a little hard to read and boring but it always came back with something interesting
5,Good,The narriation was awesome because someone was reading the story to you and you didn't have to do it yourself.
5,Imagination Journey,"The theme of this book is basically a mystical wonderland where the unexpected happens. She starts off by falling into a hole, and then her journey in Wonderland begins. Carroll's descriptive language is incredible and he's always engaging your imagination. The only thing that could be better about this book, is if things to make a little bit more sense. But I guess there wouldn't be any fun in that."
4,great read,"Love rereading a childhood favorite . Not the same without the pictures, but definitely worth the time to read again"
5,Good Book,This was a decent book. I liked it. It had a decent story point. More of older generation book. I didn't like it to much.
3,Such a queer book indeed!,"I've been wanting to read this for a while, but I'm not sure what to make of it. Though Alice is an interesting protagonist. A feisty and inquisitive little girl!"
4,Stylish design & kid-friendly,Bought as a collector item with all the recent hype between the 2012 collaboration with Loius Vuitton and Kusama - much cheaper than a purse!Illustrations are bright and colorful and the cloth-like book cover is really attractive.
2,alice,"The marvellous drawings in the original are missing, which was not mentioned in the blurb. If I had known, I would not have bought the item"
3,So so....,"The book wasn't horrible, I didn't read it through to the end. It wasn't great either. I found myself getting bored while reading and only finished the book because I had started it. If you're not a big fan of the movies, don't waste your timr."
4,Confusingly nonsensical,"A quick and easy read, if you don't read into the nonsense! If you've seen the film, the book seems comparatively brief and Alice seems to be exploring Wonderland with no specific purpose. Otherwise, its an interesting read and aptly suggests the nonsensical views a child has on the adult world."
3,Alice in Wonderland,"THE weirdest book I have ever read in my entire life! It is wack! I know people rave about this book, but I really don't know why. It gives me a headache. Only reason I gave it Three stars is because, I'll admit, it is very interesting, but it's weird factor is WAY too high for me."
3,Not the original illustrations,"While this version does have illustrations, they are not the original illustrations by John Tenniel, which was what I was looking for."
2,Horrible Scan,"This is a horrible digitalization of a book. The Title in the Kindle itself has an HTML code for the ' in Alice's and every line is cut off by word wrapping during an OCR.The lines would read something likethis,even though they are a part of thesameparagraph.Avoid."
4,down the rabbit hole,I forgot how wonderful a tale this is. It is written so well that the images almost jump off the page. Even as an adult I couldn't help but to fall under Carroll's spell.
5,"Fun, quirky book",If you've never read Alice in Wonderland then you are missing out. It is the originator of this genre of nonsensical novels that have recently become so popular. Nothing about the book makes much sense but in the grand picture it's a great novel and a champion of the creativity of the human mind.
4,Alice and wonderland,It is a good book and it's easy to read on my Ipod. I also like that I don't have to have the internet to read the book. I hope to find more books to read.
4,Go ask Alice,All I could think of was the song. Go ask Alice when she's 10 ft. tall. And I feel like I fall down the rabbit hole every day.
3,Alice review problems,"Amazon really mixes up the Alice books so One cannot tell which edition is which. I collect by illustrator, but when I click from hard cover to soft cover I get a completely different edition. They need to list artist and publisher and keep on separate pages. Note when it says item being reviewed, it is not the item I started wanting to get a copy of. Mixed up as usual."
5,A for Amazing,"I still really love this book. I know the story almost by heart, I've got the movie, and this book is fabulous. It's free, too, so why don't you have it yet? Get it!"
3,"Five Star Story, Three Star Kindle Version","If you have not read this classic by Lewis Carroll, then by all means pick up this edition. However, I would caution you that, while the story is similar (excepting one poem as far as I can tell) note that this edition is lacking in the illustrations that make this work especially fitting for children. In that respect, if you are using this Kindle ebook as a means to read the story to your children, I would recommend either a pdf version with pictures or purchasing an illustrated version (they aren't expensive at all at this point). Otherwise, if you are reading this simply to sate your own curiosity as to the actual story or to reread the tale now that you are an adult, then this version is fine and you should be able to get along without the pictures.Don't get me wrong, the pictures are a definite added bonus and classic, but I find it hard to argue against downloading this classic anyway, as, well, its free. Enjoy!"
2,Strange Book,"This is one of the strangest books I have ever read. It was extremely weird, but weird in a good way. The storyline was indeed ""curious"" and if you can get past the weirdness then you can enjoy it. At times I could get past the strange aspects of these stories, but other times I thought it was a bit too ridiculous and confusing to say the least. A few times, I had to read a sentence more than once to fully grasp its meaning. There is not really any plot to this book, but I can see how it may be a fun book to read to kids.Definitely not my favorite books, but I did enjoy Alice's Adventures in Wonderland more than Through the Looking Glass. I'm not going to say don't read this because I know a great deal of people enjoy this classic...it's just that I didn't find it all that great. Nevertheless, if you find the time, pick it up if you want to. It's a quick read and you can make your own judgment about it."
5,A stunning rendition of a classic,"This is a must for ""Alice"" collectors of all ages. The art is beautiful and the design is unusual.I disagree with the Booklist reviewer that the design makes for difficult reading or is distracting. The design flourishes enhance the reading experience."
3,Fun characters,This is the first time I read the book in its original version and I found Alice incredibly annoying and is just a pretentious self-centered little girl. Maybe that's what little girls do but surely it annoys me so much that I had the thought to abandon the book when I am 1/5 into it. It is always difficult to read a book when one dislikes the main character. I did finish it and it is a lovely ending. The other characters so fun and interesting - very imaginative and I can see why it is a classic. Guess it is just not my type of classic even though I love children books.
4,Does this recording include Through the Looking Glass as well ?,I haven't yet bought this. I have other Jim Dale narrations and find his performances consistently excellent.I had a quick question before I buy this.Does this recording include Through the Looking Glass as well ? The description on Amazon does not specify that.
1,no wonder its free,From the movies I always assumed this was a good book from a writer with a great imagination. Now that i've read it i've changed my mind considerably. the characters are so nonsensical that in my opinion it makes it very hard to read and i lost interest quickly. i knew that the characters were going to be somewhat crazy but the constant blubbering about nothing was very annoying to read. stick to the movies.
2,The movie Ailce in Wonderland is better. (the 2010 kind),a bad story for children except ages 8 and up.everyone loves Alice in Wonderland (the 2010 kind) movie... Wonder land is awesome but the book eww...
1,To confusing.,"A endless trail of weird things happening, a classic but a boring classic. The story goes to deep for most people. I heard someone say it was a very clever maths problem."
4,Good but I've read better books,im not saying this is a bad book. its soooo much better than the movie (cartoon) my mom hates the book and i didnt really want 2 read it but on the kindle it wuz free and i need more books 2 read on my kindle and free 1s r cool. i like more modern books i guess but i used 2 love historical fiction. i like the new movie even though it is kinda the sequel 2 this 1 and i thought they were so simialar and i would like this 1 2. this wuz really good
2,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.,"Well firstly, I haven't read it yet but im so upset because it's not Audiobook 'cause I don't wamt to read it..... What im saying is that i want it to read for me.............. I'm not saying that it is bad it's just if you have a headache and the book you're reading isn't Audiobook, then your head will be more achy-pachy..... Well im gonna give this only 2 stars so yeah..."
1,Terrible!,Didn't really like how there were no pictures for the different characters. Most of the stuff in the story didn't go along with the movie.
2,ok,i did not enjoy it and i would not read it again. it was great at the begining but in the middle it started going down hill in interest and the end was my least favorite.
4,"""Curiouser and curiouser""","This is the kind of story that sort of addresses children directly and I remember being utterly taken by the story as a child of ten (when I first read it). It inspired me and I used to play out the story with my dolls and dad's playing cards - such fun to be had and all because of Alice in Wonderland! Alice's character is an inspiration to young and old alike - a young girl who says what she thinks and challenges authority, precocious, open-minded, and possessed of an admirable courage in the face of strange and frightening events. It is a story that appealed to me as a child and at a deeper level as an adult appreciative of the wordplay and rich symbolism contained within.As an adult who has read the illustrated versions, the Kindle title is a bonus that I can store and read at my convenience. But I would definitely prefer the illustrated version when reading to my 5-year-old child. Also recommended isThe Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition."
4,Alice's adventures is just that,Professional narration makes this even better than before. The book will take you back to the days you first read this book.
3,It's a classic for a reason,I've always enjoyed Alice in Wonderland. To get it for free is even better. Brings back childhood memories of fantastical realms.
4,Interesting,"A fun quick read. Also interesting about what crazy mind thought this up. Each time she spoke to herself, I laughed out loud."
3,Alice in the wonderland,Well for a 12 year old girl I think they have put a lot of words I don't know and if they took them out I would know what I'm reading
3,ALICE'S ADVENTURES,FREE AS EXPECTED. FREE WHAT DO YOU EXPECT. FREE WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FREE WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FREE WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FREE WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FREE WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FREE WHAT DO YOU EXPECT.
5,A wonder-full read,"Alice in Wonderland is an interesting book about a little girl who dreams of adventures in another world. It all starts with Alice believing to see a White Rabbit go down a hole. She follows it and falls down into wonderland, where she grows on a whim and where everyone is ""mad"". She meets talking animals, moody royalty, and a hatter who believes that it is tea time all the time.All in all, it was a got book and I recommend it to everyone looking for either wit or fantasy."
4,Very interesting!,I felt that the wonderful story by Lewis Carroll was really pulling you into the adventure itself! I suggest this story to all ages because this story really makes you wonder and imagine
4,What a trip,"I actually enjoyed it almost as much as the movie, and loved that it is pretty trippy in some parts!"
1,in good condition,"okay as in condition, but good book the movie is good (johnny depp) I see the book give you more"
4,WONDER IN WONDERLAND,"This book kept me interested the entire time. Since I have seen the movie I knew most of the things that were about to happen, but it still kept me wondering."
2,Excuse me?,"At 48 I had never read this and thought I should for my personal education. I don't understand the fascination with this tale at all. There are some witty observations, but mainly this thing is a one-click pony - madness. For once, the movie is better than the book."
2,Couldn't hold my interest,"There are very few books I've read where I liked the movie better than the book, but this is one of them. This book just couldn't hold my interest and I'm actually fairly surprised it got published to begin with."
5,Wonderful Wonderland,"This is one of the best children's books ever, and there are multiple levels that should appeal to adults. The ideas are magical, the writing is excellent, and the use of language is fantastic. One of the best books ever to read aloud, even if your are alone."
1,Poor quality,The book was missing pages from the front and middle sections. I had to buy another to replace it.
3,"Good, but not like the Movie",This book is good and exciting but some of it is not like the animated movie. My favorite part is when she is with the Queen of Hearts and playing the game.
3,"Interesting, but overrated","It is somewhat hard to relate to the characters as they are from vintage turn-of-the-century English society and I am not. There are many things in the book that don't seem to make sense unless you look at the characters and situations from that perspective. The best aspects of this book are the creative characters and settings; make sure if you buy a copy of this book you get one with the original illustrations. I recommend this book to pretty much everyone; although it is somewhat dated and strange, you should enjoy it."
1,Not far so lovable as the Disney-Movie,"What a boring book. First I saw the Disney-Movie from 1951... those lovable figures, like the brave Alice, the crazy Chesire Cat, the big red Queen and her tiny little king, the wild expressive story. Great. Then the remake or second part of the story with the extraordinary Jonny Depp. But nothing of these great pieces you can find in this book.The only good thing in this book is the crazy story, about a girl in her wonderland with the insane inhabitants.It was a dull writing. Sentences like ""He said... Then she said... Then he said..."" will make you lazy. There is no heart in the story... just a pure and clean describing of the chapters of this story. But what makes a book a good book? It's the describtion of all the surroundings, like how the weather was, what temper the figures have, all the nonrelevant things you want to know. You can't find them in this book. My recommandation: Take another book."
3,A bit of a disappointment,I thought that this particular book would have more illustrations that it does. Other than that it is fine.
3,very interesting,this book was very wierd and interesting. with its caracters and settings. this book makes you want to go down into a hole and meet a rabbit and the mad hatter. it also takes you in to its world...
1,hated it,"I didnt like this at all, i figured it would be a bit more like disney's or tim burton's version, but no dice!!"
2,Insanity in a bad way,"When i was a child this story always captivated me, but reading this tale as an adult left me annoyed and confused. Though the language is remarkable, the story itself us hard to follow at best. It is disjointed and fractured. Characters are introduced for such a brief time that they are not know or likeable by the time they exit. Two stars for ingenuity, but the lacking connectedness."
3,Not so special,"Entertaining, but not so special. Maybe in its time and era it was, but for me it was no more than 3 stars. It was a free Kindle book though, so no money lost here. Thank you, Amazon :))"
5,Go Until The End,A great classic that won't disappoint. The only negative part about this edition is that it lacks any illustration. This could be an issue if you're reading this to a child.
2,Strange story,"This story is never normal, and every time we read it or see performance with this story, we come to the same conclusion. It's hard to understand. Period"
5,another old classic,I read this book because it was on the free list and I had never read it before but it is great reading material especially for younger children as a bed time story
4,It was nice for a starting.....,The book I think was good for a starting. I rate this a 4 because it was really boring in the first part but then it got good in the middle and at the end.
4,Cool Book!,"I liked Alice In Wonderland because of the strange ryhmes in the book like ""Will you walk a little faster?"" Also the utter nonsense of the whole story like a dissapearing,grinning cheshire cat. I liked the Queen of Wonderland because she could be so nice one moment & the next she would scream ""OFF WITH HIS HEAD!!!!!"
2,Great story. Bad book.,"I LOVE Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. However, this edition is quite poorly compiled. It really contains the bare minimum of the story. For example, the illustrations are missing. (The author seems to feel they're significant. When the first edition was printed with illustrations with bleedthrough from text on the opposite sides, he recalled every single copy.) One of the poems is missing. There is no table of contents. The formatting is erratic. It would be nice if the book included the typical acknowledgment to Project Gutenberg (which is how this edition came into being) and its small text.I do think it's wonderful that this wonderful story is available at no cost to so many people. However, if you can afford a couple of dollars, I recommend a different edition instead:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (BLTC Press Edition)"
4,Crazy,I never realized how crazy this book is. I feel like I just did drugs or something.... I think I'm going to go do some math homework now...
3,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"I had never read the original, and now I can say I have. It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be."
5,This book is such a wonderful book to read,I chose this book because I saw the movie and it shows her going through lots of adventures and meeting and learning new strange things. I would recommend this book to one of my friends because my friends love adventure and Learning new things.
5,Surfer girl,Interesting almost as s good as the movie.Amazing really fun to read once you have seen the movie at least once.
5,Such an amazing book,This classic is an amazing piece. Lewis Carroll managed to create a whole world of strange yet beautiful things with his quite brilliant imagination. Wonderland is such a brilliant place and I could feel myself there throughout the entire length of the story.
3,Strange,"I quite forget how wild Alice's imagination is. There were times that I wanted to put this book down, but pressed on to the end."
3,Confusing,"This book was good, but I find myself being confused during many parts of the book, especially during the court session and the lobster dance."
5,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,This is a very good classic! I recommend buying this book any day! The overall book is very good and i see no problems with it.
4,Almost Perfect!,"It was just what I wanted, but I really missed the illustrations. Not that easy to read on an iPhone though."
4,interesting book,have not seen the new movie and only remembered bits of the Disney version. Interesting book to say the least.
3,A classic,"Hey, it's Lewis Carrol we're talking about here. Brilliant author. I recommend it as a story both for the father that reads to his child and also for the business man that will not let the kid inside him die."
4,A quaint little story.,"This is a simple story of a girl's travel's into another world. There are no real underlying metaphors or deep philosophical speculation. It's a simple children tale, it's a good story to read to your children."
3,"Beautiful book, but not an easy read","I bought this book for my daughter. This quality of this book tells you that it is meant to be a keepsake. It is very well printed on high-quality paper, beautifully bound, and comes with a hard slipcover. The illustrations are amazing, but I found their style to be a bit dark for my 7-year old. The book is very text heavy, making it cumbersome to read aloud to a child, and a lot of the prose itself is on an adult level. Although my daughter is an excellent reader for her age, she has lost interest in trying to get through this book. I have read it myself, and while it captures the story of Alice in Wonderland nicely, it is, indeed a commitment to get through."
5,The best book I have ever Read!,I loved this book. I have never read it before ...* This book is so amazing that Mrs. Kirkwood Told me to read it to the class.* I was SHOCKED when she said that but I read it and they LOVED the book.SO buy it now and have a ball.
2,Cup half empty,Your cup is under half empty while reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland without the illustrations. In this particular book they are such an important part that the text refers to them.
3,My Reveiw,"it was kind of all over the place, i personally didnt understand it. but i did like the wording, it was helpful(learning wise) and funny"
3,An Okay Book For Four Year Olds,Having read it when I was four it is getting more boring as I get older! It is only good the first time read.
1,long drawn out about nothing,I hated it and thought it was really bad. It was twisted and is really scary to litte childern
4,Review of Alice in Wonderland,After reading this book I was amazed. This is an wonderfultale of an incredable enchanted land and the adventures of a littlegirl in it. Not only is this a great childerns book but I feel thatit is a timly classic for all ages. If you haven't read this book you need to climb out from under your rock and go buy a copy now!
3,"Punny, Non-sensical Tale is a good Read Aloud","Last week I read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll to the girls each night before bed.I'd never read the book before although I've seen several movie versions (who hasn't?). Honestly, I wasn't that impressed. I suppose I thought it would be a typical situation--that the book would be so so much better than the movies. It was fine. It just wasn't as magical as I imagined it would be. The movies are always so visually striking and I thought Carroll's descriptions a bit flat.Obviously, the story is a classic non-sensical tale and it is good. I did especially enjoy the Mock Turtle's puns tales of the sea with slight variations on the words. My daughter enjoyed it. So ultimately, it was worth it."
3,"Classic, for children","Although the story and characters are powerful enough to be remembered after a 20 years hiatus, reading it again as an adult didn't bring anything more interesting than old pictural memories (and I wonder how much praise has to be given to Disney for that). A classic - still modern today - but one better suited for children (as an adult, it made me curious to read an annotated version though, or an essay about different ways to interpret the text's metaphors ; if someone got a suggestion, let me know about it...)"
5,Oldie but goodie!,I've always loved this book as well the movie! Somethings are better left unchanged & this is one of those things.
5,"Fun, entertaining",I thought this would be a fun book to read to pass the time and reflect on the movie that I watched as a child. It was a very short and enjoyable tale. Worth the read.
5,A path to childhood,"This is the story that takes me back in time; never will i cease re-reading it, as those priceless memories give so much joy when Alice takes me back to childhood.Thank you Lewis Caroll."
3,more classic,.it was a freebie. it was a paperless book. why not take advantage of it right? not like WHOA! book!
5,Best book.,It had great details. It was like I was there. I didn't want to put it down. It was awesome.
4,Classic revisited,I thoroughly enjoyed reading Alice as an adult experiencing the duality of Carroll's writing and his wit combined with an easy to read style. A lot of new authors could learn a lot from this book.
3,Review,A classic book and dear to my heart. I must say however that it does go a bit fast and the story is not the same without the pictures in the actual book
3,Alice in wonderland,I love this classic it keeps me entertained. My sister Eli she can hardly look away. However I was a little disappointed that their where no pictures. And the voice that reads for you has no Character at all.
5,Mustard?!!!?,If you like anything about the movie versions its always fun to read where the story came from. Its always better than the movies there is so much more to it and it so easy to read.
3,Good,The problem with seeing the movie before you read the book? You spend the whole time picking up the differences.
3,Very good I loved it,This book is amazing I love it! I would recommend this book for16+.Too long to top it off and the end of the world
4,A great classic,How is it that I'm just reading this book now at age 27? I thought it was great at 27 and can only imagine how much I would have enjoyed it as a child. Wonderfully imaginative!
4,A surprise,"I wasn't sure what to expect. I enjoyed it. It was a surprise. First, it was much shorter than I expected. It wasn't nearly as dark as I expected. And I had no idea how it would end. Much has been written about it and it has been over-analyzed beyond belief. I didn't read any of the commentary on it and don't intend to unless one of you sends me a convincing argument as to why I should.My expectations must have come mostly from the 1951 Disney movie. And I expected a darker movie. Maybe I should see the movie again, as and adult and see if I still think it is so dark.I would encourage you to read it, if you have any interest at all.BTW, the version I read looked different from this one, but I couldn't find it on Goodreads or Amazon. I read it on the iPad ap called ""Free Books."""
5,A classic,I wanted to re-read this and it has been a real treat. So many of the classic novels are disregarded now a days is such a shame.
5,Lovely book,Thank You so much for lovely beautiful book. I was read it in school. And now this book always with me.
5,Another delightful book.,"I have also not read this book lately, but I remember how delighted I was reading this book and being told the story, as a small child (under age 10!)"
3,Down the Rabbit Hole,"Lewis Carrol has thought up a beautiful book with a wonderful storyline. It is about a girl who follows a rabbit wearing a waistcoat and pocketwatch down a rabbit hole when she gets to the bottom she encounters lots of animals, people and cards. The three most famous of them is the Mad Hatter, a person who is very mad, the Queen of Hearts, who has anger problems and the Chershire Cat a cat that can turn parts of its body invisible at will. After a long time she wakes up.This is a book for 3-12 year oldsNOTE There should be some illustrations for this book as it gets a bit dullBy Ashton MattheeAge 1228/12/2011"
2,Incomplete on the Kindle.,"While the story is superb, this version is flawed by lacking the illustrations and by the lack of formatting of the songs and poems. It is surprising how much of the book's richness is lost as a result."
5,The best edition of Alice,"This is my preferred copy of AAIW, and I have several. The quality of the illustrations is superior, because they were made from recently excavated printing blocks. The result is they reveal greater detail than I had seen before, leaving me more impressed than ever with John Tenniel's talent--as if Lewis Carroll's wasn't enough. A beautiful, beautiful book."
2,A magnificent classic. But beware of this KINDLE edition.,"I last read this magnificent book many moons ago (1962) when I had some time on my hands. I was fascinated by the story and the logic inculcated within. So now that I have a Kindle and some time I thought why not read this gem?The book of course is superb. No complaints there. The Kindle edition however is a different matter. There are NO ILLUSTRATIONS as in the hardcopy versions of this book. With a story saturated with visual metaphors this is an unforgivable sin - even though the book is offered for free. Sometimes ""free"" is really NOT free because this version can drive away some of the younger crowd from reading the book. That is the highest of sins."
4,"BBC PRESENTS A WACKY DRAMATIZATION OF ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND"".","Here is another excellent full-cast dramatization from the BBC; with an emphasis on the wacky, surreal aspects of Lewis Carroll's fantasy classic ""Alice In Wonderland."" The sound effects are used to great advantage here; especially whenever Alice (excellently portrayed by Sarah-Jane Holm) eats or drinks anything and changes size; from small to tall and back again. This adaptation even has bottles, cupboards, and food talking back to Alice!This BBC dramatization is likely to leave the listener feeling slightly disoriented; which is precisely how Alice felt in Wonderland. The cast, led by Sarah-Jane Holm, is superb; especially The Caterpiller, The Queen Of Hearts, and The Mad Hatter. As portrayed here, the celebrated Mad Tea Party with Alice, the Mad Hatter, March Hare, and Dormouse almost goes over the edge into total insanity."
3,not that good but good,my daughter thought the book is good but not to good. So I decided to read it and see. When I read it I thought it was pretty good with the details but it was to dramatic and fantasy.But I would recomend it.
3,Crazy confusing but still worth the read,"As most people may know, Lewis Carroll was absolutely freakishly high off of LSD and in reading this book you will have undeniable profit that he was crazy. Very confusing and strange book as well as a anti-climatic ending still a fun read if you have extra time"
5,Alice's Adventure in Wonderland,Wonderful classic novel. Can be read at the level of a child or adult. A commentary on the social and moral values of the time then and now.
5,Good Kindle version,"I can't say anything about the story, it's a classic. But i must say that it was a great adaption for the kindle. I really loved reading it in my kindle."
1,Constant erros with the kindle version,I have to keep flipping back to the non illustrated version because the type is messed up on this version.
2,Alice in wonderland,I really enjoyed this book just the book is not written good it has missing words ex. He was going in a adventure.
3,It is Ok but I was waiting for more,"I though this classic would be able to delight me. However, I just liked it. I recommend it for English students as it has many words that are not usually seen elsewhere."
3,'Drink me.' Said the small bottle.,"This is more of a warning than anything else for the somewhat over excited fans.I bought this without a second thought, I like the publisher, and absolutely always will love the novel and poems in this book.However, THE BOOK IS TINY. I mean it fits in the palm of my hand. And being as jam packed as it is with wondrous things the print is quite small as well. So, simply, buyer beware of that fact that I over looked."
4,Always a pleasant surprise,"I'm always amazed when I finish reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland how I feel like I just read the transcript of a dream.Everything is nonsensical, yet it makes sense; it is all completely fantastical, yet it is told so matter-of-fact that you simply must believe that Alice's adventures were nothing less than fact; the characters are so unbelievable, yet they always seem like old friends. The word structure and usage even reads, and in some cases looks, like a dream. You may not always understand why something happens the way it does to poor Alice, but like the unlikely heroine herself, you simply accept it and move on to the next adventure."
5,all over again,"I have read this book many years ago, I decided it would be nice to read again and it did not disappoint. With a new view point the story read differently. I encourage you to read this book also and see if it still means what you think it did on your first run through!"
4,Wonderful,"This book was astonishing. I had an assignment in school to read the book of "" Alice in Wonderland"". At first I didn't wanted to read it cause i had seen the movie. Later on that day i read the first sentence of the book. It was different from the movie. For example, in chapter one it says Alice was in her sister's bookstore and in the movie it showed she was outside studying. The other example, in the book it seemed she was taking forever falling in the hole and the movie she fall and then landed. So I kept on reading it and in my mind, it wasn't picturing how it is in the movie. I got into more and more each day.There were some big words I won't say or understand. But I reread the sentence and picture how it says it. This is such a wonderful tale to read. Children and adults will enjoy reading the book."
5,Really good book!!!!,I really liked reading the book it was interesting book it was a classic it was also adventures and left me on a hook.Loved it so much!!Thanks Lewis.
4,very entertaining,"I loved it, and I can't wait to read the sequel,Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There"
5,Excellenté!,"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was, as we all know, adapted into a cartoon movie. The movie brought me endless hours of enjoyment as a child, and though Lewis Carroll has a strange writing style, his book has brought me even more entertainment than the movie has. I recommend this book to anyone who likes the ""weird"" stories so to speak and more importantly to anyone who enjoyed the movie quite as much as I did. --Andrew Wayne Gaeta"
2,Good Book. Where Are the Poems and Songs?,"I really enjoyed this book, but why did Amazon feel the need to remove all of the poems and songs? At every point where there was supposed to be one or the other, Amazon just completely deleted it. Really sort of defeated the purpose of the book."
3,A review by The Queen of Hearts,"They should include more of my croquet game. This book did not accurately portray me, and I think someone should write another book. But it's nice to know what happened to that little girl."
3,It is a classic....,"For being free, I would give it a good review. It was nice to read the book again after many years. The kindle edition does not, however, do any justice to the book. Being a children's story, the lack of pictures and opening poem really take away the effects. Because of the lack of physical description, all I could picture while reading it was the movie starring Carol Channing and Sammy Davis Jr. This is one of two books where I can honestly say that the movie was better."
5,the book,alice inn wonderland is a great book for kids ages 8 - 12. i read it and it was like love at first shight. if you have children this would be a good book for them and you.
3,Alright,I got this because I was bored. Only got through the first few pages and didn't like it very much.
1,"Unless it's required reading, skip it","The only redeeming factor about this endless acid trip is putting the literal meaning behind the phrases that have inexplicably wormed their ways into the English language, such as Cheshire grin or ""down the rabbit hole."" I had to read it to keep up with my son's middle school class assignments, and it leaves me wondering why schools would assign books that can turn the kid off to reading altogether."
1,The stolen tarts,"The red queen is scary. She cuts a frogs head off and says"" off with it head"" and that is scary I mean what do you think of the red queen."
3,Not the original illustrations!,"The story is of course the same wonderful one, but I think it's worth mentioning that the original Alice-illustrations that most people remember and love where by John Tenniel, not Gordon Robinson. If you are buying the book for the illustrations, you might be disappointed, Robinson's style is not as detailed."
5,"Easy Read, Very Rewarding","I never realized Alice in Wonderland was such an easy read. It's very simple, and incredibly interesting. Great for family reading and for young readers. I hadn't known that. It's now one f my favorite books."
4,This was interesting to read,"The pictures of the characters are cool. But I thought they change the story a bit and add some different parts, instead of hearing the same lines and speeches again. but I still liked it."
4,A must read,"After all cartoons and movies done, I wanted to read the original story. I found it very interesting and enjoyed it a lot, but sometimes a tough read."
5,love,"awesome part one is amazing but, i have the original unbigided version in hard cover from Barns & Noble which was CHEAP!!! looking forard for the complete tales of Edgar Alan Poe i shall say nevermorep.s. i'm nine"
3,Good read,"This is my first time reading this book at 23. I liked the story a whole and I think it is one all young (or old) people should read. However, I gave it three stars because I didn't have that moment of ""WOW!"" I did enjoy the writing, but I think it very unlikely I'll read it again."
5,Worth a read,Great product worth getting takes you back to your younger days when rabbits talked and daydreaming was allowed at times
3,Good book but confusing,This book is definitely not a children's book. It's pretty confusing even for somebody who loves to read. But all in all its still a classic
2,Not my cup of tea,"I love classic literature to begin with, and so I was sure I would enjoy this book. Well, I enjoyed it to an extent, mainly when Alice was speaking with herself or exploring. But when characters began speaking or interacting with Alice, I was left scratching my head (probably much like Alice.) I'm sorry to the fans of Lewis Carrol, but I did not like Alice Adventure's in Wonderland. Why? Because while there was a protagonist, there really wasn't an antagonist. There was no hardly any plot, no theme, no conflict, and no resolution. There really was no point in Alice's dream. It did not make her a better person. And the characters in the book while amusing, literally had no point. Sorry, but no matter how many cents I have, it will never make enough sense for me. Won't read again."
2,Was it just that Lewis Carroll had a wild imagination?,"I never had any idea where this book was going. I know that in some cases, that may be a good thing, but I'm not so sure it was good in this case. I don't believe that there was much plot at all, nor was there much of a climax. Throughout this whole book, I couldn't help but think to myself that there was something extremely wrong, so to speak, with Lewis Carroll."
1,Alice's adventures in wonderland,This book is good I like it and I been reading it over and over and over again :) yeahh buddy
5,Wow,Lewis Carroll was certainly in wonderland when he wrote this story!!!!!!! I forgot how fun and very confusing it was when I read it so long ago. Still love it!!!
2,You Get What You Pay For,"You already know that this is one of the greatest works of literature, and a must-have for any library. Sadly, this edition lacks John Tenniel's artwork, and it's surprising what a negative impact that makes on the story. Also, for no apparent reason, the prefaces (including the prefatory poem) are not included.Why does this edition exist? Why not just charge us the one dollar up front and save us the disappointment?"
4,Enjoyed the book,"I found Mercy Me to be a delightful, engaging tale that was hard to put down. The characters were well developed and the story interesting. Not the best book I have read this year, but worth reading."
4,A gal I would like to know,"The main character, Esmeralda, is a lady I would like to know. She doesn't have much ""book learning"" but she does have a whole lot of giving heart, her well thumbed copy of the Bible and a book by the famous Christian writer she often quotes. She mistakenly calls him Splurgeon which is funny, and Esmeralda uses words incorrectly to funny effect. She notes that her friend is almost ""historical"" with worry and grief. I enjoy these turns of phrase and how Esmeralda meets each needy person with the best Christian response of ""how can I help you?"". She takes someone with AIDS into her home without a backward glance and works to arrange for an adoption and lots more that I won't share here, so the book will be fresh for you. The mule on the cover has a role to play too. I aim to buy the second book in the series ""Good Heavens""."
1,important but impressionistic,"If you need convincing that the death penalty is a bad idea and you don't care for the academic or philosophical approach, then get this book today. If you want to read a sensitive narrative written to portray what we should already know, then get this book. It's a light read in one sense, full of personal impressions, lovingly crafted to move you. Could be sub-subtitled: One Woman's Journey of Emotion to the Death Row Visitor Box.Describing the prison town in Texas as ""America's killing capital"" puts the whole book in a slippery context. If I weren't from the area I might appreciate it as gruesome gringo modern emo western. But what about America's medical-malpractice capital, armed-murder capital or fetus-killing capital? Not in Texas. And not on this transient author's radar.The topic is important and deserves every book that can be written about it.Further shopping is recommmended."
4,Music Dictionary helps me help others,Most musical terms are included to help me explain them to my grandchildren and church choir members. It is a useful tool for most searching most musical terms.
4,NOT TO BE OVERLOOKED !!!,"Slamming satanic metal they will make you beg for more.Featuring two members of severe torture. With songs like Law of Burning and Let Jesus Bleed will have you taking a crap on your local Pastors lawn. Seriously, though if you like satanic death metal this album is NOT TO BE OVERLOOKED !!!"
3,Entertaining; Hurmorous way of writing,"This book is a really great read if you want to get a feel for Lillian Gilbreth's personality (which is a hurmorous, optimistic personality)or if you want to learn about her family life. But if you're writing a term paper, like I am, and trying just to get facts about her life and not cute stories about the children getting their tonsils out, then this is not the book for you. This is an interesting book, and I would recommend it, just not for the facts it gives you."
4,Shedding light on an Oakland girlhood,"As a city of Oakland resident, interested in 19th century life there, I was very happy to come across this book and read Mrs Gilbreth's childhood memories, visiting Lake Merritt, spending time with cousins, visiting her well to do grandfather at his grand estate (he is known as Oakland's first millionaire). I intend to share it with others I know who share an interest in Oakland's early history."
3,Art from the viewers side,"This is an older book with detailed descriptions and information about a lot of art. Half the pictures are in color. It would make a great reference book. Since it is about 35 years old it probably will cost more to ship it than what you have to pay for it. Great Relaxed reading.Brian Nelsonwww.PartyTentCity.comwww.BrianNelsonConsulting.comhttp://www.Entrepreneur-Mentor.comemsevoldog Houston, TX 77024bnelson@PartyTentCity.com713-467-3025"
5,More please!,"I discovered Muse when they opened for My Chemical Romance in Nashville in April 2007. I was expecting the usual opening band crapfest, and instead got MUSE! How blessed am I? The music was just perfect, and I went right out and got Black Holes and Revelations and Absolution. Initially, I liked BHaR the better of the two, but Time is Running Out just stuck in my brain. Then Sing for Absolution became my favorite song. Then it was Small Print. Then Stockholm Syndrome. Then, forget it, Absolution is my favorite Muse album. Each song is too great for words to do it justice. The lyrics on the album are some of the most lush and romantic ever sang. Honestly, this is one of the best. Just get it and listen for yourself. Just TRY to get Time is Running Out out of your brain! I dare you!"
5,This is the future!,"I was first introduced to Muse by their song ""Time is Running Out"", which was awesome. They have an explosive sound, and have something that is needed in today's hip-hop dominated world. People continously compare them to Radiohead, which bugs me since it gives people the impression that they are just copycats.All the rock I have listened to lately has sounded like the same mass produced garbage that has been circulating these past two years or so. Muse is by no means unorignal, except to those who are in so much love with Radiohead that they want to make them sound importantby saying that Muse is stealing their sound.Muse is great, listen to them because they are bringing to the planet that which hip-hop and new prissy rock bands aren't, good music."
3,nooooooooooo,"I joined the muse camp at origin of symmetry, and after the initial delight of this album had worn off I found myself realising that while this is a good album, all of the musical progress is so forced and unnatural it sounds nothing like them playing at their best on their first two albums...Don't get me wrong, theres some great songs on here- the only terrible one is the dire 'endlessly', but as a package it falls sadly short of the mark.In the meantime, listen to some radiohead or smashing pumkins... it's essentially the same message.(although I have seen them live and their new songs should make a good next album release)"
4,Pretty good,This CD is what you call an acquired taste. You have to listen to it several time before you start to say hey these British guys are pretty good. Its an all around good CD
3,(starsailor + verve) x the bends = meh,"not bad, not brilliant - it's been done before, but this one shoots for even grander heights, deeper lows, and more overwrought angst than previous entries. if i was radiohead i'd not be too worried, they're miles beyond this now. perhaps worth a been-there-done-that smirk or two. Well worth the coin to see them live, however"
5,AWESOME,Move over RadioHead - you've met your match. This band is amazing. I love Stockholm Syndrome and Time is Running Out. Melodic Harmonies....LOVE IT!!!!
3,gasping lead singer,"I like some of Muse's songs and I don't like others. But a MAJOR detractor for me is the lead singer's gasps in between each line he belts out in his crazy (but distinctive) falsetto. Other singers can manage to breathe off the mike or whatever, what is up with this guy? Is it just a vocal technique issue? It's very distracting--I can't even hear the music for all the breaths he gasps: ""La la la GASP! la la la GASP!""Watch, now that you are listening for it, you won't be able to ignore it!"
5,One of the greatest albums ever!!,"This was the album that changed everything that I thought I knew about music. I had heard Hysteria and thought that's a pretty cool song. That same day I went and bought Absolution and was blown away.I had never in my life imagined music could be so great. Sure I'm a huge fan of Pink Floyd and of course Zeppelin, and trust me MUSE is in the same category as these greats.For anyone thinking about maybe getting this album, don't think just do it. And while you're at it pick up all the rest. Everything MUSE does is absolute gold."
4,Muse,"With the radio hit "" Time is Running Out"" Muse proves yet again how original they are. They have created a genre of there own, borderlining between rock and an almost orchastra/ electronica type sound. Absolution contains mainly lyrics centering around the disoray of the world, with songs such asApolocolypse Please( Declare this an emergency, go on and sell a sense of urgency....)Hysteria( Cuz I wantt it now, I want it now, give me your heart and your soul..)I could ( and have) listened to this c.d for hours, I would highly recomend it, espesially to fans of Queen, or Radiohead."
5,Incredible,This is one of the most amazing bands in the world. This a CD that everyone should own. I just saw them last night at the Metro and it was the best show I've ever seen in my life. They are so dynamic and exciting live. They rock out like no other.
5,Top album of 2004,Bought this album just for the heck of it a few years ago. Never heard Muse before. What an amazing album.. Every song has it's own groove and feel to it. It's like riding a rollercoaster of greatness.
5,Completely amazing,"Every single song on this cd is amazing! They are all deep, emotionally charged, and beautiful. You can feel the emotion as you listen to them. Completely breathtaking. Muse is one of the best bands ever created. This cd only adds to that."
3,got fear?,"I don't know why people think they have to stick up for musicians and artists. Let the music stand on its own, and listen on your own accord. It's not a damn competition. Everyone's insecure about music they didn't even create-how silly is that? Anyway, the effort is a good one and the energy is there..it's enjoyable for sure-so if you can find it in yourself to just accept it for what it is, you'll not likely have qualms."
4,Holy Crap! A three piece sound trample!,"If there were a war between muse and all the crappy, whiney, pop-metal b-crap, there would be three musicians left. Three victorious men overlooking a field of smoldering teenage almosts. This is MUSE. Buy this album or your not cool. Trust me, we can tell. Mozart on speed, heading North on 1st Ave doing eighty."
1,Let's not kid ourselves,"Let's just say it and be done with it.Muse was not inspired by Radiohead.....Muse IS radiohead, at least they think they are.My god, everytime this comes on I have to double check it because I just can't believe Radiohead is not in this band somewhere. They get 1 star because there is no originality here....none.If you like Radiohead, you might like Muse. You see, I love Radiohead, but I hate this rip-off band with a passion because there is absolutely nothing new or different from Radiohead here. Don't bother looking.I guarantee one thing though, those who like Muse, also like Radiohead."
1,mmm...not so good...,"I read a couple reviews from this album and thought it was going to be a rendition of a Radiohead album mixed with some Coldplay and Queen...but it is far from. If you are looking for good music, do NOT get this album. Radiohead is being degrated when people compare this band to them. This album sucks. theres a bunch of whining and music beats that are ones i've heard before just with some screaming or singing in the back. Nothing was good on this album and no one should get this. take heed to my warning. please!"
1,One word: Radiohead,Muse is BLATANTLY derivative of Radiohead. If you don't mind their complete lack of originality and long for a watered-down version of the source material.........knock yourselves out with Muse.They should be ashamed to have ripped off another artist's sound and sensibility so obviously.Just another example of the sad state of affairs in the music industry.
4,"Singular, albeit brooding effort","Time Is Running Out and Hysteria are undoubtedly the two best tracks on Absolution. I bought it based upon these two stellar songs, yet these two powerful and invigorating songs are hardly a microcosm of the entire album. While the CD is solid, replete with incredibly introspective lyrics (e.g. Endlessly & Ruled By Secrecy) and intense guitar work(Hysteria, The Small Print, and Stockholm Syndrome come to mind), it can be a little draining at times with the seemingly indefatigable over-the-top brooding emotion from Matthew Bellamy on almost every song.That being said, it's an undeniably solid effort - just not something I could listen to every day like a Franz Ferdinand. With lyrics like ""Your death creates success rebuild and suppress"" from Ruled by Secrecy, I'm sure you can understand why."
5,Moving,"After hearing this band the first time, I was struck by the vocal similarities of Matt Bellamy to Thome York, but that's where the similarities ended. This album is simply a brilliant musical achievement. Don't get me wrong I am a huge Radiohead fan, but I believe that Radiohead has lost their sense of creativity since OK computer. All the albums from then on have been unique to the point of sounding too experimental, and have drifted away from Rock. Muse represents a mixed bag of classical instruments, elctronic sounds, and most of all rock.I know this is a Muse review and I hate mentioning another band but Radiohead could take a lesson from Muse and stop producing post-human electronic records and simply stick to Rock n' Roll like they did in the Bends."
4,Best offering yet.,"Big, epic, sweeping, dramatic, it will suck you in and never let you go. This album is a must-have if you even only slightly like Muse."
3,exciting new rock,"I thought I'd be all original and compare them to Radiohead, but seems a lot of people on here have beat me to it / lolAnyway, Muse is awesome, definitely like a more rockin', less subtle version of Radiohead, and I actually like them better. 'Stockholm Syndrome' is an excellent track and will give you an idea of how energetic and bad-ass these guys can be. Maybe it's not for strict hard-rock people, but fans who like variety should get into Muse."
3,"Good maybe, but not 4.5 stars","Wanted to like this album. Had heard them compared to radiohead. Heard a few of their songs from previous records and liked not loved them. I just find though I like the singer's voice, I'm not as excited about the music or production.Some good songs like ""Time is Running out"" and ""Hysteria"" but also several not so exciting songs. Decent but I think maybe I'll have to go back and check out earlier stuff."
5,BUY THIS CD NOW,"My friend lent me a burnt copy of this cd back in April of 2004. I listened to it all the way through and thought ""Ok.. Not bad"" but after listening ot it again, I feel deeply DEEPLY In love with the band and their songs. You have to let some of them grow on you, but once you do, you can't get enough of them. I have heard the album at least one hundred times since April and I consider myself a newly obsessed Muse fan member. Since Absolution, I have acquired Showbiz, their first album, Hulaballo, an album of theirs released in the UK (including Live tracks) and Origin of Symmetry. I love all their songs. People ocmpare them to radiohead, but it is unfair. They are ridiculously talented. So buy this cd. Right now. I promise you you will not regret it; I have yet to meet a person who does not like Muse."
5,great album,"I hate to continue the radiohead comparisons, but picture a harder-hitting bends era radiohead with some classical and even a little techno inspiration. A great mix of styles."
5,what an album,"I was told of this band from my older brother saying that they sound like Radiohead, but haevier. I never could get into Radiohead, but these guys are amzing. Tight vocals, complex rhythms, and just a powerful, strong sound. They may sound a little like Radiohead, but I think they are a little more approachable than Radiohead, and I would much rather listen to them.Overall though, this album has quickly become one of my more favorite new releases. At last a new album that I can say that I enjoy."
5,Wonderful,"Just seen Muse live in Vancouver 10/04/2004...fantastic. I have been a fan since the first album and Muse are getting better and better, defying critics who saw them as a Radiohead clone. This is a superb album in it's genre, it excites me, it brings out emotions in me, it rocks me. UK music has been spoiled by all this poop(that's what I call it)idol crap and manufactured boy/girl bands...it's just great that we have a band that can actually play brilliant music and have genuine talent...oh and by the way there is room in this world for Radiohead and Muse...and I am sure both bands would agree too!!"
5,ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE!!!,"IVE NEVER HEARD A MORE INCREDIBLE ALBUM BY THIS BAND. I WAS COMPLETLY BLOWN AWAY, AND EVEN CRIED LISTENING TO THIS IMMENSELY TALENTED BAND. MATTHEW BELLAMY HAS A BEAUTIFUL HARMONIUS UNIQUE VOICE THAT MAKES ME WANT TO GO OUT AND CHANGE THE WORLD... ANYONE WHO WOULD SHUN THIS BAND, HAS NO MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE OR HEART. LISTENING TO MUSE IS GUARANTEED TO GIVE U GOOSEBUMPS, SHIVERS, AND TEARS OF JOY. I CANT BELIEVE WHAT AN IMPACT THIS BAND HAS HAD ON MY LIFE. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, AND BUY THIS ALBUM, U WILL DEFINATELY NEVER LOOK BACK. ALSO RECOMMENDED BANDS: TOOL, A PERFECT CIRCLE, RADIOHEAD, NIRVANA, ONE SIDE ZERO, ALICE IN CHAINS, THE SMASHING PUMPKINS, AND FLOYD.ALL HAIL TO THE ALMIGHTY MUSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Great album, but very unoriginal","The first full track, Apocolypse Please, blew me away. I heard some Radiohead similarities, but not enough to make me think I was listening to a Radiohead album. However, as the CD went on, I forgot I was listening to Muse. In fact, it sounds like it could be a Thom York side project. On the other hand, every single track is incredibly well crafted and will certainly have your head bouncing. Also, despite the Radiohead comparisons, there's a few differences. The music is very heavy at times and almost sounds like a full orchestra with distortion. Piano is well placed throughout the CD and adds a nice classical touch. If it weren't for Radiohead, I would give this album 5 stars, but since the music is too similar, I had to take one off."
3,not very unique are they,Of course people compare this band to radiohead it does sound like b sides to the bends but acutally the b sides to the bends are alot better and more interesting. This singer needs to know that there are more singers out there than Jeff Buckley and Tom Yorke. The music all sounds the same with the pounding of the piano and guitars. It seems to me that the piano player on this cd just does not know how to play the dam thing with the exception of butterflies and hurricanes i like the piano interlude it sounds like liberace. So if this band does not want to be think of as a radiohead clone they should experiment more and try to develop a sound that is all there own i know that can be hard. Come on really is there any band out today that sounds original or different from what is on the radio. I would sell this cd on amazon but it is not worth munch with the cost of the bubble mailer and shipping the dam thing it is just not worth it.
2,Nothing in prior acheivements,"Absolution tarnishes the Muse name. They once stood as one of the most amazing, phenominal, emotional acts around, but now have resorted to pop based androgonous rock.Stockholm Sydnrome stands as a testament to TRUE muse, with Apocalypse please following almost. However songs such as Thoughst of a dying athiest & hysteria stray from the godly emotion withheld in Matthew Bellamy, and with Sing for absolution, it virtually destroys the album.Very dissapointing."
2,Disappointing....,"Well I must say this came as a surprise. For some reason Muse have decided to take the one bad track from OoS , Megalomania, and base most of their new album on it. Couple of good tracks aside (TPS, Stockholm Syndrome), the rest is very much a step backwards for the band. Far too much pompous noodling with strings and pianos, and even Matt's vocals seem more annoying then before. I know others have said this album shows Muse to be growing as a band, but anyone who loved OoS be warned: this is drastically different from that masterpiece and not in a good way. Sad."
2,Haven't I Heard This Sound Before???,"This English trio is a Radiohead imitator--which is fine, of course. There's room on the bus for groups that can mimic another's sound if they can pull it off (ELO's Beatlesesque pop and the Feelies' Velvet Underground-charged tunes come to mind). However, Muse, unlike Radiohead, doesn't temper their progressive rock obsession with art school know-how. Whereas Thom Yorke and company believe--whether it's true or not is another question--that they are reinventing progressive rock for a post-punk generation, the guys from Muse define retrogradation. Not recommended.For more reviews, visit http://unpaidrockcritic.typepad.com"
2,Absolute mistake,"I was trying to work the album title into.... Ah, Forget IT! I had heard part of ""Apocalypse Please"" or whatever it is in a coffee shop, and I was intrigued. Upon buying the album, I listened to one or two tracks and laid it to rest. I was sorely disappointed to the mediocrity of the album as a whole. The album did not grab me. Think of me as one of the things flying overhead on the album cover. Nothing about this album was overly enjoyable, or should I say a""MUSE""ing in the least."
3,What the Fluck?,"I was watching late night Sunday television the other night and I came across an infomercial for these guys. It was quite a welcome surprise because the only other show on was reruns of X-Files. Any way I spent the next twenty or so minutes under the mistaken belief that this was Radio Head and the members of the band had under gone expensive appearance altering surgical operations. In the world of music, you have to deal with whatever's already out there. It's okay to be influenced by a great band; however, these guys are just totally/blatantly ripping off Radio Head. The sad thing is that even though they're ripping them off they sound even better than Radio Head. They probably could write some really good original music if they wanted to."
2,Ugh,"Yes, I'm not gonna deny that the singer has a great voice. And the band plays very well. But I also liked them back in 1993 when they were called RADIOHEAD!Come on guys, be a little original! Don't waste that voice trying to imitate someone! Do your own thing, I'm usre it'll work out fine.I'm giving them an extra star because of their ability, but I'm feeling VERY generous!"
5,Bought it on Vinyl,You can read the other reviews if you want to hear how AMAZING Muse is. I'm going to skip that and just talk about my purchase.I went for the vinyl pressing and couldn't be happier. It came in 180gram audiophile quality with a book-style disc jacket. The lyrics to each song are printed artistically on the inner pages of the jacket.
4,Absolution,"A wonderful album, anyone who thinks they may even be interested in Muse should check it out."
5,My thoughts on Muse,"I'll preface these thoughts by stating that I am a long-time Radiohead fan who thinks that no band in existence has done as much as Thom Yorke and the boys to broaden the spectrum of rock music. With that said, Muse, while sounding much like Radiohead, goes places that Radiohead could never dream of going. While Radiohead has exhibited nearly endless musical genius and ability to reinvent themselves, they simply lack the technical expertise that Muse displays on their albums. Muse integrates intricate classical piano lines, hard-hitting, technically-perfect guitar playing, and incredible, never-off-key vocals. Their lyrics are probably more accessible than Radiohead's as well. Absolution, as an album, is the best of Muse's work to date. The songs here show depth in their lyrics and production. If you like hard-hitting, melodic rock music, this is definitely something you should check out."
4,"Great, great album!!!","So I downloaded this song from this chick who tells me that it is an advanced song from Radioheads new cd ""Telephasic"" and after listening to it, Im thinking Radiohead is getting heavy all of a sudden. I was really digging what I was hearing and i see a video for Muse's single and I was taken aback. This whole time Im thinking Radiohead has done it again, and it was Muse. ""Absolution"" is an amazing disc from beginning to end. There is no doubt that he sounds like Yorke, but there is something more behind his voice and after listening through a couple of times, you realize that Muse has a style all their own. ""Butterflies & Hurricanes"" and ""Sing for Absolution"" are standout tracks to me, but really, they are all good. Definitely worth picking up on this because if this disc doesnt make them big, the next one will. I saw them for 5 dollars a week ago, so you can still catch them before they hit."
4,Muse!!!!!,"After listening to ""time is Running out"" on the radio (of course their hit here in America) i decided to check out the band's music. I Instantly fell in love! I love how they mix nice classical piano with rock! this Cd is very nice. A lot of Slow emotional songs and wonderful lyrics. yet still outstanding. If you want more of the rock and mixture i reccomend what is probably their best Cd yet. ""Origin of Symmetry"" New Born and PLug In Baby are the singles from it---awesome songs! horray for Muse!"
4,Muse Rocks... Classically,"Sure, you can hear Radiohead and other influences in this album. But whose album have you ever heard that hasn't had some influence? I think a lot of their sound is orginal. They're original because they have taken about 5 different styles and molded it together to make their own. I remember a little band named Stone Temple Pilots that people thought was a Pearl Jam rip-off. I listen to it today and can't hear a single bit of PJ. So the point is listen to this Muse album more than once and you can tell it is the Muse, not Radiohead or any other."
4,"The ""Spinal Tap"" of Radiohead","Among this slew of bands that sound ""like Radiohead"", most of them unwisely (in my opinion) travel the plain Coldplay Travis route. Muse... doesn't. Most of the tracks have a hard rock minor key urgency like Iron Maiden and Freddie Mercury are chasing them, trying to give them an enema of boiling water.I'm sure there could be some good lyrics in there, but I haven't heard a word yet, and I don't want to ruin the rock-out buzz I've got here."
3,In what way are they not a radiohead rip-off?,"This is a good cd. The only difference between this album and a radiohead album is that a radiohead is obviously much better. And there is a bit more heavy guitar nonsense that you wouldn't find on a radiohead album; but other than that and thom yorke's vocals there is no difference. A casual radiohead listener might even mistake certain tracks for radiohead material. So it is ok, but definitely radiohead influences so don't try to kid anybody that they have their own sound."
5,aural ecstasy,"absolutely un F#!*ing believable. Yes there are hints of radiohead but who cares, thats an unbelievable compliment if you're being compared to radiohead. Muse is like you took radiohead, queen and everything that was any good about 80's guitar rock and rolled it into one incredible package. Beautiful, powerful and astonishing."
3,It's Ok,"I'm sure this magazine is a hit with many but it's just not my favorite. I wanted to try it out though and see. I'm more of a southern, country type magazine gal who likes lots of recipes. This isn't a bad magazine just not my style personally. I've only receive one issue so far so maybe it will grow on me more after I get another issue or two."
3,Magazines,Cannot really reveiw magazines until the subscription has started. E-mail me is 6-8 weeks for a review.Good Housekeeping [1-year subscription]Good Housekeeping [1-year subscription]
2,Too much advertising,"This magazine really lacks in content for the intelligent woman.Sorry, but I tire of reading the same ol same ol every month."
3,So-so,I bought the subscription for my 91 yr. old mother. She said the magaince is thin and geared toward younger women. Will not be renewing.
3,how i love myself,I think this moving told me alot about my sexual preference and how watching porn can help me examan my own sexuality and not take it out on other people...
2,A dreadful read,"I really enjoyed Bones of the Master, but I regret to say that this book is awful. It reads like a 16 year old's diary--unbearably self-centered and self-absorbed, given to inane philosophizing and adolescent romanticism. It is somewhat astonishing that a sixty-something year old man has managed to abide at such a stage of arrested development. He may have inadvertently succeeded in his quest for literary recognition by writing what will one day be considered the definitive document of baby boomer narcissism and selfishness. I suppose it was the presence of Tsung Tsai that made Bones of the Master engaging, because without it the author is adrift."
1,Possibly the most self-absorbed book I have ever read,"It is difficult to believe this is the same George Crane that penned ""Bones of the Master."" I can only believe the Fox has taken his soul along with his ability to tell a compelling story.If you want to read about sex and drugs, I suggest Hunter S. Thompson or Charles Bukoski. If you want to read about Zen, see Robert Pirsig.If you want to be bored, buy this book.Sorry, I loved ""Bones of the Master,"" but this author has lost his muse and seems proud of it."
1,Truly Awful..,"If you want to read a disjointed account of random journeys this is your book.If you want your writer to be an old man who writes, thinks and acts like a 15 year old child (and not a child in the 'zen' sense) who's just seen Porky's, this is your book.If you want a book that sounds as though it's written by a recovering alcoholic and sex addict who hasn't quite gotten the 'recovery' part and has somehow returned to middle-school humor (the bad kind, not the childlike wonder kind) and innuendo..This is your book.I don't know if the author is suffering from some kind of brain disorder or suffered a series of strokes since his first book, but this one is truly awful.Get it at the library, but get ready to set it down out of disgust and disappointment. Putting 'Zen' anywhere in/on this book is a disgrace to 'Zen' practice."
5,A wonderful adventure,"I see that some reviewers were not impressed with Crane's eagerly anticipated sequel. I must confess that I was! For one thing, the absence of Tsung-Tsai is not as glaring as some have suggested. His spirit is still very much with Crane; it's simply that Crane has, in some sense, moved on from being a disciple to becoming his own man. I, for one, think the title reflects this. Secondly, the prose in the sequel is far superior to that of the original. Is Crane self-indulgent? Of course! But that's the point! Crane, like a true Zen master, is detached from his own behaviour, and views it with an ironic sort of amusement. Above all, Crane's novel serves as an indictment of the holier-than-thou Buddhists and other saints who are incapable of simply appreciating life for what it is. And for that, we ought to be grateful."
5,...The Absolutly Amazing...,"This cd is jawdropping. Literally. North Carolina never had a music scene until jamie king (swifts drummer). This cd is amazing. Metal as hell, soft as a baby's bottom...this cd doesnt dissapoint. Buy this cd or kick your own ass."
5,A book like candy (read it with love),"Perfect, absolutly perfect. Just like Dharma Bums, I had to take my time reading this book because every WORD is so important. Kerouac is a god."
5,The Road to Ruin,"Let me tell you a story. I had just come down toSan Francisco after a couple of years of bummingaround the Great Northwest. It was a Monday morningand I had picked up a newspaper; bound and determinedto scour the want ads until I found prospects for anhonest job, with the full intention of becoming morerespectful. I went to a cafe in North Beach and had aseat at one of the outdoor tables. As I began to unfoldthe newspaper, I noticed that someone had left a copyof ""Desolation Angels"" on the chair. I picked it up andstarted to read it. Several hours later I abandoned myfaint tries at redemption and walked over to WashingtonSquare to work on some poetry. The man can flat out write.That's why they call him the King of the Beats."
5,My First Kerouac,"This book actually made me dizzy: fast paced, crazy, emotional, funny, crude and touching. I've never read anything like it. Kerouac reels you into his life, mind and heart. I'm hooked."
3,A Trifle Over-Rated,"For some readers who found this book after reading some of Kerouac's more conventional literary works, this novel may come off as a bit tedious. Kerouac wasn't that great an experimental novelist, or at least not as graceful with spontaneous prose and extra-sensory perceptive description as his pier William S. Burroughs, as exemplified by the book's more incoherent and often undermanaged meanderings. As a piece of creative autobiography, however, the novel is a symbolic giant of originality, fearlessly defying traditional literary convention and organization. For those seeking out Kerouac for more traditional entertainment, however, the novel proves far more complex than a single reading may warrant."
5,What a great 2-part episode to watch,"Finally Mulder and Cryzeg together again against the ""Black cancer."" Cryzeg losing his left arm? Freaky. If you love the intensity of the 'files' you'll find this pack hard to resist."
1,wahl clipper,This clipper was not suitable for my long-haired Dachshund. It pulled and did not come close to doing a good job.
4,Works for people too!,"I actually bought this item to cut my children's hair. My uncle once recommended pet clippers because they are more durable. I had an earlier version of these Wahl clippers many years ago. When I needed to replace them, I couldn't find this precise rechargeable product and wasted a lot of money on ""salon"" clippers in the interim. I'm glad to be back with clippers that actually hold their charge, do the precise trimming, and make maneuvering easy because they're cordless."
4,Wahl Clippers- Suitable for their purpose,"Although a bit bulkier than I expected. THese clippers work great. Good for both long and short hair breeds. The battery/ cord options are wonderful, although the battery charge holds no longer than 30-40 minutes. Would still recommend."
2,Great clipper with bad battery life,"I purchased these clippers approx 2 years ago. They are excellent clippers i.t.o ergonomics, cutting performance - the stainless blades work great and the clipper is relatively quiet. The clipper does not overheat. My concern is the poor battery life - mine is now dead after 2 years and I have to buy new clippers. I would have given these clippers a 5 star if I reviewed it a month after purchase, but 2 years from now they are useless. No, the plug in feature does not work - you can not run on AC power only if the battery is dead. The AC only works with the battery somewhat charged."
1,awful... do not buy,I bought these because the reviews at the time were good for these clippers. They are not good at all! I have a Westie and I do not let her hair get too long. These clippers couldn't handle just the little bit of hair I was trying to trim. The blades on the clippers seem as though they may be very dull from the start. DO NOT BUY!!!
4,Trimming a gargantuan Maine Coon Cat,"So far so good! I bought the pet clipper after I read the reviews that said it was a very quiet trimmer. I wanted to give it a go on my two Maine Coon cats who were in need of a trim (because try as I might, I can't prevent a few little matted spots from creeping up once a year). My two cats have very different personalities. One is adventurous and the other is more cautious. The adventurous cat totally tolerated (if not actually enjoyed) his first trim! He looks sassy with his homemade lion cut:) So I'm very happy about that. So far, the cautious cat has run away every time I try to sneak in for a trim, but I'm hopeful she will learn to tolerate it as well because her brother (the adventurous one) is really enjoying his new hairdo!"
4,Not as quiet as advertised,"Bought this product because it was advertised as being very silent in operation so as not to frighten the pet being groomed. Just as noisy as a normal shaver but luckily my dog was not afraid and allowed me to groom him. For those with pets who are afraid of the buzz from shavers, this is not recommended. Ease of operation because it is cordless.Highly recommend this site for quality Wahl products."
1,Warning::Clippers won't stay charged.,"My clippers only lasted 3 times, less than one summer. I tried to contact Wahl's but they won't return my email. What a waste of money. I charged the clippers and they don't work. If I kept it plugged in they work. But the cord is too short. So, I'm out of clippers back to scissors."
2,Not so powerful motor but convenient cordless,"When I read reviews that these clippers were powerful enough for a smooth cut, I was excited to try them out. If you're looking to cut a more hair-like coat, I suggest you look elsewhere.I purchased this for my Lhasa mutt who gets clipped short. This thing would pull on his hair and just clip some of the hair that comes through the comb. What results is an uneven coat of patchy looking hair. Even with no attachment any amount of hair would make the motor work and not perform up to par.Also the short little tips of hair that did get clipped would collect at the base of the blades and build up, causing even worse performance. I had to keep clearing the blades of hair after just a few strokes.Needless to say, these are getting shipped right back to the warehouse."
3,Very Warm Clippers,"After spending > $70 to get two small dogs groomed each time I visit a major Pet Market, I decided to get clippers to do the job myself. Though I'm still trying to get the hang of clipping areas like joints, around the ears, face, etc, the clipper is fairly easy to use. It's quiet. I like it...but my dogs to a lesser degree when I'm cutting around the face.The major issue with this clipper is that it gets very warm after 10-15 minutes of use. Fortunately, the plastic thingamajig that goes over the metal keeps it from burning the dogs. The metal gets hot to the touch.Other than that, it's quite a neat little clipper."
1,Lack of specifications,Product Details or full specifications should indicate the voltage rating of the battery charger.Supplying a 120 Volt charger to Australia is useless. Aussie buyers beware.
1,Way too loud & noisy,"Super disappointed with this product. It hurts my hand to hold the clipper because it vibrates so much. My concern is that if it hurts when it's holding against my hand, how much does it hurt my dog when I trim him. The motor is loud and noisy that scares my 5 year old maltese who usually doesn't have problem with me trimming him with my previous clipper. DEFINITELY WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN."
5,Great Value,"Great clipper, easy to clean, great grooming kit, replaceable blade. I did a lot of research before buying this clipper and for the home user with one dog it is perfect!!!!"
2,Only lasts 10 minutes before dying,I was very happy with the quitenes of this clipper but the battery life is too short. I can only use it for 10 min after 24 hr recharging period.
1,Waste of money,"i bought these clippers for my first shih tzu and they worked fine, however when i had my second shih tzu, with a thicker coat they would not work. i sent the blades off to the manufacture to be sharpened. however even after being sharpened they still would not cut her hair. i woud not recommend at all."
1,Waste of Money,"I've had issues with this clipper since I bought it. This is the same one that horse supply catalogs offer.The battery only lasts one muzzle and a maximum of four fetlocks before it dies. You can't run it off of the power cord, you have to recharge it a minimum of 24 hrs before each use which is a MASSIVE pain, especially right before a show. Clippers are supposed to be convenient, not something I need to plan for!It never held charge for very long but now it only lasts one minute before dying. I've kept it immaculately clean with oiling, cleaning, etc. between uses.Wahl's white case clippers have traditionally been refurbishments - that should tell you something about how reliable they are - they've made an entire product line out of bad products!Save your money and don't buy this thing."
4,Good but not Kamelot's best,"This CD is good, BUT...if your a fan of their last several CD's this album can disappoint. Kamelot has not been Nickelback or Creed. This album tends to be more poppy, the guitars are a little more buried to the sound effects. It lacks some of the power and aggression of the last several releases. It still has some catchy tunes and good writing, but not quite the raw power of Karma or The Black Halo. I was hoping for more songs like ""Momento Mori"" or ""Karma"". It's just not on this album. It reminds me of Queensryches Promised Land...Sort of searching for identity...You may disagree..its a good CD, just not as passionate as previous releases to me..."
1,Moving towards the wrong side of the tracks...,"I've been reading the reviews for this album and I have to say I think it's amazing how many people think that this album is good. I think it is the worst album by far. It sounds like Kamelot was so eager to get the attention of teeny goths that they forgot their true fans. This album is so disappointing that it makes me sad. It's not ""Kamelot"" and that's the whole reason that we buy their cd's. It's okay to sound different, but this kind of different is NOT good. If you are interested in power metal check out any of Kamelot's albums BUT this one."
4,Too bombastic... but effective.,Kamelot should write Epic movie soundtracks...I use their music for the most dramatic moments when roleplaying (A Steampunk-Detective Raveloft version)
3,OK,The overall musicianship is ok. The vocals are the real stand out. My biggest issue with the CD is that I feel the sound is too compressed and it seems a bit over produced. Reminds me of Geoff Tate trying to do a rock orchestra but without the top quality guitar work. But then again we all know what opinions are like :)
4,Soo good!,"I loved this albumm, it is one of Kamelot's biggest projects to date, as they have said it would be, but there was something small that caused it to not surpass their black halo album. It took me a while to realize what it was, but then it hit me, something so obscure yet it was sticking out there in front of my sensitive ears. This album was almost a softer metal compared to the Black Halo. The writing was very well done, but some tracks kind of felt incomplete. Their creativity is still very strong and the work that was put into it was very good.Key tracks are 3,4 and 11. 12 If you get the bonus track which is definitely worth a listen.A worthy album with some very beautiful songs."
2,Missed their mark!,"Songs seem very repetitive. Also, has some rip-off ""Phantom"" music to create the ghostly effect. Khan needs to stop with the attempt at soft singing. His vibrato kills all of the ballad style singing and his voice sounds way over trained. I am all about great vocals and this album does a poor job of showcasing them. Khan can sing better than this. Lose the heavy vibrato. I am a Kamelot fan but the album left me wanting more. Maybe next time guys."
3,"Its good, i think","This is such a change for kamelot, and usually i love when bands change, see my review for Sonata Arctica's Unia but this is very weird....i can't even describe the album....i love the first song, not the intro so i guess track number 2 and a couple others but overall its def the worst Kamelot album in a long time..."
3,Satisfying at FIRST,"I love Kamelot, I really do. However, in my unbiased opinion, this album isn't as good as the others.The album starts off good, and it has a lot of good jingles that will get you hooked, however the problem is that these jingles get old fast, after about 9 listens you'll want to move on as soon as possible.Some of the songs on this album could have been better but were just toned down, such as Blücher. The lyrics are great, however the song is very mellow and only serves to put this reviewer to sleep.One of the main problems I had was the studio cut songs, I personally would have liked the album better if they switched the songs ""Blücher"" and ""Mourning Star"" with ""Seasons End"" and ""Pendulous Fall"" while putting prologue at the end as intended."
5,It really works!,"I've followed the advice in this book for numerous trips to Japan and Korea. It really works - I rarely have trouble with jet lag. The advice they give is not gimmicky or based on folklore. It's a matter of changing your behavior and diet a few days before you leave, and during the initial adjustment. Especially important is start acting like you're on destination time as soon as you get on the plane - just the opposite of what the airlines do. The authors explain about what is actually going on it your body as it tries to adjust. I've found their method is simple, easy and understandable."
1,Nightmare,"Purchased this item in part for the ""constant on"" feature in which the remaining lights stay lit if one bulb goes out. The string was in place for roughly 24 hours and I arrived home to find 3/4 of the string out. I tried in vain to adjust the nonfunctioning bulbs to get the string to light. I'm now left with useless trash which, I suppose, I will bundle up and send back to Amazon. Absolutely worthless product and especially galling in light of the ""constant on"" claim, which is absolutely fraudulent."
1,irreplaceable junk,"They sell these as stand-alone or in their pre-lit trees. Either way, they have a ""current-limiting bulb"" per string that functions as an in-line fuse. When this burns out (which it frequently does), you are punked. It's not replaceable. Brilliant bit of planned obsolescence."
1,DO NOT BUY GE CONTANT ON LIGHTS/PRELIT TREE!!!!,"These lights burn out quickly! They are plain junky. Every 50th light bulb has a ""fuse bulb"" (marked by a white casing the bulb connects into)that is GLUED into the socket. Once it burns out, the section of lights between it and the next fuse bulb will go completely out. It is not intended to be replaced by the user and does not have an available replacement part. If you try to take the bulb out, it ends the warranty. If this bulb goes out (and it will much sooner than it should)and your warranty is over or you messed with the fuse bulb, you are out of luck. You are not going to be able to fix or replace it. This product is a complete waste of money."
1,String a long Lights did not stay on,"I read in the description that if one light either burned out or became loose, the other lights would stay on. I specifically bought this product based on the description. Well guess what happen. One bulb must have become loose and 50 of the 100 lights went out. Is there a set of these miniature lights that will stay on. This brand will not."
2,Not as good as they used to be.,"Disappointed in the GE product of xmas lights that are sold these days. I never had a problem with them over the years, they lasted for multiple holiday years without having to replace them. The last two years I've had to buy new each year because one or two strands would burn out before xmas. Same thing this year, bought three new strands and the one in the center of the tree burned out xmas morning when the tree lights were turned on. Will never buy this product again, very disappointed. They are NOT ""constant on"" lights either, half a strand will burn out or three quarters of the strand or the entire thing, awful quality in recent years. Do not recommend at all."
1,Say No to GE Pre-Lit Trees and Lights!,"Purchased a GE pre-lit tree with C-5 constant on lights. All GE pre-lit trees are on the expensive side, but beautiful trees. The lights worked a couple of weeks, then part of a set went out. With a thousand other things on my mind, I purchased more lights and tried to mask the flaw. By Christmas (about 3 weeks after purchse) two sets of lights were only half lit. The next year I didn't want to deal with it, so purchased more lights (definately NOT GE brand) and a live tree. This year I decided this $300+ tree was way too expensive to be a 3-week proposition (and at that with 1/2 of 2 sets out) and determined I would use it. Now three sets of the lights are half way out. I have spent at least 4 hours this evening alone trying to get them going. No luck. That is the last GE product I will be purchasing."
4,Good quality lights,These are good quality strings of lights. They have worked well for weeks and were delivered quickly. Can't comment yet on how long they will last. I took one star away because of the high price.
1,Does not work,I just bought an iPhone 4 last week and ordered this adapter. It does not charge or play music through my system.
3,fishy seller,"Length:: 0:28 Minsi'm giving this 3 stars because of the seller's failure to include important compatibility information in the listing prior to purchase.for the product description you would think that all ipods will work, think again.this is what the bag says""Will not charge iphone 3rd Gen, Nano 4th Gen, iPod Classic 120GB and iPod touch screen."" my iphone 4 didn't work at all, not even the sound, however my 5gen video ipod was able to work just fine.the product itself feels very solid, the cable is about 3 feet long which is enough to make it to your glove box or center console. you will need to find a suitable power source and ground if you want your ipod to get charged.i happened to install it on a pioneer DEH-P7400MP on my Ford Expedition."
4,Good Hughart Reading,"Mr. Hughart's first novel Bridge of Birds captured my fancy. I had no idea he had written two other novels until I happened upon them on line. Of course I immediately purchased them and I am glad. They were good, yet his first was the best to my mind. The products came on time and in excellent condition."
5,"Evocative imagery, good mystery, great characters","I've held on to my paperback copy of this book for 20 years. I reread it every couple of years, and am happy once again to watch the magic happen. Ancient Chinese myths come to life, along with rascals, palace intrigue, beautiful maidens (and some who you don't turn your back on!.) Very few fantasy books reach this level of creativity and surprise, plus excellent plot and pace. Find this book, read it, and you'll be pleased."
5,Another Hughart Winner,"No surprise, another entertaining and delightful Li Kao and Number Ten Ox fantasy-adventure. The grisly murder of a prominent mandarin by a mysterious ghoul provides the catalyst for this duo to go delving into China's ancient mythology searching for the answers. Along the way, author Barry Hughart creates some of the most curious and imaginative heroes and villains you will ever encounter. Just superb.Sadly, as noted by previous reviewers, this is the third and last book that the author has written in this series. On the bright side, the books he did write were all sparkling 5-star reads. ""Eight Skilled Gentlemen"" is a winner - just read it."
1,Horrible formatting - find a different version,"Good gravy, don't bother with this. It's free and worth less than what you pay. I don't know if the paper copies are readable, but the kindle edition is total garbage - the annotations are mixed willy-nilly into the text, making everything except the Introduction completely unreadable. The Table of Contents isn't hotlinked to the rest of the text, making finding any particular item a real pain in the neck.Just skip it.To all authors publishing on Kindle: If you can't do better than this, please just don't bother. This kind of junk conversion shouldn't be in the kindle store at all."
1,Oi,"Timmy Wise is a very privileged guy. First of all, he has no talent, and little education yet can make a living off of racial hatred. Second of all, he was born into a rich jewish family and taught to hate ""goyim."" His ethnic group is far richer than Scotch Irish Southerners, and just because they picked on him as a kid doesn't mean he should spend his life trying to get revenge. He needs to find peace within himself.What an embarrassment to the publisher, I smell a boycott in the air."
5,must read,"If everyone read this book, the US would be a more empathetic place to live for everyone. we might live up to the America we would like to be"
3,Not A Must Read,"I read this book as a book club selection. The book was interesting. However much of the material was redundant. As times, I felt the author was reaching to find examples to support his main idea. It was a decent book, but I would borrow it instead of buying this one."
1,Tim Wise is a total hypocrite,"According to the Assessor of Property for Davidson County TN, Tim Wise lives in a house worth $639,300. The neighborhood he lives in, in Census Tract 134, is 97% white and ZERO PERCENT BLACK.Tim Wise is a total hypocrite."
5,white like me review,When I purchased this product and contacted the seller they were very helpful. I wanted it to get shipped pretty quickly so it could arrive in time for a friend's birthday. The seller was very understanding and helped out! When i emailed them they replied on the same day. I definitely recommend buying from this seller! VERY SATISFIED!
3,worthwhile but not spectacular,"I had really hopes for this book. I thought it started off really well, then I found myself struggling to finish it. I got the feeling he hates his own white skin. A bit idealistic, but worth checking out."
1,White like me?,"The title itself, ""White like me: reflections on race from a previleged son"", is a lie. Wise is a Jew, not white. Let's hope the second edition will be called ""Jew like me: reflections on race from a previleged son"""
1,"White, But Not Like You","Tim Wise certainly is NOT. He's a self-loathing liberal apologist who blames his own race for everyone else's imagined plight by spewing this ""privilege"" myth. See Larry Elder's books instead.What's Race Got to Do with It?: Why It's Time to Stop the Stupidest Argument in America. If you have to buy this thing, use it for a bon-fire. I think this idiot is going after the chip-on-the-shoulder crowd."
4,Making Privilege Visible,"Tim Wise gets at a pervasive reality of our society that is rarely written about: the experience of privilege. This is profoundly useful. He's not a perfect writer, but the book unpacks the complexities, the social and psychological layers of privilege, in detail. There are many good texts on racism, especially from writers of color. There are lots of other areas of rank/oppression/privilege that are important to understand. But to understand what it is like to have white privilege, Wise is the guy. Thoughtful readers can extend this to deepen their understanding of privilege as it manifests in other areas of rank (gender, sexual orientation, class, etc.). Thoughtful educators can use this book to highlight the privilege side of the dynamics of race and other ranked social memberships. Privilege tends to be invisible: Wise makes it visible."
1,Anti White Racism,"Funny he thinks white men have an advantage ??? That's absurd since white men have been discriminated in all fields of government and academia for the last 40 years. A negro female with a C average could get into any medical school in the USA right now but a white man wont even get in with a 4.0. I know, it happened to me ( I was told : Were sorry but you lack diversity ). The USA is toast."
4,A good background...,If your thinking about experimenting with the sacred sage reading this book gives good basic info. A little history...A little how to...Warnings...and lots of anecdotes about others experiences
4,"As described, and doing the job so far.",As described and seems to be doing the job (all of a couple of weeks so far).A 4 for now until I see how well it holds up.
3,"Cool Pictures, that's about it","This magazine has some incredible pictures! Watching wakeboarding on TV, you really don't get the same appreciation for how high above the water these guys (and gals) are, and how contorted there bodies can get. Beyond that, this magazine doesn't impress. The articles barely scratch the surface of the topics discussed, and the bios on riders doesn't really make you feel like you've gotten to know them. If you are looking for really cool pictures of wakeboarding, this is your magazine. However, if you're looking to learn about the riders and how to perform their tricks, I'd pass."
3,Don't count on getting first issue anytime soon,"We ordered a subscription to Wakeboarding as a gift for our nephew. The order was placed in late September. As of mid-November he hadn't received an issue yet. We got in touch with the publisher and were told he'd get his first issue in February. Five months is a bit long to wait, especially since it is a gift."
4,Wakeboarding,"I purchased this magazine last year as a gift for my son for Christmas. He loves wakeboarding and has already asked to have his subscription renewed. Considering my son is not a huge reader, I take advantage of purchasing books/magazines if he makes a point of asking for them. To me this means you have put together a great magazine/product! He is also studying graphic design and talks about the front covers."
3,It's all about the sponsors!,"This magazine is good for those wakeboarders who are new to the sport. I give it 3 out of 5 stars due to the fact that it has quality pictures of wakeboarding in it other wise the score would have been quit a bit lower. However, if you have any amount of time invested in wakeboarding this is not the subscription for you! There is another magazine out there that is straight up with what is going on in your sport. Cuts the bull and feeds you the goods. So go to your local boardshop and pick one up!"
5,great product beautiful instrument,The guitar arrived flawless. Great guitar for the money.would recommend for the begginer. With a proffesional sound. Will sound as good as an expensive.one.this was a gift for one of my children and.she loves it.thank you.
4,The Beautiful Beat Around,"This guitar was a nice little addition to my fleet. After small adjustments it plays nearly as well as my other acoustics at a fraction of the price. It's the perfect guitar for keeping in the living room, near you always, and if the dog knocks it on the floor, you won't get mad. You won't be dissappointed in this pretty little gem."
5,Excellent purchase,My daughter loves her new white guitar!! It has a great sound and definitely a great price for this instrument
1,"Dated, disappointing",I was disappointed. The material in this book is incomplete and dated. Don't bother.
5,This record blew my mind and inspired my hands.,"This isn't a record for everyone. If you are one to immerse yourself into music, and appreciate expressionistic art, it may be for you.For me, this record has taken me into places I did not want to go. From making me physically uncomfortable to becoming literally paranoid and unable to sleep. It has inspired many drawings which revealed to me what I fear I am becoming the most.I do not take everything seriously, or consider life to be a depressing place, but I believe the dark and unfamiliar sounds on this record, when listened for without expectation, are very potent. It's a masterpiece, and I have longed to hear something remotely like it ever since I heard it."
2,Interesting sounds don't gel into interesting album,"2 1/2An intriguing departure for the thrash-jazzer's, this dark ambient-like work manages to convey equal parts dreariness and dreaminess when exploring it's hellish intoxication, offering the antithesis of what most head banging weirdos would be expecting. Absinthe certainly has it's moments. In carving out droning, atonal soundscapes on which to build this disc, the anti-band touches on some ravishing, shimmering muck that can be seen mostly at the beginning and end of this project. However, in a brief nine track lineup consisting primarily of controlled noise, Absinthe's unique charm soon gives way to much undercooked experimentation, leaving the entire listening experience a bit to be desired."
1,Dull,"I think that John Zorn is an important musician and like to give him the benefit of the doubt. Many of his countless albums are brilliant. Even when his music is not that interesting on first listen, I will hang in there and listen repeatedly in the hope of finding treasures not immediately apparent. However, this album just leaves me cold. I really don't care if it is like or unlike other Naked City releases, or which musicians are on it. It's one of those albums that stands on its own merits because it is so unique. It appears to be an exercise in making the smallest possible amount of sound for the length of an entire album while still making some sound. It may be ""ambient"", but if so, it is dull ambient. It's just plain dull. One can admire the idea or vision of this album but I have to say that I don't like it much, and I like a lot of Zorn."
2,Quiet and missing the mark,"While the music is well written, this release is missing the loud, frantic sound Naked City is best at performing. Vocalist Eye is missing from this release and the album becomes too sedate for Naked City fans."
2,"it's cheap, and it kind of does what you'd expect","keep in mind this costs 49 cents. it does protect my iPhone, and it does have a non-slip grip. however, it doesn't fit well. the parts immediately above and below the screen are permanently lifted about a centimeter away from the screen. also - and this amazed me - there's no hole for your headphones! you have to manually cut it out yourself. I recommend nail clippers.if you want something really cheap, go for it. but it'll probably annoy you because it doesn't fit."
5,Simply Amazing!,"Loren is an amazing woman! This book is so well-written and truly inspiring. It reminded me of my own mother and how inspiring she is to me. I hope that one day I will be a phenomenal example to my kids as my own mother and Loren have been for me. Mom, if you are reading this, you know what you are getting for Mother's Day!"
1,SUBSCRIPTION NOT RECEIVED YET,"I cannot review this item because a month later, I still have not received the first issue of my subscription. SorryFrank Calderon"
2,Required once--basically worthless now,"Years ago, WD was required reading. That was before the big ""everyone in the world should write a book"" fad. WD, likely in an attempt to cash in on that fad (and stay alive in the internet era) has switched formats. Most articles are only a few pages long, and are fluff at that. Half of the magazine is either white space or filled with oversized clip art. My advice--pick up something useful (like StoryView by Screenplay Systems, NovelPro by NovelCode or BookWriter by Yaddu Digital [no I'm not affiliated with any of these groups])."
2,Lots of fluff...very little substance.,"If you're a beginning writer, you could do worse than subscribe to WD. But a year's worth of the magazine is about all the use you'll get out of it. After that, the articles start to sound about the same, and if you become a serious writer, you'll soon want something meatier. Here's why:This magazine (and its publishers) don't seem too terribly serious about the craft of writing. What they ARE serious about is making money off of the mass of people who dream of being writers. WD and F&W; publications (excluding Writer's Market, which is actually a valuable tool) is all about giving hope (not a better chance) to everyone interested in writing a book, despite the odds being stacked against the chances of most wannabe writers actually achieving sucess. WD's only real value anymore is in the market listings it highlights each month...but you'd be better off subscribing to the online version of Writer's Market for that."
2,Are you trying to learn how to write?,"I would say the best this magazine can do is point aspiring writers toward information on writing. It has maybe two or three articles on writing and two inspirational articles, and a lot of adds for products designed for writing and publishers (which can be helpful, but don't teach writing). If you want to learn about writing take a look at some of the books sold here on Amazon there are some really great ones like (for fiction) Self Editing for Fiction writers and Writers Workshop, and writer's digest has a lot of excellent books that I believe they published and you can buy here too."
4,Recently changed some of it's format.,"I've been subscribed to Writer's Digest for almost three years. It has a good amount of advice for beginner and Pro writers alike ranging from first time author interviews, how to create characters with emotion, non-fiction and fiction advice, writing contests, and so on. Unfortunately, within the three years I've been receiving it, there has been a lot of repeat articles/advice with just different wording. As the title says, they just recently changed some of their format providing better content, and so far no repeats. One of there newest contests is viewing a photo they added and writing an opening line for a novel. The creativity is endless!"
5,Worth Reading,Writer's Digest is one of the few magazines I read cover to cover. Many of the helps are timely and the resources good. I miss my magazine when the subscription runs out. In the fast changing requirements of the publishing and writing field it is important to keep up. This magazine is worth the time and price.
2,Not that much there.,"I was actually disappointed with the magazine. When I started getting it I thought it would have lots of articles on how to write, but I found that it usually has two maybe three on fiction and one maybe two on non-fiction. Then there's a couple contests most of them are pay to enter, and there are a few writer's market clips, but besides that it seems to be a bulky bunch of adds. I still enjoy reading the parts that are in there, but there's just not that much in there for me which is disappointing."
4,Informative and worthy of purchase.,Glad I ordered it! I need a slight push and sometimes a hard shove to keep working. This mag gives it to me. It is good to see what writers are doing to keep an edge AND it is great to see what is going on in a variety of markets. Though I tried to enter a writing contest through the magazine and couldn't get access due to a incompleted internet site ... I still recommend the magazine overall.
5,A must have for those in the publishing industry.,"As an author, I find Writer's Digest as a valuable resource for improving my craft and for keeping up with the the latest in the publishing industry. It is completely worth it for those serious about a career in publishing."
3,Get the 005 Model Instead,"This model (the 006) has limited remote control (stop, start, pause ONLY) and the remote control is the only method for controling the playback. There is no volume control anywhere! There is no way to skip tracks either forward or backward on this unit. If you accidentally turn the unit off the wrong way you must start at the beginning of your audio files again. Additionally the USB is very picky. Although it would charge on the front USB ports on my less than year old Dell computer it would not allow me to download files that way. On the rear USB port I was able to both charge the unit and download files. The Philips Key Ring model 005 takes care of most of these annoyances because it has a more feature rich remote that allows you to control volume and skip around your audio files. Ironically that model costs less."
4,its ok,"There is volume control-- its on the neck strap, is orange, its not hard to miss. However nowhere in the instructions does it say this, it took me a bit to figure it out, cause it kinda in a weird spot.Its nice and metal, not easily scratched, and pretty light.There is a switch that you have to flip to either charge or playback/add new songs, with that comes 2 lights, green for charging, orange for playing, adding songs, pausing. Its an ok little Mp3 player, once you figure out where the volume is."
2,Inconvenient Design,"I love the concept of this device, however the way they implement it is sloppy. There are no controls on the USB device and you can't plug your headphones directly into it. You must use a relatively large strap as a control device that the headphones plug into. By the time you have it hooked up properly there is more bulk than with other MP3 players with controls on the device."
4,great starter MP3 player,I purchased one of these for my 14yr son. Between us we were able to get it going and download aprx 26 music titles. Love the recharable battery and the neckstrap controls. The accompaning software is much left to be desired. MusicMatch I believe it is. Will do the basics but they want to charge you for additional bells and whistles some of which should be basic. All in all a nice product for the price.
1,Retarded,"Don't be fooled by the look of this product. It's a piece of crap.1. There's only one button play/pause. 2. There's only one damn button. 3. No volume, track navigation, and you have to wear it around your neck all the time because the lousy headphones are integrated with the strap. I found it for $50 @ Target and already returned it!"
4,The Fast Forward Problem for Podcasting,"The problem is, as many of us have pointed out, there is no fast-forward button associated with the device. Thus, when you wanna find a position in the middle of a very long podcast or story, you'll need to let the player play for a very long time before you can find the position. It's been driving us crazy, hasn't it?The problem can be more or less solved by using MP3-file splitter software. Split your, say, 1-hour long file into 10 or 20 files so that you can jump to different parts of the recordings. You can basically find the software for free. I am using ""Fast File Saw & Joiner"".I got the unit from Microdirect for 20 pounds. It's cheap and memory is enough for me because I don't really mind changing music with my laptop everyday."
5,Everybody loves Jackie!,"Whether you are a die hard Jackie fan or a passive visitor of the infinite Jackie video libraries you will find this ""documentary"" highly entertaining. This isn't a typical type of documentary because it features Jackie and his stunt crew showing off how the intricacies of their action sequences. It seems Jackie actually took the time to film this twice, one where he speaks his native language and another time where it is filmed in english. He didn't simply dub it, there are two sides to the DVD.Pay attention as Jackie nails the camera while demonstrating how they use fake blood...what a pro!"
4,"Lots of details, needs organization","I thoroughly enjoyed reading Jan's epic ethernet saga.Having interfaced a Motorola 68HC12 (8/16 bitter) to aCrystal Semi CS9000 Ethernet chip I can speak from experiencethat you should buy vs build to get your web enabled productout the door. My only complaint is that this book does notcover the latest ""ethernet components"" like the Lantronix XPORTor its clones. These are embedded ethernet appliance chipsand the wave of the future for low cost embedded controllers.Nevertheless, this book forms a basic ethernet reference volumeI am happy to have on my bookshelf. If you liked Jan's previousworks on serial, parallel, or USB I/O you will enjoy this too!"
3,I would call the book INcomplete,"This book does talk a lot of things. But not in any details about the embedded design, or provide single ""complete"" embedded system design, from schematic to programming. It does have pieces from many different places, but none of them seems from one complete project. You can not use this book as a ""complete"" reference to build an embedded ethernet/Internet project.The proper name after reading through the book should be ""Basic Introductory of Ethernet and Internet to the embedded designer""."
4,Here is a book that I wish I had written,Jan does an excellent job of describing Ethernet basics and its use with small systems - embedded devices that use Ethernet for communications and control. Jan describes a range of embedded devices that might be employed for data acquisition and control applications. Also described are the other hardware components of the actual network that may be implemented.Device manufacturers typically include a simple web server that may be used for access. Jan illustrates the code that may be employed from a desktop PC and examples of code that may be downloaded to the embedded devices to enable them to operate independently. Recommended!
1,Tied to specific HW offerings,This would have been a great help but is simply not a general treatment but more a marketing vehicle for a few product offerings.
2,Buyer Beware,"Bought this fire truck hummer for a gift. When we received it all the stickers were dried and peeled off. The scale is not 1:12 it is 1:18 as noted on the box we received it in. Also, there is a sticker on the front that says ""no moking""...should it be ""no smoking""? White spare tire was cracked. Tried to work with the seller to get this resolved but after many emails and more delays, gave up and just returned it through amazon. Not at all worth the $. Not even sure if it was new...maybe reconditioned?"
3,Good Looks,I used to get magazine before. So far the first issue seems to have a lot less content than before. We will see what comes in the future.
1,Subscription started in Oct. To date Have only received one magazine,"Disappointed that the subscription was a waste of money., only one month out of 5 months received. Don't waste your time and money."
2,not the magazine it once was..,"I only bought the magazine because i got it from [...] for 5 bucks a year.It is sooo bad,same old same old every issue.I wonder if Stuff and FHM magazine lost its quality also? I won't renew either..."
4,Great magazine!!!,This was a great gift for my friend. Thank you Amazon for the opportunity to give this as a gift. Thank you!!!
3,"Digital is good, but has problems","I very much enjoy the digital copy of the magazine, but when the subscription ends, all digital copies that were selected to ""save"" to the device are no longer available. I worked with Amazon support to get them restored. They reinstated the subscription long enough for me to download and re-save the issues, but as soon as the subscription was terminated, the issues disappeared from device again. This seems like a flaw that 1) they obviously aren't ""saved"" to my device if they can be removed, and 2) that the issues I have paid for can be taken away once the subscription ends. It's the same concept as the publisher asking me to return the physical copies once my subscription expires."
1,maxium,you sent it to the wrong address. It was suppose to go to my son but it came to me instead. I am 57 year old woman and i dont enjoy this magazine. I dont know how to get it corrected.
1,Garbage!,"I got this for my (then) boyfriend and it's just smut! He told me it was humorous and I got him a subscription for his birthday. Girls, DON'T DO THIS! I swear he liked the magazine more than he ever liked me. When a new issue would come he would not do anything with me until he finished it and once I saw the covers I refused to go anywhere with him if he was bringing it along ""to show Ted"" (his idiot friend)."
1,where is my magazine,I just received the first issue of a full years subscription and never received another one again. This is a rip off
4,ITS ALL ABOUT THE PICTURES,This magazine really is about the pictures...the articles have no real significance...but is that the point?
1,"Ugh, Worst Subscription Ever","Last year I was offered a couple of free magazine subscriptions when some of my frequent flyer miles were about to expire. I had a dim recollection of thumbing through a few issues of Maxim at newsstands and feeling a bit of danger as I snuck a peek at some partially clad women within. Well the minute I started receiving this silly periodical I was put in my place BIG-TIME! On the cover of one of the first issues I received was that no-talent, teenybopper sister of Hillary Duff who is trying to glom on to her more-talented sibling's sucess to advance her own ""career"".... what's her name?... Hailey! Ewwww, I know Hillary Duff's sisters name, purge me, exorcise me! Anyway, with the exception of a few truly stunning and somewhat nude women sprinkled occasionally throughout the various issues, there is nothing much to look at or read here. Don't waste your money on this ad-stuffed trash. In my case, it now makes a direct trip to my recycling bin."
1,Going downhill,I wouldn't pay for a subscription to this mag. It probably won't be around for another year. In the last year it has changed for the worse. The women are gradually getting uglier and the reading is on a third grade level. It's a bad deal when the women in the beer advertisements are way hotter than the women featured in the mag! If it takes you more than ten minutes to look through this mag then it's because you dozed off.
4,"Fast and cheap, interesting magazine for men","Similar content to Playboy, but for a younger audience. No nudity, but hot pictures of women, often famous. Magazine itself is interesting and a good buy for 16-25 year olds.Great service through Amazon for magazine orders. Magazine was delivered 4 weeks from order date. Interestingly, they sent the current and next month's magazines at the same time. Ordered Sept 6, delivered Sept and Oct issues on Oct 2. Price is great for what you get."
2,Maxim has really fallen down,"When it first came out, I had a subscription to Maxim Magazine for about 4 years. I enjoyed the college type humor. I could never figure out why they show partially naked babes, but NEVER any of the good stuff. They even seemed to photoshop out any sign of a nipple. Always. So I dropped my subscription. Recently I tried Maxim again. They had offered me a really low rate for it. Well, I wasted my money. They have only gotten worse. Maxim has become a very low quality, farce. I would never buy it again."
2,"Less pages, more @#%&*ing cardboard ads!!! not happy","i have been a maxim subscriber since the 90's, and i can say that i am very disappointed with what has happened to this magazine over the last year or so.I now get a smaller magazine, by 25-30 pages, and there are these obnoxious ads that are cardboard that the magazine always opens to! there is of course the option of ripping these out, but of course you destroy each issue. there used to be only about 2-3 a month, but now its regularly 4 in each issue."
1,Nothing but fluff,"This magazine is nothing more than Cosmo for men. How to make your sex life better, how to bag the hottest chick, blah blah blah. Face it, if you're looking for a magazine to make your sex life better, it won't work. If you're looking for soft porn, you can download more off the Internet than you'd ever dream about getting in hard print. And outside of soft porn, this magazine has absolutely nothing to it."
1,Maxim has Fallen so Far!,I have been a subscriber for 10 years. I will not renew. The magazine has changed completely. It is all filler and puff pieces. No interesting articles. Stick to Playboy for those. I think their staff truly believes in their own hype.
4,pros and cons,"I've been a subscriber for several years now. I was trying to decide between maxim and stuff. I chose maxim because the info is very random and entertaining (i.e. how to do doughnuts in your car, ect.) They do have some photos of actors and such, but many were of people from other countries and just other pretty girls you may have never heard of... I would suggest this magazine."
2,Equal time??,I certainly do hope one of these days that Maxim magazing will get women who are small-breasted equal time.That's all I have to say.
3,so wheres my magazines?,isnt there supposed to be a magazine every month because ive only recieved two or three in the 9 months that ive had the subscription.
1,Where is it?,Ordered April 19th. It is now June 16th and still have no magazine. 8 plus weeks later. And it says my subscription will run out May 2012. Why should my subscription start before i even receive my first issue? No customer service what so ever. Will never buy another magazine subscription through amazon again because the publishers can not be trusted. DON NOT BUY FROM DENNIS PUBLISHING!
2,Still haven't received it...,"While I love Amazon and its services, I have yet to receive my FIRST issue of Maxim (which I also love). I ordered it at the same time as my subscription of Men's Health and I got my first issue of that about 3 weeks ago. Now I'm deployed so it's likely that someone probably saw the Maxim mag and took it. The delivery date is set for June 29th so we'll see what happens. If this is not the fault of a mail thief and is the fault of the shipper, then why does it take so long to get this magazine? A two month delivery estimate? Really? Come on...."
1,havent recieved it yet,"Ordered this is May for my son, but he hasnt recieved any of the magazines yetslow shipping time"
1,Useless Junk,"Useless, sensationalist articles reminiscent of some Women's magazines. I went through a recent copy from cover to cover and found little of interest or practicial use.Part MAD, part Tiger Beat, with a dash of WWF digest to boot."
4,Good Entertainment Value,"Maxim represents one of the simpler pleasures in my otherwise complicated life. Its ability to condense popular culture into 200 some odd pages of gloss month after month, exploring music, film and video, new gadgets and clothes fashions, as well as their interviews with topical personalities continually amazes me. Even the advertisements present me the opportunity to see what name brands are moving in the ebb and flow of the marketing world. Compared to a movie or a new CD or book, this magazine holds its own in terms of entertainment value. With a subscription, this magazine costs less than a dollar an issue! I would be hard pressed to find a similar value ANYWHERE in the entertainment world. And this one has pretty girls to look at to boot.Thanks.Roland"
4,"Good magazine, but not as good as it used to be","I've had a subscription to Maxim for several years now, and I must say the the photo shoots are going downhill both in the quality of the pictorals and the women chosen for them. There's too many skinny model-types in it for me, and I prefer women with curves (the recent Jessica Simpson issue was a welcome change of pace, though). The articles still maintain their informative and/or witty nature, so if you only get it for the articles (yeah, right), you're making a great choice."
4,"Some good articles, some not...","MAGAZINE REVIEW:This is my favorite magazine.Recently, I started to notice that the useful and interesting articles--the ones that actually offer you advice--were outnumbered by the jokes, interviews with celebs, and pictures of scantily clad women. I don't like the magazine as much as I used to, but it's still my favorite magazine. The ""How To"" and sex tip articles are the best; the sports facts that the magazine occasionally features are also good. In my opinion, the magazine is certainly better than ""Stuff"" (from the same makers of ""Maxim"")."
2,Immature Magazine,"I subscribed to this magazine for over a year. At first it is was cool and fun, but then after a while I got tired with it. I realized that the articles and features are just stupid and useless. The women are hot and the pics are nice but that's the only good thing about it. I think this mag is pointless. I recommend Playboy, a more mature men's magazine."
3,"Pure fluff, but not in a bad way...","Maxim is fluff. I had to get that out of the way first. There is really no purpose other than to entertain... men primarily.Now then, it is not a bad magazine overall. The photos are pretty cheesy overall, but no more so than the Swimsuit issue of Sports Illustrated. The articles are for the most part well written, if not exactly pulitzer prize material. They tend to do a short interview with the cover-girl of the month, and have a few intersting articles if you dig.Overall, there are much worse ways to spend time than reading Maxim, and it is the perfect size & content for bus/train/airplane rides. If you travel a lot, this might be the perfect magazine for you."
1,Get this ... mag off the shelves please!,"Maxim started out as a great British mix of babes and guy reading style mag, with nice covers, interesting women featured, with nice photography and humorous articles. Since it split into two versions (US & UK), the US one went completely downhill. Less of a mag (but bigger than the UK because of so many ads) the photography of this magazine has to be just about the worst of any of the men's magazines on the shelf. Just look closely at any cover on the shelf. The women do not look human, they look like animation. WAY TOO MUCH AIRBRUSHING IN PHOTOSHOP guys. I love looking at women, but real photos please, not digital nightmares. An awful looking mag."
2,Bland,"I totally agree with Matthieu. Maxim has become a bland, uninspiring, conforming magazine with issues that read like each other. I recently picked up a copy at newstand and after 5 minutes I threw it away."
2,I just dont like it anymore,"this magazine has slowly evolved into a woman's magazine.In the formative years, it featured sexy women covered with provocative writing.Now the every pic, article and comment seems to be written by women for women.A case in Point is the December 2012 pinup feature of the cover sirens; None of them are worthy,and the writer thinks it is interesting to know where they buy their clothes and what kind of Christmas music they like. WTF"
3,Advertising?????,"When this mag first came out I thought it would be another mindless T&A mag. I was surprised to find that it actually had some readable and informative articles. Even this lass found the male oriented humor funny. But, now it has sadly become ""Playboy lite."" The pictures are too glossy, they have fewer articles, and 60% of it is advertising. When they go back to a more moderate middle groud I will try it again."
5,One of the best,"This magazine is one of my favorites (and im a girl!!) I love reading the articles, and think this magazine is definatly the ultimate guys magazine. When i saw the covers,before reading the magazine, i just thought it was another trashy magazine filled with naked women. Although it is filled with half naked women, it is very entertaining to read"
1,The Most Useless Magazine Ever,"Well there is eye candy on the cover but that's about all there is to it. It's Cosmo for twenty-something metrosexuals. Can I give it a -5 stars? I got a free 1 year subscription on a lark 2 years ago and it's still coming. I moved without telling them and they tracked me down. It's like a bad cold, it just won't go away! :("
4,Enough to Satisfy...,"I personally have a current 4-year subscription to Maxim Magazine. The magazine has a unique but interesting way of incorporating all of the topics a man could possibly want into one single piece of reading material. Women, sports, the latest tech-gadget reviews, automotives, and much more are all covered. The best part, as I read in an earlier review, is that the magazine is put together in an easy-to-understand format. The humorous pictures are great to look at if you're in need of a good laugh. The girls featured in the magazine are cute, although not extremely hot always. This is fine for me, as the skimpy clothing they wear leaves a lot to the imagination. I prefer it that way. So for me, I based my rating on the magazine as a whole and not individual issues. Some issues in my opinion only score 1 or 2 stars out of 5, while other issues easily get the highest rating. So I went with a 4 out of 5, with the majority of the issues being worth the money. I recommend it."
4,Great magazine.. has seen better days,I love this magazine. have subscribed since it started and I always loved it's sexy women (cuz i'm one ;) hilarious and satyr filled articles and it's no-nonsense attitude.I agree with another reviewer that there is a definite diffrence as of late but until it gets real horrible i'll keep on reading.
1,Stupid Maxim,"I cancelled the subscription prior to ever receiving the item. Even still the first two magazines came and I'm sure the rest will continue to come. Either that or they'll stop and not refund my money. I continued to email the publisher, yet no response and no credit has been issued to my card. This publisher is horrific and I would never purchase from Dennis Publishing again."
1,Only got 3 issues!!!!,I ordered a 1 year subscription but only got the first 3 issues!! and now they stopped coming.
1,I can feel myself getting dumber while reading this magazine,"If you are subscribing to this magazine solely to look at beautiful women, then subscribe. Otherwise, I would not recommend Maxim, go for GQ or Esquire instead. The magazine contains a lot of gossip, and low brow articles. I can feel myself getting dumber while reading this magazine.Pros- CheapCons- Dumbed down- Lacks depth, superficial"
1,a 50's Magazine,"When I was offered this mag for practically nothing, I figured I'd give it a shot- pretty girls and all...BUT, there's nothing that I can say that's positive about this magazine; it's awful, like a 50's men's mag."
3,"No problem with the magazine, thought I was getting Sp. vers.","I looked through the magazine and it's not bad. But, I'm studying Spanish in school and thought I was getting the Spanish version so yeah I am dissapointed with the purchase. The magazine is geared towards men but I did find a few points of interest I liked and I am not a man. So for that I rate it 3 stars. I figure I didn't pay that much so I can live with it."
3,It is what we thought it was.,"The magazine was gotten noticeably thinner compared to past years. Still funny, occasionally interesting articles to go along with fantastic pics of hotties famous and not. I paid $10, which seems about right. Anymore, and I would drop the subscription."
2,Not my style,This seems to be tailored more for bachelors who are only after a booty call. Too many crass articles and language ffor my married man tastes.
3,Mediocre Kindle Version,"The magazine as always is great, a 5 star product, but the kindle mobile (tablet and phone) version is beyond subpar. I had to get the google play subscription because their digital version is true to the print version. The kindle version leaves a lot to be desired. The only reason this gets 3 stars is because of the print version, the kindle digital version alone gets 0-1 stars. I hope this is taken as constructive and the format of the kindle digital version can be changed to replicate the print version."
2,Purchased for a friend,"I cannot review this magazine personally as I purchased this subscription for a friend who's inside, so I am sure if he was reviewing this magazine it would get top marks. I am sure he will enjoy the half naked woman.................."
4,Maxim 2 year subscription,"Maxim is my favorite magazine but they have gotten a lot smaller over the past couple months. I noticed this change because I keep all of the issues and they have been getting smaller and smaller. But there are still pictures of super sexy women, funny articles, and tech stuff."
2,Would be nice if I got an issue regularly,"The subscription started out without any issues, the magazine in around 4 or so weeks. The first half of the subscription went without a hitch, and I received the issues on time. However, since then, I have received maybe 1 issue in the past 3 months.The magazine is what it is, bubble gum for a (guy's) brain. But I have to actually have the magazine to enjoy it."
2,Maxim,"This was a gift and the person I sent it to has not recieved 1 issue yet, so I cannot make a review and neither can the person who was supposed to recieve the gift. It is going over 2 months. So I do not thnk that I should give a good review. Thanks"
1,Would help if I actually received the product I ordered!,I placed an order for playboy and maxim back in may for my husband. Playboy came but 5 months later we're still waiting for the first Maxim issue. So definatly NOT SATISFIED. Have contacted publisher and still no magazine or refund :(
1,Don't waste your money,Horrible magazine filled with nothing but ads! I knew this wasn't going to be a highly intellectual magazine but when my husband even said he didn't like it I knew it was trash.
5,Always a good read,"Maxim is a very well written magazine and doesn't have a ridiculously overwhelming amount of ads. It is funny, to the point and you will even learn a couple of things."
2,"Unless you're 17 and under, don't bother","Yes, there are pics of beautiful women. Most of them have been airbrushed, but still...they're beautiful. With a rare occasional interesting article/tidbit, Maxim is the same boring, repetitive nonsense every single month. 2 or 3 months in and you'll see it for yourself."
4,good stuff,The magazine is always delivered on time and my only complaint is that the address label is printed on the magazine instead of being a removable sticker. Sometimes this blocks the cover art and that is annoying.
1,"Cover to cover advertising, virtually zero content","Once upon a time this was a good magazine worth reading cover to cover. Unfortunately they've slowly been replacing content with more and more advertising. As the magazine currently stands you could probably finish reading the actual ""content"" in about an hour. The rest is advertising and BS. This magazine jumped the shark a long long time ago. Just let it die already like it's supposed to."
1,Maxim has gone downhill big time,"I've been a loyal subscriber since 1998 and have always enjoyed the magazine. Something happened to them in early 2006 - they've either been bought or have hired a new editor / staff or something. This magazine is absolutely terrible now. All ads, fewer and fewer pictures of babes in each issue, and the hilarious articles are now long gone. My last two issues (Sept and Oct) were in the trash within minutes of pulling them from my mailbox. I'm canceling my subscription."
4,Maxim,Not the greatest. The chicks are super hot that's the only reason I have this magazine. Get a subscription it you wanna check out hot chicks.
2,maxium,I do not like the new maxium book. They are using paper that seems recycled and looks cheap. It seems like maxium is trying to cut cost with the cheaper paper and I definetly will not renew my subscription unless they change their book and go back to the old version!
