1,Feather in the wind,"I couldnt read the whole book I read about one third, it seemed so stupid and weird. I love historical romance but this was just too far out there."
3,Couldn't get into it,"I have read several Native American romances and have really enjoyed them, but I just thought this was ok. I never felt a real conection with the characters. Another reviewer mentioned a lack of ""fire"" between the main characters and I completly agree. The ending also agrevated me as well. Their love didn't seem as strong to me as it should have been. It might have had something to do with the heroine being a romance writer. I think that constant reminder actually did not allow me to forget that I was reading a romance and become immersed in the world. I found myself skipping pages to get to the end so I would at least know how it ended. If you like Native American romances you should check outNavajo Night. I enjoyed the love story more."
4,Excellent Book,"I love anything written by Madeline Baker and this book is no exception. It was Romantic, exciting and just plain sexy. I loved the hero and heroine they were so in love even time couldn't keep them apart."
5,Feather in the Wind by Madeline Baker,One more notch in Madeline's 'Great Novel Post'. This was a Super read.I highly recommend this bookFeather in the Wind (Leisure Historical Romance)for all Historical Romance lovers.
5,This is the best book written on the subject,"No other book offers tips from people who are the best in the securities business. I would recommend this book for anyone involved in sales, those running their own business, and even individual investors looking for a new advisor or interested in investing for themselves. I'm looking forward to the next Winner's Circle book."
5,Beautifully Relaxing Music,"This CD is so relaxing, and the music is just beautiful. My favorite song is ""Waterfall Rainbows"". I highly recommend this CD, as well as his others."
5,Holiday by the sea,"This is a amazing CD, it brings so much to one that it feel that oyu have been on holiday."
2,"Great Idea, Horribly Boring Translation","The complete works of Arthur Rimbaud is a truly a treasure to have and a necessity to the library of any lover of the poetic form. Unfortunately, in this collection Wyatt Mason renders Rimbaud sterile of all the visceral poetic beauty his works possess and reduces it to a modernized, lifeless and hum drum banality that does it a great disservice. Do yourself a favor and get Louise Varese's beautifully magisterial versions of A Season In Hell and Illuminations and if you want more go with Wallace Fowlie's translations for all the odds and ends and a more faithfully literal translation."
4,Unsatisfactory translations,"First and foremost, this book is a godsend. I've been trying to piece through the Pliade edition of the Complete Poems for two years with little sucess, so having an English translation of Jugurtha & all of the other poems in prose and verse from 1866-1870 and through the rest of Rimbaud's life is nothing short of a miracle. That being said, the Fowlie translation is still the superior model for all other pieces, Louise Varese's rendering of the Illuminations being the only possible exception. Regardless of the rather lukewarm reviews that have been written of it in the past, Fowlie still shows the clearest attention to meaning and meter of all of Rimbaud's translators. While his ""keeping in the spirit of Rimbaud"" could certainly be called into question, at least in terms of his person, it is doubtful whether he will ever be surpassed."
3,"Well organized, but to say 'complete' is a ostentatious","A refreshing new look at the work - I give it a high mark for effort - but the author took great pains to avoid Rimbaud's love relationship with Verlaine, and he completely disregarded the translation work of Louise Varese, which is one of the most eloquent translations that exists.The book at times gets too scientific - which appears to again be the authors attempt to avoid the fact that Arthur was an extremely eccentric, gay or bisexual creature - which to me is half the story.Where are his letters to Paul Verlaine? ""Complete"", I think not. But this work does fit well in a greater Rimbaud collection. It never ceases to amaze me how posthumous critics and scholars work feverishly to harness that which cannot be harnessed: the free mind."
4,Satisfied,"This did not fit my steering wheel very well. We had to force the cover on. Not all steering wheel covers were made to fit every vehicle. I have an SUV and it was very difficult to fit. I liked the feel of the cover. I think the design should be fixed so that the character is not upside down at any point. When placed on a steering wheel properly, the characters should both be in an upward position so that the characters are at 9:00 and 3:00 on the steering wheel. The 3:00 position will always be upside down on my steering wheel no matter which way you put it on!"
4,betty boop steering wheel cover,"Fits well, looks fun. My only complain is that it doesn't keep the steering wheel any cooler in the hot sun."
3,just okay,Nothing great. Just a bunch of regular garbage with ol Bill Dance yanking in bass.Has a couple tips that you already know.
4,"Good Stuff, Can't Complain",I'll make it clean cut here; the buyer gave me what I wanted and the item is in great shape. What else could I ask for? Very happy and the delivery was of average speed.
4,"Initially, I hated this book.","History can be boring, and dry. The book starts with, as one may expect, the dawn of photography. At first, I avoided this book, letting my reading for class pile up until midterms hit and SURPRISE! I found myself needing to read half of a textbook. It was that task that lead me to love this book. I sat and read it, which at first, was painful. Then as it drew on, I realized, that I was enjoying learning the roots of my passion, and that Hirsch wrote it in such a way that drew me in, and was actually entertaining. I got a 102% on that midterm, and I went on to buy a used copy of this book when I stumbled across it."
4,"Highly informative,almost too much information","This book was broken up into two classes at the Art Institute, although it could have been used for four classes. There is an overload of information in this book, all accurate, mostly unbiased and very thorough. The reading does get monotonous, it's written with the same academic tone and vocabulary as any book on any subject you would find at an Ivy League university. I would have preferred a lower level vocabulary. I'm perfectly capable of understanding academic writings I just don't want to when I have a test of the dozens of slightly different developing processes of the early 1800's in two hours. The writers proved that photographic history is just as valid as any other history, great job."
5,Very quick!,This product was exactly how it was described and I received it VERY quickly which I completely appreciate.
2,Book not in new condition!!,"Amazon needs to contribute a partial refund on this book. It is not pristine new condition. The covers are dog eared and bent up. Being used as a reference book, I am sorely disappointed I was sent a lightly damaged copy when I had paid for a brand new, pristine copy. Damage to a paper cover is simply not acceptable when one purchases new.Needing to read it, I did not have the time allowance to send it back to be replaced."
5,Hidden Talent,"I have heard Sherrie's songs on the radio and seen her videos on TV in the past. But it wasn't until I saw her sing her last single ""Streets of Heaven"" on a GAC special that made me take notice. That along with all the positive reviews on Amazon.com, I decided to purchase her CD.There are several good songs on this CD, ""Ride'em Cowgirl"", ""Fools Like Us"", ""Remind Me"", and ""I'm Still Fallin"".The best song is her title cut ""Streets of Heaven"" which should go to number one.I was real impress with this CD and plan on buying some of her previous CDs.Sherrie has alot of talent, her songs need more air time. She could be Country's next rising star."
5,I'm amazed,"This wax is incredible, I feel bad calling it wax. It's so much more. Like previous posts, it's very important that your car is super clean before applying because anything on the paint stays on the paint from here on out. I'm a big clay bar advocate. In fact, I'll wash, dry, polish, claybar + polish, and then apply rejex. Trust me, if you're willing to go thru that all day process the results won't disappoint. I also chose Rejex for it's supreme performance but I can also attest to it's long lasting affect. Even after a year the car was still beading (to an extent) but not as amazingly as when you first put it on. The first time it rained after application, my car was the only dry on on the hwy. Water didn't stand a chance!"
2,Doesn't help with brake dust,"Like most Audi owners, I struggle with an unbelievable amount of brake dust buildup on the wheels and paint. After reading all the positive reviews, I was hopeful that Rejex would help prevent the brake dust from building up so quickly. Sadly, I noticed no improvement over a quality wax. Rejex is easy to use and is at least as good as conventional wax at keeping bug jerky and other contaminants from sticking to the front of the car. Unfortunately, brake dust remains a problem. The best defense I've found to brake dust on the wheels is Armor All wheel protectant. The Armor All product works much better than wax or Rejex, but it is expensive and only effective for a short time."
5,Unbelievable accuracy!,"I don't think there is a reader out there that can hold a candle to this program. The easiest to work with for ANYONE. You can scan all the pages and then proccess them or scan, read and spell check each as you go along. Then you simply tell it to put it in Word or your clipboard and it will put one or all the pages into one easy to use, or print format. Minimal mistakes, usually caused by poor scanning settings or dirty copy. I tried the try and buy program first and couldn't imagin being without it!"
3,Like it but not made well,I purchased this lamp for my bedroom and it was a little smaller than I expected but I still liked it. But 3 days after I purchased it I accidentally knocked it over and the plactic socket broke and that surprised me because it wasn't a fall from a table just over on the same table it was on. The shade didn't even dent but for some reason the socket broke into 3 pieces. It wasn't really worth paying to send it back because the lamp was not expensive. But if you are looking for the review of how it looked it was a cute little table lamp.
5,"Just like 5:00 pm, I thought it would never get here...","Been waiting a long time for this one. If you like rock, blues, and all the good stuff in between, you will never regret buying this album. It's Gonna Be a Hard Night is worth the price of admission. But then there are all the other great ones: Let Me Love You, Sail on Sailor, Workin' for the Children... and I could go on. This is one of the finest albums ever made, imo. You'll kick yourself if you don't get it."
3,Stabbed In The Back,"How do you have a 2-disc ""anthology"" of the O'Jays and NOT have somewhere amongst the 30 tracks ""Back Stabbers""??"
2,too difficult for children,"I bought this tape for my child as i expected it to focus more on health and nutrition. Nutrition is so important for our kids today that I thought it would have represented a big part of the tape. Unfortunately it barely touched upon the subject.Apart from that, it was very difficult to grasp for kids; even for adults it isn't easy.It is informative and expalins the workings of the body in great detail. As far as I am concerned, too detailed and complicated for young viewers.Lets have one that really explains the effect of nutrition on our physical and mental health please."
4,Private Buckaroo,"Private Buckaroo is a wonderful wartime movie which I would reccomend to anyone who likes movies of the 1940's, and/or The Andrews Sisters. I am also a Three Stooges fan, so I also liked seeing Shemp in it too."
3,It's all in the dancing,"If young dancer Donald O'Connor catches your eye in this film, it's thanks to choreographer John Mattison, who taught O'Connor (among others) much of what he knows. Mattison's daughter, Ethelyn, also dances in the chorus. Mattison, who danced in Vaudeville and on Broadway before working in Hollywood, went on to become a well-known dance teacher. His students included Basil Rathbone and Dan Dailey."
2,Private Buckaroo with the Andrews Sisters,"I purchased this video because it contains performances by the Andrews Sisters. The movie itself is waaaay beyond lame, having been filmed during World War II. But I did enjoy watching the Andrews Sisters, and that's all I really wanted anyway. If that's not your reason for buying this video, prepare yourself for a really dopey film."
1,Of some historic interest,"This is essentially an armed forces recruitment film made by Universal shortly after the U.S. formal entry into World War II, utilizing some comics and swing musicians to raise the patriotic tenor. The wispy plot relates how the entire band of Harry James decides to enlist in the Army to follow its drafted leader, with a subsequent U.S.O. follies being organized directly before the entire group marches avidly into combat. With the exception of the reliable Mary Wickes, the comedians, in particular Joe E. Lewis and Shemp Howard, are dreadful and serve only to make the various musical interludes, notably those featuring the sprightly Andrews Sisters, a welcome relief --- from comedy. Former big band singer Dick Foran, who warbles the title tune, is the featured non-musical performer tasked to deal with the hapless propagandistic script, but 16 year old Donald O'Connor nearly steals the show along with some of his jitterbugging cronies."
4,Private Buckaroo,I received the item in a timely manner and it was exactly what I had hoped it would be. I would continue to make purchases from this vendor.
4,GOOD FOR THE PRICE,"I mainly wanted this DVD for the Andrews Sisters songs. Quality of film was not great, but for the price, I'm pleased."
4,Perseverance Rediscovered,"Arthur Pink's work on Eternal Security is like a double-edged sword swung against the unbiblical errors of both the Wesleyan notion that one can lose his salvation and the modern ""carnal Christian"" doctrine that supposes one can have salvation without sanctification. Pink's essays (originally published under the title ""The Saints Perseverance"" in Pink's magazine ""Studies in the Scriptures"") deals with the doctrinal foundations of the saints security, provides helpful safeguards against extremes and abuses relating to assurance, and gives practical direction on how to ""persevere"". It is a thoroughly Calvinistic treatment of the subject. While the chapters are uneven in their literary quality, the content is worth reading. This book is a helpful antidote to the sickly condition of modern Christian teaching on eternal security."
2,A great How-to book,"Anyone who wants to start designing their own bead crochet designs should have this book. Written by one of the experts in the field, the book explains how to graft a design successfully. Beginners will find helpful information on bead crochet supplies, a few patterns, but most importantly, the tools to take bead crochet to a higher level."
3,"Expensive pamphlet, but nice designs","My husband and I laughed when the large, standard-sized Amazon box came and the only thing in it was this 20-page booklet. There are a LOT of designs in it, but like one of the other reviewers, for $22 I would have expected more of a gallery. I'm glad to have it, and even more glad that I was able to use a gft certificate for it. However, it's still a great second step beyond basic bead crochet. (Do not start with this book if you are new to bead crochet!)"
2,not worth the money,This is a small 20 page pamphlet with information you can find online for free.Very overpriced for what you get. If it was $8 it would be worth the money
2,Too little for the price,I was a little disappointed with this book. Maybe I was expecting too much. For the price I was expecting much more of a gallery and much more bead crochet information.
4,A crowd pleaser,"Though my taste in Amine tends to go away from what is aired on tv b/c they are often very bubblegummy, Inuyasha is a great exception, though its not really a must see for hard core violence junkies but there's enough action in it to keep everyone entwined. With the ongoing plot line,undlining mini advenctures and character developments, Inuyasha never seems to pray to much on the predictable story lines. It truelly is a crowd pleaser. I dare anyone to watch the first set of episodes and not be jonesing for the next."
4,Fabulous story for all ages,"It's a wonderful story and the vocal crew did a very good job of bringing it to life. You really get sucked in, like with a good book. It's only two hours long so it's perfect for a short road trip. I remember loving it when I was a kid and I still love it! Definately appropriate for all ages!"
1,Not impressed,"I tried listening to this tape on a recent car trip and was extremely disappointed in the quality and the ""arrangement"". It was hard to hear what was being said due to the other voices and such talking in the background. I didn't even listen to tape 2."
3,Five Stars If Only...,"The movie was as good if not better than the other adaptation of the Veronica Guerrin story. This film introduced fictional character names, and several events varied between the two. However, it did stay true to the overall theme of her story, citing many of the more significant occurences during the time the main character decided to expose the drug trade.The main issue I had was with the product itself. It was a promotional disc, not meant for distribution. During the viewing session, I was subjected to the following message (I'm paraphrasing): ""Property of ....For promotional Purposes Only, Not For Sale or Distribution"". The message came up more than a couple of times, in bold white lettering, on the bottom third of the screen.I guess you get what you pay for. However, I would have opted for a newer copy had I known about this."

3,DO YOU LOVE ME RUBY?,"ASHEEEE-BA-BA-BEE! It still gives me the WHILLIES!I am speaking of my title caption spoken from thePaul McCartney eyed Janit Baldwin. You see I saw thison a WED. in 1977(I do not know how I knew it was aWed. But I do.) it was a double bill of The Hillshave Eyes and Ruby. Piper(where is the Oscar for Carrie)Laurie plays Ruby a former gun moll who is haunted byher slain lover who possesses their autistic teen daughter(Baldwin)while murdering former gangsters now working at thedrive-in. Curtis Harrington drenches everything in his usualsoft-focus photography. Some best scenes for me were thesoda machine hooked up to a person,so when you put in yourdime? You got a cup that filled with blood! And of coursethe possession of Baldwin where her voice is lower than JamesEarl Jones of Darth Vader fame...Do you love me Ruby?Ashheee Ba-Ba-Bee! Still CREEPS me out! Though nothing likeDeodato's THE CAUST (1980) But than nothing is likecannibal holo CAUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Good B Pic.,"A new product, but it had digital dropouts and the extras and the end of the movie would not play. I think it's the shelf life of digital. Thanks!"
3,Ruby,"This was a spooky movie for the time. I love a good ghost story. I really enjoy Piper Laurie, (Carrie, Twin Peaks). Stuart Whitman is a favorite and I also like Brad Davis from the orginal Dark Shadows series. I would rate this movie a B-. It did copy some silly stuff from the Exorcist. I would have loved to have seen more of the gangster days (back story) along with the good looking ghost from the past."
2,Kinda Silly,"This movie was watchable, and succesful at the box office but not scary in the least. Piper was great in this film. In the special features I heard the director of this film speak of The Blair Witch Project, stating ""it must be good markenting because he sees nothing scary about the arrangment of some sticks.""Well I would say to him, the thing that was scary to some people about the Blair Witch was what you don't see, not the sticks it is not the gore and blood because there isn't much of that in Blair Witch. I would go on to say that I see nothing scary about a woman shaking on a bed especially after a movie called the Exorcist already did that. I would also say I see nothing scary about a cheap looking skeleton in the water grabbing a woman. 2 Stars for effort"
5,The best,I think the Norton Sistem Works is the best deal for the price. It works and fix problems in the computer to make it work flawless and fast.
1,Installation Problems,Does not install on XP. Attempts to contact company by e-mail and phone fruitless. Web site for serious techno-geeks only and following the company's instructions when found do not solve the problems. Non-software from what appears to be a non-company.
1,Fine.....If it's your 1st time!,"I've tried for a month; 'discussion groups', personal contact, etc. and Symantec WILL NOT tell you where the imbedded files are that prevent you from installing a newer version! Double talk? Plenty! The answer? Forget it! Personally I think the attorney general should be investigating fraud! Msconfig, registry, uninstall, add/delete programs, search. Try them all! Maybe Bill Gates has the answer, but Norton WILL NOT devulge the secret! ..."
1,ripoff rebate,"The rebate only applies if you have proof of purchase of a previously owned virus protection (and it must have been a boxed or downloaded rather than subscription protection).Yes, I like the product but think the rebate is very misleading."
1,Stinks,"I have owned this product for over 6 months. I have tried to update the virus scan 10's of times. After downloading 4645 MBeach time, this nitwit software comes up with an error code of 1821 which equates to ""tried to write update to a file that was in use"". I even SHUT DOWN every file on my computer, except, AOL and Explorer which is minimum to run. It still comes back after downloading that enormous amount of MB (4645mb) with the same nitwit message, file in use can't download the update.Who ever heard of such poor software, it is unbelieveable."
3,Norton Systemworks 2002,"Found after using this product although not this version.That my Internet has not been protected . Here I ran the normal,testing . Told me that I was protected.Very direct wording. Giving ways to correct the problem. With theSept.11th tragedy . First thought is being protected in anyway.Anyway meaning in a very honest to be way.What I can Not understand with all warnings from Norton. Warningof No protection was never brought to my attention.Rating at 3 is probably too high."
1,Conflicts with Windows XP System Tools,"I installed Norton Systemworks 2002 in my new Sony PCV RX650 the First of February. After having installation problems, I experienced a system slow down but everything else appeared to work fine. I soon discovered I was unable to defrag without conflicting with Windows XP system tools. After running Norton's defrag tool, I actually had a higher percentage defragmentation than I had before I ran the defragmenter. I then attempted to run the Windows XP defrag tool and got error messages followed by a system slow down. I uninstalled Norton Systemworks and used the Windows XP system tools with no problems. I intend to purchase Ontrack Suite 4 and will not consider Norton in future purchases."
1,Stay away,"Where to begin? This thing has destroyed my e-mail, loused up other programs and I can't get it to uninstall!! My system has had performance problems that I've traced directly to this program. I've talked to experts in the IT field and most say these Norton programs are all show and no go. Buyer beware!"
1,RETURNED PRODUCT THANKS TO REVIEWERS COMMENTS,After buying the product from OfficeMax I decided to check what it sells for on Amazon.com - am I glad I did!!!! After reading these reviews I decided to take the advice of many of your reviewers and avoid SYMANTEC altogether. Any company that has this many problems with their product and then CHARGES for tech support in my opinion is a company to avoid. Shame on you SYMANTEC - if you don't get your act together soon and listen to your consumers you'll be the next company we'll be reading about that gets bought out!
1,Now obsolete! Don't waste your money!,"I just tried to renew my Norton Systemworks 2002, and the Symantec website said that the virus definitions, program updates, and so forth, for the 2002 version are now discontinued, and that I need to upgrade to another version."
2,Additions to SystemWorks 2.0 (upgrade) from 1.0,"The SystemWorks package works well for Os 9.x or lower but it caused many problems for me once I changed my operating system to OS X. After reading many forums from disgruntled users of Systemwork's performance, I knew it was not just me complaining. The 2.0 version includes Alsoft's Disk Warrior 2.1, which I also own. Its sole purpose is to rebuild damaged directories. Why did Symantec's 2.0 version include a product from another software competitor? That is not a difficult question to answer..."
2,"Too Bad, not quite ready for WindowsXP","This was a great program before Microsoft introduced WindowsXP. Works great in Windows 98. In WindowsXP you will find some of the Norton's Utility functions provided under Windows 98 missing when running WindowsXP. In fact, I think even $39.95 is too much for what amounts to little more than a virus checker.All you get besides the virus checker under WindowXP is a (1) duplicate disk defrag program that functions at a slower rate than the one that ships with WindowsXP, (2) a disk doctor {which cannot fix any problems, they are be fixed by rebooting and the CHKDSK program} that functions exactly the same as the error-check utility provided by Microsoft, and (3) a program that checks the registry for missing keys, etc.If you have WindowsXP do not waste your money on SystemWorks, just buy a virus checker. If you are still using Windows 98 this is a great program."
1,Warnings about uninstall problems 100% accurate! DON'T BUY,"I just spent two hours trying to install SystemWorks with no success. I had an old version that I wanted to upgrade, but could not uninstall the old version first so it wouldn't let me install the 2002 version. And, my effort follows that of a Microsoft Certified Software Engineer friend of mine who also couldn't figure it out. Pretty scary when someone who's profession is computers can't install their product.On top of all that, Symantec CHARGES you if you want to actually talk to their tech support!!!! Textbook poor customer service. It's not like I've had the product for a year - I opened the box yesterday.Do not buy this product - and, frankly, after realizing they charge to support their own product, I'd recommend avoiding all Symantec products all together."
3,Not os good as 2000,"I love Norton System Works for the way it allows me to keep my computer running like a dream. The program integrates Anti-Virus software with utilities for maintaining your system, fixing problems and cleaning your drives.System Works 2002 offers some new features, but cuts back on some of the usability of 2000. I ended up not even installing the Clean Sweep utilities, choosing to keep these programs from 2000. It took some jiggering to get the program to accept my changes, but it was worth it to keep some utilities I use regularly, such as the Duplicate File Finder. If you haven't used previous versions of Norton, you won't miss these utilities, and will be grateful for the ones you get, such as Disk Doctor and Speed Disk, which far outstrip anything that ships with Windows.I'm running Windows 98 (still!), so I didn't have the problems XP users have had installing this program. Hopefully all that will be sorted out for 2003."
3,Sometimes New Isn't Always Good,"This version still has alot of bugs in it. The Anti virus works Great! Its the other applications that seem to work when they want to. When running Norton WinDoc...there is always an error that never seem to ""fix"" themselves."
1,And You Call This Being Safe????,Use Norton Systemworks in WinXP and watch both the antiviral and utility portion stop working. You may think your protected but your really not. What's happening here to cause such a serious flaw? I have no idea. All I can say is that I have encountered this probem on both my computers - a brand new HP XT1000 laptop and a Dell desktop. Both Systemworks and the stand alone Norton Antiviral have stopped working. After uninstalling and reloading the problem was encountered a week later. I intend to contact both HP and Norton. My advice?Save your money until they provide a fix
3,Not the Best,"John talks way too fast to even have a chance to relax.However, you can still try to enjoy visualizing the meditation, if you don't mind doing it fast!Although I was disappointed by this, it will not deter me from buying his other tapes, because I do appreciate his knowledge and guidance, even if it is fast paced."
2,bad sound quality,"I love all of John Edward's books and DVDs that I have bought, I own most of them. I gave this 2 stars because the CD was poorly recorded. It sounded like you were listening to an old worn out cassette tape. Also the meditations on this CD are the same ones that are on the Evolve with John Edward DVD set, so if you own the DVD set don't buy this CD unless you want to do the meditations without having to use a TV and DVD player."
4,Lovey visualizations.,"I'd give this product five stars but for two reasons. Reason one: John speaks so fast and doesn't allow for longer time lapses during the meditation to pause peacefully and reflect. I found my own solution. Taping the CD to a blank Cassette and adding the pauses I need to ""relax"" and really meditate. However, I love John's imagery and explanations.Problem two: Since I know how to meditate, John has too much breathing going on in these meditations. Take three or four deep breathes, as he describes and that's enough. No need to breath as John recommends. With these annoyances, the visualizations were still worth the money for the CD's."
4,Raising Your Awareness,"I will never be considered a occult type person, but I've always felt that we are not alone in this world. These tapes provide a reasonable procedure and help with anyone who would like to raise their awareness of things around them. It might not be for everyone, but for those who do want to try I find that it gave me a method to try."
2,The Hidden Words,I thought this was The Hidden Words set to music. It is not. It is the verses being read with music in the background! I am disappointed with it.
3,Second nature - a second chance,"It is a short novel, and yet it is a good one. Proof of that the length of a book does not determent it's quality.The book is sweet and in a lot of ways the charters get a second chance the will give them the opportunity to find out what really matters, and maybe to see something you havein a different light.Though I wish Roberts would have developed the main characters more and explore them more, it felt like they had much more to give.But it is a good and relaxing read!"
3,"Good, but not great early Nora Roberts novel","Lenore ""Lee"" Radcliffe is a magazine reporter who seeks an in-depth interview with publicity-shy horror author Hunter Brown. Okay, here's the unrealistic part: he'll only grant the interview if she comes camping with him for two weeks in a canyon in Arizona. Now, most magazines would never let their employees spend that kind of time on just one article, but apparently Lee's employer really wants this story, so she has to do it. Over the two weeks, they learn all about each other and fall in love. This book introduces the character of Lee's best female friend, photographer Bryan Mitchell, who gets a book of her own, the much superior sequel, ""One Summer."" Lee and Hunter briefly appear in that book as well...."
3,Eye Rolling Expectations,"If you are looking for a not completely stereotypical character set up for a romance novel foiled with cheesy lines and an over-dominate male lead this is the book for you. If your eye muscles need a yoga like stretch, the first romantic interlude between the lead character will more than suffice with wide eye-rolling moves. If you like recalling when blue eyeshadow seemed like a great idea, buy now. If you want a simple romance novel that you know is ridiculous but you can at least finish in under three hours than this or really most romance novels will do. I don't mind not being surprised but I also enjoy watching the same romantic movies over and over again too."
4,Second Nature,Was an easy read and the pace was good. I always enjoy Nora Roberts. One of my favorite authors. Am always looking for her books.
2,bad movie great set,"I think this is a terrible movie. It creeped me out they way they all sneak around spying on each other. The only reason I watch it is because the movie was made at the Ashland Belle Helene plantation house. This house is on the Mississippi River about half way between New Orleans and Baton Rough. I was lucky enough to have a tour a long time ago with the caretaker. He took us all over the house including up on the roof. Now the house and property are owned by Shell Oil and not currently open to the public. I stop by everytime I am in the area just to gaze at it from the fence. It's in a beautiful setting with huge old oak trees. When watching the movie, I totally ignore the acting and look past them at the views of inside and outside the house. Who Dat!!"
3,Bayou Brothel,"THE BEGUILED is a Clint Eastwood film you seldom hear about, and it really isn't worth seeing. It involves Eastwood playing an injured Union soldier who is wounded in the south and taken up by an all-girls boaring school. Instead of turning him over to the Confedrates, they decide to nurse him to health, andf the result is all the women literally fightin over him.Directed by the late, great Don Siegel, THE BEGUILED is a type of movie I have never seen before. It involves Eastwood being the victim and the antagonist at the same time. Having mutiple affairs in the boarding school eventually leads to intense conflicts which results in the women plotting to kill him. The sad ending coupled with the bizarre plot are the reasons why this is not of Eastwood's better films. He does give a good performance as John McBurney, and the agony he suffers after his leg is amputated will really shake Eastwood fans."
1,Ghastly,"Once you start this movie, you can't stop--not because it's so good, but because it's so bad that you have to know what ludicrous thing will happen next. I don't know many people who have seen this movie, but those who have react to its title by recoiling in horror and shrieking. No exaggeration. The story is ridiculous, the characters are all overwrought and poorly portrayed, and the finale is laughable."
1,"So Bad, It Leaves People Incoherent","This movie was so bad I couldn't stop watching--I had to know what implausible, ridiculous thing would happen next. The acting is completely over the top, and nothing--nothing--is believeable. I know a number of people who have seen this, and, like me, every one of them howls in horror when the title is mentioned."
5,somber...,"Have all Clint on dvd, and this i must say, had to be the most eeriest, somber movie i ever saw.When you watch it, you say to yourself..""that's Clint?'still a classic, but strange.Cannot wait for the movie after this one, PLAY MISTY FOR ME.these two are great ones!"
5,A Neglected Gem,"It is regrettable that this movie has been marginalised. The production design at Belle Helene in southeastern Louisiana is superb, the story evocative along psychoanalytic registers, and the performances commanding. Geraldine Page, Mae Mercer, and in fact most of the actors are very strong. Clint Eastwood's libidinous character is in for some surprises when he is carried through the symbolic locked gates of this girls' school in the Civil War Deep South--wounded but predatory, provoker of the most intense ambivalences. Civil War themes, Southern Gothicism, 1960s discourses on race and sexual liberation, and a persistent brooding myth-and-symbol approach evocative of classical Greek tragedy provide a heady and disturbing brew. It is astonishing how obscure this fine film is. If you like this review, you will swoon over the film itself. Bravo, Amazon."
5,southern peaches?,"This is a little known film that was done when Eastwood was drop dead gorgeous and extremely young. the plot is disturbing but It's quite a movie. Like Fatal Attraction meets Play Misty for Me, meets Gone With the Wind. I had the VHS and wanted the DVD for my collection."
3,Almost Porn!,"This movie is crazy. But of course The Clint is starring in this movie, and he is looking great, actually better with beard than shaven. This movie is so crazy that I think they should have gone the whole length and turned it in to some kind of porn movie. The Clint as porn star!"
5,Great Period Piece,"Very authentic timeframe depicting the tattered, oppressed Civil War South. Not terribly fast-paced, but life back then was this way. A must for your Clint collection. This 1971 installment from his long career exemplifies his broad acting range. Buy it if you like Clint and his style, and the story is not bad either!"
4,Fascinating and usualy film,"A complete bomb at the time of its release because audiences went expecting a typical Clint Eastwood actioner and instead got this eeire drama about the sexual mind games between a wounded Union Soldier and the ""inmates"" of an all-girls Southern school. Nearly thirty years later, we can appreciate the film's artistic qualities, the almost surreal direction, and the uniformly wonderful acting. And we can certainly admire Eastwood and legendary director Don Siegel for striking out in a new direction with high quality material."
4,"""suprisingly good""","I actually don't own this dvd, but I happened to catch it on cable. Nothing else was on at the time, so I said what the hell. But as I started watching it, I couldn't stop. The movie is that good. In it Clint Eastwood plays a wounded civil war yankee soldier who is cared for by women/girls at an all girls school in the south. At first they thought about turning him over to the authorities, but Clint's character begins to charm them, and soon after he begins sleeping with a few of them. Jealousy takes over and they begin to turn on him. I won't tell the ending, but this movie definitely sneaks under the radar!"
4,wow,ok it not to bad guy kills vampire and vamp kill him and years later some people three sexy girls mmmmm yummy sexy and two guys who want to be vampires try to bring them from dead but couldnt girl finds a book at sale then her friends go and bring back vampire and he claims one girl as wife and the other girl her body was take over by the ghost of man who killed vampire and he back to finish job. now is nude mmmmm sexy girl naked n making out and the girl who body taken over has sexy accent. yea you not going see sex but boobs and kissing .
2,Not up-to-date,I purchased this book for a classroom lesson but the information is out of date and the pictures are dated as well. I was disappointed to say the least.
5,Hollywood at its Best!,This movie is number one on my list of movie favorites. The color and the costumes are reason enough to see it - but dig a little deeper and ask yourself what director Douglas Sirk wanted to say about race. This movie is truly a revolutionary object of its time.
4,Delivery and condition,I am very with this product the delivery was quick and it arrived in good condition
5,Excellent Condition,A Heartfelt movie and was in new condition just like the seller stated. The seller also used fast shipping - only took 4 bus days to recve.
1,Didn't even get the movie,I wanted this movie for my mother it's a great film itself I recommend you see and you will love it but the place I received it from is either stupid or don't care about their customers because when I finally did get the shipment I got don't tell mom the babysitter is dead! What the heck there's no comparing the two movies I was and am very disappointed and am looking for other outlets for my films from now on
5,IMITATION OF LIFE,"A great movie about two single mothers, one white and one black raising their daughters. The black daughter gives her mother much heartache while trying to pass for white. Mother dies heartbroken. Daughter comes to funeral in much grief, crying and grabbing the casket saying how much she loved her. This scene is so emotional you will never forget it! I orginally saw this film in 1959-60 at the show. I've also seen it many times on tv several years ago. Have a box of tissues handy."
5,My First Movie....,This was my first movie I saw when we were allow to visit the movies. As a kid was so excited about the going to the movie for the first time. Now that I have Grand Kids just wanted to share some of the movies from my day. I feel our children should know what life was like when we were going up. If you don't share what you was taught with your grands then all of that life learning experience is loss.
4,"A ""must have"" for any movie collector!!","Althought there are few extras in this, the story is still as wonderful as I remember it. BRILLIANT performances throughout and the story is beautiful and gut-wrenching all at the same time. Love, friendship, racism, motherhood, sacrifice, chasing dreams are just a few of the topics that this film addresses. Do yourself a favor...add this film to your collection."
5,best movie i have ever seen,this is by far the best movie i have ever seen - i saw it over thirty years ago and i still remember it vividly - the acting - the story -everything about it
4,The sudsiest suds,"The Bottom Line:Imitation of Life is undeniably soap opera, but it's also *really good* soap opera that develops characters we care about even as we recognize how artificial they are: if you want a film that's unabashed in its manipulation of the audience yet extraordinarily successful in doing so, watch this stellar film from schlock-meister Douglas Sirk.3.5/4"
5,My favorite movie of all time,"This is actually my favorite movie of all time. A timeless Hollywood classic, with gut-wrenching performances turned in by the entire cast, the movie explores racism, friendship, and complex-mother daughter relationships. For some time now, my mother and I get together once a year or so for a viewing of our favorite movie. The first time my husband witnessed it, he was reading in another room, and heard wailing coming from the living room. He rushed in to see the two of us bawling-- despite the numerous times we've watched it!"
5,movie that will stand the test of time,"this movie reminds me of the fact that we should never hold a grudge with a family member, because it maybe too late"
5,A True love story,This movie is a true love story. A mother's love for there children. A love that that's deaper than the color of your skin. Lana Turner and Juanita Moore play's great parts in this classic story.
4,Excellent!,"""Imitation of Life"" has to be one of the most interesting yet painful movies I have ever watched. On one hand you cheer on Lana Turner as she struggles and finally succeeds at being an actress, then on the other you feel horribly for her maid as she struggles with her daughter denying her identity and her mother by passing for white.""Imitation of Life"" is an excellent film that gives those of us not yet born in a time of racial segregation and struggle and glimpse into what that was like. I'm sure all of us are thankful that we were born in a time when things like this aren't as prevalent.I would highly recommend this film to anyone. It's not only entertaining, but also draws you in to the lives, struggles, and triumphs of each of the characters."
2,"Wonderful film, lousy DVD","I watched this film last night and see that other reviewers have already posted warnings about the appalling quality of the DVD transfer. I add my comments to theirs only in the hope that somebody somewhere in a position to do something about it may one day produce as good a transfer as this film deserves. Looking, for the first hour at least, as if it was filmed through a hiking sock, the DVD destroys all Sirk's brilliance with colour and design so that what you end up with is a dull, flatly lit TV soap. Rent it, certainly. Buy it only if you're a genuine Sirk fan."
1,Film's great - DVD transfer not worth purchasing....,"Thanks, David Durbin. Your review made me pull this order from my shoppiong cart. ""Imitation"" is a real ""tear-jerkin'"" classic in the old mold. I ran it as a Theater Projectionist in it's original 1959 theatrical release. The last reel was about a 12 minute run. I could step out of the Projection Booth after the chnage-over, and regular as clockwork it would happen. I would hear the start of a swell of sniffles, and tears come up like a rising tide in theater in that last reel every night. That was when audiences showed emotion openly. I won't buy any bad DVD transfers. I strongly bad-mouth bad transfers to all my film buff friends to also not buy. With the quality of DVD's, why buy garbage. Most of my DVD purchases have been with Criterion for that reason. Sure hope Criterion get their hands on ""Imitation"", and a lot more classics!"
5,Why does the DVD cover art ignore the black cast?,"I'm a white man, but I find it appalling that the studio rereleases a movie about the intertwined lives of four women - two black, two white - in a story that's charged with racial issues but IGNORES the black cast members on the DVD cover. What is going on? Both of the black actresses were better than John Gavin, on the left, and who cares who the bland actor is who played the theatrical director? He hardly registers in the film but somehow trumps Juanita Moore and Susan Kohner here. Nevertheless, the film is incredible, especially considering its era, and is far more powerful emotionally than Todd Haynes's brilliant and beautiful 2002 homage to IOL director Douglas Sirk, ""Far From Heaven."""
1,"GREAT flick, LOUSY DVD!","""Imitation of Life"" is one of my favorite movies--I consider it Douglas Sirk's greatest masterpiece. BUT I'm extremely bitter and disappointed with Universal's shoddy DVD release of the film. There are virtually no ""extras"" (a trailer is included and that's it), and the print used is not in the best of shape. If any film deserved the ""red-carpet treatment"" for its DVD debut, it's this one. This DVD is no better than the VHS version, really. I realize that not every movie released on DVD is going to get the ""deluxe treatment,"" but it seems that classics like ""Imitation of Life"" deserve better. My advice to potential buyers is save your money and hope that a better DVD of ""Imitation of Life"" will come along later."
4,A True Classic,What a great film my grandmothers loves this movie she would stop and watch it whenever it came on tv which is not often.So i decided to buy her the movie.She loved the quality of the picture and sound because in the past she had a old worn out VHS tape that didn't work well So she was thrilled with this DVD. Although it didnt have any extra features or commentary she still loved it.It's one of the few pictures that can make her cry i'm not sure why you would watch something that makes you cry but shes happy with it so i'm satisfied with this DVD.
1,this movie is a classic!!!,"But I had to give it a 1 star to be able to comment. It kept pausing during the movie...every 10 minutes or so, the movie would pause as if it was loading up and we had to literally wait until it was done and it did this threw out the entire movie. Wasn't happy about that."
5,VHS,I misread this & thought it was a DVD. This is one of my favorite movies. I should have read more closely. Fast shipping.
4,Imitation of Life,I saw this movie with a friend a few years ago. I bought it as a gift for them when they couldn't find it in the store.
5,WONDERFUL TEARJERKER,This is one of my favorite older movies. I remember watching it as a teenager. It has a wonderful storyline and also start Sandra Dee and Susan Kohn. They don't make movies like this one anymore!
5,Bow Wow's cd is real tight!!,"I love Bow Wow, he is my biggest fan, and I love his cd; it's real good. All of the songs on the cd is tight! but my favorite ones are get up and crazy, but most of all I like the perfect girl interlude, most of evrybody likes that one. If anybody out there don't have this tight cd you should get it and I promise you won't be disapointed.Love,Dana aka Cutie. Bow Wow's #1 Fan."
1,More like Barf Bag,"Here's the ringmaster of Infant Hip-Pop. (Lil' Romeo and Aaron Carter being his ridiculous little understudies). This music is absurd, lifeless and insulting. It's not even worth anymore of a review. I'm done. NEXT!"
1,All bark and no Bite,"I got this CD for Christmas and played the first couple of songs(if you even want to call them songs), and could'nt manage to torture myself any longer. The next day, I took it back to the store for a refund, but the store would'nt even take this garbage back. I managed to sell it to this little girl who probably also listens to britney spears and lil romeo for 5 bucks. This album demonstrates perfectly how actual talent means nothing these days if you can get ten year old girls to like you. On the reviews above this they talk about how his rhymes are more mature. What? He doesn't even write them! They like him because he doesn't cuss. My grandmumma don't cuss either, and I don't see her on no reviews. How he goin' be the best when he ain't nothin' but a voice with a pretty face. Posers like these are what's messin' up the music industry. Little rich kids like him who get easy rides are makin' it hard for any real MCs to make it."
2,This is OK,"Lil Bow Wow or Bow Wow as which he calls himself now puts out his 2nd LP called ""Doggy Bag"". This really would satisfy the taste of 13 and 14 year old girls and boys. Jermaine Dupri does do well in producing some hits like ""Take You Home"" and "" Thank You"". But theres nothing really else out on this LP that will keep it shining after those two tracks. This CD was rushed and had too many interludes that meant nothing, especially "" Jimmy The Cricket"". Most of the other songs he flaunts about money and girls 5-8 years older than he is. Bow Wow really needs to rap about things that 14 year old boys can relate to. Not money, cars, and over your age women. Average kids don't understand that and they don't have it either. Bow Wow is a okay MC but Lil Romeo and him will probably be in front of a camera than behind a mic."
5,IM the hottest,Lil bow wow u just dont know the way u move so fast across the floor i mean u run though my mind like all the tyme 2 the point that i want to U TAKE HOMEHES DA HOTTEST U CANT LIE
4,Lil'Bow Wow U Just Know...,this is his best album yet! there's so many songs you can dance too! it's the wickedest!
1,Finally an honest album title!,"This album should be used as a bag to pick up your dog's s----. Yeah it's that bad! People this isn't rap, this is pop garbage for little kids. Don't support this idiot. I don't know what Snoop was thinking when he put this idiot on. Support good rappers such as Eminem, 50 Cent, G-Unit, Cam'ron, Lil Wayne, Juvenile, B.G The Diplomats, Beanie Sigel, Boyz N Da Hood, Cassidy, Snoop Dogg ect. That's good rap right there not this pop garbage."
1,Doggy [poop]!!,"This CD doesn't deserve to be on this planet.First of all, the kid's like 13 years old so his voice hasn't even broken yet.Second of all, I still haven't found out what genre of music this is. I'm glad there is not many rappers out like this that are too short to go on a rollercoaster!!Don't buy this, please, don't support Lil Bow Wow. Instead, buy some good rap like Ja Rule, Nas or DMX."
1,Terrible,"This is what we feed our children? This corperate (junk)? I saw ""lil' bow wow"" on the Today show the other day. HE CAN BARELY SPEAK ENGLISH! Its very upseting that this (...)is recorded. Its even more upsetting how many (...)people will actually buy this."
1,"why'd you do it, snoop?","this kid is the worst ""rapper"" ever and doesn't even deserve to make music. go listen to something real, mobb deep, nas, CNN, mack 10, kurupt, Redman, Old Skool Ice Tee, Cube, Public Enemy, MC Ren, Rakim..."
1,Why?,"Why does lil bow wow even try rap,he doesn't write his stuff,and what makes him even more sad is his closest companion is jermaine dupri a joke in himself,i wish lil bow wow,lil romeo and any other fake rappers would just dissapear or stop acting like little thugs,which they aren't.Peace"
1,Stupid,"This whole cd was outrageously bad. If you like wannabe rap this is the album for you. If not, get a different cd."
4,for a fan its FANtastic,"to be completely honest if you are not already a fan and just go buy the cd i do not think it will be as enjoyable as to a previous lbw fan.I have been a bow wow fan for awhile and love the boy,i bought it because i like him not for his music.I think ""thankyou"" in my opinion is the best track.He did a great part of writting the lyrics and for a 14 year old he did a awesome job.Its a difrent kind of tune then his old cd by far.It has alot of rhythm to the songs.Its also very clear he wanted to get his point of views on many things in his lyrics.I do recommend buying it but if its your last 15$ dont spend it on this cd"
1,doggy bag,...so corny if your a teenager listening to this album something is seriously wrong with you the name bow wow in itself is lame can u really take an artist with that name seriously? all songs on both albums are weak and[way]below average but icant knock em to much because i am an adult the final thought is the only reason why bow wows albums sell is strictly because of his sex appeal not because he has skills thats one to grow on !
4,"A Good Read, Well Documented.","I read this book in a week, which is fast for me. I was fascinated in this story of Chinese Americans in the deep south in contrast to my own experiences living in Seattle. There are a lot of similarities but certainly different. This book is scholarly with many sources cited."
4,So you know.,"This is a book for young adults with reading deficiencies. Often, young adults with reading difficulties are not interested in the topics of books at reading levels at which they are proficient, especially if that level is three to four years below their true age. Books such as this are meant to get such children to read, even if the topic is somewhat unconventional. This book is not meant for adults, unless they are looking for the most cursory overview of these weapons."
3,Painting Murals:,Comprehensive coverage of painting murals in a variety of settings and surfaces. Used book was in excellent condition. Worth buying.
3,Okay for indoor work if you need ideas,My position - I'm looking for how-tos on exterior mural painting. This isn't it. It does have good advice for a novice thinking of brightening a room or nursery with art. There is a need for that - but the glowing review already posted made me hope it would serve my needs. I'm just providing a counterpoint.
4,Darn good book,"I liked this book! The selection of feats and prestige classes was decent, and the ranger finally doesn't seem like a useless class thanks to this book. However, there are DEFINITE errors in each section of the book where ECL is dealt with--however, anyone with a brain can figure out how to properly add up ECL."
3,Fine book?,"I was looking forward to see this book. I was exspectingsomething more like Barbarian Shaman, and not eiher many priestige class for Barbarian."
2,lacking,"this book was lacking quite a bit i thought...it had one part devoted to describing the three classes a little more in depth than what was found in the players hand book...another part devoted to new feats, of which i thought they were for the most part not too exciting, although i did like the brachiation and the infusion feats....i wasn't too big of a fan of the prestige feats either..i think the best guide books was the one on the wizards and sorcerers, but you know, got to a game store or bookstore and leaf through it for yourself, you might find things you like about it that i didn't"
2,For DMs not players,"The bread and butter of any guidebook is to (a) flesh out classes in rich detail (b)have new/cool feats (c)have really new/cool prestige classes. Unfortunately, this book fails on two fronts. Any player, except for the very new, would consider the information plebian. My biggest disappointment is in the prestige classes, which are geared for NPC's or, at best, solo adventures. For example, Deep Woods Sniper, Geomancer, Bloodhound, Foe Hunter, Verdant Lord, Forsaker, Windrider, Watch Detective, are all too specialized, requiring a severe limitation of campaigns. And don't get me started on the Oozemaster (what were they thinking?). I did like a couple of the prestige classes (Tempest, Animal Lord). Finally, the feats are solid, but favoring barbarian classes, which is good because barbarians were ignored for prestige classes."
2,Utterly disapointing....,"First off, this is a fairly thin title, like most of the books of this line. It does clear up the druid rules, but does nothing for the ranger. It does little for the barbarian as well, though that class needs little help. I cannot say I like many of the prestiege classes either. All in all, this, sadly, is pretty much a waste of time. wotc, shame on you."
4,Better even than Tome & Blood,"This is truly the grand finale to this hit-and-miss series. Some great advice is provided on when your barbarian should rage, what favored enemy will give your ranger the most mileage, and on what animal companions to pick up. Don't bother playing a druid without this book. The book provides a snotload of handy feats, though some of these are repeats. Legendary animals are detailed. (These are like dire animals, but better. Check out the Legendary Tiger!) The spells are on a par with those from Tome & Blood. The prestige classes are better than those found in Sword & Fist. The rules update on the Druid's wild shape ability is as good as the trap rules in the relatively disappointing Song & Silence. This is the best paperback product out of WOtC since the advent of 3e, including Hero Builder's Guidebook!"
4,"Barbarians, druids, and rangers.","3 classes noticably underplayed in the d&d world are represented here.The barbarian comes out the poorest in this book, because much of it focuses on the druid. But all in all, it's a good book for me, because I play druids and bards best.The new classes are interesting variations on the way the game works. Queen of the woods, beastmaster . . . it's most interesting to say the least.If you play druids and rangers, buy the book. You might want to buy the book if you're playing a barbarian and are stumped for ideas."
1,Didn't work.,"The battery fit, just like the Sony, but the camera sends up a flag saying, ""Use infoLithium battery"". Therefore, I still have to get the Sony."
4,Wow! Powerful poetry!,"Performance poetry? Glenis plays her poetry like an exquisite instrument, producing literary music that has a power that makes the printed page seem small."
1,Horrible,"Screen cracked in the first month, battery dies quickly and once I have cleared out my messages the phone continues to page me as if I still had a voice message. You are better off with two tin cans with a string tied between them."
1,JUNK phone worse company,"I've been using STI Mobile for over 4 years now. Things are alright if you don't mind a weaker signal than competitors, rarely use your cell phone AND don't have a problem. If you have a problem of ANY kind YOU will pay for it with ridiculous amounts of YOUR time YOUR money and YOUR frustration. Even though its STI Mobiles fault. Unless you almost never use your phone, a low minute plan from any other company is well worth the couple extra dollars!!! One unhappy customer shows a company has poor standards. Do a little review research and you will see overwhelming unsatisfied customers."
3,For younger kids,"This toy is for younger kids with a big imaganation. In my opinion, this toy is for kids under the age of 10. I'm 12, and I can't find anything to do with it. But my seven year old brother can."
2,Don't waste your time or money,"I was hesitate to buy this kit because of the other reviews of the film/tape coming off, but I wanted to give it a try. It was simple to install; however, after just two days, the film started coming off just like other reviewers had said. I watched the company video and cleaned and dried the window just as suggested (I thought maybe others had not been so thorough), so it can't be dirt or oil causing the problem. I believe the tape is where the problem lies. I will look for a similar product from another company because I could tell an immediate difference in the temperature which was great."
1,"Not REMOTELY easy to install, garbage product","After thoroughly prepping the surface the tape doesn't stick. Except to the backing, which it's nearly impossible to remove from. By the time you've gotten the backing off the tape, the tape has come off the surface you want to adhere it to. After using the ENTIRE roll of tape on one small window, the plastic sheeting barely stuck to the tape. Where it did adhere, the tape pulled off the wall.Junk product. Do not purchase."
1,Buy something else!,"First time attempting anything like this, so I had no idea what to expect. It took a couple windows to get the hang of it, but even then this kit didn't work well at all. First, peeling the back side of the tape was nearly impossible and took way too long. Second, as others have noted, the tape doesn't stick well at all. It stuck better to me than it did the wall. When we finally were able to get one set, it fell down within a day or two. All that work for nothing and it left us just as cold as when we started. Definitely try maker of this product!"
1,If it ain't broke don't fix it,"I felt like I needed to write a review to help out some folks interested in buying this product. My husband and I have been using this insulation kit for a few years now, and it has always worked fine for us in the past. This year, for whatever reason, Frost King totally changed the tape that comes with the kit and it sucks unbelievably bad. I cannot believe this tape even made it onto the market, that's how bad it is. Didn't anyone even test it first?Anyway, if you read the reviews on this site, you'll notice all the good ones are from 2009 and earlier, before they changed the tape. We ended up using the plastic sheeting that came with it anyway because we were lucky enough to find some leftover tape from last year. However, we will never buy this product ever again. Next year we'll pay the extra $ for the 3M kit!"
1,"Don't bother, buy from 3M instead, the MAKERS of adhesives.","Frost king should just buy their adhesives from 3M, the tape that comes with this kit is useless. I followed every direction to the ""T"", and the film WILL NOT stick to the tape. Absolutely will not stick. I'm returning the product today. Don't waste your time with Frost King."
4,window stuff works,This window plastic was very easy to put up and it has made quite a diference in our home. Now that the plastic it up we can see exactly how drafty some of our windows are and it is really amazing we didn't do this sooner. it was shipped to me in quick time and was inexpensive. thank you.
1,"Horrible, did not even last one day.","This is the first year I've had to pay for my own heat in my apartment, so I decided to buy this kit to help ""weatherize."" My boyfriend and I spent about 3 hours carefully taping and attaching the plastic to all of our windows, following the directions on the box. We were very proud of our work and could already tell the cold air was no longer getting inside. Unfortunately, the next morning I woke to see that the plastic had come off of half of the windows, and a couple of days later it had fallen from every window in the apartment!The Window Insulation Kit turned out to be a total waste of time and money!!!"
1,Worst product I've ever used,"I have never used a worse product in my entire life. I stopped halfway through, threw in the garbage and got 3M products. To start with, the double sided tape is complete crap. It doesn't stick, but that's not the worst part. Trying to peel off the backing after it has been applied to the window seal is a joke. The fricking strips are cut every two inches, so you are basically peeling off a thousand little pieces of tape. At this point, I yanked off the tape I already put up and will never use frost king garbage ever again. DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,Wrong Size Makes This A Useless Product,"The actual size of the plastic films put in the box were different than what was advertised on the box cover! They were supposed to be 62"" long, but were only 60"" in the kit I had purchased from Home Depot. I also read some other reviews with similar complaints before writing this review myself! I have already returned this item and will probably try 3M instead."
1,Tape is garbage,"My husband and I live in a very old house, and we thought we would try this window kit to prevent cold air from coming in from around the windows. We have been struggling with it from the beginning. The tape sticks to the window sill and walls just fine, however the plastic will NOT stick to the tape at all. I've been standing on a chair, trying to get the plastic to stay for about 10 minutes before finally giving up. The tape is worthless and isn't sticky enough. This product is absolute garbage, and I will not be buying it again. I'm extremely disappointed."
1,"Cheap Garbage, Don't Waste Your Money","I inherited a box of this junk from my house's previous owner, having previously used just the 3M product. I was first struck by how thin and chintzy the plastic felt. Then I put the tape on (a clean surface I might add) and it instantly came up. Fair enough, maybe the product was old, so I got a fresh package and the same thing happened. This is a lousy product that, unfortunately, they somehow conned all the major hardware stores (inc. Lowes, Home Depot, Sears) into carrying instead of 3M. That's why I'm on line to order the good stuff!"
2,disappointed,the plastic melted when i blew a blow dryer over to shrink it...the tape was difficult to adhere. The length was tight to fit over my window. all in all very disappointed with the product.
1,Cheap piece of crap!!!,"This product is a waste of time and money. First of all the tape doesn't stick to anything, not metal, not drywall, nothing. And if you manage to get the thing up, water and cold air still get through. I would have given this piece of crap a zero if it were possible."
5,A little warmer this year,Every year I say I'm going to cover the windows and every year I don't. This year however I looked on Amazon and found the right product for the right price. I even got the nine pack which worked out well because I turned one sheet sideways and used it to cover two smaller kitchen windows.I followed the directions and cleaned the surface once with cleaner and when I was ready to apply the tape I cleaned again with Alcohol. The first one was a little crooked (but still worked) but by the time I got to #4 it was smooth sailing.I can feel them move slightly in the breeze so I know that they are keeping the cold out. I would definitely recommend this product.ps I'm a not so young lady and I did it all by myself.
1,Do NOT Buy This BUY 3M!,"This product doesn't have strong enough adhesive tape, the film easily comes off of the tape as well as the tape easily comes off of your window frame. Buy the 3M, its an excellent and superior product. I have used both Frost King and 3M and will never buy another Frost King product again. We noticed a difference in our bedroom after covering our poorly insulated windows with the 3M kit, worth every Penny.Frost King KitPRO: NoneCons: Tape doesn't have enough adhesive. Film is thinner, cheaper. Easily comes loose!!!"
2,Stick with 3M insteadI,"I applied the Frost King wrap meticulously and carefully and within days the tape came loose (even though I'd applied it with much pressure)! I ended up having to redo all the windows using thick double-sided mounting tape from the dollar store. In all, this doubled my cost of the shrink film! I used the 3M product in another abode and though it cost more, its performance was superior! I'll be writing to Frost to complain, then hereafter using only 3M."
2,"the sheets are not 42"" by 62""","so it may not seem like a big deal to the company that the sheets are only 59"" long instead of 62"" but it is a big deal when you are trying to cover 58"" windows. grrrr. what a waste of my time that I have to return this product and reassemble my blinds."
4,The best on the market but...,"I've used this product many times and it definitely does the job of keeping the cold out and the heat in. My heating bills show a major difference and that's my main goal. This brand is better than other brands because the plastic is sturdy. Here are my complaints: First of all, when you blow dry it tight, the tape doesn't stay glued. Also, it never blow dries smooth enough, even when I know I got it up straight. So I don't bother blow drying at all anymore. I can see through it just fine and I've gotten used to seeing the wrinkles. Oh yeah, the biggest pain in the butt is getting the backing off the tape. Not good! But I'm ok with it overall because I'm toasty warm. :)"
2,Hard to follow,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This book is not focused and not targeted to an audience. Most of the features are not covered with enough depth and background to make the information useful. The chapter on replication, which is an advanced feature, was pretty good, but the chapters on backup and recovery where poorly explained."
2,Vital Information Missing,Bad even for a dummies book. Vital information is missing and makes serious assumptions about the knowledge of the reader. I can't recommend this.
3,SQL Server 2005 for Dummies,A good basic intro to SQL Server 2005. Not in depth enough to help with advanced tasks. But a good starter.
2,Very Disappointed,"Actually I just start to read this book. So far I can say it very disappoints me. The author use the first two entire chapters to 'list' the features in MS SQL Server 2005. For me, a newbie, totally have no idea what he is talking about."
1,NOT an Introduction Guide,This is in no way an introduction guide for anyone with no knowledge of SQL Servers. Usually these type books are a good starting point . This particular subject falls WAY short.
5,the best backup there is,"I have tried three econometrics textbooks so far (Johnston and DiNardo, Hayashi and Greene) but this is the only one that I can read without having a headache. This is because aside from its technical contents, it also contains lots of anecdotes that make it a pleasure to read. From this book, I could presume that Prof. Kennedy is not only a great researcher but an excellent teacher too. Even the answers to selected problems are explained thoroughly and clearly. Besides, the price is so affordable. Nevertheless, I would prefer to see the geometry of least squares than the Ballantine-Venn diagram utilized in the book. I also agree that GMM should be included in the subsequent editions."
2,Unhappy,We got the tv and dvd player as a Christmas present for your kids. It worked fine until a few days ago. It states that there is no disc. We tried several different dvds and still get the same message!!! Safe yourself the trouble and get something else
2,Better off getting a cheap Sony,"So we bought this for my son because being a HUGE Spongebob fan we had to have it and well, it was disappointing, it worked for the 1st month and then kept reading NO DISC when there was a disc and also it skipped a lot and the remote had so many buttons for a kid to try to operate. It is not costly but you can purchase a cheaper Sony product for this instead. NOT RECOMMENDED"
2,It's really a shame....,"... that the production interfered with what should have been a fantastic album. The sound quality is great, the singing & musicianship fantastic, but when I get a live album I'm looking for something different from the studio albums: I want to hear the enthusiasm, the kinetic energy of performing in front of an audience. ""Finale"" really interrupts what sounds like a great performance by ""fading out"" the end of the songs rather than continuing ""the flow"" of the concert. If this idiosyncrasy does not bother you than I would highly recommend ""Finale""; but for me it really interfered with my enjoying this album."
2,Tree Ornament,"This product is ok, it is placed on a bush in front of a large sliding glass door to prevent birds from hitting the glass. Unfortunately it didn't work. I had to purchase other items elsewhere so this would not happen and now the problem has been resolved. But it still is yard art."
4,Try and get me,This film was very impressive - film noir with a memorable climax and great direction from Cyril Enfield. Die Hard film noir fans should really enjoy it.
3,Just as long as nobody gets hurt.......,"The title is weak and the ending is lame with the voice over moral hitting you over the head. There is NO nuance here. Every actor has one note.But, the first half of the film is very entertaining with cool as a cucumber hold up guy [Lloyd Bridges]corrupting weak kneed common man [Frank Lovejoy].This is a sure to lose partnership if there ever was one. Lloyd Bridges is a standout with just the right amount of swagger to make it credible."
5,A great book,"A very colorful display of action, adventure, and romance. It has playful characters and great effects, with an ever-twisting plot and fun dialogue."
4,Good collection of stories & elegant presentation,"Like other Disney hardbacks in this series (e.g., Disney's Christmas Stories, Disney's Storybook Collection), the book itself is a beautiful thing. Glossy, thicker paper with silver-edges complement wonderfully colorful pictures and large print stories.The stories are shortened versions of many of the Disney classics (at least those that feature animals). The good side is that you get a sampling of many different stories. In addition, the stories are not too long that the youngest kids will fade out. However, as our daughter (2-1/2 years) has progressed, she is really enjoying longer, involved stories. She has several full-length Disney books and would rather read those than the shortened versions presented here.So, this is a trade-off. If you treat this series as a collection of short-stories, you won't be disappointed (especially with the quality of the book itself). But, the shortened versions just aren't the same as the full-length stories."
4,Great book!,The reason i rated it four star is because when the book had arrived at my house. About 10-20 pages had fallen out. So the overall book quality isn't the best. But that seems like the only flaw in this book. Everything is great. My nephew loves his new book!!
4,I love it!,"I love animals, so I love Disney Animals Storybook!I think this book is very good. If you love Disney's stories, it will be worth readingI"
2,A nice book but not worth buying it if you already have Disney's storybook collection,"I was looking for Disney's books for my daughter and bought both storybook collection and animals stories as well. These books are almost the same, emphasis is put more on animals from Disney in the Animals series but books are about the same. I will soon return the Animals Stories.Otherwise these are great books for my daughter."
2,You would think Hasbro would give SCRABBLE more respect.,"Or maybe it's the Macintosh they don't respect. Having two older versions of Scrabble for the old Mac system 9 I've been waiting many years for an update for Mac OS X. I kept checking the Hasbro Scrabble website, even the website for the European rights owner for Scrabble. For Windows, yes, but no Scrabble for Mac OS X. Finally I see this group package, although according to the MacSoft website this doesn't even exist. Took a chance. It has Risk also, a great game, and Monopoly! It crashes every time I try to load it. Nice work, Hasbro. Guess I'll have to keep system 9 around another decade or so. And will keep using iConquer to play world domination in the meantime."
1,Doesn't run on newer versions of OS X!,"I'm running 10.4.5 on a speedy iMac G5 with 4 times the recommended RAM for this game and it does not function. As soon as I log in to play, it crashes and closes.Adding to my frustration, there is absolutely no helpful support on the MacSoft website.When time allows I'll update my OS like the latest reviewer noted and perhaps that will be my ticket to making this game run (howerver, I'm not holding my breath) until then I'll stick with my lo-tech board game."
3,pretty plain,"Monopoly is slow, but good for kids. Risk is clean and mirrors the orginal game. However it is super easy to beat even the tough opponents. Scrabble is effective."
2,Trouble with Monopoly,"I bought this when I brought home my new iMac just to have a little fun with the new system. I have enjoyed Scrabble without problems but the game I really bought the set for, Monopoly, will not run on the new system. Big disappointment. Works okay on my husband's older system but I never play it since it is not on my computer."
4,Keeps her moving,"My old girl has trouble after a big day playing, but, for the most part, she moves pretty well while taking these supplements. She has been much worse, unable to jump into the car or onto the bed (heaven forbid!). It does make a difference. She isn't crazy about the taste. Since she takes vitamin C in pill form, I crush this and put it under a little canned food with her breakfast. She eats it that way, but not plain."
2,Good for you but not tasty,Our puppy has to have these due to her age - but they are hard for her to eat as they are hard and we have to wrap in cheese to get her to eat them.
2,The clutch is DEFECTIVE ***,"After one return for a new drill and then trying several Drills at the Depot, and two calls to Dewalt, I finally got the answer to why the clutch DOES NOT WORK in low gear - the drill is DEFECTIVE. The Dewalt tech put it this way: ""We designed it to work in all speeds, but that's just the way it came out."" In other words, the production model is defective. I have an old 2-speed 18V drill, and the clutch works as it should in the 0-450 rpm range. The XRP clutch does not work in the 0-450 range. Since low speed has the highest torque, this is where you most need a clutch!! Wait for Dewalt to fix this! They know it is defective, but are trying to tell everyone it is normal. Bad show."
2,no clutch,make sure you don't need a clutch for driving screws because none of the new 18v have a usable clutch. I can drive screws right thru oak on setting #1 on low speed. The only time the clutch even begins to work is on the highest speed and only butchers drive screws at 2000 rpm. Great drill for changing tires
2,Big Power - Weak Transmission,"Ordered this 18v Dewalt three weeks ago to replace a five year old Porter Cable 12v. Received it and put it right to use. Amazed with all the power! Four days later, while driving 3"" decking screws into soft pine 2x4's the transmission stipped out. Amazon was great about getting me a replacement. I've had the new one for about a week now, and it is making the same grinding noise and slipping like the first one did. I can't believe that I was unlucky enough to get 2 defective ones. There is some sort of problem in the design of the mechanism that allows for one handed bit changes. As soon as I finish this review, I'm calling Amazon back to try to get into a Porter Cable. I know they work good since my old 12v drove the screws in that this Dewalt wouldn't. I know Dewalt makes great stuff, but there is some sort of engineering problem with this one!"
1,Black and Decker in disguise,"Dewalt makes so so tools at premium prices. Battery life seems to be shortest in the Dewalts compared to all other brands of cordless I've used, and Dewalt is first to break down. Hitachi, Makita, Milwaukee, and Bosch are all better choices."
5,KNOW WHAT YOU SELL,I WAS AT HOMEDEPOT TO BUY A DRILL WHILE I WAS LOOK AT DRILLS I SAW THAT YOUR COMPANY WAS SELL THE DEWALT 988 HAMMER DRILL . I ASK THE MAIN GUY IN THAT DEP.WHY THEY DIDNT HAVE THAT DRILL BY IT SELF HE SAID DEWALT DONT SELL IT BY ITSELF. SO I PURCHASED THE COMB CIRSAW & DRILL . NOT TO HAPPY ABOUT THAT BUT I NEED THE DRILL . SO WHAT I WANT TO KNOW DOES YOUR COMPANY SELL THE CASE . SO I DONT CARRY THAT BIG CASE AROUND IN THE COMB. PLEASE REPLY.IF CAN. ALSO PLEASE INFO OTHER DIST. ABOUT YOUR GREAT PRODUCTS. I LIKE DEWALT PRODUCTS OTHER DRILLS I HAD HAS BEEN DEWALT.
1,What a joke,The one handed operation of this drill is a joke. In order to make a one handed chuck the brake on these drills is extremly active. Unfortunitly the hard stop feature causes colet to put a slight impact on the jaws causing them to open after 40-60 stops.This Causes the bits to fall out. I emailed dewalt about this problem they refuse to ansewer back. Don't they test these tools befor put them on the market. I haved switched to all makita and no problems yet. I tried to buy american got hammered 1 more time.
2,Still unanswered questions,"Considering this book, one must understand it was printed in 1983 and tell-all stories were not quite so ""in your face"" as they can be now. I did expect, and still would like to hear more about the actual autopsies in more detail, as it is barely discussed in this book. However, it is still an interesting accounting of controversial deaths, but will not answer those troubling questions most of us still debate. I found the first chapter about Natalie Wood to be the most enlightening. She really fought for her life, but still no one has satisfied the original question of why she tried to leave the boat in the first place. I must admit that he did more to elevate the status of forensics than any other individual in his field. Maybe Dr. Noguchi will do a more in depth book in the future and concentrate more on the cases than his troubled political life."
5,Works well,"This phone comes in shrink wrap packaging without the retail box, but still with the manual and wall mount. Panasonic makes good phones and this one is good. I got it because with so many other 2.4GHz phones and WiFi in my apartment building, my 2.4 phone was unusable. Not many people have 5.8 phones yet and so this phone's signal is clear and strong.Good price point for a generally more expensive item."
5,Great,"You know those CDs were every single song in them is great? well this is one of them. Im not saying all of them are hits but every song just experiments a lot, my favourite would have to be Millionare and Go with the flow, they are just great songs with a lot of emotion. The way it is produces is also very good. I would have to say that this band has evolved a lot since there first album. I would really like to give it a 4.5 because i feel that maybe some songs are not that good in the sense that I would listen to them often, but the use of variuous layers of guitars justifies it."
4,Actual Rock 'n' Roll,"No folks, rock is not dead! This record just goes to show that the world of music is not just Angry White Kids, Rappin' Gangstas and Kmart Formula Pop. Unfortunately, we'll probably never hear this on the radio because this band is not mindless or [angry]. Actual guitar players and singer who sings, not screaming just for the sake of screaming. Long Live Rock!"
3,Well..,"At first I was a little hesitant to type up a review because this is the first rock CD I actually have ever listened to and like. After reading some of the bad reviews I left it at 3 stars to even things out. Now I don't anything about the Rock World and how you guys judge music or what not but I enjoyed two songs that were made by these guys. They were the songs ""Go With The Flow"" and the song that has the deers in the video. Now you have to understand that I listen to nothing but Rap & R&B. I always have."
3,Garage intellect,"3 1/2Almost taking their power-chord thrashing grooves to masterful levels, QOTHA prove one of the only worthwhile post first-gen alternative rock acts, underscoring crunchy catchiness with winning production. There are certainly songs that appear, especially later in the record, which tarnishes impressive songwriting streaks, but not to any degree as to not recommend the disc to anyone who plugs in with reckless, and ordered, abandon."
3,I thought i had hit the repeat button,"A lot of these songs sounded the same, as much as I admire the concept and the attempt to do something somewhat new, the songs suffered from being pretty repetitive with the same riff and drumming. No One Knows, Go with the flow, and God is in the Radio are quality songs. These guys have potential, I'm anxious to see what happens with them from here."
3,"Good, Complex, Provoking Rock","Stoner-Smart, Intelli-Rock, Groovy and Hooky. Can't say many bad things about this record... 'cept I can't help but notice these guys sometimes sound like priviledged rich kids. They're sarcasm and irony (ala other Grohl projects) makes me long for Brainy, Ballsy Contagious, Evil, Nothing to Lose music. (Lesser known American Bands who have achieved Cult / Euro Status - ""Hollywood Superstars - Let It Shine"" for example is a similarly challenging and far superior concept CD).Thanks guys for keeping it real. Stay Hungry."
4,"IF YOU LIKE ROCK, BUY THIS CD and BANANAS!","Queens of the Stone Age are the best band to come along in MANY years. End of story.In many ways they are like DEEP PURPLE (my all time favorite band) who continue to thrive outside of the good old U.S.A. Why? Because it's just about the music.There's no fashion statements, no trendy crap and no techno bull. Just good rockin'music!When I heard QOTSA live, I was blown away. They had that same essence which I've only seen in DP. Raw in your face, well played rock music.And then hearing them mention Deep Purple, well, I became an instant fan.Songs for the Deaf and Bananas (DP's latest) are my two favorite discs right now, with every song being good to excellent! Check out all the Amazon reviews for Bananas as well. Just when I was giving up on new music, both QOTSA and DP come through with great new discs. These albums get better with each listen. Celebrate!4 1/2 stars: Songs for the Deaf5 stars: Bananas"
5,Not only just a good cd but a GREAT BAND!!!!,From around here no one knew who Q.O.T.S.A. were. Recently they came here in a concert and blew everyone away. Ever since they came out in 1998 i have been a fan and with every knew cd release they seem to be getting better and better. If you want to buy a cd that is not the same as all the rest you MUST buy this cd. It's music varies and plus you have a cd of the band that is making history as we speak. You will not be disappointed and if you are then you don't like AWESOME music.
5,Pretty Awesome,"Honestly this is the first Queens album i have ever bought. i had heard plenty of their songs before ""no one knows"" came on the radio, but i had never gotten the ambition to go out and buy a cd for some reason. well im definately glad i did this time. ""songs for the deaf"" opens with ""You think I aint worth a dollar, but i feel like a million"" a very fast and catchy track, with screaming galore, and a great continuous riff. ""no one knows"" is second, its a good choice for the first single, i like it alot. the 4th song ""song for the dead"" is also a standout, as well as ""the sky is falling"", ""six shooter"", ""hangin tree"" and ""do it again."" all of the tracks here are good in their own way and i highly recommend it. one of the best ive bought this year."
4,Best record they've done yet!!!!,"I'll start off by saying that I'm one of those who thinks that KYUSS was god. If you haven't heard KYUSS, then quit reading anything of QOTSA and go do your homework on KYUSS. Since KYUSS broke up, I've followed all the members off-shoots (Unida, Slo Burn, QOTSA...) and I've really not been a huge fan of previous QOTSA efforts UNTIL THIS ONE. This is definately the best thing QOTSA has done to date! I'm completely hooked on Millionaire and the single No One Knows...both have that super-catchy guitar hook (like KYUSS always delivered). Other stand-out tracks include the hidden track Mosquito, Do it Again, and Hanging Tree. You wont be able to get them out of your head!! (Which is why I give this CD a thumbs up!)"
5,Return of the Rock,"Just when the world seemed to be overrun by fat guys covered in tattoos acting tough and little guys in garage bands with overly produced and contrived albums, a breath of raw, unfiltered, heavy air has come down from the heavens. It's rumored that Led Zeppelin had a baby with the MC5 during the Led Zeppelin II sessions, and Black Sabbath adopted the child. Now all grown up, and going by the name ""Songs Of The Deaf"", the album is a masterpiece without a moment of down time. Showcasing the talents of three vocalists each with their own style, it shows just what can happen when artists sit down to just make music, not try and save the world (thank you bono) or show off to girls (thank you brandon boyd). It's one of those albums that need to be played loud, because as hendrix put it ""music is magic"" and it'll take some magic to drown out Ja-Rule's latest disaster with some other girl blaring from the civic next to you at the stoplight."
4,It's all been said,"Pretty much everything to be said about this album has already been written previously, so this will be brief.For me this album has some hits and misses, but the hits are huge and keep on coming while the misses barely register.The only thing I wish the band did was keep that opening riff from 'Gonna Leave You' going the whole time. How the hell is that thing still imbedded in my mind?"
5,Wake the F$$K up and buy this album!,"I bought this CD the first day it came out and it blows my mind.Ive been a huge QOTSA fan since I first saw them open for WEENa couple years back. Then at Coachella they continued to draw me in with songs like ""Song for the Dead"" and ""No one Knows"".This is a definite must buy for those of you who are sick of""Clone Radio""! BUY IT MOTHER F$$KER!"
3,Good,"This album has several great tracks, several okay tracks, and several mediocre ones, which in my mind adds up to a ""pretty good"" album. The great tracks, like ""Hangin' Tree"", ""First It Giveth"", ""The Sky is Fallin'"", ""Mosquito Song"", and ""No One Knows"" more than make up for filler songs like ""Six Shooter"" and ""A Song For the Dead"", while some songs proved to be just decent, like ""God is in the Radio"" and ""Go With the Flow"". Nowhere near perfect, this album is still good and I do not regret buying it."
5,INcredible,"I was way ahead on the QOTSA, i got their album Rated R in 2000 after hearing the ""Feel Good Hit of the Summer"" at the Virgin Megastore...I was amazed, my favorite track off of the album was ""The Lost Art of Keeping A Secret"" which was actually the first single...After that album i searched for any others and found their self-titled debut which i have not gotten yet...Then in June of 2002 someone gave me a promo of their unreleased album ""Songs for the Deaf""...I think my jaw dropped while hearing the cd...every track is a killer with guest's David Grohl's incredible drumming...Buy this and Rated R as soon as you can, and even if you're not a metal fan you'll be more than glad..."
5,it hooked me,"my sons cd and and i could listen to it over and over i love the hole thing back to front,front to back it takes me in.awsom,bitchen,mistical,"
3,Queens of the Stone Age: Mixed Emotions,"The product itself (the CD) was great. It was in good condition, it arrived on time. I was recommended this CD by one of my friends when I mentioned that I liked one of the songs on it ""No One Knows."" However, that was pretty much the only song on the CD quite like it and therefore the only one I liked. I would say you have to be into the type of music that QOTSA sings to enjoy this CD. If you're into things like System of a Down, Sick Puppies, or Nickelback, I wouldn't think that you would like it, but you never know."
5,Just Skin and Bone Round the Hangin' Tree,"On my first listen of this album, I thought... Ok, a few good songs, but most of them feel too poppy and similar. On my second listen I decided that about half of the album was actually pretty good. And so it has continued until I have listened to it about 15-20 times now. Now I think that all of the songs are very distinguishable and all of the songs were good except 2 songs that were too poppy and Six Shooter, which was annoying. The negative reviewers that say all of the songs sound the same and are too poppy probably just listened to the album once... and if you like music that is simple enough to be judged on first impressions then you don't know music. Go pick up a Linkin Park cd and leave those of us that have brains alone."
1,fan boy crap,"its funny reading through these 5 star reviews and realizing how utterly brainwashed the fanboys are. Come on you guys...put aside your desire to think you've found the next cool thing and listen to this record for what it is. First, the production is horrible. Hello? Turn up those vocals abit! The singing in a jar thing doesnt work here. And the playing is bad too. On the one song i liked on this cd (song for the dead) the solo is horrible. I don't know who put a guitar in grandma's hands but take it away..please!I bought this clunker because mark lanegan was on it. Wow. Did they ever waste him. I guess mark had to have some reason to keep drinking and listening to this gives him that reason. Turn up those vocals, YO!So to those who haven't heard these guys yet and are going to buy the thing on hype, ignore the fanboy kaka you see and save your money."
1,pull out the sky valley,Don't buy this album if you're buying it because you like Kyuss. I keep hoping with each QOTSA CD release that they will do something akin to their work as Kyuss but it isn't happening. There are a couple of good tracks on this one but more of them are embarassing rather than rockin'. I'll probably buy the next QOTSA CD and sell it to the used shop the next week but until then I'll have to keep Sky Valley in the changer.
1,Songs to Make One Deaf,"Not something to be taken litely, and not something I normally fling around, it's easy to say this is the worst album I've ever heard. It was poison to the ears.At first, I was excited for this album; I genuinely liked ""No One Knows,"" and I still do, despite it being overplayed, and Dave Grohl rocks. However, upon hearing the full album, I was severely disappointed. The drumming ranks among Dave's best. But the rest sounds like someone turned their instruments on, and shoved them into a blender, and let it run.If you want to spend your money on an album, pick up the Foo Fighter's ""One By One"" or the new ""Nirvana"" compilation. Completely bypass this album."
4,Consistently good,"One of the better albums I've bought recently. This is much better than Rated R (the previous album by these guys.) There are some short guitar solos here and there, the druming has much more interesting fills and rhythms (Dave Grohl being the only drummer here,)bass lets loose every now and then. R was a little bit to all over the place and in that aspect, there were the heavy stoner rock songs, alternative songs, and indie/garage rock. But the sound is perfect here and the style is a bit more of a straight rock album on Songs. Think Kyuss with a quicker tempo, cleaner vocals and more melody, less crunch. If that is intriguing enough then get this album. The self-titled is slightly better though."
4,songs for the deaf....decent,"Next to the other two qotsa releases, Queens of the Stone Age and Rated R, Songs For The Deaf is a strong album, but not their best. Compared to Rated R, S.F.T.D., has the same mixture of hard rock riffs, mellow vocals and ear pounding rock that makes the band unique and awesome. Although the songs lack new and interesting musicianship, they still remain up to their potential. i do reccomend this album, although you should definately buy the others first."
2,Can do MUCH better than this,"This album follows the same formula used on the previous two albums - throw in 2 or 3 (at most) good songs and stuff the rest of the album with fillers.The song ""No One Knows"" is the single, and with good reason - there's nothing else ANYWHERE NEAR as good on the rest of the album. The only ones that come even remotely close are ""Hangin' Tree"" and ""Another Love Song"", and they are very different musically.The instrumentation is exceptional but where are the decent tunes guys? I'm not a fan of disjointed, droning melodies and chord progressions.As I said earlier, they are capable of pulling off two or three mind-blowers on each album. The talent is there - so why don't they start using it? I'm very disappointed (again)."
2,Rock ?,"I have a few words to say,First of all let's start with ""over rated""This is a nice CD and for that matter ""R rated"" is Ok too, but so what,... At best this is a decent (not great) rock CD with some creative tracks and a few cool ideas. ... Dave Grohl (yeah, that's nice) but there is something soft about this record, something kinda boring and ""been there before"" that puts me in a foul mood. ..."
3,"It's good, but it's no Lullabies.","If you've just heard of QOTSA and want to buy an album, I'd recommend their newest album ""Lullabies To Paralyze"". The problem with Songs for the Dead is that it drifts in and out of brilliance and the djs' interuptions become nothing more then annoying to me after a while. The weakest album of a great, great bad."
2,Was Hoping for Better,I was hoping this C.D. would be better then it is. Track #2 is the best song on the C.D. I LOVE the vocals and the bass work. If the other songs on this C.D. were even remotely close to track #2 I would have been in heaven. As it is I'm still waiting in purgatory.
3,Good record with a few missteps,"The first two tracks and outstanding and almost worth the price of the record. If QOTSA capitalized on the musicality and rockingness of ""No One Knows,"" (minus its two-minutes too-long length) they'd be the band we're all giving 5 stars to here. There are some jaw-dropping moments peppered throughout, but also some monotony. Indeed, the radio DJ parodies were barely funny the first time, and most songs are wayyyyy too long for the few musical ideas they possess.Most of the tunes here have good ideas but no sense of how to effectively employ them. Ultimately, this is a decent, above average record by a band that may or may not be able to do better."
4,DON'T HAVE TO BE HEARING IMPAIRED TO ENJOY THIS ONE,"The first stuff on this album is a satirical attck on the now entirely commercial radio world. All of the songs are unbelievable, I think one is about september eleventh. The queens aren't afraid to rock in ways that have lately been sniveled at by indie snobs, who don't have jobs. The Queens of the Stone Age pay open homage to seventies metal more than ever. This album refrences Zeppelin's Four Sticks and That's the Way, Sabbath's Supernaut, Am I going insane and Changes, and Blue Oyster Cult's Mistress of the Salmon Salt. I think you have to be deaf to hear the next to last song."
2,It's really grown on me... a true rock album!,"Okay, I originally gave this album 2 stars, but after listening to it over the past 2yrs, it's grown on me big-time. Better than ""Rated R"" and ALMOST as good as their self-titled debut, I'm now giving it 4 stars. And I highly recommend it to any true rock fan!"
5,Amazing,"I have never reviewed anything on amazon before, but this album is so astoundingly good, I feel like I must. I like many types of music, from the Velvet Underground to Funkadelic to Waylon Jennings, and from a purely musical standpoint, this album is of superior quality. As an added bonus, it rocks harder than almost anything I have eaver heard. The music is easily as heavy as the hardest core bands such as Cannibal Corpse or Napalm Death, yet the tempo is slowed down significantly from those speedy, grinding type bands, and the result is something almost deleriously heavy. My personal favorite is track 5 - A Song for the Dead. If you like music - buy this album"
4,"""Songs for the Deaf"" should be heard!","Easily the best rock album released in '02. Excellent musicianship, very cool songs. I'm a huge fan of their previous record (R), this one is right up there, if not better. You should buy this."
4,Good music,What a great CD. It is much less diverse than R but to me that makes it more enjoyable. The hole CD has a very cartoony feel too it. Not going to attract as many fans as R but hey it is still very good music. It is very frustrating at times to have to listen too the boring and pointless fake radio chat witch can keep you from lstening to music. Overall thought it is very enjoyable and I recommend it to any QOTSA fan.
4,Everybody's Gonna Be Happy,"Best metallic 'stoner' rock since Nevermind. Period. Superb manic drumming by Dave Grohl, massive crunchy guitars and even an appearance by Ween's Dean Ween.Now, what every reviewer fails to mention (that said I haven't read all the reviews) is that after the Victorian chamber music sounding hidden Mosquito song, there's another hidden track. It's a cover of Everybody's Gonna Be Happy by The Kinks, and it adds a funny party tone to a collection of mostly serious tracks.At least it was included on my copy, bought in Australia.SPACE TRUCKIN'!"
4,Hell yeah,"I had read somewhere that this album was mastered flat. I don't know if I am explaining it properly, but anyway, that's BS. It does keep the guitar from ""cutting"" through the mix, but that's ok with me. Dave grohl is the best drummer alive I have to say and he should just quit the foo fighter thing and do what he does best. This album features him ripping it up and the rest of the band is also top notch. I am definitely getting rated R after hearing this."
4,David Grohl Is Rocks Best Drummer....Period!,"Having said that....this album sounds like a cross between Nirvana's ""Nevermind"" and The Masters Of Reality album ""Sunrise On The Sufferbus"". Personnally I would have loved a few more fuzzed up guitar licks and solos, but the Johnny Ramone in me said ""Forget About It!"". But still.. rock is guitar so hence the four stars instead of five."
3,"Good stuff, but hardly original","I enjoy just about all forms of rock, old and new, but, folks, this really ain't new stuff. While I absolutely love ""No One Knows"" - in fact, never tiring of it - it borrows from some old school rock like Deep Purple and Led. Again, some fantastic songs abound, although a few duds fill up space on the album. (Thank God my CD player quickly skips these tracks and the silly ""radio bits"" in between songs.)Still, I recommend Songs For the Deaf. I predict a few of the tunes will grow on me over time."
2,Album of the year? Groundbreaking? Hardly....,"Like everyone else, I was pulled in by the catchy ""No One Knows"". If you really listen to that song, though, it just repeats a few lines OVER AND OVER. Unfortunately, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree on this album. It feels like a broken record. The ""Queens"", in my opinion, are an overrated band getting hype for putting out something nobody else has yet. There's a reason nobody has done this kind of music before, though: It's not very good."
2,utterly underwhelming,"don't believe the hype. this made-for-MTV, hopelessly outdated, bland and unoriginal band personifies everything that is wrong with music in general. hey, im no expert, but why waste your time with boring and inane patter when there are thousands of great albums just waiting to be heard?"
3,"songs are ok, but not great","the songs are good enough, but the whole thing of making it sound like you are listening to a radio station is really annoying. i wish they had left off the useless DVD and put another CD in with just the songs. I am going to rip the CD and edit the tracks to take that junk off. In general, I just don't think this band is as good as Kyuss. It is good music, but just a little on the one dimensional side."
1,1/5 Inaudible,"I bought this as a stocking filler for my father (He's deaf).Sadly however, he cannot hear any of the tracks on it...Firstly I thought perhaps it's only for people who are partially deaf... but then I thought; surely any CD is for someone who is partially deaf... you just turn the volume up on the CD player.Then I thought... maybe it's just aimed at being a humerous title although my father didn't laugh when I gave it to him.We had a huge fight and now I've been thrown out of the house.I am completely new to the whole ""living on the streets"" thing... however thankfully I still had my library card so I could come on here and warn people.I'm going to buy the CD ""Living In A Box"" by the band ""Living In A Box"" in the hope that they can provide some insight"
4,Not the best one,"I know I know, it has couple of the most successful singles for this band but some songs I dont know, I mean nick should not sing at all because he makes it sound like its a throwaway song , after a couple of listens it grew on me, but I like better every other queens record"
5,Real Rock N Roll Ladies and Gentleman,"This album f**king rules. The music is great. QOTSA really know how to whip up good music. This album features great hits such as, ""You think I ain't worth a dollar, but I feel like a Millionare"", ""No One Knows"", ""Go with the Flow"" and much much more. I never get sick of this album. And the bonus dvd that comes with it features a few live performances which is pretty good considering the dvd is free. So if you like good music, then get this album and more of the Queens work. And check out their side projects as well. If want to keep listening to REAL rock n roll, also check out CKY."
3,Smoothly Haunted,This CD is feels very dark to me and I like that. I also really like the way this CD changes pace. You can definately hear the Grohl effect. If you like dark melodic hooks Songs for the deaf is full of them. Doesn't hold up for very well to repeated listens - Three starts for Grohl!Tim
5,"Terrific, terrific, terrific!","I bought this album the second day it came out, and I still can't stop listening to it. I'm not sure if it's better than Rated R or not, as this album is very different. After falling in love with Rated R, I was very excited to hear the new Queens album, and I wasn't let down at all. These guys know how to make music that rocks AND is actually interesting. This is the thinking man's hard rock album. Best album of 2002 if you ask me."
4,It really works!,"I trained my son using this method when he was 2 years, 2 months. (My mom used a similar method with me in 1977 and recommended it) It worked really really well! He took a bit longer to learn to go poopoo at first, until I realized that HE thought he was ""making messies"" if he went in the toilet. I solved this by taking him around the house and showing him that the dishes go in the cupboard, clothes in the closet, toys in the toy box and poopoo in the toilet. He totally got it after that.He only had a couple accidents that I recall. I reminded him to go pee pee quite a lot at first, which I believed helped. I stopped all liquid drinking an hour to and hour 1/2 before bedtime and had him pee right before bed and right after getting up.I would highly recommend this prodect to everyone who's ready to potty train. :)"
2,Not successful for us,"I was excited about this product, having a toilet-resistant three-year-old. I was also excited to have an anatomically correct male doll. I think, however, because he is three (on the older side of potty training age) and a somewhat intelligent child, he immediately figured out how to make the doll go potty (literally within 5 seconds), and just became fascinated by the cause and effect of squeezing the dolls leg. He could not have cared less that we praised the doll for going potty. He just wanted to make it go potty again.Aside from that, the doll does leak, as mentioned by previous reviewers. I think this could be a useful tool for a younger toddler (18-24 month old) who is ready for potty training, but if your child is older and therefore more aware of making things function on their own (and also a headstrong child), it is not so great."
4,Very pretty,"I ordered this ring with the intention of trying out different styles for a right hand ring. I was genuinely surprised with the size of it! I was expecting a nice dainty little ring but instead found a larger ring that shines beautifully. I've worn it for about 2 days and it hasn't tarnished yet. Here's to hoping that it doesn't. The stone in the picture is a little darker (as stated). It's actually a very pretty pink. The band nicks easy, but no one is going to look that closely at your ring. All in all, a very nice ring for the price. I'm gonna go look for more similar products to this one."
1,acorn style but not slim?,"i do not understand..... these lugs are the same size as the lugs i use for my after market rims, which require ""slim"" lug nuts. i ordered gorilla acorn lugs when i purchased my rims from discount tire. i then ordered this locking kit. when they arrived i did not install them, i am outside my 30 days to return them. i went to install them today and though the lug nuts are the right size, slim and can fit inside the lug nut recessed hole, the key for these will NOT fit in the hole so i can not tighten the lug. pointless to make a slim acorn style lug and make the key to large to fit inside the hole...lastly. the groves cut out for the unique locking pattern looked like a hack job. i'll try adding photos soon. also these gorilla locks dont have the typical ""G"" recess on their face so you can not really tell which one is the locking lug until you get the key ontop of it.pointless!!!"
1,Does NOT fit a 2010 Camaro,"The 12mm version does not fit the 2010 Camaro, The Amazon fit tool is incorrect. You'll need 14mm wheel locks."
3,?,"Does the edition include the Italian version of the poems? The product information is unclear, and these reviews are all written like marketing copy."
3,Unexpected Poor Sound Quality,"I have bought and used Panasonic phones and answering system for over a decade and have always been very satisfied, so when buying a new one naturally I bought Panasonic, plus this was a great price.Unfortunately the sound quality was very poor, (outgoing recording, messages and the phone itself) - so much so that I returned it. Also I could not adjust the volume on the phone (or I could not find it easily in the menus...)Other than that, great features, solidly built and very attractive.Note to larger people: The phone is also very small, you just might have trouble pressing a single key."
2,Short shelf life,"This phone was not horrible because it was easy to use and program. The buttons were not always helpful when on the phone with an automated system. I have pressed buttons before only to hear the recording say ""You must make a selection...."" I give this product 2 stars because, after only 6-8 months of use, people are not able to hear me so they hang up the phone; or they say that it sounds like I'm ""underwater."" I'm now going to search for another cordless phone, and won't buy this one again. In case the cause of this sound issue is the digital range of this product, I'm going to search for a cordless set with 6.0 GHz instead of 2.4 GHz. Panasonic usually doesn't disappoint, but I can't say that for them in this instance."
4,Panasonic Cordless Answering System,"PANKXTG2631W Cordless Telephone,W/ Answering Machine,CID, 2.4GHz, WhiteConsidering the price, a very good phone system. Some may take issue with the small keys and lack of express dialing for preferred numbers, however, the phone book is a good feature. There are many other features which make this a good value for the money."
1,Very Disappointed with Amazon.,"I did not receive the CD, The Most Relaxing Classical Music in the Universe. I also tried to cancel my order and reorder the CD's that were 1/2 the price but I still received the original expensive CD's. Not at all satisfied and probably will not use Amazon again."
2,More of the most relaxing Classical Music in the world,"Very dissapointed. Poor arrangements. Nothing like the ones put out by EMI, or Decca years ago."
4,smr,"This CD is very relaxing. It is also all Classical Music. It is perfect for someone that enjoys Classical Music, it would not be a good choice for someone who enjoys relaxing Nonclassical Music. We play it during diner preparation and dinner, and also sometimes when reading."
4,classical,"i got the cd timely and in excellent condition, but i didn't like the way the music was arranged that much. i was a little disappointed."
5,I love Ernie,I liked it very much. I like Ernie and I think I would like any thing he recorded. But of course the quartet is much better
5,Cruse Control,Big Grooves in the Big Apple. Great stuff. If you like to groove and love funk and modern instrumental hip hop this is for you.
3,Line drive,"This shows a dichotomy of fleshed-out funk enveloped in cleanly outlined packaging, still totaling a fun but not entirely engrossing experience."
3,Great Read; Just not a Good Textbook,"I am reviewing this book for its appropriateness as a textbook, not just for general reading. As the author is one of the world's foremost writers on the subject of Black Studies, obviously, the book is a deep read and highly educational.My concern, as a former college instructor, is that the book is difficult for students to use (it is not user-friendly). There is no glossary or index, and these are must-haves for college textbooks. The book is too thick to publish as a paperback and falls apart easily. Perhaps making it a larger page width, with more words fitting per page, thus reducing the number of pages, and producing it in hardback can solve this problem."
2,An interesting work but rife with personal opinion,"I respect greatly the amount of time and effort Karenga obviously has spent on this work. A lot of material is covered; however I must contest the statement that it is well written. Many many basic grammatical errors as well as an undeniably wordy writing style at times make this book less than an enjoyable read.I was sincerely dissapointed with the strong sense of Karenga's opinion evident in many places throughout the book. There is certainly nothing wrong with Karenga having an opinion or expressing it, but in an educational work designed to give the reader an introduction to black studies The authors personal passions about the ""right"" ideas versus the ""wrong"" ones relating to the advancement of black society seemed out of place.It is an interesting work, I just find it dissapointing that this is the ""definative work in the field of Black studies"". Still a lot of good information is contained therein."
2,"Overly wordy, author's credibility is suspect","I had this book for a black studies class and wasn't especially happy with it. There is some content, but the author's overly verbose style makes it hard to extract. This book could easily have been 1/3rd the length and still made the points it made.The author himself is a strong Marxist, calling for things like ""people owning the means of production"". These ideas were tried for close to a century in Eastern Europe and created an incredible amount of misery and ultimately failed. Karenga also has a criminal past, and not for something admirable like getting arrested for a protest. Rather, he kidnapped and tortured two women. Among other things, he burned them with a soldering iron and forced detergent into their mouths. (do a search on ""karenga conviction"" to learn more)I still have an interest in the topic of Black Studies and would love to come across a better book."
1,Horrible Writer,"Good god how can this man be allowed to publish such a monstrosity to the English language? It's wordy, verbose, and as I've found doesn't make sense. His writing ability obscures the many great ideas he has. Read this is you do not get easily annoyed with flawed and wordy sentences."
1,Karenga is a chump,"If you really want to educated yourself about the history of Black America I suggest you read BEFORE THE MAYFLOWER, A PEOPLES HISTORY OF THE US, BLACK HISTORY: FOR BEGINNERS, and various others. No only does this self-proclaimed ""teacher"" have no writing skills but because of his own egotism and jealously, members of the Black Panther party were murdered (by bald headed Karenga cronies in the US Party) and jailed. This house boy has no business writing about black history when he turned on other blacks during one of the most important periods of our struggle for civil rights and self-defense. Read TASTE OF POWER, read anything by Angela Davis...read the back of a cereal box before you read anything by this PUNK."
2,Not Great,"This item seems cute in the picture, but in reality it is quite cheap looking/sounding. It is a wind-up music box and only plays a couple of bars of the song over and over, and the tempo is veeeeery slow. I bought it to give as a gift but now I am reconsidering. I am embarrased to give it!"
4,"Stay Hungry, Don't Explode","This is a low-priced, high quality, well made ""Best of"" Twisted Sister cd. Only 10 tracks, but all are original studio versions, great sound quality, and for new fans, this is the perfect introduction to their music. People forget that Dee Sinder and the band wrote some absolutely classic, concise, well crafted hard rock and heavy metal. Musically speaking, the band was a cross between Alice Cooper, Judas Priest, Saxon and AC/DC. Hard Rock anthems were the band's specialty, and they did them extremely well. All the big hits are here, plus a couple rockin' deep album cuts like ""Bad Boys Of Rock & Roll"", ""Tear It Loose"", and ""Lookin' Out For #1"". Sure, a couple more tracks off of the essential ""You Can't Stop Rock 'N' Roll"" album would have been nice, but this cd serves it's purpose well. It's a quick-fix dose of Twisted Sister, in all their 80's, high power, headbanging glory...""Blastin' fast and loud""!Recommended!"
2,Horrible,"Twisted Sister were one of the biggest hair band is the late 80s. This compilation is supposed to be a Greatest Hits. It's not. Sure it has Were Not Gonna Take It, The Price, and I Wanna Rock. But where is Were Gonna Make It, Burn In Hell, or Hot Love. Get rid of Leader of the Pack, Tear It Loose, and Lookin Out For #1. This album is OK for casual fans of Twisted Sister, but for diehard fans or anyone who has ever heard Burn in Hell, it will make you cry."
4,Nice!,"Pat can bring it as a blues and R&B singer, at least for about the first 7 tracks or so (would be a 5 star EP). Last few tracks trail off into some fairly banal territory, mostly due to material, but that's true of many, many blues albums. Some critical sources (who shall remain unnamed, and will hopefully no longer be with us soon) would have you believe this is a terrible record, a misguided attempt by an artist to expand into an area unsuited for her. A stupid criticism, as her voice is full and emotive throughout, and the arrangements and instrumentations are tight and quite good (Roomful of Blues with her hubby Neil is the crack band). This is an enjoyable, fun recording of an underrated artist stretching out, and I'm very glad to own it."
5,Awesome!,"This is one of my favorite albums, period.It's refreshing to hear her do an album of songs that SHE wants to sing, rather than songs that fans or radio expects. Her one concession is the title track, which is really the only radio-friendly song of the bunch.Her vocals are perfect, the arrangements are perfect, and the backing band is perfect. I like hearing what songs my favorite artists like and are influenced by, which you hear in concert a lot, so for PB to do this album, and do it so well, and without watering down the style, is such a treat. I'm sure doing this album was a labor of love for all involved, and it deserved a better fate.The only, and I mean only, criticism I have of the album is the last track. I hate secular Christmas music and this just doesn't fit with the rest of the album."
4,nice sound,"pat benetar's voice lends itself quite well to the blues. tight band playing behind her. the only thing that kept it from being a 5 star is including ""come home for christmas"" on the cd. don't get me wrong, it is a great song, but cut a christmas cd and put it on there."
5,For All Pat Benatar Fans!,"If you like Pat Benatar, then you'll love this cd. It's an old-style big band sound with an edge. The lyrics are great!"
1,Pat Benatar would have had better luck as a country singer,"What was Pat Benatar thinking when she made True Love? It was a real come-downer from her last album, ""Wide Awake In Dreamland"". There is not one listenable track to recommend; as for the cover, Pat looked drearier than Tina Turner or even Madonna in those fishnets.If Pat wanted to experiment beyond her heavy-metal roots, she should have considered releasing a country-western album in the tradition of Martina McBride. Both women have similar vocal ranges. As with Bon Jovi, country could have well prolonged Pat Benatar's career."
5,Two for the price of one,"A wonderful CD showing off PB's vocal range and depth to the music of Roomful of Blues, who serve in the unusual role of backup band. If you like Blues you'll like this. If you like PB, you'll probably like it. If you like both, you'll love it."
2,EXCELLENT VOICE/ANNOYING MATERIAL....,"Pat Benatar is a phenominal singer and she sings stupendously on the CD, but I just don't much like big band music, in the least so her voice could not compensate the annoying material and convince me to like it... The only songs I even remotely liked were TRUE LOVE and EVENING... The other songs just were cringing inducing... YUCK... I was gonna double this as an emergency coaster but I figured if the sales of this CD start to plummet, it may stop being printed and become a collector's item which would be the only reason I would keep it... WIDE AWAKE IN DREAMLAND was a million times better and THAT is out of print... never makes sense, does it folks... Anyways, if you love BIG BAND music than this is the CD 4 u... if not STAY FAR AWAY... This ranks right up there with GRAVITY'S RAINBOW which was better but not by much... Sorry folks but I will stick with the PB I am used to... Change is good but this was way too much 4 my taste..."
1,"This album killed her career, and rightly so....",Pat Benatar recoding a blues album is as logical as New Kids on the Block reuniting to do an album of Gregorian chants. This album never should have been made. Easily one of the worst albums by a major artist in history.
5,Incredibly Cute and Fun!,"My 4 year old and 1 year old sons love this book. The thick interactive pages are informative, safe, keeps their attention, and they leave talking about it. My 4 year old sometimes acts like Little Tex! Much better than acting out a Power Ranger! Buy it, your kids will love it!"
5,Lots of Flavor,"I Get this stuff at California Tortilla. At first the name turned me off, alot of crappy hot sauces or flavorless heat has gimmicky names like this one. But I was pleasantly surprised, it has a mustard tanginess with some decent heat( nothing crazy) I could take some more, its a lil hotter than tabasco. If you value flavor with your addiction to heat, try it its very good."
4,Everyone liked it,"As usual, I took this sauce to work and had everyone try it as it wasn't that hot. To a person they all loved it. It is great on a roast beef or pastrami sandwich. Excellent flavor profile. You should be thinking of things mustard might go on when using this. Not really hot at all to me, but I just stomached a dollop of Da' Bomb The Final Answer so I can't really be relied upon in that aspect."
4,Hot Sauce,This tasted good although it was purchased as a gift for someone else. Not too salty and it is hot.
1,Colon Cleaner Hot Sauce,"It's a bit nutty... Clever marketing, but this sauce is pretty crappy. Given the chunky consistency and the fact that it has the word ""colon"" in the name is pretty much a turn off. It appears to be more the result of a colon cleansing if you ask me. In any case it has an odd and slightly bitter taste. I think it's the mustard they put in it. Yuck..."
5,Ulysses said it best.,If one is at sea and hears her voice -GET THE WAX! She is a Siren. A most beautiful and beckoning vocal quality like no other.
4,New style.. Hikki!,"Actually (when i listend to it at first)I thought this single was so bad..(so strange! yeah)But now, i think her voice still so nice, and this song is so fresh for me.. i listen to it again, again, eh, again....!"
4,a review from a French girl who read it,"L'Enfant from Jules Vallès belonged to a trilogy which he wrote at the end of his life and which contains the following books : L'Enfant, Le Bachelier et L'Insurgé. It deals with a child who appeared as being a scapegoat for his relatives and more generally for his surrounding. The language used by Jules vallès is modern. However, the story of Jacques Vingtras was written in 1875."
5,Sweet little endorphin rush,"Ms. Evingson did a fantastic job interpreting Lennon/McCartney material. She took the tunes and turned them into songs wherein we can re-savor the vibe of this great body of work. Does she pay homage to the spirit of Lennon/McCartney? No doubt. But she is not slavish to it, either. She stands on the shoulders of Lennon/McCarntney, and with incredible vision takes the work to a new, unexpected and sweet level. My only complaint? That she hasn't re-interpreted more of the Beatle library!"
5,BEATLES MUST HAVE DISK,"Miss Evingson has the voice and the emotion that brings all of these songs to life. Her interpretation brings a new side to them that gives you the feeling that she has lived those things about which she is singing ( most notably, The Night Before). She has such voice control that she can split a note into three parts,transition quickly and seemlessly from note to note and ""phrase"" to ""phrase"". Listening to Beatles songs in the jazz style is innovative and refreshing. The genius of Lennon and McCartney are showcased by the adaptation of thier songs to the jazz style. This disk shows Miss Evingson's talent,crossing rock and roll with jazz AND making the songs sound as if they could have been written for this style and not rock and roll. This is a five star, top shelf collection of Beatles songs performed by a very talented Jazz singer, Connie Evingson."
5,Emo at it's finest,"I am not a huge emo fan. Most emo to me is dumb, sappy, and repetitive. But not this CD.Although most of the songs are about girlfriends and breaking up, the music and lyrics on this CD is 100 times better than on most emo CDs. I mean, if you can't relate to the lyrics on ""San Dimas High School Football Rocks"", you have never been in love, ever.My favorite song on the CD is ""1*15*96"". It's such a great song. Words can't explain this song.You must have this CD. I don't care if you like metal, punk, classical, country, pop, or even Phil Collins. This CD is good for every collection."
4,Simply jaw-dropping,"Kris Roe is god. There are few people I can call my heroes. He's one of them. Along with Mark Hoppus, Benicio Del Toro and Julius Caesar. The cd is reminiscent of all the things that make up life. Well the core things. Some might say Kris-when writing these songs-lost touch with other things, due to the fact that many(if not all) these songs relate to girls. It's a choice he made and a well fleshed out execution. Lyrically the album is astounding. It never manages to lose a grasp on reality. It's all heartfelt and endearing. His style of emoting the lyrics comes through wonderfully and he keeps a sense of humor through out. Sonically, it's well done, but a little bland. I think it's a sin attaching a pedal to a guitar, but variety is the spice of life. As I write this review ""End Is Forever"" has been released and while a far better album it just shows how much progress and headroom these guys have to move up. Fantastic album. Must buy."
5,So you say you like punk?,The Ataris Kick butt!!! I recommend this cd to everyone of all ages...even your grandma
4,Keep driving,"...through the Ataris catalog. This their first professionally recorded opus; chock full of amusing and well played songs. It might not be your thing, but how can you not like it?"
4,"Good, but not '. ..here'","great cd, i've listened to it many times and i've owned it for many years. in my opinion its not the best ataris album as the original anywhere but here takes that cake. it has a lot of good songs, but it kind of marks the inevitable fall into pop/punk. this CD was the entrance for the ataris into the radio mainstream world. i'm not saying this in a 'aww . . . punk is the descendants and the sex pistols' kind of way, i'm all for them making it and making their mark on the music scene, mtv or otherwise. power to em, but by all means, if you buy this cd, dont think your a punk underground rocker or some ... like that. you're only fooling yourself. be yourself and enjoy the good music."
5,Greatest Pop/Punk Ever,"The Ataris are my definition of all that is pop/punk. Blue Skies never leaves the first slot of my CD carrying case; buying this cd is worth it. Broken Promise Ring is THE best track on the CD, followed by Last Song I Will Ever Write About a Girl, and San Dimas High School Football Rules. Unlike most albums you hear these days, it's one worth listening to from BEGINNING to END. I can't skip by a song on this record without singing and playing bass along with it."
1,>= O Bubble gum punk......or just power chord pop artists?,"Wow, this is the wimpiest punk band ever.Musically weak and too many my bit&h girlfriend dumped my poor sappy &ss songs. I guess it hits home for the junior high kids. Otherwise, skip the hype."
2,Bad CD,"I bought this cd because I read all the reviews saying how awesome it was. I thought I would give it a chance so I bought it. Little did I know terrible this cd would be. They wine about stupid things in all their songs and it just gets annoying. A prime example of this is ""The last song I will ever write about a girl."" If I were you, I would save your money and buy something else worthwhile."
2,Not impressed,"Anyone who says bsbhn12e is better than so long astoria obviously has no idea what good, well-structured music is. On blue skies, I couldn't find anything memorable to like, the songs all sounded the same and ran way too short. If you like modern punk, this one isn't for you. I'd recommend So long astoria way over this one..."
1,What? Pt. 2,I didn't listen to this because I'm too young to die. I heard some Ataris music a while ago and I was in the hospital for 3 weeks with a broken eardrum. The doctor said something about the lack of talent and/or the lack of good music in general. So I'm playing it safe and letting you try it out.
4,The Ataris' Worldly Appeal,"I'm not sure what draws such a variety of people to the Ataris. Maybe it's their funny, sometimes serious, lyrics. Or maybe it's their catchy melodies. Whatever it is, Blue Skies, Broken Hearts... Next 12 Exits is going to become a classic Ataris album. It certainly wins for their best album title yet, and some of the most lyrically beautiful Ataris songs are included in the track listing. The Ataris are undeniably one of the most powerful forces in 'pop-punk', and I admire them for not selling out like so many other bands in their genre have."
3,"The only ""pop-punk"" band I can stand","The Ataris is a good pop/emo band. I wouldn't call this punk, though. They are NOT like Blink 182 at all so people should quit comparing the two. First of all, they are musically and lyrically much more mature. Kris Roe obviously spent a lot of time and emotion writing his songs. The music is melodic but also has meaning unlike every pointless song Blink 182 has recently come up with. Secondly, The Ataris have not sold out yet but I wouldn't put it past them to do so seeing as they are part of the ""pop-punk"" (I hate that term) genre and every other band like them has. In the current emo/""punk-pop"" scene of groups such as New Found Glory, Sum 41, Fenix TX, and Blink 182, The Ataris is a bright spot but not anything very thought-provoking, profound or brilliant."
5,one of the best...,"Blue Skies... is awesome in every way, just as the first album (ABH), both their eps (LFTF and Let it Burn), and latest album (End is Forever). If you are a true punk fan, you must hear the songs on these albums -- they are just the best. Oh, also, ""Angry Nerd Rock"" makes another appearance on Blue Skies... its previous one was on the ever-hated ABH, but the new version has a cool little guitar riff that makes the song a lot cooler -- but I can't disrespect ABH's version, in its poor sound quality intensity. Punks need Ataris albums like humans need water. Posers stay away from The Ataris!!!"
5,if you have any feeling at all.. then you'll like this band,"first of all, i just wanna say i love the ataris, their my favorite band, and no i don't consider them punk. ... well anywho, i think if you have any emotion than you'll love this band, and this is their best album... in plus i think its amazing that me and kris roe have so much in common... because ""san dimas"" describes exactly how i feel about a girl, and the last 2 lines of ""your boyfriend sucks"" is exactly what happened with me and the same girl... and let me say it sucks having feelings for your bestfriend, especially when nothing can happen, and these guys express that, and no other band does it, and if they do, they cant pull it off like the ataris do... bottom line is pick up this cd, its tragically beautiful..."
4,Best Ataris CD ever,"I absolutely love the Ataris, they've been my favorite band forever. This is probably their best CD along with ""Anywhere but Here"". The songs on here are faster than their later stuff, which is good. '1*15*96' is probably one of my all time favorite songs. Almost every song on here is good, except for a few at the end, which is why I took off one star. But the greatness of the rest of the sogs make up for the few bad ones. Just get this if you are just getting into the Ataris, it's fricken great..."
5,AMAZING!,There is only one word to describe any Ataris cd but especially this one and that is AMAZING!!
5,I love it!,"I think that from the moment I bought this cd from Kris(the ataris' singer), I knew I loved it. I listen to it time and time again. I orinally went to that show to see another band but fell in love with the wonderful stage presence of another band. They are wonderful guys on stage and off. I love every song on the album, it gets lots of play in my cd player."
3,CAT5 Female to Female Coupler,Works as advertised. Nothing special about these. Price was okay. Cover is plastic but looks like metal and thought it was since it's shielded.
4,good mixtape,"50, Lloyd Banks & Tony Ya Yo deliver a short but good mixtape with a few quality songs (most of them are freestyles) and a bunch of quality freestyles. Most of these I've heard before but they're good. Worth gettin a copy.#2 - 8#3 - 7.5 (f/ Scarlett O' Harlem)#4 - 8.5#5 - 10 (classic freestyle that Banks rips apart)#6 - 9.5 (Ya Yo delivers on this one)#7 - 6.5#8 - 9.5#9 - 8#11 - 8#12 - 8#13 - 8.5#14 - 8.5#16 - 8.5#17 - 9 (f/ Skip, UTP, & Young Buck (b4 he was a g-unit member))#18 - 8.5 (got WAY overplayed but this was before that)50 ---- Curtis Jackson -- b. 7/6/76 -- Jamaica Queens, NYBanks ---- C. Lloyd -- b. 1982 --- Jamaica, Queens, NYYa Yo ---- M. Bernard -- New York, NYGGGGGGG - G-Unit"
4,This is a great cd,This is the best cd i have eva listern to if you get it a bargin you ar e very lucky buy it
4,Pretty Good,"This is classic G-Unit material.Only true fans would like this stuff.Get Rich Or Die Tryin and Beg For Mercy are better,of course.But then again,they had much better production.Only one song is bad:Fat B!tch.Other than that,all the songs (excluding the skits)are good,great,or ok.All the songs are not on original beats,but by beats from other artists,such as Eminem & P. Diddy.1.MTV Intro-just an intro2.Green Lantern-4/53.Elementary-4/54.Fat B!tch-1/55.Banks Victory-5/56.Back Seat-4/57.After My Chedda-3/58.Soldier-4/59.E.M.S.-4/510.G-Unit-just a skit11.Say What U Want-3/512.Clue Sh!t-3/513.Funk Flex-3/514.Whoo Kid-3/515.Scarlet-another skit16.Bump Heads-3/517.G-Unit/U.T.P.-3.518.Wanksta-from get rich or die tryin and 8 mile soundtrack. 5/519.Star & Buck Outro-outro"
2,Better...but definately nowhere near good...,"or decent nonetheless. I find a couple of the songs on this CD listenable but they just aren't songs that you can get into. There is no meaning in them that you need to look into. Nothing about life. The guys real, I admit it he is a thug. But he tries to prove that he is real and is reppin the streets when we already know that so that doesn't mean that you cant put some better beats into your tracks. It doesn't make you a ""sell-out"" considering that half the guys that they say sell out aren't even real to begin with but this guy is real and he hasn't sold out. Honestly, I do think he has talent on the mic he just needs a shove in the right direction instead of going out and dissin' on everyone else that has already earned there fame. His albums continue to go down-hill."
1,G UNIT,I do not like g unit because they are not rap or hip hop they are just a few guys trying to rap but sound like they are singing like little girls. DO NOT BUY
1,Que?,For some reason my copy has all Mexican songs. Thats right no 50 Cent just 24 tracks of Spanish music. The case and the CD look legit. Be warned.
2,cover gray,"not a great product,leaves marks when applied to rootsdoes not stay on the hair for more than a day"
4,Works great,It's a great product. Its easy to apply and style into the hair and makes you actual hair look thicker. I just wish it wasn't so easy to rub or wash out.
5,Such a nice book!,"I love Russell Ash's books, and this is another classic. It is so helpful to see size comparisons as a child; it really puts things in perspective. This book is very well done."
2,Slim pickin's - or is it me?,"Was this a bad year or what? Apart from Making It Stick (Inada) the only ones I liked I'd already read, namely Atomic Bride (Ellis)- in the Seriously Funny anthology, possibly - and those by personal faves Beth Lisick and Jennifer L Knox. Some big names fall flat on their faces here, though there's the first William Matthews that's ever engaged me and it was nice to see countercultural stalwarts Lewis Warsh AND Terence Winch, both of whose poems end well - always a good signPublish it not in the streets of Askelon, but maybe there are only so many good poems, so much 'memorable speech', out there. Or maybe the kind of elliptical, fragile poems that tend to see print these days need, like artworks, the surrounding context of an oeuvre to show at their best"
4,The Mask Of Zorro,"This book is all about revenge.It is about a young man called Alejandro who saw is brother murded in frout of his eyes,he sents out on revenge to kill captin love head of the gards .I liked the book because it as action in it .What I did not like about it there was to much talking."
5,Teriffic,"I have seen the movie seven times, read the book once (since I only just got it a day ago), and heard the soundtrack numerous times. And I love them all. This book is teriffic! There are some strong likenesses to the original novel (""The Mark of Zorro"") in it that are very humerous, and they filled out the loose ends in the movie... such as, Where'd Elena get all that money in the end? (It turned out as I thought it would.) This book is a must-have for fans of the movie or just Zorro fans in general. I'm going to read it again, and again, and again, and..."
5,a great adaptation of the movie,"Anyone who has seen the movie The Mask of Zorro will be pleased with this adaptation. The book holds on to the spirit of the movie without getting bogged down with too many background details. The descriptions of the duels come out nicely, and those of us who don't know the story find out how Diego de la Vega became Zorro. The only drawback is the insertion of new dialogue, where the original movie dialogue would have worked as well. A good solid read, that brings back images from the movie."
3,Not as good as their other movies....but,"Jeanette and Nelson movies succeeded more when done in black and white, and especially where Nelson was the hero and Jeanette the kind of damsell in distress..but there was always adventure...great sets and greatsinging...In Bittersweet, Nelson does'nt look like himself compared to other films,maybe his health was not the best ... i even remember this film frommy youth and even then i knew that this one was not like the others.Hey, Nelson and Jeanette only made 8 films together ...so Bittersweetfor all fans is also a must see and a keeper for the collection."
2,More Bitter Than Sweet,"If music was the only criterion for MacDonald/Eddy movies, I'd have to say this movie still could not have made it. Colorful but ponderous, with little plot and non-redemptive scripting, Noel Coward let us down on all fronts. Karl (Nelson Eddy) and Sarah (Jeanette MacDonald) are young newlyweds who flee the establishment to Vienna to live on love with little money. He is a struggling writer, she is the favored singer in 19th century Victorian high society. This spawns trouble for the happy couple when Saxony Baron George Sanders tries to seduce the lovely chanteuse. A duel follows, like none I'd ever seen...it was over before it began. I would have hoped dirctor Van Dyke II could have managed a few fencing lessons for Nelson Eddy to make the scene less clumsy. Of the eight films the couple made together, I see ""BitterSweet"" as the only missed opportunity....."
3,MEDIOCRE AT BEST.,"A near atrocity from the Hollywood of 1940, this filmization of the Noel Coward play retained the beautiful score, but otherwise was so phoney and ineptly done that Coward himself vowed never to sell anything to Hollywood again (he kept his word). At 37, McDonald is meant to be an innocent girl of 18, and the embarrassingly enept performance of the wooden Eddy as the Viennese rake is just the beginning...Here we spend our time watching the actors ladling on their characterisations - for instance: the supposedly starving Jeanette is dressed in Adrian's plushiest low camp creations...The redeeming advantage of colour doesn't make up for the clumsy, sentimental narrative of which fans were duly disappointed: one of the beloved duos unfortunate unabashed flops. In spite of the film's ineptness, the supporting cast is rather good: George Sanders, Ian Hunter, Veda Ann Borg, Janet Beecher and Lynne Carver and, in a bit, Hans Conreid."
4,Sports Center,"The ""Year in Review"" just like watching the Sports Center ESPN does at the end of each year."
3,Emerson still going,"A pricey import which starts out strong, then with live and trio cuts gets weaker with re-hashing of 12 bar blues Emerson style. Changing States from '95 was the dream disc I always knew he could do. This disc isn't quite as solid."
3,"This anthology isn't useful,but you find some valuable stuff","I'm a bit disappointed, because usually I don't like the Anthologies very much, as I hope hearing discographic news from my favourite musicians, like Mr Emerson, more often...Anyway the piano compositions are quite typical and don't add anything else to the historical set by Keith at the Grand Piano. Besides I should have appreciated very much a new musical effort, as He has been producing Tributes or Collections for 6 years, instead of recording new albums or performing live on stage!!Talking about this work, I like the aggressive track ""Creole Dance"" from Ginastera very much;instead the pretty track ""Solitudinous"" is a very sensible piece of sweet piano.Unfortunately the rest is represented by usual ragtimes, boogie-woogie and the famous ""Honky Tonky Train Blues"" as well,Keith duetting with Oscar Peterson...but the recording lacks in dynamics and is sutable for the fans of Keith Emerson only!!"
3,After all this time?,"Keith. I am a great great fan. You kept me waitng all of this time for a solo CD. Now I own it. And I have to ask, why rehash many of the songs I already own, and which sound better than what you've re-recorded here. The recording itself lacks in dynamics, which is your unique delivery/style. Hardly any of these pieces grab me, pull me in the way your playing aways does. I can only hope this was a trial run and the next CD will have a concept, and with completely new material."
4,Great mixes - standout B-side,"Strict Machine was arguably the best dance track off Black Cherry, (no small feat considering this is also the album that spawned ""Twist"" and the infectious ""Train"") very disco-era Blondie with a vicious bass line. Comprising all the mixes from the 2 version import singles this is definitely the most value for the money.The mixes are sharp but the real standout is ""White Soft Rope"" an unreleased B-side. Just as ""Utopia"" nodded to Fritz Lang's Metropolis ""White Soft Rope"" winks at ""The Midwich Cukoos"" (Village of the Damned here in the states - or check out the Midwich entry here on Amazon.com if not familiar). Personally I love Goldfrapp's inclusion of schlocky subject matter and the ""Midwich Children's Choir"" is good fun. Definitely worth the price of the single, and the lush, live ""Hairy Trees"" is exquisite, more like a mix, hard to believe it's live."
3,It's OK,Got this because of a cell phone commercial. It's OK.It is not a full CD but only different mixes of the same music.
5,the intellectual style of a city,"In New York Intellect, Thomas Bender provides a guide to the history of intellectual life in America's cultural capital. He takes it through three phases which are based on the preoccupations of the city's intelligentsia during different periods: first, a city in which cultural institutions brought together an intellectual elite, next, a city with an explicitly literary orientation, and finally, the international capital of culture with an academic orientation. For students of cultural, intellectual, and/or urban history (which I am) this is essential reading. It's a good read for anyone interested in the history of New York City or the intellectual life of a city in general."
4,Very thought provoking look at science and ethics,The arguements presented are can promote excellent class discussions. Very thought provoking. This is a great book for graduate ethics students and their teachers.
3,too technical but good reference,"Maybe it should change ""Web Designer"" to ""Web Developer"" then it fits well.Questions are too fragmented that by being able to answer individual questions does not mean you can design.I like to use it as a reference on what to consider when looking for web designer/developer."
3,Only fair,"This book is OK as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. Although it has some good guidelines in some specific areas it does not live up the the standards set by another book in this series: ""Enterprise Solution Patterns Using Microsoft .NET"". That book covers Web based .NET application design and lists many of the usefull design patterns as well as how they can be implemented in .NET. I would have liked to see this book do the same."
5,Price Guide Review,"The book is very helpful, especiallly formatted for the comic book fan. It is also great because of how it is organized. I think it is as good as Overstreet."
3,Air Gear: vol 5,"Really enjoyed the dvd, it was a great price. The only question I have is, is this ""uncut""? All other dvd's I have in this series have ""Uncut"" on the cover, this one did not. If it is, ok. If not, I have to look for the other version. That's the only thing keeping me from giving it a ""5"". I would actually say 3.5 stars."
4,"A good read, but not up to par with the play or movie","Curiously, this version of Billy Elliot (a novelization written by Melvin Burgess) was obviously written to appeal to young adult readers of about jr. high/high school age, who, strangely enough, would not likely be old enough to go see or even really interested in a film such as Billy Elliot in the first place. This novelization unfortunately washes away the directness and vividness so apparent in the written screenplay. The descriptions interspersed within the dialogue take much of the original starkness of the play and movie away, leaving Billy to seem rather flat emotionally. The strife and hardship of Billy's struggle to attain his goals in light of his difficult family situation is largely defused. Lee Hall's excellent screenplay is FAR superior!! Pick that up and by-pass Melvin Burgess's attempt."
2,very short book,"the book is very short and thin. also, the person reading it is a bit blah. my 13-year-old loved the show and I loved the movie. this book really didn't generate any interest."
2,Not what I expected,"This book reads like a script, not a book. Maybe I didn't understand the description. It does not flow easily and is disrupting as each person's dialogue is prefaced with center-justified, all-caps of each character's name ""BILLY says"" or ""MRS. WILKINSON says""; or stage directions such as ""cut to"" or ""Billy goes off, his eyes full of tears"" or ""she puts the food on the plate"".Enjoyed the movie years ago; absolutely loved the Broadway show; but sadly don't like this version of the book. I was hoping for a regular story that read like a novel, not a script."
4,Emma Goldman,"This book was quite interesting about the life of Emma Goldman, who she was, and what she went through. Came to me in great shape."
5,wonderful album of worshipful music,"Joel Engle has a unique style of singing and presentation. It is worshipful, and filled with meditative music for your listening enjoyment. I heartily recommend his music, particularly this album"
2,Simple,I purchased this CD after hearing one of the songs on the radio and deciding I really liked it. But it sounds like Joel Engle uses a drum machine and it's so very hard for me to get over this. I don't listen to it anymore because of this.
1,what the well dressed bohiemen is wearing.,"i live in a pretty laid back community.all the people are retired or semi-retired.so we tend to dress comfortably.old jeans and old faded rock t-shirts rule the day. so when i got my new army special forces shirt from amazon ,all my friends wanted to know where i purchased it.the patches are really funky,and the more i wash it the better it looks and feels. this is surly one of the more smarter investments that i've made."
2,A LARGE CHEESE BALL COMING AFTER ME,"Actually, after hearing a number of cuts on this album, I can hear a kind of breathing limitation that Danny inflicts on himself that actuates into short tough phrasing. The only problem with this inforced style is that it's like a hole in a fishing net...only some fish get caught, and some will always get away. It's like staying in a certain key for many years....you think you're continually mining new material but after a while, it's just diamonds...never food or drink.Gotta move now...here comes that cheeseball."
5,Dance and Sing Your Way To Sign Language,"Outstanding production with bright costumes and sets. The music stimulated dancing and singing. Understanding and tolerance of others were generated in a positive and fun way. This is a great way to introduce sign-language. A study guide is included. Kids were enthusiastic and motivated even though they thought it was too fast. They commented: ""I wanted it to slow down so I could practice."" ""I loved all the magic ribbons and the songs."" ""I want to learn the ABC's in sign language."" ""The elf made dancing fun."" Best for ages 5 to 8."
5,Really great CD!!!,"The second I heard that the guy from Blue's Clues was making music and had a CD out, I knew that I had to hear it. I think it's awesome that someone like him would make music, and his music actually very good too! It's the mellow type of music and it's cool. I think those who like mellow music should check it out for sure. I like the first two the most, but they're all good."
5,"go, steve!!","way, way better than i'd even hoped, leading me to ask the question: Hey! Steve! Want to go on a date? I won't even ask to see the green striped shirt!"
4,A Review,"The album in question, Songs for Dustmites, is good. Real good. But it's not incredible. Some songs bare more then a passing resemblance to the Flaming Lips such as: Mighty Little Man, Troposphere, A Song for Dustmites, and Superstrings. But others are much more minimalistic such as: A Reason, Stick Around, and Maintain. Go Figure."
4,Yes. It's Good.,"I think it's hilarious that amazon.com has idiotically paired this album with ""Blues Clues Boogie"". What are they thinking?This is an amazing album from an amazing guy. Highlights are ""Troposphere"" ""Mighty Little Man"" and ""Maintain""Honestly though, there are a few too many tracks. Not every track is a gem. This could have been an amazing ep had Steve been a bit more selective."
4,A collection of mesmerizing melodies,"I don't have kids, I've never seen Blue's Clues (I'd heard of it but when you're in a childless house children's shows don't have any appeal) so when I first heard this album via the fantastic interactive website I was drawn in enough to buy the album.I wasn't the slightest bit disappointed. What I found was a warm collection of mesmerizing melodies that would roll around in my head for days. Six months later and it's still in the CD player.Bare in mind, this is very much a first album and there are the odd, fleeting moments, where you wonder - huh? But how many times has someone gone on to produce fantastic music and you've wished you were there when it all began.This album is that perfect begining. If i'm only giving it four stars it's because I know there's better to come."
5,Surprisingly Excellent,"I admit I first checked out this album out of curiosity, being that my 2 kids love Blue's Clues. Heck, I even love Blue's Clues - I always appreciated the way Steve's character approached that show wothout any sarcasm or tounge-in-cheekiness. But this is a flat-out GREAT album. Check out all the layers, sounds, moods and feelings that spring out from these songs. The Flaming Lips influence is definitely there, but that's a good thing. Nice work, Steve. We should all be stoked that Joe took over the Clue solving responsibilities so Steve can keep putting out albums like this."
5,Steve Burns- Musical genius and a really nice guy!,"After much anticipation, I finally own my very own copy of SFDM. It is so hard to believe that this is Steve from Blue's Clues. This album shows every side of Steve; strong, timid, brave, lonely, and fun! I caught Steve's performance at the Graceland when he was in Seattle recently and the show was amazing. When I got the chance to speak to him at the meet and greet I fell in love with him immediately. He was the sweetest man ever and so completely humble. BUY THIS ALBUM AND WATCH FOR TOUR DATES IN YOUR AREA! You won't be disappointed! Steve's website is www.steveswebpage.com to check for tour dates."
3,Somewhat Mighty Little Man,"The best thing I can say about this albumn is that it's not as [bad] as one might expect from a Nick Jr. alumnus. The first 2 songs are pretty darn catchy, but it's easy to name the influence of each song (Radiohead, Flaming Lips,..etc.) These songs are supposed to be about ""science & love""; funny thing is, every 'love' song seems to be about himself. Perhaps this is a clue as to the real Steve Burns? Look, he's cute, but he's just not that fascinating.(I gave the guy 3 stars because the first 2 songs are pretty good.)"
5,Great indie punk album,I listened to this first because I found out about it while checking to make sure Steve was still alive after hearig the Blue's Clues rumors. He is still having trouble dispelling rumors that he his dead. But he definitely alive in this album. Its quirky enough to be interesting. Also check out his great web site.
4,From imaginary dogs to indie music that Rocks,I picked this up because I really liked Steve's voice on Blue's Clues which my toddler loves. I was surprised at how awesome this album was. With a little help from some Flaming Lips members this symphonic space indie rock album was so easy to listen to. I miss Steve on Blue's Clues but if he moved on to do something he is so passionate about the end result is so awesome. I was surprised at how spaced out and abstract the lyrics were with out tarnishing his Nice Guy image from Blue's Clues. Kudos to you Steve. Great Album anxiously awaiting your next.
5,ULTIMATE INSPIRATION,"This Spiritual Journey CD is the answer for anyone who strives not only to be in touch with their Spirituality, but also for those who need to stay in that place. Dr. Williamson's compelling words carry you through some of the most wonderful moments you will ever spend in total peace. The accompanying music is absolutely beautiful and helps to create images that make you feel as though you are cradled in that special place of spiritual nourishment. You will feel connected, and your spiritual awareness will be revitalized. I have experienced several of MacTavish Williamson's Mindwavez CDs and Videos, and they are all incredible. This Spiritual Journey CD is special because the sheer beauty of it is so moving that anyone listening can't help but be touched. I recommend it to every person who appreciates the importance of their Spirituality!"
4,Basic pair of athletic shoes,"I purchased this pair of athletic shoes when I noticed the price had been slashed to about $30. They're pretty comfortable, and I have no complaints other than the heel tab is a little high and sometimes feels like it's digging into my upper heel. (And that may just be attributed to my particular foot shape.) The color was not my first choice, either, but hey ... for $30 ... I'm glad I purchased them."
4,"Tucker, Mac slaughtered it!!! Rock was lacklustre","From the outset Martin Lawrence starts one of the funniest comedies to date. The wide range of comedians from the unknown Chris Tucker (not anymore) to the brilliances of Bernie Mac, Cedric make this a classic. I do not have one bad thing to say about this video other than Chris Rock provided a very wack show, like he did not want to be there at all.A great buy!!!"
3,"Light folk prog with elements of new-prog, but ...","Well this work dated 1993, represented the reunion of this new prog ensemble, which had produced - before this release - a remarkable new prog album on 1991. Well the former clever singer, Sandy Leigh, reminded us of Jon Anderson by Yes and her role was that one of an excellent folk/new-prog singer. Now the new singer, Hedi Kemp, has a stronger impact on the listener in comparison to Sandy, but not in the manner of Renaissance, Curved Air, and so on, regarding of the best UK folk prog of the seventies...that is this new classic folk stuff reminds us of the less busy moments of Curved Air with hints of Marillion, but without the same solid arrangement and impact as their debut album (except on the weak production of this latter)... such stuff is discontinuos, even though there are some interesting music ideas which will be developed better in their next release ""Circles""!!Interesting but not essential release from the U.K. ..."
1,Buyer beware,"This is actually a good collection of songs but you should know in advance that this CD can't be played on any computer that I've seen so far. It has a special label warning about how it can't be played on some systems (no doubt to stop people from ripping it) but it's just totally UNPLAYABLE on a computer, even if you just want to listen to it, as I did. To me, that's a pretty bad rip-off so be fore-warned about this."
4,get crunk,"this album has some tight beats, a lot of average songs, but not too many you want to skip over. lil jon's first song is crunk, and throw it up is a classic. the only christmas one that really stood out though was track 14 (i can't remember the name), but they take carol of the bells and turn it gangsta. the other christmas rhymes are all right, but nothin too special. overall, it's an average cd that's definately worth listening to."
1,Awful to hold,"I bought 3 to compare - so I could buy for the full office. This was the WORSE by a long shot. And it cost the most! !! The photo can't begin to show how thin it is. Have you ever replaced a board on a computer? You know that chrome plates you take out - that's what its like. Items compared: Bostitch Preium Chrome $6.00 (thumbs down - it went right into the garbage); Bostitch Professional Magnetic Staple Remover, Black (40000M-BLK) $5.37 (nice grip, chosen by our engineers as best of three); Westcott Titanium Bonded Staple Remover ($4.83 also nice grip, but its thickness makes it less comfortable to hold - little hands would like the Bostitch pro magnetic one better). (Note: can't find anything magnetic about the Bostitch Pro Magnetic one)"
5,you can beat this,this item works so much better than those claw type staple removers. It lasts forever and is super simple to use.
5,Trying to select the correct staple puller,"was not so easy. I chose this one because Ithink I will have more control over the amountof damage I will do to the paper, etc., I am removingthe staple(s)from."
4,great music,"I gotta tell ya, alot of kids music drives me insane, but both Dragon Tales cd's are great. There is a wonderful mix of music from different eras and different cultures with simple lyrics my son can understand (he is three and sings and dances along like a madman). I highly recommend these. They never leave my car for our listening pleasure!"
4,It tastes like you'd expect!,"While it may be true that most salsas of the roasted variety do tend to taste similar to one another, those who have whetted their appetite on other Pain is Good products would do well to try this one if only for posterity. Just don't expect much heat as this is a truly ""medium"" blend tamed for the masses unlikethat stuff that burns your face offfor which this brand is much better known. This particular salsa definitely works best as a chip dip. It can also be spooned generously over some diced ham and eggs but the sweet, mildJamaican blendis arguably a better choice for that. Like all fine salsas, the flavor has dimensions and will linger somewhat afterward. There's a modest kick on first taste but very little actual heat. Overall, this salsa is a fine choice for fans of that smooth roasted pepper flavor but true heat junkies should carry on elsewhere."
2,Big Bootie Show,"If you never been to one of Uncle Luke's show, than this is the best example of it. You basically see big 'ol booties doing creative things with those booties and other body parts. Basically, if you've seen recent rap videos, than you've gotten the idea. You will recognize some of these girls from those rap videos, if you bothered to look at their faces. Guys will enjoy this selection if you are between the ages 0f 15-35. Women will like it if they like to watch other women parade around half-naked or less. This is your typical T&A video."
5,youth pastor reviews newest book on knowing God's will,"As a local youth pastor I loved the practical way the issue of knowing and discovering God's will was handled by Robert Jeffress. I have read numerous books through the years on this subject, and i would rate this book as one of the best ever, and probably the best book in at least 10 years to come out on this subject. One of the most often asked questions among teenagers is ,""how do I find God's will for my life?"" This book does an amazing job of simply and yet thoroughly answering that question. It is also a great book to teach, because it is so clearly outlined,easy to follow, and practical. Anyone can take this book and teach it in any setting.I think that every youth minister, and pastor for that matter, could teach a series using this book with their people. Again, the book was great for me personally, as well as being useful in teaching it to others, and I highly recommend it."
3,Saddened,"Although this is a well-written book, and the reader does stay involved with the tragedy and mystery surrounding the central character, I had to put it down after I encountered the poisoned kitten. I had just finished reading her husband's delightful book about his cat, Thermal (""The Cat Who Came In From the Cold"", by Deric Longden), and was not (am never) prepared to read about cruelty to an innocent animal.Even if it DID figure into the plot, I feel there could be better ways of describing man's inhumanity than to involve an innocent animal who sometimes fares very poorly from man""kind"" in real life. There's just too much brutality directed towards these innocents in real life; I would prefer not to encounter it also in a work of fiction."
2,Prima Pest!,"I hate this chair. It gets so scuzzy that I have to use toothpicks and straight pins to get the gook out of it's multitude of crevices. The straps are bulky and the harness is poorly designed. The clips on the waist of the straps are difficult to hook & unhook. The cloth cover shrunk. The vinyl underneath the cover is diffucult to remove for cleaning and in order to get the straps off you need a special wrench to undo the bolts. There are very few pros...The tray removes easily but is too large to maneuver in a regular kitchen sink under a regular faucet for cleaning. It is also very porous and stains.The wheels and locks work well.It has a nice recline feature for smaller children but we used the bouncy seat for feeding until our son could support himself.The plastic piece which is postioned between the child's legs is a nice safety feature, especially when you chuck the straps.It seems comfy and roomy if you remove the straps or just connect the straps at the waist."
4,Good Highchair,"I purchased this highchair after reading all the great reviews. I actually have the leather one, but I didn't see it in the product line. I like this chair for the following reasons: easy to clean up (straps and all!), different height levels, I can roll it around easily, and the two separate trays.Why I only gave it 4 stars:After reading the instructions front to back, it still does not fold up properly!! And the tray half the time does not properly lock into postition. You have to really push it in and tug on it to make sure that it is locked into place. Maybe its just mine??But all in all,this is a great highchair for the money!"
3,"Prima? Not for Me, Ma","I believed the hype. And each day that I pick little pieces of spinach (or spaghetti, or pears) out of the nooks, crannies, and seams of this chair I want to start singing Public Enemy (""Don't...don't believe the hype...)! I assure you, wanting to sing a rap song is not a common occurrence- I usually stick to ""The Wheels on the Bus"" or ""This Old Man"". I will admit, I am a little particular about cleaning, especially when it's food-related, but ARRGH!So, to summarize: Yes, it's comfortable, safe and sturdy. Yes, it folds (not THAT easily); yes, it rolls (although not smoothly); yes, it tilts (which was important for 2 months). But,oh, how I wish I had gone for wood or plastic...don't believe...don't believe..."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I got this high chair as a gift and I hate it! It's very hard to get the cushion off to clean. The first time I did this, the snap broke and now food can get down between the cushion and the plastic. It has way too many little crevices for food to get down! There are far better high chairs for much less money!"
1,Over-engineered,"I was given a Prima Pappa chair second-hand by a friend and when I received it it needed a good clean. To get it completely clean it took ONE AND A HALF HOURS! Not to mention the fact that I needed a screwdriver and a toothbrush to do it.This chair is completely over-engineered. As the mom of a now-12-month-old my recommendation is to buy the simplest chair you can find - you'll be just as happy as if you'd bought this chair and spend a lot less time cleaning it. I've just bought a $13 booster seat to replace this chair and am 100% better-off. It takes 20 seconds to wipe down, leaves more space in the dining area and the floor's a lot easier to clean with just a regular chair to move.My guess is that a lot of the other reviews were written by people only owning the Peg Perego chair. Yes, it works, but so do a lot of other, much cheaper highchairs - and with few, if any, extra features than the less expensive models."
2,Don't buy this unless your baby is a neat eater,"We have two of these because we have twins. I wanted the Prima Pappa because I thought Peg Perego equals high quality...and I always want the best. But this did not meet expectations. This highchair is so hard to keep clean. One of our boys had reflux and used to throw up quite a bit. That's when you learn how hard it is to remove the cover, clean the straps, and clean within all the little crevices. And then it's still hard to get that bad smell out of the vinyl cover under the cloth cover.Even though one of the features is a reclining seat, we never reclined. That was a useless feature. When your baby is eating solids, he needs to be sitting upright.The only thing I like about the chairs is that they look nice."
5,Best High Chair ever,This to me still is the best High Chair ever. IT may lasted through three children and still looks new. Great construction and materail. Just love it.
5,Mom on the go...,I love this chair.. We recieved it as a gift from my mother inlaw. My son was only 3mos old when we started using it. And there is plenty of room for him to grow.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!,"I have never written a review on anything in my life but I am so frustrated and unhappy with this highchair, I had to warn others to please save your money. As a mother of 13-month year old twins, I have TWO of these highchairs to clean three times a day. THREE TIMES A DAY, I have the privilege of trying to undo all the food particles caught in numerous straps, crevices, and every other inch of these highchairs. I wish that I had registered for a cheap, plastic, simple highchair that wasn't so ""high-maintenance"". Everytime I clean the highchairs, I end up frustrated and upset. Can you tell we just had dinner??? Please save your money. Things that are more expensive, are not always better. I've learned that the hard way."
3,Love the highchair...hate the company!,My husband and I LOVE this highchair! It has so many great features and is definitely worth the money. The only problems we have had with it was getting the straps out of the cover when it needed to be washed. It got destroyed when we washed it in the washing machine the first time and Peg Perego customer service would not replace it because it was supposed to be hand washed. Well anyone that has a baby knows there is no time to hand wash anything! They wouldn't even pay for the shipping if I were to buy a replacement cover. I was very disappointed in their service and would only suggest buying this chair if you don't mind forking up more money for replacement covers...and then it is well worth your money!
1,mdmommy,"This is the WORST high chair I have ever used! I ended up called Peg Perego with my specific complaints. They are NOT customer service oriented at all! They did nothing for me except to say that I could return it to TOYS R US. Little did the company know that I had been using it for a full year prior. Anyway, I was able to return the chair for a full refund. My main frustration was that the tray never came close enough to my daughter. So, food would drop in between causing a major added clean-up! Us Moms are busy enough and we don't have time to waste. Suffix it to say, the company suggested using a pillow behind my daughter which they thought would make her closer. Well, I tried and yet another item to clean. Forget it. DO NOT BUY THIS CHAIR!!! Save your money and add it to your child's college fund instead of wasting it on this stupid chair. Get a basic, high chair!"
5,Informative Book,I bought this book to help me study for my conversion classes. It's a great way to learn about the holiday cycle and the history behind it. It's an easy read.
4,Whodunit? Nope - more of a Whoisit!?,"Life, for Henrietta Jenks, had always been a quiet, well-ordered affair. But just before her 21st birthday, her mother is struck by a hit and run driver, and Henrietta discovers she's not who she thought she was.This is the third in Aird's series of excellently well-written, police-procedural-types of classic British mystery with the team of Detective-Inspector Sloan (methodical, persistent, an all-around ""good copper"") and Detective-Constable Crosby (young, brash and a bit dim).The best about Aird's books is that she actually gives you the clues (in the best tradition) cleverly hidden in the dialog and descriptions, so that if you pay close attention, you have a good chance of figuring things out. I wish more of her books were in print. Not as depressing as Martha Grimes or Elizabeth George, but equally interesting, and her detecting team manage to be amusing while still ""real"" people."
4,A classic who-dun-it that's well worth reading.,"Like other reviewers I really enjoyed this book. It's probably Catherine Aird's best.Grace Jenkins is knocked down by a car and killed, which leaves her 20-year-old daughter Henrietta alone in the world. Bewildered Henrietta is then told that on the basis of the autopsy examination Grace Jenkins couldn't possibly be her mother- she had never had any children.Meanwhile,in one of the best scenes of the book, the police are examining the scene of the traffic ""accident"", and coming to the grim conclusion that it was a case of murder by motor car.The police have to solve a murder, and Henrietta has to find her true identity. The book is a comfortable read without being too soft-headed, and the dialogue is first-rate. The book is fairly short- there is no unnecessary padding. If you like English village who-dun-its you won't be disappointed!"
5,The Title Says it All!,"This is the second Catherine Aird novel that I have read and I must say I am hooked. As with all English setting novels, the going is a bit slow paced and the writing a bit droll but also entertaining at the same time. The premise of this story is quite different. A woman is found dead in the middle of a road and has apparently been hit by a car. However, the hit and run was intentional. The woman's daughter returns from university to identify her mother and to get her mother's affairs in order. The reader soon finds out that the daughter, Henrietta, could not possibly be the biological child of her supposed mum. On autopsy, they find that the ""mother"" had never bore children. From there the story evolves and the ending is unexpected. Henrietta remains a ""who"" until the very end of the story. The fun is getting to the truth of the matter. It is a somewhat convoluted story and is sure to entertain."
1,Shocking,"I ordered what I thought were at least five sheets for the five tray dehydrator I ordered at the same time. Like the previous reviewer, all I got was one sheet - for $8 plus shipping and a 10% drop ship fee. It came by mail. I kept checking the envelope for more sheets because I couldn't believe it. I double checked the listing and it does say one sheet, but it doesn't state it all that clearly. DEBNROO should be ashamed of themselves. For one sheet this is a rip off. I wish there were minus stars."
4,bang for your buck,"seriously, she packs the bangers in on this one. well worth 10 dollars but maybe not worth more than that. Some of it sounds pretty dated, and there is only 1-2 electro tracks on here. but damn they are fine acid electro tracks, so that pretty much landed this record in my crate, then there are quite a few tracks with Master rush doin the babblin thing, which is cool, but considering he has done that on 100s of tracks if kind of made me less than joyful."
5,love these rafts,We buy these floats every time we go away on vacation - well worth the money spent after you spend 10$ for a donut tube at a resort!!
2,Float...Float...Sink,"As previously previewed, these last for a few days to weeks, but then will spring a leak and leave you bobbing in the pool like a apple at a state fair bobbing contest. One lasted several weeks, but eventually, it too sprang a leak. But they are good while they last....which sounds a lot like my second marriage, but that's another story."
5,Fantastic Lounger!,"I had one of these loungers when I lived near the ocean. Our beach had a lagoon and it was fantastic to take one of these and just go out a float for a while. I love the hole near the feet, it lets you dip your feet in the water while keeping the rest of you out of the water. The armrests and back make this a very comfortable lounger too. I'd recommend it for pool or beach use."
5,Great Float for the price!,"Very Best Float for the price. Comfortable. Great buy. Perfect lenght. I should have bought 4, but i bought an expensive one and this one, the expensive one is a serious disappointment. Great Float....."
2,Not durable,Item just broke. Poor quality. Had only 3 weeks. Very disappointing. Had other intex products and found them to be better quality.
5,"very relax, best toy ever","Very nice toy, and reliable as well. My 2 little girls and myself can get on it, stil float a round nicely. Best relaxing toy."
2,Great size Crappy material,"I bought this float for my trip to aruba to lay in as i went around the lazy river. Within ten minutes there was a puncture. I used the piece of patch to repair it and within the next 20 min of use there was another puncture, aside from rubbing the wall of the pool there was nothing sharp in the pool so i would say that this float was made very cheaply."
1,would be nice if ...,This would be great if it lasted. It was not poked or stabbed or squeezed. Just floating in the pool and within days it died. I read reviews that said this and disregarded it thinking something must have happened to deflate them. Apparently not though. We were very careful with this. At first thought it was wonderful. Comfortable and relaxing but only for a few days. Very frustrating to waste the money.
1,junk,came apart at the seams within 2 months. complete garbage. didn't last one summer before it came apart. complete waste of money.
3,"Love it, but...","We keep buying these year after year. They're great! Comfy, large, not unattractive. But they have one awful weak point: the attachment of arms to body.EVERY year they rip in the exact same place. For the most part they last the summer, but they seem to be getting thinner and thinner.I'd feel better if they were a little less expensive...But I really do like them!!"
5,super fast delivery,I ordered this float on Amazon mid-morning Thursday. It was expected to arrive on Saturday which I thought was really quick. It just arrived-about 6pm Friday-what fast service! It looks exactly like one I had for several years-that I paid much more for. Hubby is inflating it now-can't wait to use it. Glad I found this one-floats are getting scarce in stores and we are expecting a heat wave.
4,Good lounges for the pool,"They don't last more than a season or two, but they are very comfortable and fun! And the price is right."
2,"If it doesn't leak, it's great, but.....","I purchased two of these floats, and while one of them has been great, the other had a leak from the very first day we used it. Granted, they weren't terribly expensive. But, it would have been nice to use it at least once before it sprung a leak!"
4,Nice Float,"This float is nice. Not quite as sturdy as the other one I bought, but it will do well for a couple of swimming seasons! I also bought this one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KHZ044/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i02"
4,great size for women and kids,"Bought this as an extra pool float for the kids. I would say it is big enough for an average sized woman or young kids and teenagers. My under ten year old fits on it nicely and has a little room left. I got on it and would like something a little longer for real lounging but it was nice. The kids are having fun with it. We went to the beach and neglected to take ours, but we saw another family walking to the beach with three of them."
5,Simple designs are usually the best,This coax grounding block is simple and should last years if the cables that are connected to it are properly protected from moisture intrusion. The block itself is one solid piece so there are no joints or holes for contamination to enter if you use good boots and dielectric greasePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.which can also be found at local auto parts stores.
5,not easily satisfied - this antenna has been a happy find,"it pulled in more channels than expected. that alone spurred me on to replacing the light weight pole i mounted it on. the flimsy pole wobbled in the wind which caused 'break up"" of the signal. the replacement pole is solidly sturdy. with only a faint signal loss in only the heaviest winds.at end. i`am so happy not to have a cable bill."
1,Not satisfied.,"The picture made these earring look different colored. When I received these earrings, they were silver... and very flimsy. I could easily bend and break them. I'm very disappointed."
3,THE HAWK THAT DARE NOT HUNT BY DAY,This book is about William Tyndale getting Bibles to England in the sixteenth century. William Tyndale is a preacher who wants to bring Bibles over to England that everyone can buy. He accomplishes this by smuggling the Bibles he has translated and printed over in a ship called the Black Pearl. This story mainly focuses on the captain of the ship and his nephew who smuggle the Bibles for Tyndale. This story was slow to get going but was okay by the end. I would recommend it to people who like historical fiction.
1,not a story about Tyndale,"I was interested, expecting this book to be a historical fiction about Tyndale. I knew the main characters were fictional, but expected their lives to be integrated with Tyndale's in a way that would show me more about who Tyndale was, what his life was like. No. This is just a novel - and a bland one at that - that makes up a story about helping smuggle Bibles, but the story is only about the shippers exploits."
2,guidebook factory,"The idea of a totally comprehensive listing of California campgrounds is a great idea but this book fails when it comes to accurate information. I really question whether the team of writers actually visited the very campsites they describe. Too ambitious an undertaking, needs editing and streamlining."
2,Bad Information,We tried using this on our last two campouts and both times found the directions useless. The state map and California State Automobile Association camping book proved much more reliable. Granted this book contains mounds of information but striking out two times has me puzzled and distrustful.
2,Dead End,"Over the last few months my family and I have tried various outings in this book and found many errors - wrong turns, closures, vague directions. I have given up using it, can't afford to waste the time. An overhaul is sorely needed. I have to rate it two stars."
1,For Fishing Fanatics Only,"Stienstra seems to think people only go camping to go fishing--it's clearly the reason he goes. A campsite could be a pit, but if there's trout nearby he gives it a high rating. He never lets you know if the water is swimmable (i.e. above 55 degress)--something people in Northern California need to know in the summertime. He also gives something a high rating if the area it is in is nice even if the campsites are horrible. I've been disappointed many times using his book, yet there is no real competition for his book as it's the only really comprehensive one on the market. I wish someone else would tackle (no fishing pun intended there Tom) this subject."
1,What happened to the Mellow Man??,"This cd was a horrible dissapointment. Mellow Man Ace has all but abandoned the bilingual skills and wit he has displayed in the past in an attempt to sound more like a legitimate gangsta. What he sounds like is my neighbor rapping in the shower while hoping his mom does not hear him.Strong language may have supplanted talent in pop-rap music, but I ain't buying. This is why L.L. will always be one of the best. He never forgets how to rap."
1,"Serious Contender ""Worse film of all times""",Forget about Battlefield EarthThis is the real mccoy. It is so bad that hurts.I think that all involved should be arrested and made to watch it again and again
4,John Kay: an example in persaverence,"John Kay is the type of person whom we can all admire..His oddesy began in the scrap heap of post war Germany at his birth and lead through many twists of fate and planning to great wealth and fame as a trailblazing rock icon, only to see his integrity jeopardized by money seeking former band members trying to cash in on his good name.John rolled up his sleeves and got back the respectability that he deserves. John kay had a front row center seat during the most creative period of rock music. His vignettes about toking with Jimi Hendrix, sharing a bill with the Doors and life behind the scenes of the Ed Sullivan shows were fascinating..In the end the biography is about a man who has walked the walk, taken some tremendous hits but who has never given up or given in. Anyone interested in this golden age of music will read this book in 1 sitting..."
4,"A good, honest book but...","...a little disappointing. For women who are 50+, very obese, or who have never done any serious exercise before, this book is very good. If you're moderately active or fit, though, it's probably too basic for you already.While the information on diet is valuable for women (without any of the hype or junk science found in many books targeted toward men), the exercise program is very, very basic and is unlikely to challenge advanced beginners and beyond. Even as a beginner, if you follow it regularly, you may find yourself outgrowing it quickly.I'd recommend borrowing this book from a friend or from your library, and definitely read the nutrition information. But for exercise, I'd suggest one of the books by Suzanne Schlosberg and Liz Neporent (""Fitness for Dummies"" or ""Weight Training for Dummies"") instead."
1,TOO SIMPLE & VAGUE,"I borrowed this book from the library...I'm so glad I didn't waste my money on this book. For one, I think it is for ""obese"" people wanting to lose weight. The information is basic common sense, nothing new. If you want to shed a few pounds quickly...don't buy this book. I lost most of my weight from the Atkins plan. Though I'm off that plan...a low-calorie diet of no more than 1050 calories per day worked for me. I went from a size 14 to a current size 3. I figured this book would help with toning up my body...but there are very few strength training exercies. The author of the book talks about her studies and her constant preaching of how well strength training is beneficial. How about including more strength training exercies, instead of mostly writing about how beneficial they are. I would encourage you to check this book out at the library before purchasing it."
1,SUCKS !,"eXCUSE ME , lose weight it sayz !!!! Yeah right !!! This book does not help you , period . You try and follow these stupid excercise and in the end nothing !!! Zilch , NADA !!! Whooopppeeee , strong women stay slim !! WIth a book like this no no no no WAYYYYY !!!!"
3,"Good ideas in the book, just not necessarily applicable to m","I did enjoy Strong Women because it made sense. Rather than focus on eating habits (though there are sections devoted to good nutrition and balanced diet), Dr. Nelson suggests a regular, low impact regimen of strength training for women, with an emphasis on losing inches instead of pounds. Just twenty minutes a day, three days a week is what the good doctor prescribes, with additional exercise optional.Did it work for me? Not really. Though the exercise regimen did help tone my body, I did not get any smaller. It took parts of this program, part of Weight Watchers, and parts of Marilu Henner's book for me to see any results."
3,Gave Away,"To be honest, it was not what I expected, so I gave it to a friend. The book arrived in good conition, so I cannot complain about that."
1,Look elsewhere for weight training guide,"I bought the book from a book club and thought it was about weight training for women--I already know about aerobics, stretching and diet, and thought I had found a resource to help me with some basic weight training for women, perhaps along the lines of ""Weight Training for Dummies"". Well, for that purpose, it is a TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. If you are seeking weight training that will enhance your overall fitness program, look elsewhere (fortunately, I found a book by Joyce Verdal and am currently getting outstanding results)...if you know nothing about exercise, fitness and diet, this book would be a good all-around introduction, but the weight training part is inadequate (only 6 exercizes and a few pages--most of the book, as I recall, is recipes!)"
3,IT'S OKAY,I BROUGHT THIS BOOK THINKING IT HAD SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THESE BOOKS OUT THERE AND I ALSO READ THE REVIEWS FROM HERE ABOUT THE BOOK AND I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED. I'M SORRY I WASTED MY TIME IN PURCHASING THIS BOOK. BUT ANYWAY THIS A VERY BEGINNER'S BOOK.
4,good beginning,"I have found this book very heldpful in getting me on the road to being fit. I have followed the ten week program which is simply laid out and easy to follw. I am much stronger, I've lost 7 pounds (I'm not over weight) for the first time in my life I excercize reguarly and look forward to it. The weight lifting is very simple and definetly for beginners but as time has progressed I have added more excercizes, while keeping the basic program. I am really sorry to read the negative reveiws as it might keep some one who really needs some help motivating from buying the book. I personally think the simplicity and ease of the program is what has kept me motivated. Also the food part of the book is very easy, and for once it does not have starvation in mind.(like so many diet books)"
5,AWESOME!!!,"Just what the Doctor ordered!!! She is right!! I am finally losing weight after struggling forever & ever these last 3 years. Between eating properly & doing the weight training I am suceeding!!! Buy this book if you are stuck & feel like you will never ever ever lose weight, like you will never know what it is like to buy slim clothes again. Yes you will, you will not be disappointed."
5,Ignore the scale!,"This book drives home the message that muscle mass is the key to staying slim. I have no argument with that. Just be forewarned that since muscle and bone weigh more than fat, you may find (as I have) that I gain WEIGHT while losing SIZE. But then, I don't CARE whether I weigh 120 lbs or 220 lbs as long as I'm a size 10..."
3,Not my cup of tea,"Bought this book to use for an online class. It has some interesting ideas and ways of getting into writing a story, but it didn't work well for me. Not my style. Its not a bad book but I don't think it will necessarily have a universal appeal. There were many others in my class who thought the same thing."
3,dont believe what you see,"This cover is not like the picture, it is like a box cover, and the color is way off as described."
5,Machine Robo Revenge of the Chronos 2,"It just keeps getting better and I didn't even know how It could get any better. The color, style, design, character development, Wow what a great DVD!!"
4,Very Nice Opening,After seeing this first volume I can understand why the buzz became so huge right away. This opening volume really set the stage for a story that I'm going to be interested in seeing more of. The characters were fun and this volume started some mystery that I'm now just as curious as the characters are to solve it. This is one that I'm suggesting everyone keep a close eye on.
1,"""Chinese"" quality","What's to say, it lasted 2 weeks of use in a stable environment (my bedroom, on the bedside table). Connector simply seperated due to lousy construction and quality...Great Price, but what's the use if it breaks."
4,So Many Talented Actors,"This was a fun ""Melting Pot"" of seasoned actors versus cross-over Rapper/Actors. I've always enjoyed watching this movie since the first time I saw it many years ago. It's just one of those venues that you can't get out of your system. Fun entertainment & good plot! It was nice to see another side of some of those hard-core Rappers."
3,Nasty Boys,"Whew, this is a nasty movie! It's extremely profane and doesn't feature one nice guy in the bunch, just a group of extremely low-life people.Bill Paxton, William Sadler, Ice Cube, Ice T and the rest of the cast cuss and shoot each other in an abandoned warehouse for much of the film. There is no one to root for and Paxton's character is the only one who has at least a shred of conscience.Having said all that, the film did keep my attention, to say the least. I have to admit: this was a very interesting story. If you're in a violent, testy, irritable, hostile mood and you want a movie to go with it, this is it! Get out your hostility!"
3,"""Trespass"" DVD Review","Two Arkansas firefighters come across a map that leads them to stolen treasure in an East St. Louis tenament. Only problem is that within minutes of their arrival, they become witnesses to a murder and are boxed in by a team of trigger-happy thugs (led by Ice-T's ""King James"") who have no idea about the gold. The premise is simple but a solid cast and suberb execution courtesy of director Walter Hill make this more than just your standard urban thriller. Paxton turns in a likeable perfomance as the more good-hearted of the two fireman while Ice-T and Ice Cube play well off each other as two gangsters with rival agendas. The new Universal version of the DVD has a collection of deleted clips, a ""making-of"" featurette, and a music video so those who picked up the Goodtimes version may want to look into double dipping on this one."
3,"not for the lovers of 380's,450's and 560's","i bought this book for info on the 70-80's sl cars and to learn about differences and see alot of pictures. i am returning it for it had little to none of what i needed. this is a book for the 230,250 & 280 lover. also good foundation info and the beginnings of the sl's.

1,Poor performance - a gas cylinder lasts about 1 day,"The product description sounded good, but in my unit, the argon gas cylinder last for about 1 day. So it works out at about $4 a go... Also the unit is very bulky. The gas dispense sits on top of a cheapo insulated container. Would have been far better if the gas unit was a small self contained unit, that you could use to just inject a small amount of argon into the bottle, before putting the cork back in."
1,Good idea,"bad implementation. Everytime I store a bottle of wine I need to use a new gas cilinder, not very cost effective in my opinion, unless you are keeping an expensive wine.I like how the bottles are displayed, though."
4,i like this book,"Book has a lot of good sources of informatiom , it helped me discover new ideas and it is also a good guide ."
2,Plenty of nothing,This book contains a few good tips and the rest is interviews with people about their specific situation which might not pertain to yours. It certainly did not pertain to mine. Very disappointing.
1,Talentless Bimbetts,"If you like talentless bimbettes, then you may like some girls. if you want women who know how to rockit and sockit then check out the donnas.thank you, this is my review of Talentless Bimbette's some girls's."
3,Sneakers and Tube Tops...Donuts and Beer...,"Maybe that's a stupid way of saying it, but as a Juliana Hatfield/Blake Babies fan, I feel that ""Feel It"" is a nice transitional album for these 3 talented ladies. Some Girls is a great detour and a handy cd to have in your collection, if you are a fan of Hatfield or Freda Boner, or any of their respective bands. Tracks that really stand out are ""Prettiest Girl"",""Malted Milk"" and ""The Getaway,"" which I recently heard while shopping in the GAP. Other songs like ""Robot City"" and""On My Back"" become a bit lost in repetition. In all, buy this record for the soundtrack of a Sunday drive or an afternoon picnic. It will perk up the blues in your dreary day."
5,Well-sung danceable Christmas music,"I bought this album on tape years ago, and liked it so much I bought it on CD. Hugo Blanco takes Puerto Rican and Venezuelan secular Christmas music and arranges and performs it well. The singing is on pitch, which isn't always the case for some of the original recordings of these songs. The vocal arrangements are terrific. The instrumentation is fun and makes you want to dance. He uses Venezuelan instruments (harps, etc.), instead of Puerto Rican cuatros, but it's enjoyable. There are some goofy synthesizer parts, but the general arrangements are so good it doesn't matter."
3,Very powerful and overwhelming,"Barbara Taylor Bradford has given the public a serious way to look at how corrupt people are. Cyrus locke, for what he did to Mary Ellen(countess Zoe) should have been the one to have committed suicide. Sebastian had no idea who his mother was so he was not at fault. He had every right to have an affiar with a beautiful woman, but not knowing who she really was or where she came from. Then at the same time, Barbara Taylor Bradford made him seem like a philandering bum. Women of every differrent kind she semmed to suggest: married, divorced, separated, and even Vivienne, the son of one woman he wanted to marry himself. Overall Dangerous to Know has the power to keep you wanting more and more-you wan't put it down and you'll be surprised at what you find out."
3,Old Plot in Modern Dress,"This plot is nothing more than the Oedipus myth updated to contmporary times, with a little of the Electra complex thrown in for good measure. The only mystery is why it would try to be passed off as something new. It is mainly a series of character expositions told in the first person. The book is so fraught with coincidence and chance meetings as to be unbelievable. Still, despite occasional bits of purple prose and too graphic sex scenes, Miss Bradford manages to hold the reader's interest. This should really be classified as a Gothic romance, not a mystery"
1,Boring to know,"To the best of my knowledge this was the first BTB book I have encountered. If this is a typical sample of her work I cannot understand why she is a bestselling author. Monotonous and melodramatic. I actually detested the main character, Vivian. Hope that she might drown to death in her ""oceans of tears"" was the main reason I continued with the book. Sadly, she lives on."
5,2 great guided meditations,I purchased thisJourney to Sacred Mountaincd by Kathleen Milner from Amazon in January 2008 and continue to enjoy it. It contains two ancient egyptian meditations. Journey to Sacred Mountain (33 minutes) is based on the Native American 20 Count to call in different realms of Creation. Ancient Egyptian Meditation (30 minutes) uses Egyptian Symbology to take the meditator deeply within to explore archetypal energies.
2,it's china spec,cuz it's china spec it's low quilaty i give it 2 star for the size it's the best sizeif it's nokia's oem internationl spec it will be high quilaty
4,GOOD PACK,"IVE USED IT FOR CAMPING/CANEOING & ALSO IN COLLEGE THIS THING WORKS GREAT, PLENTY OF STORAGE ALMOST TO MUCH SOMETIMES, I AGREE WITH WHAT MOST REVIEWERS SAID ABOUT ALL THE BENEFITS, MY ONE PROBLEM IS THAT THE LITTLE PLASTIC DEALS THAT THE STERNUM STRAP IS ATTACHED TO PULLED OFF THE PACK ON ONE SIDE"
3,Not for the short,"Too big for the vertically impaired. I wanted a big bookbag but this is humongous! Great quality as expected from Jansport but at 5'3"", it's overwhelming. My husband uses it now."
4,backpack with a lot of pockets,"My husband didn't like this backpack because it had too many pockets. I find it to be durable and large enough to pack for a weekend trip. It does have a lot of pockets, but that doesn't mean it's not a good pack."
2,Ehhh,"This strategy guide is definately not the best one for the game. It has what you need to beat it, but not enough detail. The maps totaly bite and the strategies don't always work. If you want my advise get the Versus' Books guide for this game."
2,Don't Buy The Book...,"Don't waste your money on this book, it don't have all the info of the game and missing some of the area on the game. goto gamefaqs.com , there is a walkthrough that is more usefull then this book."
5,Lifesaver,"This book takes you step by step and the descriptions are clear. Although it may take a while to acutally complete the game while trying to read a player's guide at the same time, it does not take away from the excitement.And a big plus would be that this guide doesn't take away from the plot. BEWARE those that do!"
5,"Great guide, detailed with nice screenshots!","If you ever want to get a 'Zelda:Ocarina of Time' strategy guide, get Prima's because it has the complete walkthrough ( very detailed ), the locations of all the Gold Skulltulas and Heart Containers, and much more! This book is totally recommended if you are having trouble to beat the game."
2,why don't u listen to the mistakes in this guide!!!!,"first off,this is the worst guide if u want to get everything in the game,i have every guide for the game(don't ask me why i collect guides for a living)and this one would rank dead last in the collction of LOZOOT guides,the only thing that was good about this guide was it had good dungeon strategies and that's about it.the best guides for the game are the one by versus,nintendo,and bradygames.the best one though is VERSUS book because it has no spoilers,which prima loves putting in there guides,the versus one has a complete walk through of when to get every gold skultulla and when to get the spells and heart pieces in game,the prima guide just tells u how to get the hearts and spells and skultulla's,not when and it put's all the spells and hearts and skultulla's in an appendix,not into the walkthrough in guide,i wuz so mad,just don't buy his guide if ur looking for a good guide.if u have a problem with that IM me,my s/n is CAMSTUN187."
4,Zelda Ocurina of time,Good strategy guide with almost everything you would need to know. It was in seriously used condition with pages out but amazingly still there. Would of liked to know or see a few of the pages to tell how much information was given and will probably want another brand of the book to find even more information into other things to do in the game. All in all it was a good purchase even looking at the fantastic clearance price the seller got it at!
3,Overly basic. Fairly good guide though.,"This is a nice guide, but I recommend the one from Nintendo Power most of all. This one...is OKAY. Strictly OKAY. I recommend it to people who have no idea who ""Link"" is. It's really a guide for 9-year-olds who don't care about the nook and cranny, only about ""killing that mean mean man."" I especially liked how the guide went into slight detail on the bosses, but...get the Nintendo Power guide. Really."
4,Fantastic,"This is a really good guide, I had a copy of this, but it was like five years old, and the pages fell out. But before, it was really a good guy, and it helped me out of a few tight spots. The one thing I think it could have is more puzzle-help. Especially the one in Forest Temlpe, the one where you have to move the crescent blocks. But, it might have had it, that pages has been missing in my copy for years. Overall, excellent. Highly recommended. Being a kid (-13) myself, I can say that most kids will find this easy to understand and comprehend, and the complete maps, listings, and charts are very clear!"
1,It was a simple walkthrough with a lack of secrets and trick,I didn't benefit from it in the slightest manner
5,Great Strategy guide. A must read!,"A great book, it leads you through everything there is. I beat The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time in about 1 week and 2 days. It is an amazingly accurate guide that will bring you through the entire game with no confusing sentences or unreliable suggestions. Every known secret is revealed within the pages of this guide. A must read!"
5,This guide was very helpful in playing Zelda.,"Prima's guide had information on everything in the game. I loved it. The instructions and tips were great. It explained how to get all of the weapons, skullwaltalas, and pieces of heart. It gave the locations and instructions for all of the mini-games. It was very thorough and I think it was worth getting."
2,This book does not give enough details.,The bookoften forgets to tell you important steps that you must take. I'm currently looking for a better guide.
2,Lacks the Bravo of Trekdom,"I have been a fan of Star Trek, and of course the music of Trek. But I would have to say that the most recent soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith lacks the inspiring qualities that makes the Star Trek music great. Goldsmith like the other four soundtracks that he has done has the classic Trek music from Star Trek: The Motion Picture, but with the digital sound that is created, the music at times falls flat. Although I have not seen the movie at the time of writing this, if this is and could be the last movie of the TNG Crew, you would think that Goldsmith or at least Paramount would at the very least put more effort the soundtrack. I would also have to mention that the movie itself is intending to be just under 2 hrs of movie time, and the soundtrack is less than an hour, that is terrible. Goldsmith you did okay, but this is certainly not your best work."
5,"Sight unseen and UNHEARD, I WILL buy it!","It's Goldsmith...the man can do no wrong...well, there was that little score to ""Chain Reaction"" of which he must be forgiven.In the meantime, the latest installment of the ""Trek"" saga is definitely a better film due to Jerry's involvement. Advance ""buzz"" says that this is one of his best."
3,This soundtrack lacks the one song I really wanted,"I would like to meet the production genius that decided not to include Blue Skies sung by Brent Spiner on the soundtrack. I specifically purchased it assuming that it would be on the CD. I tried to find a list of the title tracks and was surprised that Amazon did not have that important information available. So far, the experience has stayed true to my usual dismal luck."
1,Great film but poor score,"Goldsmith always manages to pull off great scores for the Star Trek movies and Next Gen, Deep Space 9 and Voyager tv series. But he fails in so many levels to capture the excitment of this action packed film. Maybe hes getting old or lacks the exuberance he once had. After doing hundreds of film and tv scores I dont blame him if he lacks originality. Star Trek the motion picture still stands as his best for the Star Trek movies. Hope you can come out with more originality in his other film scores."
3,Not Goldsmith's best but still pretty good,"What I missed in this soundtrack was a main theme. First Contact had a beautiful reoccuring theme throughout the film. I don't have the soundtrack to Insurrection, so I can't recall if it did or not. The fast-paced action sequences are really good, with a hint of electronic synthesizers in the background. Goldsmith has a tendacy to stretch out music for certain scenes so some parts may seem overly long (like strings taking forever to resolve themselves). Not his best work, but certainly entertaining. Don't recommend for the road--strictly for private listening on headphones. I say that because some movements are really low and you have to boost the car's radio really loud to hear it then you run the chance of blowing your speakers when that loud, crashing movement out of nowhere comes along. I almost made that mistake in my car... :-)"
4,Almost as good as Goldsmith's first foray into TREK!,"Jerry Goldsmith's score to ""Star Trek: the Motion Picture"" stands as a pinnacle in the annals of music for a science fiction epic. The composer's contribution to the latest installment in the long-running saga is a worthy addition to an already brilliant string of monumental scores.This disc offers the listener to fully appreciate the powerful themes that were overshadowed somewhat in the theater experience. A more militaristic score than his previous scores, ""Nemesis"" bombards and thrills the senses, befitting the confrontation between the valiant Enterprise crew and its latest enemy.The quality of SACD is definitely worth the extra expense and, like Trek, is a preview of things to come.For that, audiophiles can be most appreciative."
5,"Epic Soundtrack, Classic Goldsmith","The Nemesis soundtrack, is without a doubt, the greatest soundtrack in star trek history (Besides Star Trek: The Motion Picture) The action music is great, as heard in ""The Scorpion"", and ""Engage"" and many others...ALthough it is not the greatest album in star trek history, it comes in on #2 on my list, with The Motion Picture being first. The theme in ""My Right Arm"" is touching, and the track, ""Remus"" made my skin crawl. If you like star trek soundtracks, this is the one for you, I recommend an immediate buy!"
3,My opinion,"I found it easy to install and setup.I just needed to figure out how to reset each trip information, and I did it! First show the same information on screen 1 and 3, then push and hold button 1 and 2 for some seconds.Update: Passed away!The humidity kill it! Not a very good sealing."
3,Vetta Bicycle Computer,"Fairly good computer overall. Setup is tricky. Make sure you follow the instructions very carefully. To reset the maintenance timer, you need to go through the whole setup routine each time. Would not recommend to a friend."
1,don't get it wet,"I already didn't like this unit. The semi-english instructions sounded like they might be helpful if you already knew what they were trying to tell you. The lapping features were hard to use and didn't tell me what I wanted to know (as in, how long did that last lap take?). And I had to have the sending unit replaced (thank goodness for the friendship of The Bike Shop). So I was grudgingly getting along with the thing until I rode with it in the rain. Corroded the contacts, and when I made headway getting those back, the buttons failed. Yep, this was my first bike puter. I guess I expected too much of it."
2,"Confusing jumble of intersting, nature-related ancedotes","The book is a confusing jumble of interesting, nature-related anecdotes, weakly held together by the fact that everything is geographically located in the Andes. The thesis of the book is very difficult to discern, and worries the reader that there might not actually be one. I could not give it one star as the anecdotes are interesting, but one puts down the book with only a vague and curious understanding of nature and culture in the Andes. It does not help that writing style is complex and not very readable. Sorry for such a negative review."
5,Absolutely Adorable,"I bought this as a present for my friend's daughter, and both her and her mother adore it! I know what I'll be buying when I have to buy other presents for children. Good price for a well made item."
2,Not a strong treatment of the subject,"Like other volumes in the Eyewitness Books series, Car is full of beautiful photographs and countless interesting tidbits. Initial topics, focusing on both the old-time automobiles as well as how they fit into society, were quite interesting. However, the portions on the innards of the car became technical and rather boring. It reads like a poorly-translated repair manual at times. My wife and I both felt that it should have stayed with the cultural aspects of automobiles--for example, what has its role been in non-European and non-American societies? Also, a stunning omission is the lack of information on future designs and current experimentation. Not recommended except on a cursory basis."
2,Not a bad movie just not my style,The video quality is good and the sound is nice as well just wish there had been longer fight scenes. The appeal of the martial arts movie to me is the art of the fight and I enjoy seeing all the fancy moves and back and forth combat this is not that movie.
3,"5 stars for movie, 3 stars for release","OK if you have never seen this movie and are interested in classic kung-fu movies, by all means get this release, the quality is great. My complaint is that the Weinstein company lied about the special features. I already owned a great region 3 copy of this film, and was surprised to see that the new American release had commentary by Quentin Tarantino, which is stated on the package. I know that he is a big Shaw bros fan and was interested in hearing his insight on the film. I could care less about the film scholars opinions as they don't really state anything a fan wouldn't already know. Well the DVD does NOT have commentary by him, and my purchase was completely pointless. This review is to mainly to warn others out-there like myself who are huge fans that might also be considering purchasing this version for that reason."
4,tung tung,"I love pop & dance music very much, this cd does perfectly match my needs, I can't stop dancing when I'm listening to these songs. Just let yourself to have one immediately."
3,Brush heads,"I enjoyed getting the very hard to find extras but really I only needed the set of two POWER TIP brushes. Being able to get just those in a set of two or three,would be perfect. I'm paying for all three mouth care essentials and I don't use them. Thank you for letting me comment.Sincerely Patricia M. Butcher"
1,No happy with this mask at all.,"I bought this mask because it was highly rated. However this mask was a great disappointment. I'll start with my biggest problem with the mask, virtually all the vents on the mask was cover by plastic excess. I guess it came out of the mold and they attached it to the mask without bothering to free or cut an opening for the vents. I spent over an hour trying to cut out all that excess which I would've figured JT should have done.Also its small and does not cover, depending on big your head is, the top part of your head. I don't have the biggest face in the world but this mask stops right above my forehead, leaving the rest expose. Also the mask stops before my jaw line leaving part of my face and all of my neck exposed. Not cool.It's lighter than my previous mask but thats about it, I might actually just go back to my old one.Not recommended"
5,Excellent historical perspective,"Because the murdered victims were my husband's grandfather and great grandfather, I am familiar with this tragedy. Beatriz de la Garza reports this stunning injustice accurately and meaningfully. I recommend it highly to anyone interested in understanding the history of Mexicans and Mexican Americans in Texas. Judith Zaffirini, Texas State Senator"
5,"Yes, I Believe God can be glorified in a blues hymn project as much as in a traditional one.","This album is best put in the genre of acoustic blues, though you could also call it folk. Regardless, this is a collection of hymns, done in a style of music that is not traditional. So? The words are the same, and if God is glorified by these songs with piano and organ or an orchestra, why wouldn't He be just as glorified by a soulful vocal with guitar accompaniment and a slightly different musical style?This is a great album, and I recommend it. The melody of ""Surely Goodness And Mercy"" differs from what I'm used to, but the words are great, and the music is both modern and worshipful at the same time."
5,Best Vocal Hymn CD ever,I absolutly love this Womans voice and her band. I feel they have the best modern arrangements of Classic Hymns I have ever heard. This is a must have CD for anyone who enjoys Classic Hymns set to Modern music.
1,"Clogged, won't work","I use this just occasionally. Didn't use it for a long time, and it seems that the glue has become stuck inside. It heats up, but apparently the melt chamber is not long enough, so that there is no way to force out the old glue, even when set on high power. I think that's a poor design."
1,If you are retired.,This glue gun doesn't have enough heating power to melt the glue sticks. I had to wait 10 minutes before I got anything to come out and it felt like the trigger was going to break since it was weak and I had to put so much pressure on it to finally get anything out. Returned.
4,A real work horse!,"This glue gun has aided in the assembly of countless school projects, toy repairs, and household duties. Using the trigger, it is easy to control how much glue is emitted. It would rate 5 stars except my granddaughter's dog pulled it off the counter, breaking the stand. We had been babying the stand for awhile, as it is the weak spot in the design of this glue gun. Not only is it vulnerable at the site of the hinge, but the plastic the stand is made from seems to be more flimsy than the body of the gun itself. However, the glue gun itself wasn't damaged by the fall. Even better, it didn't leak hot glue when it fell. Although it is less convenient without its stand, we continue to use it, and have had no problems with leaks or clogs."
1,a real disappointment,"I bought this glue gun hoping that I would be able to use it for craft projects. But It simply doesn't work. The gun heats, but the trigger doesn't move the glue stick forward. It was a real waste of money."
4,Excellent introduction to poetry of Hughes,"This book features poetry of Hughes for children. The poetry carefully uses language geared for children, uses repetition more than images. This results in text that conveys to children as much the careful, artful use of language as ""fine poetry"". The illustrations by Bryan are a superb counterpoint to the text - again geared intentional towards children - but showing excellent use of color and a realism appealing to adults.This book succeeds in being truly for children without being sacchrine or insulting. Don't think of this as an ""ethnic"" book, it is far too good to be marginalized."
4,CAPHELON COOKWARE NEED A CLEANER TO REMOVE ITEMS THAT STICK,I HAVE MANY CAPHELON POTS.I FIND THAT FOOD WHILE COOKING STICKS TO THE BOTTOMOF THE PANS/POTS. I WANT TO KNOW THE NAME OF SOMETHING TOTO CLEAN THESE POTS. PLEASE GIVE ME A GOOD CLEANER.NORMA WENDEROTH
3,Erotica?,"I wouldn't really consider this erotica, but it has it's ""ups"" (if ya know what I mean). Now to be serious... this book is pretty good. It's kinda confusing how the authors sentences run on for long periods of time, but you'll mostly understand it. During some parts of the story, during one of the ""naughty"" seens, the author would begin to ramble on about something else once in a while, and then I think ""Oh no... don't talk about that... get back to getting groovy"". Ok, good and bad reasons why I rated the book 3 stars : Good language, run-on sentences, great depressing ending, well defined characters (or at least Lila), short story. One warning though, not only is it 128 pages, it can fit in my pocket. I finished the book in a few hours. But it's a great short read."
2,Disappointing and disjointed,"If you remove the romantic speculation surrounding the origins of this book, there's little else to it."
5,unbelievable!,"In my opinion, there is nothing more powereful than a book that makes you want to reach inside and touch the characters. Throughout this book, I wanted to do just that. The stream-of-conciousness style pulled me into Chimo's mind and wouldn't let me out; I saw the ghettos as he saw them, and I saw Lila as he saw her. I understood what he understood because his language made me feel it, and it devistated me. It's very seldom that I read a book and have to take a few moments after finishing it to gather up the pieces and put myself back together. Jane Eyre, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, and Jude the Obscure are just a few of these works; and the fact that the slim little volume ""Lila Says"" can do just as much to me as those classics speaks volumes."
5,Excellent Small Group Study,"This study guide is an excellent bible study for groups or individuals looking to develop their relationship with God. John Ortberg is very insightful, challenges your status quo, provides excellent examples of God's message and makes it relevant for you in your walk with Christ. He reveals God's desire to develop a relationship with you and challenges you to reach out to Him. I have struggled trying to find good biblically-based studies that balance God's Wrod with real-life relevance of His message. This study does that. I highly recommend it."
3,Review,I don't recall being told it was thoroughly written in but I guess used is used and I should be more careful buying used books online.
3,God is Closer Than You Think --Participants guide,This is an excelant program and the guide is very good if you attend the class.
2,Nothing but fun reading,"This book is okay for fun reading. The observations offered by the author are slightly entertaining, and may be even quite insightful to the very easily-impressed and motivated readers. For example, using conductor and resistor as analogy is misrepresenting the physics and meaning of the scientific terms. The counterpart of conductor is insulator. Actually a resistor in an electrical circuit is the part that does all the work - that makes the light bulbs or pickle glow, for instance.Using surfing as an example of overcoming failure is okay. However sidetracking to muse about sharks and dolphins is juvenile and distracting.I suppose this book is targeted for the average person and below for marketing purpose"
4,"insightful, touching, accurate, written from the heart","An easy to read book that captures the integrity of a military officer whose last tour of duty was to serve his country as a peacekeeper. He never made it home. The book, written by his wife, details the frustrations, the red tape and the longings of the heart, all of which become intertwined in her efforts to bring him home. Beautifully written."
4,"Good movie, bad military portrayal","I really liked this movie for its historical accuracy, however, the portrayal of the military as conniving and deceptive is totally inaccurate. It's well known that Kevin Costner is somewhat anti-military and he definitely made the chiefs of staff look like they were trying to start a war. That's not it at all. If you look beyond that, though, I highly recommend it for any history buff."
3,"Good, Not Great","Thirteen Days chronicles two weeks of incredible tension in the White House regarding the Cuban missile crisis. As someone who knew only the basics of the incident I found this movie to very interesting. Is it an action movie like the trailers try to show? Nope. Is it incredibly entertaining, an edge-of-seat thriller? Nope. So don't get it if you're expecting that. The acting is pretty decent, the screenplay is interesting and keeps the tension going, and the cinematography is fairly standard. I don't know if this movie is worth buying but it is most definitely worth a rental, assuming you are interested in the historical aspects of it. The Infinifilm edition includes quite a few tasty extras, including profiles of the real people who are cited throughout the film."
1,Boring,"I saw this film in a history class I was taking and it definitely was not viewed for the sake of accuracy, more as a comparative piece to an actual historical documentary and I must say I found the documentary of still pictures & voice overs more entertaining. I struggled to stay awake during this drag of a movie."
3,Hollywood makes light of History,"This movie is an interesting take on the Cuban Missile Crisis, in that it covers the issue from Kenny O'Donnell's aspect as Political Advisor. Costner's portrayal of this aspect is nominal at best. It's an O.K. movie if you've never visited the subject matter, but for a much more compelling account try The Missiles of October. You'll be surprised at how much popcorn you go through!"
3,"Good, but for Costner","What must have been a tight little screenplay with enough tension and historical interest to hold an audience's attention for 100-odd minutes is here pointlessly dragged beyond two hours by a string of utterly redundant scenes involving Costner's character and his family. God only knows what this abortive and indulgent non-subplot was meant to demonstrate. The gratingly obvious fact that nuclear holocaust would mean the end of American home life? That politicians are ""real people"" too? That a film with Costner in it must always be unnecessarily long? Who knows ... But his return to high drama demonstrated one thing to me, and it's something I think we've all come to realize over the last 10 years - Hollywood is a much more entertaining place without him."
3,NOT historical,"while this is a very well-made and gripping movie. it is by no means historic. things are taken out of context and the cuban and soviet sides of the story are completely ignored. meanwhile, the u.s. is once again (as with most ""historic"" movies) portrayed as the protector of all humanity. among other facts that are ignored, there is not mention of the fact that the u.s. had 500 missiles pointed at the Soviet Union while the S.U. had 50. if you don't know the objective facts about this event don't watch this movie until you do, otherwise you will come out with a grossly skewed idea of what happened.otherwise, it is an engaging and well acted (for the most part) movie. it is enjoyable, but incredibly one sided."
2,"Great story, but poor performance by Costner","Only Kevin Costner could take away from the great story told.The story of John Kennedy during one of the most dangerous times in our history is overshadowed by another poor performance turned in by Kevin Costner, who took the story of a man (Kenny O'Donnell) who was an advisor to the President, and made him almost equal to the Kennedy Brothers.Costner needs to learn a few things,First off, if he cant talk in a proper Boston accent, to use his normal voice. Secondly, to not interject himself too much into a movie. He had O'Donnell as everything from Chief of staff to Jackie Kennedy's chief of staff, to advisor to AG Robert Kennedy.If you can get past Costner's bad performance, great story line."
2,An Attempt... Falls short of the mark,"Kevin Costner stars in this over-dramatitized account of the Cuban missle crises during the 60's. The film basically encompasses the experiences of America's top leaders in the tense few days in which the United States was nearly brought to the brink of war between themselves and the Soviet Union. The acting is so ""over-acted"" that you can hardly focus on the events of the film without laughing about the character's reactions to the situations. All the actors totally fake accents are mind bogglingly annoying as you actually try to come to grips with the film. Costner's is the worst! Please, why don't they allow them to speak in a normal voice, it would help drastically. Besides that, this film was ""okay"", nothing extraordinary, and not too far below par, but it was missing a critical element called ""interesting"" that usually makes a good movie."
1,Reply,"(...) I say if more tolerant critics said this was one of the year's best films, they tolerated one heck of a lot. (...) I bought it for historical perspective. However, I should've rented it."
1,Boring nonfiction,"I found this to be a very bad movie, something thats a rarity with me, but this one was bad. My friends liked it, but they're into that stuff. It was too long (147 mins.) and the limited action scenes were disappionting and too short. /i give this movie 1 1/2 stars. The main reason I didn't give it 0 was because it's a movie."
4,moviefan,"This is a very good movie that i think portrays the mess that the Kennedy administration was stuck in during the Cuban missile crisis. This movie has been frequently criticised for not being very historically accurate. I don't agree, the only example of this being historically inacurate I have ever heard was that they gave Kenny O'Donnel (Kevin Costner) an inflated role. But we don't know exactly how big a role O'Donnel had. We don't know what went on in private staff meetings, maybe he had as big a role as was portrayed, or maybe he didn't. We don't know, but what was accomplished by O'Donnel being portrayed as being so close to Kennedy on decision making was that it provided a great median for telling the story of the Cuban Missile crisis"
5,The Best in Five Years,"This movie is, without question, the best I've seen in the past five years. And I'm picky. The cast is exemplary. Okay, Costner mangles his accent (Let it go people.), but all in all he gave a great performance. Bruce Greenwood was outstanding as JFK. And the underrated Steven Culp--he was chillingly wonderful as Robert Kennedy. Absolutely breathtaking. If you are the type who needs to be spoonfed your movies with gratuitous explosions, hollow characterizations, and chintzy dialogue--watch Power Rangers. This is a film for history buffs, Kennedy buffs, or individuals who enjoy a beautiful, intellectual movie."
3,Was ok.,"I am a huge Costner fan, but this was not one of his better films. It was ok, but not something I would buy again."
1,"Should have been titled ""The Kenneth O'Donnel Story""","Keven Costner attempt to adopt a New England accent was a total distraction to the enjoyment of this movie. Costner was in virtualy every scene shot in this presentation and the Kennedy's were portrayed as merely incidental to Costner's ""O'Donnel"" character. If one is to beleive this attempt at telling a story to an actual historical happening then one must believe that Kenneth O'Donnel made all the momentous decisions affecting this crisis. The ""Cuban Missle Crisis"" was a sub-plot in this film, as evidenced by the total absence of V.P. Lyndon Johnson in this attempt at story telling. Save Your Money!"
2,"no better than your average ""TNT"" production","This was basically a ""movie of the week"". The only reason it received bigscreen treatment was because of Costner's involvement. While I'm on the subject of Costner, I must say that his performance was horrible. His Massachusetts accent was horrible. He sounded like Elmer Fudd. Judging by both this and his performance as Robin Hood, it is obvious that, as an actor, accents are not his strong suit.Dramatically, the film was a dud. Anyone with even a basic knowledge of history knew exactly how things would turn out."
2,Could Have Been A Great Movie,"Costner's phony Boston accent (one reviewer mistakenly called it Southern - but that's understandable, because at the start, I too thought it was supposed to be a Southern accent), the boom hanging overhead and the poor portrayals of JFK and RFK ruined what could have been an excellent movie. The black and white segments were pointless and contributed nothing to the film (except a concern that something was wrong with the color shift on the film). I lived through the the Cuban missle crises as a teenager, and it was much more riveting than this movie portrays. What a shame. I give it two stars only because of the accuracy of the portrayl of America in the early 60's."
5,"DTS, WOO-HOO!","This film is truly great, great acting, great plot and story and also is very relastic, i am preety glad is going to be on DTS, even, because of the airplane sequences, and the bombings, i a, sure glad that Warner tooked the decision to start giving their DVD's DTS,as far as i know the only ones have been ""Twister"" and ""Lost Souls"", so then Warner, continue to give DVD's a DTS track, please?!...."
4,13 days equals masterpiece.,This is a really great film who is a fan of Kevin Costner. I'm very pleased with his acting in this then other of his other box office slammers.
2,Three Words...,"""Kevin Costner's Accent.""While the movie was an insightful look into JFK's and RFK's agony that they went through by not engaging an all-out war on Cuba and Russia, I couldn't get over Costner's absolutely horrendous New England accent. I had trouble focusing on the story line whenever he was on screen, and even in parts when they showed him where he wasn't speaking, I couldn't help but think of how he was going to butcher his next line. Was the director too scared to tell Kevin just to speak normally? It would have been a fine performance by him otherwise. The movie rates 3 stars but I had to downgrade it to 2 just because of the ""unlistenability"" factor that Costner induces every time he opened his mouth."
1,Thirteen Days,When I bought this movie I did not know it was for a different region. It WILL NOT PLAY ON ANY OF MY DVD PLAYERS! I am very upset by this!
3,Interesting account,"How close we came to Nuclear War - that is pretty much the theme of this movie. Although I doubt any movie on this subject could recreate the gut wrenching fear that we who lived through those 13 days experienced, this movie comes close. The world watched and waited in horror as a President, still reeling from the Bay of Pigs debarcle now confronts another Cuban threat but this time has to shape up and find the form he lacked against Castro for a much bigger opponent - Kruschev and the USSR!My only criticism is that I was a little disappointed by some of the acting, the Trade Mark Massachusett accent of JFK comes and goes, although Bobby's accent seems to remain adhered to his tongue. But other than that, its a good account of those dreadful 13 days in October 1962."
4,History Yet Again Hits the Big Screen,"I have to say that if Kevin Costner just stars in a movie, and doesn't have a hand in directing it, then it usually turns out to be a good movie. Thirteen Days is not an exception. It's blend of history and pure entertainment is a mix that is hard to beat. And with stunning performances by all of the cast. It makes it hard to say one bad thing about it. The story is about the thirteen days of the Cuban Missle Crisis where the Russian government strategically set up missles sites in cuba to launch against the western civilization. Costner plays Kenny Odonnell, Chief Political Advisor to the President of the United States. Roger Donaldson' s movie moves quickly and really tells a great story. It is suspenseful, fun, and has a good amount of action. One not to miss at any cost."
5,Powerful film -- Amazing DVD,"""Thirteen Days"" is an intelligent and thought-provoking movie with relentless edge-of-your-seat suspense throughout. This fascinating drama takes you right into the oval office and the Pentagon during the Cuban Missile Crisis when only the courage and leadership of a handful of men kept the world from nuclear war. Expertly directed by Roger Donaldson, the film showcases some top-notch performances by Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp as JFK and RFK and by Kevin Costner as presidential advisor Kenny O'Donnell. If you missed ""Thirteen Days"" during its theatrical release, be sure to catch the DVD version which has layers and layers of extra features, historical data, ""making of"" information, and commentaries by both the film-makers and by the actual participants themselves. This amazing DVD should be in everyone's collection."
3,Thirteen Days,"Those who like stories about JFK will likely want this in their collection. It is not the greatest of movies, but it does relate a period of history that is important as most American citizens never knew just how close we were to nuclear war. Kevin Costner does a creditable acting job, but there are some lines that are humerous and scenes that are poignant. One scene that strikes me every time I view the movie is one where Robert and JFK are seen only as shadows. They are not the shadows of actors but actually the historical figures. This did not do well in the box office, but again it seems to be historical accurate. It is a good view."
2,"""Out of Region""","When I opened the movie and prepared to play it in my U.S. History class, the DVD player could not read the disc. The screen said somehting like ""Not made to be played in this region."" I had never seen that before. When I ersearched the problem, I discovered that some distributors embed digital codes that align with DVD readers designed to work in specific areas of the world. This copy of 13 Days waas not intended to be sold in the USA. Very disappointing."
3,Long and mostly booring...,This movie could have been soo much instead it is long drawn out and mostly booring! i'll give it 3 stars because it is a learning film but i will give it 5 yawns!!
2,Tired of the whitewash,"Historical accuracy? Read ""The Dark Side of Camelot"" (Seymor Hersh). Those missiles were there because Kennedy showed weakness in the Bay of Pigs incident. ""Operation Mongoose"" was the Kennedy brother's CIA-run operation for their obsession with assassinating Castro. Kruschev saw weakness and the need to defend his ally. Didn't see that discussed in this ""historically accurate"" movie.Kenny O'Donnell was not the devoted family man depicted here. He was a sleazebag.My problem with this film is that it is an inaccurate teaching of history. The producers may not claim to be 100% accurate, but so many young people - and others - believe it to be true if Hollywood says it is. The bottom line is that the Cuban Missile Crisis was Kennedy's fault. It was the Kennedy ego that got us into that situation. The whitewashing of ""Camelot"" needs to end.For drama, it was a good movie. But that's about all that can be said for it."
2,Whitewash at the Whitehouse.,"The actual Cuban Missile Crisis provoked 2 films, one (Dr. Strangelove), arguably the most daring, funny, and ferociously facetious satire ever made; the other (Fail Safe) a sober, thought-provoking thriller. Like this. Fail Safe flopped, because by treating the subject with due earnestness it made it seem not very scary, whereas Kubrick's laughter was noose-swingingly gallows. But at least Fail Safe retained its grim integrity - 13 Days, especially towards the end, needs increasing doses of uplift and religious sentiment. This is a comforting, nostalgic, macho film that sets its narrative in the present tense so we can forget the dubious legacy of its protagonists. What saves it is a haunting final image that seems to undermine the previous two and a half hours."
1,Laughibly Bad,"Kevin Costner's ""performance"" in this dreadful film should finally earn him the lack of noteriety he has so ham-handedly earned. I'm only upset that I couldn't give it less than 1 star. When Costner first began to speak, I thought he was making fun of people with Boston accents. Then he kept speaking that way and I realized ""He thinks he's *doing* a Boston accent"". Pathetic. Boring. Read a book about the Cuban Missle Crisis."
2,This Film Should Be Retitled 55 Days,"The phony Boston accents didn't bother me. Neither did the performances by Kevin Coster, Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp. What did bother me is that the filmmakers assume the viewer is familiar with the Cuban missile crisis, the newspaper headlines and the politics of the period. They also assume you know all of the key players. If you don't, you're in trouble. Falling somewhere in between, I found myself often outside the action. Sometimes, I had to replay scenes (that helped). At other times, I had no clue what was going on. Friends and family who also rented the film gave it thumbs down. They hated Costner. I thought he was o.k. He fit the part perfectly. But you could tell that he was acting."
1,Cringe,"If you want to learn about the Cuban Missile Crisis...go to the library -- it is more exciting, and you won't have to listen to some of the worst accents ever attempted. NO STARS!"
5,Great Show,Best show love everything about it. Just recently visited Hawaii and it makes watching even better. Nice to catch up with missed episodes.
3,general appeal,"some of the characters are well developed, but seems to be written more to appeal to a broad audience than to be an excellent story. it is a very american tv approach to story telling which most often falls short of it's potential."
1,Terrible,"The movie's occasionally interesting cinematography cannot make up for its unfocused and ridiculous story of Dracula's son. Such a premise could definitely have yielded a good movie, but it's doubtful to me that the filmmakers really tried to make the most of the idea. Overall, this is a poorly executed film that is so bad it might be better off getting the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment."
3,Don't expect a typical Dracula,"I bet you Bram Stoker is rolling in his grave. This vampire movie may put you to sleep, especially the main character. At times he is convincing, then he gets this crazed look in his eyes which makes you giggle. The storyline is surprising though, a new look at a Dracula tale. Don't expect to much, but, if you are a vampire fan and have nothing to do watch it...."
2,SMELLY!,"This movie is really stupid and made me fall asleep.Maybe you will like it,but trust me rent this title before making your final choice.I recommend it that you see Bela Lugosi,Gary Oldman(Bram Stoker's Dracula,R),Kaulis Kinski(Nosferatu,1979)and Christopher Lee(Hammer Film Company).Rated R for language,violence,adult content,and nudity."
3,"All right, but don't judge all Dracula's by *this* version!","Dracula barely appears in this movie that focuses more on his son and his sons reincarnated love than on anything else. Far-fetched, with intersting camara-work and mediocre acting, this movie is worth viewing until the end when it becomes absurd and painful. For devoted Dracula fans."
5,THIS TRILOGY ROCKS!!!,"Hi! I was so happy finding all these L.J. Smith fans on Amazon! Now I know I'm not alone. I love all her books, especially Dark Visions, and would love to talk about Night Worlds. Anyone who wants can e-mail me, but it's my brother's address, so it might take me a while to answer. Hope I hear from someone soon!"
5,The Best Yet!,"This book was so good! I am so glad i bought the collector's edition, with all the books together! i couldn't put it down! I read all like 700 pgs. in 2 days! You can't resist falling in love with Gabriel's dark personality! I definitely recommend this book to all other L.J. Smith fans out there! Or just all readers in general! It's a great book!"
2,I love to read.....But,"I personally love to read and when i picked up this book i thought hey this seems good, but as i read it was dragged out in some areas and in others there wasn't enough, what i also didn't like was the fact that Kaitlyn was so choseie she went from one to another and every other word i read was 'I was so scared'...'frightened'...'angry' those words were repeated throughout the book so many times i almost went crazy. Plus i just got bored of the book, i dropped it right in the middle, then picked up bout 5 or 6 months later. Here are my thoughts on this book, you decide if you want to buy it, i say if you do want to try it out and read it then borrow it from your local library."
4,Good book,"Met my expectations, good book. I love L.J. Smith, she's a great author. The characters were good and the end had a twist I wasn't expecting."
3,i didnt believe it,i was actually really surpride when i read this book because it was not what i expected i actually did not like it as much as night worl or the vampire diaries . it think it was because it did not have a great plot. at the start the book was very interesting and i couldnt wait until the next page but then in the second part it was boring and i just really got tired of them showing gabriel as the bad guy and rob being goldenn and nice truth was that gabriel had just a lot of problem the only thing i really liked was the ending it will surprise a lot of people
5,great book,I have read all the LJ Smith books I can get my hands on. This one is not a disappointment. Great stories that biuld on the previous story.
4,Well Written Young Adult Book,"Normally I don't read or care for young adult literature, but I purchased this on a whim. It was overall a nice read. The story was very well written and original. The love triangle (which ended the way I was hoping) was a nice touch. It didn't hook me so much that I couldn't put it down and walk away for a few days, but I still enjoyed it. Great character and plot development. Overall, a good read."
3,Dont know what to say..,"This book just didn't hook me like I thought it would. I was interested when I read about it but then actually reading it cut me off. 5 strangers living in a house, where they learn they have powers. A guy wanting to steal these powers...It was just ok."
2,Dark Visions,"I did not like this book. This was the worst L.J. Smith trilogy that I've read so far. The ending sucks and if you're thinking of buying anything from L.J. Smith do not get this book first. Compared to The Secret Circle or Night World, this book was pretty bad."
4,Very good book,"Enjoyed this book, so did a few members of my family. Its a good book and anyone interested in supernatural reads, this is for you."
5,SHE Knows How to Write a Series!,"I love the way L.J. Smith writes! Each book in this series actually gets more serious, more riveting, and better; overall greater to read. This is how a series ""should"" be written!"
4,*Night World* Warm-Up,"I thought that *Visions* is like a warm-up for *Night World*. It was really cool. I love Gabriel, of course, and how Kait chose ""dark"" over ""light"". I love *Night World* because the ""darker"" characters are depicted so well."
2,Dark Visions,"I should stop with the L.J. Smith books. I never seem to like them. This may be the worst I have read so far. It didn't have a solid character, plot or storyline in it. I was lost most of the time and never really felt the urge to continue reading. I did finish this one however and was simply bored by it. I do not recommend you read this book."
4,great ideas and tips for all,"Mr. Ashey seems to know what he's talking about. This book covers a wide range of topics centered around altering and adding detail to your models. Lots of techniques for begginers to advanced modelers with simple tips to create the effects you want. He sometimes uses tools that most of us don't have, and doesn't always explain their uses, (i.e. working w/ resin and superglue) but on the whole a Very informative book. I would suggest it for anyone who wants to get more out of their model than what comes in the box."
3,Hit and miss,"This book is good if you're the kind of modeler who wants to buy a lot of after-market accessories for your kits. Also, the author builds 1/32 scale aircraft almost exclusively. Smaller scales are completely ignored. Keeping these things in mind, the book will certainly be useful to persons who are doing this type of kit building. If you just want to do the best you can with what comes in the box, then buy a Paul Boyer book."
4,Disappointed,This book looks very good for someone building plastic model airplanes. It is worthless for a scratch builder of balsa models (which I am).
4,The Last Best Hope by Ed McBain.,Enjoyed this. It was a keep reading until finished story. It held my interest right to the end. The Last Best Hope was good to the last word. I have enjoyed the books by Ed McBain..
3,Intriguing plot but disappointing ending,"Well written and fast paced. I usually love these stories, but as exciting as the ending started off, the payoff was abrupt and unbelievable."
2,Disjointed story line.,"A wandering story line left me wondering who was alive, and if not, when had they died! It was hard to keep tract of the plot when it jumped from present to past and back over and over again. It wasn't a book I could read without putting it down. It had great characters locked into a disjointed story."
2,Heart not in it.,"I have read all of the Matthew Hope series, and have always enjoyed them thoroughly, until now. I found this book just drifted along, and neither the main character or the author really seemed to have their heart in it, so I'm not quite sure why they bothered. I did not find the plot interesting at all, and the writing style was disjointed and unfeeling. I was very disappointed. I hope the new 87th Precint book, which I have sitting in my 'to be read' pile is better than this."
2,Hope Hope Shapes Up,"I've read & enjoyed all the Matthew Hope books & many of the 87th Precinct ones, so looked forward to this conjunction of the two. Alas, I agree with those who found it disjointed; it didn't have the sharp focus of most of the others. Matthew himself seems dispirited & adrift, out of focus as well. Cheer up, Matthew: find a new love & get back into the action. I've just visited the Calusa region where you live & the weather was great, the women gorgeous. Regain that hope, Hope!"
2,Too disjointed,"I have read all of Mr. McBains 87th Precinct novels and have enjoyed them all. This was the first of his ""Matthew Hope"" series that I have tried and I was very disappointed. It was so disjointed that I kept wanting to put the book back on the shelf. It left way too many things unsettled and too many characters were ""just there"" for no good reason. Even adding Steve Carella couldn't help this one. I did like the ending, however. In fact it couldn't come soon enough."
3,"A little drawn out, but hey, it's a miniseries","I'll keep this review brief, unlike the film. I think I really would have enjoyed this as a television miniseries. As a DVD, it kind of just drags on. The plot was engaging, if a little predictable. The performances were good, if not stellar. The subplots were just a tad underdeveloped, and Nicole DeBoer's character seemed almost extraneous for such a talented actress. Do I recommend it? Yes, not a bad way to spend the weekend. Would I pass up something else to watch it? Probably not."
3,Just All Right,"It took me a while to get into this mini-series, and just when I thought it was going to be a ""keeper,"" we come to an ending that isn't worthy of the series. Too bad."
3,Passes the time on a rainy day,"At the heart of this mini-series is a good SF idea about whether knowledge of the future enables you to change it.There are good performances from Randy Quaid, a Kari Matchett, and Gage Golightly but the story depends on us caring whether Timothy Hutton makes it past the hour appointed for his death and Hutton doesn't build any empathy for his character. Partly this is poor writing and partly it is just lack of charisma.The series splits into days and each of the 5 is written by a different writer and it showed. This approach my help keep long running series fresh but it loses the continuity and consistency needed for a mini-series.The story also backs off the physics at the end, making the whole thing into more of a Disney Channel cop show than a good SF story. I expected a more competent job from a director with Michael Watkins' background.If you decide to watch this, then rent, don't buy"
2,ehhh whatever,this is a whatever movie i bought it cause it had good reviews but i just found it kind of boring i think it def needed a better cast
1,Outdated and nonrelevent humor,"This book is so outdated and the humor references so archaic that three ten year olds would not even laugh or ""get"" the jokes. I would have rated it a zero star but you didn't provide that option."
1,Absolutely Evil and Disgusting Film,"This film is not worth a ""1"" but that is the lowest rating available to give it. The two so-called ""good guys"" in the film both end up dead, one physically, the other spiritually. One of the so-called ""good guys"" ends up murdering two people, an innocent lesbian made and also the matron of the hacienda. After his partner rapes this innocent lesbian made who has had a breast removed because of cancer and she begs him to stop raping her and cries throughout, then the other partner shoots her in the head. The film's director succeeded in getting me to jump in shock when he shot her. I feel emotionally raped by this disgusting and horrible film. Please don't darken you emotional and spiritual life with this movie. I will never watch a film by this director again."
1,Don't waste your money on this,"The music itself might be good, but the sound quality is horrible. I suppose it's because of limited technology available in these old days, but the smothered sound really irritates me and ruins any enjoyment the music might bring.Oh, and one more thing. If I had known that this CD used copy controlling technology then I wouldn't have ordered it. It's not right that I am prevented from putting into my iPod the music I paid for fair and square!"
1,Not Very Good,It seems the authors of this book could not make up their minds if they were writing a reference book or a tutorial. This book fails as a tutorial by not spending enough time on basic subjects and is too disorganized to be an effective reference tool. There is a lot of information in there but good luck trying to find out how to do something specific.
5,Highly recommend,"Every wife should read this book! It is a quick short read! References to the Bible, verses, tips, stories, along with humor."
1,Disappointing,My difficulties with this book may be due to the high expectations I had before reading it. The material is interesting but provides nothing we haven't heard before. It is based primarily on opinion and personal experience that cannot be generalized to the unique situations of others.
4,Worth reading,I found this book to be very informative and I would recommend it to my family and friends. I think they would enjoy it as much as I did.
5,becoming your husband's true helper,"I bought this book because I enjoyed ""Made to Crave"" (about eating and spirituality)by this same author. I didn't think I needed this book, but since I liked readingLysa TerKeurst's other title, I thought why not? And this book was on sale.Having read it --- it it very well done. This book really helps you break out ofyour own ""wife view"" and think about things from a husband's perspective. Honestly,I hadn't done much of that before reading this book. I'm a wife.I think almost every married woman would benefit from reading through this book.It opens your eyes to different ways of seeing things. It is well-written and positive.Lauren HodgeApple Valley, CaliforniaI also really enjoyed this book:Becoming Your Husband's Best Friend: Secrets to Loving the Man You Married"
1,A Massive Disappointment,"There is nothing hot about this salsa. There is nothing gourmet about this salsa. It's not offensive unless you were expecting Hot and hot this is not. Aside from that, it's a middle of the road salsa. Nothing to write home about. At ten bucks a jar and ten more bucks in shipping, I feel a little on the ripped off side. If anyone is looking for a really good burn, take it from me, don't waste your time. A child could eat this salsa with no problem."
2,Sorry I bought it.,"I have heard 11 of the 16 tracks - it just doesn't do it, for me. I think the loud style and hitting you over the head with his jokes/humor is a turn-off. I prefer more subtle humor than this. I feel I wasted some money."
4,Gates Products are better than OEM,"I ordered this tensioner and installed it without problems. This is a exact fit, well engineered product. In fact all Gates products for your car are well worth the money in the long run."
4,Craig David is awesome,"This is a great DVD and it really showcases how talented Craig David is. The set was simple: Craig David and a guy on guitar in the beautiful environs of Costa Rica. The choice of acoustic tracks were very good.The only thing I will complain about are the mild interruptions of ""commercials"" or ""breaks."" Anyway, this DVD is a must buy for Craig David fans."
3,Acoustic Craig David,"I found this DVD quite suitable for the avid Craig David Fan, and very interesting for acoustic guitarists looking at how to spice up their RnB chord and strumming techniques as Craig's guitarist, Frazer is amazing. It's a pity craig doesn't know how to work with the audience when he's on camera, but he makes up for it when he sings.I've had a look at his recent project in Cuba and that looks very promising, the boy is growing up."
2,cute as a joke gift,This is a gag gift. You cant fit more then 1 tampon in it and then its difficult to zip closed. Very disappointing considering the cost.
5,I love it !!!!!!!,"This is such a cute little bag. It has a retro appeal to it, and is small and compact - not that noticeable. I store all my important stuff in it, including Advil and earrings. Even though its a tampon case, I use it all month long!"
5,From Singer to preacher....,Jeff and Amy DuVall are very talented singers. Amy plays the piano beautifully and Jeff is a very talented drummer. I am proud to call them my friends. Jeff went from singing the gospel to preaching the gospel. If you enjoy the DuVall's singing you should hear Jeff DuVall preach the gospel.Any time you can hear them singing or hear Jeff preach do it!
2,A beginner's dvd,"This dvd is idealy suited for the beginner, novice, dancer, to learn the basics as it repeats the steps over and over again. However it would make a good gift for a friend,as a starter to get them into dancing.It is not one I would recommend to the advanced dancer, as you would probably already know these basics."
3,I'm Content,"Not for beginners!! Hence the ""Series 2"" part of the title. There are 3 Combinations of moves. Each Combination has 3 stages. Excellent narration! Combinations are harder than the one before. I think all of the examples are repeated enough times. Each stage has sections for the leader, follower, and as a couple. A lot of combinations of moves are taught. One CAVEAT: I think it's International Style; not American. But I still enjoyed it. It's worth the discounted price I paid through Amazon."
4,Summer Sounds,"Great summer sound! The Ventures play several classic surf hits in cluding ""Pipeline"", ""Surf Ride"" and ""The Lonely Sea"". Just lie back in your lounge chair on your patio or on the beach, sip a cool drink and enjoy!! Well done by Sundazed!! Nice packaging too!"
4,skagen watch,"I like this watch, although it is much larger than it appears. It really is the size of a man's watch. The band is really nice, but when it got worn, I had a hard time finding one to work. I ended up buying another watch, due to being unable to find one that worked well."
1,Worthless games,"These games are terrible, save your money. Something I would have expected when computers were in their infancy. No strategy and pitiful graphics. Save your money."
2,"Some Good Info, but poorly put together.","Like many others, I was really excited when I found out the excellent 33 1/3 series was doing a book on Loveless. I have been a fan for years, and still count it high on my list of best albums of all time. There is some good info in this book, but the author comes across as relatively annoying in his presentation. The book is badly organized, even ending with a chapter about an unrelated band!In the book McGonigal even mentions that it had to be rewritten because MBV's Kevin Shields disagreed with the first version of it.If you love the album, you will think the book is OK. Just be ready to ignore the author occasionally."
3,For those interested in the folklore...,"I'd been waiting for this book to come out for years, and when it finally did, I was a bit disappointed. The facts are straight, but the presentation was poor. And while I enjoyed reading about the background of this great album, I can't help but think that the only reason I kept reading it was because I'm heavily obsessed by MBV.Overall, it's a poorly written book, and the layout is messy and scattered. It's a good purchase if your hungry for the knowledge, but otherwise it can be an annoying read."
2,buyer beware,"Several friends and I have had similiar conversations late at night listening to ""loveless.""The writer takes an infinately interesting album and makes it boring.MOst my bloody valentine fans know a good 75% of this stuff. I do admire the new interviews with Kevin and it is good that Bilinda was looked up."
1,Pointless!,"If you know and love the album, this book is aggressively irrelevant. If you've never heard Loveless and are curious about the hubbub, take the money you would have spent on it and get the music instead. I borrowed this and still feel cheated. I'll never get that hour back....."
4,Good book but....,"I thought this generally was a good book - the quotes from Shields were probably the highlight of it. It was also pretty cool how the author described in first person how he felt at one of their newer concerts. The thing I didn't like was how he tried to make it a fact that MBV use to suck. I personally think as well as many others, that they were awesome. I can say that their old work is not as good as Loveless but they were so young when they started and they were also just beginning their journey on separating themselves from all other types of bands - to become one of the greatest of all time."
2,Writing is amateurish at best,"This book of fan-boy gushings from McGonigal is fine for, say, a quick read on a flight, but if you're looking for any kind of serious insight or analysis, look elswhere--unfortunately it looks like the only other option is the priceyMy Bloody Valentine's Lovelessby David Fisher."
2,"Too much McGonigal, not enough MBV","I was extremely disappointed in this book. Like many other reviewers I had been waiting anxiously for its release and this makes the disappointment with the final product even more difficult to take.McGonigal places himself in this book far too often. He presents only the most loose of narratives about the band itself and writes in what I consider to be an extremely amateur manner. It seems as if the book was produced with very little journalistic rigor, frequently regurgitating items from a previous work on My Bloody Valentine which should be considered at best disputed rather than true facts."
5,I had hoped this would never come out...,"....since the ideal book about loveless would fall prey to overactive self-editing. However, this is well worth the wait and was a joy to read, especially since McGonigal kept a healthy distance from the subjects while still showing why the album is so important. In a word: Chinchillas."
5,Don't overlook this book,"I cannot begin to imagine or suggest the effect this book will have upon another reader nor to fully comprehend how it has affected me; I can only suggest that one dare to read this book and not pass up the experience gained in the of reading it. It is well written in the author's unique style and a book that is hard to put down, yet I found that I had to take my time as I read, for the stories cannot be rushed."
2,Missing chapters??,"Okay, the book I received had a serious printing problem. The first chapters were there, followed by the beginning of the book (again) and a repeat of the first chapters. The last chapters were there. I was basically missing the whole middle of the book. Wondering how I go about getting another copy. Anyone?"
5,Winterberry is Ideal as Collectible Holiday Dinnerware,"Pardon my laziness, I'm going to post the same review for all the Pfaltzgraff Winterberry pieces I bought recently, because the good points are applicable across the whole collection. This pattern has numerous things going for it: 1. Attractive - the pattern is simple, and you can fill in with plain red or green pottery to make a really special holiday table. 2. Affordable - particularly on sale, Winterberry is priced lower than other holiday dishes and serving pieces, though the quality is everything you would expect from Pfaltzgraff. 3. Classic - Pfaltzgraff markets and sells Winterberry both in sets and open stock. I've been collecting it for more than 20 years, and they seem to come out with at least a half dozen new pieces per year. Did I mention the great quality?! Seriously, you can't go wrong with Winterberry for your own holiday dinnerware collection OR for a special gift. Enjoy!"
4,Truly Jazz'd,"I first listened to ""Jamin' at Jan's"" shortly after it was released in January and was very pleased from the start. A new look at contemporary Jazz, with a new group of artists, all of them superb in their own right. All of the solo's whether it's the keyboards, guitars or horns demonstrate the talent of the people involved. While the different tracks can each hold there own, I found none of them to be overpowering and play the CD a lot when I am on my computer. Good tunes, and I highly recommend it."
2,Unsafe tractor,After reading the other reviews on this tractor I can't understand why the one that we purchased for our grandson is unsafe. The trailor will not stay hooked to the tractor. One of my grandsons friends hit his head when the trailor came unhooked and tipped over. Wonder if we got a defective products or what.
2,Bigelow Blueberry,I found the taste rather unpleasant. They should bring back Tasty Tangerine and get rid of this one.
2,Great ending,"This film has a great ending...just what the horror buff ordered...but it took so long to take off, I'm not sure many viewers could last until the end. If you like low-budget...but creative horror...this one's for you. It's not a film you'd want to see more than once...a good rental for a group of young fans. 2 1/2 stars!"
2,Nowhere Near His Best,"Real quick this album ain't much to talk about. Alot of the songs on here simply aren't good from the lyrics to the beats. The Pistol u wanna hear is albums like Ballaholic and Fed Material. Only tracks on this album that are decent are Westside Sowed Up, Ballin Ain't A Thang,and If I Should Die."
5,Right on the Money,"This book is right on the money. Almost all the songs transcriptions, if not all of them, sound exactly the same compared to the actual song. There are two songs, Megalomania, and Feeling Good, that only have the piano parts. But other than that, the book is great and is definitely worth it."
5,HOTHOTHOTHOTHOTHOTHOT,"This hot sauce is no joke. I've loved spicy food since before I could walk, and can't remember ever eating anything half as potent as this sauce. I put a couple of drops of this stuff in nearly everything I eat, not only is it incredibly hot, but it has a really nice flavor to it as well. Just be careful, like the label warns, you can clean oil stains on your driveway w/ this stuff."
4,An easy presentation to not so easy concepts!,"This book presents some fundamentals of CFD based on straightforward mathematical tools giving fast access to very interesting general behaviours of PDE families. Apart from the introduction of basic concepts, finite differences and finite volume discretizations, the heart of the book lies in chapters 4,6,7 where a clear and systematic methodology to go from PDE to ODE to O(delta)E is presented. The classical stabilities associated to the most famous time steppings are presented. Some other features such as multigrid, splitting, and upwind dissipations are presented in the same clear setting. The book is very well written, clear and straightforward. I hope more advanced topics will be also included in further editions!"
5,Amazingly good,I have tried this product and absolutely love it. Almost tastes like mom's dutch apple pie. Definitely recommend this jam!!
4,Newlyweds in a Canoe,"Constance Helmericks and her new husband, both twenty-three years old in 1941, went into their marriage and the world seeking adventure. This turned out to mean setting out to live in the Territory of Alaska, though neither had a job waiting and the only person they knew was Constance's eccentric Uncle Fred whom she hadn't contacted for years.Uncle Fred proved to be friendly and helpful, and after a couple of seasons the pair were ready for their real goal: floating down the Yukon from Fairbanks to Seward in their own homemade canoe, living off the land. The old Arctic hands-- but never her husband-- insisted that no lady could manage the trip. In fact, Constance was the canoe expert who sat in the back steering while her husband sat up front providing power.The couple wrote three sequels about their Alaskan life, but they are from the husband's point of view: interesting but without the charm of Constance's tale."
3,Shabby book; good read,"The story, written in the forties, was a good read for anyone interested in ""old"" Alaska travel. But the book, provided by a used book seller through Amazon, was in shabby condition. Rated ""good condition"" by the seller, this old library book had a torn binding and could only be described as ""well used."" Since it was for a gift the condtion was a disappointment."
4,Special Classic,"Of high quality reproductions, a nice-published book posses a significant place in a public library collection of modern art/photography.It seems, this publication presents even more nudity and explicit s&m; works than a classic albumMapplethorpe."
3,Disappointing,"Being a huge Disney fan and Home on the Range Fan, I was very excited to see a making of book for the film. However unlike the glorious art of books of the past such as the wonderful Art of Pocahontas and Art of The Hunchback of Notre Dame which are literally dripping with concept art and drawings, this is nowhere near the same league. There is very little in the way of making of material and it is very kiddyish, with the book being narrated by Maggie the Cow. Still at least this film got a book unlike the Emperor's new Groove!For an adult animation fan this is dissappointing, but any younger fans of Disney / Home on the Range will probably love it!"
5,It's a Good Book,"This happens to be one of my favorite artbooks of one of my favorite Disney films. It has everything anyone needs to know about the making of the film and what qualities they used. What more do you want?The book has the reader feeling like they're being taken on a tour hosted by Maggie the Cow. It's as if she really is talking to the reader and knows what we're thinking. That's what made it so exciting. I love how the book shows art details made by Mary Blair(original Disney artist) and how they made a list of all the Disney classics from Walt's Era. This is another typical refreshingly Disney film as good as those listed inside; maybe not the best in the world, but still wonderful enough for any Classic Disney fan.I recommend this book for anyone who loves to collect any artbook based on Disney's films."
4,Big bang for the buck,"The sound quality is remarkably good for the price, especially if you're using them primarily to watch movies, when the 'Surround Sound' gives the music and FX a lot more presence.Pros (5 stars)- Price- Sound quality when 'surround' is switched on [phones still work when it's off]- Volume control [also works when 'surround' is off]- Over-the-ear cups help shut out any ambient room noise- Extra long cord [16.4 ft]Cons (1 star)- Surround sound requires 1 AAA battery [phones still work without one, and with 'surround' off, but the sound is pretty thin by comparison]- Slightly heavier than others we tried, but still reasonably light [10.6 oz]- Head band a bit tight at first, but loosens up with use"
5,History of the J.G.Brill Company,"A superb book. Very well researched and complete. More than just the story of a family and the successful business enterprise they built, it brings to life an earlier era. Debra Brill has a marvelous writing style and I hope she continues to write for our enjoyment. Much less dry and more enjoyable to read than most histories. Highly recommended."
4,The Immediate Work on WWI,"The underlying historical significance of ""Under Fire"" comes from when it was written more than from the writing. First published serially in 1916, it was widely read in the trenches of WWI by both French and British troops, and the book took on an importance for the thousands trying to exist in those awful conditions. In addition, Barbusse was an insightful witness, and had spent 17 months in the war, and certainly had been under fire. Other famous books were written considerably later and inevitably have a different perspective because of it (not necessarily inferior, but certainly different).Personally, I find Barbusse to be a compelling and effective writer, although his analysis of the war is more a cry of rage than a consistent argument. Taken together with Jules Romain's Verdun it makes for a valuable portrait of the perspective of the ""poilu."""
5,The Original,"The original, influential book on world war 1, that was a model to the English writers, Graves and Blunden. His eye for human detail and their degrading environment is superb."
3,overated,"After reading this book I was surprised to see it had an equal rating with ""Storm of Steel"", I would not even put them in the same categorie. This book had very long dry spells that took away from the few interesting chapters. The last few chapters dealing with the battle and aftermath are the only reason I gave it three stars."
4,Must Read,"This is an excellent anti-war novel by a writer who fought in one. All should read this book, lest we forget the horrors of war.(In 2003, I searched all of Paris to find the 1917 translation of this book. I found it in Berkeley, California, at a used bookstore and got ripped off. Then I found it re-released by Penguin Classics in 2004. Both the 1917 translation and the 2004 are good.)"
5,War at its ugliest and most futile,"Under Fire is a fantastic war memoir. It is brutal, gentle, horrifying, and somehow sweet all at the same time. Scenes from this book stick in my memory like they were my own experiences. Brilliant work, second only to Ernst Junger's Storm of Steel, perhaps, in Great War literature."
4,Top-notch guide for leading & personal excellence,"Want to develope the courage within you? Read Staub's 7 Acts of Courage. The author explains the role each of the acts represents and describes specific actions readers can make to honor our deepest longings. Each chapter is followed up with summaries and exercises that reviel what is restricting our achievements or overall satisfaction with life. These follow-ups uncover self-defeating behaviors which deny us the opportunity to experience wholesome relationships and what is dearest to our heart and, gives specific exercises to strengthen internal resolve. Focus is on accountability and how thaught patterns affect eventual outcomes. A must read for anyone who wants to incorporate the profound influence of courage with any dream or cause or purpose or mission."
2,"Deadly Recruits, Just Deadly",Less-than-thrilling account of an agent (Terence Stamp) whose former life as an Oxford don stamps his world with chuntering inertia.
5,DDRMAX 2 7th Mix SOUNDTRACK ROCKS!,"All DDR soundtracks rule, but I just love this one. It has 109 tracks on it! The beat is totally great with genres like rap, hip-hop, house,& dance tracks, its the perfect DDR SOUNDTRACK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!(...)~DDR RULES!~"
4,music is great,I purchased this CD because I use DDR pads with my students as part of our PE program. They love the music when they use the pads so I wanted the same music as background for my classes when we don't use the pads. It has worked out just fine. The kids recognize the music and it keeps them motivated!
5,Easy to read and very Informative!,"The whole story of how Mr. Notovich came into contact with, translated, and published the story of Jesus' life as chronicled by a buddist scribe. Easy to read and understand. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the life of Jesus, especially so, if you would like to know what he was doing between age 13 and 29. Highly recommended!"
2,Interesting,"I bought this book because I was curious about the idea of Jesus studying in the East. The book is written in a lovely style. You can tell this was written during the Victorian age....very nice writing style. But I felt this was a good book, an interesting idea, but fiction. I feel like the author used his talent for writing, with an idea of Jesus traveling to the East, and mixed it with his own traveling experiences and the Biblical teachings of Jesus. I do not feel that Jesus ever studied in the East, but it is a good read. I would not take the writing of this book to be fact or true."
2,Uninspired and forgettable,"This was a speculative purchase due to the editorial references to Numan, Kraftwerk and Ultravox. I have everything that Numan has ever released and about 90% of Kraftwerk's and Ultravox's output too. I didn't hear a trace of anything resembling those artist's creativity (I mean how can you imitate Numan? ;-) I'd say this piece of work sounds most like what John Foxx has been doing for the last few years, but without as much daring or melody. When I listen to something new I like to hear something which makes me want to hear a key track or two again and again. For me there are no key tracks and the whole album blurs into a wash of below par synth-pop. I bought Automatic by I Satellite some time ago and thought I'd like this too. I didn't."
2,For His Eyes Only is disappointing,"For His Eyes Only wasn't what I expected. The only uniform I want to see is on the hero! I don't think most women can identify with a military heroine. I want sexy military heroes, not a heroine who looks and acts like one of the guys! Reese was an OK hero, though kind of slimey for the first half of the book. He brooded too much and treated the heroine badly. The love scenes are hot, but the term purple prose comes to mind, and the setting was kind of drab and boring. Even though the ""romance"" seemed forced and wasn't believable, I liked most of the secondary characters. FOr the most part, the writing is good and I expect Candice Irvin's next book to be better than this one."
5,Rachmaninov: Piano Concertos 1 & 4 (Original Versions),Rachmaninov: Piano Concertos 1 & 4 (Original Versions) is a 2001 Ondine Inc recording starring pianist Alexander Ghindin. Vladimir Ashkenazy leads the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra. Here we get to hear Piano Conerto No.1 and Piano Concerto No.4 both in original version. Piano Concerto No.4 is a world premiere recording. Elger Niels has written the music notes. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.
4,Bathroom Reading for The Literati,"This pleasant little book is perhaps best described as bathroom reading for the literati. When your copy of The New Yorker isn't at hand, this is just the ticket for little 5 or 10 minute snippets of reading. Benard has done pleasing spadework in excavating the origins of about 75 famous literary characters: sometimes it's just the name, sometimes the look of a character, and sometimes their entire personality. The entries make for light fluffy reading, broken up by quotes from famous writers on the creation and nature of characters, cutesy line art, and sidebars like ""Characters with One Name"" or ""Some Orphaned Characters."" My favorite entry were the ones on Dantes from the Count of Monte Cristo, and my favorite rechristening was that of Bingo Bolger-Baggins to Bilbo Baggins. All in all, this is a nice little book to give as a gift, or to place in a guest bathroom."
4,Rachelle does it again.,I can not step away from this album. It is a must have for anyone who appreciates a great voice.
4,Sweet Little Item,"This is a really cute wind up toy and we've had one of the versions for two years now. There is a turntable in the center of the diorama and children on skates revolve around a snowman(or tree or other object) in the Center as an animated Winter scene. Music plays in the background during the revolutions.It made it through the first year but eventually the snowman in the center mysteriously disappeared. The rest of the pieces are still there and it still rotates/makes music.In all, it is a cute little stocking stuffer and the kids seem to like it - though I would not buy it if there are little kids in the house. The pieces inside do break off easily and could easily be ingested by an infant or animal."
2,Quaint Musical Gift,"For a stocking stuffer @ $7.99 this is fine. I'm glad s&h was covered by PRIME. It doesn't look like it will fall apart, perfect for a nic nak shelf and a gift under $10.00.I'm happy with it, so is the person I gave it too. The sound is very quiet."
3,Padre PIo,"This book is about the great Saint Padre Pio and is enfolded in a traditional Roman Catholic outlook.If one accepts that,then the book has great value. The author is undoubtedly sincere and a very holy Catholic woman,I would maintain though that this saint also has appeal to those who are not Catholics and have no intention of becoming Catholic. Further, that Padre Pio himself did not expect all his devotees to follow the path of conservative Catholic orthodoxy for their salvation.At the same time, for all devotees of Padre Pio, this short book is full of interesting details of miracles and how the great saint operated and so, is therefore worth reading."
2,to short,"To short no description of the item. If you feel like laying on yer belly or sittig in the dirt, get them mine went right in the fire place. Two sticks with a piece of bike inertube."
5,Great music for children of all ages!,"This is one of the best children's cds out there. I have given this CD to many of my family and friends and ALL of them have said how great it is. Some say they play it when their baby won't go to sleep. Others say, it's the best cd because, unlike other children's tunes, they (the adults) find themselves singing along and never get tired of the songs. It's got old fashioned nursery rhymes and lullabies and also original material that is just wonderful. The flow of the songs are great, too. The songs start off jazzy and fun then fade into soft, soothing lullabies. Perfect for getting ready for bed-time.A real grandmother sings along with a few ""grandkids"" and it all sounds just as good as if done by professional singers, maybe even better. Get this cd, now!"
1,Beware this Product,"This is being advertised as a CD, whereas really it is a CDR of dubious origin. There is no record company or manufacturer listed on the CD, ""liner notes"", or back paper.There are no real ""liner notes"" to speak of, only a foldout with a low resolution copy of the cover. The sound quality of the CDR sounds like, if I may venture a guess, it was made from mp3's derived from a needle drop. Additionally there is enough digital skipping to make it virtually unplayable.What a deal !!!!PS: I would rate this at Zero stars if possible, except that Amazon requires one star minimum."
1,"1 hr and 28 minutes of your life you'll desperately want back, guaranteed!!!","My name is Violet, and I was born into a movie you may not understand.If you have any hint of masochistic tenancies that might lead you to want to watch this movie try shoving a pineapple into your urethra and savor that sensation for a while.It will be only slightly less painful, and far more rewarding."
2,Not Good At All,I brought this movie at a 99 cent store because i confused it with Aeon Flux.Despite all the blood gore and killing i found this movie to be very boring.
2,This is the only version I have seen,The graphics of course are really great the movie was boring. I agree with the review that said wait and buy it in the bargain bin if you want the cool graphics but the movie wasn't that good.
1,A truly horrible attempt at a movie,"This is just a wretched, unwatchable movie. I would give it zero stars, but the Amazon system doesn't go that low. You could say the acting is lousy, except I'm not sure you can even call it acting. The special effects were smoother but ofherwise less interesting than Super Mario. I watched about a third of the movie and had to stop, the pain of viewing this trash was just unbearable. I've seen Mila in other movies that were pretty fun to watch, so I have to place the blame on the director here."
4,Ultraviolet is ultra-light on the plot,"The similarities between Ultraviolet and Underworld were similar in some respects. In that a virus changes the human species into something else. With Ultraviolet we have humans and vampires. A futuristic world with plenty of cool gadgets. The special effects in this film are the film, but the plot is really lacking. I felt somewhat empty after watching this film. With more work on the plot of the film in a potential sequel added to the intense special effects this could be a great film. You can tell the actors worked hard on their training, especially in terms of martial arts. The last battle scene is my favorite part of the film. The background music gives an ""old world"" feel in a futuristic world. All these fancy weapons eventually leads to swords. So elegant, so simple, the sword is a timeless weapon that appears to outshine the majority of the weapons created before and henceforth.Work on the plot and you have a great film. I hope there's a sequel."
2,Could have been so much more,This movie is a disappointment. Never fully explains itself or the universe it is set in leaving the viewer wondering what the hell the movie is about for the very beginning. The actions scenes look good but again you are never really understand the context or why they are happening besides chasing down the heroine in the story. The movie introduces plot points and characters and then never finishes the plot or explains who a character is. The look of the movie is good but the script and plot are terrible.
1,A Waste of Time,"Imagine Kill Bill and the Matrix blended together and made by people clinically free from any trace of talent. Actually, you don't have to imagine it - here it is!"
1,This could be your fate if you don't live right,Think of an eternity of burning torture. That's what watching this mess of a movie is.
3,OK,"I liked but didn't love this movie. I thought it got kind of boring in areas and although I know its the style, the softness of the cinematography bothered me. I bought it because I like Milla Jovovich. As far as the movie itself goes, buy this one from the bargain aisle and not at full price."
1,No point,"The TV previews were the best parts of the movie. Other than that, it was a total waste of time to watch. The story was completely off the wall stupid. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. I have only seen it once and I don't plan to watch it ever again."
3,ultra???,"I thought the movie ok. I didn't know anything about the character(s) before watching the movie, so my expectations weren't that high. The action was fast paced, lots of interesting gadgets, and explosions. The fight scenes were good too. The story itself lost me at times, it didn't hold my attention."
4,"Ultraviolet (Unrated, Extended Cut)","Great Action but no kind of Story. If you like no stop Action with no great Story you will like this Movie.Special Effects were not so good, the real fights are much better.Funny Style and alot of funny words...And a great Milla Jovovich in sexy Outfit."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I found this movie to be boring and found myself hoping it would be over soon. I am not a real big sci fi fan, but my husband, who is a HUGE sci fi fan, was pretty disappointed in the movie. It just did not hold my interest."
1,Makes 'Resident Evil' Look Like High Art,"Admit it. Milla Jovovich with purple hair is hot. You're right, she is. Well, you're not alone because that seemed to be the only idea behind this production. Other than that, Ultraviolet is cold, stiff, shiny, cheap-looking, badly shot, and woodenly acted.Rent if you must!"
2,What a waste,"Sigh..... such a waste.The ONLY reason to watch this movie is for Milla Jovovich.The special effects were good, but effects cannot carry a movie... well at least not for me.But the story? Horrible.I've watched it twice, the second time because i had no clue as to what was going on the first time. And the second time was a complete and total waste as it was. I'm just glad i skipped this on the big screen."
1,blah,"pretty much terrible. Another movie just to keep the $ rollin in. I really don't see how anyone could like this movie. Unless you like Milla... Jst go download some pics of her, or watch the Fifth Element again."
2,stylish junk,milla is a female equivelent of orlando bloom.he has a thing for swash buckling and she has a thing for leather.neither one seems to get it right.you better hurry if you want to see this in a theater because its time is about up.
1,Definately NOT a Matrix on their Special effects!!!,"This movie is at best a ""B"" movie -- B as in I'd rather ""B"" watching anything else, but this! My kids actually asked if we could return this one, it was so bad. We stopped watching it mid-film due to the uninteresting aspects of this film. We stopped after the corny evil leader shooting 3 of the 4 trapped hemophages, one in the mouth, one in the eye, one in the ear -- the speak no evil, see no evil, hear no evil -- about it made us actually crack up laughing for about 3 minutes. Who knew it was actually a comedy?"
2,Just Didn't Do It For Me,"I'm into sci-fi, action, special effects, comic books, and future society depictions. This should have been right up my ally but it was just predictable and silly.If you are into the things I just listed then you might want to give it a go. Maybe you'll get something out of it I appearently could not. But I can see this film fitting the tastes of a very limited number of people."
2,If you value great Surround Sound..Stay Away,"I think I'm mostly going to touch base on the surround sound. It's not good, and for a film that boasts as much noise and action as ""Ultraviolet"" does, I was gravely dissapointed at what I got. I don't know how many DVD's is considered ""Alot"" but I have quite a few and the 5.1 Surround Sound on this film is very lackluster. If you want a good futuristic movie with real acting and intensity get Kurt Wimmer's first movie ""Equilibrium"". If you have already seen it and are still curious about ""Ultraviolet"" go ahead and see for yourself. It's almost the same concept (totalitarian future government) but even less realized then his other film. Milla Jovovich's acting chops are not even close to being in the same league as Christian Bale from ""Equilibrium"" and almost everything becomes tedious when you don't even have great sound pumping out of the speakers to fall back on. Watchable, but not worth your money.....too late for me...don't let it get you too."
4,good movie,i think that this movie could had more scences to it but it still was a good movie and lots of action in it. should be a part two i think.
2,Dumb Story,This is the most dumbest story I've ever seen. It does not make sense and waste of my time to watch it.
2,What In The...,I saw this movie last night it sucks so bad i should of known there were 3 people in the theater including me sad storyline awful fighting i feel asleep i think dont waste ur money on it
3,didnt like it...,"i never watched a movie so stupid like UV :Sthis had a few special effects, but it also had some horrible special effects, so let me tell you if you're a fan of good special effecs dont watch it!!see ya ;)"
1,There should be a negative star rating...,This was the worst movie I've seen so far in 2006. I really wanted to like this flick but I found myself using my cell phone half way through the film and nobody cared. Unless you are THAT much of a sci-fi junkie that a horrible plot and script means nothing to you or can justify a bad movie because it has some T&A then don't waste you money. I know 6th graders who could have written a better script thatn this.
1,Horrible Movie,"This movie looked like a good action Sci Fi movie. It was not. This movie has one of the worst scripts ever. The acting is just horrible and the plot is not fleshed out at all. Save your money do not buy this movie. Though the extended cut might add some more, I still believe that nothing can save this excuse of a movie. Equilibrium was a good movie made by the same director, so if you want the same style get that instead."
4,graphic novel come to life,"In reading the previous reviews and hearing other movie-goers comments, I'm surprised at people's expectations for this movie. The movie isn't deep, but it is very effective at what it's trying to accomplish - making a graphic novel come to life.It's stunning visually. The use of colors and other symbology make it very visually interesting. The special effects are very fun. It's what I expect from this genre.This is film candy - enjoy it for what it is!"
2,Trying to be some... thing,"A fairly entertaining movie, but pretty shallow when it comes to story. The action/fighting is very exaggregated and I think it fails to do whatever it tries to do. It comes out pretty stupid at times. 5/10."
1,"Anticipated, then disappointing","Loosely based (which means ripped off from) onUltraviolet, which is a truly wonderful BBC take on vampires but owing more toThe Spy Who Came in from the ColdthanBuffy The Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set (40 discs), and done by the same people who gave usEquilibrium, it coulda/shoulda been...well, FUN at least. Instead, the words ""Uncut"" and ""eXtended"" simply add insult to injury."
1,The Best Comedy to hit theatres in a long time.,"Now before we get into this I want you guys to know one thing: This movie is bad. I mean really bad. Catwoman bad. Its so bad that it's acutally funny! When I saw this movie with my friends we stopped trying to take the movie seriously after the ""Pin-ball Ninja's"" in the very begining. Afterwards it became the funniest thing I've scene in a long time. I'll never forget the Final Bad-guy's line right before they fought: ""You got your blood on me. It's on!"" That's right folks this guy said ""It's on"" in a movie trying to be serious. It doesnt help his case that he has nose plugs on the entire movie. The only thing I can saw was good about this movie was the special effects, nothing more. 1 star for good effects. Rent it and watch it with your friends if you want a good laugh."
1,Ultraviolet,"Violet (Jovovich) is a Hemophage, infected with a blood sickness. Hemophages are exiled from society and actively hunted down. With the disease though comes extraordinary agility, strength, and dexterity. Violet is the Hemophages' best hope to deal with Daxus (Chinlund), the military leader. Violet's job is to find the doomsday weapon he has created, and destroy it. The doomsday weapon is a child named Six (Bright), and when Violet is unable to kill him, her own people set out to find her too.""Ultraviolet"" is a bad movie. The acting is bad, the special effects are bad, the fight scenes are bad, the dialogue is bad, and even the story itself is less than stellar. These are too many stikes for the film to overcome and whet is left is a laughable mess. Sadly, the opening credits are the most engaging part of the film, and seem to hint at the promise of something good. Do not bother with this movie, even on DVD."
1,1 star is too generous,Before you attempt to watch this film you must first set your expectations as low as humanly possible. Done? Now set them lower & guess what? This movie still stinks. A film created for people who thought Aeon Flux was waaay to deep.
2,Lackluster film,"I've tried to watch Ultraviolet several times and failed (after being sent the product erroneously several times). Visually intriguing, the plot of this movie falls apart rapidly and the acting, while not horrific, has nothing to recommend it. It speaks to the movie, I suppose, that repeated attempts to give it away to friends has resulted in a very dusty copy still sitting on my bookshelf."
1,the suckiest suck to ever suck from sucksville,"basically, the only excuse i can think of for this movie's existence is that Mila Jovovovovshvjsoich loves to ""strike a pose"", because that's really all this is.well, i say ""all"", and i just watched the first 30 minutes.horrible.there hasn't been a good sci-fi film in so long."
2,Had lots of potential,"This movie had all kinds of creative sci-fi ideas in it, and ultimately, that is what caused the movie to fail. There was just so many competing ideas mishmashed into there together - this weird vampire dream, pocket dimensional technology, viruses, etc etc. If a more coherent/unified story had been wrought, this movie would have been a lot more."
5,Ultraviolet,"Ultraviolet is the ultimate science fiction/comic book hero. The action sequences outdo the skills and camera work of ""The Matrix"" and ""Kill Bill"" with Milla Jovovich giving her best performance to date. She is the ""Titan...the Monolith"" in an underground society fighting to save a young boy, and the people of earth from a heartless ruling class. The cinemaphotography is excellent as are the action shots. It's a classic science fiction/comic book action thriller that is easily watched over and over."
2,Ultraconfusing,"Violet is a hemophage - a woman who's been infected with a virus that has made her and a few others vampires.The society at large wants them all dead. They construct a weapon played by Cameron Bright. Cameron's just a kid, but with a deadly secret.Cameron's also a kid who has limited expressions - playing the same creepy emotionless type he played in ""Birth"" (against Nicole Kidman)This film's storyline is confused but plays out much the same as (the more entertaining) Aeon Flux - futuristic society run by oppressive oligarchy; female warrior able to kill thousands through trick cartwheels and fancy weapons.I still gave this two stars because the special effects are great."
2,zzz,"I've tried to watch this several times and fallen asleep every time. I don't know, I guess flashy, meaningless fight scenes are my lullaby or something. There's a lot of those, and some are pretty neat looking, but this movie is all flash and glam with nothing else going on. The plot is really basic, about people turned into vampires fighting for the right to survive, the twist at the end is silly, and the characters are all cardboard cutouts. The only thing it's got going are the special effects and fights, but they get so repetitive that, as I said, they put me to sleep. I'm not kidding about that. Right to sleep."
1,one of the worst movies ever,"I was looking forward watching this movie. I truly was...I'm totally into movies like Aeon Flux, Matrix and Equilibrium but this one sucks...sorry guys but I was really disappointed.It's a waste of time...and money. Especially the SFX scenes are poor...dialogues are confusing and it's a waste of such good actors like Milla Jovovich.Watching on your own risk.Tom"
1,Just a bad flick straight through,"I was surprised that I disliked this movie as much as I did. The previews actually looked pretty good. Milla has done some good action films (i.e. 5th Element) and thought this could be another one.I'd call it low quality at best. The CGI is blatant and in some scenes a disgrace. The actual sets they do use are used over and over again, you get a feeling the city is three blocks by three blocks.While the first fighting scenes were good, the same things just kept happening and happening. Great, she walked into the middle of a circle of enemies. Over and over and over.That isn't even the real detractor, the acting sucked! The enemy was awful, the kid was annoying, the tech sidekick was just scuzzy and distracting, and Milla couldn't act her way out of a bag in this one.I'd consider this more of a Spawn type action movie. Do not buy."
4,Milla always looks great!,"Great action and special effects. I really enjoyed the comic book, dream-like colors and graphics. And of course Milla always looks great in any movie."
1,Even my thirteen year old nephew found this idiotic...,"...and you know when a young man in full testosterone blow finds a film with a hottie like Milla in it to be an incomprehensible waste of time that it REALLY must be a stinker.Not even worth renting, we saw this upchuck as a first run at Austin's legendary Alamo Drafthouse and walked out wondering why we had bothered.I'd spare you that, if I could."
1,horrible,"really bad, I've wanted to see this for years for some stupid reason.Don't be tempted like me.waste of time."
1,1 star is too kind...,"What was Milla Jovovich thinking? This stinker almost ruined her career? This is just some Aeon Flux ripoff. I rented this, and gave up in the middle. Here's why:-The Plot.-The S/FX= HORRIBLE!-It's lame attempt at being a cyberpunk movie, but fails! You want a good cyberpunk movie, watch A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.-The martial arts. Gimme a f***ing break! THey look like they're drunk and tring to do the can-can whenever they kick.-The acting= HORRIBLE!.-The city looks horrible.You want a good sci-fi flick? Thet's why you have THE MATRIX."
1,"Good transfer, terrible movie","Good PQ and a solid transfer cannot save this movie. By far one of the worst movies on Blu ray, utter garbage. Terrible acting and some of the worst action I have ever seen in a action movie. Story is lacking and somewhat confusing. Blu ray can't save this films many flaws!"
4,actual high def transfer,"dumb movie, colors are a little dark.. have to keep adjusting the tv's color profile.. weak surround sound. Some issues with the color shading in some heavily manipulated scenes.All these things aside, it is a good transfer, in actual high def, and in a much better presentation.. 1.85:1, which fills the entire screen on my samsung high def dlp, compared to the more commong 2.40:1 which has black bars at the top and bottom."
1,Very...very...I mean very dissapointing,"I have never seen such a missuse of great sci fi effects. The stunts are crazy, the graphics oustanding, but the story is so lame, the action to predictable. She kills her enemies way to easy, there's no one to challenge her it does not make it interesting. Now why Milla wasn't chosen for BloodRayne? perharps the movie would have done great, after all Rayne is modeled after her, I think this movie is trying to show us that Milla can be a Bad ass vampire warrior, but somehow it reminds me of Aeon Flux gone bad. I am sorry but this movie is highly rental material is you want to have some good laugh, it can not be taken seriosly, don't get me wrong I love Milla as an action star but this was a major flop."
1,Bad acting and bad effects,I could plainly see that the action scenes were done in front of a green screen and I could tell exactly when there were 3D animations used. It was that bad. It definitely was not seemless. Milla Jovovich was probably the worst actor for the lead roll. She could not pull off that tough woman act. Her acting was over-exaggerated (badly) and it was trying too much to be the matrix and Aeon Flux. The acting was terrible by most of the actors and the actions scenes were so fake that it was unenjoyable. I am currently watching the scene where she is talking to the little boy as he stands on the rail. Wow! What horrible acting!
4,MMMMMMMMMilla!!!!,"Watch Milla ""Yovovitch"" kill about 5oo guys for an hour anda half.Good that they kept Milla in front of the camera for 90 minutes.Who cares about the plot.I bought Zoolander and Milla was only in it for 2 minutes. Bummer"
5,Well for me it's a good movie!,"First of all I have to say that I like every kind of movie and this one actually surprised me! I know it's not perfect but it's worth every cent, especially for Milla!Many movies are slammed by the audience and the critics, film such as Catwoman (which I liked very much, and I have it in my dvd collection!) or an Uwe Boll film (I only watched Alone in the dark, which was not that bad, and soon I'm going to watch Bloodrayne)...You should give this movie a try! I'm not telling you to buy but at least rent it! It's entertaining!"
2,Eye candy and nothing else,"The film is cinematically gorgeous but way too unbelievable to be enjoyable. If I wanted to imagine a dark near future scenario, I could have done way better than this.Ultraviolet is a film about a babe who is also a killing machine. She lives in a fantasy ""near-future"" world run by a technocratic pseudopriest and divided between humans and those infected with an unbelievable virus that has turned them into superstrong, superfast ""vampires.""I had a hard time not falling asleep because the entire premise of the movie is silly and the action is so over the top it bored me. The only thing that kept me awake and paying marginal attention is Milla Jovovich.The only reason I can see to watch the movie is if you're obssessed with her. I'm not, but she kept my attention on the screen - barely."
2,Hello. My name is Violet and I was born into a world you probably don't care about.,"Ultraviolet starts out decent, but with chase scene after chase scene it grows old quickly. I like the idea behind the story, but I didn't feel like it was utilized in ways that it could have been. I guess I will keep this short and simple. The movie had some pretty good fight sequences, Jovovich plays the part of a ""death dealer with a heart"" well, and the futuristic look of the film keeps you interested to a point, but the rest of the movie just seems cumbersome and drawn out. It reminds of Underworld meets Resident Evil in a way. Ultraviolet is ok for one viewing, so I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is into sci-fi and action to check out or if you are a fan of Milla Jovovich. So, with the exception of Milla and the couple action sequences I feel that this movie is disappointing and falls flat. That's just one man's opinion, so judge for yourself."
1,If I could give it negative stars I would,"After the movie was over, the 4 of us watching just wished for the hour and a half of our lives back. This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a very long time. No plot, no dialogue, no motivation really for anything, very confused, no interest in the characters, not great effects, too much notice of the fact that it was mostly animated backgrounds and people. It was TERRIBLE. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. We should have been warned when even the teenagers in the theater were walking out in the middle. They had better sense than we did!"
2,What is good!,The picture is nothing but a stylized fighting movie in the style of Hong Kong or China movies. No real story plot just plain action. If you are interested in action this movie is for you!
3,Lightweight Entertainment,"I heard a review of this film by a critic who had panned Aeon Flux. He said ""Ultraviolet"" made him yearn for that film. No, the film isn't THAT bad. It is fun, lightweight entertainment. Milla Jovovich has fun with this - her soliloquy at the end is charmingly hokey and designed to make us yearn for a sequel. I confess....I wouldn't mind seeing Violet pound the cream cheese out of some more bad guys.Fun for any fans of ""chop socky"" films."
3,Ultra-Midriff,"An Ultraviolet haiku review.Guns, swords and belliesAnd Milla's sexy bodyMindless popcorn fluff"
4,Very underrated,"Dazzling visual style, eye-popping special effects, wild imagination, thrilling martial arts, balletic violence, an absence of gratuitous sadism, and probably the most beautiful woman in the movies today add up to a feast for the eyes - a visual poem, a live comic book. This is the movie Sin City wished to be."
2,Go with DVD version,"My comments only concern the DVD versus Blu-ray issue.I have the unrated extended cut of the DVD version and the PG-13 theatrical cut of the Blu-ray version. My experience has been that DVDs mastered in high definition look identical to the Blu-ray version (either on a Blu-Ray player or an upconvert DVD player). Ultraviolet is no exception. Moreover, the look of the film seems to soften details, which really defeats the point of Blu-ray.Aside from no improvement in the look, the Blu-ray version has no more special features than the DVD, and the extended cut DVD has seven additional minutes. Go with the DVD version on this one."
2,Ultra who cares.,"Aeon Flux revisited. Yawn inducing plot...... It is so similar to aeon flux...heroine does mission but during mission the bad guys and good guys become unclear....blah. Fight scenes consisted of her twirling and dancing around while hundreds of bullets sprayed around her, never hitting her. She changed hair color for what reason? The annoying mute kid accompanied her through the movie, much like so many other annoying mute kids in movies (the new x-men, etc....) Not worth the time."
2,Visually stunning; storyline non-existent,"From the trailers, I thought the special effects of this film would be absolutely stunning and I was not disappointed in that respect. I suppose since it was so visually rich, the producers didn't feel the need to have a plausible, coherant story to go with the visuals.The lack of script leaves the actors with nothing to do when we aren't being dazzled by the vivid colors, futuristic weapons and vehicles. The fight scenes look like a John Woo acid trip.Jovovich has done much better in the acting department and certainly we have come to expect more from Fichtner, but we can't blame them for the material they were given to work with.So, if you watch this, go into it wanting pure eye candy and not to get any sort of story to go with the view. Otherwise you will be very disappointed."
3,Ultra-Decent,"If you want to know what ultraviolet is, think if Trinity from the Matrix had the personality of the bride form kill bill and stole the clothing of elektra and moved next door to aeon flux. This movie has alot of eye candy and action, with not a whole lot of plot. But really, its not like the studio wanted a oscar for this, this is just a summer blockbuster type movie, so everyone chill out. In all reality, its not that bad. its a fun movie with a ok cast and just ok acting but in the end, when it comes to movies like these, its all about the fun factor and let me tell you that movies like this have a higher fun factor than crash does."
3,A Movie I have been waiting to see!,"I think this movie is cool because of the action, CGI, and the artwork of the movie. Milla Jovovich is like one of the best new actors I have ever heard when she starred in the movie. I think what bothers me about the movie is that ever since it came out in theaters, there where no reviews I mean what was going on? Besides what I really wanted to say is that Ultraviolet is a movie I wanted to see in theaters since my Aunt passed since Feburary. I give this movie a 3 out of 5 stars."
1,Nothing here move along,It a waste of money to buy Ultraviolet. The story line is very poor written and the fighting sceens look fake and boring.
2,"Milla, Milla, you're so much better than this!","I like Milla Jovovich, I really do. But when I saw this movie I cringed at the bad acting and overly contrived fight scenes. The only things that made me sit through it were Milla, the music was kind of cool, and the wierd, super-saturated colors. Everything was very bright and bold, but the feel of the setting was very cold, sterile and austere. I liked that juxtaposition. But the fight scenes...please! She's surrounded by a circle of heavily armed and armoured guards, you hear one squishy slicing sound and they're all laying dead at her feet? ::facepalm:: Oh wait, of course, it's a movie! Too contrived and coincidental for me."
2,Milla kills everybody,"This film is about set action pieces and tight pants. Milla handles both very well. But the movie, average at best. The story is one that's been told before, but has potential if it was allowed to unfold, not thrust upon us to get to the next scene of Milla killing everyone. Special effects, not real special: Think Tron upgraded, but just a little. Overall, it's okay if you like Milla, Milla's stomach, Milla killing several hundred armed bad guys or Milla in tight pants."
2,un film surprenant,malgre de gros moyen le film montre une absence totale de scénario ce que je regrette vivement le realisateur ne s est interesser qu a l image et a la colorimetrie de son film qui malgre de bonne trouvailles peine a interesser le spectateur au fait cette edition ne possede pas de sous titre francais malgre ce qu il y a d ecris sur la jacket dommage pour moi
5,good film - bought it instead of renting it!,good film - bought it instead of renting it! That says something unto itsef. Shes HOT.
2,ultraviolet,I thought this movie was confusing. Im still not sure what really happened in this film. My boyfriend attempted to explain it to me but he failed. Were the people vampires or not? I was and still am lost about it!
1,Rip off,"Received only one disk. Loaded it in the computer DVD player. Activated the digital download. Never got asked for the code, but after approximately three minutes of appearing to download the file a message displayed that says the digital copy is expired. I tried to find the movie to play. There isn't one. Basically this is a rip off.Ultraviolet (+ Digital Copy)"
2,Ultraviolet,"Over abundance of fight scenes, many taken directly from the form and style introduced in ""Equilibrium""(a much better flick by the way). Unfortunately they got in the way of a potentially interesting plot. I liked Milla in 5th Element and the Resident Evils, disappointed with this one."
3,Mildly entertaining,"I felt that this movie relied too much on the CGI and the BS factor is extremely high but it was mildy entertaining and the time passed quickly. Milla is gorgeous, as she is in everything, but aside from one buttock shot and a bare middrif, there is no skin. At least with The Fifth Element we got a little nipple!"
3,Great ideas gone to waste.,"While i had a decent time watching this film, it didnt have that special something that kept me glued or made me want to watch it a second time.And while there was some great potential in the story and setting, it seemed like it was a wasted effort.First off, i think the director tried too hard to make the movie 'futuristic.' Every setting and prop looked straight from the Jetsons. Except for those unexplainable guns from our present time. Or those military trucks from 1995 or so.And why did Milla have to change color like a chameleon?There was no explanation or reason behind that. Anyways...Ultraviolet had some decent action scenes, although a bit repetitive, some bad acting, and a plot that took itself way too seriously. Add this all together and you have your average bland popcorn action flick. Ho hum..."
1,DEFINITELY NOT ONE OF THE BEST,"This movie sucks. Absolutely NO gore with battle scenes, the plot was incredibly weak and Milla J. looked about 45 in this flick. The movie certainly did not present her in the best light. Reading several reviews, I think people actually missed the real plot. Unfortunately, for those who missed the real plot, you have to watch it again. I feel for you. There goes 90 minutes of my life I will never get back. The only good thing about the movie were the graphics. Other than that, no other reason to watch it. SKIP IT!!!!!!"
3,No not a good movie but ...,The sound on my surround system was great. That's the reason I'm giving it 3 instead of 2 stars. Yes Milla is great too but there's not any sexy scenes or anything so if thats all your watching it for you might be disappointed.
3,More of a rental video,"We bought this movie because of mila jovanavich. However we would have been better off renting it. It didn't seem to have much of a plot. A lot of action yes, plot not so much. So if you are into action with out much of a plot this is definitely the movie for you. I guess the downer about it was it seemed to start in the middle and we spent most of the movie trying to figure out what was going on."
3,It was ok I guess,"This is an average movie. the fighting scenes were well done, the story was mediocre, and the special effects were great because they displayed some futuristic technology. What really drove me nuts is the chase scenes where it looks like a really bad video game. That put a big damper on the movie for me. It is an ok movie for a rental but I wouldn't buy it."
3,It was okay...but i think i'll wait for the next Resident Evil,"This movie was okay...nothing special. It just moved way to fast and made no sense to me at all. I really think that unless you are a fan of Ultraviolet or Milla Jovovich then u mite not like it. I am a fan of Milla's so lucklily watching her on the screen kept my attention throughout the movie....okay well most of the movie, i fell asleep towards the end..and didn't even bother to finish it (oh yea btw, saw this on bootleg, so maybe thats another thing that made it seem worse). So anyway i think i'll just wait for Resident Evil 3 to come out!!!"
1,UltraAwful,Terrible. Just another low budget CGI Hollywood action flick crap fest. Only saw the first 1/3 of this junk but that was more than enough. Zero stars. Some of the scenes and stupid dialogue might be funny if your stoned. If you watch mostly stuff like this it does to your brain what a steady diet of mostly candy and McDonald's does to your other organs.
1,"Technically good, bad edition...","The movie is bad. the only good thing are the effects and some ""new"" ideas (quite sure all that was already seen on hongkong).The whole is technically good, but the edition... lakcs of anything, i asume is the editor the problem and no the director, but is always the posibility that the director gives the poor guy nothing more to put on it!!.It remember me the first movie of an student. The story may be good, but bad told!!"
1,makes BloodRayne suddenly seem just a little better...,"Do NOT rent or buy this movie!I had seen some bad reviews, but I like Mila Jojvovichand the movie was made by the same people who made""Equilibrium"" which I totally LOVED.The movie makes Aeon Flux look like award winning stuff.Horrible dialouge, incomplete sets, cheap CGI, andI had lowered my expectations! I give it a complete FAwful. I have to go rent/buy something good to get the badtaste out of my brain.the ISLAND is probably a a C+ compared to this drek.You have been warned - the movie is a debacle.I would give it a zero if the rating scale allowed it.I will admit that visually the flaming sword fight had potentialbut other than that i just began hoping for the end of the movie"
3,Ultra-violent,"This movie borrows heavilyFrom others of its type,and comic books and video games,but it's not worth the hypeA futuristic settingA totalitarian regimeA dictator's lust for powerIs essentially the themeI've seen something just like itin Vendetta with a ""V""One hero dares to stand up toThe rogue Arch-MinistryA disease becomes pandemicYour blood cells it devoursVictims turn into ""vampires""With extra-special powersBut none so rare as VioletWhose eyes can see the sunAn expert in ""Gun Kata"" skillsand any type of gunShe infiltrates a guarded labAnd steals a death deviceThat's capable of wiping outVampires in a triceJust like Pandora and the boxShe can't resist, and peeksAnd finds out that the weaponMay have something she seeksAction packed with CGIThe plot is sadly lackingRent to look at Milla J.And then send this one packingAmanda Richards, September 8, 2006"
4,mad cool,"awesome..action never stops, fantastic butt-kicking fight scenes, super-high tech look to the entire film/actors airbrushed, buildings/vehicles sleek/fast paced, cool story..pay attention to the beginning for an overview of the storyline/ultraviolet's origin....a cross between xeon flux & dark angel..up there with with Underworld evolution as one of the best 2006 action/sci-fi/superhero flicks..so far..(X-Men 3 will sure be the best movie to come out this year..until then see Ultraviolet...can't wait to get this one on dvd!!!"
1,Extreme disappointment.,"I have no idea how a movie with so many fights, pretty special effects, and an attractive scantily clad actress managed to be boring, but, somehow, ""Ultraviolet"" manged it."
2,Well that's pretty neat.,"Okay, basically, this was a bad movie. A prime example of how special effects don't make up for plot and/or presentation.The best part of the entire film was the 12 second scene where she prints out a disposable cell-phone. That was the coolest thing I've ever seen.If you consider buying this movie, you'll be much better off renting it. Once is all you'll want to watch it, if that."
3,worth looking at...,"Kind of a eye candy movie, with pretty good action associatedwith the main character. Just like a comic book the fights arepretty unbelievable....but because the camera angles and the directionis pretty good, it gives the movie a boost.In line with Aeron Flux, but better than Bloodrayne ...except for theblood and guts department in which Bloodrayne rules.So yes, definitively is worth a showing or two. Get it second hand."
3,Entertaining,"Jovovich was great as always in her action movies. I liked the action, special effect and all the neat stuff like the anti gravity belt. However I felt the movie lacked a grasping plot that would keept my attention. I rewatch it to see the fighting scenes rather than an enjoyable plot."
3,"Weak plot, but entertaining","Nice visual, effects and fighting scenes, but the plot is quite weak.Still worth watching it, since the heroine is gorgeous, but be warned and don't go in expecting an outstanding movie."
2,Ultraviolet,Ultraviolet is filled with stunning visuals and amazing action. But it doesn`t make up for the terrible script with an OK plot. Milla Jovovich is not a very good actress and the rest of the actors in the film weren`t very good either. I wouldn`t recommend this film at all. One of the worst movies so far for 2006.
3,"Action, Style, Visual Pleasure","This movie has received universally abysmal reviews, so I thought I might like it. I was right. This is really no more vapid than most action movies. I think there has been more than a little female bashing going on in these reviews. The public can't tolerate a physically strong female lead. I found this movie much more fun than watching Rambo fire a machine gun for ten minutes straight.Although the script and plot were only somewhat better than Matrix (talk about abysmal), Milla Jovovitch, her personal trainer, and her costume designer really get an A+ for style and appeal. Don't go to this movie expecting a profound story or character development. Go for visual entertainment and fast paced action."
1,Don't bother with it...,"Ugh. This movie was one of the worst that I've seen in a while. It was hard for me to pay attention to it, and I almost always give my attention to movies in the theater.One of the problems with this movie is that the plot is hard to understand. During some parts I couldn't tell whose side everyone was on.Another thing is that the audience never really got to know each character. We never felt sorry when we thought someone was about to die because we just didn't know that character well enough.Everything was so fake looking, too. I'm not saying that's bad, I just thought I'd mention it. I'm sure it looks much better on the big screen than on the small screen.Also, I thought that the acting wasn't that great.Well, I guess I'm done ranting now. What I'm trying to say is that this movie is not worth your time. I was glad that I saw it at the dollar movie rather than wasting my $8 bucks or however much it is at the regular theater."
3,Good But Outdated,"I got this one because Bill Walton said it influenced him so much as a kid. I enjoyed reading it, but it wasn't as focused on the game as I expected. It is just as much concerned with how blacks were perceived at the time, and how Bill Russell dealt with that (and it IS valuable to get an inside period-perspective on what racism was like in the 60's, since history seems to be continually rewritten by TV and Hollywood).But some of the 'hip' language of the time dominates Russell's style, and was a bit distracting - a good lesson for would-be writers of the pitfalls of popular parlance.In the end, I only got a few of the nuggets of basketball wisdom I was looking for."
2,Never received my book,"Really wanted this book, but unfortunately, I never received it. Was refunded my price of the book but not the shipping and handling. Which was more than what I paid for the book. I will try and secure another edition at a later date and then get the chance to read it."
4,"As Sergeant Schultze used to say, ""I know nothing""","Reading this book you can almost inhale the mold spores from the airconditioner filters that run twenty four-seven in Scottsdale. I enjoyed the sleazy side of it very much. If you like motel rooms, 60's sitcoms, B&W; reel to reel video recorders and all those nice ladies who wait at the bar, then this is is it.By the end, I understood how hard it is to convict a suspect without a clear motive. ..."
1,LIES!,"Graysmith iosn't someone you wanna listen to considering he finished his book on Bob before the trial was even finished! Leaving a ton of things out isn't the way to inform people of a murder. Auto-Focus, the movie, is filled with lies and the director has publicly admitted to putting them in to make the movie sell. The book is no different. If you wanna read the real story of Bob Crane, this isn't it. At all!"

5,Life Changing,"This little book has been a HUGE blessing to me. I had always heard of the content of this book, and even had folks ""summarize"" it for me, but after reading it each sentence is already so condensed and specific that I can hardly imagine summarizing it further. A great little book that can be savored and read again and again as one man's journey to bypass all the hype and hoopla (yeah, I guess they even had it back in the 15th century!) and instead seek out the living God! A great book on application over theory and reality over philosophy.Also, I looked at several ""translations"" but really wanted to find one that didn't have other fluff...while I haven't read others, I can't imagine another translation more streamlined than this.Highly recommended for anyone seeking to LIVE a life of faith!"
4,For Working People Looking for a Deeper Spiritual (Everyday) Life,"If you are looking for something deep, short and practical, I highly recommend this little treasure.It encapsulates the philosphy of a man simply known as ""Brother Lawrence"", a lay brother who, previously a soldier, worked in a monastery kitchen. He shows the reader in his humble, direct and powerful manner, how he or she can experience God's presence in the rough-and-tumble of everyday life. He writes,""The time of business does not with me differ from the time of prayer, and in the noise and clatter of my kitchen, while several persons are at the same time calling for different things, I possess God in as great tranquility as if I were upon my knees at the blessed sacrament.""This book will be most helpful to those immersed (or drowning) in studies and/or work and looking for something more than fleeting moments of happiness, fulfillment and connection with God."
5,An excellent book!,"I first read just the 1st chapter of this book about 18 years old. With just that first chapter, I was able to experience a oneness with God on a level I had never gone before and I saw a vision of what my life would be like in the future.Well, 6 years later, I am actually seeing in my life the same things that God showed me in the vision.I couldn't find my old copy, so I just ordered a new one.It is DEEP! :-)"
4,Some good insights,"Brother Lawrence was a Catholic monk, so he did some things that I don't agree are Biblical (like suppressing his outward expression of the joy he felt in God and deliberately increasing his suffering from a physical problem so that he could suffer for his sins). He also never quoted Scripture to support his points (though often there was Scripture he could have used). However, overall, the book was God-focused and had some good insights.Due to the style of writing, it often took some thought for me to work out what he meant. The Spiritual Maxims were the more organized and easier to read of the two.Overall, this book may help people who are seeking insight on gaining a constant awareness of God and finding joy in His presence.Review by Debbie from ChristFocus Book Club (christfocusbookclub. blogspot. com)"
2,damn replays,"I was really disappointed with this video. The main reason for my disappoitment is the stupid highlight videos (instant replays)that kept on popping up during the matches. I hated these highlight videos because they ruined the flow of the match. It wasn't like they showed the videos while the wrestlers were laying exhausted on the floor doing nothing (like after a wrestler hits a plancha and then rests on the arena floor for a little while). They would do these instant replays during the middle of heated action. I remember even missing a 2 count (u could hear the ref counting to 2 in the background) due to one of the instant replays. What made it even worse was that the same instant replays that were shown during the matches, were also shown after the conclusions of the matches. What was the point of showing the same clip twice? I really hope that FMW will get rid of the instant replays for the next tape it produces."
2,FMW Is Hardcore,"I have watched this DvD and must say that for anyone who is a fan of TRUE Hardcore wrestling they should get this. For those unfamiliar with FMW, it is the TRUE Originator in Hardcore, Extreme Wrestling. It was the first to have the King of the Deathmathc Tournamet. It originated using lightbulbs, electrified barbwire, and EXPLOSIVES!!! The matches on the tape are some of the most extreme I have ever witnessed and I have been watching and following wrestling for 20 years. If you like Extreme and want to see the Real Mick Foley, AKA CACTUS JACK, and witness one the greatest wrestlers in the world before his injury, HAYABUSA, then Get this tape because if you don't then you are truly missing out."
3,FMW Yokohama Deathmatch,"Not the longest FMW dvd but still very good. Basically this is good for 3 main matches. Hayabusa vs Ganosuke in a Mask vs Hair Match, not a huge Hayabusa fan but this is definitely one of his better matches it's fast paced and it doesnt drag on forever rating 8, with background story about 24 min. Cactus Jack + Terry Funk + Mike Awesome vs Onita (FMW founder) + Kanemura + Tanaka in a 6 man Texas Tornado Match, barbed wire bat's, fire, tables, rematch from the fallout of The King Of The Death Match dvd, with background story about 20 min rating 8. Megumi Kudo vs Shark Tsuchiya in a 200 Volt Exploding Barbed Wire Death Match. This match is very good even better than her last match on KOTDM which I thought was slow. Shark pulls out everything trying to rid Kudo, blood, barbed wire and dangerous fire stunts in this match, with story about 27 min rating 9."
5,CACTUS JACK VS. TERRY FUNK,"If you`ve heard of Cactus Jacks` crazy hardcore matches and heard him being referred to as the King of the Deathmatch, but didn`t know what this was, then look no further because this video has the three goriest matches of his career...Thumb tacks, beds of nails, chains, plate glass, barbed wire boards, barbed wire ropes, explosive boards and even an exploding ring! It`s all here and uncensored!"
5,Refreshing!..This one is worth it!,Warren Barfield's self titled debut CD is the brightess and most creative of all the new comtempory Christian music. You wont be disapointed with this one. Warren is a very highly talented Christian voice that speaks love and healing to people of all ages. Each song comes from his heart and is refreshing in this day and age. He is a great Christian alternative to those who listen to Dave Matthews.
5,Awesome Experience,I love this cd. Warren Barfield is so talented. I recently saw him in concert and he was amazing. Even though it was just him and his guitar it was great. There are no bad songs on this cd. It's a cd you can play continously and not get tired of it. He reminds me of a young Steven Curtis Chapman. He has an excitement and love for God in his music.
1,"boring, dull and another little boy-sing-a-long","Oh, what a hype with Warren Barfield! The truth is: just another little boy-singing, absolutely boring, not worth hearing a second time. And I did not hear anything about God in his lyrics, all heartless and makes you fall asleep. Sometimes I think those 5-star-reviews are written by the producers of this definitely poor product. Sorry, but this is the truth."
4,Big Bill's #25 of 2001,"Electro. Retro. Warped. And Weird. Musically, this disc contains the freshest electronica around. Vocally, the songs are harmonious and catchy. Equal parts Beach Boys, Pavement, and To Rococo Rot. Best songs are Mr. Crow, One Dimension, and The Wisp."
3,a quirky read,"I can rarely tolerate books written in the first person and generally groan outloud on first page discovery and trudge on ruefully. I was gratefully (incredibly!!) pleased to find Claire's narrative all but invisible. YAY. Whilst it wasn't the best book I've ever read (Fingersmith, Secret Trilogy etc) I really enjoyed it. The funny thing is I can't say exactly why! Sometimes I found it frustrating, then funny and emotional on several levels. I liked the girls, the neighbours, the dog.. The author had you feel you knew them personally, almost like I was reading a very personal memoir. That's good writing to me and so was the parallel(?) storyline. Loved that, it worked well."
1,WHERE'S JOAN?,I listened to DARK CHORDS today and was shocked--JB turned hardrocker?! You don't even recognize her voice!!! Tell me I was hallucinating... We've waited 6 years for this?
1,dark is right,"i too have been a huge fan - since 1962-, and i have loved just about everything she's ever done, inCLUDing her last 2 efforts. but this album is so dark, overproduced, and disjointed, with song selections that don't seem to fit either together or ms baez. lighten up, joannie :)"
2,"Fine songs, atrocious recording","Obviously most reviewers enjoyed this album very much, and I have been a fan of Baez since the early 1960's. But for me the tasteful selection of songs is overshadowed by the worst engineering I have heard on a commercial relaese in decades. Joan and the instruments seem to be in different acoustic spaces and the entire recording is distorted with a buzzy quality that sounds like a mistracking phono cartridge. I actually thought something had gone wrong with my electronics until the next CD came on. If you can live with the wretched sound (listen to the samples online - the CD is no better) it's the best Baez in some years."
5,The Best Joan Baez Album Yet!,"I have been listening to Joan Baez since the 60's, and have continued to follow her through the decades, having seen her perform live several times. To my taste, this album is the best one she has ever done. Her voice has matured and is even more beautiful, and her selection of material for this album is outstanding. I absolutely love the songs, and play the CD over and over without ever getting at all tired of it."
5,a great studio album,"I wish something special to do justice for Joan's great new album Dark Chords on a Big Guitar, like a gold album or a Grammy Award. Dark Chords is simple ones of her best studio records. A masterpiece. When I heard the album for the first time, the songs, arrangements and lyrics I am convicted that Joan Baez proved the power of her talent. On most tracks of the album is the dark atmosphere that brings her to her best. I must not forget to relate that her voice still sound beautiful. In My time of Need, Motherland, Caleb Meyer and Wings are amongst my favorites songs. And Christmas in Washington proved that she still attend to protest music"
3,"Fun, mid-90s anime","While not the greatest anime in terms of plot, complexity or surprises, Zeorymer is entertaining mecha action with some interesting mechanical, character and costume designs. Not a true gem of the genre but well worth the discount price it can be found for these days."
4,Technical Metal at its finest!,"I found this disk in a second-hand cd store, and after listening to it on the store cd player I rushed to buy it. The cost was 99cents. I have grown to love this cd. If you like progressive and/or technical metal like Savatage or Dreamtheater then you will like this. The music quality is just as good. Very technical, very fast, lots of tempo changes and differing time signatures. Very much like some of the early Metallica, but much more emphasis on composition. The quality of the mixing and tracking is not the best for obvious reasons, but I think that adds to the mystery of the music. You've never heard of them and except for here you probably never will again. Trust me! Buy this album now. It's well worth the money."
5,A must for design start,What a great rescource for someone trying to make those needed changes. Just getting started is aleays the most difficult of any task. This book assists in getting anyone well on their way.
5,supercharged Mustang,"This was a Christmas gift to my friend, Jeff. He was excited when he received it and took it on his one week vacation. He said that it addressed issues related to supercharging the 5.0 that he was concerned about, like compression ratio and cylinder heads. As soon as he returned he crawled ubder his car to verify that he had the recommended rear axle."
1,WAITING,I'd like to reveiw this book as I have waiting to receive this book. I'll be waiting for this book to be shipped.James Holder
2,Read a Mag instead its cheaper,"I had been waiting to afford this book, when i read it though, its very dated it was written in 1994, a lot has changed scince then, i have learned far more from mags than this, i dont know why it gets such high rating when it cost more than 100$ brand new...you can get far more up to date info from online archives from the majore mustang mags..Stay away from this unless its about 20$$...but thats just my take...."
2,Past its Prime...,"At the time Bill Mathis was writing his ""handbooks"", the internet wasn't immediately available to everyone, nor were forums really existing.. so information exchange like this is quite a goldmine.. anyhow, the suspension to be built from this book is easily attainable already prefabbed by MANY companies nowadays And isn't really necessary to fabricate anymore.. He recommends using a lot of factory parts as well that are no longer necessary to use due to other innovations via the aftermarket. As far as the theory and engineering behind the parts built and learning from that, Bill himself has came onto widely used mustang forums and made remarks that the publishers, more concerned with shelf appearance .. highly edited the handbooks and therefore significant information is INFACT MISSING.. In the end, if the book were still 12-15.00 I think it'd be worth having for flipping through.. other than that, you should be doing some serious research here online.."
1,A FLAT EASTERN PLAIN,THERE IS A MAP TO FOLLOW THE FLIGHT SCENERY>>BUT THE VIDEO SEEMED DULL AND BORING WITH LITTLE SCENIC IMPACT
5,A True Original That Will Make You Hungry,"This delightfully eccentric book tells the story of the Red Fox, a celebrated chef who works for the King on the planet Epsilon. He is slyly offered twice as much money to accompany the four ""Cinnamon Bears"" on their spaceship ""The Bearscout,"" and he (illegally) accepts their offer and embarks on a memorable journey, where he must whip up various fondues and pastries while getting involved in a variety of horrors and adventures. You have to appreciate a book where no matter what happens (mummy attacks, questionable decisions by former commando ""Grandma,"" and battles with the ""Cyber-Wolf"" and the ""celebrated pig, Rudin Smoke"") the overriding concern of all the characters is to get a good, well-cooked meal. This book is best for sci fi/fantasy fans High School and older who are at least slightly loopy themselves."
5,Funny and Original,"This is a really funny book. It's got talking animals and funny illustrations, like a classic children's book, but its also got a space story - a bit like Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but with a better story. Also, the main character, the Red Fox is a cook, so there's lots of cooking. I was hungry after I read it. This will probably appeal to anyone who likes the Harry Potter type mixture of adventure with comedy. Very original and worth reading."
4,A quality printer for a low budget artist.,"Warning: No custom size available for any OS after Windows XP. I had to install XP in a virtual machine, then install the Printer's driver within. Once set up properly, I have been using this printer vigorously on custom sizes from 11X10 -> 11X50 and it has been very reliable, print after print. The quality is not the best due to low dpi capabilities but hey this is an old printer and I love it! :D"
1,HP 1220C,"Very unsatisfactory experience, Item was shipped with ink cartridges installed, ink ALL OVER THE PLACE, Item was returned to the seller, American Express is debiting the charges,"
3,Wrong but Useful.,"What you have to remember is that AJP Taylor didnt believe AJP Taylor.Origins is a deliberately provocative contrarian look at the origins of the war: excellent for history students to debate against, but certainly not the first or last word for the casual reader."
5,A great work of scholarship by a master historian.,"Dubbed as a ""revisionist history"" when the book was first written, A.J.P. Taylor's scholarship has withstood the test of time and a fresh reading is testimony to his prophetic skills. Mr. Taylor's work demonstrates that there are no blacks and whites but only grays in the world of realpolitik. His work is both for the casual reader as well as for students of history. (Naushad Shafkat)"
4,Presents a good number of dance steps,"I liked this book because it presented around 8 or so dance steps for each dance. Other books present only 3-4 very simple steps, not enough to feel confident on a socal dance floor. Its alittle difficult for the absolute beginner since foot diagrams are largely missing for the more complex steps (its hard to follow written descriptions)."
4,real good debut,"a really terrific debut, but not what it coulda been. after the first few songs, tunes tend to run into each other. don't get me wrong, there really isn't a bum song on this, but it's like because she had some first rate classics that'll be played on radio for years all picked out, and she basically tried to take the formula for the rest of the album and ended up with a hit/miss proposition. not bad, just not as outstanding as the first 3 or 4 songs. props to her for having neal casal in her touring band(and if ya don't know him, ya better grab anything you can on this site 'for it's all gone...). lotsa talent, great looks, swell voice, she's on the right track. and thats good."
5,Jukebox Sparrows,"What a find! Thank you Amazon for recommending Shannon McNally. While she has her own fresh blues style, if you like Bonnie Raitt, and Sheryl Crowe, you'll love Shannon McNally. I love ""Bury my heart at the Jersey Shore."""
4,McNally Steals Lynne's Thunder,"A funny thing happened while we were waiting for the new Shelby Lynne CD to come blow us away. Shannon McNally stole her thunder. While tapping a similar country-blues-pop vein as Lynne's Grammy winning effort of last year, McNally has, in her debut album, made a record every bit as gratifying. At the place where Sheryl Crow bumps into Lucinda Williams, McNally has crafted a string of sterling songs which, while immediately accessible, grow in stature and strength with each listening. She is a superb singer, capable of displaying both vulnerability and balls, whichever the occasion calls for. McNally is ably assisted by a bunch of familiar names as co-writers and musicians. This, thus far, unheralded CD is a real find and a refreshing antidote to those getting far more hype, including the overproduced and ultimately disappointing new Shelby Lynne."
4,Boston: Guitar Play-Along DVD Volume 31,"I was sitting around, Smokin', when I got More Than a Feeling reminiscing about the Long Time ago when I was in a Rock & Roll band. I couldn't get any Peace of Mind, so I got onto Amazon, started browsing, saw this DVD and thought, ""Let me Take You Home Tonight"". Well, it didn't happen than night, but Amazon shipped it quickly which gave me some Piece of Mind. I Don't Look Back on the purchase. Like the other Hal Leonard DVDs, it is fun to play along to the tracks and if you play guitar, the songs are pretty quick to learn. Four stars because the interface could be better for learners with a feature to slow down the tracks. Other than that, enjoy."
2,POS,"Useless because I got the wrong size, so they will be sitting in the basement for who knows how long."
5,Nice glue sticks for the price,They are glue sticks and work as advertised. So much cheaper than buying them at a crafting store! Would purchase again.
3,"Third time, same review","The Jedi Council sets suffer from weak figure and sculpt choices for previously issued characters. It also is confusing in that it is a cross between the Episode I and Episode II Jedi councils. Now there are some unique characters that haven't been offered in any other setting as well now reduced to only Depa Bilpa and Opo Ranciss. Considering that most of these other figures are now considered Super Articulated you could get by getting the a set of six floors and their chairs to make the council chamber and fill them with better figures for the most part.However the figures aren't the ""star"" of this set as much as the council chamber is. While the color is inaccurate it does the job well enough for display provided you have a fairly deep shelf (18""or so), but it won't fall or drop if only 12"" deep."
1,Sensor Bar Wireless,This item arrived as expected; used batteries very fast. Had to purchase wired sensor bar
1,Wii wireless sensor bar,"This product only works with fresh batteries and it doesn't last very long, a couple hours at the most. You have to keep getting up and hitting the power button and then it only stays on for about two minutes. It is not worth the money."
1,WORTHLESS!,"I hate giving bad reviews but when you must, you must. This was given to me because my roommate's rabbit ate through my wired sensor bar. Well, I was happy that I did not have to worry about wires. Good Grief. I cant play ANY games that require me to point the wiimote at the screen. it only works if all the curtains are closed and there is very little light. And after 2 hours it shuts off? What the hell? Waste of my roommate's money, waste of plastic, waste of my batteries and a waste of MY money. I had to go out and buy a wired sensor bar. This product totally turned me off ALL wireless sensor bars. BAH!"
2,not worth the money,"bought this thinking it would be easier to not have the wires everywhere, but it never picked up our remotes. Tried changing batteries, and still nothing. ended up throwing away and bringing back the original one."
2,"Disappointing phone: worked at first, then loud buzzing","I have had many Panasonic cordless phones over the years, and never had any problems with them, so it was an easy decision to choose Panasonic again. Unfortunately, this phone doesn't live up to other model's performance. It worked fine for a couple of weeks, but now there is a loud buzzing noise (only can be heard on my end, but loud enough to obscure the voice of the person I'm talking to), and the volume doesn't increase enough to cover the buzzing. Similar problems have been indicated by other reviewers - wish I had listened to them before I bought this phone.I am going to return the phone, and am quite disappointed."
1,Malfunctioning phone,"Unfortunately, I've only had the phone for a couple of months and it is already not working. I cannot hear the person on the other end of the line. I will have to have it either repaired or replaced."
4,Very good for an extra - cordless phone,This is a very good cordless phone (for an additional phone in your household). It doesn't have the answering machine portion so it's not for a main household phone. Everything else though is fine. The 5.8 GHz will alleviate any interference problems with your other electronic (transmitting) devices!
1,Lousy phone,"Unless you suffer from extreme hearing loss, this is not the phone for you. Voice enhanced,it is very difficult to keep the booster off (it keeps reappearing no matter what you select) and as a result the voice on the other end blasts at you.The menu is exceedingly difficult to navigate with limited choices. Basically you better just want to use the phone directory or try adjusting the booster. Everything else is difficult to capture.Though it is a nice design, every call I made or received was full of static (the antennae were fully extended and the phone in that same spot previously never had any such problems for 8 years.) The static was so interfering that I was asked repeatedly to take the call on another phone.Bottom line, I chucked the phone and ordered another roduct."
1,Old technology - do not buy,"My KX-TG5612 loses connection with the base unit all of the time. Plus, it does not have the newer security and encryption that came out with the DECT 6.0 units. Do not buy the TG5621. Buy this or one like it:Panasonic KX-TG6512B DECT 6.0 PLUS Expandable Digital Cordless Phone System, Black, 2 Handsets"
1,Worst cordless phone ever,"This absolutely the worst cordless phone I have ever used, cuts out, can't hear over the speaker. Don't buy it!!!!"
1,Keep you money!!!,"When i bought this cordless i assume because is a Panasonic product,... was going to be excellent , but guess what? is the worst cordless i ever have in my life, we can't listen to nobody because the voice reception is very low, sometimes we cut the call because we assume none is in the other side,but seconds after we hand-off, our friend or relatives call to our cellphone because they know already what the problem is.my advice for you is to look for a better cordless because this one is a garbage."
2,"Pretty to look at, ugly to hold","After 4 months, the line noise and background static on this phone are incredibly frustrating. And Panasonic's on-line support does not acknowledge the problem, or include in their troubleshooting guides. I'm throwing this one out and replacing today."
1,Don't Purchase This Product,I have been happy for years purchasing and using Panasonic telephones but this one is totally unsatisfactory. The incoming volume is so low that it is very difficult to hear the caller unless the person has a booming voice. Panasonic claims to have a voice enhanced feature but it does not work. Interferance is also a problem with this 5.8GHz phone.
1,Very Dissapointed,"I'm throwing this one away. I agree with other review that complain about sound quality. Isn't that the point afterall, particularly with a land line. Don't waste your money. You too will throw it away"
1,Very disappointed,"I have had several Panasonic phones in the past, always have been happy. So, when I decided to upgrade and get a new phone with the 5.8 GHz (must be even better than 900 or 2.4, right??) Boy, was I disappointed. At first, I was very happy. It looks nice, flashes several colors when it rings, can pick ""sing songy"" ring tones. On the second day of use, I was having a hard time hearing the other person. I blamed it on their phone, mine was, after all brand new. It couldn't be my new phone. On the 3rd day, I was barely able to hear anyone on the other end at all. I'd run to the old phones in the house to use to continue my conversation. By the end of the week, I would answer the phone, the person could hear me, I couldn't hear them at all!! That was it. The phone went back. I'm sticking to my old phones and shopping around a little more. I'm going to check with consumer reports next time. Don't buy this phone."
5,Fantastic & Great Deal,I have used a lot of cordless phones over many years and this is one of the best ever. The sound quality is excellent. The interface is completely intuitive. It is a great size. The speakerphone built into the handset works really well. I just saw this same phone for $20 more at another site so this is also a great price.
1,Faulty Piece,"I am not sure if somebody else faced the same experience. When I bought this phone, I was successful in registering the cordless with the base. The phone worked fine for first 2-3 days.Later, I started getting the 'System busy' message. When I tried to re-register it used to give me Error!I had no choice but to return the product."
1,can't hear,Don't buy these phones. You can't hear anything on the other line. We bought two and hate them. We'll never by a Panasonic phone again.
1,Nothing but problems after just 1 week of use.....,AVOID AT ALL COST!!!! (Scroll down and look at all the bad reviews listed here first)I advise anyone who is thinking of buying this phone to reconsider there choices and buy a different model. I am a big fan of Panasonic and always buy this brand of phones. However after reciving this model of phone it hasn't work right since after the first week of use. Either I get no dial tone or if your lucky enough to get a dial tone it doesn't dial out or hang up right. I can't even leave the phone hooked into the jack because it causes a busy signal on my phone line from not hanging up properly. It's not my phone jack or set up I've tried all kinds of different phone jacks and wasy of fixing this. It has to be the phone!!!!
2,Rapid deterioration,"When I first got this phone, I thought it was great. However, over three months of use, the sound quality gradually deteriorated so that now, it is becoming difficult to hear the person on the other end over a loud background hum. I have removed numerous potential sources of interference, such as electronic equipment, to no avail, and other phones on the same line do not experience the problem, so I can only conclude that the fault lies with this phone."
2,better luck with Uniden,"Ordered this model to fix the common interference problem with my wireless Internet and to give it credit, this phone does accomplish this. However, when next to the router the phone still cuts out. Biggest issue however was that the volume was very low and I could barely hear the other party on the line. Panasonic was great offering many trouble shooting advice but none worked. Amazon took the item back for credit. Now I'm happily using the uniden TRU8860 which hasn't cut out (even when I'm on the phone next to the router) and the volume is really clear... plus it's cheaper! (34.99 + shipping)."
2,Erratic Volume,"My wife and I look for another phone when they are ringing. The volume can be good at times but ""bad"" most of the time. Voice enhancement does not help or hender. Have another Panasonic (TG 2420) that I am completely happy with."
5,"Stunning, Stunning, Stunning","I just recently got into Jeff's music & I am still reeling from the beauty, honesty & sheer brilliance that is in his stuff. I just picked up this ""Legacy Edition"" of ""Grace"" about 3 hours ago, & I have to say that it is beautifully packaged with expanded artwork, a gorgeous tri-fold case that holds the 2 cd's & the DVD of the making of ""Grace"", & of course, extensive commentary on the bonus tracks in a very attractive booklet with lots of stunning photos of Jeff & his band. If I sound like a fanatic, it's because Jeff's music & words inspire such incredible passion in fans of his music.For those not wanting to plop down $26 or so dollars for such a beautiful work of art, then I strongly suggest that you scrounge up $12 bucks & buy the ""Grace"" cd. After hearing that, I guarantee that you'll jump head-first into the gorgeousness of Jeff's legacy."
2,Witless,"I had high hopes for this book, which were not realized. The stories, while occasionally amusing, are generally not written terribly well; the plots are transparent, the characters all sterotypes. Some of the entries are page and a half long sentances. I feel pretty ripped off that I paid full price for this."
3,For serious study into Europe's Magic Kingdom,"Lainsbury is a brave author for not following the mainstream thought of attacking Disneyland Paris, just because it has seemed the thing to do since the project was first announced.He used a complete library, and did a good job of compiling the sentiments contained in those other works. Having written a literature report on Euro Disney myself, I appreciate the references he has included in this book and the added information from first-hand interviews with big names like Marty Sklar, Tony Baxter, Bill Cottrell, Tim Delaney, Ward Kimball and Card Walker.Don't look for any pictures in this book and one third of its pages are bibliographical notes, but if you are seriously interested in the real story of Euro Disney Resort, this book should be on your shelf."
1,Unnecessary book,The story of Euro Disneyland is an exciting topic and therefor I purchased 'Once upon an American dream'. I was both dissappointed by both content and style. I am affraid that even a high school student would have written a more superior and more enticing storey. Please do not waste your money on this book.
1,Terrible streaming for a classic movie,"It was really frustrating watching Friday in HD on Amazon through a Roku. The stream stopped 10 different times during the movie. Multiple times, the stream did not restart, took us back to the Roku home screen, and forced us to reload the movie. A few times, we had to wait to reload the movie because Amazon's server wasn't working. Bad experience."
3,Came Up Short For Me,"This album doesn't compare to either Stackin Chips or Real Talk 2000. The only good song is the last track with 2Pac. Besides that song this CD is just a bunch of filler tracks with maybe a good song or two mixed in. However, 3x Krazy does come with some more good flows on the mic. The production let them down a bit on this one, but if you're a big 3x fan then I'm sure you'll want to buy this one.Read a full track by track review at:<...."
4,mediocre to good condition,it arrived quickly and was a little more beat up than I wanted but it still looks fine and isn't falling apart or anything.
3,The journey ends before success,"A devotee of Brian Tracey, I jumped at the opportunity to read this book on success. Unfortunately, the journey ends before he succeeds contrary to the title. After spending half the book getting on the journey and into Africa, Tracy then spends the other half of the book crossing the Sahara desert. The book ends abruptly! You do not finish the journey. I was left wondering about the ""end game"" of success. Maybe Brian will write another book describing the end of the journey."
3,The Alchemist meets Lawrence of Arabia,I just finished reading The Alchemist and saw Lawrence of Arabia some time before.It is clear to me now where Brian got his literary inspiration.This book can be summed up as The Alchemist meets Lawrence of Arabia. Probably that's how he pitched this book to his publisher.There is nothing profound or original in this book.
1,The Sorrow and the Pity,This DVD is all French with no English subtitles. Since I have no knowledge of French cannot understand what is being said.
2,Not one of Stephen Chow's better films,"Those of you looking for the sarcastic wit married with slapstick and physical humor you would expect from a Stephen Chow movie should move along, as there is nothing much to see here. Those familiar with Hong Kong cinema will expect disjointed storytelling, often seeming as if the entire movie was improvised. If you are fluent in Cantonese, you would be able to follow the dialogue. But if you are depending on the subtitles, be prepared to get only about 75% of what is going on.All in all, an average movie, but seeing as how this is one of Chow's earlier works, a forgivable effort. It is a glimpse at Chow before he came into his own as an actor and director."
5,J. K. Lasser's Strategic Investing After 50,"This book is easy to understand, concise and informative. The chapters are short with each topic throughly explained.But this book is far more than strategies after 50. As soon as I finished reading this book I ordered the book for my sons - ages 37 and 40. In fact, in my judgment it is appropriate for anyone who wants to learn, in simple terms, the theories of investing."
5,Great rhyming dictionary,"I use several different rhyming dictionaries in my songwriting. After hearing Stephen Sondheim mention this one in an interview, I decided to try it. Now it's my favorite. What's different about this one is that the list of words matching a particular rhyme is presented as a single column of words, making it very easy to scan. I hope this dictionary goes back into print."
5,Then!,"A true masterpiece. An awesome performance and record of the music created by one of the best groups playing Fusion of our time, my life was worth it after hearing THIS!"
4,Another great live Holdsworth performance!,"This is the first live Holdsworth I've found containing ""Non Brewed Condiment"". It's the highlight of the CD AND he plays it on electric guitar instead of SynthAxe which is a treat! Sound production is solid. I would have given this 5 stars had it not been for the limited tracks and a couple of the selections would not have been my first choice. But a must for all Holdsworth heads."
3,Not necessarily the Crime of the Century,"This book was written by the investigators of the 1966 crime which makes it more of a forensic novel -- more in line with modern crime stories. The plot follows the actions of mass killer Richard Speck who brutally bound, tortured and killed 8 Chicago nurses. In the confusion of his murderous frenzy, one nurse managed to slither under a bed, unnoticed, and later identified Speck as the killer.After recently meeting this sole survivor, I purchased The Crime of the Century for some of her friends to better understand what happened nearly 40 years ago."
4,A Good Source,"A well written, easy to read guide for those seeking a broad overview on allergies. Some of the information is out dated, but the basic info is current. As a nurse entering into a new field of practice, this was a good go to for basic info. It is written for the patient, but I found it very helpful in assisting me to get adjusted to this new field of practice."
3,just another textbook,This textbook is just another pedogogical reference that fails to elucidate the complexities of school finance clearly
2,Majority of the tracks are Single versions or Edits!,"Great song selection BUT why not include the album versions instead of the K-tel single edits or special edits. C'mon, this band deserves better. If the customer wanted the edits, but the single disc collection. For the fans should have received the full album versions!"
4,Sharp 15 LCD TV,"Very pleased with the tv. Really fits anywhere, I have in the bedroom, so light you can place it on the end of the bed if you like. After the set up the picture, sound, audio etc your ready to go. This is my fifth Sharp TV need I say more."
1,Total Rip-Off,"Based on the product desciption from the Amazon website, i ordered what was supposed to be a NEW TV from this seller, but what i got almost a month after i placed the order was a REFURBISHED unit with a defective screen. So far, Amazon has been of no help saying that since it's a third party seller, they aren't getting involved."
1,Range is awful,"I have checked the manual to see if there was something I could do to improve the range of the handset. Their suggestion was to move the base unit elsewhere. Its a answering machine and phone charger I don't want it elsewhere. I have had other cordless phones in the same location with no problems. I threw away the extra handset because it was of no use. The range I get is, in the same room or maybe up to 30 feet away. Vtech has lost me as a customer forever."
3,DISAPPOINTED,"I recently purchased the A5859, and must say that I am disappointed with its performance. It has no back-up, so that when I've had power failures, I've had to reprogram in all my data, including, dates, day, time, etc. The instructions are not easy to understand either, and there are numerous features, that are difficult to figure out."
2,Supposedly NEW phone,"Although the seller was quick in responding and accepted responsibilty for return shipment, and a full refund - I feel that they did NOT advertise this product honestly. It stated it was a NEW PHONE SYSTEM - instead it was a REFURBISHED unit which by the way did NOT WORK. The word REFURBISHED was never mentioned in their discription, if it had been I would NEVER have purchased it."
1,Horrible.......,"This product was originally given good marks by Consumer Reports..... so thats why I bought it, but it's a piece of garbage. Like other reviews, no range at all. Also, lots of static and hissing and pops on the line with this phone. The previous phone I had was a 900mhtz phone and I could go to my neighbors house and talk clearly. Not with this piece of dung. I'd be lucky to be able to go into the next room. VTech blows."
3,Not the most thorough bio but very good synopses,"If you're looking for detailed biographies of George III's children, this isn't the book, but it's excellent as a resource for basic information regarding the lives. It gets very, very complicated, trying to remember which child is the Duke of whatever, so I had to keep referencing the family tree, but that's not the fault of the author, it's simply a result of the king and queen's fertility."
4,More than a dozen Hanoverians,"George III and Queen Charlotte had fifteen children in exactly twenty-one years, all but two of whom survived to adulthood. They included George IV, William IV, and a collection of royal dukes (some of whom had large families of illegitimate children) and princesses (most of whom married late or never). Until the middle of the 20th century, the family had a poor collective reputation, largely the product of propaganda by Whig politicians and historians. The publication of previously unseen correspondence and diaries has led to a degree of rehabilitation, but the Hanoverians probably will never rate highly with later generations. This isn't just a collection of brief biographies but an informative study of the interrelationships among the siblings, their extra-familial connections within and outside the court. Van der Kiste has produced a number of mini-dynastic studies of this sort, of which this volume is perhaps the most useful because of the earlier period it covers."
4,Father Time - He is indeed,"I enjoyed this book a great deal, much more than some of the others in the story arc. Even without a memory of who he really is, the Doctor is still the unpredictable and ever resourceful person we have always known and loved. At each cliffhanger I found myself wondering ""How is he going to get out of this one?"" and was pleasently surprised when it was in the Doctor's usual, unconventional style. My only disappointment was the actual ending. Only this prevents my giving it 5 stars--it's total predictability. I had deducted this impending outcome by the end of the first ""book"" and was hoping against hope that I was completely wrong. All in all, a good read and wonderful, romping adventure(s)"
5,Solid book,"Lance Parkin is a very good author of Doctor Who novels. His work on Father Time was good, and kept the reader entertained all the way through."
5,Great family game and a lot of fun for the whole family.,My kids love this game and played with their Grandpa when we visited him. Now we have bought our own and play it at home for game night. It is a great way to have fun with the family.
5,Fun Game,"Bought this as a Christmas gift and she loved it. This game really makes you think and use your brain - very fast shipping,"
5,Rummikub,Everyone who we know who has ever played it enjoys it. It is a quick and easy game to learn and comprehend. Our 9 year old granddaughter took to it immediately and became a regular winner. The only limitation is that it can only be played by up to 4 players. Can two sets be combined so that up to 8 can play?
3,The game is great but the tile holder is for the birds.,"The game is great, a lot of fun and also makes you think. Winning is only about 10% luck and 90% using your brain. However, the plastic stand that hols the tiles is not very good. It cant hold the tiles properly, too easy to tip over and spill all the tiles. Five stars for the game, 1 star for the tile holder."
5,Rumikub,Great game for adults as well as children - becomes addictive! Even better with the new sturdier stands which was the only disadvantage of the old set.
2,Rummikub,"I purchased this game for a neighbor because I have enjoyed my game for years. However, the quality of this game is not as good as my game. The paint on the numbers is easily scratched and not holding up. I have never had that problem with my older version of this game. It's a shame that the quality has deteriorated from then to now."
5,Lots of Fun!,I bought Rummikub as a family Christmas present this year.Pros: The game is a surprising amount of fun to play for both adults and kids. Our (12 & 13) play it with us as well as their friends; and our adult friends enjoy it as well.Cons: The only con is that the tile holder is pretty cheap and it is easy to accidentally bump it and knock tiles all over.
5,Rummikub - a game for all ages,Product came quickly and in very good shape. Had to buy one because our 30+ daughter kept borrowing it for her friends.
5,Rummikub Game,"Great game, a lot of fun for the family. I would recommend this to anyone, a great addition to our game night."
1,unhappy,I have always liked this game but the quality of this product was very poor. The tiles are about the size and as thin as a cheez it.
2,Not my favorite board game.,"One of the biggest problems with this game is the instructions. I have a lot of board games and this is worst than Monopoly's. I still don't know how to add up points and me and my wife read the directions a thousand times. You have to ASSSSUUUUME. Blah.The game play it's self lags too because you have to TALLY. It's pretty annoying having to write points down every 30 seconds.I would say this is one of the worst games I have ever played.Between horrible instructions and tallying this just can't be fun.Now the actual game is fun, not super fun but it's fine. It's just the other things get in the way.I would only suggest this to 1. Anal Retentive people. 2. People who love math. 3. People who love Rummy and are out of things to do."
5,Fun for the whole family,"This is a great game for the families with children 7 years and older. My 7 year-old and 11 year-old are learning to be creative with numbers, which is great and they frequently ask to play the game with mom and/or dad. We actually checked the game out from the recreation center on vacation because the girls wanted to play. It's just an overall excellent game."
5,Good quality,"When I was a child my family loved to play Rummikub. Now that I'm married and a homeowner, I decided we needed our own copy of the game. Compared to the earlier version, which my parents still have, this set has much nicer tiles and sturdy boards on which to prop the tiles."
3,Your mileage may vary,"There is no other table-top game that consumes more of my time than Rummikub. I find it very addicting.However, your experience may vary depending on the version. I had the version with ""easy-grip contour"" pieces. After a lot of play, the paint has chipped away to the point that many pieces are unreadable causing me to need to buy a new set. This is not a problem with the editions with engraved pieces.BUYER BEWARE: I ordered this set from Amazon because it said that it had engraved pieces. The version I received though did not. If you look at all of the pictures for this product, you can see that many different versions are represented. I assure you, they are not all created equal."
5,Review,This is in great shape and is exactly what I anticipated it to be. This is going to make a great gift
2,Rummikub,"I couldn't use the game because the colors are not distinct enough of each other, especially the blue. I had to give it away"
3,Count Your Tiles,"I bought this item for some elderly relatives who play rummy with cards. This toy is perfect for them because they don't have to hold playing cards. The plastic rack holds all their tiles while they play. No more sore or cramped hands.One draw-back... It came with ""3"" orange 9s instead of two. There is only ""1"" orange 8 instead of two. Hopefully, the manufacturer will make up the difference."
2,Not what I expected.,"I was hoping for the large print tiles, and the numbers are even smaller than normal. Not worth the money."
2,Rummikub,Much too flimsy...tiles continuously fall off the holders...child 8 years old became frustrated with it...I would not order it again
4,I love the game,This version has light weight plastic tiles and is good for traveling. Great mind workout. Good for the whole family.
4,I really love this game!,The game is a lot of fun to play once you get into it. I played it at a camp retreat and we kept playing it for hours!
4,Rummicub - even my husband can play,I love games and my husband does not. This game is simple to learn but a bit complex in its execution. Keeps you thinking. Even a non-gamer found it enjoyable
1,Where is my Rummikub?,I rated it one star because i havent even recieved it yet. Where is it? It has been over one month.Heather Reid
4,Complex plot,"As many have written here the plot is complex. So complex if you take, say, a phone call without stopping the video you may miss an important twist."
4,Complex plot with twists and turns ...,Sit down and focus your attention on this one. The plot is well structured but it wanders all over the place with affairs and sub-plots. I think everyone lived happily ever after and the bad guys went to jail. Somehow you are never quite sure what really happened at the crime scene. Movie was well cast.
3,saved by Tom Selleck,"Kind of herky-jerky, but saved by Tom Selleck who can save just about anything. The music added to the poor score I gave -- really, really bad music."
4,Great movie,"I first saw this movie on TV and after watching it I had to buy it. What a great movie, lots of twists and turns. This is a most buy."
4,RevErrLjh,William Macy and Tom Selleck are great as usual. There are a few twists and turns in the story that keep you watching. Solid plot. I recommend for agood movie to watch on a rainy afternoon.
4,Enjoyed,Enjoyed the movie - we are Tom Selleck fans and always enjoy his movies.Probably wouldn't use the vendor again as it took 3 weeks to receive the DVD.
3,Sigh.,"I downloaded their song Stab from the One Day Saviour website a while before the album came out, and I freaking loved the song, so along came the album, and guess what...no pretty singy stuff at all almost besides the part in Stab. At times it just sounds like they are saying 'Lookee we can play our guitar and double-bass really fast!' If they'd just stop showing off, and start singing once in a while, I would adore them. So if you dig showboaty assault-rifle-sounding guitars and drums and some random guy screaming into what sounds like a telephone, peep it."
5,I had suspicions...,"After reading so much negative material about Amway and almost being downtrodden by negative thinkers, I decided to pick up this book and see what it was all about. I was so pleasantly surprised that someone who was not actively involved with the company held such positive views that I had to check it out. This book helped me to realise that so many people just want to cut you down because they are not willing to pay the price for success. I have since begun building what is growing to be a substantial Amway business and I am forever grateful to Shad for writing this book!"
2,Want to make a lot of money? Write a book supporting Amway!,"Having been an Amway distributor for the past seven years, I am beginning to understand the Amway experience (nightmare). I have seen and read many books and articles supporting the opportunity. I have also read many reports slamming Amway. In his book, Helmstetter is yet another Amway apologist, showing us how the business ready to explode. What he lacks are the real facts. I do give him credit, though, he understands the power of making money - simply write a pro-Amway book and millions of dreamy-eyed Ambots will purchase it (hence my high rating.) Sorry to say this, Amazon, but your customers should save their money."
5,Amazing,"I found the portions written by Clayton Peddy to beAmazing, I can not stress how much this book changedthe way I think about the subject"
3,"Which comes first, the chicken or the egg?","After going through all the labs prepared by Microsoft on MCS 2002 and MCMS 2002, I dove into this book. Here are my findings:DO NOT buy this book if you are looking for a ""how to"", or if you are a newbie to MCS and MCMS.This book explains items found in MCS and painfully briefly on MCMS (one chapter), it glosses over the 'how to' and expects that you already know that.DO buy this book if you already know a good portion of how to manage and configure CS and MCMS, then this book would do a good job of providing more details above and beyond what is provided in Microsofts documentation.The book is exactly this - ""which comes first, the chicken or the egg"", because it expects you to know how to manage and configure, yet by the time I get to that level of expertise, there ain't no way I would buy this book because it wouldn't help me."
1,-5 Stars - Worthless and next to useless,"Don't waste your time with this book, The sample site doesn't build the examples they do give in the book aren't even used in their code. If you plan on building a commerce server web site and don't know commerce server already this book won't help you. In fact, even if you do know commerce server this book won't help you. With out a doubt the most worthless, development book I have ever had the miss fortune to read. I have found one use for it...as a monitor stand."
2,Great for project managers. Poor for developers.,"I was a little let down by this book because I wanted to get both an overview of Commerce Server and a bit more detail in the API. There simply aren't enough examples to articulate the writers' points. I'm learning that Commerce Server is much like chess -- it takes a few minutes to learn, and a lifetime to master. This book is supposed to guide its reader from design to coding and implementation as well as testing. Instead, it only handles design and very basic uncommon development scenarios.I feel this book would be better geared to a project manager or architect trying to learn how Commerce Server can be beneficial to an eCommerce project; however, I don't feel a developer can properly learn to use Commerce Server from this book."
2,please debug your code,sample store does not work.i don't have time to debug my own code let alone sample code from a book :)the book does give a good overview of commerce 2002 (unfortunally there's nothging to compate it to)where are you wrox !
3,Moderately Helpful,"This book has the advantage of being one of the few on CS2000+ to cover the .NET API and use .NET (C#) code examples, although it was mostly a conceptual, somewhat disjointed coverage of commerce topics and not the programming reference I'd hoped. It would have been more helpful to have seen a programming case study rather than little code ""vignettes"" that were shown in isolation, e.g., gift processing. One thing that surprised me was the lack of coverage of the .NET API for getting order information after it is saved in the system (see the BCL entry for ""PurchaseOrder"" in MS Help Docs). That said, this book was the primary reference for my porting a classic ASP 3.0 Commerce Site to CS2002..."
5,The revelation,"Martin Turnovsky's performance was the very first recording of any music by Martinu that I had ever heard. It was while I resided in Brooklyn, around 1980 and I believe I heard it on WQXR-FM, the fabled radio station of the New York Times. The Largo, the third movement of this work, nearly rendered me to tears. Imagine my joy when, over a decade later, I finally found a cd recording of this performance at the fabled Tower Records in DC. There are better performances of this incredible symphony, but Turnovsky's performance will always hold a special place in my heart."
2,These positive reviews are all fake!,"Obviously Chris Ott has signed in under all these different names to give his own book positive reviews If have have ever seen a fake name before, then certainly 'David Forsythe' is it!This book is totally derivitive and not worth buying. Whole paragraphs seem to be lifted from the Deborah Curtis book. Chris waxes on in a prose style not worthy of a freshman in college. I think he should go back to his failed indie rock band."
1,nothing here of interest,Chris Ott writes really pretentious reviews for the online 'zine Pitchfork -- this book reads like a haphazard collection of his none-too-deep thoughts. Mostly it's incoherent posturing. Not recommended.
1,so derision,this is the one book with the white pages the black print and the tiltle of an album it was also written in englase
1,pretentious junk,"I bought this book and I regret it -- there's no new information anywhere, just a lot of going on about nothing. As far as I can tell Ott is some failed musician who has made it his sad goal in life to add his absolutely meaningless commentary to a subject much bigger and more important than he will ever be."
3,not too many pictures,this is a book about there worst album. my favorit Joy Divison albums are script of the bridge and turn on the bright lights. i want to have ian curtis's baby.
4,Amazing... but buy a couple,"I absolutely love this brush. It is amazing, I use it every time I blow dry my hair. It's great for long or short hair. People always ask me about it. My only issue is that mine has broken a couple times. Maybe I have thick hair, or use it a lot, but I recommend buying a couple, they are onyl $1 each, and it's worth it since the shipping is so high. Overall, I love this brush and couldn't live with out it."
4,Off the well-beaten path of vampire literature,A Terrible Beauty is an interesting and thoughtful revision of the classic Beauty and the Beast tale. It's very well written and has fully developed characters and beautiful imagery. This is the type of writing to which other sci-fi/horror authors should aspire. It is a travesty that Baker's books are no longer in print.
3,not quite as good as her other vampire novels.,"If you like this, do yourself a favour and read Nancy Baker's other vampire novels... They are wonderful, while this one is merely interesting."
3,cute - but not washable,"very cute. a little bit large for an average child's head though, fits an adult head just fine - and not washable at all. Fun for a couple of uses but don't count on having it for too long."
2,not so great hat,"My boys, ages 3 and 5, LOVE the Disney Peter Pan movie. I thought they would enjoy this hat to play pretend Peter Pan, but they have not worn their hats since receiving them 5 days ago. The hats do not stay on their heads well at all."
4,Very good,"The discs are securely cased. Reproduction is very good, except for a bit of wavy introductory music on one disc. However, this does not affect the video. I consider the set a good purchase."
5,The return of Sherlock Holmes box set,"Fans of Sherlock Holmes, particularly Jeremy Brett as Holmes, will love this set. Brett seems to really have fun as Holmes in these episodes, and Edward Hardwicke as Watson replaces David Burke seamlessly. The locations and period costumes really seem like victorian London and all the episodes are beautifully filmed. Definitely five out of five stars."
5,Jeremy Brett is the best Sherlock Holmes EVER,"Jeremy Brett IS SHerlock Holmes, hands down. This was a gift for my Sister. She just loves Jeremy Brett and she was so surprised when I gave her this for Christmas. Wonderful. Shipped quickly. Love it."
4,Great shows - minor insufficiencies,My wife and I have been enjoying these episodes since we got the DVD collection. Each of the episodes is well done and clear. We truly enjoy each of these shows. The only dissapointment is that there are no subtitles. Subtitles are one of the things that I look forward to having on my DVD's as I have friends and relatives who benefit from them.
3,"Really, Holmes?","The DVDs of the ""Return of Sherlock Holmes"" are grand entertainment: the sets and costumes accurate for the period (and many of the sets very beautiful indeed), and all the portrayals accurate and credible. Conan Doyle would have been proud to see his stories presented this way.Two problems.Many of the adaptations seem to have been padded to make them extend to the time required for the TV presentations; there is a good deal in there that Conan Doyle never wrote. And I have to say (even if I'm the only one who does) that Brett's Holmes is a touch exciting - even hysterical - for the Holmes character. Too loud, too flamboyant, and not really the right face shape for the reserved, ascetic, thin detective of Conan Doyle's creation.Three stars. Sorry."
5,Plese release on DVD!!,Please release the early Martin Sheen classic on DVD in the not so distant future!Thanks!
2,Beware - directors cut,This is a director's cut version - looked like a good movie but I couldn't hear it over all the talking. Would much rather hear Costas talk than some writer/director.
5,Key ring holder.,"These are rugged, reliable, but easily detached key ring holders. They are high priced but work well. I use these for keeping various car keys on my main ring during woods work."
5,hot sauce,"The world's best hot sauce for Italian foods, a little goes a long, long way. Not easy to find in grocery stores."
5,excellent copy from VCI,"The VCI Entertainment DVD of Eagles Wing is excellent. I have had this movie on Beta and VHS copies off of TV, and the video quality was sub-par to most movies. I got a VHS studio copy from Good Times, and the video was so bad that I threw it away. So I didn't expect much from a little production company. I was surprised at the very high quality of the VCI DVD. I have many, many movies from the major studios that are not any where near as good as this DVD. Good work VCI."
4,Alright,"Good for close quarter work. The redirection moves are good to know if you find yourself at close range. I haven't seen this in any of the other DVDs that I've watched. However, I prefer the Cold Steel - ""Warriors Edge"" long range fight strategy where the primary focus is to avoid getting cut I the first place. Also, I'm not a great fan of the drills where you rapidly take turns in getting cut as I think it will lead the practitioner into a mutual slay.James Keating can be a little too esoteric in his instruction style but demonstrates a broad knowledge and experience. The man does know what he's talking about. The disarm techniques are good. However, I think there's a chance you will get cut on the arm but that's better than getting cut on the throat! There's some good tips on making a good cut, concealment and the attitude required to be a winner if you ever have to defend yourself using a knife. There's enough unique material in this set to make it worth the money."
3,Works but there are issues,"Kit works but the tool included was not the right size to loosen the top nut. Fortunately I had one from and earlier kit so I got the project done. The gaskets and ""o"" rings worked fine. Since it was less than half the price of the local chain home improvement store I'm satisfied."
2,Product not as pictured.,"Item is pictured as genuine delta single lever repair kit in a Delta blister pack. Item is not in a blister pack and comes in a small press seal bag. The typical Delta Combination Wrench and Allen Wrench is not supplied with this kit but the Delta Wrench is shown in the blister pack picture. A separate allen wrench and flat wrench is substituted for orginal Delta combination wrench. The substituted fla wrench does not work well for tightening. The springs supplied are also longer, making installation of rubber seals a problem. The supplied plastic ring for the faucet does not have the same smooth shiny finish as does the Genuine Delta Ring (the ring supplied does not appear as sturdy, is not smooth and has a dull finish). My conclusion: this is a cheap repair part made a company other than Delta. In the future I will buy the more expensive Genuine Delta Single Lever Faucet Parts at the local hardware.[...]"
1,VERY POOR BUSINESS,You sent a previous returned item that was poorly taped up. Real nice for a child to open at christmas.....Verry poor business PRACTICES....
5,Jessica is a Gift from God,"My favorite song from this album is ""I Can Mend Your Fences."" The words could have very well been written about my life. Jessica has an amazingly beautiful voice and her dedication to the Lord shines through in her music as well as in person. She has a way of connecting with people through the songs she sings."
5,High quality big band christmas music,"Personally I believe we should never expect something cheap coming from the Coca-Cola company; this 10-tracks 33-minutes music CD would be a perfect example of that. I don't know which year it was recorded but the sound quality of the recording is exceptional considering it's 40s-style music, and the music itself is truly excellent and moody. I'm usually not at all a fan of ""big band""-style music, I bought this CD cheaply at a 1$ store only because it had a Coca-Cola logo on it. Some tracks have lyrics and are true christmas classics like ""Let it snow"", others are in the same style but less ""Christmas"" or only instrumental. Overall I would really recommend this CD to everybody who want high-quality ""Broadway-style"" christmas music, especially at the price it's sold on Amazon."
4,Day Trader Review,One of the few books I have read dealing with the market that has been fun to read. It not only seems accuarte but it is done with excellent writing technique. Hope to see more from this author.
4,A Solace to thwarted,"At a time when the news about corporate frauds go ignored due to their frequency, and the governments across the world pour ever greater amount of public money to bail-out privately owned businesses, the line dividing private and public good has been rendered confusing. The crisis of credibility is becoming universal. People, who were at the cutting edge of anything, have appeared bleeding with cuts in recent days, be they tycoons of banking or publishing. So people are loosing their sense of surprise and absurd.In such times we need to read the books like THE DAY TRADER by David Lentz, in the hope that there are a few writers clever enough to see beyond the chaos, as they have a profound idea of what made the things to come to such a pass. The people intimidated and thwarted by big business interests will certainly appreciate, and possibly find a solace in this book.Krishna Bhattauthor"
4,Cult film with bizarre visuals-nothing more,"The film follows the mental journey of an addict as he checks himself into a drug rehab clinic in europe to overcome his dependence on drugs and alcohol. The film is basically one hallucination after another which may appeal to those who enjoy this sort of thing. The film is, in parts, fascinating to watch, especially the 'vampire' sequence. The appearance of Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs add to the 'sixties drug addict' feel of the film as well. Recommended to those who enjoy something different."
5,Watch it on LSD,"Excellent music by Ravi shankar and a very nonlinear, trippy filmmaking style coupled with the spiritual journey theme of an addict, definitely condusive to the psychedelic experience."
2,Strictly a rental.,"VHS tape was good quality, and the used price was a bargain...maybe. The film is a collage of different scenes tracking Rooks' journey to recovery. Lots of multiple exposures that are gratuitous, shots of Indian ceremonies that are not explained, and in fact that is the major flaw with this movie. ""What the hell is going on and what does it mean?"" We don't know because Rooks hams it up so much there isn't any time left for exposition. Barrault looks clueless and seems to be ad-libbing his role. On a more positive note, the sitar and jazz music is good. Will look for soundtrack, especially with Ornette Coleman's missing score. Nice shots of old New York and Paris, cameraman shooting over the motorcyclist shoulder is innovative for its time. Minor beatnik presence from a short cameo of Ginsberg and somelonger shots of a stiff and creaky Burroughs. The music is the best part of this movie."
2,Bad Trip,"I was ready for a wild ride of visual hallucinations according to other reviews and felt this film really came up short. I was enticed by the fact that Burroughs and Ginsberg made appearences but I'd call them cameos. Burroughs' character is boring and Ginsberg and boyfriend Peter are jamming in Central Park singing Shamalama Ding Dong for about 30 seconds. The mythology of Peyote is touched on with Native American narrative but, come on, must the story be acted out with a woman in a Maxi dress walking along the banks of a river? She is supposed to be the mother of a trancendant mystical magical mind guide drug and it comes off more like a Dippity Do TV ad from 1967. The music by Shankar is great. I will give the film that. I spent way too much money on this DVD. A classic by no means. Not anymore anyways. Save your money for a nickel bag."
5,Great Series!,I would recommend this anime series to anyone who loves anime. The characters are fun and the storylines are good!
4,"1,2,3,4","This album was basically recorded as a lark, when Dee Dee Ramone decided to record some old Ramones songs with himself on lead vocals. It actually turned out pretty good. The band plays the songs well, and Dee Dee sounds good on vocals, if not as good as Joey Ramone. On a few of the songs, Dee Dee lets his wife Barbara sing lead, and she sounds pretty good, too. She has a cute accent! Although most of the songs are old Ramones songs, there are a few songs that are not. ""Shakin' All Over"" is a Guess Who song, ""Motorbikin'"" is an original, ""Cathy's Clown"" is an Everly Brothers song, ""Fix Yourself Up"" is an original and ""Sidewalk Surfin'"" is an original (it's not the Jan and Dean song). This is a fun album that most of Dee Dee's fans should enjoy."
3,"Dee Dee Ramone is so wonderful, but the drummer kills the record!","Dee Dee, Barbara and the cameo by Spedding are all great.The cover versions are sub-standard.The drummer (Chase Manhattan?) KILLS the record and make it impossible to listen to with the VERY annoying phantom stare drum beat.Daniel Rey is VERY missed in the production.It sounds like Dee Dee signing backed-up by a bunch of teenagers (both on the instruments and control room).You can tell the man was in need of some cash to throw something like that on the market.Want a Dee Dee solo album? Get yourself ""I hate freaks like you"" or ""Zonked!""I cannot stress how bad the drummer is. He shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a drum kit. He's a total disgrace. He really KILLS the record, by the way.Oh, before I forget, the drummer is really horrible."
1,1234 Cretins don't wanna rock no more.,C'mon this is awful. How many times can Dee Dee cover the old Ramones catalogue? Any creativity had left him by this point.Barbara cant sing either. Utterly pointless just like the Ramainz live thing.Sad epitaph for one of the greats.
1,Still have not received after a month.,"I still have not received this set after placing the order over a month ago. Unfortunatley, my sons 9th birthday was two weeks ago and he continues to check daily."
2,decent for the price,we used about 40 of these and then switched to Lucifer Lighting. Halo tends to burn bulbs and the trim is poor.
2,Beware of expensive trim,"I installed these cans because I liked the small size and ease of installation. However, when I went to purchase the trim the cost per each piece was over 50% of the cost of the actual can light. I would have rather gone with a standard six inch can and been able to purchase the trim at $5 each as opposed to almost $12 each. Just something to consider before installing throughout your home as I did."
3,Very good examples--horrible code,"In general the book was good. The text was well written, the examples were practical, and the simulations were informative. (4 to 5 stars). However, the code was rough which made the logic flow very difficult to understand. Furthermore, it made the models very inflexible. I had to rewrite virtually everything ( 1to 2 stars)."
4,A good place to start,"If you want to know more about Karaism, what Karaites believe, and have believed, etc., this is a good place to start. The book is systematic. It starts with Karaite history (starting with ancient Jewish history), then proceeds to cover Karaite thought, belief, and practice. It seems a little sparse on some of the details for the holidays (mostly for Yom Teruah - aka Rosh HaShannah, and Yom Kippur), but other than that it is pretty thorough."
4,Brief but complete!,"This book, as its title shows, is a brief material about Karaite Judaism; its just an introduction. The person that is looking for basic information concerning this Jewish denomination can find in this work his/her perfect guide.Este libro, como muestra su título, es un material breve sobre el Judaísmo Caraíta, es sólo una introducción. La persona que busca información básica sobre esta denominación judía puede encontrar en esta obra su guía perfecta."
5,Very Useful,"I got this book at a discount table and almost put it down when I realized it was geared toward office professionals ( I work in social services) and I am so glad I decided to risk it. The scenarios she uses, as well as the tips she gives, fit for all sorts of people in a variety of fields. The book is well written and easy to read and understand."
3,"Interesting subject matter, innovative perspective, but hard to read","I agree, this book presents an interesting reinterpretation of Malthus and his theories.. and the use of case studies is really good. But the writing is dry, and I found it extremely difficult to get through.. but once you do the conceptual background is very intriguing."
2,A critique of Malthusian thinking on capitalist development.,"Synopsis from Amazon.co.uk -- This volume represents a major critique of the way Malthusian thinking has influenced capitalist development policy in the modern period, as well as in the past. It highlights the strategic role of Malthusian ideas in the defence of capitalist political economy when confronted by struggles for equality and human progress."
4,Good prepared properly,"These are wheat gluten steaks, pretty good with onions and gravy, or great sliced into strips and used in stir-fry."
5,PRETTY GOOD,THESE ARE PRETTY GOOD AS FAR AS GLUTEN BASED FAKE MEATS GO. I PUT THEM IN STIR FRY AND EAT AS A QUICK SNACK. MY DOGS LOVE THEM AS A TREAT. I WISH THEY WOULD REMOVE THE SMALL AMOUNT OF MSG IN THEM HOWEVER.
3,Good in stir-fry,"These are seitan-ish strips of un-Pollanesque wheat gluten. I found them to be decent when chopped and stir fried into mixed vegetables, and you could reduce the broth to gravy."
3,It;s a substitute!,"Odd rubbery texture, smells a little like cheap dog food, but if you cook it with enough seasonings and aromatics it becomes much more palatable. I porbably would not buy it again."
2,Better Options for the History,"Difficult read in many respects. Use of grammar by the author very dated. You would have hoped that later revisions would have consolidated and distilled this verbose presentation. John Bright's writing style makes the book a taxing read. If there was a charge for comma's, run on sentences, and fragments, this book would cost thousands! The research and scholarship is quite good but sorry I made this purchase! I will look more closely at the previews next time...."
1,Probably not the original,"Perfume lasted for only the first three sprays, I guess they mixed something else 'cos I've been using this perfume for years and the smell remains strong till the last drop - well not for this bottle.Lesson learned - Stick to buying perfumes from reputable retailers or better still the duty free shops."
2,Wish it would have worked more than 10 uses,"I loved my GF Grill since I'm not allowed to have a grill on my patio (nor do I have an option of outdoor grilling space) - so I bought this large edition and loved the cooking results. Living alone though, I didn't use it as often as I would had I been cooking for more people. I used it about 10 times total over a couple of years' time and lo-and-behold, it quit working as I saw in someone else's review.I used it to make a pork loin (which it does fabulously), unplugged it and went to use it a couple of days later to find it just decided that was its last meal... and of course, no more warranty with the 1 yr it comes with. :("
3,Not the best Foreman grill,"I have owned a couple of the Foreman grills and although this is the largest, it is definitely not my favorite. It cooks great but the plates are not removeable so it makes cleaning it very difficult and messy. It now resides in the back of my pantry."
4,Great Product,"I was told this grill did not have as hot a heating service as the original foreman. I disagree. Great grill, huge and perfect for cooking for 3 or more."
2,Too bulky,It is probably fine if you have alot of counter space or cabinet space. It is just too bulky for my kitchen. I gave it away but they haven't used it either.
2,Disappointed...expecting a stainless steel grill.,"I thought from the picture this was going to be a stainless steel grill, but it has a painted gray (matte) finish. It doesn't seem at all sturdy either. The plates are not removable, which is a big minus. I can't tell you how well it works because I am going to give it away as a Christmas present. The only good thing is I didn't have to pay full price for it.FYI: Wolfgang Puck has a much nicer, heavy duty grill for about the same price. It has a removable plate with a grill and griddle side (dishwasher safe)."
4,Unable to fully review,"I am assuming the product stands by it's name. It was a gift,so I really can not review it."
1,Avoid the George Forman GRV160S,"We received this as a gift for Christmas. Although it did a good job cooking, after 10 uses it no longer worked. In addition it was very hard to clean and had a strange odor, even after it was cleaned."
3,too big,I made a mistake buying this item. Too big & bulky to be kept in the kitchen.Have not used it yet so cannot rate its performance.Will probably pass it on & buy the smaller one when I see one on sale.
3,Solid grill-but mine stopped working after 6 weeks,"Awesome grill but it stopped turning on after 6 weeks of light use. No problem though, Toastmaster (company that owns the George Foreman Brand) was awesome and fixed it under warranty. Even sent me return label online.Huge grill, I think I just was unlucky."
2,Disappointed in George,We have a smaller George Foreman grill which we like very much. Its components go right into the dishwasher and it is entirely smoke free. The same cannot be said for the larger model. The heating sections are not removable and it smokes--considerably. We have relegated it to the garage and gone back to the smaller model.
2,A good idea gone south,"The cover or lid should be polishd steel. Instead it is a dull or matte finish. An on-off is lacking, and, finally, the heating plate has hot and warm spots -- hence the cooking is uneven. It is a Foreman Grill and with little effort and cost to the manufacturer this piece of equiptment could have been very useful"
4,Good Grill for a GREAT price...,"I got this on the Amazon 06 xmas Customer Vote promo, so I got a killer deal! This grill could burn everything and it would still be worth the price I paid! I've only used it once so far (it's a LOT bigger than I thought it would be), and it worked great, for some burgers, but it was not as easy to clean up as the commercials said it would be. But still not bad overall. Great product when it's too cold or just not convenient to go out to the grill..."
4,Foreman Jumbo Grill Review,"I received the grill with the leg next to the power cord broken off. I decided to epoxy it back on rather than return it. Have used it many, many times, and it is truly amazing in a positive way. I cook two huge salmon steakes at the same time, and they are done to perfection in 3 1/2 minutes. Other than the poor quality control of sending out a machine that was obviously damaged, the machine itself works great, and I am quite happy with it."
5,A story that should make every Indian ashamed and proud,"One of the best movies from India. Seema Biswas' acting is incomparable. This true story should shame all apathetic Indians. It also gives them a chance to pride in Indian democracy - regardless of how flawed, corrupt and dynastic it is. In which other poor country would someone like Phoolan Devi be able to become a member of Parliament. Brutality occurs everywhere - in Darfur, in Pakistan ( Mukhtaran Mayee) , but it is only a democracy such as India that can give some semblance of hope to the oppressed. Hail Phoolan Devi."
2,Slow moving at best...,"This movie would be 100% better if it wasn't so L-O-N-G...In the beginning its 15 mins of watching the garbage truck pull into the recycling area, and it just DRAGS on. My 4 year old son liked it at first, but I find he hits the rewind button over and over - perhaps in hopes of it doing something else. Not the best movie I've purchased for him and I am glad that I didn't spend the money on the three pack !!!"
5,Who knew landfills could be so much fun?,"We got all three dvds in this series for our nephew (2) because, like a lot of boys around his age, he seems obsessed with large industrial vehicles. He watched these dvds in something like a trance. There are educational elements cleverly slipped into the action, but mostly it's trucks doing all kinds of cool, trucky things I didn't even know about."
5,Best Christian writing since The Bible,When author David Sereda tells of his encounter w Jesus Christ it rang true in my heart of my walk w The Lord. Compassion and working a space in your heart and soul where externals do not enter is NOT a popular sell. Sadly even for most Christians.This book will help me clearly focus on becoming a more compassionate loving soul. Not just in prayer or meditation but in daily life w whom so ever...Greater is his challenge to take your workspace of compassion and love and freely give it to others and place it on all those externals we as Christians didn't apply in healing our own hearts.I sincerely Thank David Sereda for writing his account knowing he would suffer scoffing for doing so. If it helps David's book got at least one soul closer to Christ
1,"Science, not religion, please...","What a disappointment to come across this chronicle of a religious delusion by such a bright and promising ufologist.The Case for NASA UFOS dvd was awe inspiring, and David's analysis and passionate emphasis on the reality of ufos is excellent. I was a bit shocked to see that he wrote this book premised upon the visitation of a non-existent fictional person such as ""Jesus Christ"", who symbolizes the binding of earth humans to the wheel of ignorance and superstitious belief. I recommend that everyone read ""Star Wisdom"" by Gene Andrade for a primer, ""The Talmud of Immanuel"" concerning the earthly prophet Immanuel who's mission here was fictionalized and distorted and falsely represented in the contrived ""Jesus Christ"" myth, and to further investigate the ""Meier Contacts"" for more specific information and solid evidence ([...])."
3,"Pricey For A Cheap Product, But It Can Be Fun","This bean bag toss has been used by my sixth graders for several years. It is cheaply made, but somehow it has managed to not fall apart over the years. My two daughters also enjoy playing the simple game. It came with three small bean bags (three orange and three red), but one of the bean bags started to get a small hole and soon after became a bag with no beans. I do feel the $11 price tag is a little high."
2,okay,"The bean bags are very small. The plastic target is not sturdy. The toy serves its purpose, but won't last long."
3,Daníel Ágúst - If You Leave Me Now,"IF YOU LEAVE ME NOW, Daniel Agust's debut EP after leaving the Icelandic Gus Gus consortium, features his earnest vocals over an abstracted neo-classical backdrop. The b-side, ""Someone Who Swallowed a Star,"" is similarly accompanied by a string quartet, albeit with some gurgling electronics underneath."
5,Amazon - Get it straight! You are misleading the kids!,"Just for information, the first flight was NOT in 1904! Amazon - shame on you! DECEMBER 17, 1903 was that eventful day."
5,Best Set of Tools For The Job,"There is nothing more important during an engine rebuild than making sure that the block is 100% clean of debris and machining residue. This set of brushes covered every area of the block, from the cylinders to the lifter bores to the oil galleys and everywhere in-between. I cut the loop end off of the large cylinder bore brush and chucked it up in an electric hand drill to really scrub down the cylinder walls. Worked like a dream. The long handled brushes were great and able to reach all the way through block to completely clean out the oil galleys. These brushes are money very well spent."
4,The Nude Figure,"I am an art student and just recently got this book, I find it superb. The black and white pictures have a sort of romantic quality. I loved the varying poses taken by the models, quick and dynamic in quality. But there was one drawback, some of the pictures were dark and moody, but regardless of this fact I would highly recommend this book."
4,charcoal and pencil work best,"this book was rather helpful to me, yes some picture quality is not perfect, and could be crisper, but it gives some helpful ideas on future projects. Most of the poses in here are not the most comfortable to hold in a sitting for a drawing, so this book is a decient refrence, pictures could be a bit bigger with more veloptuous models. many of these girls are rail thin and need to eat. and very few but appreciated pregnant photos. Overall though i think this book is a good start and will be used wisely"
2,Good poses but...,just a bad publication. I wish the image quality was better; if so this would be a really good book.
4,"Even better than ""The Figure In Motion""!","I bought this book when it first came out a few years ago, and I have to say it both does even better than its predecessor, ""The Figure In Motion"", and takes it a step further with the quality of its artistic reference; I have done several drawings using the photos from this book, and the people I showed them to were impressed, to say the least. My only real complaint about ""The Nude Figure"" is that all of the nude models in the photos should have been women, as I prefer drawing female nudes over males; otherwise, this is a great reference book, and I can't wait for Mark E. Smith to come out with a third such book (only next time, featuring all female models, maybe with a bit more range in age and physical type) in the future. I'd recommend it!"
2,I expected more,"I was quite disappointed with the quality of the pictures in this book. They were very grainy, some without much contrast. As far as the poses go, there were only a handful that 'worked' in terms of composition. Also the models tended to be too similar in size, shape, and ethnicity. The point of figure drawing is to develop skills to draw ALL shapes and sizes!There are other books on figure drawing that are much better in terms of skill development but I am still looking for a good book of photos to draw from. However, this one is not it."
3,Only ordinary,"The one thing this book contributes is variety, at least a little. As pointed out elsewhere, the models are all young. Still, there are a few different men and women with interesting differences between them. The fact of having a pregnant model at all is distinctive - pregnancy could be a topic for a whole pose book itself. Blacks, Asians, New World faces and others are also conspicuous by their absence, but that's true of most other pose books as well.This book has some value, but isn't the hardest-working book on the shelf."
1,Not for artists looking for poses!,"The author of the book said he wanted to go for aesthetically pleasing, but figured artists wanted more on visibility. He would've done so much better going with his first choice! I wanted a good book of poses, and have yet to get one picture out of the book! Most of the poses in this book weren't pleasing to the eye at all. The models are all young, thin people in ridiculous, often painful looking poses. A little variety would've been great, too, and the two photos of pregnant women in there don't count for much. There are no old people, fat people, or even normal sized people! There are, however, an archive of the worst poses I've seen to date. Do yourself a favor and go get a good book like Anatomy for the Artist by Sarah Simblet or Virtual Pose 2 by Mario Henri Chakkour. You'll actually get some use out of them."
2,Where do they come up with this stuff?,"I was looking for a book with some good posing of just a natural figure for some sculpting and art work. The cover of this book looks like what i was looking for. When I opened the book i found several body types(some were older and some rather bony which wasn't so good) and very poor posing. There are both men and women in this book, however, some of the poses are so ridiculous that i have no clue how they could be used for anything constructive. I find about half the book useful. The other half is grainy photography and crazy ""what are they doing?"" poses. I must say that I still have not found exactly what i am looking for in one single book. And this one, i know isn't it."
1,Lacking in the basics,"As with most pose books, there is a severe lack of detail and contrast in the photos. The purpose of this book is to provide an alternative to life drawing, but fails in the very aspect of life drawing that makes it so effective. With such poor photography, it is extremely difficult to discern the surface features that are so important to learning artistic human anatomy. While the poses have a slightly more natural bend than most books in this genre, there is still an unnatural stiffness, or exaggeration of movement that is rarely every desired in figure references. In addition, all of the models are young college age people, with little or no ethnic diversity.The overall direction of this book attempts to provide the artist with a holistic smattering of references in anatomy, movement and lighting, but fails in all three catagories, badly. I don't recommend this book to anyone with serious ambitions in learning to draw the human figure."
5,Great Collection of Articles,"This new Fifth Edition of The ARRL Satellite Anthology brings you the best articles on the current (and future!) amateur spacecraft from QST, The AMSAT Journal, the World Wide Web and other sources.This edition also includes recent satellite columns from RadCom, Radio ZS and Amateur Radio (Australia).With several new amateur satellites now in orbit, and more in the planning stages, you'll want to ""read all about them""-and this book is the best way to do just that.Chapters cover:History/ IntroductionPhase 3D and AMSAT-OSCAR 1Radio Sputnik (RS)MicrosatsUniversity Small Satellite ProjectsMir/Space Shuttle/International Space StationFuture Satellites""Amateur Satellites"" and Other Satellite ColumnsSoftware/Tracking/SuppliersWhether you're an experienced satellite communicator or you're just getting started, you'll enjoy the wide variety of articles this book provides."
2,Product not sturdy,Would not recommend this for an active drum circle. It survived only one drum circle event. Would have rather spent a few dollars more for a better made product as we drum regularly. Not recommended for young children.
5,Table and guest chairs for a princess and her princess friends,"Our little princess is about to outgrow them and not only physically but she had a lot of fun with them for a couple of years. Like many girls her age, she was very much into Disney princesses as a preschooler so having her favorite characters pictured on the table and on the little chairs was a big thing. Many dozens of princess lunches and other private princess parties later over the past couple of years or so, the set looks as good as new and we expect to make good money (just kidding) this coming spring at the planned garage sale.As far as I remember, the assembly was a matter of minutes. The set we received had no defects or blemishes and we are happy with the purchase. As the other review pointed out, what you get is not teak or any kind of solid wood. It's cheap materials but, so far, they proved to be quite durable."
3,Ehh. . . It's press board. . . you get what you pay for,"I own this table and it fell over on hard wood floors and chipped off a chunk of the table, but I guess you get what you pay for!!Cheap, cute, just not very durable."
5,Great rendition of Islamey,I bought this recording specifically for Balakirev's Islamey and it does not disappoint! I have other recordings of the Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev pieces. After 3 months of ownership I haven't listened to the two concerti yet. The Islamy is something special though.Enjoy!
5,locking lug nuts,I was very happy with the quality of these lugs. I just got new wheels and tires and wanted them to be as secure as I could make them. They look great and are just perfect for my 91 ford ranger 4x4. Shipping was very fast. This is because I live in the same state. Would difinatly purchase this brand again
2,poor quality control,Recieved in a timley manner but three out of the 20 lug nuts do not fit the locking key. Very poor quality control or whom ever shipped the item was dooped by a previous customer when the nuts were returned. I'll think twice before ordering another item from this Web Site.
1,Guilty as charged,"This game features synopsis of cases from around the world and asks you to state whether the judge found for or against one of the parties. Some of the cards mention which country the case took place in, some don't. Some cards mention what year the case took place, some don't. And the answers don't explain why the judge found a certain way. So unless you are a legal trivia buff and know all laws in all countries in all periods of history, it just turns into a guessing game."
3,Challenge,We found this game to be challenge between common knowledge of laws and fully knowing official laws. Some cases may not be appropriate for chilren watch carefully. We still had a splended time. Enjoy your debate.
2,Boring!,"Sorry to have to say it but this game was dull. The questions that were asked were interesting, I suppose, but as far as fun is concerned...look elsewhere. It's not a party game so my husband and I played it together and still thought it was boring. Great Concept but it didn't fly."
2,A Fine Work of Self-Promotion,"I don't want to seem too negative about this book because I am a Bears fan, and a McMichael fan as well, but I was dissapointed. I was expecting to read about the Superbowl season of 1985 from the point of view of someone who was there. Maybe read a couple of locker room stories that hadn't been told to the public before. But there really wasn't much substance to this book, unless you count the numerous references to McMichael's stats, and how great he thinks he was. Mongo, we know you were a great player, but it's sad to have you remind us of it ever other paragraph.So if you'd like an easy read, with a general overview of McMichael's career, this is a decent book. But if you are a true Bear's fan, don't expect to learn anything new."
4,"I wish two or three inches more, but very good.","Simply what I needed for my swimming days. The detail of the size is not an obstacle to get it and enjoy it.And I'm showing every body why I'm improving on technique, without a single word."
5,Exactly right!,"This link: http://www.thebbqdepot.com/grma.html provides a good cross-check of grill model and part number for burners and other grill parts. I used it to find the part number, and amazon listed the best price. Part was exactly as original, replaced by simply sliding into place. Be careful removing the old, worn burners, though. They are secured in place by a steel spring clip under the rear mounting pin (you'll see it on the new part) and it's easy to cut yoursef on the old rusty burner while trying to pry the clips out."
2,Burner does not fit 141.16681 grill,"This burner does not fit the 141.16681 grill as it says in the listing. Be sure to measure your old burners and make sure it is the right size. They did accept the return without any issues. They were very nice, just be sure to measure before you buy. It looks right but most of Sears BBQ's that use these burners are supposed to be 14"" long."
1,Too short,"The overall length was about 2 inches too short, and the sleeve does not cover the propane outlet. I needed kenmore part number P02001004E, which this says it will fit, and it DOES drop in place, but the burner area is about 2 inches too short to match the original burners."
3,Nice burner a bit small,I purchased these for a Kenmore Grill 141.16681. These burners look the same and work fine with a modification. Since they are shorter then the stock burners that came with the unit and the mounting surface in the rear of the grill was rusted anyway. I have remade and repostioned the mounting area. So they have worked out just fine for me.It is a 50%+ savings over ordering them new from Sears so was worth the extra work since it needed some TLC anyway. Used grill got a nice 460-470 degrees with all 4 burners going.
3,customer,My fighten skill for self defense is not that good wanted to improve it. But these video is made for people that want to become a wrestler. Maybe just bought the wrong product.
4,Long live rock'n'roll!,"With their release of ""Play Some Rock & Roll!"" Mambo Sons show that the art of rock & roll is still alive and well. They have their own ideas but at the same time they respect tradition and that is very important. Tight band, great guitar work, beautiful vocal harmonies and interesting compositions make this CD very enjoyable."
5,What are you talking about!,"I don't know what sort of stuff is running through your heads, but movie was awesome!!! And just so ya know, IT WAS RAP!!! It's just people keep calling it pop!!! So burn it through yourthick heads that if it was crap like you said it is then network producers wouldn't put it on TV!!!!!!!! And I just realized something... YOU'RE NOT NETWORK PRODUCERS!!!"
1,What the h**l is this?,"I saw this on Cartoon Network over the holidays. I have no idea what these people were thinking. This special is up there with ""Frosty Returns"". Overall, it's garabge."
4,Boys will enjoy,"My 4 year old son just can't get enough of Trucks! Zimmo rides along with a truck driver and learns about all the different jobs that trucks do. The video also covers farming and tractors, bread making (a little off the title's subject, but interesting anyhow) and product delivery. Zimmo's voice can be irritating for the grownup, but boys seem to enjoy the action and educational aspects of this series, which includes spelling out of words and Fun Facts (includes statistics and other stuff which I didn't know). My son has memorized much of the audio portions, including 18 wheeler humor which he proudly recites to any willing adult! I would recommend, even for younger children."
3,Mildly disappointing,"This Kenny G holiday CD is not up to his normal high standards. First of all, there is only 38 minutes of music on this one, including an unnecessary rehash of Auld Lang Syne.Some holiday songs, like Deck the Halls and Frosty the Snowman, aren't meant to be jazzed up.This CD feels like a ""I don't have much new material to put on a new holiday CD, but my contract says I have to"" CD.Nonetheless, I still remain a big fan of Kenny G."
2,How Inappropriate!,"While most of this CD is typical Kenny G, the final song, Auld Lang Syne (Freedom Mix), is one of the most inappropriate songs that I have ever heard on a Christmas Album. Please tell me why, after listening to some beautiful Christmas jazz music, I would want to expose my family or friends to sound clips of Ellen DeGeneres stating her sexual preference, or an ex-president of the United States claiming ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman."" Kenny G is certainly a talented musician, but I have lost a lot of respect for him with his choice of sound clips selected for this Christmas CD. I will not recommend this CD to my friends."
3,Spicy but lacking,This is a good spicy sauce but for me the taste was more like a hot BBQ sauce. Its thick and sweet with an odd taste but not bad. It might go better with steak and wings than it would on eggs and potatoes.
3,they're ok,"I ordered 4 of these. First of all, they're very very dark, pretty much black unless direct sunlight is hitting them. My dining room table is more of a dark cherry, so they don't match but oh well. They took quite some time to assemble, and 2 of them cracked on the sides when we were tightening the bolts. You can still sit on them and everything (although if someone very overweight was sitting on one I might be worried), but obviously they're not the sturdiest chairs. They were so inexpensive that's to be expected I supposed."
3,They are cheap.,"They are cheap and they get water off the windshield.I live in Florida and we get rain often and twice on both blades I have had to slide the wiper blade back into it's carrier. No big deal, they are too large to fly off unless you leave them unattended for too long. They slide out slowly so when it stops raining you just push them back in. Annoying but again, they are cheap and they do keep water off the windshield."
5,"Five stars, could be less ??","A big five stars rating for this book, another one of the Kodak Workshop Series. This one covers the choice and the use for each kind of lens for a 35 mm camera. The book is, like all the others of the series, well written, clear, and with a lot of technical data about each kind of lens. When I begun my work as a professional photographer I've used this book a lot, and still now, I use it sometimes. So: perfect for the beginner or the advanced amateur and worth a reading for each pro."
3,Mixed feelings,"Love Eric but there's something missing from this production. Maybe I was expecting too much but this show is under an hour and the ""acoustic"" performances include Eric on piano.Granted the Austin City Limits DVD is roughly an hour but I'll grab it for my Eric fix."
4,EJ's new DVD,Eric Johnson live in Anaheim is a nice video if you could not be at the show. I bought the new Jeff Beck CD 'Appearing this week at Ronnie Scotts' at the same time. As astounding as EJ is he sounds like a child next to Mr. Beck. I liked Eric's Austin City Limits DVD better.
3,OK but not exciting..........,"I love EJ's big 3 releases: Tones, Ah Via Musicom, and Venus Isle. Also have others but nothing has ever equaled those three, including what I've recorded of him playing on TV over the years. He's been one of my fav electric players for years, partly because it's hard for me to play like him (why try, right?!).This disc is OK but lacks much excitment.......kinda ""ho, hum"" to watch. Nice that he's interviewed but he rambles too much as though he's tired or can't quite think of anything very significant to say.One way the disc might have been more interesting was if Eric (or someone) revealed, and it could be just a voiceover in post production, exactly what equipment he is going through on each song.I hope someday Eric releases another CD in the vein of those great three with some singable numbers and some great straight ahead, but not bluesy or jazzy, rock guitar."
5,Anamazing!,"I started playing guitar over forty years ago, so my appreciation of other musicians comes not only from enjoying what I hear but from an understanding of the complex subtleties involved in outstanding musical performances. In ""Anaheim Live"", Eric Johnson brilliantly demonstrates yet once again, why he is a master of his craft and is well-deserving of every accolade he receives. Every fan of E.J. should immediately add this dvd to his or her collection. I will watch it again and again and again..."
4,EJ - ANAHEIM DVD,Loved the video and it never gets old seeing EJ wail on his guitar. Highly recommend the video...only complaint...TOO SHORT!
5,Eric Johnson the tone king,"The tone king has given me another opportunity to listen to and watch his technique, frame by frame. Eric Johnson's Anaheim DVD captures both and I love slap harmonics! Camera angles gave me a close up view I can't see from the rail and shots of Tommy Taylor's drumming and Chris Maresh's bass added even more excitement. But it's the music that will captivate you as it did me. Buy it for Rocktapus alone as you may not hear it live as often as you will like."
5,Spectacular Universe,Incredible photos of the universe from Hubble and other large telescopes. Makes you consider how insignificant we are in the scheme of things on the one hand and the size of our magnificent universe which we inhabit on the other. This book contains some of the most incredible astronomical photographs ever published anywhere in my opinion.
5,Wonderful for Children,I happened upon this show while at home one day. I thought that the show would be wonderful for my 8 yr old granddaughter. I am still looking for the video to purchase.
3,WARNING! Scary scene for younger viewers...,"You can read the other reviews and get the storyline; what I wish I had known before I bought this movie is that there is a fairly graphic, bloody scene in which Nico's mother, the little boy's beloved pony, is killed by a mountain lion. My 5-year old, senstive, animal-loving daughter watched this movie a month ago and is still haunted, to the point of tears, day and night, by memories of this scene... As a parent, I feel very guilty for not prescreening this movie before showing it to my daughter - but I never imagined such an awful scene in a children's movie. She still enjoys the story and wants to watch the movie, oddly enough, but we have to fast-forward past a large section of it every time."
4,Very good information.,"This book was filled with a lot of information. Even though i'm not currently sticking to the ""program"", I found out a lot of information that I could share with others who are trying to get into a healthy life-style. If I ever get sick of being so over-weight, then I would find this book very useful. The only thing it did not do was make me realize how much I need to lose weight. But that isn't the book's fault. It's mine because nobody can get it thru my head that if I don't lose weight, I could have very bad health problems later on."
5,Well Done!,"By jove I think he's got it. this is really quite good. I was not sure what to expect. I really liked Dr. Phil's The Ultimate Weight Solution and thought that it was a great idea when his son quickly followed with one about teen's obsession with weight. Jay explains how the pressures and changes that are part and parcel to getting older take their toll on the teenage body. Fat piles on much quicker, or maybe for the first time, during your teeanage years.I bought this book with my daughter in mind and I am really happy with the results that I am already seeing. She has been reading it for a few days and she said that she agrees with a lot of what he says. I think it was a great idea to approach this very touchy subject with a young voice like Jay's."
2,The book was a joke,The book was complete joke to be honest. Loseing weight is really all about mind set this guys feeds you krap about this and that. Don't bother reading it
5,Pleasant Surprise,"Thought the book was too easy a read for the teen I purchased it for, but finding that to be a plus instead of a minus. Teen seems to be relating to the book and we've even had discussions after some of the chapters. Book seems to be providing ""food for thought""...pun intended."
2,never really read it.,Bought this for my younger sister. she asked for it. She never really read itI am sure this book is like most diet books out there
4,EMO HARDCORE,this cd is very interesting... they have the vocal power of Thursday and Found Dead Hanging COMBINED. They go from melodic emo singing to extreme hardcore breakdowns... very intrigueing... listen for yourself
5,Stunning,"Ok, I saw these guys live with Dead poetic which is another awsome hardcore band and they were just unbelieveable live and i must say this is an albaum to have if you like hardcore"
4,An Excellent Gift for Any Angler,"Be prepared for belly laughs. The fishermen get stuck in branches, get caught on their own hooks, catch a snake instead of a fish, see their cars roll away, get soaked several times, play practical jokes on each other (including a man disguised as a woman), etc. There are also some stars who do fishing, including Jerry Reed of SHE GOT THE GOLDMINE, I GOT THE SHAFT fame."
2,So-So,"The first 10 minutes are the best, the rest of it isnt that great and rather boring. I expected 40 minutes of hilarious outtakes, got 10 minutes of outtakes and 30 minutes of boring commentary by guest fishermen."
1,My husband didn't like it,He said that it is mostly filled with advertisements for boats and fishing equipment and rambling talking by his director.
4,Heart Wrenching,"Volume 3 of Air TV speaks to my heart. As the mother of a much-loved adopted daughter, the scenes where the biological father and the adoptive mother struggle over Misuzu is heart wrenching. Very emotional, very beautiful."
3,it could be better,Our Bible study was expecting something a bit different and better than this. There just isn't that much to it. All we are getting out of it is a reassurance that our lives are out of balance but that is about it. There is some scripture but it doesn't always seem to go along with what the chapter is about.The book has been good in the sense that it does bring us together each week and we do focus on some aspect of the Bible.
5,Beeswax Leather,"So thrilled with this purchase. By far the best finish for these shoes, the more of a beating they take, the better they look.Mine fit very true to size, I returned an earlier pair because i sized down. My advice is to go with your standard size. Heels are rather high and not as wide as I would like.They break in so comfortably.."
4,Sizing issue,"I love these shoes on my husband, but the ones he is wearing are falling apart. They are so old, I could no longer read the size (I actually couldn't find the size anywhere). He usually wears a size 9.5, so that is the size I ordered. Too big. I then ordered the 9s. Too big. I just placed an order for 8.5 and I will let you know."
3,Too loose- lautrec,"Grew up wearing Clarks desert boots, but that was two lifetimes ago. These are lower cut and easy to collapse and roll on your ankle. I even tried adding an additional eyelet but they just aren't working out. I'd love to get half price for them."
1,WAY TOO BIG!,It is absolutely ridiculous how out of size these shoes are. They are atleast 2 sizes bigger than a normal set of shoes. I reordered a size smaller but didnt work. When I went to order the size I thought were correct Amazon would not allow me to do so. The price has increased from $84 to $111....RIDICULOUS!
2,Snake Deadly act,"Just another chop sokey film to add to your collection!This is srictly for the dudes & gals that love the 70's Bruce Lee era which after he died many movie companies were trying to cash in on this Kung Fu Craze which most were corney,stupid,unreal but as time went by these films became more of a memory & something different to watch! A lot of these films have chinese music in the background & some have music like the soul movies of the 70's.So make some tea & order some chinese & watch this flick! Its got Angela Mao the girl that played Bruces sister in Enter the Dragon! Enjoy all you fans of 70's kung fu era!"
3,"old ""skool"" kung fu","In my opinion this flick is about average. Grossly overated!! Still worth watching the ""LOBSTER STYLE"",,weired, but very entertaining for real!!"
2,Not as I had expected,"Not what I had expected. Or at least, what I had hoped. Illustrations weren't all that interesting to me. A story of how to talk to children about the use of marijuana. I get the groovy, 70s child, hippie viewpoint, but it did not sway me to endorse that method of education. Already shipped back for a refund."
1,Attempt at brainwashing them young..,"this book is nothing more than an attempt to convince young children that there is simply nothing wrong with marijuana - when in fact the opposite is true.If indeed it's medicinal value was so important, many a drug manufacturer would have harvested it's enzymes and produced a marketable case for it's use. Instead, attempts at brainwashing our youth such as this exist to confuse, and make less threatening a vice-promoting plant which ruins more lives than it helps."
3,Interesting,This is very well written. It is a good book to introduce to your children. It does not glorify Marijuana. It give facts and it does promote responsibility.
4,still havent gotten mine?,i love this book but i bought it on feb 21 and its march 2 and still hasnt been shipped. ??
2,Why $355,I like this plane but I paid $29.00 why is this $355 here? I really like this toy but I rated low stars on everything because it is OVERPRICED.
4,Hella YES!,"These lights are awesome. Please see my install on a BMW R1200GS[...]My only problem with them was the instructions for wiring could be upgraded a bit for graphics. For a non-electrically educated biker, better instal instructions would have sped up the install by about 3 hours.Then, the relay switch that came with the lights was broken and I didn't know it so I was pulling my hair out thinking it was my wiring...I had an extra relay from an old car sitting in a drawer and tried it and it worked! DONE!Just a flook. Hella sent me a new one overnight after one phone call. Replaced it. All working.My experience of having the lights is I can be seen easily day and night by car drivers and feel safer on teh road for it. At night I can see at least 50% farther than the stock headlight which is safer for me too.Get these lights. See and be seen!"
5,Great Cartoon Movie,"I purchase this movie because I had seen it when it first came out many years ago and really enjoyed it. Kids will love it as well as adults and is based on the stand up comedy of Robin Harris. Many celebrity voices can be heard as part of the cast and most notabliy Tone Loc as Little O. G.THis is a good theme about love, appreciation, and not letting go of people who are really worth it as as Robin's character says ""being about something!"""
3,"Interesting, but.....","This was actually the first Black-made feature cartoon, brought to you Bruce W. Smith of PROUD FAMILY fame. Essentially, this is a filmed extension of the legendary Robin Harris comedy routine of the same name.Unfortnately, Robin himself died before this got off the ground. Faizon Love does a decent imitation of the master, but it just isn't the same. The story of the buckwild demons (excuseme, I mean kids) turned loose in an amusement park has its moments, but wears thin after a while (espeically the courtroom scene with Presidents George Washington, Lincoln, and Nixon putting the bratocious ones on trial). However, the film makes a grim detour in reality by showing the empty kitchen in the wild kids' equally empty ghetto apartment to make some pointed social commentary on why they are so untamed.This is interesting, but not likely to be viewed more than twice if you get the DVD."
4,Bebe's Kid's,"Love it, glad to have it in my collection. Robin Harris was a very funny man who made us laugh."
3,Good Kids gone Bad,"There are good kids, then there are questionable kids and then there is BeBe's Kids. BBBBBBad to the bone. Time out's will not help these children. ""Stay home and teach your children, Be Be""."
4,Not the best movie for my 3 year old,"This was a movie my older kids loved as kids. Now 10 years later, I realized how crazy this movie is.. Maybe I will break it back out when she is 8 or 9..haha"
3,$44 is too much for a single DVD (must be a mistake),I wouldn't pay $44 for a single DVD. I'm a collector but it's not that serious. (must be a mistake)
5,The best animated comedy ever!,I never laughed as hard as I did the first time I saw this movie. It is hilarious! I highly recommend it.
3,"I like it, but","The clear coat is sticky,the color chips off, andI thought it might taste(at least a little)like candy apple, it does not."
2,"It lasts, but is not that pretty","So, this lipstick lasts for many hours as advertised. However, I don't like it.The color does not blend well with the lips and it looks dry after a short time(it comes with a gloss, not a moisturizer).I'd not buy it again."
4,Excellent treatment of an Enigmatic Reformer,"John Calvin is a man to whom many pledge their spiritual alliegance. However, Cottret is careful to separate the man Calvin from the ensuing Calvinism that developed later. Calvin appears more timid and much more interested in spiritual reform than promoting a theocracy in Geneva. He appears often as an unwilling accomplice in the Protestant Reformation. Yet, his effect is still felt around the world today. Cottret also delves into Calvin's theology and casts him in his different roles."
4,Calvin--A Biography,"This is the fourth book I have read on the subject of ""The Refomation"" (two books by that title), then Luther, now Calvin. Since Calvin did not write much about himself and not a lot is know this book concentrates on the folks around him that incluenced his style. The most interesting revelation in reading all these books is that the three primary ""influencers of opinion"" during the Reformation, Erasmus, Luther and Calvin were not priests but primarily humanist academics. Some speculate it was the printing press that was the most important factor with ELC providing content."
5,Good Cover at a Good Price,I have one of these on my Mustang GT and was looking for another for my Ford Ranger. This is good quality at a great price. Aside from some heavy stretching it installed easily.
4,A fun bunch of shorts!,"These shorts (most of which I had seen in any other collections but WITHOUT the commentary) are great! Could Patriotism be any more vague? Could dogs have whimpy inner voices? Could buying groceries be any more complicated? You have to watch this DVD and find out!I don't feel like the last short, ""Shake Hands With Danger,"" was done that well. I've seen the short without commentary and the song that goes through it is hilarious, but for some reason the sound levels are really off on this one. I'm suprised that it went to production like this.From some of the guys who brought you MST3K..."
4,About as good as MST3Ks,"I've been a big fan of MST3K. I thought RiffTrax might be a bit of a letdown, but still funny- I mean, it has three of the same writers, including the main writer, Mike. There wasn't a letdown. These shorts were very funny."
5,Jokes and Songs to cheer you up!,"First, there are the nine shorts. Buying Food is, to me, the best of them. Have a big family? Buy a big can. Small family? Small can. Really? NO!?! The others sound just as bad as they...well, sound.Down And Out is about workplace safety that shows only idiots getting hurt.Skipper is about a racist dog.It Must Be The Neighbors is about rats and trash and blaming others.Patriotism is about doing everything for others and society and grandma and your dog.Right Or Wrong is a short about deciding if you want to tattle on your friends.The Trouble With Women is hard to explain, so just watch it.Drugs Are Like That is about thinking before you pop that pill. And has a weird songShake Hands with Danger has a nice song and, like Down and Out, is full of idiots getting hurt, getting limbs sliced off or being killed. Fun stuff. Liked the song.Oh, and there are three songs from Bill, Kevin and Mike, so enjoy! Enjoy the humor that is Rifftrax SHORTS! Songs!"
5,Fun party game . . . once,"At certain small parties, this game has been a much bigger hit than TRIVIAL PURSUIT or WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE? The questions are obscure enough to be hard, but fun enough to still feel like a game. Sometimes other trivia games make some partygoers cringe with their lack of knowledge, but this one just makes you laugh. It's fun remembering videos and trying to sift through your mental attic for stuff you KNOW you read in PEOPLE magazine somewhere. It's a great buy, but I would agree with another reviewer who said that it needed more questions.[My durability rating, above, means that, because there aren't enough questions, the initial fun doesn't hold up on replaying, not that there's anything fundamentally defective with the construction of the game pieces themselves.]"
3,Recommended for two segments!,"""Class of '99"" features Vincent Price and Brandon de Wilde in a story of a futuristic (at least, in terms of 1971 audiences) college wherein the final exam reveals the ""readiness"" of potential graduates to embark in society with all its wills and ills. Price is effectively authoritarian as the professor that determines who is ready to leave the institution.""I'll Never Leave You - Ever"", with Lois Nettleton, John Saxon, and character actor Royal Dano, stands as one of the series most memorable horror stories. Nettleton's ""cheating wife"" gets the appropriate justice for her machinations.""A Death in the Family"" with E.G. Marshall and Desi Arnaz, Jr., as well as ""There Aren't Any More MacBanes,"" are mild and rather tepid in comparison to the aforemetioned pair.The other installments are short and amusing, especially the rather kinky ""Satisfaction Guaranteed"" staring Victor Buono."
4,I enjoy this product and it's very useful,I'm using this textbook for a college class and it has a ton of good information. I'd buy it again.
5,Great segway to more advanced statistical concepts,This book is very engaging with plenty of examples. I would recommend at least a semester of Applied statistics and few semesters of Calculus to feel comfortable with concepts in this book.Desired improvements:- Matrix notation for multiple regression could be explained better- 3d graphs for polynomial regression could use more examples
2,..,"I took the stat class using this book as a business major. Although this book had good problem sets using SAS and all, this book was very hard to understand. The examples and the way they explained it didnt help me to understand the material. If it wasn't my professor's lectures, I dont think my whole class could have handled the material. Also, as my Stat TA has told us, this book is not fit for many business students because it is so much in detail that it should be only used to Stat students. I know that there are other stat books that would fit business majors but I dont think this book is the one."
1,why is it out of stock like FOREVER?!?!?!?!?!?!,"I have been waiting for this book for like 2 weeks and it's still out of stock!!!!! That means I still have to wait for a long time for the book to come because it will take time to ship it after it's IN STOCK. i'm not happy about it at all! I'm a student and I need this book to do homework. If it can be out of stock for TWO WEEKS why do you still put it on the list to let people buy? And then make them wait forever? Amazon, I have to say, this time you really make me disappointed.....!!!"
3,"Confused; Which ""Doc Holliday""","I enjoyed the story of the famous dentist, liking the novel treatment rather than the anticeptic treatment usually given to the Earps, Holliday troubles in Tombstone. What has confused me is Mr. Eickhoff's liberal use of the characterization of Holliday made famous in the movie Tombstone. It seems that the latter portion of the book, the Earp years, are steeped in the screenplays of several movie attempts to bring the story to the American public. Mr. Eickhof begins to shape ""Doc"" character from the very beginning to take on the Val Kilmer persona. Mr. Eickhoff has not developed ""his own"" John Henry ""Doc"" Holliday and has played fast and loose with what has already been seen by the general public from 1956 until now. A good read, but a disappointing ""Doc"" and a disappointing rendition of the ""Troubles in Tombstone."""
1,Oh please!,"If you are a Val Kilmer fan you'll just love this book. If you're looking for Doc look elsewhere. Perhaps the best biography of Doc ever written is the long out of print ""DOC HOLLIDAY"" by John Meyers Meyers. If you can find a copy of it you've come close to finding the real John Henry Holiday DDS."
