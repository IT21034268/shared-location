1,Dissatisfied Customer,"I purchased an episode of Breaking Bad just an hour and a half before the current episode was shown on television. However, although I paid Amazon.com for the video, there was a problem with Amazon's system and I kept receiving a message that said try again later. I never got a chance to see the episode that I paid for. Very disappointed with Amazon.com"
5,Breaking Bad,The best written series on T.V. Does it get better than that? Can't wait for the continuation of season 5.
5,Best drama series,So far it has been the best drama tv series on television.Can't wait for the final 8 episodes.Now what do we watch ?
5,Season 5 Brings It!!,"I was on the edge of my seat for all eight episodes, and now I can't wait for the final 8 to end the series. It's going to be one crazy ride....."
5,LOVE IT!!!,LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!! Are you picking up what I'm laying down?
5,Breaking Bad,"I don't know exactly what it is that makes this show more exciting and seemingly ""realistic"" than Weeds, but it was a seriesthat I watched weekly with anticipation. Perhaps it was the knowledge that all would crash at any minute. The plot is themost important, the actors could be your next door neighbor. All the actors and especially the principals are so good at theirjob.....Now a classic TV series."
4,Breaking Bad 5,"Great series, want to keep watching! So excited for the next show. Can't wait for the next few shows! Excellent!"
4,Breaking Bad,Very good show...could not wait for the next episode. Very unusual show...nothing else like it. Looking forward to the last season...
5,Bad to the BONE!,My heart is still beating fast after watching this episode! I will be very sad when this show ends. Just amazing. The ending was so tragic though. Poor kid. Anyone who thinks they glamorize this life is nuts. It's raw and real.
4,Lost Channel,We have lost AMC channel so i have watched all of breaking bad till now on sat. Now this is last year for it and having buy it from itunes. Its cheaper on itunes.
5,Amazing,So sad this is the Final Season. :( Loved playing catch up. Can't wait until the series starts again in the Summer! This show rocks!
2,BB boring,Disappointing. Slow moving and boring. I am Hoping the the next episode is better. Always love Aaron Paul though. Thumbs down.
2,Breaking Bad 5,"A disappointing season all the way around. Only 8 episodes and those felt rushed and disjointed. More like a bridge from season 4 to season 6, really not fair to the audience, but then B.B. does set a high standard for cable tv drama. Hopefully next season B.B will return to form."
5,Freak yeah,"MUST WATCH, plus its filmed in Albuquerque where I'm from!! All of the places they eat at are places I eat at all the time!!!"
3,Good Internet Connection Mandatory,"I don't think I'll be using this method of purchasing episodes anymore. It's very frustrating having an episode you paid for glitch and cut off over and over from internet malfunction. Good show, and i know when you have a good connection this makes sense, just wish we could actually download the episode without pirating!"
5,Breaking Bad 5 Stars,"Breaking Bad gets 5 stars for being the show what it is. From season 1 and episode 1 to season 5 episode 8, this show is awesome. I like everything and anything about Breaking Bad. The only thing that I would like different is for the action to slow down a bit. I know, some people may say ""why slow it down"", but it is just my preference. Other than that a must see show."
4,A good distraction.,"Breaking bad is a great distraction. I watched seasons 1-4, available on Netflix for 7.99 a month. Season five was not available at the time and the show was 5 weeks into season 5. I purchased the 5 episodes on Amazon to get caught up, and then watched the premier viewings on AMC until the end of the season. I have no complaints with either service. (Netflix or Amazon) It would be nice to have the library for this show, but that could be costly buying individually."
5,Fantastic,I am very happy with the season 5 of breaking bad. This show has more twist and turns than a roller coaster. Never know what is going to happen or who will be dealt with next. Amazon has done a great job having Breaking Bad ready to go to be watched next day. One happy customer.
5,Awesome!,This show has my husband and I captivated!!!The show is such an orginal and very refreshing~:)I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for somethingdifferent.
5,Breaking Bad,I loved the episode!! I can't wait for the next part of the season. It worked great had no problems
5,TVs best show,I have watched this from season one and Wwat and Jessie have never let me down. The situations they get into are fun and the way they seem to get out of them makes it an on the edge of your seat suspensefull ride.
5,Love Cranston and Paul,"Breaking bad is one of the best shows on TV! I am one of the unlucky dish members who don't get it, so I came to amazon to purchase season's 8 episodes. I love being able to watch them on my computer and also watch from our ROKU. Love Breaking Bad! Every episode has twists and turns that keep you hanging."
5,OOOH YAH!!!!!,My wife and I have really enjoyed watching this show. Sometimes she cant look at the TV and just says she hates Walt! lol
5,Can't get enough of BB!!,"Every episode is better than the last! I can't believe this is the last season, great writing, great story line, AWESOME characters!!!"
5,Awesome,"My husband and I really enjoy watching Breaking Bad. We were waiting for season 5 to come out on netflix, but couldn't resist just purchasing it off amazon."
5,intriguing,Love this show! It's been a winner since season one and always keeps u on the edge of your seat! Can't wait for season six!
5,Favorite show,"This supplanted ""Mad Men"" as my favorite show. I think it may be the favorite of most of my favorite people, as well. Cool, and always surprising."
5,5 stars!!!!!!!!,"The storyline is a bit twisted, but the acting is outstanding!! Bryan Cranston is sensational. Most of the episodes are quite violent... just an FYI."
3,Going downhill,"A disappointment after the first four seasons. The formula seems played out, the content of each episode diluted and the writers struggling to keep the series alive."
2,"Love this show, NOT Amazon Instant","This is one of the best shows ever. With Amazon Instant, however, we mostly view little circles going around and around as we sit waiting for something to happen."
5,Breaking Bad - Season 5,"Season 5 while a bit dark, continues the fine acting and directing I have been accustomed to in watching the entire Breaking Bad series. I am sad the series is coming to an end."
5,Breaking Bad - Live Free or Die,This episode continues the fine acting and directing I have been accustomed to in watching the entire Breaking Bad series. I am sad the series is coming to an end.
5,Br Ba,"This is a real good series, one of my favorites. I can't wait for next season, I hope it is as good as this one has been."
5,Breaking bad season 5,Once again character Walter White goes thru his ups & downs being meth cook a must see being its final season
5,Heisenberg rules.,"Very taboo. Life with a will and a purpose. Jesse and Mr White are partners and can't help but be. Mrs White is a hagus,the family dynamics is bust.Can't wait for next season"
5,Addicted to this show!,Love the cast of this show...I no sooner finish one episode and want to go on the the next one.
5,Can't stop watching!!!,"Excellent. Dramatic & addictive. My son recommended this series to me and my husband. He was so right. It's one of our all time favorites. The acting is wonderful and the characters are so interesting and complex. The story line gets somewhat dark & disturbing, but in a good way that makes you ask what lengths would you go to for your family."
5,Best Of All Time,"I've watched a lot of TV (and yes, I've seen The Wire), and this is the only series I've ever seen where sometimes I can't fall asleep because I'm thinking about it. Watch from the beginning. Watch every episode. You will not be sorry."
3,show is 5 stars but instant stream sucks,the show is one of my all time favorates but the instant stream quality sucks at least on the pc verson
4,Some small writing flaws starting to show,This is one of the best show ever but this season has some unexplainable writing flaws. If you can get past that it is still well acted and overall great.
5,Bad gets worse and worse.,"This is the end of the dvds we bought to watch Breaking Bad. In this season you see Walter White starting to become a real meth kingpin. It's amazing how this character has developed through the seasons from a mild discouraged teacher to the cruel empathy lacking man he is becoming.This is definitely a series worth owning. The actors are so talented and believable, and really hand-picked for their roles."
5,Five Star,Purchase this series and start with season 1 episode 1. You will be hooked by episode 3.This is one of the best series I have ever seen!!&#11088;&#11088;&#11088;&#11088;&#11088;
5,Gotta Love Walt and Jessie,"What can I say? Season 5 is more of the same. The writers have not lost their touch for the combination of suspense and humor that makes this such a great series. I was able to find reruns of season 5 on AMC, but I missed the first couple episodes, so I purchased them here."
4,Breaking Bad.... NOT BAD,This product wasn't available anywhere else.It has Good quality but it had a lot of annoying streaming connection pauses.I have AMC on demand on FIOS but they seem to hold back and make you pay for it.....It's not right...double dipping.
5,awesome,"hands down the best show ever on tv.....bryan cranston can really carry a show, and the writing is as good as it gets"
4,breaking bad,"The beginning is a bit slow, but it rapidly becomes very suspenseful and exciting. If you think they wrapped everything up at the end of the last season - they didn't."
5,Edge Of My Seat,"I missed watching the first 8 episodes of Breaking Bad Season 5 and could not WAIT for it to re-run on TV. I bought the instant video and actually watched all 8 episodes in a row through out the day, taking my lap top with me wherever I went. Absolutely spellbinding and so easy to download into my Video Library.Amazon rocks!"
4,great series,"Just what i needed. Fun to watch. Just one question? Why is this more mainstream than The Wire? Both are great shows. One is just free with my Netflix, one is not."
5,cookin',"Exceptional acting, all characters. Great ability on part of the writers to keep viewer attention. Very realistic in content. Keep writing...I'll keep watching!"
5,awesome!!,I freaking love this show!!!!!! Its bad ass . this t.v. Show Is number one! Got all my friends and family hook on this!!!
1,Amazon streaming is sucks,"Great series, but Amazon's streaming is junk. If I had time I'd ask a refund from them. about every five minutes it'd start stalling and stuttering. Netflix never does that. Not acceptable."
1,Not so great,"Really hate streaming with Amazon. Dish Network no longer provides AMC, so the only way we can view our favorite show is with Amazon. We purchase HD, and the quality is not high definition. The streaming continually freezes up. So ready to be finished with Dish network and Amazon!"
1,Why only 8 episodes this year????,This show rocks!!!!!! Im so bummed that they only made 8 episodes this year and I have to wait till next year to see it again.
5,Polos,Wow. This entire series is excellent. Great acting and a wonderfully supported plot. I can't get enough but realize the story must end eventually.
5,AMAZING,Amazing show! Great cast and the storyline draws you in right away! Highly addicting... once you start watching you can't stop!
5,Breaking Bad,Very happy with purchase. Would definitely recommend. This was a very imaginary and creative episode. I's sad to think that the series will be coming to a close. *****
3,Breaking Bad,"I viewed five episodes of Breaking Bad so far via Amazon. The first episode I downloaded in HD, however, the HD quality was so bad that subsequent episodes were downloaded not in HD to save a buck, same quality."
5,Hardcore,"Wow, what an episode. This one not only had me on the edge of my seat, but it brought me to tears as well. What a show!!"
5,Easy peasy!,Really quick process to get these episodes going on my laptop. Breaking Bad is THE best show ever made. Highly recommend the experience here on AMAZON
5,"More, please....","Iam going to re-watch this entire series until they make more, cause 5 seasons are not enough! My fingers are crossed..."
4,Continued Intrigue,"The series heads forward towards the inevitable. Walt's decline as a moral actor pushes into new areas, while his wife's slow embrace of the dark side moves towards her own decision. Jesse clings to some hope for redemption. Praise for the decision to restore the Mike character."
4,I loved it!,"If you watched the first 4 seasons, you have to watch season 5. It gets a bit incredible but it is fun as all get out. Highly recommend, can't wait for the second half of the final season!"
5,INCREDIBLE,Eases you right back into where last season left off then digs right into some craziness.Walt is so awesome now!This is a more than worthwhile purchase.
5,Loved it!,Can't wait for the 2nd half to air. This is an addicting show. I would suggest starting with Season 1.
4,The man you love to hate,"Walt gets more and more involved, and increasingly difficult to watch. Hooks you in, however and you can't help but wonder what will happen next!"
5,awesome,Addicted to Breaking Bad. Streaming was not an issue with this one. Had to catch up so we could watch the latest season. Thanks Amazon!
5,Best bad show on TV,"This show is soo damn good, with all it's nitty gritty violence it forces you to watch week after week... Can't wait for the new episodes to begin next year"
3,Is this really a romance novel?,"The writing is good, all perspectives are explained well. But the story has too much abuse. You can easily believe when she says with words and actions that she fears him, but cannot believe how the fear turned into love. For a third of the book, hero disappers. When he gets back, things take a turn for the worse. In fact, at every turning point, I was waiting for their relationship to turn positive, but it only became more miserable. Even towards the end (chapter 36 out of the 39), there is whipping and rape. It is a good thing that I already love SEP. I am naturally looking for good points about this book and hence the three stars. If this was written by some unknown author, I would have given a one star."
1,Disastrous!!!!,"from beginning to end that novel is a big disaster, its a very abusive relationship from beginning to end, i lost count of how many times he raped her or hit her or did something equally terrible. The heroine was constantly abused and violated physically as well as emotionally and psychologically eckkk it was bad all over. The hero kept a grudge over something his father did, yet he kept doing things much worse than the father"
2,Not exactly romance...,"Some of this book is good, a lot of it is so angsty and horrifying that you can only laugh to keep from crying. My favorite line: ""my dear wife, even though I took a whip to you in the stable and raped you, you must understand that I really love you."" Seriously, that's what really happened. I was rooting for different pairings the entire time. The ""hero"" is a truly awful person and this book is just a mess. It's definitely not a feel-good romance."
4,Not what i expected....but,"This book is not politically correct but it is still a book that reels you in and doesnt let go till the last page. Yes its not the typical romance where the hero treats the heroin like a porcelain doll...its the complete opposite but she actually explains her point of view, which although sounds like a massochist she admits it to herself and to the reader...its a very entertaining book and a wonderfull read. Im glad i bought it!"
5,You have to love SEP,"I just began my appreciation for romance lit, and would have to say Susan Elizabeth Phillips is my favorite author of this particular genre. As her first book, it is very well done. I would not have expected anything less! The only complaint, a very minor one, would be the number of pages dedicated to turing the pickpocket into a lady before the story returns to Quinn and Noelle. I very much enjoyed the characters as well as the plot. Unfortunately, this book is a small fortune. I'm not sure why it hasn't been republished. It's a shame it is not available to the masses. I didn't see anything inappropriate about the story, perhaps not as politically correct as it could be, but I wouldn't change a thing.Would I buy it again? Yes, but I enjoy reading and collecting books. If you enjoy Susan Elizabeth Phillips, it is definitely worth reading."
2,Buyer Beware,"If you already own ""Quilting Patterns from Native American Designs"" and ""Native American Designs for Quilting"" do not bother with ""Native American Designs 2."" As Ms Mori states in the introduction, which it is unlikely most folks read prior to ordering this book, ""Native American Designs 2"" is a selection of her favorites from the titles shown above. It does have a few ""bonus"" patterns, but if you're expecting additions to Ms Mori's previous excellent compilations, this isn't it."
3,Where's Michael?,"Inarguably,this album was the Jacksons' worst and most forgettable,ever. There's Jackie,Tito,Marlon,Jermaine and Randy but where's Michael? I guess we could say Michael is enjoying his persistent success as a solo performer,living off his endless royalties from sales of his OFF THE WALL,BAD and THRILLER albums. Minus Michael,the group should have gone back to what they originally were,the Jackson Five. Personally,I thought the album was cool,but DESTINY,TRIUMPH and VICTORY were far better than this. Michael personally made the Jackson 5/Jacksons popular."
1,Never heard it before.,I would buy it if Michael Jackson was on the album. But he's not. If he was singing on the CD. I wouldn't make any hesitating about buy this album. Maybe if Michael stop being stubborn he and his brothers could do another renuion album and tour. I hope he change his good sweet heart. I hope so.
3,"I'll admit, it's not their best","But being the Jackson fan that I am, I have to say that because I know they had better albums out. I noticed a lot of people were wondering Where's Michael on this album. It was unfortunate that he only collaborated on the song 2300 Jackson Street, but hey maybe one day when they decide to do another album he'll be more on there. I was upset that Janet didn't do anything but collaborate on 2300 either. I think Randy could've left the song that he had on there in regards to his motorcycle off of the album. But I still enjoyed the rest of the album. What would be cool is if they do another album and turn it into a family thing, where each one does a song or two and then do a family song. That would be nice."
3,Good to Own,"It may not be the best Jackson album, but it does good to complete the collection of the iconic group. The copy I have has no cover (which is a pity seeing as I'm always curious to know who is or was involved with the songs in detail and the pictures) but it only take 5% of the enjoyment from the album."
2,Junk,"This product is a raw list of vocabulary words accompanied by a reading of them on the CD. There are three main drawbacks to this program:1. It is an ineffective way of learning vocabulary. Try a program that combines vocabulary with dialogue. Pimsleur is the best, Rosetta Stone is great, Living Language Complete Course for Beginners is decent.2. The vocabulary words are antiquated and far from being commonly used... or so say my Korean language exchange partners.3. The vocabulary lists switch from English-Korean to Korean-English. Without already knowing the vocabulary or reading along it is impossible to know which track you are listening to. I want a program I can use without the book while I am working or exercising."
4,Better than others,"This is the first level Korean Vocabulary builder, and it's just that, it's a whole lotta words that you can practice. There is a book inside, but I'm not sure if it'll be very useful to someone who can't read Korean!! This is more for the heritage speaker (like me) or refresher for someone who has previous experience in Korean. I do not recommend this to beginners. There are some phrases which are kinda outdated but nevertheless it's good for immersion learning. You'll never find a 'great' learning material on this language. In fact, that's probably one of the reasons why it's one of the critical needs language defined by the US State Dept. However, there are 4 CDs in this kit, so you feel like you're getting your money's worth. If you want to learn Korean, buy/rent/borrow a bunch of these types of CDs/books and find a local Korean to help you."
4,A WIld WINSTON,"There was just something about her that drew him in. Of course she was making passes at him and saying things like ""I want you"" but she had a wacky family and a ridiculous costume that she wore to work. But there was that passion and that fire that seemed to come to surface everytime those two were within a few feet of each other. It was na great read just like all of Lori Foster's books."
5,My first Lori Foster book - but it won't be my last!,"This was the first time I have ever read a Lori Foster novel. She knows what the reader wants and she definitely delivers. The characters are alive with passion, and she is an accomplished writer who can weave an entertaining tale. I look forward to going ""backwards"" and reading all about the ""brothers""."
4,Another Winston brother has stolen my heart!,"After much anticipation for this book, I was very pleased with ""Wild"" and it's characters! Zane Winston, the ""playboy"" brother, comes to light as a protective, sensual and sensitive hero, perfect to pair with the heroine bold enough to approach him outright with her desire for him! Ms. Foster realistically portrays the fraternal relationships among the Winstons and neatly contrasts their stability against the kookiness of Tamara Treymayne's family. The chemistry between the hero and heroine is so explosive, it's hard to believe they've avoided each other for as long as they did before finally doing something about it. But their getting together is a delight for the reader, a sensual and fun love story that offers thrills and laughs. ""Wild"" is an excellent example as to why Ms. Foster has become one of today's favorite authors!"
1,A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"This was my first LF book, and definitely the last. A shallow plot, with Zane getting ...page one and stayes that way until doomsday, boring ang sometimes very stupid dialogues and a very s-l-o-w progress on the story line convinced me to give up after about 150 pages. True, there was a lot of talking and thinking abouy sex, and usually I like it very much in a book - but the problem here was there wasn't anything beside it, and I prefer something more in my heroes [it's a little habbit of mine...].To sum up: Don't bother."
1,This is SOOO Bad,"This truly is one of the most vapid romances I've ever read. I don't know who recommended it to me, but this is the stuff that gives romance the bad reputation it occasionally deserves. The one good thing about it is that if you are thinking of a career in writing, this could offer you hope -- if they publish this nonsense, just think how much better you could do!"
5,Excellent Book!,"Lori Foster has done it again! Zane Winston is totally Wild! And Tamara is his perfect match. Zane is just like his brothers Cole, Chase, & Mack. He is dropped dead gorgeous and intelligent with a wonderful sense of humor to boot. The chemistry between Tamara & Zane really keeps you glued to the pages. Tamara is the ""gypsy next door"" to Zane's computer business. She tells Zane exactly what she wants of him. Zane is both shocked and intrigued. The sparks fly when they are in the same room! Their antics along with those of their families will keep you laughing and smiling through the whole book. When Tamara is in danger, Zane steps up and will do anything he can to keep her safe. A very riveting novel keeping in tradition with the rest of the Winston Brother's stories."
4,I Want Wild...,"""I Want You""... what a way to approach a gorgeous guy! And he turns her down!?!? Luckily, that's not the end of the book. It's only the beginning, and Zane and Tamara's story is a truly wild continuation of the super novellas on ""The Winston Brothers."" Having Zane fall to the ""Winston Curse""... with a gypsy who's not exactly as she appears! I truly liked reading about these 4 brothers and noting their differences. Each one is so unique, you're bound to find one you can't resist and likely, more than one. In WILD, bringing in cousin, Joe, is a ""hoot"" and keeps our hopes alive that there will be at least one more chance to visit the wonderful Winston men. Great sequel Ms. Foster and looking forward to Joe's story."
4,4th book in Winston Brother Series,This is the Zane and Tamara story. Tamara works as a psychic and decided that before she leaves town she has to have one night with the hottest Winston Brother Zane. Zane has been having erotic dreams on the dark haired Tamara and can't pass up her offer... Check out all the Winston Brother stories and Say to No to Joe? (cousin the Winston brothers and being of the Visitation NC series).
4,joining the periphery,"the furry's have done just that with the first ever all Welsh record (that i am aware of ha ha ha). however, just because only about a million people in the world can understand this language doesn't mean it is not easily appreciated. For instance check out the last track on the first CD and you'll realise exactly how talented singer Gryff Ryss really is."
4,Good,"Super Furry Animals fans, have something to look forward too, this album is really good, a little bit more alterative then the last but the melodies are the same quality. The gitars are as sharp as ever."
2,they've lost it...,"I bought this record hoping to receive a bit of weirdness and originality and having now listened to it I have to say that it really labbs big time! For a start (sorry to all you Furries followers out there), it's almost entirely unoriginal and just seems to copy so many other albums (most notably `Mezzanine' by fellow Bristolians MASSIVE ATTACK) and from start to finish it's totally LABBING MAN!!!! I just don't see how they were signed to Mo Wax in the first place. The Furries' sound is very overdone and I think they spent far too much cash on the production. They are clearly trying to be a part of the scene pioneered by Mogwai/Blink 182. Hope you are a bit more adventurous with the next album guys!"
2,Total lack of information,"I wish I could have seen and got a chance to thumb through this book,it is not a guide at all,it does give useful locations of things but no help whatsoever on the important things like weapons or people to use,the ""Profiles"" given on the people in the game are useless and it give no stratagy at all,please see my review for the game itself as to why"
1,i like blind gaurdian but....,i dont understand why they would cover the song mr sandmanlike in back to the fucther i think if this had come out in the fifties this version would sound better.you might not like this one
4,Serious package in fun wrapping,"I read this book twice - once for me (as a sort-of adult) and once with my 10 year old daughter. Interestingly, the things I thought were funny initially went right over her head, but we laughed out loud together at other parts. Yet the deeper questions of spirituality weren't lost either time.I see this less as ""southern"" fiction and more as an adaptable story that happens to take place in the south, with all the accuracy and authenticity to make the storyline stick. The best thing I can say is that my daughter and I were savoring the last few pages, half-hoping it wouldn't end. But it did... well I might add.Great fun and a message too. When was the last time that happened?"
2,Strong Odor,The wallet is just the size I needed & looks well made but the chemical odor is overpowering. I'm hoping that the odor dissipates soon!
5,"Legs, pits and pube hair beware!","The Vibrance system was the best ever made. When this batch of baldes are gone, not sure what she will do."
2,"Didn't do much for me, either.","Lightweight Celtic-rock from a young Scottish band, with too-perky playing and somewhat bland, inspirational lyrics. I didn't feel there was a lot of depth to the playing, or that lead singer Ali Cherry has a particularly impressive voice. They're cute and all, in a puppydog-ish way, but I can think of plenty of other records I'd want to spend my time with more."
2,Elevator Music,Very talented harmonica player but if you are looking for harp music like you would hear on a Willie Album this is not the cd for you.
3,Left me Flat,"Ms. Garlock is a real genius in her writing, but this book left me flat. I have read almost all of her work, and even with my lack of interest in this book, she is still far superior to other writers of frontier novels.What I didn't like about this book was that it was so predictable. I don't want to go into spoiler mode, so will just say that I did not think this was one of her best stories."
3,Good but could have been better,"I struggled to read this book, but otherwise a very good book . The characters were well developed and the story line was very well written. the languge of the book and some of the misspellings were hard to translate but could understand it most of the tim and i liked how the book ended. very good gay novel."
5,Not your typical gay teen coming of age book.,"I really enjoyed this book. It is not the typical gay teen coming of age book, but is a nice change from the normal. It was a nice to read about a young gay character who's life isn't only about sex. This book truly captures the heart of (Kevin) the books main character. A must read for older teens to adults."
5,I like it a lot,"Set in Minnesota, this superbly-written novel tells the story of a teenager struggling with his sexuality and also his mother's death. His internal struggles display both angst and humor, and while he can be a bit of a jerk at times, ultimately he wins the reader's heart. Most readers can relate to his embarrassments, his anger, his longing, and his confusion, making this a memorable read for just about anyone."
4,Not flawless but a must read!\,"Running an LGBT youth center, I read virtually all of the coming of age teen fiction books. Without hestitation I can say that most are poorly written, unrealistic, or just not fun to read.I simply adored this book. Yes, it has flaws. Yes, the ending was a let down. But, its characters, especially Kevin, were so much fun to get to know.(...). In one line (""I think you'd like it [Greenwich]. I guess.""), we know that Kevin will be accepted and find his love.I don't need sequel to tell me what I can already see in Kevin's future. Mr. Malloy give us another story - one that will warm our hearts!"
3,Fairly slight.,"I thought this book was fairly slight. It is an interesting enough read but does not really leave any lasting impression. It is reasonably well written but again I did not think it was anything beyond average.I thought the character development was not particularly strong except for Aunt Nora, and sadly this character was not really explored or developed."
3,Mundane,This is a rather run-of-the-mill rendering of teenage angst. The question concerning the mother's demise is central to the story and is the real reason for seeing the book through to the end. One bright spot is the surprise about the neighbor across the street.
5,Universal Appeal,"This straight, female middle-aged reader read about gay male teenage longing and thought, ""YES! That's it exactly!"" I'm not quite sure how Brian Malloy achieved that, but I'm so glad he did.And he's funny! When I read funny books, I smirk. I chuckle under the surface. It's very rare that I laugh out loud. This book has more than its fair share of laugh-out-loud moments. But it isn't a comic novel. It's a touching one that just happens to have hilarious lines. I think Malloy's greatest achievement is finding a way to make the specifics of his characters' lives something we can all relate to. He's done a magnificent job.I envy those of you who are yet to read this book for the first time. You are in for such a treat."
5,Sweet as honey!,I defenetly recomend this album or any of DJ's CD's to anyone!! This guy just do it!!! Every song have that something that hookes you right from the start! I'm a BIG DJ fan and this album is just as good as all the rest! This guy have a voice sweet as honey! You woun't regret getting this album...I just luv every song on it!!!
3,interestingly bland,"This is the first book i've read by Whorton. The book droned on through the vast majority of the plot, but his occasionally poetic, sometimes southern style made it interesting. The story was slow to evolve and the readers attention seemed ill focused. Dove, the main character's friend seemed to steal away the attention in this novel. I think the book would have been better had more attention been focused on Dove and less on the main character. Don't expect monumental things from this book, however Whorton show's promise as a unque new author."
4,Enjoy the book,I always enjoy Louis L'Amour stories. The Proving Trail remains an exceptional legacy of his western adventure tales. You can visualize Kearny McRavens dilemmas as the pages turn. A very good read.
1,wrong picture for this item,The item listed is for an action bank of Hagrid in a Gringots rail car. The picture is of a Hedwig Key chain. Put up the correct picture and I'll redo the evaluation.
5,Excellent work!,"Even though I watched the moovie before reading the book, I read it on one breath. I think this is the best book I've ever held in my hands."
4,get the book,The movie is good but the book is so much better. But you already knew that. The book is always better.
5,Fascinating,"It was a very interesting read. I was enthralled through the whole thing but for anyone who wants to read this, do not think of compare it to the move. They're so different."
5,LOVED this book.,Really worth reading; gives the reader food for thought. Great for people on a spiritual quest.
5,"I read this book in the early 80's, and it gave me ...","much peace of mind.I saw this weekend that a movie was made, and is rather dissapointed to learn that the movie might not be as good.Everybody is entitled to his/her own opinion, but the book was so REAL, I had to read it in one session. After that, I re-read it many times, until a friend did not return the book. But now, thanks to Amazon...The experiences described in the book are so positive - therefor I am not surprised that this book is described as 'dangerous' from a religious point of view.However, that is not always the case - does anybody remember Jacob's Ladder?Thank you for a wonderful book."
4,This story really touched my heart!,"It's the greatest story ever told. Someone in heaven loves me and yearns to reach me. The only way to be with me is to come to where I am and be willing to suffer with me the wages of sin--my hell. But that someone loves me enough that he does that, just for me. And, I am saved. This, of course, is the story of The incarnation of the Word as Jesus, the basis of the Christian religion. Whether he knows it or not, Matheson has retold it beautifully in the setting of the deepest love a man can have for a woman."
5,To all of those who love or have loved...this book is it!!!,"After watching the movie,I knew that the book and myself were destined to be together! Just last week, I found myself glued to the last few pages during my Physics class, trying to conceal the tears that were flowing down my face. This book brings both love and happiness, along with the faces of reality into a unique and wonderful mesh. I have been through so many things in my life that I thought I was destined to be alone in this world. However, this book has given my hope and perserverance that there is something greater out there to look forward to. It has also given me the chance to look at myself and see just exactly how I can change in order to obtain that peace of mind we all want out of life. I recommmend this book to any and everyone. It is one that I will never forget and will pass on to all that visit my path."
5,Back in Print at long last!,"Considered by many to be a classic in the genre, 'What Dreams May Come' has been out of print for almost two decades. Now at long last, it is again availible to delight a new cadre of readers with its wonder. Although billed as a work of fiction/fantasy, this work contains one of the most exhaustive bibliography's regarding life after death ever compiled. Matheson has done his homework. He tears the lid off of the hereafter without taking away any of the surprise or joyr. He manages to present a plausible after life without goring too many sacred cows and will not offend those of any faith who truly wish to learn more about thier belief systems. Compelling, thought-provoking, and just down-right interesting for those of any or no religion. Robin Williams as the Chris character promises to deliver an intriguing film version."
1,His view of Heaven is hellish,"After reading Richard Matheson's ""What Dreams May Come"" I must say that I'm glad his push for the afterlife is not based upon reality. Yes, he has an extensive bibliography, but it is not complete - it is biased.As I read this book I kept thinking, ""If heaven were truly like this, it's awful"". Chris, the main character, is tormented there by his thoughts about his wife and therefore cannot obtain any sense of peace. There was no homecoming, no greeting or welcome upon his entrance. He was alone with a dog.The way Matheson writes, the books come across more like he is trying to sell something rather than as a story. I really got tired of it quickly.While many criticize the Christian view of Heaven, at least there one can experience peace, freedom from torment, and enjoy eternal life with others who have been faithful to Christ."
1,What Dreams may come,How the Author treated the subject matter described in the cover of booked was offensive to me and I chose not to read the book
3,an overly sentimental piece of life-after-death nonsense,"Richard Matheson has written some great science fiction. However this piece of work, which is among his most popular, is rather disappointing. The story is about a deceased man who tries to reconnect with his wife whilst he is wandering around heaven. There is a lot of chatter and existential blather, but not much action ... and zero suspense. Worse, this guy's over the top lovey-dovey yearning for his wife is treacly sweet - bleech!!!Bottom line: Richard Matheson has done much better. 'What Dreams May Come' seems almost amateurish."
1,WINDED,"Would of been better if 100pages shorter. Found myself skimming and skipping, which was unfortunate because the subject matter had potential As far as the love story...only Chris was in love. They weren't soulmates . They weren't on the same wave length (vibration) at all. They didn't share the same beliefs. And Ann was absolutely! steadfastly! close-minded to the possibility of an afterlife, even when it might potentially reuniting her with Chris. As to the ""facts"", and Bibliography...ahch , who knows. I'm definitely open. The book was published in '78."
1,Not as good as other Life-after-death explorations,"A previous reviewer already mentioned two of the books I consider superior/more entertaining to this, i.e., ""Job:..."" by Heinlein and ""The Great Divorce"" by C.S. Lewis. To this, I would only add some of Mark Twain's essays, available in ""The Bible according to Mark Twain"". You're better off with any of the three. (See the movie though...:)"
1,A Very Poor Book Indeed,"I hope anyone with a taste for a well-constructed piece of literature with characters of some depth and interest will forego the waste of time that this book will entail because it really doesn't work. A hopeless hodgepodge of pseudo theology and philosphy wherein the main character is merely a mouthpiece for the writer's lame ideas of the 'afterlife'. No matter what the individual readers' wish list is for that land after death, a writer of fiction is reasonably responsible for a clear sense of some purpose and direction for the characters which this book has not. It is very boring and repetetive. The only imaginative section being the trip through hell which is very short and quite lame compared with Dante or even Larry Niven in their respective Infernos."
1,Blather,"This book was one of the most annoying I've read in a long time. The character Chris was such a whiner! He could not be happy - anywhere - not even in Summerland (Heaven), which seemed pretty awesome. If Chris and his wife were such soulmates, then he should have been more patient and willing to accept the fact that they would be together eventually.All the talk of 'vibrations' and 'spiritual transcendance' was just new age psycho-babble. And Mr. Matheson seemed inclined to describe them ad-infinitum.I believe in true love, and I do not doubt in the existence of a heaven/hell, but the description of these offered by Mr. Matheson does not ring true."
2,My Personal Opinion,"Richard Matheson is a very talented and precise author. [If you're not a Christian, feel free to skip the rest of this review]. This book specifically and viciously attacks Christianity at the finale. It was not for me and I regret reading it. I recommend Heaven by Randy Alcorn for a far more positive image of Heaven."
2,It wasn't as good as I hoped it would be,"At times, this book was intriguing and interesting. And I must give the author credit -- considering this was written in the 70's, long before the life after death phase. However, the book drug on and on and by the end, it had gotten a bit silly. Some people may enjoy the love story aspect of it. I found the ""soulmate"" love story idea to be a bit sappy and over done. I also found myself skipping through large sections of this man telling this woman how much he loved her and remembering long boring moments together. The first half is definately the best and the ending leaves you with a feeling of incompleteness. A good read -- worth it if you have nothing else to read and definately worth it for the bio list in the back. However, don't plan to keep this one on your shelf to re-read time and again."
5,I read this book and will never forget it-5 stars,"I read What Dreams May Come when it first came out. It is one of the best books about reincarnation that I have ever read, after all these years, I still have my original hardcopy, I have recommeded the book many times to friends and anyone who will listen to me. I am so happy that it is being reprinted, at last and very excited about the Robin Williams movie, I just hope the movie can live up to Richard Matheson""s beautiful book. My daughter died of Leukemia in 1978, reading this book helped me with my grief process. I have read it so many times, and I guess my only fear, when I read it the first time was that she, too, would choose to ""come back"" before I could see her again. Now I know that she is always with me and I have set her soul free to be ""where she wants to be"" Thank you Mr. Matheson for writing such an inspiring book."
5,This book saved my life,I read this book in the 70s and it saved my life. It made me take a look at what might happen to me if I ended my life prematurely. This book is very thought provoking if you take it a little deeper than for pure entertainment purposes only. This is especially true when you discover the research that the author poured into this work regarding the afterlife. Koodos to the author for being at the forefront of factual based fiction!
5,Metaphysically Satisfying,"Where the movie was interesting, the book delved into the realms of earthbound life and the somewhere after that offered ""hope"" that humans have sought for ages."
2,What Dreams May Come,"I was somewhat disappointed with What Dreams May Come, especially the way the book ends. Parts of it were interesting, but the overall tone left something to be desired."
4,Makes you think,"Only halfway finished, but so far so good. It's a book club read so it's been interesting! I would recommend it to others."
5,This book is definitly a must read!! INCREDIBLE!,"Our bookclub chose this book to read for the month of October. I will admit to not being very excited about reading it. I will now admit that it turned out to be one of the most fascinating books I have ever read!!! It evoked such strong emotions and feelings inside of me. I picked it up to read it, and could not stop! This book will go on my personal list of the best books I've ever read."
1,ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is one of the greatest books that I have evr read. O.K., so it's not Dante, or Moore, or whomever, but Matheson never claimed to be. Read it as a book -one that can enlighten your mind and help you look at things in a different way -not MAKE you look at things in a different way. One of the lasting messages in this book is that IT'S ALL IN YOUR MIND, HOW YOU THINK OF THINGS, AND YOU, AND YOU ALONE, DECIDE WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO THINK. Yep, Dante was pretty damn insightful, but even HE didn't have the PERFECT THOUGHTS.... ARE THERE ANY?"
2,A downward spiral into literary hell,"Oh, wow, did this book start off wonderfully! But guess what? The sheer joy ended about a hundred pages before the end, comparable to the sort of silence that falls after someone cuts a loud fart. Get it? Don't bother! I should probably sue for my money back and tack on damages for mental anguish. Ew, ick!"
2,Not Nearly as Good as the Movie,"It is a strange occurrence when a book is inferior to the movie, but this proves exception to the rule. I picked up this novel after experiencing amazing film starring Robin Williams.The first thing that struck me is how Richard Matheson seems to believe this story is true and also how many people were quoted as breathlessly claiming that this book changed there life. To consider this anything more than interesting fantasy, it to relegate this book to New Age psycho-babble.To make matter worse, the characters aren't nearly as developed as in the film. Matheson also removed the subplot about the death of their children. That makes the wife's suicide more selfish and disrupts the emotional power of the story.Matheson's descriptions can't begin to describe the amazing visuals the film supplied. So in my judgement, by the DVD. Not the book."
1,An unfortunate book,"What Dreams May Come is a perfect example of what not to do. Perfect proof that modern man is completely cut off from any authentic tradition capable of dealing with questions of any substance. Is there anything from the Bible, Milton, St. Augustine, anything, in here? No. Its based largely on New Age books, self help books from the past twenty years. Think McDonalds drive thru for the soul. If you want a real journey, and a book that will make you work for it, do yourself (and your soul) a favour and read Dante's Divine Comedy. Skip this wishy washy, Hallmark, protestant tripe. As somebody said, 'get serious, or go to hell.'"
1,What a disillusion!!,"After having read almost all the reviews of this book I simply had to have it but frankly, I do not understand all those lyrical works. The book was a disappointment from the start with a pathetic, all-time low end. Even if Mr. Matheson likes us to believe the depiction of heaven is based on scientific research, in my view it is pure conjecture and a subjective portrayal of what perhaps he would like it to look like. As far as the book being a support for people recently bereaved as others have suggested; I think a shoulder to cry on and the loving friendship from those around us will prove to be more effective! Oh yes, like one or two others I stayed up late too to finish this book but for an entirely different reason: to be able to start reading an exciting book the next morning."
1,Inane and very poorly written.,"I listened to this on tape and only made it through because I had nothing else during a long drive. What an unappealing, one-dimensional concept; his heaven sounded like Stalinist Russia, run by a bunch of unpleasant bureaucrats. nor was his devotion to his wife convincing or moving -- an impression confirmed when he began an endless litany (one of so many in this book) thanking her for the things she had done for him-- and keeping herself clean was one of the top items. Huh? This is an unparalleled love? Please. And where were his editors? The amount of repetition he got away with was really sad.Altogether a chilling and dull book."
3,A solid work of spiritual fiction.,"I really wanted to like this book more than I did. I love the spiritual genre. Celestine Prophecy, Illusions, and Way of the Peaceful Warrior are some of my favorite titles. But I never did get emotionally involved in the story. I share Matheson's vision of heaven and hell so the book turned out to be more validation rather than revelation for me. I also have never had anyone close to me die, yet. Perhaps a re-read is in order when that time comes."
5,Unforgettable Imagery,"I read this book over 10 years ago and I still can't forget the images Matheson painted. The visions of heaven and hell are so intense. I can't imagine them making a movie out of this book, at least not one that lives up to the book. Sometimes imagery in books far surpasses imagery in the movies and I suspect that will be the case here. Read the book before you see the movie!"
5,Incredible!,"Richard Matheson is one of the most incredible writers that I've had the good graces to read. Mr. Matheson's prose is unbelievingly imaginative, and is thoroughly researched. His skill as a writer is one that I hope to possess one day, because he truly has the gift of writing.""What Dreams May Come"" is a bundle of after-life theories that make complete sense, and I hope with all of my heart this scenario is what happens after we pass. I highly recommend this novel to those who are anxious about what happens when we die. After reading this book, I believe it is nothing to fear.Please read this novel, it is so worth it."
4,Not Bad at all,I bought the book after I read the great reviews here. The book was up to my expectations but there are some loopholes in the story and I agree totally that the ending was abrupt. The storyline was great with all the details of Heaven that one could possibly think of. But i sincerely think it does not deserve the full mark!
5,"First , read the book, then see the movie.","I did appreciate the movie, but it seems that it was more concerned with its special effects (it did win the Oscar)than it was with the real story. This book rules! I'm amazed it took so long for me to discover it. Whether or not your beliefs correlate with the whole afterlife scenario, it is still the most tender love story you will ever read."
5,Absolutely Beautiful,It is a book that will make you think about your life and what you have done with it
3,Worth reading,"I thought this was an interesting book and read it mostly in one sitting. It does, however, descend into sentimentality and silliness at the end, which was unfortunate because, for me, it overshadowed a lot of interesting ideas.If you are interested in ideas of life, death and afterlife, it is probably worth reading. If you stop about 30 pages short of the end, you will enjoy it more."
5,The one book of a lifetime,"I read this book 15 years ago and it changed my life. It literally fell out off the library shelf. I have tried to find this book all over the world but unfortunately it was out of print. The book had a huge impact on me and changed my worldview for ever. This is the time when that statement ""If you only read one book in your life, read this book"" really applies."
2,Not a love story,"I saw the movie before I read the book and, as many know the book is almost always better than the movie. Well this is the exception. The movie was visually stunning and the story was touching. I am of the opinion that there is nothing more fulfilling when it comes to reading, than a good love story unfortunately this book does not deliver. Maybe it's because the book is more fantastic than it is love story and I went in to it with the wrong mind set. Don't even get me started on the lame ending. If you want a good love story skip the book and watch the movie."
2,"Interesting premise, LONG, drawn-out Story","After reading I am Legend and really liking the author's style, I picked up this book. Some thought I am Legend was too short. I thought it was perfect for if it were any longer it might take on the form of this superfluous story.What Dreams May Come should have been edited down because the story was decent."
1,"Richard B. or Richard C.? Hey, Amazon...","Amazon lists the father's books under the son's name. What's the deal? Richard Burton Matheson wrote the original What Dreams May Come, Incredible Shrinking Man, Somewhere in Time, etc. How can authorship change after more than 25 years in publication? (One star for confusion, not for the book)."
3,Well-done but heavy-handed,"This is a novel about a love that transcends death. Chris is a writer who dies in an auto accident. He goes to heaven, or at least one part of heaven called the Summerland, but he misses his wife, his soulmate. Albert is a cousin who is his guide in heaven. Chris wants to reassure his wife, a skeptic, that heaven exists and that he exists. She commits suicide later in the novel, and Albert reluctantly agrees to take Chris to the lower realms, where Hell is, to find her.This is a good novel but a little heavy handed in its moralizing and what seems, to me at least, to be misguided metaphysics. The scenes of Chris remembering past scenes with his wife are often forced, her dialog seems awkward and she never comes across as a real character. It is compelling reading, as most Matheson is, but seems to lack a real convincing story. The scenes in hell are quite memorable."
2,A Non-Christian View of Death,"I did enjoy the story's plot of a man and a woman who's love was stronger than death, but I don't really like the neglect the author has for the fact that one must have faith in Jesus Christ to go to heaven."
3,For entertainment only!,"I saw the movie starring Robin Williams and decided that I simply had to read the book. I come from a christian back ground (protestant), and I had a lot of problems with the book. All of these problems could have been avoided, if the author had not made out that his book was not a work of fiction--he actually enticed the reader to believe that it was basically a true story. As a result, theologically, the book was extremely unsound--where the individual makes its own rules, and life just keeps going and going.As far as a LOVE story--this story is amazing. Simply amazing. Pick up the book with this viewpoint and you will be amazed.From a skeptic's point of view, the work cannot be truth, from a romantic's view, it can be the tale of time. What a contradiction! That is why I gave it 3 out of 5 stars-- 5 out of 5 for the sheer writing of it--the sheer story. 3 out of 5 for the idea that it might be 'reality.' Enjoy!"
2,Unimpressive.,"The book had a great beginning, but it faded after a while. Chris Nielsen was an obnoxious man, and the writer made the characters in the story speak in ways that normal people wouldn't speak. I was disappointed. The weird, ""re-born"" thing was a terrible way to end it. All in all, the book started strong and ended up being a silly, new-age philosophy kind of thing. Unimpressive."
1,So small even a child would not wear it,I bought this for my niece it was so tiny that even a small child looked funny wearing this.
3,Pretty But Small,This is a very small pendant. I don't mind as I like petite jewelry but some people may not be happy with the size.
3,"Beautiful, but small","This pendant, and the chain it comes on are beautiful and well made, but the stone is oh-so tiny. This pendant, coupled with the matching earrings would be a nice gift for a young girl."
4,Things to consider before starting homeschooling,"I found this book enlightening and informative. We are pulling our 7 year old daughter out of the school system, who is special needs, at the end of the school year. She does not do well in the normal classroom setting. She needs flexiblity but she also needs routine. When she has a bad day, she is impossible to teach. Homeschooling allows for this. We found the book to help with our decision to homeschool. After the school district took away most of her special services due to budet cuts, we decided to do something. Homeschool is our answer. Having done this before with two older children (who loved it by the way), it was a fairly easy answer. Thanks to this book, I know that I can do it."
5,Not Alone,Kathe touches the heart of those who are going through the pain of infertility because she has been there. This is not just a book reporting what others are feeling. She captures the heartache because she has born it too. This is a good book for working through current emotions or preparing for future healing. I found the devotional chapters mirrored my own journey of emotions. I highly recommend this to anyone who has dealt with or is dealing with the pain and frustration of infertility. I would also give this as a gift to anyone struggling in this area.
1,A modest Biography of Yes,"I Began the book with much enthusiasm, but I must say I was saddened by the lack of real content. The book does share a good insight at the origins of Yes but falls short in a few areas. Mr Welch tries to convey the emotion of the music too much at times. It is very difficult to describe Yes Music since it involves pure feeling. We learn more about Yes's love affair with Vegetarian store than with the band. I had the distinct impression that Chris was trying to protect the bandmembers by not bringing up enough of their personal lives. There was also not enough work devoted to Yes in the studio. What we need is to have each bandmember right an biography of the band, then we can piece it together. David Carlin, Phila. PA"
2,Nothing New - A Limp Effort,"One would have hoped that a late-90s bio on England's best Progressive Rock band would have picked up where Dan Hedges' excellent YES (1979) left off. But Chris dropped the ball big-time.Most of the book deals with 70s Yes - in fact some of it reads like Hedges' book. But once we get into the 90125-era the author resorts solely to interviews for his material. The story drops any pretense at narrative and becomes a transcript of his interview tapes.And the period from 90125 to the present is merely glossed over; there is no depth in his writing. The reader comes away with the impression that this period is unimportant to the author, and maybe even to the band itself. Maybe that's why live Yes consists in large part of music from three 70s albums and rarely of music post-90125.Overall a lukewarm offering.Whatever happened to the book BEYOND AND BEFORE that was promised in the Yes boxed set of 1991?"
3,Interesting and informative.,"I've always respected Yes and their music. I got this biography in order to learn more about the band's long history. I find this book to be above average. I have learned much more about Yes by reading it. The author, Chris Welch, has written biographies on other musical groups, too. He's a popular music journalist in the UK. He offers many insights into the band's long history. He also has had personal contact with Yes. The photos are also interesting. The book is well-written. I give it 3.5 stars. It's well worth a read."
3,Not great!!,"There are three major flaws with this book. One, it is marred by many inaccuracies. Most of them are insignificant but it gets irritating after a while. Two, there is more about the bands personal problems and the business side to it than about the musical side. Three, there is too little information on the ""golden years"" of the band, 1972-77. Welch concentrates on the very early days. If you have read Hedges, Martin, Morse and Mosbo you will know most of the story already but Welch certainly reveals more contriversial things than they did. Personally I yawn when Welch tells about how much money they made on this or that concert. I don't care!! Having said all these negative things, I have to say though that the book is fairly entertaining. If you are a fan of the band you should buy it, since Hedges biography is out of print (I think)."
5,Unexpected,"I won't go track by track. I'll just say what I can say about only a few. You'll never find this on a Rolling Stone, Spinner, NME, etc ""Best Of"" list, but this would be on my list of ""Best Albums That You've Never Heard Of""."
1,Horrible sound,"Worst sounding phone I've ever used. When using this phone, what you hear will be good, but the person you are speaking with will have a very difficult time understanding you - the sound quality is HORRIBLE. I'm throwing mine away, and buying something that's not a G.E."
1,GE cordless phone,I do not like this phone at all. It has alot of static when I walk away from the base to another room. And it disconnects if I walk to far away. It's a piece of junk.
1,Awful!,"Do NOT, I repeat, Do NOT purchase this product. I learned the hard way. First, it comes on floppy disks and I had to have another sent to me because the first was faulty! Second, the GUI is horrible and difficult to understand. Last, and least, is that most of the submissions did NOT work. I had to go and physically do this by hand. I have learned in my experience that doing it by hand is the only reliable way. It may be tedious, but well worth it. Please, do yourself a favor and do NOT purchase this worthless product!"
2,Certainly not a money saver,"Allows you to submit your site to lots of search-engine. Claims to""boost your rankings,"" although I dont see how. My advice: Go with a free site submitter, this is not worth $."
3,so so,"I was hoping this book contained more shabby chic decorating, but it was more country. It was fun browsing thru pictures and would recommend if you are looking for more country styles."
5,Musical genius,"I absolutely love John Legend. In my eyes he can do no wrong. He reminds me of Prince in a lot of ways in his musical genius. He is incredible to watch live and he always delivers a little something extra. He keeps it just as smooth as always on this CD and I love his old school vibe, he always takes me back."
5,"Great ring, great price, but could use more sizes","The ring came quickly (shipped within CA) and looks great. However, I had to send it back because it didn't fit, but Peora handled the exchange professionally and swiftly (unfortunately they don't make the beveled ring in my size, but the rounded version of this ring that I got instead is just as nice). I just wish they offered more sizes"
4,Engrossing story of an older girl & a Protestant cult,"An unusual, entirely captivating novel that marks a neglected girl's tragic coming-of-age within the confines of a Protestant cult new to her; set in Finland and the U.K. Beautifully written, a thriller of sorts, fine reading. It's partly about the attraction of family when one has none and partly about the seduction of belonging. And, about the ultimate belonging, the ultimate seduction: motherhood."
5,Perfect,"Aesthetically pleasing and, more importantly, strong magnets! It was no fuss at all: just removed it from the box and stuck it to the fridge. The magnets are strong enough to hold the paper towels in place no matter how you pull them, but not so strong that it takes an act of Congress to move the holder."
4,Not so wrong,"Fred Hoyle is famously remembered for being wrong about the origin of he Universe. But one of the most intriguing things About Simon Mitton's book is the suggestion that he may not have been very wrong, since the math of his steady state theory matches the math of the now-fashionable inflation theory. Mitton is good at giving such unexpected insights, although he dwells a little too long on the politics of British science in the 1970s. His story of a man who went his own way through the scientific world would make a great basis for a documentary."
3,Go with Belmondo,"Japancakes stumbles on this album. It's just...blah...and this is a band that's made an art out of making blah both endearing and heartbreaking. Waking Hours certainly works as background sounds but at their best--on ""...Dallas"" and ""Belmondo"" and ""Sleepy Strange""...they managed, almost subconsciously, to pull you out of your work and yourself and force you to listen to their most ""intense"" moments.I agree with the previous reviewer: track 4 is their best offering on this album, and tracks 1 and 2 rhyme with some of their best work from previous albums. But, really, Waking Hours doesn't have the same kind of sincerity of their previous albums.(P.S. Avoid ""Down the Elements"" at all costs.)"
4,The Beloved Dearly,The Beloved Dearly is about 4 kids that start funerals for pets. Pet owners give them money and their dead pet for a funeral. The best part about this book is that one of the kid's names is Swimming Pool and she is very emotional during the funerals. This story is very humorous and is great to read. It will make you laugh.
1,Disgusting,This book makes light of a serious subject without any true aim or benefit. Shame on all of you for calling this thing good.
4,The boy who got less gready wile helping others,"This book is about a boy that is like you and me except that he wants to run a business to help his father pay for his mother's funeral. So, he found an empty lot which he made into a funeral lot to make money. Later he got clients to have funerals at the lot. He made about $10 a funeral. But he paid Swimming Pool and Dusty per funeral too. I like this book because it inspires me to not be greedy and to not expect everything to be handed to me. It also inspires me to treat people the way they need to be treated and not take things for granted."
5,"""Beloved Dearly"" is the best book I have read in years!",This book addresses children's grief issues in a personal and intimate tone. Adults and children of all ages can learn from this insightful expression of love and loss. Cooney's use of dramatic language brings color and passion to every chapter. The book is inspiring and a joy to read. I highly recommend it!
5,Cooney Blockbuster,"Doug Cooney bursts into the world of children's literature with his delightful story of love and loss. The pet funeral business is booming and characters like Swimming Pool, Ernie, and the dead bunny bring humor and warmth to his tale. Five thumbs up!"
3,It was ok,this book is about a 12 year old guy named Ernie who is a natural salesperson guy. He starts a buisiness with pet funerals...woot.This book was okay...But I just didn't like it. But that dosn't mean other people won't like it. I suggest you check it out of a library before you buy it.
4,A genuine story,"Ernie comes upon another money making sceme. With the help of Dusty, someone to decorate the ""coffins"", Tony, the hole digger, and Swimming Pool, a tomboy who can cry on cue, they start a great business for pet funerals. This story is full of exitement and suspense when some things go wrong for the team of four. A great book.... I have read it a lot!!"
4,Another Chick in Chain mail book,I stumbled onto this latest edition to the series recently. The first ones I read as soon as they came out!! I love this series!!
3,Not as good as the first one,"I did enjoy the story but felt that it would have been better to work more on moving the story and less on the little nonsensical details that fills this book.Ten years have passed since she left into exile, and now she returns to Comigor to save the soul of her husband.The ending could have been better developed and not so expected. Overall a decent book."
5,Amazing,"A few months ago, my choir had the amazing privelege of working with Penderecki himself on this fantastic piece. Since i had been under the impression that it was relitively atonal, i was simply blown away by this piece. THe way the choir and the orchestra work together is simply amazing. This is by far the best composition of the past century, and i would recommend it to anyone."
2,Extremely tiny pendant,When they say small they are not kidding . The peridot pendant was the smallest pendant I have ever seen. I would only consider buying it for the chain for the peridot is a joke..
4,"Small, but well done","The other reviewers are correct in stating that this is a very small pendant, but it is well made and quite lovely. The chain is a nice one and for the $19.00 price I paid it is a good value. I purchased the peridot and the topaz pendants and wear them together on one chain. A cute look."
5,Beautiful Necklace,"The pendant is very small. I can't remember if the description gave the dimensions, but it's no larger than an eraser tip on a pencil. However, it is gorgeous and a very high quality item."
2,Disappointed about this album!,I listened and loved just about most of the Bajofondo albums in the past. This Remixed album was totally disappointing to me. I think it's a waste of my money. None of the songs resemble the original. I am European and love the European sound but this is totally disgusting even to us! Sorry Bajofondo but next time maybe take more time to create a remix rather than hurry to put one up just because all your other albums were so popular! I will look forward to seeing more of your BEST even if I have to wait!
5,Great!!,This double pie holder has really worked well for me!! It has made my holiday baking and travels so much easier.
4,Sanctuary - 'Refuge Denied' (Epic),"First saw the light of day in 1988, as this was the second of three CD's this somewhat under-rated metal band has ever put out. What I remember the most about Sanctuary is they had maybe one video on MTV's Headbanger's Ball and Warren Dane (later of Nevermore} as lead vocalist and frontman. Even saw the band on the tour to support this very album. Tunes I dug the most here were the awesome ""Battle Angels"", ""Die For My Sins"", the band's namesake ""Nevermore"" and their cover of Airplane's ""White Rabbit"". Should indeed appeal to fans of Megadeth, Savatage, Metal Church and Testament."
1,Diarrhea,"This CD broke up my marrige, killed my dog and gave me hemorrhoids. But honestly I must say the rhythm section really cleaned my clock especialy that guitar player/song writer (Lennie).As far as the rest of the group i would rather have a Drano enema than listen for any extended amount of time."
1,"A book that falls way, way short of its promise","I have heard from a colleague that he has a version on CD that is 3 to 4 times longer than the paperback I received. A paperback which stops just prior to the arrival of the last two Bush appointees to the bench. Therefore, it (this book) falls way short of describing and/or exposing the extreme right-wing flavor of the court as it exists today. A court that is so blatantly political that it disgraces itself almost as much as the Bush Whitehouse does with alarming regularity. I expect Roe V. Wade to fall anytime now. How sad."
2,strange book,"This is not really a book about grammar; for example, if you misuse the word ""literally"" or ""penultimate"" because who don't know what it means, well, bob's your uncle, but you are not struggling with grammar. The book has a lot of examples like these, but doesn't address many of the really difficult grammatical mistakes that I make and that I hear.I am extremely surprised, for example, that the author does not mention the use of ""Fred and I"" when ""Fred and me"" should be used, in for example ""Jane played golf with Fred and me"". Strangely, the author does mention the use of ""myself"" in place of ""me"" (thus, ""Jane played golf with Fred and myself"") but seems to think people say ""myself"" because they feel it pretentious to say ""me"". I believe they say ""myself"" because they are not sure if ""me"" or ""I"" is correct. Maybe it's just I, but me hear people say ""with Fred and I"" all the time now, and it's driving I crazy, believe you myself."
5,Required Reading for All of Us,"""Our children need to 'score' better in math and science."" Whenever I hear this plaintive mantra so common in both Canada and the U.S.A. nowadays, I want to retort with a primal scream: LET THEM BECOME LITERATE FIRST! This excellent reference book belongs in every student's backpack, in every home, in every office. (In a perfect world, every English teacher would be required to memorize it.)"
1,entertainingly innacurate,"The book is entertaining, and as long as you already know the correct use of the English language, you might enjoy the read. The author presents us with a self assured ""I am right, and PLBPLBLB on those who may disagree..."" type of attitude, which would be OK if only the author was correct. But the book is full of errors and opinions, along with correct and accurate information. So, if you can sort it out yourself, you're all set. Otherwise, I'd find some more qualified authors work to base my education on."
2,Not a do-it-yourself book,A book of very expensive houses in island settings with very expensive island style furnihings. It is not at all helpful to those looking to do their own homes in an island style. The pictures are nice to dream about.
4,Well fitting,"The glasses fit well. Good all around view. The reason for the 4 star review, I think the bifocal should be a little bit lower. This is my first set of bifocals, it maybe that I haven't adjusted to wearing them yet."
4,Good Workouts - No Music,"Richard Simmons' The Stomach Formula can be difficult for beginners. Stick with it for a week, and you will not be sore at all. You may want to try doing the first seven-minute workout only during your first week or so. Each daily workout is repeated a second time on the video, and you can, if you try, work up to doing the whole thing twice.There is a different workout for each day of the week. Simmons does one set of exercises, and then repeats them. Each workout is short and to the point. Most of audio consists of instructions on the exercises. Personally, I prefer the ""Oldies"" exercise tape Simmons put out earlier."
5,Love it for 20 years!,"I've been doing this workout for 20 years. I like how there are 7 different workouts, so you don't really have a chance to get bored - I just wish Richard would convert this one to DVD, even with the out-dated outfits and hair styles!"
2,Too didactic,"I was very disappointed in this book. I appreciate some of the ideas for ways to incorporate Reiki into everyday life, such as charging household appliances with Reiki or using Reiki to separate two glasses that are stuck together. For the most part, though, it seems the authors are determined to attach a lot of rules and technical instructions to the beautifully simple practice of Reiki. For those who are into a lot of ceremony or who rely on studious planning and precise execution to strengthen their own focus, the book might be a fun or even helpful addition to a Reiki library. But it seems almost insulting to Reiki to imply that all the extra attention makes Reiki better or changes the effect that it may have. If we intend for Reiki to go for the greatest good of the recipient, it will. It's that simple."
4,So happy...,"I had this cassette tape long ago and really enjoyed it. I've been waiting for a long time for this CD to be offered on MP3... finally here and I am so very happy to be able to listen to these beautiful songs again. The ballads on this CD are so lovely. Happiness to you, ARA"
1,Dynamic pricing - crazy,"This is ridiculous. First the Krauss Ring was being sold for $13.98. And perhaps that WAS too good to be true. Then the price soared to $125 something. Now it's down to $104. But even so, it's still nearly twice as expensive as buying the actual discs (which would give CD-quality sound, booklet and art in addition to saving 3GB or so of downloading bandwidth.) Buy the CDs if you want this recording.Important: my rating refers to ""this item"" as sold on amazon not to the artistic quality of the recording itself."
4,"Give me Rings, lots of Rings!!!","I'm mad for Rings! Give me Rings. Lots of Rings. I want them all. Solti. Krauss. Furtwangler. Karajan. Keilberth. Boulez. Barenboim. Anyone else conduct one? Gimme it. I gotta have it, caress it, fondle it, make love to it, possess it, own it.I'M MAD FOR RINGS!!!!!However, on the subject of this one, if you can only have one (may the Gods forgive you) it is good. If you are looking for a vintage '50s Ring Cycle from the Holy Land (that would be Bayreuth), I would seriously suggest you search out the Testament release of the Keilberth Ring from a couple of years later. Casting is much the same, and it was recorded, but never released, by Decca. IN STEREO!!!!!Yes, the sound is primitive, though not as primative as this set. But the performance, thanks in great part to the simply astounding Astrid Varnay and her various legendary cohorts, is beyond belief.Now, in the immortal words of Wotan: Geh! GEH!! (Walkure, Act 2)."
2,it is a snoozer,"This book puts one to sleep in the first few pages.I studied at Brooklyn College and have found his books much like his teaching technique. In my opinion, both, are taught from a left wing perspective with limited useful information.This book is an example of how textbooks are probably one of the most overpriced items in the book industry. this book is worth about $9.99, if anything"
5,Perfect OEM fit for 2000 Corolla,"Check engine light came on. Plug in the OBD code reader and it said P0171 indicating fuel system running lean or rich and likely problems with O2 or MAF sensors. Took out MAF sensor (near air filter) and clean it with spray cleaner and no change. Called Toyota dealer for O2 sensor prices and learned that the 2000 Corolla has 2 sensor, one at the exhaust manifold and one near the catalytic converter. Also learned that the exhaust manifold one is the one that goes out most often.Searched online for pricing. Found on Amazon.com; which was much cheaper than the dealer and other autoparts websites. This one was the exact OEM for my car so no adapters were required. I just removed the two attachment bolts, took out the old sensor, put this one in, replaced the bolts and reset the check engine light (by removing one of the battery terminals) and problem solved. Don't recommend the slightly cheaper universal units that have adapter plates that may not work."
5,Winning Hand,"The pattern, card trick, had always fascinated me, but was never tried - not until I purchased the Winning Hand. This book proved to be extremely easy to follow, was thorough in its how to instructions, and helped me create a very enjoyable wall hanging/lap size quilt. Most patterns are not made a second time - this one will be made up several times in the future."
4,Tiny One Dog Angel,"The dog angel was of good quality. The company, All Pets Considered, shipped the angel promptly and it was wrapped well and protected in the shipping box. If you want to remember a beloved, lost pet or to honor a living one, the Tiny One Dog Angels is a good way to do it. It makes a great gift for other dog lovers."
4,Great coastal kayaking book by a great photographer,"Joel Rogers is well known in the Pacific Northwest for being an excellent photographer, with a strong interest in sea kayaking. Many kayaking calendars and rowing calendars are photographed by Rogers. He's also a decent writer. This book is quite a beautiful description, in words and Roger's excellent photos, of kayaking trips from the Seattle/Tacoma area all the way up into Western Canada, including stops at locations not usually seen by man. Quite an interesting, quintessentially Pacific Northwest travel book -- provided that travel is on the water."
5,art is neato.,this book is a great collection of established and up and coming artists interpreting classic video games. what more could you want?
3,"A good supplement to a class, but not good for self-study","The book contains problems in sequences, functions, series, integrals, asymptotics, Lebesgue measure and the Lebesgue integral, sequences of measurable functions, and iterates of transformations of an interval. The choice of problems is good, but there is no introductory exposition into the concept that is to be explored. The solutions are not explicitly developed. Sometimes, they consist of merely the answer.This text is good as a supplement to an ongoing class in graduate-level real analysis where one has access to an instructor and other students for help. Otherwise, this is not a good book for self-study."
3,McGraw-Hill's SSAT/ISEE study guide,"Really, it is 2.5 stars. I purchased this book for my 12 year old daughter so that I coud help her perform well on the SSAT. We found the content book organized, but there are multiple errors. Most of them are in calculation and some are in spelling. We found that there were not enough practice questions in the math section for the student (most often there are only 3-4 practice questions in the tougher sections). Also, they do not refer you to a page for answers, you have to flip pages and read the bold print. This just makes the answers harder to find. There were also not enough essay topics to chose from so that she could practice writing and there is only one sample essay included."
2,Inexcusable Errors,"This book has grotesque errors throughout, including in the practice tests. On practice test 1, section 4, problem #8, the numbers are vastly different from test to answer key. On the same practice test, same section, the answer to problem #14 is also incorrect (3 3/4 equals 15/4, not 13/4).On page 105 in the section entitled ""The Arithmetic You Need to Know"" Mr. Falletta explains what least common multiple is, then gives problems to complete ""on your own - least common multiple"", but the answers given are factors, not multiples.We didn't even do anything other than math. After finding the errors in practice test 1, I put the book away. It wouldn't even be fair to re-sell it. It's worthless if one can't trust the content to be accurate.It is inexcusable to have such gross errors in a book like this. It was clearly not well edited and perhaps hastily written. A huge disappointment."
1,Huge Disappointment from McGraw-Hill,"Agree with the previous reviews. I guess my wife bought this book without reading the reviews. Could add more examples in simple math errors or not well thought of. Don't seem to be typos. McGraw-Hill's should have been more careful with this type of educational materials. Funny thing is Lawrenseville's Dean wrote a forward, apparently not knowing what he's written about or for."
1,Worst Book Ever,"This book, though usefull, isnt not praticial for the begining spectroscopist. Knowing when and how to use the equations is difficult, sketch at best. I would never recomend this book to anyone unless they already know what they were doing."
1,worst one i've ever read,"I really want to write to Dr. B what inspired him to write such a ""fabulous"" book!this book's contents are messy. I am EE major and got A's on Quantum Mechanics and E&M;the biggest joke is the author said in his preface that ""......To the uninitiated ,the subject of spectroscopy seems enshrode in layers of bewildering and arbitrary notation.......Although the student may not be happy with some aspects of spectroscopy notation,itis easier to adopt the notation than to try to change long-standingspectrocopic habits.......A humorous guy! But I wonder whether the author fully understand what he wrote in this book!"
1,"Trite, college-student-like, waste of time","This book was very bad. It is not genius, clever, or even that interesting. The characters are not developed in any real way and the premise and plot situations are sophomoric and trite. This reads like a college student who had just read some philosophy and other literature decided to write a novel based on what he'd just learned. Had Ruff just read Ayn Rand before he wrote this? There's really no excuse for using her as a character in this book. It's unfair to and not even funny.This book was a waste of time and my whole book group agreed. It just made us angry. I advise you to use your time more wisely to read something worthwhile. I can't believe this got published.Is it possible to give negative stars as a rating?"
4,Spiritual Warfare At Its Best,"Once again, Sharon Ewell Foster has managed to captivate her readers, this time through the disparate lives of Shirley and Sheri. This book completely held my attention as I sought to understand Shirley now by learning (in flashback) about Shirley as a child. Not since Frank Peretti's This Present Darkness and Piercing The Darkness have I seen spiritual warfare so chillingly depicted in a work of fiction.My only problem with the book was that it had a cliffhanger ending! Now I have to wait until the sequel comes out to get the rest of Shirley's saga.Kudos to Ms. Foster for not being afraid to write from the depths of her soul and for not shying away from what some would consider to be a controversial departure from the easier style of her first two books. I can't wait until the sequel comes out!"
4,The Ironic Dr. Kildare,"""Critical Care"" has Dooling's first and perhaps best novel. It contains his usual blend of medical and legal background themes leavened with his acerbic humor.Unlike his previous novel (""Brain Storm"") this is story is based more on the medical theme and less the legal. The story is about the ethical choices a doctor working in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) has to make. Doolings style is good, and his ironic descriptions are precious. Yet the book is serious, I'm thinking seriously about a living will after having read this.One failing I am beginning to find, is that the author only has one character. The doctor in this story is too similar to the lawyer in ""Brain Storm"" and the Indiana insurance adjuster in ""White Man's Grave"".Recommended for those who would like to read about an ironic Dr. Kildare."
5,One of my all-time favorites,"I work in the medical field, and I can tell you that this book is based on truth. I have read all of Mr. Dooling's books, after discovering this one first. I've bought this book for at least five people as gifts.Reading this book, I SO wanted to crawl into the plot as one of the ICU nurses, preferably another Stella. Then the ending sneaks up on you, and it isn't at all what I expected, but in a good way. I re-read this book at least once every year. Thank you, Mr. Dooling, for the entertainment and for surprising me and making me think at the end. I'm sure I'm not the only reader who would like to hear more from Werner."
2,Stick with Leanne's later stuff,"Citified heiress Felicity travels to Texas to the ranch of her silent partner Brock Logan after her financial planner absconds with her fortune. Brock is not thrilled to have a pampered heiress staying on his ranch, but comes to find she is not so pampered after all. Soon, she finds herself falling for Brock and his children.In my quest to read all things Leanne Banks, after falling in love with her Bellagio series, I came upon what can only be described as yet another ""virgin deflowered by a sexy cowboy"" story. It is an okay story, but not really fully developed, has clunky dialogue, and is a little cliched. Better to stick to her later romantic offerings."
3,Her Forever Man...,I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It was an easy-read with a story line that moved quickly.The relationships between Felicity and Brock and Felicity and his children were well-developed and believable. The added twist of the Logan curse helped to enhance the story. I would have liked a little more detail about the foundation that was set up.I also enjoy that this is part one of a series (Lone Star Families). I am looking forward to reading the next two books when I suspect I'll find out more about Felicity and Brock as well as Tyler and Martina!
3,This old English is some time difficult to follow.,"The books subject is very interesting. It converges all other belives in transdendental matter. It is the common denominator of them all.But it must be said that the narrative is a little difficult to follow. The ""teller"" is clearly from the last century.That's all - Thank you."
4,Henry Lee Comes a Long Way from Lucifers!,"My boy, Henry, sure has come a long way from the days he sang at Lucifer's...a local disco. He was ""hot"" then, but he's HOT now! Keep on rockin' Henry...you're my low flyin' man. Buy this disc."
4,If you LOVE Tommy Castro and blues/rock... buy this album,"If you love blues-rock, Henry Lee Summer will not steer you wrong. The guy has been going strong for quite some time and has cranked out 5 albums: 1) self titled 2)I've Got Everything 3)Way Past Midnight 4)Slamdunk and this year 5)Smoke & Shadows. I first saw this guy open for Chicago at the Concord Pavilion in '89... he put on a hell of a show and I bought the album within the week."
1,This phone is no good. Dont bother.,"I ordered this phone, and it worked fine for about a month, then mysteriously died. Now when the phone rings, I cant answer it, and if I pick up the phone to make a call, it gives one beep, and thats it. No button works.Keep in mind that that it was only about 1 month, so it couldn't have been the battery.Get another phone. Skip this one."
1,so cheap,"i picked this bc in the photo, the material looks like a smooth velvet. it's not, it's thin crushed velvet and it's not as blue as pictured. we ended up throwing it away and i sewed a costume for my daughter instead."
1,Not Happy,"This costume was purchased for my grandaughters birthday party (princess themed.) Before two hours had passed the sleeves had shredded from the bodice. I realize that shear material has a tendencies to do this, but I think the costume was falling apart to soon."
2,witty,"a fairly entry level video, i found the commentary witty in its ineptitude. the lessons are great, but man, this really is a case of a presenter who makes a good belly dancer. having paid for the tape, i watch it a good deal, but perhaps i should have shopped around. on the positive side, i now belly dance like a pro."
1,Useless,"The poor quality of the video itself has made it impossible for me to enjoy the video, the sound quality and visual quality are simply atrocious. Because of that all else about the video is irrelevant. If one can not see nor hear an instruction video properly then it is useless."
3,Beginning dance,"This video is fine for dance instruction, even though it leaves out how to understand the basic count of Arabic rhythms, and hand movements are avoided all together. It explains enough that the novice gets the idea. fine for someone who has never been exposed to bellydance."
2,New to belly dance,"I am new to belly dance and decided to purchase a few videos. I got the sensual art of belly dance with Neena and Veena, and the two Ancient Art of Oriental Belly dancing.I found it difficult to follow along. Being new to belly dance I have a hard enough time learning the moves and what was harder was that she had finger cymbals, so I got thrown off beat and a bit confused.I hurt my muscles in one of the knee bend exercises, and there hadn't been a warning or anything, so be advised the warm ups aren't all easy... let alone safe.I believe it would probably be better had I known some belly dancing before this video. It seemed like something for intermediate, not beginner like me... or perhaps it just wasn't explained properly. Take into account the bellydancing looks great, but it is difficult to folow with the movie, so you may have to rewind several times before you get the moves... at least I did."
3,"Good dance video for beginner, spectacular dance preformance",It was my very first Belly dance video I ever owned. The preformance at the beginning is spectacular and feel that the instruction is great for the beginner. It was an inspiration for me and now my neice and are are in a belly dance troup.
3,Good Instructional Intro to Belly Dancing,"I bought this for my granddaughter. The format of the tape is good. The instructor does a good job of explaining step by step what she is doing. The only complaint I have is that the sound is garbled, like the tape is old. I would like an updated version."
1,Don't expect a whole lot...,"This video is not terrible, however the videography, editing, sound, and tape quality is so bad that it interferes with the entire experience. (Analog VHS) Though it is dated in the late 80s, I would guess that it was made somewhat earlier. The exercises appear good (haven't tried them yet) however the instruction is somewhat minimal. It is not really an excerise tape in that it doesn't lead you through a routine. The instructor only gives you directions on HOW to DO the excercises. I must say that I was fairly amused by the ineptitude (as another reviewer mentioned)of the whole performance/filming. The excercise costumes are quite bizarre as well. The one good thing I can say is that Alexandra puts the moves into little mini dances that are helpful in seeing how everything can fit together. However, I personally will be shopping around for another tape..."
3,first section was good,I liked her performance in the beginning of the tape and was very excited that I was able to follow along in the first intructional section but the second section on veil dancing I found to be very boring. The instructor never had you put together a routine of what you learned. I am guessing she wants you to buy the next tape which didn't get as good a review as this one.
3,A Mixed Bag,"This is an adequate starting video...provided you've had any prior dance training (not necessarily oriental dance!) and have a little familiarity with terminology, technique etc.Here are some good points: Alexandra King approaches movement by emphasizing music. Then she groups dance movements according to what's performed to a specific rhythm. When she goes into detail about a move, it's usually very carefully explained and demonstrated. Also, the price is right.However she appears uncomfortably conscious of the camera. Also, the below-average production values detract from the information. The audio is particularly annoying...her body mike picks up extra noise, someone off-camera obviously starts/stops music that's too loud etc.In short, it's okay for the price."
3,"cute, especially for boys","This is a cute book that will appeal especially to boys. It is supposed to have a cd with a rap,but mine did not come with one."
1,Don't Buy This Book!,"This strategy guide is useful up to a point, but becomes too garbled up and totally useless in the end! Hard to understand would be the better way to explain it! Not worth the money! The game is hard enough to tackle, but this so-called strategy guide makes it worse!"
4,wonderful book,"i was curious to see whether canadian quilts would be recognisably different from american quilts. while i'm not sure i could identify a quilt as canadian after reading this book, i did find the quilts beautiful, and beautifully photographed (i liked the scrap quilt shown with a 1930s touring car--clever pairing). the text is frequently fascinating, with interesting tidbits about 19th canadian life (i had the urge to kiss my central heating), but the author does indulge in a bit too much speculation about some quilts.the quilts range from 1827 to 1990. according to the author, most are privately owned and had not been previously photographed. they are grouped in chapters by style, and i particulary liked the chapter on summer quilts. there is certainly a wealth of design ideas, whether patchwork or applique, or quilting designs."
4,Not just about the food,"This book has made me look at food and the other issues you may have that effect why and what we eat. I started looking at a broader array of foods that are out there, and started eliminating some of the really unhealthy items that I see I was consuming for emotional reason, not nutritional needs. It's a cook book with feelings."
5,This book has given to me for over 20 years.,I have owned this book for over twenty years and I use it all of the time. I use the recipes over and over and read through the inspiring summaries and exercises about once a year and it always reminds me why I love eating this way. It is written in a very sweet and nurturing way. I have given this book to many friends over the years.
5,"macrobiotics made easy, find balance with real food","I went to an accupuncturist who diagnosed me as having an imbalance in my yin/yang. It was a whole new way of thinking for me. I thought I had a pretty wholesome diet until I learned about extreme foods. From page one, I loved this book. It helped me understand macrobiotics and the whole yin/yang foods thing. This book explains in a simple and warm tone about expansive and contractive foods, cravings, and the accumulation of toxins from extreme, or high stress foods. The author lays out useful charts that you refer to again and again in makeing food choices that are more natural and balanced,which brings you more into balance. I have been feeling really good since I've made the shift to eating more neutral foods."
5,Excellent Introduction to Macrobiotics,"For those interested in macrobiotics, I recommend this book. In addition to recipies, the book is packed with easy to understand information on macrobiotics and offers helpful suggestions and easy ""experiments"" with food. The authour is encouraging, and suggests keeping a journal. The information she presents will answer a lot of ""why"" questions and she offers a comphrensive explaination of the nutritional value of foods in the macrobiotic diet. I discovered macrobiotics when my own daughter was ill with kidney ailments. This was one of the first books I was intorduced to and 4 years later still refer back to it. It is light and enjoyable reading and a great starting point."
5,"If I could only keep 3 books, this would be one of them.","This book was suggested to me by an herbalist and acupuncturist several years ago, when charting new eating habits. I have refered often to it & recommend frequently to friends who are new to non-Western approaches to health &/or have wondered if any non-trendy, serious books exist that introduce one to the larger picture of healthy eating and patterns, in a fun & easy to understand manner. A wonderful resource!"
5,greatest book ever!,"Greatest book ever, so helpful for someone who needs to learn how to eat a healthy, restrictive diet for the rest of my life."
3,"Ok, but not great......","Was a little disappointed, this was really more for a vegetarian point of view. However, it has some good ideas and great information to help with diet and lifestyle change."
1,Badly Organized and Incomplete,"This book is terrible. It does not cover many of the tools. For instance, at the beginning of the book it mentions that a new tool is ""Object Remover"", supposedly to remove objects you dont want in a picture. That is the last you hear of it, it's never mentioned again, and no hint as to how to use it. The major tools are covered (sometimes in several sections), but many other tools are listed at the beginning of the chapter, then never mentioned. I'm sorry I bought it and will try another book (Perhaps Paint Shop Pro X Digital darkroom by Clark)."
2,Not much happening here,"endless noodling of trivial melodies(take the beginning of ""Wichita Lineman""), good for humming - if this is what you expect from jazz. Hardly leaves the safe haven of schlager tonality. We had all this hundred of times (only better) from Keith Jarrett and all the ECM pianists of the last three decades. Redundant."
1,very disappointed,"I used gift cards from family to purchase this ring. I had it on for one day & the Citrine stone fell out. I just think the quality of this ring is poor, rough edges on the gold, and stones that were not set right."
3,What was expected,The mounting Hardware Kit fits on the sonar. Now all I have to do is stick it on the boat and my fishfinder is sort of portable. I can use it on the boat at the cottage or take it with me and the smaller boat to the nearby lakes. Trout season opens next weekend.
5,An Homage To Patchen,This is a work of much labor that obviously went straight to the sources for information and really investigated the history that prompted such powerful poetry and fiction. Patchen is a heroic example of a person who maintained his pacifist stance when the world around him was exploding and brought his beautiful vision to Earth. This biography is written with a kind of tenderness and honesty that Patchen valued above all else. Thanks Larry Smith for this labor of love.
2,Patchen deserves better...,"As I've written elsewhere (in Rain Taxi, a review of books, to be exact), Smith's biography hardly does justice to the memory of poet Kenneth Patchen. Besides claiming Baudelaire is a Spanish poet(!), Smith practically ignores Patchen's energetic, highly individual work in favor of detailing the poet's politics and undeniably painful medical history, which is not how any poet of Pathcen's talents would want to be remembered. What's more unfortunate than Patchen's record of ill health is that his poetry and novels and art continue to be overlooked after his death - just as they were during his difficult life. If ever an American poet deserved critical reconsideration, it's Mr. Kenneth Patchen. Before you spend your good money on this self-published socio-political diatribe, please purchase every Patchen book that remains in print. Then buy second copies to give as gifts. Fans of e.e. cummings, one of Patchen's many writerly pals, should really enjoy Patchen's work."
3,No color...baaaad.,"I agree with the other reviewer in that the lack of color is a huge detriment to an otherwise pretty good book. I grew up in the 1960s and the family traveled to South Florida every year...I mostly remember the Sunshine State amd its attractions to be big and really colorful. Most of the photograghy in this book seems shrunk down and lacks detail. Countless times I found myself squinting and wishing the photos were bigger and in color. The book is informative and there are plenty of illustrations, but alas just ""OK"" because of all that darn B&W."
3,Why all the black and white?,This is an excellent resource of information on old roadside attractions but what a disappointment the visuals are. Half of the fun is seeing these places in color yet except for an 8 page section in the center all the rest of the book is small b/w photos of things you know had to be from color sources. It spoils an otherwise excellent resource.
3,No color pictures,"This would be a fantastic book if the pictures were in color, but they are not. Just black and white. What a disappointment! It is still worth getting."
1,Thoroughly disappointed.,"Having just finished and been mesmerized by ""The Emperor's Children"", I had high hopes for delving into Claire Messud's earlier works. This book just fails to engage me on any level, and I tried - truly, gave it about 150 pages worth of trying, but was tempted to leave it in the seat pocket of my flight home last night."
1,Well written and dull. So what's new?,Massud is a fine stylist but the architecture of her book is shakey. I look forward to her next effort to see if the narrative and the characters will match her considerable writing skills.
2,i no finish dis book,"because it samey-same: de obligatory ""MFA"" style of writing where every noun get adjective and writer strain to write mellifluously--like de master William Boyd or Martin Amis. dis book much much too studied and contrived. very much de self-indulgent style writing here and de characters not engaging in de least! you can trust me mon i love Flaubert and Conrad and de Kingsly Amis and de George Eliot--i like de good books! dats why i no likee dis one!"
3,Washes over the reader as a series of experiences,"Perhaps this is a novel more for women. Like a slice of life, a series of experiences do not necessarily equal a plot. I found the characters interesting enough to keep reading, but had to wade through parts where Sagesse was being philosophical. She grossed me out with all the oozing boils on her back. Why wasn't her mother taking her to a doctor? Much of this story seemed a consequence of neglect or unwise love. Certainly, no one prayed to God to help them through their anxieties. Even though he was practically a vegetable, brother Etienne seemed one of the most refreshing characters. Everyone else seemed neurotic. The setting in Algeria was interesting. The idea of being an alien in your own county provokes thought. But as much of this novel as is devoted to this girl's virginity, one would think she could at least have a little more fun losing it. Maybe you have to be a woman to get this book. It was okay."
1,Knockout...I'm still sleeping,"This is a wonderful book about what happens when the great niece of Albert Camus seduces her MFA professor at Amherst. Full of warm-hearted sketches of peasant life in New York and Boston, Messud takes us on a whirlwind tour of borrowed literary devices. There's not one laugh in the book, either. That would detract from the delicate mood. Messud makes sensuous love to her characters as sweet aromas gently waft across the pages. She is a true artisan of the well-made nothing. This book may not appeal to men or women, but others will rejoice."
4,Beuatifully written,"The beginning of this novel was slow, but once it gained its momentum, there was no going back. Claire Messud writes so beautifully, with such incredible descriptions, that it's hard not to get drawn in to the life of Sagesse, the main character. Sagesse is a complicated young woman in a complicated family. Messud does a great job of exploring a a young woman's adolescence and all the emotions that go along with it. I felt like I was an observer of Sagesse and her family in this little French town, and when a book makes me feel like I'm actually there, I know it has achieved something great."
4,"disturbing, sad, powerful","This is a pretty bleak novel, so don't expect any happy endings, of anything like that. And it takes a bit of getting into. But if you stay with it, you'll be transformed by it -- beautiful language, a beautiful story (set in France and Algiers). I'm telling everyone about it at the moment."
2,metonymic overkill,"I suppose there is some dramatic action to this novel -- we do have the obligatory scandal and ensuing suicide. And yet the writing feels static, as if it can't move forward. Perhaps that sense is due to the writer's belabored prose. There's an inappropriate metaphor or simile every other sentence. (I can't believe she uses the adjective metonymic twice. Obviously she spent too much time in graduate school.) And also is due to the long and often repeated authorial lectures on the pains of adolescence, exile, and the hopes of Camus and Augustine for a free Algeria. For her, Algeria is a pretext, a prop, which she gets to use without really doing anything. It's all a bit much in this contrived paint-by-the-numbers literary product that appears to have been written primarily to further a career. At this, Messud, judging by her current bestsellerdom, has apparently succeeded brilliantly."
4,"Sometimes heavy-going, ultimately very rewarding","I started this book with excitement, having been a fan of Messud's last novel, When The World Was Steady. It's much more deep and rich than the first book, but that also brings some problems, I thought. Sometimes, the narrator is too wordy for me -- made me think of those Henry James novels I never could finish. But stick with it! The story is so beautiful, the characters so real, and France, the South of France, is completely alive in colors, like Matisse and Picasso. It is lovely at the end."
4,Intoxicating and Disturbing,"This is not a fast read, based not only on the length of the novel, but the emotional depths to which Messud brings her readers. Filled with devastating truths on what it is to be human, Messud demonstrates her grasp of a myriad of characters and places. She brings to life not only France and Algeria, but holds mirror up to what is American as well. A beautiful, yet challenging and disturbing book."
2,If only it were all in Algeria,"Everything outside of the Algerian flashbacks were overwritten and pretentious. I'm deeply disturbed by the praise here; it spells dooms for the future of literature, I'm afraid. I suppose all one has to do is write unnecessarily wordy sentences and throw Camus' name around forty or so times, and a genius is born.I didn't buy it."
3,well written,"Easy read, not compelling or complex but informative about Algerian/French nationals who were displaced by politics..I had heard so much about Claire Messud, I suppose I expected more."
4,informative book,"Whether you agree with him or not, Morton Smith has something to say. In this book you might learn not only about what Jesus contemporaries probably thought of him, but also about the concept of magic and how ancient people understood it. For example, why do magicians sometimes seem to cast a spell by a long and time-consuming procedure while at other times they do it with a single word? Smith answers this question. (Hint: why do computer programmers sometimes write code for hours while at other times they launch a program with one key stroke? Basically the same answer to both quetstions.)My only major criticism of this book is that Smith never answers the question ""what, if any, difference is there between religion and magic?"" Even though he must have an answer to this, he never makes it clear."
4,GREAT RECOVERY DRINK!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased this about a month ago and it is an amazing recovery drink, but Cellmass by itself not stacked with the other BSN products is not as effective as a pure creatine like I have taken previously. On a side note I was only taking this after a workout instead after a workout and at bedtime like is recommended, I probably would have had better success with this if I had but I have switched to Optimum nutrition 100% micronized creatine monohydrate. If you do not like the bloated look or feel then this is for you."
4,Worth the money!,"Definitely worth the money. I take it twice a day: immediately after workouts and 6-8 hours later like the suggested serving calls for. Felt results in a bout a week, bigger & stronger muscles and a little more endurance."
3,Glorified Creatine,"For the price, not worth. Monohydrate creatine is all people need. If you feel bloated DRINK MORE WATER! Drink 2 gallons+ a day. You need to when on creatine.If I were to waste money on this product. It would be only during the cutting phase of bodybuilding.It tastes good though, so I gave it an extra star.Buy some Monohydrate (no taste) and grape juice."
4,Improvments,"Its a great product, besides the fact that the taste of it is a little strong for me. price is a little high too"
4,Good Product but read first,"This is a good product because it has nutrients your body needs after a hard workout. I took it for a month as a bookend with BSN no xplode. I had great gains for that month, but I have stopped taking it because when I took Cell Mass too late in the day, I had trouble falling asleep at night. If I was able to work out earlier in the day, I would definitely still be taking Cell Mass."
3,didn't work for me,"This is my first creatine product and was quite excited to find the ethyl ester version instead of the monohydrate which I'd heard gave some digestive issues. Anyway, seemed to dissolve really well had a pleasant enough taste but felt it did nothing for me in improving my energy level during workouts. Hope it works for you..."
5,Awesome Recovery Product,"I don't go to the gym unless I'm going hard. By the time I'm done with my work outs, I want to ache. I want to know what I'm doing is working for my body. The cellmass creatine is good quality creatine and is packed with other nutrients that are key to muscle recovery and repair.I always take creatine after my workout since the body is in total absorption mode at that point. Before hand, I take a test booster and l-arginine -Pro-Player Elite - Male Enhancement Formula + FREE L-Arginine (Nitric Oxide Booster) 250 Grams.The PPE and L-arginine help produce more nitric oxide so you're able to pump better when you're weightlifting. There's a dramatic difference. They keep me from feeling fatigued during my workout and the taking the Cellmass with it makes for the ultimate combination. I swear by this routine and have turned a lot of my buddies onto it as well."
4,Good Product,"I am 5'8"" and medium to slender build. I take this to recover and to build muscle for toning, not to get bigger. So I take it once a night but at half dose. It helps recovery and adds muscle.I would also highly suggest Muscle Milk's Twitch. The non-caffeinated version. I bought Twitch and was amazed. My friend didn't believe me until I brought mine into work for him to try. He bought his own two days later. I squeeze lime wedges into these products and add ice. It tastes great."
5,Cellmass will noticeably reduce muscle soreness,"Cellmass is awesome stuff and actually tastes really good. I've used several types of creatine products (GNC, MuscleTech, etc.) and this one is definitely my favorite. I use it every day, and if I do a particularly grueling workout, I'll make sure to take an extra dose right after to reduce soreness and speed up recovery. It seriously works. BSN is an all-around high quality supplement company. I would never hesitate to purchase their products."
4,Good to those looking to GAIN muscle and weight,"I typed ""Gain"" with uppercases because this is not a product for those trying to lose some weight or trying to get the 6-Pack. This product is meant to be used by hard-gainers looking to add a couple of inches in muscles.Flavor is great (I bought strawberry). BSN knows how to create good-tasting products, which is something that I don't seem to find with Optimum Nutrition.The bad thing? Serving size is 3 rounded scopes! You'll be pretty full-up after drinking your shake. That's for sure. As I said before, this is not a product for those looking to lose weight."
1,CELL MASS,"The side effects caused by Cell Mass are reason enough not to use it. (Diarrhea- Digestion problems- headaches)and no real recovery benefits as far as I could tell. Cell Mass is a scam.Save your money.I use Optimum BCAA 5000 powder-L-glutamine-HMB A good multivitamin and Whey ""gold Standard ""protein powder. This works much better with no side effects. 6x 480 balanced calorie meals per day I'm seeing more gains without the harsh side efects! Same recovery time!!"
1,Wrong product!!!,"I have heard great things about the product (Cellmass). However, I received a nice big container of NO-Xplode, which is clearly not Cellmass.....this was my first negative experience through Amazon. I had to call customer service, get a return receipt label, take my time to go to the post office and mail the N0-Xplode back, and wait for my refund so I can give the Cellmass order another attempt.Wish me luck!!"
3,creatine,This product is ok. Didn't see a whole lot of strenth improvment but it does speed up revory between sets and days.All in all not bad but nothin to write home to mom about.
4,cellmass,"my recovery time has been greatly reduced, and not nearly as sore without it.I would definately reccomend this product to anyone."
2,not creatine monohydrate,"I bought this under the impression that it was creatine monohydrate. It is creatine, but the less proven creatine ethyl ester. I'm no cellular biologist, but I think tried and true creatine monohydrate works better for bulking phases of bodybuilding."
5,"Good product, great workouts!","I appreciate Cellmass when I run out of it and buy more, because when I don't have it I can feel the difference."
2,It didn't work,"I just wanted to write to say that the video set we received, there was one that we couldn't even watch because it was so messed up. The whistling in the beginning of the tape didn't even sound like the ones on the real show. I would have to say thumbs down to this one."
1,Very Poor Quality,"These videos are of very poor quality. The music is not the Andy Griffith Show theme song, which was very distracting. The videos are grainy and appear to be taped from a tape. A big disappointment. I would not recommend this product."
4,*sigh*,"I adored the previous books in this series, and loved Ptolemy's Gate up until the end, which COMPLETELY spoiled the book, for me at least. I was reduced to helpless rage, hiding the book in my closet and stalking off to complain. It was an unfortunate letdown. I absolutely loathe books that kill off the main character at the ending, even if there seems to be no hope of escape, I would rather have a shoddy ending than have the main character killed off. However, it did eventually occurr to me that perhaps it was better this way, and, in the likeness to Ptolemy, brought the book off well. Still, this minor subduing did not entirely quell the anger and disgust at the end of the book. I'm not saying that the book as a whole was bad- if you skip the ending, then well, it was a superb book. But all in all, I wish I hadn't read it. Leaving it off at the second book would have been much preferred. Still, 4 stars, excellant writing."
4,A Brutal End (spoiler),"Many readers seem to be angry at the author for the killing (or really sacrifice) of Nathaniel at the end, but others seem to have no problem (including critics). It is a crucial life lessons that one is never to young to learn, yet a consolation prize for Nathaniel's demise is his shedding of the name John Mandrake and the bond that develops between him and Kitty (not to mention Bartimeaus). All in all a good ending to a fantastic trilogy."
5,Surpasses first two books and pulls whole story together,"I thought this would just be another chronology of the adventures of John Mandrake , Bartimaeus, and Kitty. Mandrake would be an arrogant politician. Kitty would be an anarchist. Bartimaeus would provide comic relief. Boy, was I wrong. The characters matured, faced difficult decisions, and had to display true courage and altruism. Sure, Bartimaeus is as wise-cracking as ever and Mandrake begins the book as clueless about commoners as before. But I was truly impressed with how the sum of the story lines added up to more than 100%."
4,"I loved the last book, it wrapped up swell","When it started I was a little put off by the whole weakness thing Bartimaeus was going through. But as the book progressed it became so good I forgave the author of every cliche that he put in the book, mostly about the Kitty/Nathanial thing.Everything from the first two books is cleared up nicely here, leaving no holes, but still enough vaguyness to make you read it twice, which I have done. Several times.I would normally tell you the unbelievable, really perfectly awesome, magnifecent, wraps up the trilogy excellently ending, but then people would get mad at me, mainly because they probably won't agree. I guess the ending is sorta sad...Always remember you're unique, just like everyone else.-This quote came from an email i got."
4,Great Ending- the best ever :),"Well, the ending to this book really made me love it. Although this series hasn't been my fav of all times, it does rate in the top 5 or so. I really enjoyed reading this book because of the twists and turns, although I have read some better books (Eragon/Eldest- my favorites). But the ending to this book made it all worth it. As I finished it, I sat there in shock and in admiration of how it all ended so perfectly together. I actually had to reread it (the last two pages) about 4 times before I was satisfied. Honestly, this was the BEST ENDING I have ever read in a book (most are predictable/boring/not what you wanted).Overall I recommend, if for no other reason than the terrific ending!"
4,Unique fantasy,"Unique because the fantasy is not so absurd, it contains also a description of society, rare in fantasy litterature. Wonderfully written. A disappointing end...Felix, 17"
3,**SPOILER**,"Loved the books, but why must the main character be sacrificed in the best of these fantasy trilogies? Remember Lowry's Giver, Gathering Blue and Messenger? Makes me concerned for Eragon in the upcoming Inheritance! It's not 19th century Russian lit - - I want a happy ending!"
5,Just what we needed,"Fast shipping. Refinished a computer armoire in espresso, and the brushed nickel hinges look great. Bonus felt bumper pads included with hinges."
1,Very dissapointed I almost could not read any more,"I really enjoyed the first book then the second one I was really dissapointed in and then this one is just awful. The story is so long and boring and nothing happends till half way through the book. I enjoyed Kitty's part in it but then it got boring, Nathaneil's part was boring and Bartimaeus was boring alos. The nding was good and it wrapped up good but it's not worth the time and day. I was really dissapointed in it."
1,There's no (or not much) decency in publishing,"We need a moratorium on sequels. Publishers are obviously not inclined towards such decency, but perhaps retailers like Amazon could make this happen by refusing to carry sequels. Another misguided hope.The author himself appears tired of his characters, the endless footnoting just seems a gimmick that the author cannot escape from. Everyone sees the light and everything turns out right, of course.The real world and the one where Bartimaeus ordinarily lives are supposed to be symmetric, but making things completely symmetric wouldn't serve the author's cliched purposes, so its only symmetric whenever it suits.Save your money. Borrow it from your public library if you feel you must read the last part."
3,meh...,"I fell in love with the vibrant character of Bartimaeus right from the start. I basically inhaled the first two books. The third however didn't live up to the standards of the series for me. Although there were some scenes which I found very satisfying, there were also times when the reading became tedious and outright boring.All in all, it would have been okay, but then came the ending. It was so abrupt, without much explanation and leaving many loose ends. I wouldn't have minded having the main character killed off in dramatic powerful way, going out with a big bang, but this hardly did this series justice. It seemed as if the author just got tired of writing.In the previous instalments, the story gained so much momentum, this book seemed a mite deflated and I felt short changed.Although still worth reading, I was expecting more from Stroud."
1,Here's what You really get!,"Here's what you really get; if you can get through a nightmare install (I had to call tech-support just to get it to install); A low-grade version of IBM's Via Voice technology (probably a freely available version), Microsoft's freely available Agent technology using Robby The Robot to speak to you, and a bunch of worthless Learning Games that don't teach anything but a few basic words you probably already know, and are more anoying than engaging. Voice translation is crap since your using a rudimentary ViaVoice version and the translation is rudimentary and not fully accurate (no conjugated verbs here of course). And if you want to translate web pages forget this software, try a FREE plug-in from Altavista for Internet Explorer called Babel Fish (INSERT THE URL!) instead of wasting money on this junk software. Instant Spanish 2000 is really just a bunch of other companies basic technology patched together to look like an original program. (INSERT SPITEFUL REMARK!)"
1,not worth any amount of money,"this product is garbage, I bought it to learn spanish for a vaction I was taking. I learned nothing from it. It is difficult to use and does not work well on windows computers."
1,Instant Spanish? Yea Right,"Instant Spanish? Yea Right. I have this one and the German program both are total junk, don't waste your money, buy a dictionary or take a college class or something but this is one to not buy. I used it for school and it messed me up, I learned nothing from using it."
1,buy a dictionary! save your money!,"this program is garbage, it does not work al all. I also own Language Forces Universal Translator, and that is also garbage that dont work, this company puts out inferior software products. If you buy a good dictionary you would save a lot of money and be better off."
1,I was not happy,"I was not happy with this. I got it to try and converse with spanish speaking people. After using this thing for a month I was unable to say much. I went out and even bought the Univeral Translator 2000 that the same company makes. Big mistake for me. all this thing does is translate my money into their pocket, other than that it was not useful at all. It did not work like it is claims to on their box. I could not get this thing to translate 1 simple sentence. I uninstalled it and returned it. After having to fix my copy of Microsoft Word 97 that the language translator messed up on me. It claims to work fine with Word 97, my copy of Word was so messed up I had to uninstall it, and reinstall it twice. I did not find either program helpful to me in learning spainsh, I bought a great dictionary and spanish for idots books and I am learning so much more than with this software. The books are better. Much better."
2,For serious students and balletomanes only,"I have no disagreement with Ms. Lin's thoughtful review, but would add that not only is this important document in black-and-white, but both video and audio are seriously degraded; it can be quite painful to try to watch. You would certainly not want to have this as your only version of Sleeping Beauty."
5,the sleeping beauty,"In spite of what other people may think, in my oppinion, this is a very good dvd.It is very old,andtechnology wansn't then what it is now.Leaving that apart, where else can you see Margot Fonteyn dancing her most famous role?.Nobody has equal let alone surpass her in that role.Forget the technology and concentrate in the beauty of her dancing."
1,Totally creapy.,"This is supposed to be an educational movie on the skeleton. However, it's more of a history of how people throughout time have been scared of the skeleton. It talks about Tarot cards, and is spooky from beginning to end. I'm actually throwing it away."
2,A missed chance,Having read the book first I really looked forward to the movie as a chance to dispel some of the strange ideas we have about Soviet sailors and to shed a little light on a very shadowy place in the worlds militaries.This chance was missed however by skimming over the cause of the events and failing to show the almost superhuman efforts the Rissian captain and crew went through to save the situation. Rutger Hauers performance as a consumate submariner and commanding officer are as close to reality as this movie comes. Surely a missed chance.
3,I was interested..,"I was interested throughout the movie. I thought it was going to be worse. I got it, like many, because of Dominic Monaghan. Though he's not in it much, he's always around. He has one line, but from the review I read I thought that was it. He's actually in it more than you would think! It's a good movie none the less. Ahh go away + buy it!"
4,Courage Under Water,"I can't speak to the historical accuracy of the events depicted but the staging seemed very realistic and plausable. Considering they had to make this film on a ""TV Movie"" budget, I think they did quite well. Rutger Hauer gives an excellent performance as the Russian submarine captain. If you liked Crimson Tide and Hunt for Red October, then you should add Hostile Waters to your library of under water drama, too."
2,Take it or leave it,"This movie wasn't bad, but it was by no means great. I found it quite difficult to follow the storyline, and the special effects were less than convincing (is it just me, or did they use the exact same shot of the Russian submarine, like, 5 times?) Some of the acting, Sheen and Hauer included, seemed forced.The first 45 minutes of the movie were nearly unbearable, but towards the end, the pace picked up and it became more interesting. I even enjoyed the ending.(Note: If you are buying this movie for the performance of Dominic Monaghan [as I admit I did], don't waste your money on it. He is hardly shown and has ONE line. Just a heads-up)"
3,I Bought It For Dom!,"I ordered this DVD for Dominic Monaghan's performance. He is not in it very much, at all, but this was an okay movie.It is the story of a US sub and a USSR sub involved in an accident which the US gov't. denied ever happened.Suddenly the USSR's sub is in danger of blowing up the Eastern Seaboard of the US, but they have a limited amount of time and oxygen.The rest of the movie is their attempt to save themselves and shut off the reactors so the nuclear bombs don't explode.The acting is so-so; I would expect better from Sheen and Hauer. I can imagine that this was just a little film that they did in their downtime.Dom, as Sasha, is good considering he has like, 3 lines. As always, his facial expressions and eyes convey more than the average actor.If you are a Dom fan, there's no harm in getting this movie. I've only watched it once, whereas I have watched ""Hetty"" at least 5 times all the way through. Not a movie worthy of an award, it's a pretty interesting flick."
2,Hardly Serviceable,"Little more than a serviceable introduction to the historical proceedings. Wooden acting all round. In fact, Sheen looks like he's sleepwalking (or punchdrunk) through the thing. Still, Hauer does manage to conjure some sympathy as the Russian captain who does his best to save all his men, though, regardless of what he does, he can't win back home with the Soviet officials. Otherwise, there are handful of interesting insights into submarine culture--if what we're seeing is an accurate portrayal.Overall, Hostile Waters the feel of a mediocre (to bad) TV movie (which I'm assuming it isn't), including some particularly unconvincing special effects--to the extent that, though this was made in 1997, I would've guessed '87. It just looks that dated. Only Hauer and Sheen's haggard appearances are any clue that it was made later."
4,Hostile Waters,"Although not 100% accurate, the film is a must to have for the cold-war, or submarine, interested individual. I would like to recommend the book ""Hostile Waters"", by Peter Huchthausen, Igor Kurdin , and Alan White, which gives a very accurate and exiting description of the actual events."
2,A missed chance,Having read the book first I really looked forward to the movie as a chance to dispel some of the strange ideas we have about Soviet sailors and to shed a little light on a very shadowy place in the worlds militaries.This chance was missed however by skimming over the cause of the events and failing to show the almost superhuman efforts the Russian captain and crew went through to save the situation. Rutger Hauers performance as a consumate submariner and commanding officer are as close to reality as this movie comes. Surely a missed chance.
1,Total crap,"First of all, when you get this program, it takles several calls to tech support to get it even installed. In the true program, the dictionary contains practically no words, and the voice translation technonlogy doesn't even work. Never buy any product by LanguageForce. I've tested many of them, and not one of them actually does what iy says it does on the box."
3,EXCELLENT,This was a very helpful to my performance in getting into a good college. I would recommend it to anyone who is 10 or older. I am 13 and I learned a lot of German from this CD.
1,This thing is a joke!,"This program made my windows 98 crash it is not compatable with Windows as it says it does, and if you do ge this thing to work it teaches you nothing. Better off looking at the book sections, and buy a good learn How to speak German book"
1,Can't use this to learn german,"I could not learn German from this software, I had too much trouble with it, was not working well on my computer platform. Made my windows pc crash to much."
4,The smog place said I needed a new oxygen sensor and it did what it was supposed to.,I ordered this item and it performed as expected. After installing it I was able to pass the smog test so I can recommend it to anyone who needs it for that purpose. In other words it works as expected so I was very satisfied.
5,Good quality,"I bought 2 of these barbells to replace my boyfriends CBRs he had. He was having issues with developing a pollup next to the ring, and as soon as he switched to the barbell, he hasn't had a problem since then. The one is a little longer than the other, and sticks in front of his eye slightly, but he likes them, and loves the way they look."
5,Like the music in the game you'll like it on the CD,"Just best from the game is all, nothing more, nothing less. Like the in-game music from both the original MediEvil and Resurrection than you should like this one."
3,Not Bronson,This movie was okay if you are really bored. I much prefered the origianal. Jason Statham is decent but certaily no Charles Bronson.
1,This MECHANIC CAN'T FIX this MOVIE,"- SPOILER AHEAD!- There are so many big logical holes that they ruin my interest. For example, Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) was able to train an alcoholic into an efficient killer. Yeah right!- The acting is not convincing at all. Especially Ben Foster does not act like a professional killer at all.- The plot is absolutely predictable.- There is neither any emotional nor interesting scene.- No wonder it flopped at the box office. According to rottentomatoes.com, domestically it made only 29.1 millions of dollars"
2,"OK movie, doesn't compare to the original","Movie was 'dry', not much to it, acting ok. The original wasn't that exciting, but it had more 'feel' and atmosphere to it than this does. They would have done better to just try and do an exact remake of the original. This is a 1 time watch rental and nothing more."
3,REMAKE,THE ORIGINAL MECHANIC WITH CHARLES BRONSON WAS A WHOLE LOT BETTER BUT JASON IS GETTINGPOPULAR AFTER THE TRANSPORTERWHY NOT
4,Fix my car!,"Awesome remake, better ending, more action, Statham is the new Stallone. They should offer this with the original as a 2 pack."
4,The Mechanic,Jason Statham is exciting to watch on dvd. The mechanic is another fine example of his athletic prowess and acting ability.
4,Decent and about average,"Nothing really spectacular here. Just a well made action movie. About what is to be expected from a hollywood big budget summer action movie. The script is tight, the acting is good and the action is great. It is a good popcorn action movie but really not more than that. You won't be talking about it at the water cooler tomorrow. But you won't be complaining about it either.About the remakeThis is a very loose remake of an old Charles Bronson movie by the same name. In that original workThe MechanicCharles Bronson is an aging hit man who takes on a young protege (Jan Michael Vincent) teaches him the ropes of being a hit man. That movie, while dated, is special.This movie loosely follows that same idea with a lot of modern updates. - more action, less dialogue, bigger explosions."
2,Uh oh - Better get Maaco,"Ya - this sucked. Gave it two stars cause near the middle it actually got a little fun. Statham should be in contest with Seagal to see who can keep their words under three syllables. Script sucked, plot sucked, pacing sucked. It was like a bunch of bad edits mashed together to fill in an hour and a half.Also, this wasn't violent for those who like some blood and guts.Meh - go watch some silly fun like The Expendables or Rambo instead."
2,"What, microphone showing up ??","I was watching the movie. Then in one of the scene (lasting few seconds), saw moving microphone overhead. Well, if this movie is serious, it should not have such things showing up in it !I have not finished the DVD yet, but kind of wondering if anyone saw it as well. I have not read through all the reviews of this DVD yet."
1,what a disapointment,"I only lasted 40 minutes. It was painful. It moves like molasses. The plot and motivation is poor. Barely any action. The acting is terrible. The cinematography is murky. I like Jason Statham but not in this movie. The only redeeming value is the introductory assassination (that sounds bad, I know). Terrible movie."
5,"Nice, it was different from the original","I loved the original, still do and I own it and it gets 6 stars as it is exceptional imo.This one was different enough and modernized to fit more in line with what I would call today's mores and guidelines. I liked it. It was different enough from the original that it was entertaining and deserved 5 stars. There was less attention to detail in the hits, but technologies were employed as a counter measure."
4,Another excellent Jason Statham movie!,"Another excellent Jason Statham movie! It held true to the original movie with Charles Bronson (which I liked), only with much better acting and updated special effects."
2,Why remake it?,"I don't understand hollywoods deal with remaking every movie they can think of. The original was fine and this movie has very little to do with the original. An assassin starts training a kid. That's about all they have in common. That's what I don't get, why even bother calling it a remake. Just make a new movie.The original seemed to focus more on the details of the hit while this movie just focused on the death scene for the most part. And god forbid that every movie not end with a happy ending. Sometimes the good guy/main character dies, it keeps things interesting. Which is one of the things that made the original better.It's worth the $1 rent but not worth buying."
4,Bronson he is not,"The special effects were better than the origional, but there were some slow spots. Good action movie over all and I enjoyed it for an afternoon of fun."
4,Good Statham action movie for it being a remarke of an older movie,"Good Statham action movie inculding some great fight scenes, gun shoot outs, plus mutiple scenes of things blowing up. This is a remake of an older movie of the same title, but I agree with other pople still packs a punch worth of doing over again meaning it keeps up with the original movie. It is a movie you can watch from start to finish without being bored part of the way threw the movie. So if you enjoy your action movies, pretty decent plotline, plus mutiple scenes of fighting, shoots outs, and buildings being blown up then pick this movie up and enjoy a good action flick for a night of peace quiet and a movie."
4,good movie,"I am a big fan of Jason Statham. Although not one of his best, in my mind, this is still a very good movie. Lots of action."
3,"Action Fine, Story Line ??","Probably will appeal more to some guys than some females with all the violence, explosions, and action. My husband really liked this movie, I'am sure for the action. I thought it was okay, because I like a little action in my movies as well. Jason Statham is not one of my favorite action he-man type guys. Actually, his acting is quite boring for me. He's no Bruce Willis, Jet Li, or Sylvester Stallone. I would like to see a lot more emotions on his emotionless facial expressions.This movies story line fell a little short for me. Killing Donald Sutherland, and then pretending it was not him by going after the real killers, made no sense to me. I know he had to do it, but to have him work with the son in finding the real killers baffled me even more. It was obvious the son was going to find out sooner or later. Of course, they would surely have a confrontation of some sort. I think the movie would have been more effective if the story line was more interesting."
4,The Mechanic?,"The movie came on schedule an it was in fair condition...typical Jason...quality of the movie was a little grainy, but it was okay.."
4,Pretty darn entertaining.,"Okay, as of late I have been stuck on period pieces, romantic movies and TV shows with hot vampire guys. I was glad to get a break from my normal girly stuff. I really enjoyed the action, the espionage genre depicted (although somewhat fantastical), the subtle comedy, and (yes) the ""kick-a**-ed-ness"" of it. Jason's acting is as usual...come on, what did you expect. However, it was nice surprise (as I didn't read anything about this movie cause my husband picked it out) to see Ben Foster and Donald Sutherland give the movie some much needed quality acting. For all you girly girls out there this movie is fun to watch...give it a try and make your significant-other happy."
4,Re-boot of Bronson flick with Jason,"If you liked the early Bronson film and like Statham, you'll like this remake. But be forewarned, the ending is radically different from the original and Ben foster is a better actor than Jan Michael vincent."
4,Enjoyable,"I saw this in the theatre. Amazon has pretty good streaming quality for its videos. I've never had a problem.This is a very suspend your disbelief type of action movie. There's a lot of violence, macho-man-ness, and blow 'em up fighting. For an action film, I found it very cleverly done. There were deeper thought moments. The acting was pretty good. It had interesting character interactions. Many of the actors faces I recognized. The plot even ended up having a little twist. I enjoyed this as an action piece. I have never seen the original, but I can compare this to other films of the same genre in theatres today. I would say this is better than most in theatres now."
2,Not in the same league as the original,Like comparing champagne to soda pop. The Mechanic 2011 has all the fizz but not nearly as much character as the original. The new movie is mildly entertaining but pales in comparison to the point of anemia when compared with the original version starring the all time champion of movie tough guys Charles Bronson & his co-star Jan-Michael Vincent. The new upstarts just don't have the pizazz the old pros had.
4,Good action movie,Well I havent seen the original.. so i am reviewing only on this movie on its own merit! I thought it was a great movie... good plot... good action.... buying on Bluray right now.. because i cant wait to see it again.
4,The Mechanic,"This was a great movie, it arrived in plenty of time, and was in great shape, I would recommend this sell to others."
4,Lethal Combination,"The Mechanic is $1.96 movie that I bought during last week's Black Friday. The movie is a remake of Charles Bronson's 1972 action film of the same name. Over the years I have become a fan of Statham's movies and surprisingly The Mechanic is above average action flick. Both Jason Statham and Ben Foster give great performances. The director Simon West also did a great job putting together a tight movie. Overall, even though it wasn't a perfect movie, I was entertained until the final explosion."
5,The Mechanic [Blu-ray],Bueno empecemos por decir que el item adquirido fue lo esperado y descrito segun anunciado y en resumida estoy satisfecho y lo recomiendo
2,So-so,"We were looking for a standard Statham action thriller for a Saturday night popcorn movie. Left us a bit dissatisfied. As expected, Statham provided an excellent imitation of a tree - wooden looks, monotonic voice and zero emotion. But, unlike other Statham fare, the action sequences in this one were pretty run-of-the-mill and ho-hum. Maybe he's set the bar high enough that what would have been cool 5 years ago is now boring. No ""wow"" scene. The plot was so transparent I can only assume the screenwriters worked for free. Donald Sutherland had a few lines and exited early. No one else could act. There was only one attractive woman in the whole movie - and she was on for 2 scenes.None of this would matter if the action had been jaw-dropping. But it wasn't. So 2 stars. Should have got something else."
3,needs something,"compared to the orignal, it did ok, but it seemed to lack something. only reason I got it was Jason Statham was in it. his other movies where really good. bronson has nothing to worry about"
2,"Cmon man, you can do better","I really like Jason as an actor but he is cranking out ""C"" movies like Van Damme did. Don't they have any better blockbuster scripts? This will be in the $5 movie bin in a year. Wait to buy."
2,"Needs an ""overhaul""",Not up to par with other Jason Strathom projects. Lacking on content. I lost interest very quickly with this all too familiar plot.
1,"Seen it, Done it - Before","Bland acting. Predictable dialogue. Boring, seen-it-too-many-times; something resembling action scenes.Original was much better."
2,Terrible Movie: Good Blu Ray,"This Movie had me until the ending, then it turned out to be basic Jason Statham typical crap. Ben Foster was the only good thing about that movie an anyone who saw this knows how that ends."
5,Jason Statham at his best,"If you enjoy Statham you will enjoy The Mechanic, it does what it sets out to do and that is to entertain you with 90 mins of action and suspense, awesome movie"
1,"Do not pay for this ""Journal""",I made a BIG mistake bying this blank notebook with a cover.Next time I will read other peoples reviews before bying.
1,"If you have a Boston terrier, buy it!","I think it's hilarious that this is called a ""french bulldog journal"". It has a boston terrier on the cover!"
2,Originally released as Ship of Fools,"This book is Ship of Fools under a new title. I was hoping for a sequel to that book as it resolved virtually nothing of the plot, however there doesn't appear to be one."
2,Doesn't follow the book well...at all.,"The only good thing about this animated version is whomever does the knight & Phillis Diller as the white queen. You find yourself saying ""ohmygawd, please don't sing."" The Tweedle's song is at least funny. Children will like this, but it will annoy the stuffings out of anyone over 8. Fortunately it's so sappy; parental supervision is completely unessisary. Alice's voice is particularly annoying & what's with the court jester?"
3,Okay,I think this toy is just okay. I'd say not worth the full price. I was expecting the plastic to be the similar to Fisher Prices Little People but it is more brittle (as another customer noted) and just seems substandard. My son has enjoyed this about half as much as I hoped.
5,What can I say...?,"You got the music, and the cool 'Clint Eastwood"" video on one CD-pretty good deal. Too bad the video's soundtrack isn't playable on a typical CD audio player (it's slightly different than the single you get) but other than that, no complaints."
5,BONNARD IS A BIBLE FOR ART LOVERS,"Bonnard is hot and getting hotter. You can't pick up a novel without reading that one of the characters either has a Bonnard, is getting ready to steal a Bonnard, or simply desires one.This book has great photos and the biography, which definitely belongs with the art, is extremely well written. This is a fine book and I like it so much that when my son, who is an artist, wanted to borrow it, I simply bought him his own copy. I keep mine for myself. Selfish, but true..and tells you how much I treasure it."
2,Not Impressed,"The scope of work presented in this book is very wide and complete, the ratio of text to pictures is very satisfying, and the pictures themselves are nice and large. However the quality of the reproductions has not impressed me at all, the colors that Bonnard is so famous for are washed out, and the prints appear blurry. Allover a rather disappointing book."
4,Memories....,"I learned the BASIC computer language from this manual when I was 12. I didn't even own an actual computer at the time, and would not own one for two more years (!) To this day, this book's ""talking computer"" cartoons are still lodged in my brain.(If my mind ever begins to unravel due to age/disease, they will probably be among the last things to depart.)This book now serves solely as piece of nostalgia for people like myself."
4,A good album worth finding.,"I found a used copy of this out-of-print album, and it has grown on me. I find myself playing it in the car. ""Notorious"" is a great song, ""Break it to me Gently"", and ""Hometown Hero"" are very good songs, and all the others are fairly good. I should really give this 3 1/2 stars, since it isn't as good as their first 3 recordings, but they don't allow half stars."
2,Holes not as small as advertised,"The add said it would seperate small berry seeds. The holes on the smallest grate are about 1/8"". You could fit 20 seed through one of them. Very disappointing."
1,Food Mill & Spaetzle Maker,Food mill broke the first time I used it and didn't receive the the Spaetzle Maker at all
1,Not what I had hoped.,This is the first book I purchased to learn the banjo. I am very disappointed. After I ordered this book I found a couple of sites on the internet that offer free lessons. The content on the internet is so much better. There is a CD with the book but it is also poorly done. The author goes through the songs he put in the book on the CD but never says one word about what the song is or this is the roll I am playing or any explanation at all. The whole book and CD are poorly done. I would not buy them again. That has nothing to do with who I bought them from. I do recall the shipping was slow and it took almost 2 weeks to receive them.
5,The BEST banjo book!,"Most books give you tabs and ""teach"" you to play songs--this book teaches you how to be a banjo player! It starts out so completely basic that you can't help but master a new lesson every time you pick the banjo up. It teaches you the basics of each song, then shows you different techniques you can use to make some real music! Rather than trying to memorize the rolls Hal's books put to each song, I can now dress up simple tunes any way I want AND sing at the same time since I'm not trying to remember what to play! The method of instruction in this book is SO amazing, you won't be disappointed!"
5,almost-instant gratification,"THIS MUST BE YOUR FIRST BANJO BOOK. It's a short on technique but long on something priceless -- motivation. You see, Erbsen teaches banjo by teaching you how to fake familiar songs. Instead of playing ""Cripple Creek"" over and over, or practicing rolls 'til your fingers bleed, you learn very short versions of some folk standards while learing how you can play simple but recognizable versions of your favorite songs -- bluegrass or otherwise.It works! I'd been playing for about a month when one day, just noodling around, I came up with a crude version of ""Route 66."" Now THAT was gratifying.I've since played ""Cripple Creek"" a few thousand times and practiced rolls until my fingertips were (almost) bleeding. I'm fairly sure I wouldn't have bothered if it hadn't been for Erbsen."
3,Okay,"Okay book, but there's nothing like taking lessons in person to get what you need. Good source for beginner songs."
3,Ignoramus,"I found this product to be lacking in providing a good foundation for the new banjo player. However, once you learn the fundumentals of playing your banjo, it became a better tool to use as part of my music growth."
5,REM: CD along with book,"The book is much more valuable if used with the included CD. The book was a bit hard for a hammer head like me to understand but was easier after I used the CD. Together, the CD and the book are a great package."
4,Very good book,This is a very good type of learning for me. I like the way the lessons are set up and I feel that I am continuously improving instead of feeling like I am at a standstill for weeks on end.
2,It's an early translator and it shows,"While it might have been considered ""decent"" in 1999 or 2000, it just doesn't really stack up to todays translation machines. It is decent in english to spanish, french and german... probably compriable to babelfish(free online translator). However for most other languages this thing is a complete mess and does a few poor job, missing many words or in some cases entire lines. Also the company who made it ""languageforce"" seems to have gone out of business. It seems to work on Vista even though it isn't made for it, and the interface kinda looks like it was made for windows 98 or something. I recommend skipping this thing and getting Power Translator 11."
1,A Rip Off,Dont waste your money they have no after sales service address.Someone is making money out of a product that has no return address. Will not work on XP.
1,Pathetic,I own a small motel and bought this software to use to give our Spanish speaking employees instructions. When I could get the software to work the employees could not understand the Spanish translations. It also was not compatable with the reservation software that I use and blew it off my computer. I had to reload the reservation software after loading the language translator. Then when I shut the computer down at night it blew my reservation software off again. The technical support was absolutely useless. The only thing they would offer was a program for over $200 that they said would work better. When I tried to get my money back I was told to forget it. Don't buy this unless you have money to throw into the trash.
1,translation of slavic language,"I found this software pathetic for use with the Slavic languages. Some of the most basic words such as 'good' in Slovak could not be translated. In Czech, 'good' tranlated into 'best'. Totally forget translation of sentences, it cannot do single words. For some reason translation into Russian would show up as Spanish. The speech synthesis was so bad it was actually funny. It apparently uses English phonetics no matter what language is being translated. This results is completely unrecognizable speech. If I hadn't received a full refund from COMPUSA, I would be very upset right now. By the way, don't expect any sympathy from the developer."
2,Unimpressive,I bought it mainly to assist in translation of my rusty Spanish. I spend more time updating the dictionary when I use it than I do actually translating with it. There's no throwing away your language dictionaries with this program.
1,Horrible,I purchased this same program through compuserve. I never received my rebate. I found it difficult to use and the people I sent the messages to responded in english that the messages I sent in their language was indecipherable
5,The Ultimate Queen album(s)!,"Queen have done us the favor of packaging all three of their ""Greatest Hits"" albums into one set. The original liner notes are still here, the packaging is very classy with a silver colored slipcase and, as an added bonus, all three CD's are picture discs!Though (as of the date I write this) the set is only available as an import, it is THE collection to buy and enjoy ALL of Queen's hits in one go, from 1974-1999, all the hit singles are here for several hours of pure musical bliss.If you buy any Queen release, THIS is the one to start with as it is a perfect primer for their studio/live albums...you may end up a Queen freak! Even if you just stick with ""The Platinum Collection"" (and have no interest in buying the other albums) you're set. A CD collection will NOT be complete without this release!"
4,"Great collection of hits, BUT!!","I would have given this five stars but there is no where on the cds or the back or front covers that state that this is an import. The item is in good shape,delivery was fast, slight scratches on one or 2 discs. I will update my review after i listen to all 3 discs."
3,figure issues with Kit Fisto's fighter,"My 7 year old picked out this starfighter as an early Christmas present. Kit Fisto is one of his favorite jedi, and he was looking forward to the toy. Unfortunately, we ran into trougbles with trying to get and fit a Kit Fisto figure into the ship. The box shows a Kit Fisto figure drawn in the cockpit. However, in small print you find that a figure is not included. So, we hunted down a Kit Fisto action figure, only to find out he does not fit in the cockpit. My son still plays with the ship a little, but he did cry over not being able to play with Kit Fisto in the ship. I dodn't know where to find a figure that will fit. The ship should come with one, or at least explain which one would be needed."
5,A must read for anyone interested in learning the true roots of world religions,"If you're at all interested in learning about the hidden symbolism and suppressed knowledge in world religions and cultural traditions, you really must read this book.Have you ever wondered how traditions like Santa Clause and Christmas trees began? This book will explain this and much more.The author's Jan Irvin and Andrew Rutajit have thoroughly provided all the sources needed to back up their work with copious footnotes, images and quotes.To quote Morpheus from 'The Matrix'...""After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.""This book is your red pill"
3,bought it because I knew the author,"Though Marty's confessions are as colorful as he was (is), I wish he would have asked me to edit as the typos jump off the page, along with poor sentence structure. There is a LOT more he could have written that would have made the book even juicier, but guess he doesn't want to reveal that ""even wilder"" side -- though I think he was dishing much more on others & not himself. This is one wild & crazy guy who had quite the pad in Reston back in the day. Hmmmmm It could have been called ""shades of black & white of an ex-secret service agent."""
5,Divertido,"Este libro narra la historia de Chin Chin, y el porqué se vuelve teporocho. Una historia divertida muy recomendable."
3,In the vein of NIGHTWISH???,"If Elis is to be compared to anyone, they're more like a heavier version of Lacuna Coil or Within Temptation. Sabine Dunser proves the theory that good looks don't equate to good singing, as she sounds like a robot half the time and cannot be placed in the same category as goddess Tarja. The drumming is too heavy for the music, which is mostly done on a synthesizer (which is played by Alexander Krull; he proves to be a better musician than anyone in Elis). Overall, if you heard the sample song (""For Such A Long Time"") on the Napalm Records sampler, and thought it was just so-so, like I did, then be cautious about buying because that's the best song on here aside from ""Child,"" which features Atrocity's drummer. I doubt many Nightwish fans will like Elis. They aren't bad, but they're not anything world-class."
3,Jon goes pop,"While he'd flirted around the edges of straight pop in the past, City of Angles was the first all-out pop album Jon Anderson had ever produced. That said, there are still plenty of Jon-isms spread throughout to please hardcore fans. ""Sundancing"" presages the Latin new age seen on Deseo and Toltec while ""New Civilization"" and ""Top of the World"" echo Yes' proggy grandeur. Some will be turned off by the slick production, plus many of the instrumental sounds and treatments are dated. But where the rubber hits the road -- songwriting and Jon's vocal performance -- here I'd give the album a thumbs up. Barely, though."
2,La la,"The album title should be warning enough. Follow the chain of association:""City of Angels"" = LA = la-la land = la laJon gets together with a good chunk of Toto to make a late-80's new-agey kind of deal, with the dreamy synths and world-music percussion and all. This CD should come with a freakin' magic crystal.Most of the songs are unlistenable. And yet, they do get better if you hit the skip button. ""Top of the World"" is a solid piece -- I think one of his best solo songs -- and ""Hurry Home"" ain't bad either.And that's the two stars right there."
3,Mixed bag of different styles,"Jon Anderson is an excellent vocalist. There is a lot of esoteric material on here. Some of it isn't really my style, but their are a couple of real gems that I like. ""Hold on to Love"" is a great upbeat song with signature Anderson vocals, and ""In a Lifetime"" is a beautiful catchy ballad that I never get tired of listening to."
3,An enjoyable album.,"Jon Anderson is a superb vocalist. No one else sounds like him. In the City of Angels is a pleasant listening experience. The production is very clean and spacious. The musicianship is also very good. In the City of Angels is mostly in a pop direction. My favorite songs are ""Hold on to Love"" and ""In a Lifetime."" I still enjoy hearing both of them--they are very well-written. The rest of the album is pretty good also. Jon Anderson has different musicians playing on various songs. Members of Toto play on a handful of them. Toto member (David Paich) helped write a couple of the tunes. The songwriting throughout is good and also experimental in places. In the City of Angels is worth a listen."
3,"Acceptable, but not great","The production value is terrible on this tape. It appears to have been filmed in one take, and you can hear outside traffic (including a motorcycle) in the background. The music starts and stops are also very jarring.I find the instruction is very straight-forward, although I'm not certain what level of dance it would be best for. It incorporates some very basic moves, and also shows some advanced floorwork. Perhaps this would be best for an intermediate level dancer.I did learn a handful of new moves from this tape, so it does have some use. Just don't expect high-quality production."
4,plenty of information,"this video is good for the beginning-to-intermediate or intermediate dancer or someone looking to flesh out their performance routine. it doesn't go through a warmup but takes you through the moves for both a slow chiftitelli floor routine and a fast drum solo. though i knew a good amount of the moves already the floor routine was helpful and there was enough new stuff to keep me interested. visual quality isn't the greatest but it gets the job done, and the video is definitely worth the price. the performance at the end is fabulous and i love the costume! one pet peeve: the dancer teaches you to do a full hip circle by straightening you legs to push your butt up when you get to the back and some other strange stuff...the way i was taught *not* to do it! i had heard of someone teaching it this way and i guess it was this video... otherwise the rest is all good information and she is an impressive dancer. i'd like to see more by her"
1,Mediocre Instructions,This tape in general is poor quality. She guides you stiffly through the movements and doesn't seem to be enjoying herself at all. I would not recommend this video.
3,rented at my library,"Alexandra King is a graceful, fluid dancer, on par with Neon. She does the best snake arms & wrist circles I have ever seen. Her performance at the end was graceful & you can really see her be in the moment & enjoy dancing.The teaching itself was simple & straightforward, especially if you want to incorporate zills. She teaches slowly first, then normal speed, then normal speed with zills w/ & w/o music. This is not a workout, but like a class.I took off 2 stars for VHS quality & sound quality & also that she could/should have had music playing softly at all times to kill the monotony."
3,Good beginner quality tape.,"Alexandra King is a gifted belly dancer and a good teacher. Her instructions are clear and performances are very enjoyable to watch. She is very good about taking the student through well-thought out drills to practice the steps and transitions. Quality of the video isn't the best, but it is certainly usable (and better than some others I've bought!). I loved the floor work and the performance section (floorwork and a drum solo) was inspiring!"
4,Some Great Stories But Is It Exaggerated?,"Pete Shotton was Lennon's buddy from childhood on. Pete was a stabilizing factor in Lennon's crazy life. You'll read about how, as boys, they made life miserable for the teachers at school. Some of the stories seem a bit exaggerated for effect; it's a bit hard to swallow that the headmaster can't tell the difference between rain on a window and a child urinating on the floor. Pete tells us about not surprising young days indulging in group masturbation and sex, on to the Dakota Days, with Dragon Lady Yoko obviously hating anyone who was ever friends with John. If you're a Lennon fan, find a copy."
1,I HAVE NOT YET RECIVED THIS ITEM,I HAVE NOT YET RECIVED THIS ITEM MAYBE IT GOT LOST IN THE POST WHO KNOWS FROM A DISAPOINTED BUYER A.SHOTTON
3,Disappointed,"Personally I found that it had too many back stories. All of which were depressing. There are some funny moments, but not as many as I would have liked. Half way through, I stopped reading it. I guess it just was not my type of book."
2,a lot of ideas but no story,"The book tries to have romance, history, suspense and it misses on all counts. You can figure out the stories of each woman when they are first introduced. One wonders why this women came together as much as you wonder why I am reading this book. NO REASON.."
2,Usually I love Lee Smith's books,"but this one just seem half done. The characters were interesting and I wanted a better description. Somehow they weren't fleshed out. It was just not like Lee Smith's previous books.But there were beautiful scenes, wonderful dialogue in places and I almost gasped at some things that seemed so familiar from my youth in the south.It was however a disappointment."
3,It could have been so much better,"I was very dissappointed in this book, maybe because the premise was so intriguiging to me. I expected to read much more about the first boat trip and what transpired there - I expected the events of the trip to have more long-reaching effects on the girls' lives. I wish they would have shown how the trip affected what type of women they became.And I certainly expected to know more about all the girls on the trip and how they related with each other. Why did the author even have 12 girls on the trip? She could have lessened the number and given us more insight into their personalities and interaction.This book focused on the individual stories of the four main characters with very loose threads tying them together. The book jacket is misleading, making the reader think the trip down the Mississippi is going to be featured in the book, when it is only referenced in passing."
1,Awful and hard to actually finish reading,I haven't had this much trouble getting through a book since I was in college. This book is boring and useless. I don't know why Good Morning America endorsed it.
3,rafting down the mighty mississippi,old friends relive a raft trip they took during senior year in high school. you find out what happened to each character after the raft trip and how they finally come to terms with it as older adults traveling on a steamboat down the Mississippi so many years later. a good read.
3,A little disappointing but nice Southern Fiction,"I am a big fan of Southern Fiction and of Lee Smith's other novels but I found this one a bit lacking.You develops a nice overall metaphor with life and the river but I don't think it was emphasized and brought out enough in the book. There were a lot of flashbacks in the book, as can be expected if you read the excerpts, but very little actual story of the trip down the river itself. I was left wanting more.This is a well written novel and gives a nice glimpse into the past and present south. It is still worth a read but I would more highly recommend Lee Smith's, ""Oral History."""
2,Hot Mess,"With great relief, I just turned the last page on The Last Girls. It was a book club selection, and I had no reason NOT to finish it. But, about 3/4 through it, I had a strong desire to heave it into the mighty Mississippi. I realized all the myriad characters and rambling plot lines were not going to come together. As stated in other reviews, the women were loosely connected by their college years and the original river trip. But, any semblance of maturing and sustaining friendships was not evident. The final few pages detailing the disposal of Baby's ashes was in the poorest of taste. A thoroughly unlikable cast of characters which I am delighted to say ""farewell!"""
2,Glad I bought it off the bargain rack....,"This wasn't a BAD book, I was able to finish it, but it definitely was not a page-turner that I was unable to put down. I generally like this type of storyline but this one didn't quite make the grade. I would have felt robbed if I had paid original full price for it, maybe even angry. I found myself wanting to finish it just so I could start something else."
1,There's a reason this book is so cheap...,"There was nothing captivating about this book or the characters in it. I struggled through the first 100 pages and literally could not motivate myself to finish it. The writing was extremely poor. There were names of people thrown around, with no depth or personality given to those names. The women that were spoken of in depth were shallow, unrealistic, and completely outside the realm of good character development. I had to read this book for a book club that I belong to and I simply have nothing positive to say. I have never read a novel by Lee Smith before and certainly never will again. This book is marked down on Amazon most likely because word got out about how bad it is and they now need to get rid of their inventory."
5,"A memorable story of change, growth, loss, and renewal","The Last Girls by Les Smith is the superbly crafted and engaging story about the reunion of close female friends and former roommates 35 years after they left a picturesque Blue Ridge women's college. It was in 1965, that they decided to go rafting down the Mississippi river in tribute to the classic tale of Huckleberry Finn. In the present day, they return to the river to bury the ashes of their mutual friend. a profound and memorable story of change, growth, loss, and renewal, The Last Girls is a thoroughly entertaining and highly recommended novel."
1,A trash heap,"This book is nothing more than a celebration of being a psychological, emotional and intellectual cripple."
1,"A schmaltzy ""romatic novel"" read","What drivel! It is a rare event when ""rights of passage"" novels can be sensitive, humerous and inspiring. ""The Last Girls"" lacks all of these qualities. Smith's character profiles leave you questioning who played what role when. It was difficult to believe this is the author who wrote ""Saving Grace""."
5,Rollin' on the River -- Yes!,"I haven't finished ""The Last Girls"" yet. I'm not even very far into it, preferring to limit myself (it's hard) to only a few pages a day so I won't get overly exuberant and start jumping over hedges or turning cartwheels in the grass. Even with as little as I've read, however, I can tell I'll be sorry to see it end. One reviewer put it perfectly when she said that this book -- I would add: and all Lee Smith's books -- makes you want to LIVE!And to the two reviewers who didn't like it: Are you out of your minds?"
3,A bit of a disappointment,"To me, a successful novel means that I'm intrigued by the characters, interested in the story and maybe pushed a little by new ideas or knowledge I gain by reading it.With that criteria in mind, this novel just wasn't more than a middling success. The characters were a bit muddled, racing between past and present situations, and always on the verge of another dramatic (as in soap opera) revelation. I never really cared about them.The story was OK, but a grand epic of the lives of women it was not. It pales in comparison to something like Joy Luck Club.Finally, I've read many other books that gave me a much stronger feeling of ""being"" in the South...Prince of Tides, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil both spring to mind.So, overall I'd rate this as a mildly entertaining book, but nothing I'd recommend to a friend."
3,The Last Girls,"The writing in this book is beautiful. The language captured me completely. The actual story, however, I found lacking. I wanted there to be more of an ending than there was. I thought the raft trip in the story would be more essential to the plot, but really, it was just sort of a sidenote. The premise has potential, but it just wasn't exactly realized. I'd still recommend it, however... just for the beauty of the writing."
2,Where is the river?,"I don't believe the four women in the book were on that raft on the Mississippi 35 years earlier. Their connection to the river and the adventures they had rings as false as their friendship. The book starts out ok but by the end it is clear that the story is never going to move to a deeper level. I wanted to take a scissors and rip open the boxes the characters put themselves in and refused to break out of. If the description of the silly luxury steamboat entertainment program is correct, that makes me as sad as the empty lives of Anna, Harriet, Courtney and Catherine. Where is the romance, beauty, and mystery of the river?"
1,Depressing and badly written,"I can't believe the same woman who wrote Fair and Tender Ladies wrote The Last Girls, too.The characters in The Last Girls are self-absorbed and cliched so much that I don't care a bit about them. And what are the odds, in a real world, that two of the men in the story (Gene and Kenneth) would be legally blind but fabulous lovers nonetheless? Harriet is the stereotypical meek-never-married-sorry-she-was-ever-born and I was so sick of reading her story. Baby is wild and angry; Catherine has to have a man to feel whole; blah, blah, blah.What a stupid, stupid book. If you absolutely must read it, get it from the library and don't say you weren't warned."
3,Average book,"My criticisms for the book:The flow of the stories of the past and present with each characters was off. I had a hard time remembering each character and who she ""was"" and what she was going though. Thus, I didn't become attached to any character. I also didn't like that these girls didn't seem to be that good of friends, they hardly kept in touch!Didn't like the ending. Why are we given an update on several characters that were never mentioned through out the book at all? Could have totally left that out.What I liked:Good plot. And I liked that the characters were all going through different things in their lives.I did feel some suspense for what was going to happen.Overall the book was ok. I've read much better, but it wasn't totally disappointing."
4,A little disappointed by the ending,Cat was great. The various hunts were great. A little disappointed by the ending. I agree with some other reviewers that the mythology / ancient story telling was a bit heavy relative to the length of the rest of the book.
2,Stream of Conciousness Pschobabble,"Usually, I really like Zelazny's work. Unfortunately, in this case, he's just gone too far with his mythological basis. I'd estimate that more than half of this book consists of nothing but his interpretation of snippets from Navajo mythology stuck smack in the middle of a story. There IS a decent action-packed plot buried in there, but it's just overwhelmed by the mythology. By the end, the whole thing becomes a psychological ""experience"" as Zelazny basically drops the plot so the protagonist can confront himself. Even worse, the very last pages leave me unsure about whether or not he succeeds. With a tighter linkage between mythology and plot, this could have been an excellent book. But, because the two elements are so disjoint, and because Zelazny emphasizes the mythology over the plot, it just fails. So, unfortunately, I have to rate this book at a Not Very Good 2 stars out of 5."
5,I Really LIke This This Book,"I had a wonderful time reading this book. It's more of a *long* essay than it is a book. The writing is excellent, and there are lots of wonderful photographs interspersed within. I don't know if it really matters, but for what it's worth I read part of this book while sitting at a table at Birdland on 46th Street in NYC waiting for my favorite up and coming piano player, David Epstein, to return from break to play another set. I have three books by Gary Giddins and like him so much I'm going to buy more of his books. By coinicidence I saw a video recently on the life of Charlie Parker, and it used many of the same photographs that were used in this book. I am not aware of a tie in between the two products however. In conclusion, this book was enjoyable and I learned a great deal about Charlie Parker from the point of view of his personality and his character and what his life was like."
3,Depicting the subcontinent is no breeze!,"Few books on India can easily hope to undertake and accomplish the monumental task of depicting this complex society. This book is no exception. By taking the lens of the monsoon -- and the beliefs and practices which surround it in India - this book has adopted a wonderful device to depict a wide swathe of this country. Entertaining and thoughtful, this is certainly one of the more informative travelogues on India."
5,Great book.,You will learn a lot about India while reading this entertaining book. You don't need to be interested in weather. That's not the main point of the book - it's the people and places that are the stars.
2,"A great idea, a mediocre book","Mr. Frater's work does not get to the richness or vivid color of India. Any book having anything to do with India should be rich and complex, stunning, dazzling, challenging and confusing. I found this work dragged"
1,Serrated foil knife broke during first use.,"The serrated foil knife broke the first time I used the tool. The foil knife is supposed to bend 90 degrees from the closed position and stop. Mine now bends 180 degrees.The monitary loss on this product ($6.00 + shipping) is insignificant compared to the frustration of having to spend my time to now go and buy another tool to open wine bottles.Also, this is not a genuine Pulltaps product. Though the product description doesn't claim that this is a genuine Pulltaps product, the picture from ReelBigFishKicks can give the misleading impression that it is a genuine Pulltaps product."
1,Junk.,"I've seen other reviews complaining that this isn't an authentic Pulltap; when I purchased them, I saw nothing on the page that indicated it was, so I'm not upset about that. I bought two a couple months ago. I specifically ordered cheap corkscrews because I'm a bartender, and frankly I lose them fairly quickly. I also refuse to use anything other than the two-stage (or double-hinged, whatever) types because they work best for me. However, both of mine broke well before I was able to lose them. In one case, the screw was bent to a point that it was unusable. In the other case, the screw came off completely.Yes, they're cheap, but for a reason - they break. Spend a few extra bucks to get something that will actually work for more than a half dozen bottles."
1,Inferior,This is an inferior imitation of the professional waiter's corkscrew. The middle of the screw-shaft shearred during the first insertion into the cork. Pay $10 more for a Pulltaps brand that will last a lifetime.
3,Not a Pulltap,"The photo is misleading. This IS a generic item and not a Pulltap. Appears to be a fine product, however time will tell."
4,Good product.,I really like this product. It works perfectly and shipped in just a few days. It does exactly what it needs to: opens bottles.
2,Broke!,Corkscrew popped loose after less then 20 bottles. Threw it in the garbage. I like the style but I need it to last longer then that.
5,HANDY TOOL GREAT CONSTRUCTION SHOULD LAST A LONG TIME,NEVER HAD ONE LIKE IT BUT EVEN MY WIFE AND SON CAN USE IT WITH EASE. PRO QUALITY GREAT FOR KITCKEN DRAWN OR PICNIC BASKET.
5,BEST AND MOST AFFORABLE!,"I've always been a fan of the portability of waiter style corkscrews! This one is by far the cheapest without sacificing any quality! The construction is great and works flawlessly! You don't get the fancy solid wood handle of more expensive models, but for less than $10, who can complain?? I would definately recommend this!"
2,I've used better,"I'm a server, so I uncork a lot of wine bottles. I'm not a big fan of this one. I've put up with it for about a month, but I'm trying to find a new one. The main problem is: the way the second (lower) hinge is shaped means that it digs into the cork as you're trying to pull it out. I have to reposition it 2-3 times each time I'm opening a bottle so that it doesn't gouge out large chunks of cork.If you're just opening an occassional bottle at home, this will be fine. The rest of it works well- the foil cutter and corkscrew are smooth and work well. But for someone opening a lot of bottles, it gets tedious."
3,"Double-hinged is great, but corkscrew itself is flimsy","Given the generally positive reviews, I had high hopes for this one. If you've never tried one, you'll find the double-hinged action makes quick work of opening bottles compared to conventional single-hinged waiter-styled openers. But the big letdown on this one was the corkscrew itself: it bent 3/8"" after the first bottle! Now trying to thread it straight down into a cork is virtually impossible for us. Great concept and great price, but the metal used is flimsy. It's now keeping company with the lone corn-cob holder that lost its mate in the back of the drawer."
2,Home Use ONLY - Not Professional Quality,Worked smoothly at home; sharp knife... But it BROKE the 1ST night I brought it to work as a bartender.
1,Not a real Pulltap's brand corkscrew,"I've been working in restaurants for 15 years and rely heavily on this style of corkscrew. Through the years, I've been through plenty and no matter who makes them, they wear out eventually. The Pulltap's wine key is the best for the price and I buy them religiously. This cheap garbage is not a Pulltap's brand corkscrew, it's made in China. Save your money for the real thing."
1,Bent after a few uses!,"Edit: The corkscrew bent during normal use after only 3 months! I've opened maybe 6 bottles of wine with this tool and it was great until the final bottle. The top rotation of the screw became totally bent - it's useless now.[Original Review:] Opening wine with long corks is so easy with this corkscrew! I expected the hinge to move more easily out of the box, but a little elbow grease loosened it up. Would buy this again."
1,Not a real Pulltap product,This wine key broke on me after about a week of use. The screw just snapped right off as I was trying to open a bottle. This happened because it was a cheap knock off of what is advertised as a quality Pulltap product. I would advise not buying this item.
1,Broke on first use,"I used this device once and it it broke immediately. The screw actually snapped off from the handle. Unfortunately my first use of the thing was outside of my return window. Don't buy, it's a cheap and not durable at all."
1,Not Pulltap,"I ordered and received two black wine keys - same Pulltap design but NOT Pulltap brand. After two nights of use at my bar the hinges are already loose, which has never happened with wine keys I have bought from Pulltap. The product description amounts to a false advertisement."
1,No Stars for this product,It broke the first time I tried to use it. The corkskrew detatched from the handle. Very shoddy product.
3,"Works fine, but not as solid as I'd hoped","My friend has a sturdy metal Pulltap corkscrew whose double-jointed perfection was so satisfying to use that I just had to get one for myself. So I ordered one of these. I was disappointed to find, once it arrived, that it was narrower than my friend's model, both the handle and the screw, and somewhat less solid feeling. In fact, after a few uses the little plastic insert in the handle came unglued. All things considered it's still a good little tool, especially for the price, far and away better than the other less-than-useful corkscrews lying around the kitchen, but it did not live up to my expectations. I'll wait until I see one in a brick and mortar store before I buy another. (And one of these days I'll get around to gluing that piece of plastic back in place.)"
5,Awesome wine opener,"Watched a waiter in a restaurant I was at the other night use one of these and I fell in love. The HUGE advantage is the double hinged tip. You first screw it in so that you are using the upper most part on the lip of the wine bottle. Then after pulling the cork half way out, you use the top hook on the top of the wine cork and the bottom one on the lip. Have not had any issue opening a bottle since starting using this."
3,OKay product,"Nothing fancy. Nothing special. If you need just several functions, this is for you. We just need one for once a year. Hope it will last."
3,Broke,It broke on me in the middle of a wine presentation but at least it was cheap and it did open many bottles so if you dont need to use it many many times your fine!
3,"attractive, but not very impressive","This corkscrew is very stylish and attractive. Unfortunately, it's no easier to use than any other corkscrew. If you want something to make your life easier when you open a bottle of wine, I recently got a Stone Cask Easy Pull corkscrew. I'd strongly recommend something more like that, or an electric corkscrew. It will cost you more, but it's a much better value."
2,"Seemed good, but 1 has already broke","Seemed good at first, but after only a few uses one of these that I ordered has already broken. One of the little bars or screws that holds the hinges together just fell out. Cheap"
1,Items never came,"I'm a supervisor at a golf club and ordered a few of these for my bartenders as throw aways, as wine keys typically disappear pretty fast when you have so many events. So the price of these were perfect; but I can't comment as to the quality or anything else because they never showed up. After months of communicating with USPS (as per the request of the seller) I gave up and got some more expensive ones locally.Basically the seller said, ""Talk to USPS, it's not our problem."" The items come from China and had an estimated delivery date of over two months in the future and according to the seller is exactly when they should have been there. They tell you the estimated delivery isn't two months typically. It's been about a year and I'm pretty sure I could have walked/swam the 5 wine keys myself in that time."
1,Don't waste your time!,I wish I could give a zero rating! Cork screw broke the first time I used it. the screw broke inside the cork! Price is too good to be true!
3,Worth $2,Well made knockoff for 1/4 the price of a Pulltap. Well made knockoff for 1/4 the price of a Pulltap.
1,Broke in first try,"It broke when I tried to open the first bottle. It seems the ""steel"" used is really bad. It didn't even bend, just broke."
1,Crooked after first use,"I bought this corkscrew to work at some catering gigs I have. I liked the product, looked good and similar to the one I had for years but lost it. It came out crooked on my first use. Unfortunately I had no other with me. I thought it would be as good as the one I had and did not bring any backup. It was a disappointment. Could have loaded a pic of it if Amazon had this feature at the review."
1,Pathetically cheap,"I was able to open 4 bottles of wine before this broke. It came from Solar Wholesale. Cheap aluminum metal that cannot withstand the torque required. I should have known better... Amazon, you need to pay attention to all the negative feedback on this item."
2,Cheap Construction,This corkscrew worked fairly well for a couple weeks before the small spring holding the blade broke. Had to throw it away as it would have been easy to accidentally cut yourself (especially opening a second bottle of wine). I'm a fan of the waiters style corkscrew but I wouldn't recommend this one.
3,Plastic fell off,This item was ordered along with some other items.It came in a long paper box. When I unpacked it the plastic part on the hand bar immediately fell off due to bad adhesive quality.I did not return the item because too much hassle in relation to the low price.
4,"Generic, no brand black corkscrew. Does what it's supposed to and folds away nicely.","It's a corkscrew that is designed for one thing, opening bottles. So far I have used it to open wine and beer bottles. It works great and does exactly what it is meant to. It even has a blade, for which I have yet to find a use.The only complaint I have about this item is the price. My buddy bought this exact model (only in a yellowish color) from the local dollar store for $1.07. That is 6 times less than what I paid for it, although mine was shipped directly to my house, so I guess that makes up a bit for the price hike.The $1 dollar opener my friend has is exactly like the one I received from Amazon. The only difference is the color. So I am docking 1 star for the price difference, since the models are identical and color doesn't really matter much in a bottle opener.Still, it works, and has held up well so far after a few months of use."
2,Broke after third bottle,"After only the third bottle, this opener broke where the corkscrew connected to the rest of the opener. It worked on the first two bottles, but took some time to figure out. On the second bottle, the cork was cut in half. The corkscrew on this thing is a little tricky to use, and you are more likely to destroy the cork. Right now, the corkscrew is stuck in the cork of the third bottle. Very disappointed in this product and do not recommend it. Pay more for something that will last longer with ease of use."
1,Poor copy of a great corkscrew,LilyHome is buying this Chinese copy and selling it as the real thing. LilyHome does not tell you that the real Pulltap corkscrew is made in Spain and is patented and is a much better tool. The handle of my Chinese copy broke while opening its forth bottle of wine. Amazon is putting their reputation at risk by not requiring a statement of country of origin in the description. Do not be fooled.
1,Not a true Pulltap,"I ordered this item sold by ""ACCZILLA"" and (I think) fulfilled by Amazon. I received it promptly, but there was no brand name on the corkscrew or the packaging, so I returned it. There are others sold on Amazon with the Pulltap logo for about twice the price."
2,So so,The corkscrew is made out of a weak metal that bends easily. It's ok if it's just for home use. Goodbye
2,Not professional quality,"Sure, we can open our wine bottles - but these corkscrews are straight up ghetto. The pieces don't all fit flush and the paint job is terrible."
4,Exactly what I expected,"The corkscrew got here sooner that I was expecting, and the product seems as advertised. For what I spent, I'm satisfied with my purchase, especially how quickly it was shipped."
2,Not the same as shown,"Others warned about it and they were right. The opener I got was clearly not the one shown in the pictures. It works, but not as well as I know it should. You get what you pay for."
4,the one I always buy,"Solid, effective, compact, and easy to use. The wine key I always buy to replace the ones that are inevitably lost or taken on the job."
5,A little book but a big treasure,"General Microbiology is the kind of book that I always wont to find and learn from it. The book has a concise presentation that gives an overview of the field to students not only focused in microbiology, but also to students of botany -my self- zoology, chemistry and other disciplines. I thanks the author for such a great book and especially for made it for students who are discovering and learning the marvellous world of biological sciences."
4,Nice arrangements,"This book is basically the ""Fingerstyle Guitar Christmas"" book from Hal Leonard Corp. with classical notation. I have both books now!! I think the arrangements are nice, not so simple yet not so difficult to play. The songs were arranged by Marcel Robinson. Let It Snow! Let It Snow! is also arranged by Marcel Robinson in the same style. The arrangements are great to play among family and friends but not on stage. If you want to play arrangements that are more technically challenging, look to Mark Hanson and you won't go wrong."
1,Overly simple,"I don't find the pieces to be interesting to play. They're overly simple. I bought the book looking for arrangements I could perform, but you would be hard pressed to entertain anyone with these. Sometimes a simple piece can be moving, but not these."
5,Classical guitar Christmas,The book is great. It was what I expected and it came so soon after ordering.
4,pocket playing,"This is vintage ""in-the-pocket"" playing by the man himself- Steve Gadd...a must have for drummers."
3,Dark and Sensual,"What do you thing of when you think Vampire? Blood? Sex? Seduction? All of the above? This deck takes a look into the lives and hearts of vampires. I am unsure of any particular mythology ascribed to by the author and the artist, but the imagery and symbolism paint a beautiful realm of dark, forbidden and unappologetic pleasures."
3,good only for bedding/sweaters,"They work as advertised. However, they're really only economical for large, foofy items like bedding or sweaters. T-shirts and pants hardly compress at all, so you're probably better off getting a cheaper non-vacuum bag. It IS pretty cool to see the bedding shrink though. As for the concern about vacuum hose nozzle size ... we did not find it a problem. The one way valve seemed to work fine, even if the hose fit on top of the valve and did not cover the valve."
5,Still the Best,"I have eagerly been anticipating the release of this Academy Awarding winning movie on DVD for years and I have not been disappointed. This is a classic American film and still holds up after all these years. The performances by Warren Beatty and the rest of the cast are superb and this is a great history lesson for anyone who wants to see a snapshot of the world during the time of the Russian Revolution. It is the perfect mix of biography, romance and history and I recommend it to all film enthusiasts as well as Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton fans."
5,My favorite movie.,"I love it , my family love it also . This is the best movie ever , romantic movie to see."
5,Reds - still doesn't disappoint,Loved this movie when it first came out and it has withstood the test of time. The material is relevant and the players extraordinary in my opinion. Happy to have it in my library.
4,Great Film!,"This is a great film if you love history and are a fan of Keaton, Nicholson and Beatty...they are great in this film and the history behind it is amazing...Beatty captures the emotions of the era. Besides the wonderful acting by Keaton (in my opinion one of her best films) and the cinematography, the interviews with the people who knew Louise Bryant and Jack Reed bring this film to life!"
4,"Helluva movie....hellish long, too!","WOW! I just finished watching ""Reds"" for the first time since it was first run, and while I liked it much more than before, I'm glad I got it at my local library, & had a week to watch it....or I would have, if I hadn't found it so gripping that I watched it spread over about 10 hours.I always really found the ""talking heads"" spots very interesting. These spots with people who knew Jack Reed, Louise Bryant, and Emma Goldman(or at least people who were around then) were very interesting, except for George Jessel...why him??Brew some coffee, pop some corn, & settle in. ""Reds"" isn't for everyone, but it is an intelligent look at a time that almost no one is alive to tell us about."
3,Lost Some Luster,"This film has not held up particularly well over the years. The story is overwrought, overly long and tended to gloss over the historical events I was most interested in. Jack Nicholson is great as the playwright, Eugene O'Neill, and Beatty plays zeal well. However, I don't know that Diane Keaton was the best choice for the role, even though I am usually a big fan. A good movie, but not a great movie...Also, I will admit I'm no tech wizard, but I don't understand why the film requires 2 Blu-Ray discs, as I understand them to contain about 6 times the information of standard DVDs. Does anyone believe this film necessitated a 2-disc BR release when 'Gone With the Wind' is satisfied with 1 disc?"
1,boring,"Reds is, possibly, the most boring movie ever made. When it first came out, four of us went to the movies. Two of us, mercifully, got up and left about the middle of the picture, leaving the other couple to suffer thru it. Who needs a bunch of boring Russian communists."
2,Preachy yawn-fest with horrible period portrayal...,"For the life of me I will NEVER understand the following for this movie... not even among hopeless and hapless lefties! If I were them, I would demand a much better film...Warren Beatty runs around grinning with his 80's hair falling in his face... utterly unconvincing as a journalist, radical, or human being. Diane Keaton seems intent on portraying Louise Bryant as a sympathetic and idealistic dreamer; she comes off as unbelievably selfish and whiney [probably an inadventent accuracy, actually!]The costuming is horrible. Honestly WHERE was the 30 million bux even spent?? The cut of the clothes is almost always off... hairstyles bear NO resemblance to those of the teen years and '20s... even the dialogue is full of unbearable modern colloquialisms.And I could go on and ON... no kidding.Seriously lefties... demand a better film. LOL"
1,"Gee, what a surprise.","To all of you people who have raved about what a wonderful, endearing movie this is, which glorified a Communist dictatorship during the birth of the most ruthless, repressive, genocidal regimes in all of history: how would you feel if, instead of Warren Beatty glorifying the Communist revolution he had made a film glorifying the Third Reich and shown the Nazi leaders as idealistic and self-sacrificing? Another question, do any of you still have any doubts that Hollywood has been peddling Communist propaganda for the past half century? If so, let me direct you to films like Che, Cuba, The Front, The Motorcycle Diaries, just as a start. All of these limousine Communists make me sick."
1,Awful and awfully long,"I saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1981.In a word - AWFUL.Not only is it awful, it is awfully long. It is so long that when shown in the theater, there was an intermission. The intermission was the best part of the movie as it allowed us to politely leave the theater without disturbing other patrons. Interestingly, there were quite a few others (perhaps half of the theater) who left the same time we did. In all the movies I've attended, I've never seen that happen before or after.One of the 5 stars reviews noted, ""Although it did not succeed at the box office,"" - Well there is a reason why.Save your money. Don't waste it on this pathetic propaganda."
1,Smug communist propaganda and boring at that,"""Reds"" is an irritatingly self-satisfied film telling the story of two unbelievably selfish and naive American communists John Reed and Louise Bryant (played by a smug Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton).Since the film was made in 1981 communism has fallen rendering the fledgling communist movement in the US - and this film - largely irrelevent and reinforcing how naive and misguided people like John Reed and his colleagues were - one can't help but be disgusted as one watches the film at how they were prepared to look the other way as the Bolsheviks tyrannised the Russian population.The low budget look of the film, combined with its mediocre actors and gargantuan length (188 minutes) give ""Reds"" the feel of one of those 80s mini-series. Only Jack Nicholson as writer Eugene O'Neill gives it any spark. Smug communist propaganda and boring at that."
1,They don't let me say 0 stars,"This piece of pretencious smut was nominated for 11 academy awards. Supposedly ment to be a historical documentary, it is little more than 4 gruelingly unimaginative hours of bed room scenes moving across Russia during the October Revolution. Why anyone would want to subject themselves to this after seeing it once is beyond me."
1,Dull Dull Dull,"I saw this in the theatre in 1981. The dog sitting outside the bedroom door was the only interesting thing about this waste of celluloid.Spend your 14.00 on a pizza, at least you will have satisfied your hunger."
5,THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN,"YES, IT'S GREAT FOR MANY REASONS. ITS COMPLETELY ROMANTIC,CAPTIVATING AND IS FULL OF JACK REEDS NEED FOR THE TRUTH, TO WRITE ABOUT IT AND TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. HE SEEMS TO TURN FROM WRITER TO POLITICAL ACTIVIST AT THE COST OF HIS OWN HEALTH (THIS ONE EVEN PISSES RED!) THIS ONE YOUVE GOT TO SEE. I WAS TOTALLY DRAWN TO WARREN BEATTY'S CHARACTER AND WHEN I SAW HIS NAME 80,000 TIMES WHEN THE CREDITS ROLLED I WAS TAKEN WITH HIM-COMPLETELY IMPRESSED WITH THIS PERSONS ABILITY TO TAKE ME THROUGH SO MANY EMOTIONS AND GET EVERYONE IN MY LIVINGROOM IN A POLITICAL DEBATE. WE ENJOYED THIS EXPERIENCE MORE THAN I KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS AND WANTED TO SHARE IT WITH EVERONE. I FIND MYSELF RECOMMENDING IT WHENEVER THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES! ENJOY IT- MARE"
5,the best bargain on amazon.com,"this is one of the great american film masterpieces, along with citizen kane, annie hall, unforgiven and many others, but the best thing about the dvd is all of the great extras and at a remarkably low price. that being said, if you are a closed-minded, right wing, capitalist republican you are probably not going to like it."
1,Silk purse that's really a pig's ear,"I wrote a favorable review earlier, but that was before I knew (it was recently found in USSR records) that John Reed recieved over 1million from his pals in the bolsheviks/soviet union in the 1910s and 20s.It's not the movie's fault, because the makers had no way to know, that Reed was not so much an idealist who did too much dreaming for everyone's good, as a flat out paid communist agent serving his masters for cash and probably not asking too many hard questions to keep that cash coming in.Everybody admires an idealist (even one who is wrong), but nobody likes a toadie, and this revelation makes the movie, no matter how well done, mortally flawed and a waste of time."
3,"Just as boring as I remembered,","I first saw Reds about 9 years ago on a scratchy VHS. I had some fond memories of it and thought I might get more out of it remastered. Here's a movie with a prepondernce of talent, drama, and social commentary. The first hours is spellbinding. Beatty and Keaton give strong 70s-ish performances, and Nicholson is spellbinding as Eugene O'Neill. The ""witnesses"" such as Henry Miller are funny, and insightful. The remaining TWO AND A HALF HOURS, however, are intermitent at best. This is Beatty doing his Doctor Zivago schtick, and doubling the running time of a biopic for a historical figure who doesn't have the depth, imporance, or longevity to deserve it. This is not Ghandi, Malcolm X, or Howard Hughes. He's a womanizing, trust-fund socialist journalist who has some place in history, but not 3-1/2 hours,"
5,REDS,"Writer-director Beatty's Oscar-winning portrait of leftie scribe John Reed and his paramour Bryant is equal parts sweeping historical epic, tragic romance, and paean to the once influential voices of early American socialism. His ingenious use of actual interviews with those who knew the Greenwich Village couple--including Henry Miller and Rebecca West--gives the picture an extra depth and dramatic veracity. But it's the chemistry between Beatty's uncompromising Reed, a man devoted to the principle of class struggle, and Keaton's fiercely independent Bryant that's sure to rouse your inner rebel. With terrific support from Maureen Stapleton (as Emma Goldman), and Jack Nicholson (as cynical playwright Eugene O'Neill), ""Reds"" is a film that embraces love and politics without giving short shrift to either."
5,Compelling Film,Reds is a beautiful film about interesting people during a critical time in history. Acting is stellar. Totally absorbing. One of my top ten favorite films.
4,Important movie for youth of today,"Reds follows the movies, Nicholas and Alexandra, and Dr. Zhivago, all three together giving the history of the Communist revolution and its terribly disappointing and all too often fatal consequences."
5,An Incredible Masterpiece!,"This is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It shows you how much we owe to the people of the past who gave their hearts, souls and lives to help create a level of peace, freedom and prosperity for all of us. I hope this film will inspire us to follow this tradition.I will have to heartily disagree with Albert Lee. Although he is helpful in the sense that whatever he rates a film you can be sure the exact opposite is true. As you can see he has given this film only one star. High praise indeed."
5,An Oldie But A Goodie - Beatty is timeless,"If you haven't seen Reds, then you need to, because even though it's now 25 years old, it's still wonderful: well-written, well shot, beautifully directed, and wonderfully acted. The story is still pertinent - and now, 25 years later, seems to be even more poignant. Especially interesting is Beatty's decsion as a director to include interviews with the movers and shakers of the time, and the way they were shot and edited is fascinating...Don't pass this one up!"
5,"Excellent single, probably won't get much play in the US.","A massive hit single in Europe, Chicane's ""Don't give up"" is an excellent euro-dance tune with rather unreccognizable vocals from Bryan Adams. The song is upbeat yet at the same time relaxing and very ""chill-out"". It seems to be doing well in the clubs, but I doubt the US radio market will take to it the way they did over in Europe.In regards to the remix version, it is done by Disco Citizens, which is simply another project by the man behind Chicane - they're the same person! So no remixer was attempting ""steel"" the spotlight from Chicane."
2,Where are the VOCALS?,"Once again, a remixer has taken a great song and turned in a mediocre mix. Sure, the beats are strong, but where are the freakin' vocals? Time after time, remixers seem to think their mix is the star of the show and not the artist (unless, of course, they're the artist to begin with! :-P). Please, DJs, leave in the vocals. This remix is nothing but a long instrumental. Not totally uninteresting, but not great, either."
3,Good,"Had significantly more wear and tear and highlighting than I expected. Good purchase, given the price;however, probably would not use again. For ten more dollars, I could have gotten a like new textbook."
3,average,"i realize that a review of a textbook is somewhat of a moot point. after all, you have to buy the book that the professor tells you to buy. but, here it is anyway:the book was average in every sense of the word. the one thing i did not like about it was that it did not highlight every new word or phrase and define it. only about half of the new words or phrases were highlighted in a text box next to the paragraph. this means that if you were searching for a word or phrase, if it was not noted in the margin, then it was very difficult to find it. this is fairly typical of textbooks, so i figured it was average."
3,Accounting Lite,"This text is more sizzle than steak.Appropriate, perhaps, for a survey class for non-accounting majors, but insufficient for the student pursuing accounting as a major. Let's face it, a large part of introductory accounting is drill and practice. The book skimps on these elements. The narrative is generally lively, and true to its billing the book is full of real-world examples for the chapter subjects. The text also has a very modern, splashy graphic design.The book does not have enough in the way of examples that teach the mechanics of journal entries, T-accounts and the like.This text, unfortunately, represents the trend of dumbing down our school books. An ""A"" for style, a ""C+"" for substance."
2,I can't wait to re-sell this book,"This book is not for beginners! The exercises in the textbook are difficult to follow because they don't provide much examples in the chapters. Also, important topics are briefly discussed. However, I enjoyed reading the case studies."
1,NOT A GOOD BOOK FOR INTRO TO FINANCIAL ACCT !,"The book's preface indicates ""We assume the students has had no prior exposure to accounting and financial statements, and has had little exposure to the business world"". Hah! As I read through this book, I honestly believe these authors (professional CPAs) had completely forgot who their target audiences were.If this is a required textbook for your class, I highly suggest looking into a good supplemental book. Good luck."
1,Poorest text ever written,"If your school uses this book, not only don't take this class, drop out of the school. If I could rate this with negative numbers I would. This is the worst textbook ever devised by man OR woman. If you are already a CPA looking for a review, it might be worth something, otherwise it teaches nothing. It presents examples without first explaining things then explains things using examples that have no bearing on what is being taught.If you have to use this book, my sympathy for you. I can only hope the school will refund at least a portion of my money."
4,Another winner from Sarah Dunant,"I bought this book, the second in the Hannah Wolfe series, because I thoroughly enjoyed Birth Marks. I think that this book was even better as Hannah is now maturing as a woman and a detective and I like her even better than I did in Birth Marks. This is a fast paced page turner as are all of Sarah Dunant's books, including her historical novels which I have also read. I highly recommend the Hannah Wolfe series to any reader who enjoys a compelling story with likeable characters. Hannah will make you laugh with her wise cracks and quirky sense of humor. In Fatlands, Dunant steps from behind the ""writer's curtain"" and addresses the reader directly. I have read other books where this technique has fallen flat but in the hands of a talented writer like Dunant, it worked."
3,Dry text,"I read the first few chapters as required reading for a Linguistics course I am taking. It is quite dry and didn't really interest me, but I suppose it gets a lot of information across."
4,Makes brushing fun,"This makes brushing something to look forward to doing, as well as encourages throughly cleaning teeth. A simple toothbrush would clean as well, but the music playing while they brush makes it fun."
1,Almost Speechless!,"WOW!!! Never in my history of RC playing have I ever found something so utterly worthless as this piece of garbage. I can't even find something worse in Kmart or Radio shack. At all costs, do not waste your money on this!!!!"
3,CCNP,"Hi,This study guide is OK, but my impression is that you can not pass the test with this alone. There is lots of errors in the study material and review-tests, especially I found the ""Dial"" chapter could be much better. The review tests are much more simple than the ""real"" test, but you can still learn your weak areas and study them further. If you are studying for CCNP and like ""e-learning"" this is a good supplement."
4,A Dream House for a Big Girl with a Child's Heart,This doll house kit comes with the pushed out pieces that one needs to build the basic doll house. It is much more complicated then it sounds and is a time project that requires the skills of an adult. There is a great deal more that can be done to such a doll house such as electric plug ins and wall paper. This kit does not come with roof tiles. It is the tip of the iceberg so to speak. However it is beautiful once assembled which my husband and I are not quit finished with yet. If you love to sand and paint and love three dimensional puzzles you will love it. I do not consider this a child's toy.
1,Do Not Buy This Product!!!!,"I bought this to build with my 10 year old granddaughter. It has been an absolute nightmare!!! The quality of the wood is inferior. Nothing lines up correctly. If I wasn't making this for my granddaughter, I would have burned it. It is so disappointing to put in so much time and money into a piece of junk. Giving this product one star is too much."
4,Break out the air-guitars,"Before this album, I'd already written off the Black Crowes as nothing more than a band that would be amazing if they just stuck to covers, instead of relying on ham-handed Stones/Zep re-hashes. Say what you like, the critics were never pissed off at the BCs because they were influenced by the Stones, they were pissed off because there really wasn't a shred of originality or uniqueness in their delivery.As for Jimmy Page, we all know the (mostly) rotten fruits he's reaped since the demise of Zeppelin. And at his age, he can't possibly be expected to live up to his own past, so he doesn't try. Backed by the Crowes however, he can pick his spots and still relatively shine.As a result, the album is great fun, with particular emphasis placed on the second CD, which (from start to finish) is loaded with energy, updated riffs, and--let's face it--wistful memories. From the blues covers, to the Zep b-sides (wise choice), the result is one of the best live albums of the 90s."
3,Not the best band in the world,Buy this CD if you are a fan of the best guitarist in the world - Jimmy is absolutely brilliant - BUT don't expect too much - this is NOT 'the boys'. Anyone who thinks Chris Robinson approaches The great Robert Antony (blessed be his name)needs the wax taking out of their ears - As they said when Bonzo left us 'things will never be the same so...'. Buy this anyway! - it's a joy to hear Jimmy in full flight even if I find the vocals grate...but if you weren't at Earls Court or Knebworth then perhaps you won't notice.
5,Beyond Fantastic!!,"I love Led Zeppelin and very much enjoy The Black Crowes and this album blew my @#%! mind!!! The song selection and playing are beyond perfection. This is the best live album released this decade,so far, and is certainly one of my most played albums ever. I take this album to work, on vacation, pretty much everywhere. Definately one of the albums where I got my money's worth and then some. This one is always on my player and never gets tired.The Crowes wiseley avoid the more obvious tracks like ""Stairway To Heaven"", instead focusing on lesser played deep cuts like ""What Is And What Should Never Be"", ""Out On The Tiles"" and old Yardbirds songs like ""Shapes Of Things To Come"". I first heard of this album when it was only available through The Crowes web site and almost ordered it, but was glad I did not, because when it was released in stores, it had bonus tracks on it. In short, this a must have classic."
4,Live at the Greek,"Live at the Greek is a collaborative live effort between the Black Crowes and Jimmy Page former member of Led Zeppelin. The album was released 1999 and had 2 singles released ""What is and What should never be"" and ""Ten Years Gone"". The album itself peaked at #24 in the German album charts. Whilst the singles peaked at #13 and #33 on the US Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart. The booklet is quite sparse with some black and white photos and a very nice cover. 4/5."
4,Zepplin Revisited,"All right, it's not Zepllin's BBC Sessions, but it still kicks! If you're a die hard Zeppeling fan, then you may you might have shed a tear at No Quarter. Great creative minds still, but man, what happened to Plant? This CD has Jimmy Paige's brilliant mind mixed with new blood and a fresh voice. If you have ever heard an interview looking back at Led Zepllelin, you hear some reference to blending of the different styles of the various musicians. Jimmy Paige did the same here, the CD has definite ties to the Zeppelin style, but it encorporates the Black Crowe style nicely. Great CD for any Zeppelin fan, or just anyone with good musical taste."
4,Like meeting an old freind after all these years,"I once read an insightful review of Zeppelin where the reviewer noted that what seperated them from all the ""heavy metal"" pretenders was the solid bottom created by J.P. Jones and Bonzo Bonham. Here the Black Crowes have paid careful attention to this aspect in backing Jimmy with a thunderous bass and drums attack which rekindle, to me at least, the excitement of a Zep live show in their heyday. Jimmy seems to play with a gleeful abandon freed up by expert backing in the secondary guitar parts. I was left wishing for more and Custard Pie still knocks me flat on my keister 20+ years after the fact."
5,Electric,"I have this album since it was available from musicmaker.com and it is a must have for classic rock fans. The Black Crows offer an excelent band scenario for Jimmy Page to play. They play with fury and with a complete love for the music. Most interesting is that they are not just doing Led Zeppelin covers but giving them a new treatment with much respect. Black Crows singer escapes the ""I want to sound like Robert Plant"" style with his interpretation by just being an sounding like just any other Black Crows recording.If you are looking for some classic and powerfull rock and roll, just buy and enjoy, Play it loud."
5,A MUST HAVE!,"One of the best live albums I have! The sound quality is fantastic, almost like you're there."
5,JIMMY + CROWES = MAGIC,"Ever wonder what Led Zeppelin would have sounded like if Jimmy had gotten Steve Marriott of Humble Pie(Pie's manager threatened to break Jimmy's fingers)? In the early days of the Crowes,they were compared to Lynyrd Skynyrd, because of their Southern background. Ludicrous, to be sure. Few noticed Chris Robinson's eerie vocal resemblance to Marriott(who spent his last years in the Crowes' hometown of Atlanta,coincidentally). If you have doubts, listen, for instance, to Pie's classic ""30 Days in the Hole"". That being said, this is something of a historic musical ""what if"". Jimmy and the Crowes together are a rock'n'roll machine. If you are a Jimmy Page or Crowes fan, you owe it to yourself to own this CD."
2,Poor recording spoils great potential,"I was so excited for this album to come out, being a longtime fan of the Crowes and Led Zeppelin. Unfortunately, all the good things that could have come out of this performance never materialized. The recording quality is substandard. Chris' fantastic vocals are largely drowned out by the music. There are no strong guitar solos highlighting Page. In short, I am surprised that they have actually published this recording. I would recommend listening to a friend's copy before you buy. Decide whether you can deal with the lousy sound quality."
2,Studio music.,"Sounds cluttered. It's hard to get the feeling of a live performance accross without distortion. Much of Page's skill was his perfection in the studio. Maybe he could have cleaned this one up but then it wouldn't have been ""live""."
2,PAGE + CROWES=OVERBLOWN,"What a blatant attempt for Page to yet again cash in on the Led Zeppelin name. It was bad enough when he did ""Kashmir"" rap-style, but this is much worse. As for the Black Crowes, I was never big on them, but my opinions have changed in two ways after hearing this. First of all, they are better musicians than I thought. However, the singer of the Crowes sounds horrible live. I never thought he was much of a vocalist, but I didn't think he was this bad. Most fans will like this simply because it's Jimmy Page and it's Led Zeppelin, but not me. I will stick to the original Zep cd's."
3,An odd mix... far from the hammer of the Gods,"Listening to this disc is a simple pleasure. As a huge Zepp fan I have purchased many imports and strained releases that were worse than this live recording.You have to respect Jimmy Page- he loves to play and if not for the reclusive nature of Robert Plant there would probably have been new albums of Page/Plant work all over the years since the Mighty Groups demise.As much as some tire of the praise of Led Zeppelin I feel that they are STILL underappreciated. The group was 4 brilliant players that each added to the magic... I love the Black Crowes but as they tore into each track on this LIVE AT THE GREEK RELEASE I realized over and over again how special Robert Plant is in music.I wish that he would make himself more available for studio work. ""Walking Into Clarksdale"" was full of promise... I am thankful for Jimmy Page's ability to have fun with the classics... and I am thankful that there is no David Coverdale in sight."
4,Celebrate Jimmy Page' s Genius,"The best song on this double CD is Celebration Day. It blows away the studio version on LZ3 and shows clearly why some bands (The Who, Nirvana, Black Crowes) sound way better live. Put this CD on track #1 and turn it up!"
5,black crowes + jimmy page = rock,"I was lucky enough to see black crowes and jimmy page live at nissan pavillion, and i was completely blown away. They played pretty much only zeppelin songs (a good thing although the black crowes are good too) and the band played the songs perectly. Oh and i assure you jimmy page has not forgotten the ultra-killer zeppelin licks."
1,Absolute Rubbish,"Jimmy Page's brilliant guitar talents can't overcome the completely lame singing and a sluggish rhythm section (not to mention a badly recorded, poorly mixed tech-job).Forget this one and get a real Led Zeppelin CD."
5,Best live performance recording,"First and foremost, this is the best recording of a live performance I've ever heard (I'm 65 and have heard a lot). It's obvious to me that anything Kevin Shirley mixes is going to be top shelf (listen to Black Country Communion or Black Stone Cherry). Zep fans will understand how special this union of Jimmy Page and the Black Crowes was. The layering of multiple guitars gives the sound here unparalleled fullness. You'll recognize all the songs and I'm so pleased they included ""In My Time of Dying"" and ""Nobody's Fault But Mine"", my favorites. Every instrument in this mix can be heard and appreciated. Regrettable there wasn't a camera rolling during this all too short tour."
5,The greatest live cd that nobody really knows about.,"This cd was a bust on the internet only site due to not a lot of people were hip to the net as they are now. Then it got picked up by a actual label... a tour was set in motion..they were set for an appearance on the Tonight show to kick off the tour, and then Jimmy Page hurt his back and the tour was scrapped and the label did nothing to promote it. The Rock and Roll Gods gave us this amazing gift..play it LOUD ( of course) and enjoy."
5,THIS ALBUM RATES IN MY TOP 3 OF ALL TIME!!!,"If you like Led Zeppelin & you like the Black Crowes...that's nice. But if you like the best kick*ss music in the world.....buy this cd set! What you get here is an ultimate mix of songs (many that are not the standard Led Zep radio tunes) busted out in PERFECT TIGHT arrangement. Custard Pie, Ten Years Gone, The Lemmon Song....not to mention the countless others. (By the way, if you buy the ""Import"" version you get two extra tracks -- Not what you's guess either & totally friggin' awesome!).THIS IS BY FAR, THE 'BEST' LIVE ALBUM I'VE EVER HEARD ON CD.This CD set gets BETTER every time I listen to it. You can't go wrong with this. Buy it, crank it up & rip off the knob. You'll be happy you did!It's one of those albums that sounds better loud & you find yourself playing either air-guitar or air-drums to. Excellent!"
5,great,"jimmy page joins forces with the black crows! who could think that this would go sour? this 2 cd set is so refreashing! rich robinson does a great job on the guitar work here he shines. and audley freed, they hold all the rhythms down while Jimmy page go's off! Chris robinson does a great job on vocals! what I like the most about this cd is these guys do the remake of OH WELL, fleetwood mac tune. SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME,yardbirds this is a must have for the collection. ENJOY!"
1,Really bad sound quality,The sound quality is really poor. The album sounds like it was mastered from a hand held tape recorder. Don't waste youe money.
1,weird cd,"I like this music a lot. It's not available in MP3 format so I bought this ""enhanced"" CD to make my own MP3s. Well, this CD just takes over your computer. It downloads an exe file that I can't even figure out how to turn off in my Windows 7 computer; I have to stop it with control/alt/delete. You can't click through the tracks, and you certainly can't burn MP3s. I'm surprised they put out such a stupid product. It seems like the kind of silly thing companies put out when people first started playing CDs on computers 15 years ago."
2,Not Worthy of Hellboy,"As a huge Hellboy fan, I put off reading this book because I loved the comics so much and did not think a prose writer could capture the dark but wry tone so easily set by Mignola with his fantastic graphic artwork and minimal use of word balloons. I feel my hesitation was justified. ""Lost Army"" did not feel like a Hellboy story at all - from the fairly unoriginal and frankly boring lost army in the desert premise to the superfluous lake monster to the weak anticlimatic ending (the mysterious glow is...? ). It was like a simplistic Hardy Boys mystery. But just when you are feeling like you are in PG action horror territory complete with zombie warriors and Krull-like giant spider web scenes, Golden throws in a disturbing and out-of-nowhere attempted rape just to make things more ""adult"" (or something). This uneven tone is fairly consistent and although the relationship between Hellboy and his ex-flame is fun to read - the best thing about this book are the illustrations."
2,Super Reader,"A bit on the flat side. A lot of short, stilted, sentences at times, that read like it has been dumbed down for 5 year olds to read. Perhaps it had been butchered down to size by editor and/or writer to fit in plenty of Mignola artwork, and for a novel, there is plenty.Avoid anyone in the Middle East area called Hazred, and don't go on away team missions with Hellboy.Evil sorcerers, giant spiders, jackal-men amulets, and 50,000 desert zombies. Even if you are a super-competent MI5 field agent, or allied soldier you are in for a world of hurt in this sort of scenario."
4,Hellboy Mythos,"If you are a Hellboy Efficienado, you'll adore this book. Otherwise you should probably just borrow it from the library."
4,Lovely Earrings,"I agree with the first two reviewers. These are lovely sterling silver earrings. High quality, but with a tiny stone, thus the four star rating. Regardless, these are definitely worth having!!"
5,God is Faithful,"I first heard this song at the Bring Back the Joy conference...No song has ever touched me like this one! I have the album and play it regularly. I have looked for an accompaniment tape or sheet music, as I must sing this song! Is there one out there somewhere?"
2,Put me to sleep...,"I bought this CD for 1 song alone, and even that song seemed like it had been mellowed out from the radio version. Anyway, I hate to criticize any Christian music, but honestly, this one's good for when you're READY TO GO TO BED!"
5,"Lovely, heavenly, Celtic Christian CD","A lush, ethereal experience. Like being lifted into the hands of God on the wings of angels....The only song that I found a little off for me was Trapeze, although the song was beautiful music and words, I guess the metaphor just didn't work with me. But the remainder of the CD was heaven sent, a sweet lull into God's presence."
5,A very nice cd,"""Hope"" is a very nice cd. The songs are indeed hopefull. It's strengt lay in the sort of music in wich the songs are carried out. But most it lays in the way in wich Sheila is singing them. For example: when she is singing 'I know that my Redeemer lives', then it's a complete cohesion of here voice, the meening of the words and the music. Very nice!"
4,Lobo 101,"Excellent starting point for wanna-be Lobo fans, you have the hand it to the editors of this compilation for wrapping up all those obscure Lobo cameos and dorky (you should see his hair in the Omega Men series!) first appearances in typical twisted Lobo fashion. Atlhough there's no Simon Bisley art except for the cover, it is still a definitive collection about the Main Man. Great companion piece to Lobo: The Last Czarnian."
1,How to find God? Do it yourself!,"Yet another self help book. And as I ploughed through it I kept asking...when will I learn that the only people these books help are the authors not to mention their pocketbooks? I have always admired Joan Borysenko for her work with the mind/body connection and have read several of her books over the years. Because of my present state of mind, this one looked promising...but I guess I've come farther than I thought because all it did was prove to me that the only way to find your own path is to find it. Voluminous words, (no matter how intelligent and well intentioned the author,) preached on a page cannot lead you to your path to whatever...God included. This book like too many others is nothing more than the author's expiation.....how she found her way, about her experiences and epiphanies. It made me realize how tired I am of reading about other people's journeys....No more self help books ....I'm cured."
1,Find your faith first,"In previous books, Ms Borysenko has expressed her insight on how to help women with body/mind healing. Her books were timely and helpful to many people. In this latest book she attempts to speak to the spirituality of her Christian women friends, encouraging them to find spirituality in purely ""female"" everyday moments. While she does offer some information and history on God and spirituality, I am now more inclined to go back and read the bible and the writings of Mahatma Gandhi to support my own faith and spirituality. I was disappointed with the superficial tone of the book."
3,"Not as good as ""Gladiator School""","I find myself in a tricky situation: an ancient historian who also finds that ancient cultures can be sexual turn-ons. In his previous book, ""Gladiator School,"" Elliott benefited from little surviving knowledge about how exactly the gladiatorial centers functioned and as long as he kept the Roman as ""masters"" there was little issue with just having historical fun. However, how Roman conquered, what they did with those they conquered, and the more general ideas about sexuality in the Roman world make this second book less realistic to the trained eye. Now the sex is still pretty hot but I found myself saying ""no, that's not right, that's not likely"" so many times that I was distracted. Basically the plot falls into a sort of ""Spartacus"" model by the last fifth of the book though without a sad ending. So if you aren't as picky as me with ""historical information"" and you liked the roughness and grandeur of his first book, then you should like this one too."
4,"Aspar, a defeated king, is a slave...","Aspar is a king without a kingdom, defeated by the Roman army. In order to survive, he submits his body but not his soul to one Roman conquereor after another. The victors take great delight in his firm young body and they give him the nomiker of 'Slave King.'But a series of events lead him to become the most sought after prostitute in Rome.It was a good story but I did not feel the synopsis of prostitution, sex slave really delivered on that point."
3,Stephen Ames Berry--biography,"The biographical facts are correct. My pollyannish views of the publishing industry have however, very much changed since those long ago days. POD and eBooks are almost here as The Way to reach an audience--they just need to hone their distribution skills. The Old Publishers have been so absorbed and consolidated that they're now essentially but one publisher: folks, monopolies are not innovators. But all ancient regimes eventially totter and fall of their own internal contradictions. Like many of the Old Authors, I look forward to dawn of a new and brighter day. (I would be amazed if this gets published. :) )"
2,Book is a little dated - some useful tips,"The book is really dated as it is from 1995. Most of the advice is about how to find a hair stylist. There are some tips that are good in the book but nothing that you wouldn't find on the internet. Most of the styles are dated as there are a lot of shags and bobs from the 90's. The ""big hair"" styles are more interesting just because they are ""big hair"" and I always wondered what it took to tease and get it that way. Small trade paperback you can read in less than an hour."
2,Not Very good,"I was really looking forward to this and was going to mix it with some fresh cream. This was for torting a white cake. But when I opened the jar and tasted it, it was awful! Tasted spoiled."
1,"the movies are ok,but the transfers are the pits!!!!!",i'd give the three movies in order1.cold sweat=2 1/22.guns of diablo=33.someone behind the door=2i give this hopless transfer no stars as they look like they fished their copy out of the river before they dubed it. skip this and look for better copies!!!!
1,Absolutely the WORST toaster ever !,"I requested this toaster for Christmas two years ago in order to toast longer slices of bread (and can't believe we're still putting up with this attractive, disfunctional piece of junk!). No matter how the bread is positioned, or how thick it is, toast comes out so unevenly done that we have to scrape or cut blackened and burnt ridges and ends. In desperation, we now set the control at lowest setting and continue to re-toast on Reheat (an admittedly nice feature), repositioning bread each time, until we get something resembling toasted bread.It's good to see a couple reviewers have had better results, but this item has destroyed any faith I had in the Cuisnart name. I won't be taking a chance on any of their other appliances.Yes, ours is the chrome CPT-90."
1,"Slow, clumsy controls and it fell apart.","Had this for probably 4 years, so longevity may be a bit much to expect for this price range.However there are some other problems.It takes up a lot of space, both on the counter top and in the cupboard.Maintaining that big expanse of mirror chrome is a pain, just one fingerprint makes it look dirty.The power cord is placed so that, in order not to have it under the hot toaster, the toaster is positioned so that the control buttons are always on the far end.The control buttons are partially blocked by the push down handle.This thing is slower than a wet week. It seems like it takes hours to to lightly brown (setting 2) just 2 pieces of toast. Some of the heating element wires have fallen off ours now, but I'm pleased.Now I can go buy something decent."
2,Doesn't work as good as it looks!,The toaster is beautiful and works ok. Has a problem with not toasting on both sides part of the time. I would have expected more from cuisinart!
2,"Poor, uneven toasting","Worst toaster I've ever had, when it comes to even toasting. The bottom 1/2 to 1 inch of bread is almost completely not toasted. I've sent complaint to Cuisinart but have yet to hear back from them. I've enjoyed other products from Cuisinart but not this. Not worth the money and I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone in the market for a toaster."
2,Disappointed,"We have been disappointed with this toaster. It does not toast even and usually burns one part of the bread, while the other part is barely toasted. I called the company about it thinking it may be just this toaster but they offered no help. I got the feeling of ""Oh well, too bad"". Also, the numbers to choose how many slices to toast are VERY hard to read as they are just imprinted into the metal with no color difference. We have been using it unhappily for a year and I am thinking of buying a new one already."
2,Looks great--poor quality,"Loved the fact that this toaster takes long slices and chrome styling--too few around. Knob came off after a couple of months and the mechanism no longer works to keep the bread down after less than a year. Went shopping for a new toaster and found this model on the shelf with a broken knob--it's obviously a faulty feature. Toaster never browned our favorite long sourdough slices evenly. Still looking for a 4-slice, long slot, chrome toaster."
1,Nice Looking . . . Poor Working . . .,There are numerous problems with this toaster. The toast is always uneven -- generally 1/2 or 3/4 of one side of the bread slice. The lever broke after 3 months of use. The defrost light turns on without pressing the button and stays on randomly for days at a time regardless of the reset button. The crumb tray does not catch all of the crumbs. The toaster sparks both when the toast goes down and when it pops up. I am going to throw it away. I will never buy a Cusinart toaster again.
1,Poorly built,The mechanism that holds the toast down failed after about a year. Then the knob fell off. It is cheaply made.
1,Dont waste your money,"Unfortunately, I am about to trash this overpriced, overtouted toaster. After a month, the lever knob broke. More often than not, the toast came out unevenly toasted--with a good half or more at times not toasted whatsoever--even though the proper switch was set for the number of slices. Most recently, the toaster has become totally worthless, when, even set at the lowest setting of 1, it consistently burns toast to a crisp! Nice fire hazard with smoking and all if one doesnt watch the thing religiously. Pretty scary!"
2,Slow and uneven toasting,"I am now looking for another toaster, which is why I happened to see this one and decided to see how others rated it. I received it as a wedding gift three years ago and only keep it because I have felt too guilty to buy a new one. The reason I gave it two stars is that it looks pretty good, has space for four slices, and hasn't broken down on me. But... since the day I unwrapped it, it has toasted slowly and unevenly. My husband finally said, ""when will you stop complaining and just buy a new one?"" So here I am. I thought I was on safe ground registering for a Cuisinart, and will probably even buy another Cuisinart of a different kind, but overall I've been very disappointed."
4,Great product!,"I bought this for my 8-year old son to provide a tool for him to improve his accuracy in shooting. In just a couple of uses, he was able to start hitting the corners on a regular bais; not always scoring, but hitting the general area. More importantly, the target provided a 'fun' level that turned a regular practice into a game. Before having the target, I would play goalie while he shot on goal. Now we play offense together, passing back and forth to each, before a shot is taken.The plastic is a thick material that is very durable and holds up to the elements. The sleeves and velcro straps are sufficient."
1,amazon sent me one that looked completely different than this one.,amazon sent me one that looked completely different than this one. It is black and white and the goalie is in a completely different position. Very disappointed birthday boy.
2,dont make my mistake,"I purchased this item thinking I was getting the goal with it. Dont make the same mistake, this is just the mat in front of the goal. Way overpriced for what you get."
4,Great DVD. A must for collector,"My only complaint is the camera angle was not so good. They only showed briefly Richie Blackmore during his solos. Instead, they showed R. Glover at those times. Why the hell they showed the bass player during lead guitar solos? No idea!I wish they had filmed ""Made in Japan"". That would have been great. Too bad."
4,Just wonder,"This dvd is great, but i felt like i get only half from each concert. The Denmark Show is a great SHOW, it's terrific and longg, but with poor camera work and black and white quality. The New York show is brilliant, way better camera work, but the songs are edit and the whole things are last only 25 minuits.I just wonder why the California Jam dvd which should be released since Nov.21 are not on sale in Amazon yet???"
4,"Great Music, Bad Camera Work In Spots","The set list is tremendous and seeing the boys from their heyday in 1972 - 1974 is just awesome. The major complaint concerning this DVD concerns the camera work. For the first four or five songs of the Denmark show, the director must have been tripping. When Blackmore launches into a solo, the camera lingers on Gillan, then catches a bit of Glover, then back to Gillan, etc. Later on there is great footage of Blackmore and Lord soloing, and the camera work during Ian Paice's drum solo is superb - as is the solo itself. My God! How does anyone move sticks that fast?Well worth buying, but be prepared to curse a few times during the opening half-hour as you HEAR Blackmore but don't see him."
4,Must have CD for Destinos Workbook / Study Guide,"This is a review of the Audio CD program (lessons 1-26) that accompanies Destinos Workbook / Study Guide Vol. 1. There are 7 Audio CDs.In order to use this Audio CD program, you will need to purchase the Workbook / Study Guide Vol. 1. Be sure to reference ISBN number 0072497114 to make sure that you purchase the correct Workbook / Study Guide.The Audio CDs and the Workbook / Study Guide are very effective in the learning process. It does, however, take discipline to keep focus and not get frustrated.In addition to the Audio CDs and the Workbook / Study Guide Vol. 1 (ISBN 0072497114), I also use Destinos Student Edition w/ Listening Comprehension Audio CD (ISBN 0072525363) for independent learning. Of course, I also use the 52-episode Destinos soap opera videos / dvds."
5,Wonderful,I had this book as a child growing up. My best friend has three children and I could not think of a more wonderful Bible story book to give them. Lots of wonderful pictures and the teaching stay in line with the Bible.
4,At Long Last Like,"This is my favorite Shakespeare play, and I've often wondered why no one has ever made another movie version in all this time. This adaption is dated but generally well done, with an actively moving camera and some scattered attempts at making it more than merely a ""filmed play."" If you've seen it on TV then you probably remember the sound as awful and the picture pretty blurry (like many public domain movies, awful prints are everywhere). So know that this dvd is from an excellent print, with the sound much clearer, (though still not great) and the picture 10 times better than I have seen. So if you are wondering if this dvd is worth getting even if only to replace your inaudible old VHS copy, then let me assure you Arden has never looked better, nor Elisabeth Bergner's shrill voice more effortlessly deciphered. I would not change it."
1,One star is too many,"A terrible transfer, so bad it must be seen to believed - the film looks and sounds like it was made underwater. This is not a critique of an enjoyable, if flawed film, but of this particular DVD."
2,Try the 1978 version with Helen Mirren,"This is not a bad play, but it feels tight. I wanted to see it to compare with the 1978 version with Helen Mirren (just about impossible to find - try Ambrose Video and sit down for the price). The setting is forcefully lush, but feels plastic. My general view is that Shakespeare needs to be ""slowed down"", performance-wise and most old movies (40-50 years) seem rushed."
4,"Old-fashioned, but fun","This version of ""As You Like It"" has not aged well. The modern approach to Shakespeare, with more natural dialog and realistic costuming, has left the tight-wearing overly theatrical players of old looking a bit foolish. They strut around the stage with obvious gusto and verve, but they just never connect.With that in mind, ""As You Like It"" can be fun. The play itself is a bit silly, and the actors even sillier. The director made no attempt to disguise the feminine status of Elizabeth Bergener. She remains a pretty girl in boys clothes with a screeching soprano voice. To his credit, Olivier plays it as straight as an oak, and never for a minute doubts her ill-conceived charade. Jacques is in full motley, making his presence in Arden forest even more absurd.Lacking any other version on DVD, ""As You Like It"" contains a certain charm. Just be prepared. Your ""willful suspension of disbelief"" has never been so sorely tested."
2,Sir Laurence Olivier's first film,"Elisabeth Bergner as Rosalind gets top billing in this 1936 B&W film. I love William Shakespeare. His mastery of language and plot is always (so far) a joy. When I bought this, I had just seen my son as Amiens, Lord Attending Exiled Duke, and the character of Rosalind played by a very pretty, perky and sassy young actress. After that performance, this DVD version was painful to watch and I never got through it. Sir Laurence is good, if not entirely believable as Orlando, but the film appears to be cast as a vehicle for Elisabeth Bergner though for the life of me I can't imagine why. Born in the Ukraine, and having first appeared in the Berlin silent film ""Der Evangelimann"" in 1923, Elisabeth Bergner acts like a silent actress, and ""As You Like It"" appears to be her first English-speaking role. Still, as Shakespeare goes, this is a funny and thoroughly enjoyable story with several clever twists. It's a Shakespeare play that cries out for Kenneth Branagh."
3,2 of 3 OK,"I gave this as a gift to a friend that likes chill music and she says he liked 2 of the 3 DJ's, not sure which was which."
5,"Ben Pollack Vol. 1, 1926-1928","Outstanding!! This music is part of our heritage and it is truly amazing in its structure. It laid the foundations for the swing era and was in itself an art form. It is above all else, happy music that is fun to listen to."
5,Good Study Aid,"This is an awful good book that really helped me in my quest for CCDA. I failed my furst try at the exam, picked up this study guide, and used it to success! The exam is CASE STUDY, CASE STUDY, CASE STUDY... This text helped with many concepts that are vital to pass the exam."
2,"Very bad organisation, practice questions not helpful","There is a wealth of information in this book, but it is all over the place; organisation of chapters according to certification objectives leads to much repetition. Rather than waste your time trying to sort it out, my advice is to use some other text instead. Furthermore, there are not many practice questions based on design scenarios in the CD-ROM, and a few are simply silly e.g. ""Ethernet was invented by whom?"". I must say that I am really impressed by those reviewers new to networking who used this book and passed on their first try.If you really must use this book, it will be good to brush up your knowledge of networking protocols and Cisco equipment elsewhere."
4,CCDA in three weeks,"Today (March 5,2003) was the last chance that one had to take this test but you can buy this book really [inexpensively] and it will help you when you take the new test. You should read more than just this book. I took it two days ago and passed on my first attempt. You need to do a lot of reading and you must FULLY understand the material to have a chance at this one. Lots of case studies and this is what makes it a tough test. Good luck"
5,"Musicians, Musicians' Lives","A pleasure to read this book. I listen to a classical music station which includes interesting facts about the musicians' private lives. One day a guest mentioned that she knew where the host was obtaining these interesting facts. So it is a secret no longer; it's this book. Lives of the Musicians is light reading with approx. 2 pages of facts per musician, so it is not an in-depth look at their private lives; however put it on your ""Fun"" reading list. It is a highly amusing book and a great source of dinner conversation. Also Check out Lives of the Artists:Good Times, Bad Times (and What the Neigbors Thought)"
5,restoration and relaxation!!!!,"I found this CD in a country store in New Hampshire. Listening to snippets from two tracks were enough to sell me. The gentle guitar and violin cuts provide a wonderful background for work, relaxation or reflection. I played this as I toured New Hampshire and Maine during the two weeks following the attacks on New York City and the Pentagon. This music was the antidote my soul needed."
2,And Then There Were Two...,"On its first two albums, Citizen Cain was a five piece band consisting of crack musicians. Those albums are absolute pinnacles of 90s progressive rock, reminiscent of and as excellent as early 70s Genesis.On Stones, the band for unknown reasons cut back to two members. And just as when Genesis started thinning its ranks, the results are diminished proportionately.There's no structure to the album (not even the song titles) and narry a hook to be found. Further, there's a weird evil soaked in it: I always felt giant, plague-carrying ravens would start pecking at my eyeballs if I listened to it.Buy 'Serpents in Camoflouge' and 'Somewhere But Yesterday' instead - 5 stars each."
4,Mini Hockey Net,My son really enjoys this mini hockey net. He is 12 years old and he and his friend each have one and they have a mini knee hockey game.
2,hochey for kids,"I was very disapointed by the product; it doesn't list any size, so when it came, I was surprised to see it so small, even for a child"
4,Review for hockey net,The hockey net had very small sticks but that is the only con about it and the price wasn't really reasonable either.
4,Go Sabres!,"For those hockey Dads looking to get their kid interested early in the sport I recommend this net however be forewarned that the sticks are very strong. My 2 year old has tested the walls, the furniture and hardwood floors.Other than that It's GAME ON!!"
4,Good for the price,"We bought this for our 5 & 6 year olds, and for the price it's been a fun toy. We set it up in our basement, and the kids play with it whenever Dad watches the hocky game on TV. Mom and Dad try to get down on the ground with the kids and play sometimes too, but we usually end up playing on our knees because the sticks are so short. I wouldn't recommend it for kids much older than this because the set is on the smaller side."
5,excellent series,This is a thoroughly enjoyable series. I just wish there were more. Excellent stories and great acting. No special effects just a good mystery in an Irish village with a believable officer.
5,Dogs love these toys!,"My two dogs (a Bichon and a Shitzu) love these toys! We have one which is really LARGE and three others at Medium Size like this one. All day long there is ""Cawing"" going on - but prefer it to the squeakers. LOL~ Extremely HARD to find at your local stores unless you're lucky!"
1,Size,"I thought this would be the Henrietta that measures about 16"" or so that I have bought in the past from Pet SuperMarket."
5,must have for lovers of devotions,Like devotional material? Like brief readings? Like snippets packed with non cliche wisdom? Like the mystics. Yes to any of those makes this a book you should have. Accessible and stimulating - a ready companion. Excellent for a man or woman.I miss this when I don't read it
1,Missing Pieces,The puzzle has missing pieces and no phone number to get the missing pieces. Nothing worse than a puzzle that you cannot finish as it is not complete. For the price it looks good but not worth it unless it has all the pieces.
3,Keith's review,"I think this book was good, but not edge of your seat kind of good. If I were to give this book a rating on a scale of one to ten, I would give it an g. I mean, sure it was a true story, but if it weren't true, it would probably be more exciting. The story basically tells about a boy who was lost for nine days. The story tells it from his point of view and what really happened during those nine days. For example, he had to survive some close encounters with deadly animals and a few incidents in the rushing rapids of a stream. I don't want to give too much away but I will tell you that what this boy went through is amazing. This book would for someone who likes true amazing stories about people that push themselves to their limit both physically and mentally. That's just what this book is about, a boy who pushes himself to his furthest possible limits."
5,Heartwarming story,"This is a fantastic story about the true struggle a twelve-year-old boy endured for nine days while lost in the Maine wilderness. While reading the story, you can't help but feel yourself being right there with him. It will really open your eyes and make you appreciate the food we have on the table and roofs over our head each day. It is a real eye opener with a heartwarming ending. A must read for children and adults."
4,interesting,Nice story if you like adventures. The boy in this story was 12-13. If you like daring events you would like this story and it is true. The story tells how he survives. It is reading for 9 and higher.
3,Bad Design - Tin means teeny tiny,"I played the older version that came in a cardboard box and had full sized score pad. I lost that version in a move. Years later, I come back to buy this game again. This new version in the collectors tin means they sized everything pretty small. It looks like travel Phase 10 or pocket Phase 10. I had to go online and print out the real full-sized scorepad so I could keep score without pulling out my hair. You can find them at centralconnector. Those little spaces on the scorepad are not big enough to really add up the scores. The best thing to do if you want this game is to go on Ebay and search for an older version. More than likely you won't be able to find it new but maybe in really great condition. I could not find this game at any of our Walmarts. They only sell the card game. Our local Targets don't carry it either. This is one of the few places to get this game from."
4,Phase 10,"Great Game. Very easy to play. I have been playing it pretty consistant with my 10yr old son, and it has challeneged his math skills and has improved. only complaint would be the paint on the die wear quickly. Other than that its a really fun game, for 2-4 players!"
2,Rename Phase 10 Dice Replacement Kit,"We bought 5 Phase 10 Dice Games to give as gifts. These are not like the original game. They did not contain the players reference cards, in addition the score sheets were so small and the type was illegible. This was a disappointment and we can recommend this as only a dice replacement kit not as a complete game."
3,Disappointed in product,"When I purchased this Phase 10 Dice game from Amazon, I assumed I would be getting the same product as the original Phase 10 Dice game I bought several years ago - in a box, with dice, score pads, and CUP to shake the dice (like the cup in the Yahtze games). I paid $7.00 for that game (at an Albertson's Grocery store, no less!) just as I did this one (plus shipping/handling - ouch!). Turns out that the dice game I bought from Amazon just a month ago is in a little tin box, with tiny little score pads (much smaller than my original game's pads), the 10 dully colored dice - and NO CUP! What are you supposed to shake the dice in? I suppose any cup will do, but I still feel cheated because the game isn't complete - and I paid a LOT more money (with S/H) for a lot less. (But what can I say - I love the game itself. Just beware, buyer, you're not getting the whole deal.)"
3,Only so-so,"I was disappointed with this video. It just mentioned superficially, without giving any detail, many of the features of this device. If you want an in-depth covergage, you must go elsewhere."
2,Not as good as EDT,"This lotion is OK... I missed the perfume that has been diconnected, thought lotion would do the trick but, alas, it's not even close."
4,My four year-old picked this book out and loves it!,"And, so did our puppy (she devoured it) that's why we are buying another. It's well worth the money, and Amazon.com has the best price around. This a a great book for little kids who love animals. The pictures are colorful and the text is simple and catchy."
1,Not for fans!,"This was disapointing! ""A full colour live performance picture on the disc"" A ... picture of Em on the cd? The sound is bad and you cant here all the questions! And Em starts all his answers with AAAAAAAHHHH Bla Bla......! Sorry fans don`t waist your money on this record!!!"
2,"Em rocks, this not so much",I am a huge fan of Em and I found this CD to be disapointing. The questions are hard to hear along with the answers. The track titles are misleading as to what you expect to hear from Em. Everything that was said had been said before and any true Eminem fan would already know this. My advice is to not buy this CD.
1,A joke,"Eminem is a joke. He is tasteless, and annoying. Its hard to imagine how anyone could find this person entertaining. All he puts out is noise and he will wind up the Next Vanilla Ice.Enjoy your stardom while it last's......[weak]."
1,Author promote abusive practice,"The author helps to spread the unvalidated and abusive practice of ""Attachment Therapy"" (aka Holding Therapy, Rage Reduction, Nancy Thomas parenting, etc.) and nonsense beliefs about attachment. It even refers people to the Attachment Center at Evergreen (renamed Institute for Attachment and Child Development after the death of Candace Newmaker at the hands of their previous clinical supervisor). This bogus practice has been responsible for numerous criminal child abuse and death cases, many involving Russian adoptees.The author either approves of this practice or he hasn't done his homework. Either way, that should be a BIG RED FLAG to readers."
4,Perhaps the Best Foreign Adoption Guide Ever Written,"This book is extremely comprehensive and should be read early in the process. Through no fault of the author's, some material is out of date because the Russian Laws have changed since the book was written (i.e. two trips are now required). Outside of that, my wife and I found the book to be the best resource we could have possibly found. It contains helpful information and lists of questions to ask medical professionals, children's home directors, and adoption agency guides. The best thing about the book is that the material is broken down into simple sections and is presented in an easy to understand manner. I don't have enough room to write all the good things about this book, but it should be required reading for anyone considering adopting from Russia or other countries."
4,Nuts and bolts,"Covers every aspect of Russian adoption, from INS forms to selecting an agency to travel in Russia. I thought I had a grasp on Russian adoption then I read this book. We're just starting the process and I consider this book absolutely essential. The 'Ukraine and Kasakstan' part is a 20 page summary of differences."
4,Excellent resource.,Very comprehensive and exceptionally well-written. I also like his way of organizing the material. A worthwhile read for anyone who is looking for an interpretation of the subject matter.
1,Very Disappointing,"I do not believe i have read a book written in a worse manner. Firstly, there are constant references to Jung and depth psychology, as if either had any importance to the history of gnosticism, and this detracts very much from the readability of the book. Secondly, the author makes almost as many references to ideas shared between gnosticism and ""esoteric"" spirituality without expounding on them, leaving the reader confused about some of the more troublesome beliefs of gnosticism. thirdly, the writing is almost intolerably lax (a chapter subtitled ""will the real gnostic please stand up?"" comes to mind), and the author seems to make assumptions about the level of familiarity of the reader with gnosticism. fourthly, and perhaps most importantly, it feels as though there is very little information about historical gnosticism.for another review that i felt was honest, though a bit harsh, see the other one star review."
1,Not recommended,"This book was painful to read, full of psychological and metaphysical mumbo jumbo. About all the lay person can expect to get out of this book is that the author worships the likes of Carl Jung. There must be a better first book on Gnosticism."
2,It doesn't flow,I don't understand what it is that so many people like about this book. My three boys did not enjoy it at all. This book does not flow. Sometimes it seems to try to copy the style of Dr. Seuss without success and at other times it seems to be trying to go in its own direction. Rhyming words help children learn to recognise similarities in words. Often the words almost rhyme in this book (spot and what). The author is jumping through different styles of poetry throughout this book.
5,Mama I wanna read Mr Carp!,"Almost every nite we read ""Mr. Carp"" as my son calls it. Such a sweet story. I don't even mind reading it 700 times. I take it on vacation too. You'll love it."
3,A fish out of water,I like this book because its about a fish and a fish is one of my favorite animals because of how colorful they can be. I also like this book because it describes events in the story so well. This book is adventurous. It makes me want to have an adventure just like this one.Alyssa Seifferly
1,Just Plain Dumb,This book is just plain idiotic. It teaches nothing. In fact it probably does harm by confusing kids with its stupidity.
4,Looking For Awhile,"I was looking for this book for about 2 yrs and I finally found it here, now I can read it to my heart's content!!"
5,wish for more,"Hope the writer will decide to write some more for this series, will sure try the other novels! Sad it was the last .."
5,One of the All Time Greats,"Anita O'day is one of my all time favorite singers and I feel lucky that I was able to buy a Japanese import of ""At Mister Kelly's,"" because it is one of her best albums.The albums of Anita O'Day are either Big Band or Small Jazz Ensembles, and I prefer the the latter because it brings out her voice more. This album with a jazz trio is half upbeat and half ballads. The ballads are good but the upbeat tunes are my favorites. Every song is good. ""But Not For Me,"" ""Star Eyes,"" and ""Tea For Two"" are my favorites.""At Mister Kelly's"" might seem expensive because it is a Japanese import, but the quality of the music makes it priceless."
4,Pentax DCF WP II 10x42 Binocular,"These binoculars so far have performed great. I did have to return one pair due to a defect, but this pair seems to be fine. The view is great, the image is clear and for the money you can't go wrong."
1,Not written for adults,"I agree with the other reviewer that said this book is written for young adults. The writing style is so basic and not interesting, and there is very little romance in this book. I understand that this is a Christian romance so there won't be anything about the physical side of things, and that is fine because I enjoy reading Christian romance, but this was more like a bible study than a novel. If you are looking for a good Christian romance I suggest looking in to any of Lori Wick's books."
4,A Nice Getaway!,This book was a nice getaway for me. I was able to live inside the story and enjoy the good times and feel sadness for the bad things that happened. It was a story that I could not tell ahead of time how it would end. I feel that it was very well written even though it moved around a good bit to the different characters. I felt like I actually knew the characters by the length of time used to introduce them. Definitely entertaining. I will be reading more from these authors....
1,Baseball Dad,To the point:Excellent and easy to use...accurate.Very cheaply made. Fell apart in two days. Bought it from the lacross ball store. I had to pay the shipping back. Basically cost me money to use for two days. Bad device. Better read your return policies.BD
5,History of American Culture in Song - WONDERFUL,"A classic 3 cd collection of American music ranging from all the patriotic standards to union organizing songs, protest songs from the Vietnam era and many more classics, all performed by outstanding performers. And it's a wonderful, diverse group of world class performers including Duke Ellington ( National Anthem) , Willien Nelson ( Amazing Grace) Leonard Bernstein and the NY Philharmonic, Peter Paul and Mary, Mahalia Jackson, Gene Autry . The list goes on and on. The best of the best.This is a wonderful famliy gift for the holidays or 4'th of July or most any occasion.Highly Recommended"
1,Without a single redeeming quality.,"There is little here that you can't find better described and illustrated in other more worth books on Photoshop. Most of the techniques are adequately described in Photoshop's own online help manual.For example, Davis spends two pages describing color calibration for Windows machines. Her material is literally a lift of the Photoshop help file and fails to point out the crucial importance of truly accurate color calibration.This is typical of the book as a whole: instruction without explanation.A waste of money in my opinion. Anyone interested in increasing their Photoshop skills should spend considerable time either reading reviews of other books on the subject or thumbing through other tomes at the library or local bookstore.Jerry"
5,Finding meaning in suffering,"Rarely does a book capture the ways that a family can find purpose and forgiveness in the face of cruelty from others. This detailed account of the imprisonment of the father and eventual banishment of the entire family to a rural village in China puts a face on the experiences of educated persons during Mao's rule. In the same tradition as Viktor Frankl's book, Man's Search for Meaning, the author's descriptions and reflections show the resilience and depth of the human spirit. This book is extremely informative about the Maoist regime and inspiring about the strength of persons to survive and thrive in the harshest of circumstances. One of the best books I've ever read."
2,Would have been 1 star without Anne Collins,Skip it. It falls on its own flat feet. Get the brilliant Douglas/Olsen/Warlow Australian Opera production instead. It's a live on-stage performance and hysterically perfect!
3,"Not the best version of ""Patience""","We did ""Patience"" about thirty years ago at UConn, set in a lovely monochromatic design concept, which resembled a Blue Willow china pattern. The production was chock full of references to Oscar Wilde, Coventry Patmore, et alia. It was very campy and very well done. This video seems somewhat ho-hum in that Judith DePaul HAD to video the COMPLEAT G+S for the project in the UK in the Eighties. I get the feeling that the producers just said, about ""Patience"", we ""we have to do it."" It is too bad. ""Patience"", in many ways, is Gilbert's most brilliant libretto. Sullivan is not as his best here, but the score is certainly very good. I do agree with another reviewer here in that the work is far more topical than ""Mikado"" or ""Pirates"". But for anyone who knows the Aesthetic movement of the 1880s in London will howl at this very funny opera.(Stratford Canada...PLEASE do this show! Your other G+S shows on DVD are brilliant!!!)"
3,Alot more material still out there,"I was one of the lucky that bought the BBC sampler 3 years before the final release. Unfortunately, litigation on the part of Bowie prevented the many discs worth of Spiders from Mars era material from being released. Sadly, we're left with 1 disc out of 4 or 5 that the BBC originally promised.The live disc is a treat."
5,I only bought it for the bonus album (well worth it),"I must admit that I bought this collection solely for the third ""bonus"" album. Having seen the live performance on BBC America, I instantly knew that I had to have this recording. The songs sound much fuller and more developed than they appear on many of his albums, particularly I'm Afraid of Americans, which is far superior to the form which appears on Earthling. This collection isn't quite as edgy, but is considerably more easy to listen to."
3,the glitter era was best in both music and theatrics.,"CD two is best; full of good renditons of the ""Ziggy Stardust-Hunky Dory"" material. the velvet underground songs are rocking. Just CD 2 is worth the price. The first CD is good at the beggining(tracks 1 to 5 ""derum collection"") and towards the end (""width of a circle"" and the songs from the first mentioned albums tracts 14 to 17), but in the middle it slows and becomes dull(cuts 6 to 8, 10 to 13). The MC's patter adds to the sense of being on the BBC. Third CD is acceptable in a old rocker sort of way. ""Stay"" is best on this level and ""absolute beginners"" is alright. If anyone knows of the band (Ranold, Rhino, Rano?) Mr. peel mentions on the fist CD, as Bowie working with, drop me a line."
3,must have for bowie fans,"if you're a fan of david bowie, you'll want this. some of it, particularly the first six tracks of the first disc, is nice to have for its historical import more so than for its musical content. however, most of what's here represents a lot of bowie's better work. it's also a huge amount of music in terms of length (unlike many of bowie's albums!). as a bowie fan, i'm very pleased with the album; i only gave three stars because those of you who are not big bowie fans might want to look elsewhere first."
3,Back to the future,"I buy the CD only for the 3e disk. The first disk sounds not good, the second disk better most songs are on lp ore cd the bonus disk Live sounds perfect, its was better two cd's live and one to the BeeB."
3,Historical Sessions (Plus One),"Bowie at the BEEB, a two-disc set of historical sessions called from BBC Sessions between 1968-1972 (with a limited edition third disc of a June 2000 show), is the document of a minor artist blooming into a major one. Disc One, mostly early material circa Space Oddity, is badly recorded, with Bowie in tentative voice (or, worse, his proto-Newley mode). Disc Two, the Hunky Dory / Ziggy Stardust years, is a gem - the material strong, Bowie confident, rakish. Best in show, though, is the Limited Edition June 27, 2000 disc. His latest band is probably the best he's ever worked with, the new material is strong live, and the catalogue material is reworked into wonderful new arrangements. Even a warhorse as tired as ""Let's Dance"" sounds fresh in this company. In fact, for the first two minutes, I couldn't even figure out what song it was!"
1,useless,"After 9-12 months use it started beeping and displayed ""err"". There's no explanation of what to do. Not worth pursuing---just threw it away---I would stay away from this product."
1,Eats batteries,The 'beep' others report is because is wants a new battery -- and a battery usually lasts less than a year.
4,Excellent reference for VoIP,"This book is very compact, concise and contains a wealth of information that I could not find in any other single reference. It provides a very good introduction to voice technologies for the data engineer and more specific information about the voice capabilities of Cisco routers (although there is no coverage of 800, 1750 or MC3810) with numerous example configurations.Contents, 1.Intro, 2. Packetized Voice Overview, 3. Voice Concepts for Data engineers, 4. QoS for IP, 5.Qos for Frame Relay, 6. Understanding Voice Ports and Dial Peers, 7. Developing a Dial Plan, 8. Integrating It All, 9. Sample Configurations, 10. VoIP Case Study, Appendix. Webliography.The only disappointment is that the book is very IP-centric, VoFR is from an IP over Frame perspective and VoATM gets no coverage. The book is barely over 300 pages, so I don't think this would have been asking too much."
3,"Packed with info, but poorly written","I'd have rated this book much lower if it wasn't cram packed full of great information. The problem is, the writing style makes it impossible to read this book from cover to cover if you don't already know everything in it. If ever an IT book was screaming for a glossary, this was the one. The author habitually uses terms and acronyms as if the reader already knew them, and then goes on to define them chapters later. At least on one occassion, I found a term used in chapter 2 defined in chapter 3. The definition of the term used another that wasn't defined until chapter 5. As said, there's no glossary, and the index is entirely too sparse to cover for that omission. Reading this book WILL teach you well, but don't sit down with it without a reference library and/or net connection handy to look up the terms that you can't find any other way."
4,Really pickin' on the Dead,"While I enjoyed the Pickin' On offerings, this one is more satifying. Vassar provides authenticity and the young folks in the band provide some solid picking and vocals. I'd suggest this one strongly for any fan of acoustic music deadhead or not."
2,Vassar Clements ~ Dead Grass,After a couple of listens it is OK. I've heard better Dead covers +better Vassar Clements but then I've also heard much worse Dead coverattempts. The female vocalist was definitely out of her element.
3,Not bad for not really being QR,"Much like the final QR album, this one had little to do with the band it its true form.The vocals were good, just not anything like DuBrow.Joker was fun, rest of the songs were formulaic 80s metal. Nothing truly impressive.All in all, average sounding metal band, but NOT true Quiet Riot."
4,Nice watch,"Purchased this watch for my wife. She said the only thing that she would have changed is to make the date a little larger. She has problems reading it without her reading glasses.So far, it is keeping accurate time.The watch face is a pretty blue, and the hands are easy to read.The manual that came with it was for a Seiko diving watch, which didn't have any information on adjusting the bracelet."
2,Not real happy with this watch,"This watch, being automatic must be worn in order to continue keeping the time, day and date. It often changes day and date on the 12:00PM hour rather then the AM hour. It is nice looking however."
4,Image/Video quality,"Taking phote is good outdoor, but poor indoor. Somewhat worse than average 5MB compact camera.Video is ok both outdoor and indoor. Clearly worse than average Mini DV camcorder."
3,Does the job,"This camera does the job fairly well, but is far below the Cannon SD1000 and Elph 300 HS. I gave it away to a friend as a favor, but only because she did not have a camera at all. YAK"
2,Very poor camera,"I read the reviews and thought I'd still give it a try.After one battery charge, I was ""lucky"" enough to have a defective unit - the camera wouldn't start again after the first charge.My observations from that first short use were:- Quality of pictures was very poor (my Pentax Optio 4mp camera takes better quality photos) -- very disapointing for a 6mp camera.- The flash was generally useless, and actually hurt quality- The camera was very uncomforable if you don't have very small hands. My wrist hurt after using it for 20 minutes.- The video was ok, but the focus was very slow (and noisy).- I had the same problem as several others -- that the camera died shortly afer getting it (shows very poor quality).All-in-all don't waste your money. You can get a much better camera at a lower price."
2,Not worth the price.,"Pictures quality is mediocre.Night video is terrible.Stills for night shots, again unacceptable.Never should supplement this for a regular camcorder.If you are into small gadget high tech toy camcorder, buy yourself an Apteck MPVR. Takes pretty good shots, same size as this, and costs just $200.Save the difference and invest in a decent camcorder like, perhaps, a Canon Optura 600 or similar. There are plenty of great camcorders in quality and size in the sub-compact camera category.Also,in my opinion, the new Sanyo Xacti suffers from the same problem of poor quality night shots.There is certainly a compromise in quality when you move to mpeg 4 compression."
5,Sanyo Xacti VPC-C6,"Delivery of camera was very prompt. Camera was what I expected, I am very pleased with it's portability, and usefulness. Sanyo support of the VPC-C6 camera is great with Sanyo Firmware Update Downloads. Thanks!"
1,So not original,"Well now I have seen everything. I see that crass commercialism has gotten on the chill out bandwagon. Now that the people behind ""Totally Hits"" has put out their own chill out compilation, all I need is for the ""Now! That is What I Call Music"" folks to release their own compilation of downtempo music. Most of the songs on this album are a couple of years old and/or have already been put on every single...chill out/new age cd there is known to mankind. This is disgusting. I would rather spend my money on imports where the song selection is a lot better. Heck! Even the ""Utra Chilled"" series is a lot better than this wasted piece of plastic. I guess it is fine for the mainstream audience who wants to jump on the chill out bandwagon but for diehard fans of downtempo music, this is a must avoid!!!!!!"

It is currently advertised for $49.95 on the website with $7.95 S&H; to my hometown in Paris, IL."
3,Parts break easily,"Although this food processor is great when it works, many of the parts are subject to frequent breaking and are very costly to replace. I have replaced the stem three times in ten years or so. I have replaced the bowl once, and one of the blades has broken twice. The motor has held up fine despite all the parts breaking along the way. I have given up paying premium prices to replace parts. I am looking for an alternative which will offer me as large a bowl as this."
3,GMRS good or bad???,I like this radio.Good points are1. tough antena2. came with nimh batteries3. Good range through trees4. earbud5. very easy to open up the squelch and keep it open with having to keep pushing a buttionBad points are1. Belt clip is easly broken2.VOX dose not work with the earbud3. When scanning the radio dose not show the sub coad of the radios it picks up.4. can not connect a exturnal antena5. No lanyard loopIf you get a deal on one of thease go for it. Other wize go for one of the new 2 watt mortorla radios. Or get a midland G11. I can't say I would buy them again but they are overall good radios.
4,A well thoughtout Approach,"Clear, not too thick and well presented. This is a book that a student will not find difficult to deal with.This book gives some brief strategies and then good test questions.If you want just a strategy book this is not it."
2,these guys are the hispanic B2K... its terrible!!!!,why are artist trying to be like other artist>? it does not make any sense what so ever.... especially in this kind of music.... it seems that they are trying to be something they are not... there is not originality in any genre of music...they do sound good so that is why i gave them 2 stars... they would sound better if they did reggaeton than this tejano pop crap....please it anyone reads this.... be original... that is the reason why music is going downhill...
4,"Good, but not great","Andre changes his style from the previous albums. His beats are more high strung instead of the deep bass you here in his other albums. If you want to hear the best of Andre, check him out when he was Dre Dog, when he came out with I Hate You With A Passion. You can listen to the whole album through and most of his hits are on it. The Daiquiri Factory is still good cause it is still Andre, but his beats and lyrics are very different from the other albums."
3,Good enough.,"It was good enough. I will say that other more expensive models are available, and if you want better quality then get a more expensive one. You get what you pay for. This serves it's purpose and has some nice features. The sound quality on the handset isn't the best, but it'll do."
4,Lesser known Art Garfunkel,"This is a good, but obscure, part of Art Garfunkel's works on Columbia. Bought the CD for 'I Wonder Why'. Several tunes are melodic and good to listen to, especially if you are a Garfunkel fan."
3,Lefty Lovers,"Even though this album wasn't a big seller, its still a great album. The songs that were the best to me were the ones that have the word ""LOVE"" in them: ""I Have A Love"", ""So Much In Love"", ""Love Is The Only Chain"", ""When A Man Loves A Woman"", and ""If Love Takes You Away"". Of all the other songs, ""This Is The Moment"" was the best one to me. In my opinion, love ballads are the best songs that Artie sings, whether the albums are successful, or non-successful. Just about all recording artists go through a cycle like that. Artie is still a romantic, sounding singer."
3,It is lovely....But is Arts weakest,"Of all of Art Garfunkels albums, I find this to be the weakest.That is NOT to say it is bad, however. Each song has it's own charm.I Wonder Why, When A Man Loves A Woman and If Love Takes You Away are my favourites.King of Tonga is probably the most bizarre Garfunkel song I have ever heard, although it is capturing somehow.The other songs all have their strong points, although they don't feel as epic as his best work, and they seem somewhat lost on this album.Overall, Lefty doesn't quite reach Garfunkels usual standards, and I would not recommended this as the first Garfunkel CD to buy, that is Angel Clare, his first solo album."
5,Good Investment,"This review is for the Asian set. As a DIYer I consider tools like this an investment. This set is cheaper than buying individual adapters. After purchasing a Stant adapter that did not fit on its proported application, I ordered this set. The listed adapter worked like it was supposed to. I also like the fact that its made in America. Since very few of us keep vehicles until they die of old age, having multiple adapters extends the usefulness of the set. It also comes in handy when your friends want you to test their cars. I will be buying the European set next."
2,Disappointing,"Not enough information was given on the review about the product. Didn't realize that it really wasn't a game, but an enhancer. I, howeverdid resell it on Amazon."
3,It's Fine,"This is a fine product if you are looking for a device to transfer saved xbox games from pc to console.I am having a hard time with it, trying to find game saves on Gamesharks website.I originally bought this to transfer a saved game from DOAX Beach Volley Ball, but I can not find a game save anywhere.Also the device is not that easy to use, it should work like a usb zip drive but it doesn't.It is hard to write to and extract files from.I would only recommend this product to individuals that are xbox console savvy."
4,Works Like A Charm,"I got this to software mod my xbox, and it worked great. It only works with gameshark/microsoft brand memory cards, so I had to get another one. Plus, the lack of a driver auto-installer was sorely missed. I thought it wasn't working till I rummaged through the system files on the disk and found the drivers. But in the end it worked, so I'm happy."
2,too much filler/ a 2cd coaster,"first of all, let me say that this is not a soundtrack. it is a promotional gimmic. none of these songs are featured in the film. there is too much filler garbage. if you need a new soundtrack look elsewhere."
2,What a rip off!!,"I gave this two stars because I love Kool & the Gang's music. It deserves only one star for having only 5 videos. Why not release their VHS tape, Decade, on DVD? It had all the great videos including the long version of Misled. And as for live performances, Live at the House of Blues doesn't include JT Taylor so they need to release the VHS, Tonight, on DVD. That is one of their best live performances. Give the fans what they really want and not this DVD with only 5 videos on it."
1,Complete waste of time and money,"Why would anybody release a DVD video collection with such a small numver of videos??? Anybody interested in buying this would be willing to pay a bit more for a COMPLETE video collection. This is just a ridiculous waste of time and money. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. Send a message that we want COMPLETE collections on DVD and not this lame disc. It's obvious that whoever envisioned the ""20th Century Masters"" DVD series has no interest in pleasing fans and just wants to cash in."
2,not happy with this icecream maker,"My suggestion is that if you want to try this machine, go ahead and take your chances. Maybe your luck will be better than mine. I suggest buying from a local vendor with a liberal return policy. And, by all means, make sure you keep the receipt.I bought this unit based on the positive reviews on this site. I don't question the experience of those who gave it a positive review. Unfortunately, I was not as lucky fortunate. The first unit had a defective on/off switch, and would not turn on. We exchanged it for another unit. This one turned on, but the parts wouldn't seat properly. I thought I had solved the problem, but later discovered that the freezer bowl was canted and rubbing against the interior of the clear plastic cover, scattering plastic shavings everywhere. I had to discard the ice cream (since I wasn't sure how far the plastic shavings had spread out).and return the second unit. I will be looking for an ice cream maker from some other company."
1,Horrible Maker,"This thing took forever to make anything; if you want to make something in a moments notice you must keep the rotating bowl in the freezer at all times. The bowl takes over 7 hours to freeze and be ready to use. After that, it only takes 15-20 mins for it to thaw out all the way and need another 7 hour freezing. Just plain awful. The only thing i made in it that turned out o.k. was Sorbet and Sherbert."
5,Great Ice Cream,Makes great ice cream 30 mins and your done. Use heavy cream and hole milk for high quality ice cream. Good or better than Breyers
5,Very happy,I've had this ice cream maker for about a year and use it at least once a month. I have never had a problem with it and have been very pleased with the results. The output is not as creamy as Ben & Jerry's but I guess I can't expect miracles! My only complaint is I need a second bowl since my husband and I like different flavors--I don't like having to wait up to a full day to make a second batch. I do recommend the Ben & Jerry's recipt booklet. The raspberry sorbet and ice cream and the peach ice cream are phenomenal!
4,"I've only used it once, so far,",but it worked very well. I made half a batch of peppermint stick ice cream for the maiden voyage and I think it is delicious. (It is ripening in the freezer right now.) It did have a thin layer around the walls that seemed to be completely separate from the main blob of ice cream but I just let that thaw a little and used a spatula to mix it in with the rest of the ice cream when I put it in a bowl for the freezer. The recipe said 25-30 minutes of mixing but at 25 minutes it was frozen solid and it was too late to get the peppermint pieces mixed in by the machine. I will add mix-ins at about 20 minutes next time. It is not terribly noisy but you will know when it is running.This unit was a refurbished machine and the motor seems to work well but the base of the unit was dirty. I was surprised and disappointed that they didn't bother to clean it before passing it along to its next owner.
3,"Noisy, but worked well for 8 batches ...","Concept works well, frozen bowl, motor to stir and it worked well for about 8 batches of ice cream and frozen slushes until the motor burned up. Very noisy and weak motor that didn't last long earn it a 3 at best."
1,I'm giving up after 4 years,"I have been trying this ice cream maker regularly for 4 years. I returned one and got a replacement, but I am not getting better results. 1 in 5 times it produces nice ice cream. But 4 out of 5 times the ice cream never thickens. I leave the freezer bowl in the freezer all the time and pay outrageous electical bills just to make sure the freezer really is at 0 degrees. I thought I would look at the new model, thinking it would correct the errors in this machine, but after seeing that the cost is 6 times this one and the reviews not a lot better, doesn't sound like a good trade."
5,A great ice cream maker,"I picked this one up intriged with the design, where the freezer bowl is turned around the scraper blades instead of vice-versa. My previous ice cream maker had died because the motor couldn't handle the effort of turning the blades in the bowl as the ice cream got more and more solid.It turns out the simple change in design makes a huge difference. My old ice cream maker had difficulty from the beginning but this model has continuously worked well.The only possible complaint is that this machine is on the loud side. It is much less loud than my old machine but still enough to make conversation a little more challenging."
4,We all scream for ice cream,"This machine works great PROVIDED you make very sure the bowl is solidly frozen. Any liquid sound and you're going to get a liguid product. I made the mistake of trying the first time using an elaborate frozen yogurt recipe where you drain the yogurt, etc. Way too much trouble. The recipes in the book are simpler. Also, my first ice cream I used all half and half for the cream and milk. It was not as creamy as commercial ice cream but certainly lower fat.My machine also came with a second bowl, which is essential I think. I felt that I got a smoking deal since and extra bowl costs $30, and paid less than that for the machine and 2 bowls at Costco."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"Love this Ice-Cream Maker!! It's as easy as the other reviewers say it is... I mix some half & half, milk, a box of instant pudding and VOILA! it's ice cream!! Chocolate, banana cream, cheesecake...Be sure to thoroughly freeze the container. I bought an extra one, so i could make enough for everybody, and I'm glad I did! I keep them both in the freezer, so that if I feel the urge, I can have ice cream in around 30 min.Just don't overfill.. anything more than 3c of liquid and it overflows.LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!"
4,IT'S PRETTY GOOD!,"This counter-top ice-cream maker works pretty well. It works best if you make sure that the bowl is 100% frozen solid, which means leaving it in the freezer at least overnight. Also once you've made your mix, put that in the freezer too for a little while so it's very cold. I also add the mix to the bowl and then the paddle and then the lid, because if you try to pour it in thru the hole in the lid, like the directions say, you end up with a mess all over the counter.Another thing I've learned is don't even attempt to make the 'kids' ice cream recipe in the book, the one that uses instant pudding mix. This just makes cement. You can't eat it and it practically ruined the bowl! I had to soak it in boiling water and scrape it off with a metal scraper! What a disaster!The easiest, creamiest ice cream recipe is just to use 2 cups heavy cream 1 cup half and half, 3/4 cup fine ground sugar and 2 tbsps of real vanilla extract. Easy. Creamy. Yummy. Enjoy!!"
5,Great Ice Cream Maker,"I bought this machine along with ""The Ultimate Ice Cream Book"" by Bruce Weinstein, and have successfully made at least 10 recipes from the book. I can't add anything to the positive reviews already written, except for the fact that I accidentally dropped the bowl from the freezer onto the kitchen tile floor. It survived the 5-foot fall and suffered no dents, cracks or scratches, and has continued to work flawlessly."
5,Ice Cream the way you want it.,"I just used this product to make chocolate ice cream. I followed the instructions and realize I will probably never buy ice cream again. I can make my own ice cream as rich or as bland as I want. The only drawback is making the space in your freezer for the ice cream can. I left it in there for four days before making the ice cream and if I had more of the same recipie, I could have made a second quart of chocolate because the can stayed frozen for over an hour. I recommend it to all ice cream lovers."
5,Phenomenal ice cream!,"I bought this little machine after seeing it on Oprah. This is absolutely the EASIEST kitchen tool to use and it produces FABULOUS ice cream! I followed Alton Brown's suggestion to heat the cream, milk and sugar over the stove to simmering, then to cool it all day in the fridge. I then got the urge to put a chopped up mango in there. I just poured it all into the frozen bowl, flipped the switch, and 20 minutes later I had incredible mango ice cream. This is going to be my #1 Christmas gift this year (#2 is the George Foreman grill with removeable plates, but that's another review)."
5,"Bought for a gift, awesome ice cream",I have a Maverick Ice Cream shoppe and the Cuisinart. I just picked up this model for a fathers day gift from Costco for $23. I should have bought 2. all of them make great ice cream. just make sure your bowl is completely frozen and all ingredients are well chilled. I have even made ice cream with 1/2 cup of rum in it. Some recipes call for 2c of cream to 1c of milk. I find that buch fat gets waxy on the roof of my mouth. so I lean towards more half heavy whipping cream and half whole milk.
5,Love it!!!,I am so happy and in luv with my ice cream maker !! Now I dont pay up to $6.00 for ice cream when I can make as much as I want . The key to this is to keep everything COLD and when making the ice cream over the top with a dish choth. You will be amazed by how easy it is too use .
3,Not exactly instant gratification,"When I got this machine, I put the bowl in my freezer and after 6 hours tried to make some ice cream even though the bowl was not completely frozen.If you read all the other reviews here, you know that it doesnt work that way.You need to freeze this bowl for a very long time before you make your first batch. Like 24 hours or more.Other than that, the machine is great, easy to use and easy to clean."
4,Excellent ice-cream maker,"This ice cream maker is excellent because it makes ... excellent ice creams. Easy to clean, the 2 little drawbacks are: a bit noisy and I would have a preferred a larger bowl. But I do not regret my purchase. The vanilla ice cream recipe that comes with the ice maker is simply outstanding!!"
2,"milk-based products OK, but doesn't work for sorbet","I bought this from a local retailer since it was the only one in stock, and was so disappointed I returned it. It made sherbet (milk-based) with no problem at all, but I've really been craving sorbet, and the freezer bucket simply wasn't cold enough to do the job--it chilled my mix, but didn't even turn it to slush before it had warmed... at which point I had no choice but to put the bucket back in the freezer for another 9 hours, only to repeat the cycle several times before giving up."
1,What a piece of garbage,"A surprise from Cuisinart. It arrived at my house, and was quite excited to use it. About 10 minutes after turning it blew a circut and the motor was fried. Now it no longer works. My recommendation is seek another solution."
3,A Must Have for Ice Cream Enthusiasts,This Ice Cream maker is an absolutely MUST HAVE for ANY Ice Cream enthusiast!
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought mine at bed, bath & beyond for $ 40.00. This is the best ice cream I have ever tasted.The ice cream comes out soft serve, but if you will freeze for a few hours it comes out hard just like store bought.My kids love the lemon sorbets. I would buy this product again & again."
1,Weak Machine,"Maybe I got a lemon, but this machine is weak! It shut itself off ofter seven minutes due to over-heating (I'm assuming??) and didn't function again until the next morning! What good is an ice-cream maker that doesn't have enough power to churn the recipes included and recommended by the manufacturer? I have your answer...no good...I'm returning mine...and would advise against purchasing one...especially from an internet company where it costs you money in shipping to return a defective machine..."
5,Fabulous Ice Cream Maker,"I bought this ice cream maker for my son, who is a chef. We also bought the extra bowl and recipe book. He was so very happy with the gift. Also he was excited that we bought an extra bowl. Since his birthday, he has been experimenting with the different recipes.We told him he better have a good recipe for Thanksgiving as we are all looking forward to some ice cream."
3,Ice cream maker,Ice cream maker. I was exactly what I wanted for the kids. I works fantasticly and is a cinch to clean!
1,Ice cream is soup,"I've rarely had such a highly rated item fail me, but I've tried this thing a half dozen times over the last few months and finally have to give it the worst review I've ever given anything. It has simply never created anything resembling ice cream. I actually like soft ice cream, but this is just soup. And, yes, the bowl has been very frozen in the back of the freezer for weeks on end, but it does no good. And yes, I've tried different recipes. The only upside is that I've eaten very little ice cream over the last 6 months. I'm going to go get an old-fashioned bucket style maker with rock salt..."
5,Very nice machine,I just recieved this ice cream maker and couldn't be happier.I am very pleased with it.
5,"Fun for All, Great Ice Cream Maker","I actually have the red one, It looks pretty nice. Imagine the fun you can have with your family without having to worry about salt or turning a crank. This is really a nice product. The ice cream after twenty minutes taste great. The consitancy is a little harder than soft serve. However, if you have time to stick the finished product in the freezer for a few hours the consitancy is great. I have made both the simple and the more involved vanilla. Both are great. Can't wait to try more recipies. I have to admit I love gadgets and this one is fun for all with a great tasting result. I got mine in a deal at william sonamo which gave me the second bowl for free. I suggest if you buy one you consider purchasing the second bowl."
4,"Overall great - noisy, small capacity","Overall I really like this ice cream maker, it is fast and effective and as long as you can just keep the bowl in your freezer all the time then you're always ready to go. It is noisy so don't plan any important phone calls or discussions for the 20 minutes it's running. I also find I would like a slightly larger capacity (or maybe I just eat too much ice cream). But in general makes it easy and convenient to make all sorts of tasty frozen treats at home."
4,"To soon to tell, but ...","I chilled the bowl for over 24 hours as stated in the instructions and made an excellent strawberry sorbet on my first attempt. Preparing all of the ingredients was the hard part: once they were blended and chilled, I just poured them into the machine and let it churn for about 25 minutes. As others have noted, the unit IS really loud. I had to put it in another room (away from the kitchen) while it ran as it's as loud as a blender. Other than that, so far so good!"
1,A piece of junk,"A piece of junk. The motor died after only a couple of minutes of operation--the first time we used it!! We called Cuisinart Customer Service immediately, and were extremely frustrated by the poor service and excuses for the defective merchandise we received. Save yourself the frustration and buy some good ice cream at the grocery store."
1,wish I did my research first,"This product was very dissapointing for several reasons.1. you can only fill it half way full for it to function properly. (which I found out the hard way)2. you must cover the hole at the top to stay cold and actually freeze.3. it does come with an extra bowl, which is nice, but it takes up TONS of room in the freezer4. you must use the bowl right out of the freezer.. if you wait even 3 minutes it is a complete failureright after i made my first batch and failed, I searched how to make my own ice cream with out a ice cream maker and found that if you use whole cream, and whip it, then add the sugar, egg yolk and vanilla, and then softly mix in any chunks (oreos or whatever) and then put it in a covered dish, it will freeze, scoop easliy, and last for weeks. Sure wish I had looked for that first.make this first and then see if you need a ice cream maker:3 egg yolks3 cups heavy cream1/2-3/4 cup sugar or maple syrup1 TBL organic vanilla extract"
2,unnecessarily noisy,"This machine works. The suffering from having to hear it, the dissatisfaction with the end result has put me off making my own ice cream. I just don't see ice cream as a part of my family's diet to the extent that owning this machine is warranted."
5,Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker,"I purchased the Cuisinart one and a half quart ice cream maker for my grandson for his eighth birthday. He enjoys cooking, and he loves to make different things for his family to eat. I was hopeful that the Cuisinart ice cream maker would be a gift he would enjoy, and I hoped it wouldn't be too difficult for him to use. He, along with his family, have made ice cream several times since I gave it to him. They have all commented on how tasty the ice cream is - even as far as saying, it's the best ice cream they've ever had!"
4,Nice unit,Everything worked as expected and as the manufacturer stated. This unit makes it very easy to have home-made ice cream in 20 minutes. I am very pleased with the product.
4,Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker,Have used it to make sherbert. The sherbert was perfect as long as the bowl was cold enough. We found that keeping it in the freezer for at least 24 hours before making sherbert works best. 8 to 12 hours in the freezer turned out barely slushy sherbert. The bowl is small enough so that it doesn't take up too much space. We store the bowl in the freezer (in a large plastic storage bag) so that it is always ready for use.
4,good and quick,I bought this to replace a cheaper table top ice cream maker and was very satisfied with it's preformance. I found that it freezes well if you put ice cubes in a bag in it. I made mocha chip ice cream and it was great.
2,Not Vegan Friendly,"I got this for X-mas in 2002. By mid-January 2003, I had stopped using it completely. It does not stay cold enough for long enough to make vegan, soy or non-dairy ice cream. I'm a professional baker and have never had a product fail like this one did. I haven't read many reviews for this, but it's a huge waste of space in my kitchen."
4,Simple and a Great Product!,Great product! Worth buying. Awesome price...it's the previous model but small has all the same features of the current model but it's less expensive. Makes great ice cream in smaller portions. Very few steps to follow! Should have purchased sooner!
5,Great Product,"This is the perfect ice cream maker. Easy to use, easy to clean and easy to store. It makes great ice cream every time. My husband is on a special diet where he can't eat sugar, and was so sad to give up ice cream. With this machine, I make him fabulous ice cream using Agave syrup as a substitute for sugar, and the resulting ice cream is as good as any I have had. It doesn't make huge quantities, just about a quart at a time, but it literally takes 10 minutes to prepare everything, and 1/2 hour working on its own to turn it into ice cream. Then maximum five minutes clean up time. Also the price can't be beat for this quality."
2,disappointed,"I bought this based upon the reviews. Wish I hadn't. This makes mush. I have tried all the tricks, receipes, and suggestions - still mush. With the exception of the VERY HARD mess stuck to the side of the bowl which is impossible to remove. It is ok for making smoothies..but icecream??? No. Messy. Easier to use my blender for smoothies."
1,Very Disappointed with this Cuisinart Product and I own more than one!,Tried to use it on three separate instances and the product never fully froze. I would not recommend this product to anyone!
4,Does what it says,This is a pretty cool ice cream maker. Does what it says.. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the noise level when it is running.
5,"makes great ice cream, etc",Having lots of fun and adventures making great ice cream. My hubby loves the mocha recipe in the booklet that comes with the machine. I am getting one for each of my grown children for their anniversaries.Love it.
1,Not what I expected with a 4 Star rating...,"I read the reviews and then I bought this machine. It certainly wasn't what I thought I would get. The paddle doesn't scrape the sides during the freezing process and it ends up leaving more than an entire serving frozen to the sides while the rest of the ice cream rotates in the center and never quite gets to the frozen consistency. Once the majority of the contents gets frozen it has a hard time churning and the stuff stuck to the sides gets colder while the center portion doesn't. What a waste!!! And dont even try and pry the stuff off the sides, it wont come off until it thaws or you rinse it down the drain."
4,Easy recipe for organic dark chocolate ice milk,"We have used this machine frequently. Just start it up after dinner, and by the time we've cleaned up, dessert is ready. We put our ice cream dishes in the freezer before starting because it melts quickly. We like the following: Mix 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch processed for maximum antioxidants) with 1/4 to 1/3 cup organic sugar. Add a little organic milk (sometimes we use nonfat, sometimes whole milk) and stir to a thick paste. Then stir in about 2 1/2 cups of milk gradually. A little Kahlua is a very nice addition. Pour into the machine and press start. The machine is noisy, so we set it up in a room that has a door that closes."
3,"Nice idea, but the design could use some improvement.","I bought the maker and an extra bowl for a present. Second time it was used, the bowl slipped and broke open. They should redesign that bowl. Some sort of rim to hold or rings to grip it with would be great. Also, a lid for the bowl would be an easy addition and very useful. Finally, They save a little by making the outside of the bowl plastic, but it also makes it very easy to break open and spill out the coolant. The machine itself works like a charm. Not that noisy as someone mentioned, as long as you don't have to be in the same room with it for the whole time. :)"
1,No No No!,"The sides and bottom of the freezer bowl build up with a THICK layer of inedible over-frozen ice cream that has to be chisled off. Meanwhile, the ice cream in the center of the bowl never even develops to the soft serve stage! AAARGH! Maybe it's a quality contol issue with the one I bought, since obviously not everyone who bought one has had this experience. However, mine is going to the landfill, where it belongs."
1,"Noisy, small and never cold enough","This is the worst Cuisinart product ever. So loud that I cannot hear anything in the same room. What comes out is a cold mushy mess- not a solid ice cream or even a softer sorbet. Even the mushy mess takes at least double the time suggested. It says 1.5 quarts, but if you put 1 quart in, it overflows over the sides. I keep the cold bowl in my deep freeze at all times, so I know that it is frozen enough, but it still does not work. We have tried to use it multiple times, for both ice cream and sorbet, and it is always a bummer. You are better off sticking a smoothy in the freezer than trying to use this machine. Very disappointed with this product. Throwing it away, and buying something else. What a waste of money."
4,"Maquina de hacer helados, interesante","Si funciona y esteticamente no esta mal. Ya hicimos una prueba y salieron bien los helados, pero si es necesario dejarlos un rato en el congelador para que tomen textura o se endurezcan."
3,"Easy to use and clean, very noisy","This ice cream maker seems well-designed, is easy to clean, compact, has a cord storage compartment in back, and it works as described. It makes about 1 quart though, not 1 1/2. More than a quart of unfrozen liquid will expand beyond the capacity during the freezing process and overflow, making a big mess. The motor is also very noisy, so much so I thought there was something really wrong with it the first time we used it, but because it works fine, we think it's just a noisy appliance. The noise level increases as the mixture thickens during freezing so it's probably normal. I wouldn't use it if anyone in the house were trying to sleep!"
5,Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker,"Recommended by a friend; it's everything she said it would be. Simple and quick to use. I found that the container freezes extremely well after several hours, though other reviews said to leave it in for 2 days. I found it not necessary. Don't know if it's due to my freezer - I have a SubZero. Recipes are excellent. Extremely satisfied with the product and highly recommend it."
5,love it!,"Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice-Cream Maker, WhiteReceived ice cream maker very quickly. Easy to use, clean and take care of. Works like a charm!"
4,excellent product,"i have used this almost every other day since i purchased it, works wonderfull. easy to care for."
1,Cold vanilla soup...,Was so excited to receive my ice cream maker. Froze the bowl for 2 1/2 days and chilled the custard overnight. The mixture never thickened up or froze at all. What a waste of money and cream.
3,Good for the price...,"If you want to make ice cream often or in large batches, spring for one of the fancier machines. If it's a once in a while thing, then this one is probably just fine. I find I have the most success if I make a small batch and fill the canister no more than half way. Also, I bought an extra canister - if I want to make a big batch, I usually have to switch canisters halfway through as they thaw out pretty fast."
5,Worth the great reviews!,"Made the most luscious vanilla ice cream I've ever had in 25 minutes. Did some figuring and it turns out that we made 2 pints of ice cream for less than it costs to buy a pint in the grocery store. It's compact, stores well in my cupboard, fast, easy to clean, and will be getting lots of use in my kitchen."
5,Great Ice Cream,"Fun and easy to use. As others have stated it does require you to freeze the bowl for 2 days to get a nice freeze while making the ice cream. Sometimes it will come out a little soupy. Make sure you are using alcohol free vanilla and you will get better results. All in all it's different from store bought ice cream, but still tasty and a fun things to create together with the family."
2,Has stopped freezing,"Well I've used this icecream maker (Cuisinart) for a total of 5 times and all of a sudden no kind of icecream is freezing any longer. I tried vanilla with PURE vanilla extract, and hazelnut with a specialty hazelnut flavoring made especially in Italy for their icecream parlors. Anyone have any ideas? Is my bowl just done?"
5,Makes Great Ice Cream!,"I bought this for my husband who is an ice cream junkie! We have both made ice cream the old fashioned way and the Cuisinart is so easy! We keep the bowl in the freezer ready to go! The bowl does need to freeze at least overnight. We run the ice cream maker for 30 min. It makes a nice soft serve ice cream, if you want it firmer put it in a container the freezer. The unit cleans up easily. I give this 5 stars!"
3,The ice cream maker makes clunky noises and doesn't always work correctly,"The cream seems to freeze the the sides really quickly, which makes the top do this crazy clunky noise that seems.... wrong. Plus the ice cream doesn't always turn out perfect. Which could be a user error.... So keep that in mind!"
4,Follow directions carefully,this worked perfect the first three times. then it started not working and i realized because it is not forgiving. you must follow all instructions carefully. you must make sure the custard mixture is thick enough and that it is cooled properly and that the freezer bowl is properly frozen. it makes great ice cream when you follow the instructions carefully.
2,Hard Around the Bowl,"I really wanted to love this ice cream maker. I was Somersizing and wanted to use the all natural ice cream mixes that went along with the diet. I could get my ice cream to freeze- that wasn't a problem. It was like wonderful soft serve in the middle of the bowl. However, all along the edges of the bowl it was frozen rock solid and NOTHING was going to remove the ice cream from around it. The ring of rock hard ice cream wasn't just a small skim, it was a substantial amount. Sadly, this has spent more time hidden in the depths of my cabinets than being used."
5,Great Ice cream Maker,"I brought this Item last week, and my husband and we love it. One little trick I use is I make the mix and freeze it a few hours and then when we make ice cream its made in about 10min. The ice cream is easy to make and the very best we have ever tasted. No more store brought ice cream for us and are in our late 50s. Ice cream just like when you were a kid. We are having a ball with this and our friends are enjoying it to."
2,Does not Freeze Properly,"I received my ice cream maker about a week ago. No matter how long the bowl is put in the freezer (over 24 hours)(There is no problem with the freezer, as it freezes ice, meat, etc. just fine), it does not get cold enough to make ice cream thick enough. Even when the ingredients are put in the freezer to begin freezing before putting in the ice cream bowl, it does not get solid enough, but stays very soupy with just a few ice crystals throughout. Would not buy it again!"
5,Good value for the money,"It's easy to use, easy to clean. So far every batch of cream I have made has flopped, but that was my fault, not the machine's. The machine works; the operator is another story."
2,A disappointment...,"I tried many times to make ice cream with this thing, and every time it just wouldn't freeze enough. I would try keeping it going, hoping it would freeze, and it never worked. I would then put it in the freezer to continue the freeze, and it always, ALWAYS resulted in ice crystals (which led to grainy, non-smooth ice cream). I was so excited when I bought this, bought all sorts of cream and mix-ins, and the Ben & Jerry's recipe book. The ice cream was the complete opposite of the smooth ice cream Ben & Jerry's makes."
5,Great Idea!,"I saw the use of a similar (bigger more costly) machine on an episode of Martha Stewart. After researching, I decided from reviews to order this ice cream maker. We love it!!!!! So far we have been only making sorbet, but I've bought ingredients to expand it's use. I plan on giving 3 more of these are wedding, birthday and Christmas gifts in the next few months.We keep the bowl in the freezer and chill the mixture before we put in the machine. We have made some incredible strawberry sorbet several times. Easy to use, clean and is not very loud at all.Anyone who hates fooling with ice and rock salt will love this ice cream maker!!!!"
5,Wonderful Ice Cream,"This is just the right size for my husband and I when we entertain friends. It is easy to use, and easy to clean. One tip that I recommend - Put your sugar in the freezer. Your Ice Cream will turn out harder, and faster, than if you start with your sugar at room temperature. ENJOY!!"
1,Check the return policy and keep your receipt,"I bought this unit based on the positive reviews on this site. I don't question the experience of those who gave it a positive review. Unfortunately, I was not as fortunate.The first unit had a defective on/off switch, and would not turn on. We exchanged it for another unit. This one turned on, but the parts wouldn't seat properly. I thought I had solved the problem, but later discovered that the freezer bowl was canted and rubbing against the interior of the clear plastic cover, scattering plastic shavings everywhere. I had to discard the ice cream (since I wasn't sure how far the plastic shavings had dispersed) and return the second unit. I will be looking for an ice cream maker from some other company.If you want to try this machine, go ahead and take your chances. Maybe your luck will be better than mine. I suggest buying from a local vendor with a liberal return policy. And, by all means, make sure you keep the receipt."
3,Wish it worked better.,"I love my Cuisinart Frozen Yogurt Maker. So much so, that I have purchased two. And now, neither of them work. They make a great product: just don't fill the bowl too full. When you do (and it is easy to do), the ingredients run down the sides, into the motor, and the whole thing quits.Now I know this is my fault for not following the recipes...so, enjoy the ice cream and watch your measurements!"
3,Worked fine until....,"This product was great until the bowl cracked. It made wonderful ice creams/sorbets, but after about 8-10 batches, the bowl cracked and the stuff inside leaked out. What a mess! Was able to save the sorbet, but had a big clean up to do! A friend said the same thing happened to her, twice!! And another friend said it happened to her too. Not sure what to recommend."
1,Noisy!,"The biggest problem is the noise. And the hassle. There's pre-prep required, then noise for 30- minutes (so you can't make it while you're in the kitchen), then freezing again for a couple hours.... Lot of time, noise and cleaning up. At that price, I'll buy my ice-cream! Or pay for a model that is at least a bit quieter."
2,Doesn't work for me,"I've gotten good ice cream from it twice, and I've gotten stirred slush about ten times. I've actually learned how to make my own ice cream from the slush by freezing and stirring on a schedule. Save your money."
1,What a frustrating device,"I thought this would be a great idea, but I was wrong.The original bowl had been in the freezer for 3 days and it didn't freeze, while everything else in there is rock hard.I called Customer Service and a replacement was promptly sent. This one has been in the freezer for two days now and it isn't frozen either."
2,Don't EVER fudge a recipe or it may overflow and seize up next time you use it,"Surely I am not the only messy ice cream chef. I tossed in a few extra berries and as the mix froze, it slopped over the bowl a bit. It must have leaked into and gummed up the motor because now it won't turn at all even though there is power. What a stupid design. I for sure would not have been able to let my kids use this, as the same thing would have happened, and what fun is making ice cream if the kids can't help?"
3,crapped out after 2 years,"I bought this in August 2010 and used it frequently until last week (April 2012) when it died. I think that some of the melted ice cream liquid spilled over the top and drained down from the frozen container section onto the base and into the motor compartment. My daughter was using it and had overfilled the container. This is my best guess. But it's possible that the motor just went kaput.When I buy another one, and I will - because even though it died, it is a very easy way to make ice cream -- when I buy another one, I will look for one that has a few different features. This model allowed a significant amount of ice cream to be frozen to the inside wall of the freezer container and would not scoop out. I'd have to wait until it thawed to get the frozen ice cream off the inside container wall. Also, it was tricky to pour the ice cream mixture through the top and I'd like a better way to fill the freezer container. And last, I wish it had a larger capacity."
2,What was I thinking?,"Who actually buys an ice cream maker?I used this once since I purchased it, with the results mediocre at best, and haven't used it since. If the results were what I expected from home-made ice cream, maybe I would've used it more instead of going to a local ice cream stand or buying Ben + Jerry's at the supermaket. If you want quality ice cream, don't buy this machine."
1,Not happy with a dirty machine!,The Cuisinart ice cream machine had particles of food on the bottom of the machine. The cord also had a dirty brown spot on it which maybe food! The seams of the machine have brown in them which comes out using a knife in a cloth! This is the first used item ordered; I will not order again!
4,Fun to experiment with,"The bowl must be completely frozen before you can start. It takes a good 3 days for my bowl to freeze completely. There is prep work required for most recipes (blender, cooking, cooling) before you can add the mix to the ice cream maker. So you have to plan ahead a little, especially for recipes calling for cooked eggs. A blender is another handy tool to have if you're doing anything with fruit.I'm made a few recipes using soy milk and yogurt and are lactose in tolerant worthy, like a mock Cherry Garcia or Strawberry-Rhubard Frozen Yogurt. (If you're LI, you should be able to have yogurt due to the acidophilus content.)I think it's a fun appliance to have around and experiment with different recipes. Quite handy when you have a bounty of summer fruit on your hands. Make a frozen yogurt, sherbet or sorbet!"
5,Outstanding results!!!,I'm amazed at how easy it is to use this ice cream maker... no fuss. Just freeze the bowl for a couple of days in advance (or sometimes even overnight!). End result is always excellent! I love this product and would recommend it to all first time buyers.
4,Great Noisy ice-cream maker,"This was by far the best ice cream we have had in years. It's was great because you control the ingredients, flavor and consistency of the ice cream. Even thought the ice cream was great, the big drawback is the noise; this machine doesn't allow you to here the TV, the telephone or anything else within a 20/30 feet radius. I got out of the kitchen because I couldn't stand the noise; its louder than the blender or the juicer and the Cuisinart has to run for a lot longer. I called the Cuisinart customer service and it took me 5 attempts to get anybody a life. I was in hold betwen 7 and 23 minutes then the machine disconected me; I left messages on the customer service dept. but nobody ever called me back; when I finally got somebody they were short and told me they did not make quieter or silent ice cream makers. So get ready for that noisy Cuisinart."
1,Cuisinart ICE-20 need help w instru/comes out like soup,I hope someone can help me. My brand new ice cream maker--perhaps I am doing something wrong. Chiling time of 20-25 mins-seems to be too long. Put it in the freezer for 3 hrs--still soupy!!!Any suggestions/comments are welcomed.Thank you.
5,A Dream Come True!,"Best ice cream I've ever tasted--so good I want to share the news.I am buying my third one for a soon to be bride--as the second one was, this will be the best gift at the shower.It's so easy the groom will be able to use it too! Also a perfect gift for a bachelor!Buy one now!"
2,Not so impressed,"This made ice cream fast, but not impressed with the recipe or how the ice cream froze on the sides of the bowl while making it. It was so hard it was the impossible to get out of the bowl. I'm going to try again but seriously thinking of sending it back."
3,"Makes great ice cream, but motor has problems","While I love the ice cream this machine makes, the motor has a lot of problems. On only its second use, the motor hummed and wouldn't start for several minutes. It did this consistently over the next year but would start up after 5 or 10 minutes. However, now the motor just stops halfway through the process because it's overheating too quickly. Maybe I just got a lemon, but this is a pretty poor motor."
1,Not good if you want to make ice cream for 2,"This works if you fill it up with ingredients but doesn't if you want to make ice cream for 1 or 2 people. The ice cram sticks to the middle, doesn't touch the frozen sides and never hardens!!! Aweful. I had a cheap one from CVS that worked very well for many years (when it broke I decided to buy the Cuisinart one... Big mistake!)"
1,defective machine?,"First of all, we did not even get an instruction manual to work this thing. Then, after we downloaded it, I followed every instruction. The machine never made ice cream. It just made cold mix. I am not sure if we got a defective machine, but we are not willing to get another one."
2,Too much work,I bought a traditional icecream maker which uses ice and salt and although messy I got great icecream. I wanted an icecream maker that didn't need ice and salt and purchased the Cuisinart ICE-20. It was a huge mistake. This machine has a bowl that needs to be kept in the freezer before it can be used. So for sure don't buy the machine and plan to use it the same day. I have tried 3 times to use it after having kept the bowl in the freezer (wrapped in plastic) for weeks at a time. The bowl warms up before the icecream thickens into the icecream texture. Each time I have to freeze the icecream mixture first let it thaw a little bit and then use it in the machine. What a pain!! I think I'm going to go back to the ice and salt method or buy a machine that works better than the cuisinart. Anyone have any recommendations???
1,"If you want junk, buy this Cuisinart ice cream ""maker""","If you want a frustrating failed experience trying to make ice cream, buy this ICE-20. The most critical part, the paddle, is made of pure junk plastic. It is as strong as an ice cream stick and breaks just as easily.Cuisinart has no business marketing such inferior trash to the public.They have sullied their reputation with the ICE-20."
4,Ice cream maker,"Completely pleased with the product. Very simple to operate and maintain. Instructions are clearly written. Accompanying recipes are limited, but adequate for novice ice cream makers. Only drawback is capacity, about 5 cups. However, processing time is so short that multiple batches can be made for a crowd. Makes great olive oil ice cream."
4,"If you love ice cream, you really should get one of these","The Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker really is a toy. There. I said it. You combine the ingredients in a bowl and pour them into the Maker which stirs and freezes. Can you make ice cream without a Maker like this? Yes. But why would you want to?I keep my bowl in the freezer all the time and take it out when my ice cream muse hits me with a new concoction or an old favorite. I mix everything up and pour it in and my work is done.There are many ice cream flavors in the freezer section at your local grocer, but this is complete freedom. Make what you want and if it doesn't taste good, try something different next time.The ideal situation would have the ice cream ready to be eaten after its time in the Maker, but that isn't the case. So you have to either anticipate your cravings by about 24 hours or learn to keep some on hand at all times!"
5,Wonderful Ice Cream,"I love this machine! We keep the core in the freezer so we can have ice cream within 30 minutes at any time. The directions get you going and you can use your imagination from there. Sugar free, no problem. Fresh strawberries, great! Frozen yogurt, yummy."
5,Great Product,"This is a great product. Well worth the money. The enclosed recipes are great as well. If i had to give it a downfall, it would be the size of the container. It makes more than enough for 2, but if you want to feed 4 or more people, then you may want to consider the model up. WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!"
5,Great toy!,"I will not rehash what everyone else has said, but this ice cream maker is everything I could ask for. It makes ice cream and other frozen treats super fast, is easy to clean, compact, and not too loud. Sure, it's not whisper quiet, but I didn't think the noise level was unbearable and conversation is easy to hear over it. Cuisinart appliances have always seemed to be reliable so let's hope this one is no exception."
5,Works Great!,"I had my heart set on the Kitchenaid ice cream attachment for my stand mixer, but the price just seemed ridiculous for a bowl! I had been dying to make my own organic ice cream flavors and when I saw this machine at this price I couldn't pass it up. I've got to say that it works great, and makes a suitable amount at a time. In fact, because of the low price, I may go ahead and get a spare bowl so I can make two consecutive batches. Well worth the price and very easy to use and clean!"
4,Cuisnart Ice Cream Maker,Loved this little addition to our kitchen...makes wonderful ice cream that everyone loves! Our only issue...it doesn't make enough! Makes only about 4 servings.
5,Getting Fat,I purchased the Cuisinart ICE-20R after researching several other bands. I am completely happy with this item. I have made ice cream for the family every Friday night since it arrived. The ice cream is the right consistency. The machine makes a little noise when you are using it. It is not any louder than my bread machine. I love my Cuisinart.
1,Not as I had hoped,"I bought this several years ago; I make primarily sugar-free ice cream which does freeze harder. The third time I used it, the motor cut out because the mixture got too hard. Once it cools down, it will start up again, but by that time it's too late. And even now, when I'm making sugar-full ice cream for the family, the motor dies after about 10 minutes of churning. So now I'm fairly unhappy with the Cuisinart brand and am hesitant to get the upgrade."
5,Great Little Machine,"I've had this ice cream maker for a few years now and think it's great. If you freeze the mixing bowl for at least 24 hours and stick to a recipe, you should be just fine. Now that I have two young boys, I'm making a lot more ice cream than I used to. My kids love the whole process. They help me pick out the recipe, measure the ingredients, mix `em up, pour `em in, and watch it churn. It's easier than you may think. And clean-up is a snap. Highly recommended."
4,I love my frozen yogurt maker!,"This is a nice frozen yogurt maker for a reasonable price. I have used it 4x in two weeks, 3x for frozen yogurt and once for ice cream. I bought it as a way to make lower cal and lower fat treats, and I love it. It only makes about a quart (4 cups), which is perfect for a small family. It is very easy to use."
2,Sometimes it works,I too am having issues w/ the vanilla ice cream freezing in the bowl. The first time I used the machine it worked great. I can freeze sorbet's which I mainly use this machine. But for guests I have tried to make different types of ice cream. But the vanilla will not freeze. I thought maybe it had to do with the alcohol in the vanilla extract but then I tried the imitation w/ no alcohol but still won't freeze. I still have the box so maybe I will take it back. But it does make great sorbets.
4,Makes Great Ice Cream for the Price,"I purchased the Cuisnart after seeing it in a local store. When I saw the free extra freezer bowl - I ordered it here. We had an old Rival maker that used ice and salt and was so noisy we had to set it up outside. While this unit is not totally silent, it is a great improvement over the old Rival. I absolutely love it for our low-carb treats and the kids love to make their slushies. We have a large chest freezer to keep our bowls in, but I could see someone with limited freezer space having a storage problem. I think it's a great product for the price!"
5,"Fast, clean and easy",I have owned this maker for 2 years and have enjoyed being able to make sorbert or ice cream at my leisure without having to worry about having the ice or the salt. Its speedy also without any work on my part.
4,Shipped Fast with All Parts. Works Great!,"I received the product quickly and he did mention that the box was a little mangled. The product had all original packaging and manuals with an extra recipe book added. The only downside was that the product was a bit dirty upon receiving, but a quick clean and it was ready to run. I have tried it once so far and it worked great. Thanks!"
5,Make sure your freezer is COLD enough,This little machine works like a breeze. Well made and easy clean up. The biggest problem I have noticed is that relatively few people know how cold their freezer is (as well as their fridge). I bought a device to show me the temps and now i keep my freezer at 0F and my fridge at 34F-35F - and I have not had any problems keeping the bowl cold enough to freeze up the cream. So easy and fast - as well as fresh good ingredients have made possessing this machine a delight. I highly recommend it as well as recommending all of us periodically checking the temps in both our freezers and fridges.
5,LOVE IT!!!,"I have never written a review before on an item, but I just love this product so much, I had to submit this. For the price, this machine is a great value. Yes, you can buy self-containing machines, but they cost several hundred dollars. For $40, you can't beat the value. I received mine last week and have so far made lemon sorbet and vanilla ice cream (I did get the ""Ben and Jerry's"" recipe book, worth every penny! I used their recipe for the ice cream). It was so easy to use, and the sorbet and ice cream were fantastic. This is my new favorite appliance, and I can foresee using it a lot this summer. I love the fact that I can make homeade ice cream, sherbet, sorbets, etc., and I get to control the ingredients. And rather than buying slushies at the mall, just make your own out of cranberry juice, coke, etc-So many possibilities! I just wish I had gotten it sooner, but the good news is that summer is still early! :)"
1,why isn't plastic bag for preventing freezer burn provided,"My first reaction is very negative. If the bowl is to be stored in the freezer in a plastic bag, why doesn't the bowl come in such a bag??My old automatic freezer, pre 1999, came with a very heavy duty bag for such storage.Maybe a gallon ziplock will work???"
1,Loud and liquid,"This machine is loud. It is louder than my dishwasher. And my dishwasher is not a quiet one. You must chill the container prior to each use. So you can only make one quart-1/2 quarts a day. Not really enough if you have a family.Additionally, the resulting product is too soft and must be frozen after churned. We attempted to eat some immediately after churning, it melted faster than it could be eaten resulting in a bowl of cream.It was disappointing. After using this machine, which I have returned. I will be looking for a machine that uses ice and salt, the old fashioned way, the way that actually works."
1,Ice Cream maker,"I tried 4 times to make an ice cream, but it nerver solidify while going through the process. After one hour in this machine, it is still liquid {note - I placed the container in the freezer for 3 days before using}. Then I placed it in a pastic container & leave it in the freezer to harden. When I scoop it out the texture wasn't creamy at all.. like a popsicle with the fruit at the bottom and heavy cream on top. I am pretty good in baking & cooking. But this machine failed and will never recommend it to any consumer.Please let cuisinart be aware of this and forward this remarks over to them and ask them if they can reply to me.I am thinking of returning them back, but I threw away the mailing box.Sincerely,Got stuck (Eva)"
1,VENDOR SWITCH,"I bought this item from Amazon, realizing that another vendor would be the one shipping it. I paid 57.99 to the vendor. When I received the item it had a sale price tag of 49.99 from BED, BATH AND BEYOND (which is not the vendor involved.) I don't like getting second hand items. If I wanted to buy from Bed, Bath and Beyond, I would have gone to their website."
1,Complete failure no matter what recipe/temp I used,"How many ways must a person try this machine to actually get it to work? We're never trying another cuisinart ice cream maker.No matter how cold I got the liquid and how much I made sure the frozen bowl was at zero degrees (the way other users have advised), I got a ring of immoveable solid frozen liquid all the way around the edge of the bowl, and cold liquid in the middle - and the machine wouldn't do any more than that. I tried several recipes, same problems, nothing anywhere near ice cream. Gee how about some cold pudding with a chunk of hard-as-rock ice on the side?Could some of the reviews for this product be a bit overly optomistic?"
4,generally pleased,"This machine makes very good ice cream, but it is extremely loud, compared to other ice cream makers we've had. We put it in a separate room and close the door while it is processing."
2,Inconsistent results,"I just purchased this ice cream makers and had high expectations. I have been quite disappointed. Although I followed the instructions to the letter, the ice cream does not freeze adequately and comes out soupy. The first batch I put in the freezer and it managed to come out a reasonable (although not perfect) consitency after several hours. However, the second batch ended up quite freezer burned and I am now trying to figure out whether I can return it, as I am not at all inclined to make any more."
1,So Noisy!,"This ice cream machine makes me sad, only further complicating my relationship to the delightful treats that come out of it. Occasionally I take it out of the cupboard, only to hide it in my bedroom of my one bed apartment. Wrapping it in layers of towels, the machine can comfortably turn a wall away while I am not driven to the brink of insanity listening to a miniature lawnmower chug away not ten feet away from me.The bummer of this is that I don't mind Cuisinart as a brand overall. That's why I thought this was a good buy.... But for an extra ten or twenty dollars, a stronger, QUIETER ice cream maker would be the way to go.And I could get into design issues with the free-floating, plastic churning non-attachment, but why bother. Don't buy this. Spring for a model that will work without the racket."
2,Am I the only person who DOESN'T like this machine?,"Sorry, but the Cuisinart ice cream maker that I purchased just doesn't work! I'm so bummed about it because I gave it to my roommate as a gift - now it serves as a constant reminder of my failed present. Specifically, the ice cream just never freezes. I've tried changing the recipes (from those in the manual), new recipes...it truly just never freezes. The best I get is a milk shake. (And, yes, I completely freeze the bucket). Based on the reviews on this site, however, it sounds like I'm the only person who has experienced such issues."
2,be sure not to drop the bowl!,"The ice cream was good, but the freezing bowl droped about 1 inch on the floor and splattered this horrible chemical all over me and the floor. It ruined the floor and burned my skin. I was surprised at how easily the bowl shattered. They should make it higher quality."
4,Recreational Cook,"I have had great experience with this machine thus far. It works fast and is easy to clean. Be careful not to overfill the freezer bowl, or you will run into trouble."
1,Such a disappointment,"I received this as a gift and was thrilled. After all, it's a Cuisinart, so it has to be good, right? Wrong. It doesn't work at all. I've followed the directions in the manual and tried at least 15 different recipes, but each time the machine stops working within 10 minutes of turning it on. The edges freeze so hard that the motor can't keep running. I turn the machine off and wait, then on again, but to no avail. Not once have I produced ice cream with this machine. I like all of my other Cuisinart products, but I'll never recommend their ice cream maker to anyone."
4,Satisfactory,"I just bought this Ice Cream maker, and I muyst admit it has performed up to my expectations. It churns the ice cream until it's soft serve consistency (I knew it would turn out that way) and then I pop it in the freezer for an hour or two and it's ready. I bought the Ben & Jerry Ice Cream Book along with it, and have made two batches which have both been excellent so far. I'm now experimenting wth my own flavors (i.e. Hazelnut, etc.). A good investment though not as good as an actual commercial ice cream maker."
2,Cusinart - Soft Yogurt,"This machine seemed pretty easy to use. I followed the instructions and tried to make frozen strawberry yogurt. We chilled the bowl for 16 hours, made a very cold preparation of yogurt, frozen berries, and milk (per Cusinart's recipe booklet). At the end of the cycle, we ended up with a very runny strawberry mess. We put this into the freezer and after 2 hours it was still soft in the middle of the container.Also, this ice cream maker is Made in China and seemed very flimsy to me! I have since returned this item and don't feel that it was worth the money."
4,I like the machine,"So far I like the machine. Of course, it is raining here now and I risk being called crazy by making ice cream, but I have used it four times with success. I expect to make ice cream many times during the summer months."
5,Very Nice and Easy,"Easy to use, easy to clean, and works great for the price. The recipe book has some great ideas. I would recommend it to others."
5,I love this machine!,"I got one for my birthday last year and this is probably our favorite specialty appliance. We have used it over and over, and my favorite thing about it is that you can make flavors that you can't find in the store - I love Chocolate Cookies-n-Cream and you can't get that anymore. One mistake I think a lot of people make with this is the bowl - it needs to freeze overnight (put it in the back of your freezer) and don't remove it until you are ready to pour the mix in the machine. The bowl defrosts quickly and if you take it out and let it sit while you prepare your mix, it won't work. We have a 2nd bowl and keep both in the freezer in bags at all times just so it's ready to go when we want to. I also have the Ben & Jerry's recipe book and the Light Chocolate with Peanut Butter is INCREDIBLE. I don't use eggs, don't want to worry about getting sick and haven't noticed a difference without them. I highly recommend this product to anyone, it's great fun!!!!"
5,Wonderful Machine!,"What Donvier started, Cuisinart perfected! There are a lot of great features to this machine. I like the 1.5 quart capacity, because most recipes that say they're 1 quart are actually more when frozen, so I rarely have leftover mix.The opening in the top makes it easy to start the freezing process without having the dasher stick to the can. It's also great for last-minute additions, which I do a lot because I generally add a bit of vodka at the end to keep my ice cream from getting too hard.I purchased an extra bowl and it's come in handy many, many times. Sometimes you don't want 1.5 quarts of the same flavor, so I'll make the custard base and turn it into two different flavors of ice cream and I can freeze them one after the other. The extra bowl also helps if I'm in a hurry and don't want to totally chill the mix. Then I chill it almost to the freezing point in one and move it to the second one. Buy an extra bowl!!"
5,easy to use,this product is so easy to use to create many different types of ice creams and iced drinks. the included recipe book is also nice to get those creative ideas flowing for any type of ice cream creation! easy clean up as well.
5,Quick and easy to use,"I received this for my bridal shower. I tried it to make sure it worked before I lost the gift receipt. It is so easy to use. I made up a batch of ingredients to make vanilla frozen yogurt. It was quick and easy to assemble. I poured the liquid in and off it went for 20-25 minutes. It was louder then I anticipated, but nothing crazy. It froze perfectly and tasted wonderful. I am looking forward to making more delicious ice creams, sorbets, sherbets, frozen yogurts, and even frozen slushy drinks. This thing is awesome. It seems pretty darn solid and it easy to clean."
4,Like it,I like the Cuisinart ICE-20 Ice Cream Maker. The recipes have been good and the machine is working out well. The only issue I have is the paddle gets a little off line and I have to use a tool to keep it level at the start.
5,"What can I say, Ice cream so easy to make, ready in a flash","The basic recipes are so easy. I have all the ingredients on hand except heavy cream. This is what I make for dessert when company comes. It always gets raves. It so easy it's fun. I am still working on finding the perfect yogurt ice cream. I like to experiment. One word for the wiser, don't add any extras like chips or nuts until the last five minutes! I didn't read the instructions clearly and threw them in with the mix. The chips froze to the sides and I had to stop and clean it all out! Oh well, live and learn."
5,Yuuuummmmyyyy!,This ice cream maker is great. I made the fresh strawberry flavor first and it turned out delicious. The machine is very easy to use and clean-up is simple. I bought this ice cream maker on the recommendation of a cooking site and I'm not disappointed.
5,Makes delicious ice cream!,"This machine is great! It is easy to use and the directions are very straight forward. My husband has made several ice creams in this machine and they all turned out great! The bowl was completely frozen in our freezer in about 6 hours. It does say it may take a lot loger but it hasn't for us. I don't think our freezer is particularly cold either. When we made ice cream with mix-in, it was very easy to do with this machine. It is also very easy to clean which is important to us. I think this will be a staple in our house for years to come. The only caveat is it is a little noisy but that may be par for the course with these types of machines."
1,Unless you have a super freezer....,"I've had the freezing bowl in the freezer at home for 3 straight days and the liquid inside is still ""liquid"".I then put it inside another freezer elsewhere where the door isn't opened so often as in the one I have at home. Voila! It worked, usually in less than 24 hours (freezing time recommended by instruction manual) it was ready for use.One time I was preparing an important dinner for guests and I had my ice cream base ready but the bowls (which had been placed to freeze 2 days before) were still liquid inside. Lucky for me, there was an ice cream place nearby and I asked them to prepare my ice cream in their machine. They saved me.So bottom line is, unless your freezer door is not opened frequently, the freezer bowl will be ready in a wiz, otherwise, prepare to wait at least a few days before you can make your ice cream."
1,"I'd give it 0 stars, if possible","Bought this ice cream maker at Macy's. Froze the bowl, as directed, and added the ingredients from one of the included recipes, but it never solidified past liquid slop with a few ice crystals. Very disappointing. I'm returning it to buy a REAL ice cream maker that uses ice and salt."
2,regret buying this,I wish we had not bought this ice cream maker. We have never made any ice cream that is that good and it is just something else to take up space in my kitchen. In today's world with a million different ice creams available at the stores there is no need to buy an ice cream maker.
1,Overcharged for shipping and no response!!!,"I have enjoyed purchasing from Amazon in the past but this time, something must have gone wrong and I am very disappointed that there has not been a response from Amazon. I was charged over $37 for standard shipping which displayed to be less than $10 on the site. I recommend not to purchase this product unless you don't mind returning it if you are charged nearly the price of the product for shipping!Or find another vendor to purchase this ice maker."
2,Good News and Bad News,"Good News and Bad News on this purchase.Bad News - Did not live up to my expectations.Good News - Was easy to return and account was credited immediately.Thank you, Amazon.com."
1,Not for real ice cream,"I bought this model at Frye's last 4th of July. I thought it would work well because it was a Cuisinart. At first I thought I was not following the recipes right, then I thought it was the recipes, finally I just gave up and got Frye's to give me a credit on it (10 months later)."
5,Very pleased with this purchase,"Very easy to use, easy to clean. No salt or ice needed. Made fabulous ""ice cream"" from soy milk. You could make a frozen treat in about 20 minutes with almost any ingredients. As vegan/raw foodists, we have been stuck, but with this machine we can once again enjoy a creamy frozen treat. Use your imagination to concoct treats, or try the recipe book Vice Cream by Jeff Rodgers. This book is great for vegans, but honestly anyone would enjoy the recipes in it."
2,Worked well in the beginning,"I enjoyed this machine for several months and it is ok for the money. ... couldn't wait to use it. It was great after I got over the initial, ""bowl wouldn't freeze until two days late"" problem. After we figured out that it needed to be in the Freezer longer then they stated on the manual, we kept making ice cream.Some of the problems we have came after about two months time. The ice cream will freeze to the inside of the bowl about 1/4"" thick. The scraper is plastic and is not very durable and has stopped doing the job of scraping the ice cream off the sides.The only way now is to sit over the ice cream maker with a plastic spoon and scrape the walls myself. Sometimes the ice cream will get stuck and not move at all.This is all by following the instructions on the manual, or following instructions from Ice Cream recipe books.I am still using it, but to me, it's not as good as I would have liked it to be."
1,Cuisinart ICE-20 1 1/2-Quart Automatic Ice Cream Maker,"I purchased this item approximately 2 years ago. It is a nice size and design; however, all I ever get out of it is SLOP. The container never seems to get cold enough to make a even a semi-solid product. This is not due to lack of sufficient time in the freezer because I keep the container low in a deep freezer. I have followed several of the recipes from the recipe book included in the box with NO SUCCESS. It always ends up going to the cats. Therefore, I definitely advise not wasting your time and money on this item.I have several other kitchen appliances made by Cuisinart that I have been extremely satisfied with, but this purchase did not hold up to my previous high expectations of Cuisinart."
1,The motor died the fourth time I used it,"The ICE-20 worked as advertised for the first 3 timesit was used. Follow directions to the ""T"" making sure youhave chilled ingredients, you can make great ice creamand frozen yogurt.However, it died the fourth time I tried to used it.The motor gave up the will and I lost my receipt...Probably will try a different brand next time."
3,A Little Disappointing,"Our first couple of tries with this ice cream maker did not yield stunning results. The first batch, just plain vanilla, never got creamy. It remained liquid the entire time in the machine (we had to break out the old reliable Oster ice cream maker, with salt, to save the mixture from being thrown out). We had left the bowl in the freezer for two days and left the mixture in the refrigerator for a day. The only other thing I can think of for the next time would be to put the mixture in the freezer and take it out just before it freezes. The machine is very well made and uses quality components."
3,helpful tip,"The large opening in the top is great to check the progress and put extra ingredients in, but it is a huge source of cold loss. I tried placing a folded clean kitchen towel over the opening, and it greatly increased the speed of the freezing and the quality of the final product. If I leave off the towel, it never really gets solid. Give it a try!"
5,It's Wonderful!!!,"I love my Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker! It is easy to use, and it works wonderfully every time! And the recipes that come along with it are very good, too! I also have the book, ""Gelato!: Italian Ice Cream, Sorbetti & Granite""; it has wonderful recipes as well! I have perfect results every time! I highly recommend this Ice Cream Maker!"
5,What a treat!,"I've used my new appliance for ice cream and frozen yogurt, both of which were a huge hit. I was amazed at how fast and easy the whole process was and will certainly be using this machine a lot. The frozen yogurt was the best I've ever had and one of my granddaughters actually said she liked it even more than the ice cream!"
5,Smooth and Creamy Ice Cream,Love this appliance. It is simple and easy to operate. I bought it specifically to make 'raw' ice cream. The ice cream comes out beautifully in less than an hour. I have a vitamix blender and was concerned when reading other's reviews about the noise level... from my perspective (having a loud appliance that I use a minimum of 2x a day) this ice cream maker is practically noise-free! Some hints for using:1) Make sure the bowl is frozen solid. We keep our stored in the freezer so it is always ready to go2) Go for at least 45 minutes for a more 'ice cream' consistency... you can even go a little longer if needed. At 30 minutes it is more like a soft-serve consistency (also good)3) If you can chill your ingredients first it's even betterWhat a great way to get a healthy (depending on the ingredients you choose) treat!
3,Ice cream too expensive to make,"This machine does make good ice cream, but it is too expensive to make ice cream. It is cheaper to buy a higher quality brand ice cream than make yourself, especially if the brand name is on sale. Cost me about $5.00 to make a 1 1/2 quarts. Dreyers or Breyers can be bought on sale for about $3.00. Just not worth it."
1,Not what expected - never freezes,"Bad bad bad1) The bowl never get freezed, even with my refrigerator in max power.2) The base is very noisy (around 90 dB)3) It's imposible to do an ice cream on it.The worst item from cuisinart.(note that here in Colombia this item costs around 300 US Dollars)(in stores only)"
3,Neither impressed or disappointed,"I did use this quite a bit over the summer but not so much when it got cold outside. There are not a ton of recipes for it and hard to find online. It doesn't freeze the ice cream very much so we have been putting ours in freezer for couple of hours before eating. I bought it with credit card rewards so I am not completely disappointed. But it didn't turn out to be everything I had hoped for. I am afraid I am bored with it already after just 3 months.You also have to be very careful not to overfill it. The recipes in the book seem to be too much to fit. I also felt that there was not enough variety in the cookbook. Too many repeats. Basically just chocolate, strawberry and vanilla."
3,I wish I wish...,It would be nice if they told you that you have to freeze some big metal container to make ice cream. Otherwise I would probably have bought one that was self cooling. But it works well if you don't mind putting that thing in the freezer.
1,Soft in the center/Frozen hard on the outside,"Once icecream is frozen enough you can't remove all of it from the bowl because it ""sticks"" to sides. Your not supposed to scrape it as it can damage the interior of the bowl. Fourty minutes later the 1/4"" of ice is still frozen hard to edges.Would not buy again."
2,Dasher Broke After 20 Uses,"Once I got the hang of it (there is a bit of a learning curve, but it's not terribly steep), I loved the frozen treats that I could make - especially frozen yogurt.A few weeks ago, while it was mid way thru churning, the upper, cylindrical part of the dasher snapped away from the vertical, scraping arm. Because the machine is out of warranty, I had to order the part's replacement at my own expense. While it's not going to break the bank, Cuisinart informed me that it would take 8 weeks (!) to fill my order.I'd considered ordering the dasher that was introduced in the newer model, since it's supposed to be more efficient, but I wasn't sure that it would fit in the ICE-20.Bottom Line: Great concept, lousy parts."
2,"Good product, bad price","Works very well--but [at the price]? Come on! This unit isvirtually identical to the Deni ice cream maker I bought at Target for[little over half the price]this spring--which also works very well. Shop around, people!"
5,Fantastic Product,"After years of wanting and looking, trying the hand cranks and ice, I've found the perfect machine. So simple to use. Almost doesn't need a manual.The most fantastic ice creams in minutes. Just make sure the empty bowl is stored in the freezer, and ingredients are cold. (for lighter, creamier ice cream, I lightly beat the cream before adding to any receipe.)Easy to experiment with. All our friends look forward to my ice cream."
2,Plastic parts are NOT dishwasher safe!,"I purchased the CIM-22PC (a similar model) from Costco. Be aware that key plastic parts (the lid and mixing arm) are not dishwasher safe. In our case, they warped in the dishwasher and rendered the entire machine unusable. Cuisinart should have used dishwasher-safe plastic."
3,Cuisinart IceCream Review,"Within a half hour you can have yummy tasting icecream, the only thing is it is very loud when it is churning. So if you are searching for a silent ice cream machine, I wouldn't suggest this one, otherwise having an electric machine beats churning the ice cream on your own,"
1,Great ice cream until it breaks,This ice cream maker stopped working after about six uses for no apparent reason. Buyer beware.
3,Gets the job done until the paddle breaks,"This is an ok design, and it gets the job done. So I wouldn't complain if it weren't for how cheap the paddle is. It fell from my toddler's hands (short distance) and part of it broke off. It feels cheaply made, very thin. I would think this part would be a little sturdier, being that it's supposed to stir thick ice cream. From the day we bought this machine, it felt like it could possibly break toward the end of a thick batch. I'm buying one replacement paddle and if that one breaks, too, we're done with this machine.If I could improve this item, I'd make it quieter (the motor is so loud, you cannot hold a conversation in the same room while it's going without yelling.) I'd also improve the starburst-shaped hole in the top - it's such an odd shape and relatively small size that you can't pour the ice cream batter in without spilling some on it, and it's very awkward to clean. And a sturdier paddle, of course."
2,I like my old Rival better,"I have the white one, which I've had for two years now. This machine is convenient, easy, and it's not as loud as my old Rival which requires ice and salt, but that's where the pros end. For one, this thing only makes 1.5 quarts at most! Because it freezes so quickly, the texture of the ice cream isn't nearly as creamy as my old Rival's ice cream. When ice cream freezes too fast you get ice crystals, so the texture is icy rather than creamy. Also, because the bucket is itself frozen, you get nearly a cup of your ice cream frozen solid against the sides of the bucket and you can't get it off until the bucket thaws. So, by the time you get to scoop out your homemade ice cream all you get is a little over one quart of icy ice cream, since the rest is frozen against the sides of the bucket, and that's a LOT of work for that little amount of ice cream. I want my old, noisy Rival back!"
4,"Great, with limitations","Replacement purchase, since our original unit is starting to make a bit more noise. The original is still working, but we've used it frequently for several years and decided to get a low cost spare (plus it gives us a second bowl). The key to successful use of the Cuisinart is to not expect too much cooling capability. We keep the freezer pretty cold, make sure the mix is refrigerated before use and we don't try absolutely full batches. That said, we get reliable sorbet out of the Cuisinart. A neat idea for acidic or strawberry mixes (courtesy of America's Test Kitchen I think) is to add a shot of vodka to the mix, which helps keep the result smooth vs granular after storage in the freezer."
1,Something must be wrong with the machine,"I followed the directions to a T. However, it didn't seem to work. I tried making two batches. It was disappointing since I was looking forward to it. I am going to try one more time, then dump this piece of machinery out."
5,Works as expected,"This product works great, if the unit kept in the freezer for long enough, the consistency of the ice cream gets very good. It's easy to clean as well. I bought an ice cream maker so I could use organic ingredients, and everything has turned out fantastic so far. I have no complaints."
5,Great Machine,"I own this machine, and have had lots of fun making ice cream with it time and time again. I've owned it for about 3 years now... It works great. Some people recommend buying an extra freezer bowl--but I think i'm going to just buy a whole 'nother unit, since the bowl is $30 and the unit is $48... so for $18 I'm getting the ability to make two batches... and at the exact same time!"
4,Purchased it twice,I liked this ice cream maker so much I purchased it twice. The second machine was for my father in law. It is really easy to make and enjoy ice cream right away with this machine. There are only two things I would like to change about this machine. The first is the noise. It is noisy but I assume a real rock salt ice cream maker would be just as noisy or worse. The second would be the fact that it does not freeze the ice cream as hard as I would like. This may be due to my impatience. The ice cream tastes great and we use this machine regularly. I would recommend this machine to everyone.
5,Cuisinart Ice-Cream Machine,"This machine does exactly what we expected it to do. It makes ice-cream quickly and with almost no effort, unlike our White Mountain hand crank freezer. Yes, the ice-cream is soft when it comes out of the freezer, be patient, put in your freezer for a while and it comes out perfect. We highly recommend this product."
5,A Great Little Machine!,"I purchased this ice cream maker so that my husband and I can enjoy low or no carb ice cream. It makes the best ice cream, easy clean up. The one thing I did wrong the first time I attempted to use it was to pour the mix in BEFORE turning on the machine---NOT VERY SMART! The mixture froze along the bottom and sides in no time, and my machine jammed. After that first fiasco, my homemade ice cream has been yummy!"
5,Very happy with it-- make sure to fully freeze the bowl,"I'm thrilled with this machine. It's not very loud, it's light (I've brought it over to parties to make dessert while we're eating dinner) and it's extremely easy. So far I've followed the included recipes for ""Premium Vanilla Ice Cream"" (with peppermint patties mashed-in), ""Strawberry Ice Cream"" and ""Fresh Lemon Sorbet""... the last two, in particular, got outstanding reviews from all who tasted them.My only advice is to make sure the freezer bowl freezes for at least 24 hours before use.. I tried it once after about 15 hours of freezing and my Blood Orange Sorbet came out way too slushy."
5,wow!!!,"Just had our first batch of ice cream from this product. All I can say is ""WOW"". Easy to use, great end results and fun. My husband couldn't tell the difference between this ice cream and the store bought kinds. I would highly recommend this to anyone for ease of use and cleanup."
5,simple and works great!,I love the red!! It brightens up the kitchen. The machine is very simple and works great!... I would recommend this machine for anyone who would like frozen treats at home.
5,"A simple, but cogent work on Hermeneutics","Stein's book is a relatively simple, but concise and cogent work on Hermeneutics. The first several chapters deal with general hermeneutics and the second half of the book deals with specific hermeneutics. The book will provide you with hermeneutical terminology that is extremely helpful, based on E.D. Hirsch's ideas. For example, in a given biblical text, you will learn the differences between what the subject matter is, the meaning of the text (authorial intent), the implications, the norms of language and utterance, the significance of the text (which is application), etc. In addition, you will learn specific hermeneutical principles for different biblical genres. I highly recommend this book for your library!"
4,Very Good and Easy to Read,"If you're interested in learning the basics of proper Biblical hermeneutics, this is a book for you. Stein does a good job presenting the material in an easy-to-read fashion, yet writes in a very scholarly manner. The book is divided into two sections: The first section deals with the general rules of interpretation (the first four chapters); the second section deals with how to interpret proverbs, prophecies, poetry, idioms, hyperboles, parables, narratives, epistles, covenants, laws, and songs (chapters 5-13). The book is generally geared towards the average lay person or beginner seminary student. It can be used as a technical hermeneutical aid or as a tool to assist the average believer in how to read the Bible properly during Bible studies and quiet times. Stein's book is a valuable resource that should be available in every Christian bookshelf."
5,Very good introduction to sound Biblical interpretation,Dr. Stein's text is as good a book as he is a professor. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in sound methods to Biblical interpretation. It is easy to read and very easy to understand. A very good book for lay people in the church who are looking for help in interpreting Biblical passages. Very good!!!
3,Kites Are Fun Import Release,"If you are a Free Design Fan, you'll definitely like the CD, especially if you have not heard the material for a number of years. Where the disc falls short is in the re-mixing. I have the original vinyl and I heard distict differences in the CD. I don't know if they had the original masters in Japan, but not only are the mixes different, but the first note of the bass solo in the beginning of Kites Are Fun is distorted. It sounds like someone was riding the levels and brought down the volume on the bass by the third note.All that being said; the disc does sound good overall."
5,Superb audio book as well,"My schedule doesn't permit a lot of free time for reading so I randomly picked up Theroux's collected stories from the local library and I must say that the storylines are intriguing and the characters are so believable, you may very well find yourself empathizing with them.This is a fantastic collection of stories if you have a long commute and need a break from the rubbish on the airwaves."
5,Son's Xmas request,"I ordered exactly what my son wanted which were these extension bars, he was very pleased when he opened them!"
1,Larry,Buyer beware! The technical spec says you get 29 pieces - with pictures of reamers. You actually only get the index box. Very misleading! This one is going back ASAP.
3,What Could Have Been,"The ragga era and beyond has not been well represented in dub. Thats why I was excited to hear what a Donovan Germain dub treatment of some of the most crucial reggae to appear since the 90's would sound like.I was somewhat disappointed. The recording starts out wicked and finishes with buju's voice phasing through an energetic track. The rest of it is pretty much instrumentals of some of the best reggae in years; but without a trace of Buju's vocals or anything else inventive.This recording is good, but I think it could have been SO much better."
3,"it was ok, no BIG deal","for a player who has just begun playing in this realm then it may be of some use, but it gives to broad an overview to get any real information on it, for that get the cam[paign setting"
3,Not for everyone,"Although some parts of this book contain useful advice, I am somewhat disappointed in it. First, Dershowitz too often uses this book as a sound board to express his political views about topics such as.. defense lawyers, judges, politics, etc. He comes off sounding arrogant and wastes the time of a reader who, like me, was looking for practical advice and lessons based upon his vast experience as an attorney, rather than his defense of his personal views of politics, law, and life in general. Second, this book is largely geared towards criminal law. I understand that this is what Dershowitz has spent his career practicing, but far too many chapters only apply to those who are interested in pursuing careers in criminal law. The book would be more aptly titled ""Letters To A Young Criminal Lawyer."" That is why I believe this book is not appropriate for everyone. There must be books written by well-known attorneys that dispense far better advice than this one."
2,Disappointed.,"For a Harvard law professor with extensive practical experience this book is disappointing. Mr. Dershowitz relies heavily on quotations from his previous books (sometimes quoting sections twice) and at times dispenses trivial advice. For those (like me) who have read some of his other books, Letters is repetitive and the non-repetitive portions are insubstantial. Ironically Mr. Derschowitz includes a chapter on how professors should publish without peer review and not be reluctant to get less-than-perfect writing out to the public. He followed his own advice a little too literally with this hastily drafted book. For an introduction to Dershowitz, I recommend his other books."
3,An easy read,"I happen to like Dershowitz in general.This is a a collection of observations and opinions about the field of law, and some of the critical points in a young lawyers career that he/she will have to reconcile, mostly regarding ethics, work/life balance, and pursuing one's ideal position.I get the feeling that he didn't have to work very hard to write it, but it was still worth reading."
2,Good but lacking details,"The book is better than other ATL titles. I found the book to be lacking in technical details - the author was obviously rushed. I had to read a lot of the ATL code to figure out how aggregation worked, for example. I appreciated the excellent detail-rich coverage of connection points. Unfortunately, there is little to no coverage of non-MFC lightweight windowing classes. Not a book for beginners as a lot of the technical details are left for the reader to discover on his/her own."
3,Good content but his editor needs to keep his/her day job,"This book has a good coverage of ATL. However, the grammar is poor. This often makes the point hard to understand. Also, the book has spelling errors on nearly every page. A programmer need not use perfect grammer (I sure don't) but his editor should have caught this."
4,"This is a ""Good First Book"" for developers..","this is a good first book. Not for advanced ATL stuff. Also, if you do not know the COM concepts, better go get some other book for that, first. This is very good for someone who is trying to start ATL programming. Nice example flow, using both MFC and ATL. I would say, you will need to read this book surely once and only once."
4,Excellent ATL Beginners Book,"This book is excellent for those unfamiliar with ATL. It provides a good overview of COM basics, template basics, and how ATL works and how to use it. My only complaint is that it could have more details and depth, but perhaps that belongs in another book. His approach is clear, step-by-step and great for learning (as well as for simple reference). I highly recommned it."
4,Good Workout For Your Entire Body,"I had the original ""Prime Time"" workout VHS tape for 16 years and used it so much I wore mine out too. This workout is a great workout for all parts of your body. The aerobic part is short but challenging. The sit ups,ballet bar and leg work really make you feel like you are making progress but without being too hard core. (I usually fast fwd thru the arm work because I find it boring)After using this tape consistently you may find that you'll need to move on to something a little more challenging. This is a good tape to fall back on when you have had a lapse in exercise and need to get back on track. I really like it.I was really happy to see that it is offered on Amazon."
1,Poor music!,"I love progressive music but this is not a good example. Of course Mr. Bollenberg has good friends - Rick Wakeman, Jordan Rudes, etc but definitely it is not enough. The music here is terrible!!!"
5,just assuming ...,"I haven't read it and just bought it to see what it felt like in English ; I just leafed through it and thought it seemed properly translated - at first sight, of course. Yet, I do know the original, in French, and it is amongst the loveliest things I have ever read ; not ""great literature"" (but then, what is great literature if not a label stuck on a book by some people whose tastes and interests you might not share ?), but truly well-written, very finely observed and incredibly charming. However, I'll admit that you have to be French to fully appreciate some of the chapters, though not all of them, fortunately. I strongly recommend it !!!"
2,Inaccurate Description,"The description of the product was not accurate. It stated that it was ""slightly worn"" and did not mention extensive writing on the inside flyleaf of the book. As the book is out of print, copies are difficult to locate. The writing negated its usefulness as an intended gift. The vendor and Amazon were extremely responsive and processed my request to return the book and the associated refund very quickly."
1,"Pretentious, empty, stupid","Mindless dribble, pompous musings over obsolete things and experiences.Un-original, pretentious, empty, un-interesting, un-entertaining.No insights, no enlightenment, no humor.There's nothing here."
5,Metallica,"Great Cd with pretty good covers. However this would appeal to heavy metal fans because of the loud, gutteral lyrics which some people like and some don't."
1,when you try to fake something at least do it right,next time don't just shout it. it's a song you should sing it. don't waste money on this crap buy the real thing.
1,They need to take a cue from Metallica,"If they want to cover some of the greatest songs ever made, maybe they should learn something from them. First, you do not scream. James Hetfield actually sings through his lyrics, and when he does the occasional scream, it sounds intellegable. Next, Metallica has an elegance that no one else seems to have. Instead of just thrashing away, they put together musical selections that rival the complexitites of symphonies. Quite simply, they are the best musicians rock has ever known.Just buy the real thing, and leave this tripe alone."
3,"Why ""Tribute""...","Why ""tribute"" is needed for Metallica... because Metallica is no more a load of metal. Metallica was the load in late 80's but after ""and justice for all"" Metallica died. Recent Metallica plays just like a girl pop or heavy country music. Late 80's Metallica was more respectable."
1,Learn to play with some melody first.,"Metallica is about more than being heavy that's one thing only true Metallica fans can tell. They not only write songs well, but the preform well. What these bands don't understand is that there is more to metaly than meets the eye. Metallica preforms well so I would not recomend purchace of this cd."
2,Still a fan,This album is a poor excuse for a tribute for a band as great as MetallicA. Don't waste your money.
3,Dont try to redo what has already been greatly done.,"Its hard trying to reproduce the hard sounds of Metallica. Its like trying to reproduce Jimi Hendrix. Unless you are great fans of the mentioned bands or you like collecting anything that has Metallica's name mentioned on it then get the CD. Otherwise, tape it from a friend."
4,Wanna Be Metallica,Metallica can play anyone else's songs but NO ONE can do theirs.(Well Not Perfectly) Fade To Black is good as is Whiplash. Heavy.
4,A rage-Inducing sonic assult,"I really believe James & Lars Intended for their music to stay heavy, and this disc puts the thunder back into the name of Metallica. I believe most of the so-called ""death-metal"" acts featured on this disc all sound alike, but the best interpretation here is Terror's version of Jump In the Fire."
3,No way to connect to video,"For a computer that bills itself as a Media Center you would think there would be some way to connect to video Media. I had to buy a separate video capture card for $70. Also, Amazon says there is a second CD drive. At least on the one I got there is only one CD/DVD drive."
4,Great price for what you get!,"Like others have said, you really got a lot for the price, I got mine for $499 with a 17' flat panel CRT monitor! (This was after $250 in rebates.) Great deal! It's amazing to me that the 1710NX was selling for $419 for just the CPU and only has 256 MB of RAM 100 Gig hard drive and no DVD Burner or Lightscribe! Also no monitor included! Also, this was has an AMD Athlon 64 3500 versus a Sempron on the 1710NX model. Also has a better keyboard. (No flat hard to type on keys.) I am very happy with this product."
1,45 min to load,"Ok lots of good reviews but my experiance is a bad one. Took me 45 min to load the first time. Restarts take about 8 min or so. Keeps locking up for no apparent reason. I will be taking this one back. Sounds like a great deal at the store but after getting home and trying to work with it, not impressed. My emachine that I was replacing is faster than this compaq that I bought at CompUsa. I will not recommend this machine."
2,Pamphlet,"It should be noted that this work,as are most of Holmes products, is a stapled pamphlet. Given the paucity of accessable material on the Oracles, this Westcott translation (based on Patrizzi 1593) is not without value."

4,Classic..,"This CD is pretty damn good.. they just don't make rap like this anymore. Featuring some -wicced- traccs from Mr. Doctor, his partna Foe Loco (a complete undiscovered talent still..) and others in the Odysea clicc, this CD basically marks the end of the era when Sacramento rap -really- was at the top of its game. After this, it would be left to only Lynch, C-Bo, X-Raided, First Degree, and Luni Coleone to try to hold together the Sacramento reputation, when once there were almost 20 rappers in their prime coming from Sacramento, who were virtually taking over the California rap scene.If you don't like this for some reason, then go grab ""Foe Loco - Foecus"" (or Re-Foecussed, they're basically the same CD). THAT album is guaranteed to knocc your soccs off."
4,Not a bad album,"I decided to finally listen to the entire album, ""Intuition"" by Linx after havingthe vinyl for decades (with only listening to the short version of ""You're Lying""in the past). It is not a bad album. The songs are nice to listen to with may1 or 2 filler. Of course I got this CD for the 12"" version of ""You're Lying"" inthe version that was typically played on R&B; stations in the early 80s. I was happyto finally get a clean version of that song (after having the vinyl 12"" version)(a youtube version I posted if you're interested is here[...])Overall it is a pretty good listen.TC"
3,Study the doctrine of the LDS church,"B.H. Roberts has made wonderful contributions to church literature. He wrote the manuscript for this book under the knowledge he had at the time.However, in 1909 and reiterated in 1925, The First Presidency have declared there are NO ""Pre-Adamites.""THERE ARE NO PRE-ADAMITES.The scriptures alone teach this, and countless quotes from latter-day apostles and prophets.The 2nd of Elder McConkie's ""Seven Deadly Heresies"" is to follow the false notion of Adam being a result of organic evolution. I am not saying there is zero evolution, of course there is. But it is NOT the process that mankind and Adam came from. This is a fallacy to tarnish the sanctity of Adam's true nature, being born in the image of God."
4,Great summary but it does not replace the real thing,"In 1997, Theresa W. Fossum and 4 colleagues wrote a comprehensive book on Small Animal Surgery. I have not seen it but I have heard excellent comments about its illustrations and descriptions. For this reason, I bought the Manual thinking that it was a summary of the larger text. Great disappointment! It is a summary but without pictures! Paraphasing Alice: ""What good is a surgery book without pictures?"" There is nothing wrong with the Manual, except the absence of pictures; I don't feel secure trying to image operating procedures guided only by text, regardless how good it is. The Manual costs $ 50 against $ 150 de original; I should have sprung the full price and bought the original."
3,Kamp Rite Storage Bag,"The picture of the storage bag made me think it was long, like the length of the cot. The storage bag is so small it is no real loss to not have one. The storage capacity is about the same as a gym bag."
3,How About A Volume 2,"KISS, THE 20th CENTURY MASTERS DVD is alright for the 8 or 10 bucks that you will spend on it. The Videos on this disc are:1.I Love It Loud,2.Lick It Up,3.Heaven's On Fire,4.Tears Are Falling,and 5.Crazy Crazy Nights. Granite there have could have been more cause where talking about KISS here but then again. I really hope KISS decides to put out a Video collection on DVD. This DVD is a alright DVD and a good Collector's item for a KISS fan."
4,Good for the fan,"I enjoyed the Vid for I LOVE IT LOUD, but the rest are just a waste of space. Nice to have as a small collection, but really not worth it in the KISS universe. I bought it because I am a KISS fan.The concept of the MILLENIUM MASTERS is basically a small sample of either CD material, or in this case Video material is put out as an example of the artists work. So, its meant for someone who is not a fan. That way, they can get a collection of artists across a broad spectrum. So, the purpose of this very repetitive collection is not for the fan to buy it, but for the non fan to shell out a small amount and see what any particular artist is like. The amount of small sample discs, video and cd, is getting very large. I suspect it is very much a marketing ploy."
3,Not enough...,"KISS ha dnothing to do with this dvd. Lets make that clear. Now... the main problem with this dvd is there is only 5 videos. They are good songs and good videos, nice to see the 80's KISS in the spotlight. Most of these videos can be seen on the kISS exposed dvd. But then again, this dvd is very cheap in price, so it is a deal per sey. Good for the person who just wants some KISS videos for pocket change. People exploring KISS for the first time will like this, fanatic fans will buy it, if you are the more causual fan. Get Exposed or the Alive IV DvD."
3,Isnt comparable to the other KISS release,Really small budget dvd or just a `quick one`no stories no nothing just 5 videos from the 80s.Well the dvd isnt a lot but they dont ask a lot for it.One of the reasons to buy this would be because of the `i love it loud`video the others are good but thats the one that holds up on this dvd.The videos included are1.i love it loud2.lick it up3.heaven`s on fire4.tears are falling5.crazy nightsIf you really want a good dvd with videos try `konfidential and extreme close-up`or eXposed that would be worth your money unlike this stuff that i dont recomend unless youre a die-hard like me.I give it 3 stars because im a KISS fan but other wise its just a quick release by 20th century company they also did cds but they arent much better than this.Well deceving i wish like another rewiewer said they would make a 70s video collection and an 80s-90s video collection that would be great.3 stars because i love KISS.
5,"Wow was Gene hot in ""Heavens on Fire""","This is the BEST way to bring a KISS concert into your living room! (a real one would damage your sofa) only the I Love it Loud video has the guys in their full KISS duds, but Its all still worth while. C'mon! Whats not when it involves KISS? The vids are awesome, and you get a much better view of all the KISS stunts than if you were there live. All the guys were great on this compelation, but Gene really knocked my...um..socks off! In the vid for ""Heavens on Fire"" he's wearing a white button up shirt partly undone, and sure, he looks GREAT in black, but the white is REALY REALY REALY nice too! And insted of the traditional pony tail thing, his hairs down and all straitened, its very hot. Ok, I better go calm myself down, I DEFINATLY recomend this DVD. It's not a want, its a NEED!"
1,THIS LISTING IS NUTS!,"Mine cost $1 at the Dollar Store and it kept coming apart so I epoxied it together. Two weeks later it fell apart again, and then I noticed the mold on the wood. Out it went. GO PLASTIC! Lexan if you can find it."
2,TOO THIN,"I cannot wear this alone. I'll have to wear something over it or a bra under it. Nice color, though."
5,Great Book for Direct Marketing,"This book covers mainly the topics direct mail (mail package, letter, response form ec.). It also covers topics like brochures, print ads and catalogs. But there are also some additional chapters on the radio ads and the internet (aka online media). The later one was highly stimulating and provoked a partial redo of the website I build as part of my work as a centermanager...."
3,Bland,"This book gives the reader a surface view of SGI in the UK but the leaves out any in-depth analysis. For this reason I found this book quite disappointing. It seems the authors did not want to take sides and just produced something that is quite flat and bland. Some comparisons of SGI UK and other movements such as Scientology were useful but too short. Moreover, for people not familiar with the terminology of the SGI UK movement this book may be hard to follow."
3,so good information,"thought that this product would have chants included in the book, but was a dissappointment when they were not. will look for something else...."
2,A decent beginning but needs more,"I have been developing training for SAP for nearly ten years and decided to write a book on the process. Before beginning, I wanted to know if there was already a book in the industry and this book is all I could find. Some things in it are useful and I saved about five pages that I refer to now and then. If lacks usable forms on a cd that would make it more helpful. It is not written for either a novice or an expert. I find it lacks specific detail and a easy to use format for novices. However, it does not offer enough depth for experts. So I thought it a good beginning and the only one in the marketplace. However, it could be much more valuable with some changes in format, adding forms and checklists on a cd, and choosing between going into greater depth or more detail for novices...pick one and expand this."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with this book. It appears to be a compliation of various documents and forms just thrown together. Some of it is very, very basic and generic. I was looking for much more SAP specific information."
4,cook books,"quick,safe delivery.books in great shape for their age (40 yrs old )Very useful and beautiful illustrations. I enjoy this set very much as do my neighbors."
1,Total gibberish,"The rantings of a lunatic, so typical of the far right. Totally undocumented: backed up by nothing more than an overactive, paranoid imagination. Mr. Kent obviously knows few liberals and has read very little of the works of serious progressives. The folks who scarf up this kind of garbage - and you know who you are - will of course love it, as it reinforces all their existing prejudices and relieves them of the obligation to do anything with their mind except to reinforce their blind hatred of people who disagree with them."
1,the evil of conservatism,"this is a horroble book that supports obviously the right side.it's a book that comes from the point of few that the poor should just shut up and be happy for what they get.it's an attack on being tolerant of other individuals and supports the death penalty. every man for himself and screw your fellow man.wants to take public education away and every other individual right that has beem won by liberals,except it supports gun rights."
4,I Turn to Melanie,"Melanie C was called ""Sporty Spice"" while she was in Spice Girls. When she started to make solo carriere I actually what kind of music there was to come. The album was in my head before it was recorded. There's a hard rock song ""Goin' Down"", some hip-hop music ""Never Be the Same"", peaceful songs ""Norther Star"", ""If That Were Me"", ""Suddenly Monday"" etc. and ""happy"" pop songs ""I Turn to You"" and ""Go!"". Melanie is one of the best vocalist that was in Spice Girls (there was no bad vocalist)...she sings beautifully and she has depth in her voice and she can sing different kinds of songs.Stars: I Turn to You, If That Were Me, Goin' Down"
4,Great CD with a hint of Garbage,Really good pop/rock CD. This is a lot better than geri halliwel.Another good CD is Emma Bunton(baby spice).
4,This is great!,"I just purchased this item from amazon and judt got it in the mail today. I already love it! The reason I only gave it four stars was because I didn't really like the song ""Goin' Down"". It was a little too hard core rockin' roll for me I guess. Otherwise,Melanie does awesome as a solo artist. My favorite songs are ""Northern Star"",""I Turn To You"",""Closer"",and ""Feel The Sun."" This is an awesome cd!!!!!"
5,An excellent compilation of music -- very diverse,"This really is a very good CD. I am genuninely impressed. Although I'd heard/and liked the dance track ""I Turn to You"", I was pleasantly surprised when I saw Mel C in concert. She's a great performer and has a fantastic voice. Her music is very non-Spice Girl-esque, a mixture of alternative rock/pop and dance. ""Closer"", ""Why"" and ""Never Be the Same Again"" are all really good, and the Hex Hector remix of ""I Turn to You"" is a great track. The title track rocks too. A fantastic start to a solo career."
1,Melanie C's Album is Not Dance,"This album is really not for those people who liked the song ""I Turn To You"" by Melanie C [also known from Louie DeVito's NYC Underground Party Vol. 3]. The only song on Melanie C's album Northern Star that is dance music/techno is 'I Turn To You' which is track 04, and it probably is not even the right version. Track 14 is probably close to the version you may have heard which is ""I Turn To You [Hex Hector Radio Mix]."" But I recommend buying Louie DeVito's NYC Underground Party Volume 3 if you want to hear dance music because Melanie C does have her song 'I Turn To You' on there and there are various other artists on there that make the album good. If you want proof that what I am saying is correct, go to www.fye.com and hear every single track for yourself."

2,melanie c rocks,she has made a good albums and this one wasnt that betterthan emmas albums or victorias.shes my favorite spice but afterthe 90s is started to like all of them really.she was nice andbrave i dont know as shes doing now tho without the spice girlsbeacuase when shed perform with them shed bring the word spiceinto spice girls. there is alot of rock music in this albumtoo! it would make a reat spice girls collection or melanie cfan collection so buy it!
1,Sorry.... I cannot give it less than one star.,"You are kidding me, right? This ""group"" epitomizes all that was wrong with music in the 80's. The total lack of musical talent barely masked by over-produced electronic enhancment, while shredding not one but TWO classic rock and roll ballads. This CD is not worthy to be utilized as a coaster for a cheap light beer. Run away. Very fast."
1,Unforgivable,"If ever negative values were deserved, this is the one. Not that Baby I Love Your Way was all that good to begin with, but to first pair it with Freebird and then to give the Skynyrd song a worse turn than Frampton - unbelievable that we had to suffer through this schlock (can't use a stronger word on Amazon.com) in 1988. Horrible, unforgivable, just about as bad as 1980s music gets."
5,Bob & David Kill With 4th Season,"As a loyal Mr. Show fan from day one, I was thrilled when the seasons began appearing on DVD. Season 4 is, by far, the best season, and the most entertaining DVD.With episodes like ""Life is Precious, and God, and the Bible"", and ""Patriotism, Pepper, Professionalism"", Bob and David demonstrate again and again why they are probably the most under-rated comics in America today.Bouncing between absurdist sketch plots and clever one-liners, the show manages to blend straightforward visual comedy with more complex references and subtle punchlines. Humor snob or not, Mr. Show will make you laugh out loud time and again through season 4."
4,Get the whole collection!,"Chances are if you watch one season of Mr. Show you will immediately become addicted and want to see the others. If you can get the whole collection for under $60 or better yet under $50, then you will most likely save money than if you buy one season at a time for 20-30 dollars. As for season four specifically, I can't really pick out a favorite as I believe every season has had it's absolute golden moments. To each his own, but get the whole collection. That way you won't miss anything!"
2,"""Probably"" homosexual?","Many artists mentioned in this book are thought ""might have homosexual tendencies"" or ""probably homosexual"" or supported the ""homosexual rights efforts"" and ""rights of abortion""; others had mistresses, were heretics of the church or...I'm sorry, but this book is about the sexual lives of these artists as much as it is about their artistry; also the assumptions made about one artist being ""probably homosexual""...please...""probably""? Are you guessing? Hoping?I enjoyed the book, but buying this for your child might not be what you thought.Second recommendation: Add photographs to the ""Artworks"" section. I went to the web to look up the art mentioned, but still....hassle."
2,Not Recommended as a Textbook,"I adopted Introduction to the Bible as my textbook for a 100-level Bible survey course at a four-year liberal arts college, and I have been sorely disappointed. While the content is generally sound and the approach and coverage suitable for the course, the price is absurdly high for what you get (even with Amazon's generous discount). There are no additional resources for instructors, and the book's design is aesthetically uninviting, which makes it all the more difficult to get students to do the reading."
3,Introduction to the Bible,"The shipping for the book took longer than when it said it would arrive.The book is very overpriced and not worth it especially if you already understand the bible, but it is required for Christian Scriptures.The contents of this book helped me understand the bible better because it gave the historical and literary world. It also talked about the contemporary world. Sometimes the book doesn't go into great detail over the contemporary world as much as they would go over historical or literary."
5,I Received the Right Book,"I received the correct book for my Biblical Traditions class. If you take this class at University of Portland and your class requires it, this is the book for you."
3,Introuduction to the Bible,"Although I was please with the purchase and price, I was a little diappointed in the conduct of the book. I knew it won't be in mint condition but it was in somewhat worst condition that I expected.Thank you.Joe Sweeney"
4,good basic information for the breed,"I was surprised to see Robert Pollet, a French specialist in BSDs and Schipperkes, writing a book for the UK/English language pet/show market. I met him over 20 years ago at the Paris Specialty for the Belgian breeds (all 4 BSD varieties and the Schipperke as well). He has a good solid grounding in the breed and its behaviour and the book addresses many of the basic backgrounds and problems in the breed. He was astute enough to utilize photographs of UK bred dogs for the main, so I would think that this book would do well with the pet market here in the UK, as it has been many years since a book was written about the breed. The standard laid out in the book is the UK Kennel Club's Breed standard for the breed.Mary Deats (Aradet Schipperkes, and international judge of the breed in USA/Canada/UK and Europe)"
4,Maverick!!,"Everyone should read this fascinating inside look at John McCain. He does not hold back with his past and helps us see where he comes from today. Especially his quick temper and his refusal to go along with the majority. He has a long history of being a trouble maker just for the fun of it! His ""Oh, Well"" and ""but it was all in good fun"" attitude got him in plenty of hot water with his superiors. He owes a great deal of gratitude to his grandfather and father for excusing his behavior. This was his way of coping with prison. Unfortunately the American People are not the enemy now! This book helped explain some of the decisions he makes and is now making at the close of this election!"
5,Integrity has no ideology,"I'm a bleeding heart liberal. You can probably hear my knee jerking from wherever you're reading this. But I'm impressed as hell with Senator McCain's book -- and life. He doesn't try to go over the top about his heroism; he doesn't bang home the fact that many of us would have gone nuts in the prison camp, and that he's a remarkable survivor. He talks about the lessons he learned while living in hell, and draws the connections between his experiences and those of his forbears.Good read, warts and all. It would not be a bad thing for the country to have John McCain and Bill Bradley engaging in weekly debates -- thoughtful, reasonable debates -- about the future of the country."
4,An American Hero,"While this book could have benefitted from tighter editing, it is worth sticking with to be amazed by the extraordinary heroism displayed by the Arizona senator during his long and distinguished career. Few Americans could fathom the suffering he and his fellow POWs endured to serve our country and, no matter what you think of his politics, you will come away with not only great respect for his honor and service, but a sense of pride that people like him continue to sacrifice for the freedom of the USA."
2,Honor to the Navy?,I felt this book does not reflect on the expected behaviors of honorable servicemen in the Navy. Such conduct demeans Mr McCain and certainly the Navy Academy. Do all navy people have to depend on fathers and grandfathers for favors? The book leaves one with a less than favorable impression.
2,Judging a book by its cover,"Dag, but McCain was a buck in his youth! I could gaze at this cover for hours."
1,ghost written,"John McCain did not write this book. Like everything else about McCain, he lied also about the authorship."
1,Misleading and inaccurate,"According to the US Constitution, American presidents must be born in the USA. McCain fails this test, as he was born in Panama, which is a different country.He fails the test in lots of other ways too. His recent failed attempt to get the Congress to vote for the $700 billion bankers' bail-out bill shows that: 1) he favours the rich against the majority of the American people; and 2) he can't even persuade his fellow-Republicans to support the bill.And his party, and its policy of backing the bankers whatever, has been mainly responsible for the current economic crisis.And if he were to die in office (after all, cancer-sufferers do often suffer relapses), Sarah Palin would become President."
1,Megan is a DING-BAT!!,Megan is a DING-BAT and this book reflects that. I read the book during a six hour plane ride. It left me wishing that I had spent the time just looking out of the window. I prob would have seen Megan somewhere up in the clouds.
2,Must read.,"John Sidney McCain III is running for President, using his experience as a POW as a credential. This book, if closely read, shows exactly how poor a credential his POW experience and conduct is. Two examples (there are more): Within four days of being captured, he specifically admits that he first offered and then provided valid military information so that he could get treatment other POWs in his position didn't get. He details at last two propaganda broadcasts/interviews he gave. Both of those are in direct violation of the Military Code of Conduct that he swore to uphold (and he was not being either tortured or coerced when he did those things -- he did them of his own free will and for his own purposes).McCain is not the hero he portrays himself as being -- at most he is just a survivor, who survived in a less-than-honorable way. The American public really needs to learn the truth about this McCain. This book, if closely read, is a good starting point. I recommend it for that purpose."
2,"Get this one from the Library, don't buy it.","Like many parent's, I would like to think that my children will someday read the books that had an impact on my life, Faith of my Fathers however will not be on the short list. Let me say up front that I am an unabashed supporter of every soldier that ever wore an American uniform in battle. I respect and appreciate what John McCain did. As an American I am in his debt. His book however lacked punch. In my opinion too much time was spent lauding the accomplishments of his father and grandfather. The description of his experiences as a POW were unpleasent, but they paled in comparison to Henri Charriere's description of the conditions on Devil's Island which included the infamous prisoner Papillon."
2,An Ok But about A GREAT American,"John McCain is a great man. A true American Hero. His story is one of courage and faith. I think he will make a great President. However, this book is dull. Some of the parts where he describes life in a Vietnamese POW camp are interesting and must reading. However, as a whole the book is just not as exciting as it should be. McCain is a great man, so hopefully next time around his story will be told in a better way."
5,Stunning Memoir,"I don't particullary care for Senator McCain's political views. But after reading his family memoir, I think McCain has had a very interesting life. His experiences in VietNam seem so gruesome. It was also interesting to get to learn about McCain's father and grandfather. If you are wanting to learn about a admirable politician and at the same time learn about the Viet Nam war, you should definitely give this book a try."
4,I enjoyed reading it.,"It is a good book if you have time and interest to learn more about background of John McCain. I enjoyed reading his book, however, I was not sure why McCain went in extensive detail pertaining to his Grandfather. When I purchased the book I was more keen on learning about McCain and his ideology rather then his family history. Nonetheless, learning more about his family history assisted me to understand him in terms of why he has certain policies. By reading this book I realized that Mr. McCain is a very enlightened man regardless the fact if I agree or disagree with his certain policies."
3,"Very inspiring, but a tedious read...","I really admire John McCain, but I found this a tedious read because a lot of the technical Navy-speak that I am unfamiliar with. That said, John McCain is truly an American Hero with the country's best interests at heart. This tale confirmed my decision to vote for him- as Sarah Palin says it best ""The only man in this race who has ever truly fought for Americans."""
4,Inspiring story of courage not seen often in the 90s,"While John McCain's politics are too conservative for me, he still gets my attention for this inspiring story. Parts of his father and grandfather's stories could have been shortened to concentrate more on his struggle in Vietnam. His admission that the North Vietnamese did break him shows his honesty and the depths of his mental struggle. I applaud this valuable American and recommend this book."
4,Know the man behind the Republican nominee.,"What a story! What a life! John McCain has had quite a life in the military. His whole family has. This book has nothing to do with ""party lines"" or politics so regardless if you are a donkey or an elephant you will get something positive out of his story. Check it out!"
4,This is a politician?,"When I first read this book, I could not believe that its author was a presidential candidate. The book has no politicizing - instead it is a very moving and eye opening look at one man's journey into the depths of hell, and back. McCain's writing is impressive and accessible at the same time. It reads pretty quickly despite some dry spots in the middle. For those only interested in political writing, this is not the book for you. For anyone interested in the effects of war, prison, torture, and the enduring power of the human spirit, this book will be a very engaging read."
3,"Poor start, but hooks you later","This book is a great review of McCain's life up to the point where he gets over the huge conflict of being a POW. The beginning of the book was very slow and uninteresting, but as you move further on he really gets his voice. Actually, only a few of the stories about his grandfather and father were really worth reading. When the story got down to McCain's life then it really got interesting. He definitely was a hellion throughout his childhood: A true leader of the rebellious crowd. Don't get me wrong, he also demonstrates that he has a knack for leadership and skilled in many aspects of the military lifestyle. The story truly begins when he gets shot down over Hanoi. His descriptions of the events that follow him landing in the lake are enthralling. It is an amazing story that I am sure affects a lot of his actions to date. I only wished it gave a little more detail about his life after the affects of being a POW."
5,Great story of three American Heros!!!,"You do not have to be a republican or even a McCain supporter to like this book. It is a tremendous tale of the lives of ""Slew"" McCain, ""Jack"" McCain and John McCain. Tells of the lessons John learned from his fathers. His bad habits as a child through the Naval Academy. Then of course his training, his time as a leutinent commander in the Navy in Vietnam. Then of course as a POW and the people he met and the things that he learned there. It was a great book, and I would suggest it to anybody, not just his supporters."
5,The Man is a Hero,I did not vote for Senator John McCain but I have always admired him and thought of him as a hero and not just because he endured years as a POW. His book details so much more about the man and his courage. There are many other books out there about the POW experience from Vietnam but his takes a new direction and is told with great humility and a touch of class.How could anyone read his accounting of his experiences and not be moved. It is written well and provides lots of insight into John McCain.
4,Measure of the Man,"Honor and duty, bravado and pluck, independence and irreverence - these not only define John McCain, but have apparently been passed down through the generations that preceded him. This contemporary memoir almost seems to be from another time, when deeds and valor exemplified leadership much more than speechmaking or image-polishing.His personal history provides a glimpse into how military families think and operate, reflecting both the call to serve and the embrace of adventure that have typified the warrior class throughout the ages. The senator shares instructive snapshots, warts and all, allowing the reader to clearly see what he stands for and what has shaped him. You need not agree with McCain's politics to appreciate and admire what he and his family have contributed to our country."
5,Read The Truth,John McCain gave me more insight into the horrible punishments our prisoners endured in North Vietnam. Any man who underwent these tortures is an American hero. McCain is just a regular guy who displayed uncommon courage. His perspective on life is refreshing.
5,A profile in courage,"A truly fascinating book. This is not the typical self serving political dribble that one would expect from a candidate in an election year. John McCain is very candid in his portrayal of his less than perfect younger days. The wartime tales of Sen. McCain's grandfather and father bring history to life. His portrayal of life as a prisoner of war make the book impossible to put down. The book is written without a political agenda, and serves to remind us of the concepts of honor and commitment to duty and country. An inspiring tale for anyone to read, regardless of their political views"
5,Fantastic Book,"Like THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE ARE FREE, this book celebrates the kind of simple spirit and joys of family and country which warms the heart. A great accomplishement!"
4,Faith of My Fathers by John McCain,This was an excellent book helping me to get to know our candidate for president. It gave me immense respect for him and his strong character and honor.
2,disappointed toastlover,"Despite the high price ,i bought this toaster because I had ""blind faith "" in the Cuisinart name. After a year it's dead ! I had 20$ appliances outliving the short life of this one. Very disappointed !"
2,Frustrating!,"I am so disappointed in this toaster, which is far more expensive than any I've owned before. It doesn't hold the setting - I happen to prefer my toast on the light side, which is a ""2"" on this particular toaster, but I need to set it at that after every piece of toast. The minute the bread pops out, it resets to the default - ""4"". Dry, burnt toast!"
3,Good Toaster if you don't use X-10 Modules,"This is a fine toaster, unless you use X-10 remote control modules in your house. When the toaster is simply plugged in (not operating), it generates interference on the 110V electical line which caused my X-10 modules on the same circuit breaker to stop responding to commands. Unplugging the toaster fixes the X-10 problem, but it is annoying."
3,Too complicated for a toaster,"I've had this toaster for a couple years now and up till a few months ago it worked great. However, the lever on it started sticking, not coming up fast, and there was a smell of burnt plastic. It finally stopped working all together. I took the toaster apart and could not beleive how complicated it was!! Electronics all over the place. No wonder reviews have been all over the place. When you put that much electronics next to heating elements , you are asking for poor quality. I will not be purchasing another one of these. From what I have learned from this toaster and other reviews, when this thing works, it works quite well; however, there are a high percentage that don't. And stay away from refurbished ones. They may have fixed the part that failed, but many times this part failed for some other reason and that root cause will not have been fixed."
1,Disappointed in Cuisinart,"After going through a couple of budget toasters in three years, I decided to go for something better and had heard that Cuisinart made good kitchen appliances. From the beginning, it was a disappointment. It took too long to toast. Then after having the thing for a mere thirteen months it died. What's that I recall hearing about ""planned obsolesence""?"
2,Poor Performance,"I have had the CPT 60 for less than a year - and already, the unit has ceased to function in one slot. This model is not well-made and the performance has been sub-par."
3,Help me catch my flying toast,"With the flying toast from my Cuisinart CPT-60 toaster, my life began to feel like an episode of I Love Lucy. When I looked for a control to adjust the spring, I discovered that it doesn't exist. I decided to give it time, maybe it just needed some breaking in. It's 2 years later and I'm happy to say, that finally, the toast stays put. I would have returned the toaster right away if it weren't for it's space saving design, superb bagel toasting ability and it's great looks. Oh yeah, it's easy to keep clean, too!"
3,"Pretty, but not effective","We have had one for 2-3 years. It has failed.Before it failed, it seldom produced an even browning. I normally toast a single slice. The edges come out much darker than the center. The ""1 slice"" button did not improve this or have any noticable effect."
1,Disappointed,"Reviewers seem to either love or hate their toaster - I hate mine. It takes forever to toast a slice of bread, toasts it unevenly, makes a horrible popup sound and makes the next slices darker. The one-slice feature makes no difference I can see, I have to hit cancel instead of manually popping toast up when smoke begins to roll from the toaster and we are down to 2 lights for regular toast as the toast continues to get darker for the same setting over time. I trusted the Cuisinart name for this product, but never again."
3,Thin Fabric,"Good bag with lots of pockets and wide opening, however, fabric is thin and may not last very long with heavy use. Good for sports where equipment is not too heavy or sharp."
5,GREAT Gift,Ordered this book so I could donate the money to a rescue. I was very surprised to find that the book was such a good one. I plan to order more for Christmas presents for people I know.
5,Lots of good stuff inside,"I saw this book when rummaging around in the windows 2000 stacks at amazon. The book is big! there's a lot of good hands-on exercises and reveiw questions at the end of every chapter, which really helps me remember the material after finishing up the chapter. I really liked the chapters on active directory, dns, wins, proxy. one things fer sure, i've got a lot ot studying ahead of me! this book's a great start."
5,Great Book and Resource,"Noticed this book while browsing Amazon and decided to pick it up. Very glad I did. Provides great info. on 2000, and helps show what sort of information we'll need to know for the new exam track. The sections on Active Directory were fantastic! In my opinion, this is a great pre-study book for anyone looking to explore the new MCSE 2000 exams- and I think will serve as a valuable reference tool as well."
2,MCSE Windows 2000 Certification Headstart,"This book lacked depth. It covers all the essentials but leaves big gaps. For example: in setting up sites, this books does not adequately cover subnets, nor how to add objects to the site."
3,"Fun for vintage Sci-Fi fans, but not what I expected.","Overall, I enjoyed the stories, particularly 'SRL Ad', 'Shipshape Home', and 'F---'. The stories that inspired 'Twilight Zone' TV episodes were more of a mixed bag, however, and definitely were improved in the move to television.The title story is really the highlight of the book, which is why it was a bit disappointing that none of the other stories fit in with 'Duel'. This should have been promoted as a science-fiction anthology. Matheson was clearly inspired by Bradbury, although at times, his work seems derivative, with a lot of '1950s' style dialogue applied to the 'distant future'...of the 1990s!An interesting introduction (for me) to the work of a writer I'd been curious about."
2,Do not buy this book unless you like dated science fiction!!,"The title of this book is intentionally misleading. What it should be is ""Duel: DATED SCIENCE FICTION Stories by Richard Matheson"". With only a couple exceptions, the stories in this book are not ""Terror Stories"", but in fact a bunch of old science fiction stories that Matheson wrote in the 1950's.When I discovered this I was extremely annoyed, because I love Horror, but hate Science Fiction. I had read I AM LEGEND by Matheson, and enjoyed this story immensely. I was looking forward to reading other ""horror"" stories by Matheson. What I got was a lot of dated sci-fi.This was a shameless attempt by the publisher to market some very old (and very good) science fiction as a new Horror short story collection. By the misleading title, the publisher is trying to deceive Horror fans, like myself, into purchasing a recyled Sci-Fi book. The publisher should be ashamed for this unethical marketing attempt."
2,You Can Get Duel in a Better Matheson Anthology Collection called The Incredible Shrinking Man,"My rating of this collection does not reflect the senstational story Duel but that story is also available in another anthology collection calledThe Incredible Shrinking Man. That collection in my opinion is a much better buy as it also has Matheson's brilliant story The Shrinking Man. You can buy that story on its own as a stand alone story if you have already purchased this book by dropping the word incredible in the Amazon search engine or just clicking on this linkThe Shrinking Man (Sf Masterworks). The shrinking man is a great story of a normal guy who keeps shrinking and makes the ultimate enemy of a black widow spider.So buy this collection Duel: Terror Stories if it is cheaper if you just want Duel but the other stories within this anthology to be honest with you are extremely average. If you want two good stories however, buy The Incredible Shrinking Man titled anthology instead!"
5,short stories,"I was first introduced to Matheson through his famous novel, I am Legend. That novel and the short stories included with it impressed me very much. That impression has continued to grow as I've read books like Duel. Matheson writes very competently and always manages to surprise you as he displays his monsters, aliens, and human madmen. This book is well worth your time. It's one I know I will read over and over again."
3,5 Stars For Duel and 1 Star For The Rest,"As an admirer of Matheson, it pains me to give this rating to a collection of his short stories. Duel is as good as advertised. It stands up well next to the 1971 movie by the same name and is as good as anything Matheson has written. But the rest of the stories in are as dated as a Victrola. B movie themes from the 50s permeate this group. Pure dreck. Barely interesting even as a period piece, each offering is just another variation of sci-fi silliness in the vain of 'I Was A Teenage Werewolf' but without the campy charm. Matheson has written many worthwhile stories and a reader would be rewarded by seeking them out. These selections (Duel excepted) are not among them."
3,"Sci-fi, not terror","I purchased this book after seeing the Stephen Spielberg movie ""Duel."" However, the actual story that the film is based on is much shorter than I excepted. I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't longer. Most of the other stories, while good, are mostly science fiction, and not terror stories. In conclusion, don't buy unless you are a science fiction fan."
3,Not too terrible. . .,"There wer some really good stories, but others were not exactly what i'd call terrifying, lol. The ones which were frightful though, were pretty good."
4,A Terrific Collection,"This is a terrific collection of Matheson's short stories from the 1950s. More sci-fi than horror, they still wallop a stiff punch of weird. Some of the premises are dated (1950's aliens, space ships, nuclear war, etc), but Matheson is amazing at delivering the pulpy paranoia and he is a master of twist endings. My favorite is The Last Day, a horrific tale of returning home before the world is destroyed. Of course, the title story Duel is a classic and worth the admission alone. Other notable tales are Return, Shipshape Home, Death Ship, Being, and Steel. If you're a fan of stories similar to the original Twilight Zone (indeed, some of these tales were made into episodes), then this is a perfect collection."
2,knight rider season 4,I think it would be great if I could only get the product. the first one grew legs and walked off. the replacement should be here Mon or Tues.
3,What kind of cheap discs did they use?,"I love the show, but I own every season. And every season has at least one ""problem disc"" that has trouble playing (if it plays at all) in whatever DVD Player I put it in, even my computer."
2,A good show that goes from its best season to its worst,"It's amazing what a season makes. The third season was by far the best of the series, but the fourth was the worst. The storylines were boring and the addition of Super Pursuit Mode made the show look cheesy and stupid (though the function did look cool in the dark). There were many episodes in which K.I.T.T's major functions (turbo boost, super pursuit mode, eject left/right) were hardly, if at all used. I recommend Season three, followed by a tie for Seasons 1 and 2."
2,They tarted KITT Up!,"I stopped watching KR after about 5 episodes into this last season. They tarted the car up, totally dismantling what the car was about to make it some cheesy street racer. So they could introduce hip youngsters. That isn't why I watched the show, thank you. And it IS why I STOPPED watching the show. When it was cancelled, it was a mercy. I was embarrassed for KITT and Michael.One man can make a difference turned into a herd.The only reason I'll buy this season is that I like to have complete sets, even if I don't watch them.alfuso"
5,classic tv on DVD,Just Getting a replacement for some damaged disks from when i first got them from Best Buy a long time ago
5,Knight Rider Season Two,This is the third of this series and is as good as the rest. It's different than whats on tv now.
5,Knight Rider season four,this is a great series. I especially liked David Hasselhoff Who played Michael Knight and i especially liked his T-Top car Kitt. I give Knight Rider season four 5 star rating and I would definatly recommend it to my family & friends. I received This DVD in good condition & it met all of my expectations!
1,Garbage,"This video is an absolute waste of money--flush your money down the toilet instead. Poor video quality, with less than 30 minutes devoted to the Apollo 13 flight. The rest of the video is even worse. Probably the worst documentary I've ever had the displeasure of watching."
4,Good introduction into applying Jungian Psychology,"This book by marie-Luise Von Franz provides valuable insight into the varied uses of a Jungain approach to psychology. Interpreting fairy tales provides us with skills and techniques to help interpret our own fairy tales, that of our dreams and life stories. Useful for all students of Jung and applicable in our own lives if only for the joy of seeking connections and associations in our own experiences. Ideal for dreamers and philosophers as well as beginner Jungians."
5,This is what I've been looking for...,"For an administrator you can hold the GUI. To replace NT File/Print servers, I needed the basics on the superior Linux OS. I looked through dozens of ""quick Linux"" types. They all focussed on installation, GUI or StarOffice -- useless to an admin.This book got right to the basics of what I really needed. No it doesn't give you GNOME or KDE. That's not what the title or preview implies.Although this is a ""For Dummies"" and I'm a supposedly high and mighty MCSE, I'm keeping it in my cubicle even after I finish the last page."
2,Don't be a Dummy,"Very general like most of the Dummies books I have read. This covers the topics that are in most of the Linux books on the market, but doesn't go into the depth you need. If you buy this be aware it won't be the last Linux admin book that you will spend money on."
1,wrong part,I ordered this part for a 2002 Honda Accord. The Amazon listing said this was the right part. WRONG! This part WILL NOT fit a 2002 Honda Accord. I'm sure the part is fine but Amazon needs to make sure their listing of application is correct!
4,Useful Writer's Resource,"Summary:Very easy to use. Useful in writing personal poems, and creating good phonics for other writings.Structure:1.....Divided by vowel sounds2.....Sub-divided by vowel-consonant soundsReview:This structure makes it easy for me to look up sounds and related words."
5,The best kept secret in latin Rap... A most buy!,This is one the best albums i have ever heard. Thello is the best young composer of this times....
1,Dont Believe The Wuthof Name,"I purchased this item on sale, and when it arrived, I was surprised to find that the block was completely split in two from top to bottom. The entire block looked very poorly made, and I was very disappointed in its quality. It really looked like the pieces of the block were glued together. Thankfully I can return it and will be buying the Henckels Knife Block as a a replacement. I really expected more from the Wusthof name, as they make wonderful knives, but their blocks leave something to be desired...Heres an image of the broken blockhttp...."
3,It's worth the money,"This is the set (block and steel) that some stores offer for free when you purchase $100 or more worth of Wusthof products. I have not seen them for sale seperately anywhere else. It's a wood block that will be perfect to start a collection with. It's got the logo that will show off your Wusthof preference. It's a bit bulky and doesn't go up as much as it goes forward. If you have enough counter space this will be perfect, it takes quite a bit of space on my counter."
2,poor made block,Yes the this item is poorly made the block is !!! I was going to give it as a gift but I am not going to give a block of wood slapped together for money!!! the 2 stars are for the steel!
3,"Nothing fantastic, but if you need it, get it","The steel is very nice. I only bought this block and steel because the price was Cheeeeep. It looks ok, and works fine if you are slowly building up a collection of Wusthof knives. Some reviewers thought the block looked lousy, but I thought it was fine. It does take up a bit more horizontal space than some better blocks I have seen, and it would be nice if is took up more vertical space and less countertop. Its is quite narrow, however, and I felt this compensated nicely in the counter space consuming department Basically, I got this to fill out an order to qualify for free shipping and it was basically free, so I cant complain. It is functional if not terribly exciting, and as I said, it is the knives you fill the block with that matter."
2,"poor quality, poor design","Block is pretty basic. Not very attractive and seems pretty cheap in quality. But the worst part for me is that the knife slots are not very thick. I guess it is made for ultra poor knifes, because only one of the slots can take my good chef knife (Henckels five star), and I have other similar knifes that wouldn't fit. So... a block that can hold only one quality knife is a worthless paperweight. I ended up giving it away."
4,Sarcasm is not good review,"Mr. Reiss's review down there is not to be taken seriously, as you can see by the way he writes. Sarcasm is not a good way to review a book. Especially when you are terribly unknowledgeable about a subject.There are many books dealing with a pre-Columbus European presence in the Americas. Barry Fell is a prime example. You can interpret the evidence in many ways, but the fact is that the evidence is there. Even for large naval groups. Not navel (belly button) forces.This book is a good introduction to the material, but someone who has more interest in the subject matter might want to look up Barry Fell."
2,"im sorry, this is just not funny","The ""no a*s at all"" rap at the beginning was about the last time I laughed out loud. But I just didnt dig this stand up. I was expecting real dry, smart sense of humor. But when she was imitating people and groaning and moaning all loud, it wasnt good. Her material and delivery is just not that funny. Even the audience never went hysterical. And you know why? Because she was not that funny. She talked about porn, marriage, being tall, exercise, drinking, masturbating, being (kind of) black, etc. I smiled a few times. Maybe she's just not my sense of humor (I really like Lisa Lampanelli, Louis CK, Kevin Hart, Brian Regan, Dane Cook, Dmitri Martin, Jaime Foxx, Chapelle). So if you kind of like those people, then you might not find this that funny. Aisha Tyler is beautiful but this was a disappointment.EDIT: Hmmmmm (as of review editing time) $1.50 for this DVD used. People must *really* want to hold onto their copies."
3,Aisha is hella cool,"She is so funny, me and my wife loved this. I dont know whats up with the audio though, poor quality, but worth it to experience her live!"
5,Aisha is wonderful!!!,"I pre-ordered this a few weeks ago and it arrived this past weekend and it's as good as I expected. Like many people,I first watched her on Talk Soup and seeing her here is even better minus the censors and time restrictions. This Beautiful and Smart lady is a joy to watch and you should buy this...RIGHT NOW!"
1,minutes of my life wasted....,"I was looking forward to Aisha. However, I wasn't good and settled on my couch before her music video comes on. It wasnt funny and it dragged on painfully long...we get it..u have no booty..so what.Her comedic timing was off. Her jokes weren't funny. She needs to learn the art of the pause. But most importantly, she needs to stop writing her own material. It was bad.Unless you already know her work and you are a committed fan I suggest you not buy this. Theres a reason a used copy can be bought for a dollar and some change."
1,Don't waste your time,"With the annoying video in the beginning, this thing was pretty bad. She is nice to look at but that's about it. She is not funny and was actually pretty corny."
2,Remastered?,"After comparing this to the original 1988 CD I am not convinced that it is remastered. The liner notes mention that it is remastered by a person who did not work on the original but if it is remastered it is a half-assed effort, as I mentioned earlier, I cannot discern any noticeable difference in the two. Another waste of my money, as was the recent reissue of Modern English's ""Ricochet Days""."
4,Short and sweet,"This is a good book for lower level readers. Also kids who are intimidated by longer books. Also good for higher level readers in earlier grades, 2nd to 3rd, for example. Very accessible telling of Rachel's life, the author blends well the details of her personal life with her professional life, weaves a good story. Quite poetic in parts, disadvantaged, introspective or nature loving kids may find it inspiring. The only gripe I have is that it is a little short on details, but for some kids, less is more."
1,"Warning, don't buy! Buy Cisco press instead!","If you use this book alone you will fail! I have passed 7 certification exams and never failed one until now, by one question! Book mentions next to nothing about SAINT, SAGE, SAMBA, and Phoenix ASICs. Chapters on 1900/2820 and 3000 appear to be written by a different author who is less qualified with both Cisco switches and technical writing! Book does not clearly cover the stated Cisco objectives! Technical Inaccuracies throughout the book! The questions at the end of the chapters are way too easy! The questions on the CD are the same as in the book! Why did I buy this book? Buy the Cisco press book, it has none of these shortcomings! Buy the way, anyone want to buy this book from me - cheap?"
2,How to hide a few thing,"Like most Paladin books, this slim volume is serioulsy lacking in substance. If you want advice on how to hide some jewelry or your stash around the house, then this book will do it for you. Otherwise, this rather dated edition will leave you in the dark. Save your money. Do some web searches and you will probably come up with more complete and up-to-date information for only your time."
3,"Some good ideas, but there could have been more","This guide has some interesting ideas for hiding places (false pipes in the bathroom, the bottom of a pot of food, etc) as well as tried-and-true favorites (hollowed-out books, false-bottom drawers). There are also some fun ideas for hiding people in hidden rooms and floors.Although there are tons of pictures, some of the descriptions may be a difficult for a person who is not familiar with construction. A few extra diagrams might have helped.In general, it's a quick and easy read and is sure to get your imagination going. I especially enjoyed the author's emphasis on hiding things in plain sight. If anything, this guide will get you to think about everyday items and places as potential hiding places.[Disclosure: This review also appears on [...], a site for review and discussion of creative works.]"
1,Not what I expected,"OK, so I thought it would be a good starter book to get ideas on how to hide my stuff, it was not.Poorly written, the drawings looked to be sketched by hand, (which is OK providing you can make-out the details), and it generally lacked impact.With a couple of exceptions, I think every location idea that Mr. Connor shows are impractical. Seriously, what can you really hide inside of a hollowed out table leg? A document or two, or drugs maybe. And the idea of hollowing out a tree trunk from the bottom up? How do you descreetly get to your stuff?Don"
3,How To Hide Anything,Good book (3 out of 5).Some general ideas about where to hide things. More details and mechanism drawings would be appreciated.
5,Excellent Book,"I highly recommend this book. It goes into great detail on how to hide small things as well as large objects and personnel. It's well worth the price, trust me!"
4,Good academic text,"This is one of the best scholarly treatments of the history of technology in the United States. The work is well researched, and represents the result of a career-long effort by the author to come up with a lively history of something--technology--that sits at the heart of the American experience.It is very disappointing to see reviews like the one submited under the first customer review. It reveals a lack of a strong culture of reading, and both understanding and appreciation for authors (and scholars) and the work that they do."
4,Beautiful Read,A beautiful book for anyone who wants a broader understanding of Zen... whether historical or practical tips on the benefits in modern day life... a lovely read...
3,not represented correctly,"there were pages missing - the entire front section. I think someone started scouts and then quit. But, the description didn't mention this."
4,Operatic illusions,"Opera comes from the Kruder + Dorfmeister school music - downbeat, jazzy, ambient dub. The album is gritty and jagged, although it is put together with vocal interludes enabling the listener to digest the music. Gimmi Gimmi and Chocolate Elvis are standout tracks."
4,Very nice but not what was pictured.,I enjoyed the product but I was disappointed when I didn't get the same five that were pictured. I feel like the ones pictured should be what you receive but otherwise I liked them.
2,No pin backs!!,"We were really pleased with the ""pins"" and the pictures on them, until we turned them over & realized there are no pin backs on any of them! So they're great as little whatever-they-ares, but pins/buttons they are not!!"
3,Good introduction to composers,"Articles are usually 2-3 pages in length, sometimes including a little know fact. Use this for a brief introduction to a well-known composer. Suitable for all grades as a starting point, depending on level of students' previous knowledge"
4,Worth the Money!,"Definitely worth the money. I take it twice a day: immediately after workouts and 6-8 hours later like the suggested serving calls for. Felt results in a bout a week, bigger & stronger muscles and a little more endurance."
5,Great Tea,"Adagio herbal teas are some of the highest quality and best tasting products in existence. The Sour Apple is probably the one that is least like its name but is tasty nonetheless. Pina Colada, Berry Blast, Blood Orange, Dewey Cherry, Mango Melange and Berry Blues all live up to their names and are simply delicious."
5,Fixed my feet,"After many years of foot issues, I had gone through several different, very expensive trials of custom-made inserts, cushioned and supportive shoes, daily exercises, etc. I read this book (very quick read), did what he said--including gradually going barefoot, which was against all the advice I had received elsewhere--and was stunned to discover that my feet, after almost 50 years of over-correction, were fine--they just needed to be strengthened--because they had been coddled for years! Following Maffetone's advice made my feet strong. I remember getting a foot massage from my husband after several months on the Maffetone protocol, and he told me my feet had gone from shark cartilage (no support, no muscle) to feeling like real feet. I used to only be able to wear extremely specific shoes, couldn't stand for very long, and couldn't walk without pain. That is all behind me, and it's been about four years of bliss. Thank you, Philip Maffetone! P.S. I am barefoot as I write this!"
2,fix your feet,the book is definitely not worth the price. It spends too much time on less relevant issues and very little time on how to actually fix your feet. The whole book boils down to just go barefoot and everything else was primarily to fill in the pages so that a book could be sold!!! This book should be a free brochure given out with barefoot shoes and or injinji socks or something. At most a 5 page summary of talking points would suffice.
2,Don't make this your only reference,"I had this book and the Transcender exam for Exchange 5.5. It's a good thing I had the Transcender stuff. I've been working with Exchange for over a year in single-site configurations, but needed something to get wise to multi-site configurations, etc. This book wasn't enough. Maybe it was just the fact that I kept falling asleep over it, but there seemed to be major sections that the Transcender exam covered well that this didn't touch at all. All in all, a disappointment."
3,"Easy to follow, but not practical for the exam","I just finished my Exchange Server 5.5 exam, using this book to study from. While the book itself is not a bad read, and is great about showing you step-by-step how to navigate Exchange itself, the end-of-chapter review questions were completely irrelevant for the exam. Spend more time with the Case Projects problems, and that will give you more of an idea how the adaptive exam is."
1,Didn't Like!,I did not like this product at all. I gave this to my older daughter and let her use it... Very small as well...
3,Doesn't stay on,"This stays on my lips for about 5 minutes before I need to reapply, and the tube isn't very big. The price is good, but I wouldn't buy it again. If you are looking for a good clear gloss, I'd recommend Victoria's Secret Beauty Rush, which stays on for a very long time. I'd also recommend the Mentha kind, which has a great mint smell."
3,The mystery of the foundling,"First published in French in 1983 as Le fils d'Astérix, and in English the same year.Asterix and Obelix must deal with the strange phenomenon of a baby boy, dropped on Asterix' doorstep.This is one particular challenge they have not dealt with before.While we puzzle over the mystery of the baby's birth, the villainous, power-hungry, Brutus is hell-bent on getting his hands on the child, whatever it takes.Meanwhile the cherub-like baby accidentally ingests some magic potion, which gives him super-human strength and a terror to whoever tries to interfere with him.Not one of the best Asterix albums, but still worth adding to your collection."
5,Value doesn't end,"This is a great antenna, but that is just the beginning. Troubleshooting antenna problems requires experience, and Winegard stands behind their products with outstanding support. I bought the SS-1000 but was still having problems receiving one channel. I contacted Winegard for advice. The Service Manager responded to me email and gave me his direct phone. After troubleshooting the antenna placement with his advice, everything is working very well. I had heard good things about the antenna, but never expected such great support."
1,Do Not Buy This Blender,"Ours held our for about eight months of once-a-week use making smoothies. Judging from other reviews here, that was longer than many others. I expected much better from Cuisinart. That start does not shine as brightly now."
1,Poor quality and poor parts!,"I registered and received this blender as a wedding gift. I thought I was getting a steal since it also came with another food processing unit that you could swap out on top for the blender so I was very excited. I am by no means a heavy blender user. I would say that perhaps I have used it on average two times a month for the past 3 years. About 2 months ago, I go to put on the food processor top and it makes this horrible high pitched squealing sound. I think I may have lost some hearing from how horrible it was. Two people within my household came running out of their respective rooms to see what the ""horrible noise"" was. I picked up the base, and sure enough like many others on here - the drive had stripped the gripping teeth practically flat. The next day I tried the blender top, which worked fine until I went to pour it and it started leaking out from in between the white plastic ring to where it connects to the glass.This thing is a piece of junk!"
1,Poorly designed.,"Read other reviews. The drive on this unit fails. I probably used this blender only around 10 times over the past year, and now its broken.Do not buy."
