2,not funny,"This would have been a been a better book if it were funny.As it stands it is a really, really bad book.The authors blow every single punch line by over-explaining the joke...too careful about losing someone.For the love of all things dear to you, do not buy this."
5,"""I Hate This Place""--I love this book","I Hate This Place is a great book--funny and very clever. It includes all those things we (well, most of us) often think of but can never actually put into words (especially not this witty). I've often thought of myself as an optimist but after reading this book, I have to say that I'm probably not. Jimmy and Gloria Fallon (whom I got to meet at a book signing--very cool) are two ingenious and unique people who aren't afraid to tell it like it is. Highly recommended!"
5,Hi Mom,"I have burned all my other books just to make room for this one on the shelf. Hey wait, it's not as big as I thought, I didn't have to burn all my books? doooooo"
3,Wanna-be Deep Thoughts,"It's like reading borderline funny Deep Thoughts. Skip this book, order Deep Thoughts and Deeper Thoughts, and catch Jimmy on SNL."
5,BEST BOOK IN THE WORLD,"I absolutly loved this book, I mean meeting Jimmy and talking to him was the best. He is so nice in person!!!!! The book was very funny!!"
3,Pessimism personified!,"Fun and cute, clever and ironic, and ALWAYS pessimistic, ""I Hate This Place"" dares to reveal the dark side that lurks within all of us. The Pessimist doesn't care if you've ruined dinner or forgotten your umbrella in the downpour of the century, so long as he can tell you about his even WORSE day. Jimmy and Gloria Fallon have taken a humorously fresh approach to the conventions of the self-help genre and created a quick read that any person alive on this planet can relate to. Go on, be a pessimist!"
1,New definition to the word bad,"I was going to give this one half a star, but you can't do that. These people aren't pessimists, it's just 122 pages of these people bitching! Not even funny bitching either. Although, the 'going to the family reunion,' thing did earn them half a star. The other half simply came from the fact that I didn't want to admit to buying a copletely crummy book"
2,"Huge Jimmy fan, but disapointed with the book","When I realized that my favorite cast member on SNL had written a book, I ordered it right away. I guess I didn't do my research because I really thought that it would be longer or funnier or something. While I found a few pieces of advice funny like going to a laundromat to meet people, the majority of the book was not entertaining. The book got boring and stale very quickly, and it seemed that the majority of it was about the possibility of an untimely death. I truly am a huge Jimmy Fallon fan, and I would have liked to give this book a good review. The idea for the book was good, but they just ran out of ideas for fresh and interesting passages very quickly. I won't disregard any ventures that Jimmy or Gloria may make into writing again, but I will do my research. Maybe I just had to high of expectations for such a wonderful and gifted comedian."
5,LOVE IT!!!!,"This is an awesome book! A lot of the pages of really funny!! Jimmy and Gloria did an awesome job writing it and I think one of the reasons it's done so well is because people can relate to the things they say in the book. I love Jimmy, he's hilarious on SNL and he continues that comedy into the book. His sister also did a great job writing it. Also, check out Jimmy's CD, The Bathroom Wall. It's awesome, I love it!!!"
4,"Good entrance, okay performance","Zen Gardening hits it off strong; Harte puts forth traditional ideas with a not-so-subtle twist - straying away from mystic mumbo-jumbo, opting for the vernacular of the everyday joe. Following many Japanese and Chinese organizational techniques, the author presents simple additions and mods to almost any abode as well as full and luscious decked-out, fully landscaped projects. Some far fetched, and some less so, all are very pleasing to the eye. The illustration and photography in this book are superb. This is a good book to dwell on; pragmatic applications are not this book's strong points."
3,"Nice book, old pictures","This book was pretty well written and emphasizes the important aspects of zen gardening but I feel that the pictures are old and dated, this book was first published in 1999 but I think the pictures are from the 70's??? I usually look at images in a book or magazine for insperations but I didn't get much from this one. If you are looking for contemporary or modern or current ""zen gardening"", then this book may not be for you."
4,Warming up.,"This album has its strong moments, and its weak moments. Its strongest is ""Glow Worm/Waveform"", and Its weakest is ""A Warning From The Sun""This album has a very odd feel to it, and I am sure that it is intentional. The electronics of all match the time of year exceptionally well. Coil manages to pull it off indescribably well. Spring's electronics feel renewing, starting, and building up. Summers's feel hazy, warm, sharp, and almost bright. Autumn's feel retrospective, aged, mature, aware, ending. Winter's feel cold, seperate, transcendetal, almost like ""afterlife"". This is something only Coil could do without looking pretentious. The only greater example might be their ""Angelic Conversation"" soundtrack."
1,Disappointed,"I was so disappointed in this book. The chapters sounded so interesting. The photos were good, but the writing was so dull. I tried several chapters and found them all to be just blah, blah, blah. I love this period and have several books about the Elizabethan era, but this book did not have one page I found interesting. I am returning the book."
3,Thorough book but cheap glue,Let me first make it clear that I like this book. It is well structured and very good for the Illustrator newcomer. It touches almost all areas that you can use Illustrator for through short examples complete with illustrative pictures. Chris Botello has done a good job on this book and that is why I got so upset when it started to fall apart just one week after I first opened it! The glue that holds it all together just dried up and now I have a cover filled with loose pages!If that hadn't happened I'd give this book a 4 but now it is more of a weak 3.
2,dispointed,The book is very easy to read and understand. But since the books is old you can't download the supporting files at the web site mentioned on the book. Don't buy this book get the newer version!!
2,Pedagogically challenged,"I did get a few useful bits of information from reading this volume, but that's my point: it's organized as units of information unrelated to the real world that Illustrator is used in.This is NOT a plug for the 'Real-World' series, which, as a reference manual, isn't a tutorial or workbook. The revealed series is marketed as a workbook-style book, & occasionally lives up to it, but all too occasionally. Were I a novice, I don't believe I would have a coherent grasp of Illustrator as a whole, just unrelated bits of technique."
3,"Functional, but poorly constructed","This is a great book in it's color version only (if you're in a class or comfortable with illustration programs). But, don't bother with the B&W; versionAdobe Illustrator CS2 Revealed. While it doesn't matter that you don't get the CD, since you can download all the files from a source they provide you, it DOES matter if you can't keep the book together. It has pages falling out of it from the first time you open the book. Spend the extra money on the color version with the CD, the binding is much better."
1,Pages coming out,"I am not very satisfied with my purchase because the book it's brand new, and just take it to college once a week and I am very careful with it, now the pages are coming out of the book. It's like the glue used to put the book together is gone and the book is falling apart. I would like that you check that, I had the book with me and don't even take it to school anymore because of that problem.Thank you for your time.Gueorgui Smaguin Ibanez"
3,Self Destructing Book,Go ahead and buy if you like throwing your money out the window. The pages fall out of the book as you read. Images are all B&W.
1,bad binding / no CD!!,"This was a required course book for school and it is not advertised that this is not in color and that it doesn't contain the tutorial CD necessary to follow the book. I am severely dissapointed. The binding broke right away... bad glue?? I had to punch holes in it and put it in a binder...just like handouts. Ridiculous. It had been advertised as ""new"" and I am not satisfied with the product. The book is actually good."
2,Adobe Illustrator CS2 Revealed,"My book had absolutley NO color images. My classmates books were all in color. The pages are falling out of the book, and it obviously a poor imitation of the real thing!!! Very disappointed."
1,WTH???,"A car seat is for protecting your child who is NOT BIG ENOUGH to sit in a regular seat (57"" tall and 80 lbs.). This seat does not provide ANY protection at all for a child in a car! If your child was in this ""SEAT"" and you were in an automobile accident they would NOT BE PROTECTED from INJURY OR DEATH! I guess if you are willing to risk your child's life for a little 'convenience' this would be a good purchase. i hope people will think twice before purchasing this."
3,Fair product for inexpensive price,I have a 13 month old child. This seat was excellent for the taxi ride (20-30mins) to/from the airport. I would not use it for long trips in my car b/c it didn't ever feel tight enough for long enough where a bump on the road or a wiggling little boy couldn't get it dangerously loose. It might have just been my kind of car b/c it seemed tighter in the taxi. You can't use it on the plane either. I was happy that it was small and portable. It fit in the front pocket of my suitcase. I'll definitely take it to NYC with me for short taxi rides there. I am amazed that it passes all the safety regulations for a legitimate car seat!
2,well... um... maybe... in a REAL TIGHT PINCH,"offers no support for sleeping kids... doesn't fit kids past age 3 in most cases (low top slots, cannot be used once shoulders go over the top slots)... and kids under 2yo are MUCH safer rearfacing... Basically it MIGHT fit a 3yo & work fine for a short trip w/ grandma. It is also a real pain to install.The Ride Safer Travel Vest is a much more secure option that fits older kids & is very compact. Comparable to a 5pt harness too!For babies a Cosco Scenera is a much better option for a second or spare seat.. atleast it fits kids from birth to about age 3 all for about 40 bucks.The EB Portable is just a waste."
2,don't buy for $359.89,Has anyone bought the car seat for $359.89??? I hope not!This car seat is not that great. The seat belt slides off/out.
1,Price-Jacked,"I had this saved in my shopping cart at $59. Then when I went to purchase it, it had been jacked to $129. I'm not sure why, but it's definitely NOT worth anything over $100. I might as well throw in some extra money and get the portable Safeguard go hybrid booster for $199, or just lug my big ole' car seat on the plane at no cost. It's a safer and cheaper option."
4,Good for travel for 1 and 2 year olds,"I purchased this car seat for my son when he was 2. It is fine for tour buses etc. It is not meant to be a primary car seat. It is meant to be a car seat for the little ones when there would otherwise be no carseat available.At 2 1/2, my son was close to the size limit for the car seat. So, my recommendation would be to purchase it if you are touring with a one or two year old. A small 3 year old would fit as well."
3,Fits your typical 2-3 year olds,"I was pleasantly surprised with this portable car seat. If your child is within 30lbs and not overly active, this product will work great. I found a shortcoming in the quality of the plastic clasps used to bring the belts together across the chest. Would like to see a version for 3 - 5 year olds."
2,Very scary!,"I bought this car seat in anticipation of traveling with my toddler. VERY SCARY is all I can say. It was great to use on the plane, but I would not use it again in the car. It does not support the child, my child is 12 months and he was fall over when he fell asleep. I may be better suited for an older toddler. My husband had to sit in the back seat to make sure our son did not lean too much to the side. My thoughts, Take a real car seat, and get a travel bag to carry it in. I will not be using this product in the car anymore only on the plane."
2,Not as expected,Bought it because I have 3 kids and a small car (Honda Civic). Car Seat is the desireable size I needed but it doesn't hold well in the seat. The back has no support at all and if your kid moves a lot he/she will mvoe it off it's place. Only recommemd for emergency use only. I ended up buying an Expedition after 2 weeks of use.
3,TERRIBLY OVERPRICED,"This car seat is not very comfortable for your child unless someone is sitting next to them to ensure they don't fall over; even when installed properly. It is however, very convennient for carpooling or traveling because it's so small that it fits in your luggage. the big problem I see here is that I purchased it a few months ago through Amazon for $34.99, shipping included, and now it's $150. That's ridiculous!!!"
1,PLEASE DONT BUY!!!!,"I bought this for my 15 month old daughter who spent the week of our vacation sooooo uncomfortable and her mother spent the week being nervous about her saftey. Despite reading the directions several times and many readjustments I was never happy with its placement, it moved way more than I was comfortable with. The idea is great and it fit nicely in the front of my suitcase but I will never use it again and would never recommend it to anyone."
1,Better product out there...but pricey,I tried this seat and ultimately returned it. Difficult to install properly and not comfortable for my child. I bought a safeguard go seat and it is awesome and very secure. It's pricey but worth it if you need a seat that can travel fairly easilty.
2,NOT SAFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was planning for a family vacation for my family and loved the convienance of these car seats that they could be packed in a regular suitcase so I ordered 3 for my 22 month old triplets. I wanted to use them for vacation and as a second set of car seats for my husbands truck. After using them on vacation, I returned them. I ended up having to sit in the back of the Suburban and was constantly readjusting seats and children as we drove. True they were convenient for travel, but not safe. I would much rather have my children safe."
4,Good emergency car seat,"I purchased this car seat because we were travelling in Florida. I knew we would be taking a cab to and from the airport and renting a car for one day. I didn't wanted to lug my 2 year olds big car seat around when we wouldn't even have a car most of the time. This car seat worked out fine. Just make sure you adjust the straps way before you use it in the car. It's difficult to adjust in a hurry. During wake time it was great. She was securely strapped in and comfortable. It is good for short trips but don't use it for long rides. It is terrible for sleeping in. The baby had nowhere to lay her head. All in all, it served its purpose for our vacation. We will use it again."
2,Not easy to use,"I got this carseat to use on our vacation. We went on a cruise and I knew we would be in shuttles and taxis a lot so I wanted something easy to carry around and safe for my child. However it was not easy to install at all, so we never used it. It had so many variations on how to install it with different types of seatbelts that it would have taken forever while we were sitting in the taxi to read the instructions for each one and figure out how to install it correctly. Plus you had to remove the fabric on the front to intall the seatbelt and uninstall it each time."
3,Eddie Bauer Poratble car seat,"It's a Ok product for when you travel, but do not use instead of a regular car seat, the regular ones offer a lot more protection!"
5,Excellent skill building book,"I'll preface this by saying that I am an experienced wood worker (I didn't say I was good, though). I am proficient with most of the big tools you would find in a well stocked shop. I am new, however, to the scroll saw. This book is just as described: ""Scroll Saw Workbook: Learn to Use Your Scroll Saw in 25 Skill-Building Chapters"". For the most part, it doesn't give you step by step instructions on building spectacular projects. What it DOES give you, though, is step by step lessons on how to learn how to build a spectacular project. It covers techniques that I never would have thought of. I wish I had books like this for my table saw, band saw, etc., etc. This is a very good book for learning the skills needed for proficient use of the scroll saw."
2,instruction lacking,"Although this is a decent book for beginners and I like the concept of progressive exercises, I found the instruction to be lacking. How do I handle grain? What are the best blade and feed speeds for what thicknesses and species of wood? There is much more and better advice given in The New Scroll Saw Handbook by Patrick Spielman. I would advise to buy it first and read it cover to cover and then if you want the progressive exercises buy this workbook."
5,Excellent workbook on scroll saws,"I've wanted to learn how to use a scroll saw and I wasn't sure what to look for or how hard it would be to use. I don't have one yet but wanted to find out all that I could before I puchase one. I actually checked this book out at the library first to see if it would be worth while to buy it, and I haven't been able to set it down. My dad is pretty good in woodworking and I showed him this book and he agreed that it is a really good instructional book. The author makes you feel confident in doing the exercises. He also explains about the different scroll saws and what to look for in a scroll saw. It also explains the different types of blades, wood, and material that can be used. Then it gives different exercises to do, starting with the beginner and if you make a mistake the different ways to fix it. I will definately buy this book, it will be an excellent reference."
4,New to Scroll Sawing?,When I ordered this book I was fairly new to using a scroll saw. It provides the reader with chapters of projects to cut to increase your skills as you go. It starts out with basic projects and works it's way to more complicated subjects. My only dislike was that there needs to be more basic projects as I am truly a newby when it comes to a scroll saw.
5,Great Beginner Book,I really love this little book. Excellent for beginner Scroll Saw users.Very easy to understand with lots of helpful illustrations and photographs.I would definately recommend this book for anyone who wants to get into Scroll Saw crafts.
5,Great book!,"I am brand new to scrolling, and this book was a great learning tool for learning a variety of skills through different projects. The variety of projects is just great! I still need lots of practice, but that just takes time. I am about 3/4 through the book and would highly recommend it."
4,The only reason it doesn't get five stars..,"Is because of the misleading book design -That is, that the cover photos show the book as if done in a ""lay flat"" spiral design, when actually it's a fake-out piece of artwork on the cover. I know this sound's too picky, but many times the selling point for an instruction book is the ability to lay flat on the bench to allow for easier hands-on instruction.All else considered, John Nelson is well known and respected for his imaginative scroll saw designs, and the book is very concise and would be a help to anyone."
4,Excellent book for beginner to scroll sawing,This is an excellent book for a beginner with the scroll saw. It has a great introduction and excellent exercises.
4,Good introduction to scrolling.,The book contained good example patterns to explain what I should be doing. The book's intended audience is the novice.
5,A Tongue In Cheek insider's guide,"I was given this book as a gift and wasn't sure what type of book it was at first. After the first chapter, I found myself engrossed in this world of garage sales and estate sales. I never realized such a huge subculture exists as is illustrated in the book. The self narrating style of writing made the tone light hearted and more realistic. It was as if I was there with Mr. Horist and his acrapulating adventures. The clever illustrations protray the acrapulating ""spirit"" and ""drive"" even more. Not a serious book but if you are into a light hearted read but with good content, this is a must. Excellent gag gift for collector friends.In the spirit of Acrapulating, this book is now with another friend who loves to Acrapulate.Highly recommended!"
3,An unnecesary extra but fun!,"When we first bought this product we didn't have a game to link into (though being new to the system, we quickly found out). We did get games for a birthday and Christmas that link up and it was great. My son is the only one who has used it so far but he enjoys it."
4,More than enough,"Hi, I have a Gamecube and I Want alot of things for it. My favorite game is Animal Crossing, but I am always bored. So I went and purchased this at Toysrus. Now I love to visit islands on it. Thanxs to the Nintendo GameCube/ Game Boy Advance cable it helps me unlock new levels. Thanxs"
1,this is junk,okay my son tried to transfer chao so i bought it it said error so then i got a gamecube then still error so i got 1 more still error then i tried every thing buying old gba so its junk
1,"NOT Nintendo Product, barely fits GBA SP","Please be advised that the item being shipped is NOT an original Nintendo product. The connector ""fits"" into the GBA SP, but it is too wide: if you insert it all the way it presses the buttons in. It does work, but you have to be careful to keep the cable just right. This probably wouldn't be a problem for regular GBA"
1,Shame on Amazon and Hitgaming (Springledge Entertainment),"Pros:-Available for PRIME shipping-Amazon will have UPS come pick-up re-order so I don't have to drive to UPS again.Cons:-Amazon should allow a reviewer to give ""zero"" stars.-Not ""by Nintendo"" as stated-Cheap generic cable-Ordered 1st cable and complained that it was generic cable and was told to re-order and ship back incorrect/generic cable (waste of MY time and gas)-Reordered when told by online chat rep (exact quote) ""It doesn't happen normally. You'll get the right product this time.""-Received the same cheap generic cable for 2nd order.-Contacted Amazon and at first they tried to blame on seller, but I pointed out that it was fulfilled by Amazon, so Amazon should make sure that they are provided with quality goods to ship."
1,generic cables,"don't buy it expecting these cables to be the ones shown in the image, they are from a generic brand and don't work for pokemon games."
2,Update of Corman Classic Has Few Moments,"This remake of ""A Bucket of Blood,"" put in a modern 90s setting this time, is stylish and colorful but lacks the pacing and black humor that made the original such a classic. The casting is okay but the direction given to Anthony Michael Hall as Walter Paisley and Justine Bateman as love interest Carla leaves alot to be desired. What made Dick Miller's performance in the original work was the quirky charm and naivete he carried even as he descended into murder. Hall's Walter comes off as a dumb, malevolent jerk in grungewear. Turning the character of Carla into an aloof Italian Eurotrash fashion victim was also a bad move. None of the characters capture attention or sympathy except maybe in the pivotal part where a haughty loudmouth model pisses Walter off and sets the stage for his murderous art. At 85 minutes, it is almost twenty minutes longer than the original and it shows. Not bad, but not great either."
3,Bizarre cast in sleeper cult film,"Oddly enough, Anthony Michael Hall gives his best performance ever...Actually, at some points, you feel sad for him...The cast is VERY eclectic, including Justine Bateman (who's funny as the Eurotrash artist!), Shadoe Stevens, Mink Stole, Paul Bartel, yada yada...but it's not that bad...And it does make fun of the ""art world"" really well...Great fun."
1,No sirven estos libros,"Libros como estos y lo mucho que se venden hacen que los verdaderos escritores y verdaderos lectores se hundan en una terrible mediocridad. ¿por que?Por que son terribles historias mal escritas dirigidas al tipo de publico que aprecia cualquier basofia. lo que deberia suceder es que este publico por si solo, aprenda a leer cosas mas complicadas para asi tener un criterio mas amplio y aprender un poco de la vida.Tengan un poco de respeto hacia su inteligencia, y lean a Juan Rulfo, Julio Cortazar o Vargas Llosa."
5,Review by Marci Elliot - Award winning journalist/columnist,"This is not a book. It is a gateway into the mind and heart of k.t. Frankovich -- and to everyone who has known pain and and struggling of the environment and of the spirit. k.t. Frankovich was blessed with special gifts, indeed, and one of them is knowing how to link with people everywhere who have suffered, overcome and rejoiced. If you are one of these people, you will not be able to put this down. And you will want to keep the gateway to k.t. Frankovich opened.Marci ElliottAward-winning journalist, columnist/senior writer The Daily Commercial newspaper & Womans Quarterly magazine (Quarterly supplement The Daily Commercial)] Central Florida"
4,Woth the trouble to obtain a better print,"I really ordered this title in order to acquire a better print of ""Shoot to Kill"" than I had previously enoyed on Alpha Video, and I was not disappointed. Picture quality and sound were noticeably improved in the VCI version. The movie itself poses an intriguing question in the very opening scene: What were the district attorney, his wife, and a sought-after felon all doing in the same car wreck in which all were killed? The plot keeps you guessing about the answer until the very end. It packed a lot of entertainment into a little over an hour's running time."
3,Best Diet Ever!,"I needed to catch up on my reading goal. This book was available at the BookCrossing meeting today. So I grabbed it. I yelled at the two sweet little girls who wanted it, to get away, it was mine. But they called me 'Miss Bossy Pants.' Actually, that last part about the girls was a stretch of the truth. Actually, when their mom told them they should read it, they decided all the other picture books were more their speed. What girls wants to think of themselves as bossy?So the pictures were cute. Mr. Wizard looked just like my dad!Now, if the hint was true, that I am, indeed, a bossy person, those boots would not only cut down on that but maybe I could lose a pound or two? Think we could invent them?BCID: 455-10435046"
5,Little Miss Bossy helps children understand.,"I read a lot of the Mr. Mand and Little Miss books when I was a kid. I am now a new teacher in a multiage 1st and 2nd grade. I bought some of these books because I love them, but also to teach my class about why they need to be nice to others and other lessons. When I bought Little Miss Bossy I was thinking about one studnet in my class. I had read a few others to the class before I read Little Miss BOssy, and the class loved the stories and could not wait to hear more. I read Little Miss Bossy, and they loved it. I talked with one of my students after about beiong nice to other people(I have done this every day all school year). I think this book helped her see what she was doing to the other kids and another reason why she needs to be kinder to others. I didn't have to talk to her about being nice to the other students for three days after I read it!"
2,a mediocre representation.,"Okey dokey, I've heard all these songs, and I can tell you here and now that this is not a very good compilation. It really doesn't do a good job of evenly representing the band--only ONE song from their pre-goth period, and the Freaks-era songs could have been better-chosen too. I'll admit they did a good job of including good material from Separations (except for the inexplicable inclusion of She's Dead, the album's worst song), but they really could have done better. If you're only going to own one early Pulp album it should be separations; if you want another, get Freaks--this isn't really worth it."
4,Very Good Ceramic Inserts,I purchased the ceramic inserts as a replacement for the same product after approximately five years. I am thoroughly satisfied with these ceramic inserts and highly recommend them.
3,Keep backed against a wall,"This bed setup was not the easiest to make with many small pieces, and clearly not high quality. But this headboard has no back-covering or paint/finish on the back, so it really looks crappy unless it's against the wall. Also, almost nothing is screwed together, but rather it's held together through a system of pegs and holes. No jumping on this bed."
2,beware of scanner software,"I haven't had this long. The amazing thing is that the scanner software doesn't support the document feeder. You can load multipages in the feeder but you must hit the scan button in the software, load up the preferences, scan one page. Then you have to do this again for each page! Then stack all the pages together to form one document in the software. Imagine if the fax part did that! It would be like faxing one page at a time! You can only find out about this by searching lexmarks or paperports knowledge base."
5,It doesn't get rawer than this,"This is a rare Cd of recordings among the Gullah culture of Johns Island, South Carolina in 1966-67. Being that the Gullah speakers were (and to a degree, still are) among the most unassimilated Black cultures of America, this gives you a chace to hear what is usually only described in books on the subject. This is thus as raw a recording on Black American culture as you can get. Janie Hunter's stories represent something of a lost art, and the Moving Hall Gospel Singers gives you actual ""Praise House"" singing stripped of all the sophistication you often hear in gospel you hear today. Civil Rights and South carolina historians will also be pleased to hear the voice of legendary civil rights leader Esau Jenkins (1910-1972) who did much to improve the life of his community and Martin Luther King's man in Charleston. Overall, a great documenary CD."
1,"Repeller ticks every 5 seconds, very annoying","I won't have the chance to find out if these work or not because the ticking is driving me crazy! It ticks about every 5 seconds. It is in my kitchen and I will have to unplug it to go to sleep, I can hear it all the way in my bedroom! Don't waste your money on this."
1,Don't Do It!!,"I bought 3 of these from Bed Bath and Beyond for around the same price as here and this was a complete waste of money.First,these are NOT silent.They give an annoying tick every few seconds.So if you have more than 1 plugged in at a time,its unbearable to be home with all the racket going on.Second,they don't work!I had a ant problem in my kitchen and these things didn't even make them flinch.I'll stick with sprays from now on."
4,"Not just philosophy, but how to design around the customer","Unlike others in the field, Wheeler and Smith lay out what you need to do to consciously design a business that consistently gives the customer an experience that lives up to their brand. In the rush to cost control, we often forget that it's easy to make life difficult for the customer, and the result is massive damage to the brand, even to the point of destroying the organization.A must read, especially in uncertain times, where the tendency will be to cut, without regard for the customer."
5,Managing The Customer Experience,This is a great read for anyone who wants to be inspired to improve the customer experience their own company provides and then wants to know how to do it. I particularly loved the stories and examples from Krispy Kreme and Pret A Manger.
3,Danish Trash Metal,"Artillery is a great unknown trash-metal band from Denmark. The music is extremely heavy and fast, very similar to Slayer but in my opinion better rhythms. The lead gutairist runs scales so fast it is hard to stay up with him, and the drumming is non-stop in your face pounding. The lyrics and singing is not the best, mostly high-pitched screams but the hard guitar rhythms make up 80% of the songs on this album. This is not the greatest metal album, but if your into fast speed metal you will enjoy it."
4,Decent,"Decent text, when combined with other sources. The text wasn't basic-enough to comprehend on first read, but after reading through other texts I understand what the author was conveying. I'll keep it as a reference."
1,Good in principle,First of all the item is too small. it is about 1/3 the lenght of a pair pants and 1/3 as wide. So as you can see it is pretty small. So it is a lot of moving around and adjusting which causes previously ironed parts to become wrinkled again.It does not make life easier. good in principle but does not work.
2,It would be great for doll clothes,I thought this thing was the size of an ironing board...its barely bigger than an iron. I spent twenty minutes trying to press a pair of pants...with only marginal results. Its interesting that in their picture they show nothing that would give you any kind of scale...a shirt a pair of pants?Very deceptive and not worth the purchase. I returned my the next day.I'm sure it could have some applications and the quality of the construction was fine...it's just way to small.
4,Replacement update,"Received SteamFast SP-660 to replace 8 year old, slightly larger, steam press. On/off switch is improvement. 3 weeks of use has not found the final press result similar to older model of EuroPro but satisfactory. Remain able to finish laundry ironing under 1 hour for the week!! Do not use hand iron anymore.KARS Virginia"
5,Iron Monger,"This iron works well sitting on my oversized ironing board. Great for sheets, duvet covers, pillow cases, etc."
3,Not that great,Purchased item to make ironing faster and easier and it didn't. Maybe a bigger surface might work better.
1,Not pleased,"I had to return this Table Top Steam Press. I thought it much bigger than it really was. The Prss worked just fine, it was too small for what I wanted it for...Thanks...Bob"
2,steamfast sp 660,"I received this item with no instructions,no warranty card and missing a part. Kept it anyway, too much work to send it back. It works ok on pants and t shirts, can't use it on man tailored shirts."
3,burn yourself on your new steam iron,I really like the way the steam iron works. I used last night for the first time it's easy to set up and easy to use. Just be carefull around small children. It puts a nice crease one the jeans and other things.
1,CRAP! CRAP! CRAP!,"The steamer is a piece of crap. The main problem is there was no steam. Give me a break. You may be one of the lucky ones where the steam actually works. But be leery, it looks like Amazon sent me someones elses previous defective order. I can tell by the way the items were packaged in the box. So I'm sending it back. Maybe Amazon will send it straight to you? If you like gambling, go ahead and order. But I'm sending this one back and requesting a full refund."
5,Convenient,"Good size, good weight. Not too bulky. Easy to take along. Works well. Steam unit has tendency to drip, though."
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,The press works but certainly not worth the cost. Very noisy with alarms and other undesirable audible features. I gave it away to chairity.
4,Does everything I expected of it,"I bought this primarily for pressing pants. I am fussy about sharp creases. This product does everything I want it to do. I previously owned a Singer which, after about 10 years, died on me. This one is very similar in size and function. The electronics have probably been updated. If you take a few minutes to learn how to use it, it does the job well. My only quibble is that it takes a really long time to heat up. So be patient. And to avoid wrinkles, pay attention to which part of the pants leg you start with."
2,GREAT LITTLE ITEM,"GOT THIS FOR CHRISTMAS AND IT WORKS GREAT.I DID ALL MY SHIRTS MUCH QUICKER THEN USING AN IRON.THE STEAM ONLY WORKS WHEN STEAM LITE IS ON.A TIP ONLY USE DISTILLED WATER OR HOLES WILL PLUG UP WITH LIME DEPOSITS,YOU CAN GET THIS WATER AT WAL MART."
3,Fragile luxury items,"When I hear ""cast iron,"" I think of heavy rugged cookware that can stop bullets and outlive me. I think of pieces that can withstand pretty much what you throw at them or throw them at.However, with these glamorized cookware with a high price tag, I find that I tend to treat them with more care (e.g. to avoid scratching the beautiful enamel). I don't bang them on the grill as I would with normal cast irons. So one of the defining properties of cast irons is lost to me; it's like cooking with glassware.And here's what really made this a 3 for me: I was showing them off to a friend of mine, he took the saucepan and for some reason part of the enamel came off the edge, exposing the cast iron underneath.The thing still works fine, of course, just like how any other cast iron saucepan would. But I'll be annoyed by that chipped corner for the rest of its life."
4,Fun and fancy,"This book has a lot of repeat recipes I've seen in other books but has many nice suggestions for crafts, place settings, decorations, candles etc."
2,WARNING!,"Though this has some great guitar picking on it, the version of ""Cocaine Blues"" on this CD is an INSTRUMENTAL!! The song, when it is SUNG, has some of the best anti-drug lyrics ever. Whoever put this compilation together decided not to put a disclaimer on the CD that this is an instrumental version.The label is Smithsonian Folkways, Buyer Beware!"
4,Good reference book,"Although the title might not highlight its use for learning the Bosnian language, this dictionary is very helpful for that purpose."
5,My current favorite CD,"After Soundings released ""Prayer"", I was waiting for a follow-up and this is it. I play this almost every night before bed because the chants are soothing and inspiring. It helps me sleep and wake-up in a good mood. This CD is a rich cross-cultural musical journey featuring mantras from the world's major spiritual paths and some of today's top ""chant"" artists. I love the selections by Deva Premal, Snatam Kaur, Manish Vyas & Dina Awwad, and Gina Sala. If you like chant/kirtan music, you will not be disappointed with this CD."
5,Asterix is a cool guy!,"I've never read this book before, but I love Asterix books! I'll bet that this book is really funny. I hope that there are Latin phrases in this book. If you haven't taken the time to learn Latin yet, there must be something wrong with you. I'm sorry for you. :') Bye!"
2,A bit disappointed with this book...,I was looking forward to receiving this book very much and I have to say I was a bit disappointed when it got here. Although it is very thorough it has NO COLOR PICTURES. Jewelry is something that cannot be appreciated to the fullest in black & white. I would have been much happier if they had atleast done half of the pictures in color.
3,"too much text, very few pictures","It is a good resource book, gives a lot of details on the actual HISTORY of jewellery. But relying almost solely on text when writing of something as visual as jewellery is somewhat dry. For an (antique) jewellery aficionado, not so much interested in knowing all the historical facts but more in appreciating the variety, craftmanship, style and beauty of jewellery, this is a wrong book to own."
4,Important reference book!,"This is an excellent reference book for any jeweler, historian, or SCA participant. There are over 400 photos in the book, which say it all.If you're working with jewelry for costuming or historical reference, start with this extensive survey of jewelry styles over seven centuries.Great information!"
3,I've had better.,"I have no complaints about the seller, the product arrived in time and in new condition. But don't really care so much for the game. It gives me a headache and I haven't found a background music that is at all soothing."
3,Fun but too many choices,"This game set is great for the enthusiast, but I found too many choices. A lot less to choose from (tiles, patterns, etc) would have been better. Overall, still fun for the person who enjoys mahjongg."
2,mahjongg puzzle,"Not what I expected from the name Hoyle, many repetitive design, the 3d isn't all that."
2,Hoyle Mahjongg,"Hoyle Mahjongg is interesting buit I find it isn't easy to use and doesn't have the variations I was looking for. Besides, I wanted a program where the cd wasn't needed in the cd drive to play the games."
2,DISC NO DISC,THIS GAME HAD LOTS TO OFFER MAYBE TO MUCH.WHAT I DID NOT LIKE............. UNLIKE MY OTHER HOYLE GAMES YOU HAD TO INSERT THE CD EVERYTIME YOU WANTED TO PLAY. I RATHER ENJOY NOT HAVING TO DO THAT
3,Hoyle Mahjongg,I have only played this once for about 45 min. I do like Mahjongg games. I just haven't had alot of time to play it.
3,A precautionary note,"It is a reasonably good version. You should, however, know that it is necessary to have the CD in the drive whenever this game is played. That quickly becomes a pain in the neck."
2,Not sure about it,I am a senior citizen and spend a lot of time on my computers. I have become addicted to playing all sorts of Mahjong's games and ordered this one. My disappointment is in the fact that i have to put the disc in to play each time. Other than that it is a good and beautiful game.
1,Not what I paid for.,"For some reason this game came with Mega Mahjongg by Inertia Software. There is no Hoyle product on the CD.I've been scammed. It even has a Hoyle Mahjongg printed CD.Can't change screen resolution and stuck in a tiny window. screen locks up constantly. Tried 3 computers and the games locks up or graphics freak out. (ie. Tiles go partially blank, layers of tiles disappear and come back, sections of the screen disappear and come back.)I have Intel HD300 graphics, AMD 6870, AMD 6650D built-in.CD must be in machine to play :). what a PITA.What the heck is going on here?"
1,Doesn't work,Installed on my comp and it starts but freezes every time. I just can't play it. This game is useless.
3,"Not a bad book, but . . .","if you are serious about learning how to write sitcoms, the Evan Smith book ""Writing Television Sitcoms"" is much better. Smith's book gives better more detailed advice, plus it is more current."
4,Recommended. A focused and concise book on sitcom writing.,"This book gathers the basic information on sitcom writing an a refreshingly straightforward manner. Because of the focus on successful network shows, the examples are necessarily lame. This book focuses on the structural requirements of teleplays as well as applicable business constraints.This will not teach one how to be funny. No book can. But, as the book states: jokes are easy. Story is hard. This book will help you craft a better sitcom story in a professional manner."
5,"If you're ready to write, this book will help you focus","Boy, did I love this book... Mr. Wolff engagingly shares his experience as a veteran of the sit-com world with his audience of hopefuls, and makes it not only understandable but enjoyable. I was especially motivated by his step-by-step exercises designed to free the muse. And even though he was very direct about the chances of an unknown actually selling a show, he made me feel I can -- and will-- succeed. If he's this good on paper, I can only imagine how inspiring he would be in a classroom!"
5,"Simply, the best","I've had a scale or two over the years, and none could surpass this one. It's built solid, is extremely accurate down to tenths of a pound, and the design is superb. It has the appearance of a very high quality scale, but I'll tell you, if for some reason, it ever conks out on me, I would just replace it with the exact same scale again. The accuracy alone is well worth the money, especially when you are dieting. You can really keep track of your progress, and feel assured that you have a dependable poundage reading. This has given me complete control over my weight."
4,Salter 905 Bathroom Scale,"This is a very attractive and accurate scale. My wife, who is averse to weight scales, really liked it."
2,Do not purchase this scale,"I made many good purchase through online. Sometime, I would have something that I was regret to buy. This is the one.Nothing is wrong for this scale. It may work as design that the scale is so sensitive and when one steps on to it, it starts to change the digital display constantly as you dumped a big file on a computer screen. You may stand there for ten minutes and can not get a reading. Every foot move or shakes will cause the scale to react instantly and long last.I do not return this product since I kept forgetting to do so and I hold it too long. But I rarely use the scale."
1,Stay away from this item,"Received the scale with nearly nothing in the way of instructions. The glass platform was not attached to the scale itself and there are no instructions as to how to attach it. Tried web sites for Salter and their distributor and e-mailed each of them twice asking for information. No answer from either. And, oh bye the way, the batteries that came with the scale were dead which require even more investment in a product that I cannot use."
4,practical,"Practical advice for a gaijin such as myself. While this book does not make one an expert on business in Japan, it does help as a nice introduction."
2,As Feeble as Miss Marple,"Late Christie and a dithery, fluttering Miss Marple who is only peripherally involved do not make a good combination. Although she does some surveying and map-reading to discover the house where the body of the woman seen strangled on board a train has been hidden, she does not apply reason to the problem of two murders caused by a tontine will and the identity of the woman (two fairly standard ploys), but experiences a revelatory flash-not, of course, shared with the reader, who has no chance of spotting the culprit."
1,"MMmmmm, Not very good!!!!","I'd heard plenty of the great Agatha Christie,mystery writer supreme, and decided, with anticipation, to try a taste of one of her more celebrated novels. But, alas, disappointment. I was amazed at her stringy sentences and lack of any form of decent prose. Her basic descriptions, substandard inter-person dialogue and her tinpot characters. The plot hinged too much on coincidence, Mrs McThingyMeJig just so happening to see the murder and, simultaneously, just so happening to know the illustrious Miss Marple. And the ending!! Please!! Ms Christie is obviously from a different age and, in my opinion, far too middle/upper class to attempt to attack any form of crime/murder fiction."
5,Great Miss Marple Mystery,Another great mystery. Only two little old ladies believe a woman has been murdered and one of them sets out to find the body and solve the murder. Wonderful mystery with a great twist and yet the murder ends up to be very simple--vintage Christie.
3,"Pretty Good, Not Fantastic","I enjoyed Lucy Eyelsbarrow's character very much, and was surprised that Miss Marple played a very backseat role to her. Other people have said this was solved through detection, which is true, but sometimes I felt that everything was too convenient. Fun for a quick read-- or a change of pace from the modern mysteries."
2,Not quite the best from Agatha...,"Agatha wrote really good detectivestories, but thisone wasn't that good... The beginning was good, but in the mittel of the book the tempo gets slow as a turtel. The las 25 pages has the same amount of fackts and other things relevant to the red line as the rest of the book together. I read alot of christies, and this might have been the worst, to be honest!"
3,"Good Read, Except The End","I really enjoyed reading this novel, in fact my first from Agatha Christie. It was really good to read but I was somewhat disappointed at the end. It was not up to the theme of the novel."
2,One of the very ordinary Christie novels I have read,"In this novel, there are no grounds given for Jane Marple's suspicions towards the murderer except the appearance of the backside which is hardly credible."
5,Return of a Classic,"A good solid Christie in a sturdy and economical hardcover edition. No special features, but the text doesn't need any. 4:50 FROM PADDINGTON generally makes the short list of ""best Christies."" One of Miss Jane Marple's friends has seen a murder taking place on another passenger train, and, absent a body or a missing persons complaint, no one takes an old lady seriously--except Miss marple. I'd like to say that the solution to the murder hangs together nicely, adn I never saw it coming."
3,One of the Weaker of the Miss Marple mysteries...,"I think my title prettty much sums this book up!! Now, don't get me wrong, I love Miss Marple!! Hercule Poirot does not even come close in comparison!!! This book started out a bit slow...stayed slow...and ended slow. IN FACT... I might even go so far as to say that I enjoyed MURDER SHE SAID (the Margaret Rutherford movie based loosley on this book) a bit more than the book. (A RARE thing for me to say)!! A should read book but not a Must Read!!!"
5,Excellent Book,Every serious reader should read Agatha Christie's books. They make you think without wearing you out. Quality stories that are classics.
4,What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw,"I enjoyed listening to Joan Hickson's reading of ""4:50 from Paddington."" She did an excellent job of portraying the different characters, but also somehow making it seem as if the entire story were being related by Miss Marple herself. The interesting thing about this book is that although it's billed as a ""Miss Marple Mystery,"" Miss Marple is not really the main character. In fact, no one really is the main character--unless it's the murder itself. And despite my usual method of assuming the least likely suspect to be the murderer and working back from that, I never figured out whodunit until Miss Marple revealed all. Very entertaining story."
2,For profefessionals only...,"This book is a good (not great) reference for home planners, engineers or interior designers but if you are looking for inspiration and the newest lighting ideas, well...try somewhere else.I expected a book with nice color pictures, beautifull layout and ambient lighting ideas and felt most disappointed.Almost every picture reminds me of my grand mother or my old aunt home, they are so outdated! and the quality is so poor!! So don't get mislead with the front cover picture!!!..."
5,A lighting technique that works!,"I've read a few other lighting books over the years but found that Whitehead's approach is superior for creating moods in rooms. My wife and I prototype interiors in our home and the results from ""A Practical Guide"" have been outstanding. We move and change the lighting with temporary luminaires and various wattages to explore the various possibilities before using them in real designs for clients.Beware - after buying into his concepts you will be frustrated by the lighting almost everywhere you go.- jim"
5,Excellent Resource,This is the best book that I have seen on the topic. The practical advice is well balanced with technical information. A must-have for any Designer's Resouce Library.
2,Fillers,""" 24 dance floor fillers and instro killers culled from Sandy Nelson's Imperial albums and singles, 1965-69."" That about sums it up."
1,Dishonest packaging,"When I purchased this the picture showed a bottle of NADH 10mg, 30 tablets. What I received was a box stating the same thing - 10mg, 30 tablets. So no big deal, right?The problem is that the back of the box states 2 tablets equal 1 dosage of 10mg. These are 5 MG TABLETS, so if you're thinking you'll be able to take 10mg per day for 30 days you'd be wrong. This package has enough for 15 days-NOT 30."
3,It's ok,"NADH is ok, the result is not long lasting,after consuming one tablet, i can feel my heart beating rising, but after like 3 hours, the feeling leaves."
5,"Good air hose, but watch the fittings","This is a nice hose, but the fittings caught me by surprise. Instead of 1/4"" NPT threads, they have 3/8"" NPT. I could not find the correct fittings for 3/8"" NPT with a 1/4"" coupling in Omaha (tried the big boxes, specialty nail shops, etc.). I didn't want to add adapters, so I ordered the correct fittings from McMaster Carr. The hose is light and appears flexible, but I'm hoping that as it ages it uncoils more cleanly. We'll see how it works in the hot weather, that may do the trick."
5,Dark Fairytale,This book felt like a dark fairytale to me. I absolutely loved it. It's written for young adults but I think that even adults like myself would enjoy it.
5,Between Choices and Destiny,"I read Mr. Wooding's The Haunting of Alaizable Cray and I loved it. So when this book came out, I really wanted to buy it. It needed lots of patience but finally I got it!It is so AWESOME. I thought it would be like other fantasy story but nope, got to remember that this is Wooding's. The author has delivered more than I expected. Not too far from his style (which can create movie scenes in my head) but it also has surprises. Very recommended, specially those of you who like to think about destiny. Food for thought."
3,Not bad for the money.,"I have been on my second set of these since 2005. The only reason the first was replaced was my cat chewed up the wire and simply was irreparable. While they are by far not the best on the market I have not found any compelling reason to replace them. On both sets the clip on the back of the volume control broke off within days. The sound quality is decent and they are quite comfortable. I have worn them for prolonged periods of time over the course of the years without any discomfort. If you're looking for a budget headset I think these are an excellent choice. If you are looking for something more high end then pass these up and go with something else. Overall, I give a 3.5/5. Good value, decent quality."
2,Worst logitech headset ever used,This is one of the worst logitech headset i ever used i had previously used H555 and clear chat their sound quality is far better than this one.
1,Uncomfortable; ineffective.,"Headset design accounts for one size fitting all. It is fairly uncomfortable, and the sound leaks tremendously from the headphones - you might as well have the speakers on.The microphone, on my model, is exceptionally quiet and must be inserted a specific way into the mic jack.The sound controls are not responsive. Sound will either play at full blast, or mute."
1,Horrible Design,"Whoever made these never thought to try them on before shipping them out. The earpads don't seat right, the mic is in the wrong place, and they just don't fit right. Having 0 adjustment options doesn't help."
2,Disappointing,These are uncomfortable and sound cheap. I have a no name Chinese made pair that are more comfortable and have better sound and they cost half the price. But at least I did not pay for these as they were a gift to my son. And he does not wear them...The USB adapter they came with is handy though. We plugged in a different pair of headphones and they work great!
3,"Decent headset, not great, could be Impoved","I bought this headset mostly because I didnt want to spend a arm & a leg. But like my title says, its decent but not great. I like the behind the head style headphones an headsets. Sound quality is pretty good id say. It works with Windows 7.Things Id change if I could1. they should be adjustable as they just barely fit around the back of my head.2. The boom mic could be a inch or 2 longer.3. the construction could be a nit beefier.4. the volume control should be closer to the headset possibly on it.5. Volume control would be better an easier to use if it was the older style wheel.All in all Id say check the New/Used/refurbished area (like I did) an get them as cheap as possible."
1,DO NOT GET IT,"barely picked up any noise at all, made sure it wasn't muted, on the wire and virtually, and still picked up next to nothing. by day 2 it gave me a blister on my ear from the foam pads, and it completely stopped working the next day. BestBuy wouldn't take it back, so I was screwed. Paid $50 and it is a piece of junk! DO NOT BUY IT."
2,Not the best...,"Well, I bought these about 8 months ago and I am now searching for a new headset for gaming. This one gives a headache after awhile from the weight and the headset is NOT adjustable size wise. Just one size so make sure you get the right size. The cord gets tangled way to easily and I have given up trying to keep it untangled.Definitely not my favorite."
1,Crappy headset,"These are uncomfortable, the mic is hard to position, and my seat died after less than 8 months of use. Would not buy again."
2,Not wise to buy this headset,"The reason I gave it two star is that its quality is acceptable, but to me a headset has to be ""comfortable"", that weighs the same if not greater than the audio and microphone quality. This headset is extremely uncomfortable. I can never wear this headset longer than 30 min because it really bothers my ear. I only wished I read reviews then money wouldn't be wasted"
1,do not buy,I have owned three pairs of these due to two of them being replacements from the first set broke. The wires broke from just being wires hanging from the head set which don't get me started the headset after o say 30 minutes your ears hurt like hell and do not trust me buy these. I got my second pair and within two weeks it they broke. I love Logitech trust me I own a g15 a g13 a g510 a g19 g330 but I will never buy this headset from Logitech.
1,don't go for white unless you want beige!,To me white is white but this is not true when you order the half-pint in white - be prepared for the front [plastic part] to be beige while the sides [metal] are painted white. In my opinion it is not a pretty picture...
5,uhhh weeeee,"that's what i am waiting for, damnthis cd will rock your ass!!!!!all i can say: perfect cominationdancehall is the future"
2,OK CD,"For those of you who enjoy very harsh ""raggae"" sounds with average beats and harsh, coarse vocals, this CD is for you. For those enjoy a more intelligent beat with smoother flowing vocals, stick to the individual artists you enjoy (i.e. Damian Marley.) The only good thing this CD has to offer is the variety of artists on it, but the names are all you get. Music on this CD in general was simply not what I was looking for, but maybe perfect for someone else."
4,Very Sweet,"A sweet book of bible based verses relating to everyday life and challenges faced by children. Great nostalgic drawings, with an easy-to-follow format for non-readers as well as readers."
3,Nurse in Yellowstone Park hospital,"Misty McCall is a staff nurse at the Yellowstone Park hospital during the winter tourist season. She rooms with her best friend, Ginger, another staff nurse. At the hospital, Misty clashes with Dr. Neil Rogers, who has a bad temper. But Dr. Rogers has problems of his own with his near-deliquent niece, Margie. When Misty and Margie become friendly, Dr. Rogers sees Misty in a better light.A likeable light read, enhanced by the beautiful Yellowstone Park setting. Misty and staff deal mainly with tourists' and hikers' injuries. This story is worth reading."
2,just not interesting,"This was like an action movie in print. Too much time moving through sewers and shoot-em-ups. No real character development, so I just didn't become engaged in the story. There are no really interesting motives to the crime -- just money. The characters are all two-dimensional. I didn't really care about any of them. Too much time with the good cop/bad cop thing also. The main character's internal musings aren't engaging either. The detail is not intriguing or enjoyable -- pages and pages about the underground sewer system and the layout of basements, etc. Although some plot implausibity is certainly OK with me -- this one was over the top. This guy was hospitalized for days (weeks?) with a life threatening wound and before you know it he's running around London, leaping hedges and submerging his wound in sewage. And the memory loss thing was just stupid in my opinion. Sounds like I should give one star instead of two."
2,Lost,"Not nearly as good as was expecting - plot way too convoluted... tries to be too clever, and it simply doesn't work"
3,Lost,"I can't quite give this 4 stars because I thought it was a little slow. I love Michael Robotham and like a lot of suspense/thriller authors I read, his mind scares me. To be able to write as a cop and a psychologist and do it so well and then to write such twisted story lines.... creepy. This book was about a cop with amnesia trying to piece together some of the events that happened that landed him in the hospital, in a coma for 8 days. I thought the ending was brilliant but the rest of the book dragged on.Would I recommend it? Is it Michael Robotham? lol Of course I would!"
5,"Fine suspense, excellent audio version","This was my second Michael Robotham book, after Shatter. I'm inadvertently reading them in reverse order. Lost is terrific, like Shatter. The plot is finely-woven, the pace is suspenseful, the characters are authentic and multi-dimensional. Robotham's voice stands out as relatively unique in the sea of mystery-suspense fiction.Ray Lonnan's audio narration is captivating, in strong British-accented language that moves easily across strong and weak, male and female characters."
1,So Disappointing a Book for an Otherwise Good Writer,"I read another of this author's books, so just went ahead and ordered this.I could not root for this character who didn't seem real to me like the psychologist from the later book who I was rooting for.I guess I don't like 'jokey, brash' characters and this wasn't worth my usual level of concentration.I finished it, since I paid for the book, but will be careful to avoid works that feature this wise cracking lightweight."
4,Engrossing throughout,"This well-written thriller keeps its action rolling and the pages turning from start to finish. It's especially fun for those of us who enjoy yarns set in London, as it travels from one end of that city to another -- and under it as well, where the author gives an evocative depiction of the sewer system. If the leading character, Detective Inspector Ruiz, is in fact 60 years old, he is the hardiest old bird on the force for sure. But his age is of no particular significance here."
1,strong enough to repell people; useless against pests,"This was a terrible product. I'm not sure if it scared any little pests away, but it did scare the entire family away from the rooms where it was placed. It emitted a loud enough noise for the human ear to pick up and was so disturbing that it interrupted the watching of television. After a few days of using these, we quickly got rid of them."
1,The Eagle and the Rose,"My book club read the Eagle and the Rose this month with high expectations. We were sorely disappointed. We expected insightful and inspirational content. We found neither. Edgar Cayce and Carlos Castaneda's books did a much better job 20 years ago. We expected a well written narrative that would keep our interest. Instead we were bored, the writing so repetitive that most of my club members actually had to force themselves to plow through the book. And the last chapter written in the third person (as if the reader didn't know who the ""little girl"" would turn out to be) seemed overdone, to say the least. All and all, we were very disappointed."
5,This book has changed the way I look at life and death,"I had this book for a year before I actually read it. When I finally picked it up I couldn't put it down. It touched me with those who had passed away in my life, especially my father whom I have had so many questions. In a way Rosemary told me that he was near and that I would see him again and get to know the father I never really knew. This book also taught me how to deal with my own interpretation of the afterlife. I would recommend this book to all, and have given this book to others for guidance. This will in fact change your life as it has mine. Rosemary, to all your struggles through life I commend you and wish you well in spreading the word of an awareness that proves truely an inspiration."
5,truly unforgetable,Gary Linderer and all the men of the LRRPS give you a first hand account of what it was like to sit through hours of boredom one minute then to have hundreds of enemy soldiers suddenly appear and make your blood run cold with terror as your mind races to the thought that you could be discovred and face 20 to 1 odds . This as with all of Garys books are highly recommended reading if you are the kind of reader who can actually picture yourself being there with him.
1,Return books for a full refund,"As of yesterday, Random House, Inc. has removed the fake military awards and decorations from its web site on this author's books.Gary A. Linderer has claimed to have received 2 Silver Stars and 2 Purple Hearts for the same day's combat. That is a military impossibility! Yet, he still claims it inside all of his books. Anyone can return these books by this author Gary Linderer for a full refund because of the fake awards he claimed.The National Archive records (radio logs) that were found by the researcher Don C. Hall and author of ""I SERVED"" refute what Gary Linderer wrote in his books. That makes Gary Linderer's books ""fictional memoirs."""
2,"Good movie, but a discredit to the DVD medium","The movie itself is quite good, but what they don't tell you is that the original Spanish dialogue has been eliminated in favor of an unforgivable English dubbing. What's more is that there are no alternate soundtracks available on this DVD, and no subtitles to choose from. In other words, it's a low budget insult to the DVD medium where all these things are not just possible, but expected. I would love to see this movie in its original language before it was butchered, because there's some good film-making going on here."
2,Banderas & Neri are the 2 STARS in this rating.,"Francesca Neri and Antonio Banderas are a great match in a lousy movie. Neri (new to me) is beautiful and charismatic and did ever notice how the always dependable Banderas can make the worst movie tolerable? Here again he does some excellent emoting. Just like one of the other reviewers, the first 25 minutes are quite entertaining, but then it really becomes a violent, disgusting bore. While I was happy that Neri as Anna blew her three rapists to smithereens, her shooting of the two policemen was totally beyond redemption. That's when the film went to hell."
2,Interesting...but not for the reasons I expected,"I purchased this DVD because I liked Antonio Banderas in ""The Mask of Zorro"" and because I heard that his co-star, Francesca Neri, was the ""Italian Michelle Pfiffer."" As far as I could tell, they both are obviously very talented actors. However, the film story was terrible. It is a very graphic rape story with a very unsatisfying ending. I was glad I purchased the DVD though because Francesca Neri is truly an incredibly gorgeous actress - and she has one of the most gigantic Adam's apples I've ever seen on a woman!"
1,Outrage with Banderas,This movie is horrible and brutal with no interesting hooks and really bad dubbing. Antonio Banderas can not even save this movie with all his talent.
2,Save your Money,"The best description of this lackluster flick is ""HO HuM"" Banderas walks around like a lovesick puppy and goes off to Barcelona while his girlfriend gets raped by three thugs and then goes on a shooting spree all over Spain after having kill the three. Thin plot, bad acting and not great English dubbing. I should have been paid for watching it. At least I did get a good nights sleep."
2,THE TUBE CLERK,"Though fun to read, this is a slight, unpersuasive work, unlike its successor, the stupendous ""Indian Clerk."" Leavitt lifted his story from Stephen Spender's memoirs of the 1930s, causing Spender to sue successfully, forcing some edits. But Spender should have kept mum, for this part of his life was nothing to be admired. Brian, the protagonist/Spender, is a dim, weak, lying, closeted, no-talent Oxbridge graduate who lives off handouts from his aunt. He meets Edward, a young ticket-taker on the London Underground who is totally admirable in every way. The two are supposed to be from different classes, yet they speak and act exactly the same, which may only indicate Leavitt's poor grasp of period detail. Edward is honest about being gay and loving a man; Brian is a weasel who ruins the one sound relationship he ever had. What follows their breakup is a Spanish soap opera, with Brian magically speaking the lingo. Proceed directly to ""Indian Clerk."""
3,Received the wrong product,"I had my friend order this for me using his Amazon Prime because I needed it in a hurry... the cookie cutter I received is not the cookie cutter that's pictured. I looked at his Amazon account to be sure that he ordered the correct one, and he did indeed order this one. The one I received has a very skinny connection to the round part of the tail, so the tail fell off almost every time when I was cutting and moving the dough. The nose is almost non-existent, and the head is different, too. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to send it back so I made do with what I received. I will still attempt to send it back to be replaced with the correct one."
2,Should have been better,"Interesting twist in final 3rd of book, but I had simply lost interest by then. More than a few portions of the book could have easily been edited out with no impact on storyline."
4,A really good read,David Schow's first novel just rocks. Very psychological and more a character piece than anything. Definately a must have for how to right a novel.
2,lame,"This video does not teach you anything about surfing at all! It talks about waves lengths and tides and exercises you can do and the types of boards you can buy but nothing about learning to surf! It even has the gall to insert an video advertisement for something called ""the Vasa"" for about 20 minutes right in the middle."
5,I couldn't put it down,This isn't a topic I would normally be interested in but Ms Barnet writes so engagingly that I couldn't put the book down until I'd read the whole thing. The story of her great-grandfather is like a visit to another time and place. A very interesting time and place. And I loved the way the author's own humor kept shining through the narrative.
1,Peter Rabbit Cd....or the pieces of it anyway,The cd arrived all broken up in a plain manilla envelope. Tried to contact seller but was ignored. Completely and utterly unsatisfied with the product and the customer service. I have nothing good to say about this transaction..
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT,"This product says ""Jolly Rancher FRUIT CHEWS"".......I received the HARD CANDY. I called the Customer Service as soon as I received the wrong thing and asked for her to send me the CORRECT type of candy. She said they didn't have anything but HARD CANDY.....SOOOOOO It's definitely false advertisement because it CLEARLY states ""FRUIT CHEWS"" when you are ordering. I was buying this for my mom for Christmas because it's her favorite candy and I couldn't find them in any store and apparently I can't even trust to buy them on the internet anymore either. SO RIDICULOUS!!!! Needless to say, mom didn't get her candy for Christmas~ I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE TO BUY THIS PROIDUCT if you're wanting fruit chews.....because you won't get it."
3,Fixed Down,"When it actually comes to great songs from the pop scene right now, there always is a act that can make good tracks, but can awkwardly have a mixed bag in one as well. Coldplay has been one of those acts that have made some great strides in some of the most solid tracks out there in the scene the past few years. Their latest single is that example. Fix You, the second track from their record X&Y; is a more somber, but somehow a slightly fair song. It actually isn't one of their best songs, but it isn't a bad song at all. Although the track doesn't measure up like Speed Of Sound did, it still is worth glancing at for any Coldplay fan.Song: C"
2,what's with the do-re-me-fa-so...?,"I've never ever seen a ""fake book"" format like this with do-re-me-fa-so, etc. Having the words, melody line, and ""real"" chord symbols as well saves this book. But really, what's with the extra line with the do-re-me-fa-so..? If you're sequencing or playing piano, the complete score for many songs on ""Romanza"" are printed in THE ADREA BOCELLI SONG ALBUM (Hal Leonard, 2005)."
5,Discontinued in stores...,"This product was discontinued in salons here in Chattanooga, I shopped high and low... A friend suggested going to Amazon, and Amazon is amazing, they had it, again, a great value for the quantity of product, got my hair back in shape!"
3,"Good for the test, but not as a reference","I have worked with Linux on and off for a while, so I mostly got this book for review. This was the only book I used for this exam, and I passed with 86% in 10 minutes. So, I have to give it a decent rating on the basis of test preparation. The troubleshooting section is 8 pages long, and gave explicit answers to 4 of the hardest questions I saw on my actual test -- read that part if nothing else. I actually read the Chapters, skimmed the Labs, and skipped the rest of the book (the test is really easy).As a way to gain knowledge, I was not at all satisfied with this book. Many details are skimmed over and options are often used without explanation. For example, the author says ""use 'man -k' to get help on a topic."" OK, why the '-k' option? Why no coverage of '-K', or the difference between 'man', 'man -k', and 'man -K'? Overall, not satisfying..."
3,not too bad,"This book does have all of the information. Only problem is, it almost has too much information for the test, and is very dry and boring reading. I also read the Exam Cram book for this test, it was muche easier reading and took about 1/10 the time to read even though it was 100 pages more of reading. I scored a 90% on the test, so it was worth buying the book. If you don't know what your doing, I would recommend it."
1,The sorrow...,"I am currently a candidate working towards my LCA and I have found this book to be extremely UNHELPFUL. It is full of gramatical and spelling errors which make the reading impossible. I seriously suggest that if you are going to study for this test, get a better book..."
2,"Good, but could have been better!!","I am about to take this test Monday, I have read the book and seen some errors that I believe that should have been caught by the publisher before it got to the shelves. Besides the errors it is a pretty good book if you have the patience."
4,Leadbelly is the pioneer......,"I first got into Leadbelly about three years ago, after hearing various things about him and having a little listen. Leadbelly is one of the originals. Some musicians today, well, everyone knows that manufactured is too nice a term. Leadbelly lived how he sang, he lived a hard life and sang hard songs, but the amount of sheer beauty he can put into some of these tunes is breathtaking. Classics such as 'Leavin BLues' still have relevance today and others such as 'green corn' are great to sing along to. Leadbelly has a lot of detractors, he seems to be someone you either love or hate, but if he could get his way out of jail on a murder sentance by composing a song for the jail governer ('Governer OK Allen' is the tune) then he must have been onto something. This CD contains a pretty good summation of his work, so if you are into your blues and appreciate real skill, then buy this."
1,"Great LP, Bad Listing","One star for listing this as a 34 track collection. It's actually a superb, 5-star, 14 track LP. Wonderfully assembled, on the Stardust label (a subsidiary of Cleopatra). Don't be fooled, know what you're getting, and enjoy!"
1,DVD didn't work,"Stupid me. I ordered a DVD from another part of the world, which won't work in our ""region"". Stupid supplier and Amazon- I didn't know it was an issue until I got it."
4,Thin but strong as steel,"Even though the wire is not long for its price (quite expensive), its quality is great and really helpful to catch big fish."
5,The Real Face of Africa,"This book is the latest revelation in the tragic story of the plight of African nations. As special envoy for the UN Stephen Lewis has traveled extensively in Africa and has had first hand experience of the AIDS/HIV disaster as well as the effects of drought, hunger, war and the growing mortality rate due to disease. A very honest account, Stephen Lewis takes a critical and objective look at the part the UN and other institutions are playing in allowing this tragic situation to continue.If you are interested in developing a world view, read this book."
4,A hoot!,"I laughed out loud at least 20 times reading this book... bring on the Yodel Water and the Dew-Dew candy! True, the book is a bit thin: is it worth 50 cents per laugh? Not sure. A fun gift for Japanophiles, anyhow."
1,Bad product,"My rabbit wasn't particularly impressed with this food, and it caused her to produce three times the amount of droppings than she normally does. I can only conclude that there is a lot of indigestible junk in this food. I will not be buying this again."
1,Not A Good Buy At All!,"I guess this is the one I ordered as it wound up on my ""items to review"" but I did not pay $1697 for mine! Thankfully as I feel like I did not get my money's worth as it is. The 3 piece set I received was not nearly as good as one I had bought on ebay a few years before. This one is just too soft and gives no firm support at all. It also stays dented in after a short while. I flipped the top memory foam piece because of the dent and now there are two dented-in places. I just replaced this mattress with a much better memory foam mattress, from Sam's Club. Theis is a gel Memory Foam Mattress and comes inside a nice zippered enclosure. It is firm enough to provide healthy back support -- unlike this one.I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND this mattress!"
2,I LOVE this movie BUT...,This movie is great. I would give it 4 stars if it wasnt for the fact that this dvd version has 3 minutes of gore cut out. Dont be fooled. It says unrated on the back but this is definatley the R rated version....its a shame.
1,Ummm...Yeah.,"Ok, first the good news. This movie boasts the GRISLIEST Death-By-Shotgun-Blast-To-The-Head scene since Tom Savini's frontal lobes hit the windshield in Maniac. The bad news is, the other six thousand, two hundred, and twenty-nine seconds of this film are a completely pointless experience. I'd try to give a plot discription, but there just didn't seem to be one. Not worth the time it takes out of your life."
3,Evil Ed DVD review,"I love this movie but this DVD isn't really that great for the medium. It advertised ""Widescreen"" at the top of the box, but when you play it you can barely see any black bands at the top or bottom of the picture, it's more like FULLSCREEN. There aren't any extra features on the DVD besides chapter stops, so for the price it's not a great value. The audio and video quality are very good however. Also, it advertised this DVD movie version as the Unrated version, but it appears to be just the standard R version like the VHS edition."
1,Never recieved product,"Here it is over a month later and I still never received my purchase. after contacting the seller twice, i finally had to file a claim with Amazon. I don't recommend buying from this seller"
2,Is It Really Un-rated?,"When I heard about this ""Gore-fested"" film I said to myself, ""Well, this would be great to have on DVD..""; it said ""Unrated"" version,the Head splitting cover on it also! so I ordered it! Any ways, alas I watch this film. But it seemed that it was ""edited it-self"", because every ""Gory"" scene came on; the blood shed wasn't there (not enough!) Especialy towards the end...for those people who saw it know what I'm talking about! I hope I'm wrong at this, I was expecting more ""Blood-shed"". Or I've wasted 86min of my life. Someone please explain or correct me, or I'll go MAD!"
4,a weird one for sure,"the story is about a movie editor who has to view horribly violent movies and take out the parts that are too much.a few,although not shown,were a beaver rape scene and a bazooka blowing someones head off at close range.not for the kids!he starts to get whacky.plus theres some psycho out killing people...................its definately low budget!i think cult lovers will enjoy it most.the nuke em high and toxic zombies types.there are a number of gross things in this movie.i think a lot of people will be turned away by the excessive cussing and violence[as if those are any good reasons].the movie owner is a bit over the edge but tolerable.its alright.check it out."
2,Rent but do not buy!,"There where some parts with good FX like the final scene but for the mst part. it could have shown more. There where TOO MANY Evil Dead referances, I unterstand trying to show homage to a great movie but you can go alittle overboard. It wasnt a bad story but it was alittle shallow. There is mush better horror out there, rent it but do not buy."
2,"Confusing, no brainer B-movie",This was a weird black comedy about a nerd who watches movies and then goes beserk and kills.This movie makes no sense and the special effects weren't really that bloody.The acting was tepid because the unknown cast couldn't act.Rental only
1,a bunch of schlock - BELIEVE THAT!!!,"Even though this is the unrated, uncut limited edition, don't let that fool you if you have never seen this movie before. Yeah it sounds good, and you might want to purchase it (for all of you who are looking to discover new horror gems for your collection) as I did. But let me tell you, Ardustry usually does a good job releasing their movies on dvd, but this is not one of them. The movie itself is very silly even though there were about two good scares. The picture quality is like viewing a rented vhs tape. Also on the picture quality: the movie looks really dark and grainy most of the time making it hard to watch.So even though this dvd is going pretty cheap right now and you probably would not mind taking a chance wasting your money despite my review, believe me your money would be better spent on another title in the same price range.This movie does not earn a place in my coveted horror collection. Even if the dvd transfer itself was perfect in every way."
1,Careful! Read the back of can.......,"I did agree with these two reviews. Excellent refrieds; the best by far!Then one day I bought a can at SaveMart and the back of the can said ARIZONA where it ususlly said a Product of Mexico!! Sure enough, not very good now! Check it out. I am not sure if these will be replacing the Mexico beans?? But this is all I can find now- ARIZONA!! Blaach!!!"
1,Unbearably itchy!,"I love toeless hosiery, but these are the most uncomfortable pantyhose I have ever worn. If I'm sitting down at all the backs of my thighs start to itch so horribly, and it gets worse when I stand. These are awful, I can't stand it. The only good things I can say are unlike some toeless pantyhose I have worn in the past, the toe thong does not bind, and the lightest color actually is light enough for my skin tone, but it is so not worth the itching. Also, they run rather large, the material doesn't have nearly enough stretch and they bag around the ankles and knees. I'm only 5 feet tall but out over 120 lbs. and the smallest size is still too big. I'll give Hue's a try and I might even spring for the Donna Karan toeless panythose, but I won't get these ones again."
3,Lacking Product Information,"The product provides no information about how to properly size for it. The sizing information for this product applies to bras, not pantyhose."
2,Rough and noisy,"These hose are rough and thick, and while that probably prevents them from running so easily, it does not make them feel sexy or smooth.They also make a lot of noise when you walk if your thighs rub against eachother. Also not sexy.They'll do, but I'm really hoping the other pair of hose I ordered comes in before I have to leave for the wedding that I bought these for."
1,Ouch!,"The binding is too tight. I have a wide toe box. The moment the hose went on all the way, my toes started changing color. I thought that they might just need to stretch a bit, so I've been wearing them for the past half hour. Now, my toes are swollen. The strappy bit that wraps around the toes is too thick, too, to effectively be worn with a reasonable variety of sandals. I bought them to try with my wedding shoes, but they clearly won't work on any level. Will try Hue first, then DKNY. Hoping that something affordable works out ASAP."
2,Won't order again,"The color is a little dark for nude. The fabric is awful, there is no stretch. They remind me of old stalkings before the advent of lycra. I already ordered a different pair from another company because I can't rely on these for the even I ordered them for."
3,A little flimsy,"I managed to run these before even leaving the house. The small hole turned into a run down 2/3 the length of one leg in seconds. While many nylons will do this, the piece that goes between your toes to keep them on also had ripped in this same short amount of time. i hadn't been taking shoes off and on. I'd put my shoes on and walked around for maybe twenty minutes like this.I also bought a tape pair of these on Macys.com, and that pair I managed to wear without incident all night."
2,Not Happy - Not What I Wanted!,"I did not get what I wanted. I needed Utopia in size 3 and I was so confident that was what I selected. Instead I got Nude in size 2. I am so disappointed But I won't send them back. I can't bother! The occasion for which I needed them has passed anyway. I gave 2 stars, not because the product is poor, but because they are of no use to me!"
4,Nicely made product.,I bought these for the wife and they are nice looking and very supportive. She loves them and we'll buy more of the Berkshire products.
2,"yes, they are scratchy","i ordered 3 different brands of these stockings and although they do feel quite terrible, the nude shade is very close to my skin tone. i made the mistake of buying open toe sandals for a dressy affair and my legs are just too white. i think i'll just bear the pain for a few hours.i would stress though you have to buy a size bigger. i'm 5'5, 115 lbs. and the c/d or = sz 3 are perfect.p.s. i'm not ""Jim"" reviewing."
1,Terrible,These hose are horrible. They run easily and are extremely uncomfortable. Great idea but horrible execution.
4,Great product,"I just purchased three sets of these toeless kneehighs. I was a bit skeptical but once I tried them they were great. The band is comfortable, the binding around the toe was also very well made. I ordered the queen size which really did not seem like queen more like a standard size. I recommend this product."
4,Courtesy of Teens Read Too,"When Tracy's father drags her along on a summer vacation designed for divorced parents and their kids, it turns out to be a lot better than she expected.Insecure Tracy finds friends in Kelsey and maybe even Beka. She even meets a guy! Maybe ""Together Time"" isn't as bad as she expected...Or maybe it is. If she can find it in herself to be confident, to actually go for a guy, maybe it'll happen, despite what she may think. Of course, if she keeps thinking that way, her summer's not going to be exactly stellar. In the end, it's all up to Tracy.MY NOT-SO-TERRIBLE TIME AT THE HIPPIE HOTEL is a cute, predictable feel-good story. It's a well-written novel, populated with enjoyable characters.Reviewed by: Jocelyn Pearce"
5,Sooo Good!!,"this book was really good. i hope rosemary graham will write a sequel. it's a book i picked up and i literally couldn't put it down, except while taking notes in class (those are important). but whenever i had the chance to read during class...I DID!! i'm looking for another book kind of like it, but it's so hard to find one. the cover may not be interesting, but the book really is!"
4,the definitive source on the life of Milton Faver in Presidi,"Originally the thesis of Leavitt Corning for his masters degree from Trinity University, San Antonio. Edited and published by the university as a book. When this part of Texas was being settled, families had to protect themselves from Mexican bandits and hostile Indians. Therefore, they built private forts, hence the book's name. The book discusses two families: the family of Ben Leaton whose fort is now a state historic site and Milton Faver whose settlements have been restored and converted into luxury accomodations for guests. (see NYTimes, travel section, Jan 24, 1999) Recommended for those with a love for the Big Bend area of Texas, those looking for an out-of-the-way place to escape, those wishing to know more about west Texas settlements in the mid-nineteenth century."
4,Gift for Girlfriends,"For the women in your life that are hard to shop for, this is a great book to give. There's something every woman can relate to in this book. The title alone just makes you smile or if you want to, dance naked!"
5,Captivating and Awesome,"Carmen's humor is unbeatable and the book allows you to exhale. The title is creative, and tantalizing and it has your imagination playing tricks with you until the book is read from cover to cover. A very appropriate book to help one to grapple and cope with everyday life.Myrtle Bradshaw, New York."
5,Dancing Naked in fuzzy red slippers,"Dancing Naked in fuzzy red slippers is a literary mug of hot chocolate. It warms you with sweetness, page after page. The anecdotes, poetry and tales are full of motherly wisdom, sisterly chidings and the brutal honesty of an innocent child. I ordered 15 copies to send to my family....that's my brotherly attempt to open their eyes and to see them smile.Robert Rambo"
2,Not Ballads At All,"I was quite excited about getting this album because I am a big fan of Folk Ballads. However, this album really has no ballads on it. This album consists of up-beat songs that really don't have any heart behind them like the title would lead you to believe. I suggest listening to samples before purchasing this album. Also, this album really does not have much musical depth it is basically just vocals and banjo (or guitar sometimes)."
2,Complexity and Dead End,"The book combines elements of different philosophies: post-modernism, structuralism, and deconstruction. It is a meeting of vague philosophical generalizations and scientific terminology (e.g., neural networks), and as such, it muddles things instead of making them clear. The hope being that, if things look complex and muddled, people will consider the book profound.I have to say that stylistically the book is fairly well written, yet this is not something one would read for entertainment. Bottom line: this is an attempt at some sort of philsophical synthesis which, in reality, is an intellectual dead end."
5,Smokin' acoustic blues album!,"If you like blues John's a must have! He gives out more energy on the acoustic guitar than some electric blues bands! This is a must have for your collection. Great vocals, great guitar, great harp!"
4,green!,"High quality sporty fun green watch! The product came in right away, super speedy shipping! Love it! The watch is unique with a shiny green strap and yellow face with the 19 and 48 on the face. I don't know why, but I love that."
4,"Seems like a nice Calculator, but....","I haven't had time to explore this calculator, but it seems to have all the functions I need and is of decent quality-not bad for $20!The only place I find fault is in the documentation which are multi-folded ""booklets"" for a User Guide and Appendix. There are no tables of contents or Index in either ""manual"". They are essentially worthless and difficult to read, plus fragile. Fortunately, I was able to download the PDF versions and format them to 2 pages per 8.5 x 11"" sheet for printing. This makes it a little less unwieldly and easier to read, albeit, lacking in usefull information. Users are on their own after that. Apparently there are no after market books specific to this calculator that I have found."
5,THE calculator for the PE Exam,"I had stupidly thought that since my preferred calculator is a TI-89 that I should use the TI model for the PE Exam. Ha! I'm glad someone told me about the Casio, because it is a far superior choice. Key differences between the two that make it amazing:A solve routineResponsive keysClear displayMight I also add, for the FE takers out there, that it derives and integrates? Yeah, the TI30X is basically a cheapy free calculator in comparison."
2,"Good calculator, bad manual","Good calculator, but the user guide is a large one sheet fan-folded monster, nearly useless. Casio should redo this and issue an apology."
3,Appearance? For my calculator? Is it for picking up dates?,"Wow. That's what they want to know about the calculator; do I like its appearance? Wait, let me crunch the numbers on that! It seems to perform the functions it has just fine, and the layout is fairly reasonable."
2,Lots of Bugs in this thing,"First problem is that it does not simplify fractions.A serious bug is when merely adding decimal (floating point)numbers, for some reason it converts the result into a fraction. For example 2.5 + 3.9 becomes 32/5 instead of 6.4."
2,"I must be too dumb, or it's broke","I've cleared it, set the mode to ""math"" and when I add 2.2 + 2.2 I get 22/5 instead of 4.4. Am I missing something here?"
4,Calculator worked great for my class.,"Calculator worked well for my computer class, and did not cost an arm and a leg."
5,In the words of Steve Ballmer...,"I LOVE THIS CALCULATOR, YEAH!!!This is an excellent calculator. I used it for the FE, and did not miss my TI83 at all."
4,Not the most intuitive,"It's really a pretty cool calculator, but I do have a couple of gripes. First, the ""book"" that comes with it is pretty crappy, although it does contain all of the information if you take the time to dig through it. I found that your better bet is to go online and find it. At least then I can zoom it so that I can actually read it.Second, the default setting displays all answers as improper fractions, so if you enter 5/4 you get a result of 5/4. Gee thanks, that's helpful. After several minutes of jacking with it and digging through the book, I finally found a section buried way down in the middle that shows how to switch the display to decimal (the S<>D button). I'm sure that this might have been obvious for seasoned scientific calculator users, but not for first time buyers.Now, once you get past some of the quirks, it is a pretty good calculator. I like the textbook display. And for $18 (at Target), you can't beat it."
4,Very good,This calculator is very useful and offers many function that calculator like this doesn't.
4,Bang for the Buck like non other,"Casio has always been about Bang-for-the-buck and they have gotten really good at it too. I loved the constants and conversion features. The only aspect i don't like about this calci is it switches itself off after a short while, often while you are contemplating what to do. This is annoying because all the previous calculations in memory or the value on the display get viped out. This is why I am stripping one star out of its rating."
5,Very good for FE,I just got this product but so far its great. I am not sure yet if it can store more then one value in memory.but so far for my FE exam it's very good.
4,fx-115es worth the price,The new integration algorithm is much better than in previous models. That alone made it worth the purchase price. The intuitive algebraic numeric display is very nice.The one feature I wish were included would be the capacity to store entered equations and functions as well as variables.
4,"GREAT calculator, lousy manual","If there's a better calculator out there in the <$20 range, I haven't seen it. This is a huge step up from my wife's old fx-180P I had planned on using for the PRAXIS II math test (until I picked it up the other day and it rattled as I shook it).The road map-style manual is the only reason I took a star away from it. A booklet manual with an index would be a big improvement."
5,Calculator,"Excellent calculator. Given the price, the calculator is really good. It is easy to use and it doesn't need batteries."
4,Good Product,"I received the calculator exactly a day before the expected shipping date..which was very useful. The product was in perfect condition. It came in a sealed packaging (Casio)..So far I did not have any issues, though the button to turn on the calculator looks a little pressed..but it works fine.Thanks"
4,Pretty Good,"It's a good calculator, it does all the mathematics for you :) it doesn't graph though. It's reasonable for its price."
4,FX -115ES Calculator Review,"For the price, I really liked this calculator, which I use for straight forward engineering calculations. I have grown to like the natural display which reduces errors when multiplies and divides are used. My one disappointment involved complex numbers. While simple math can be done, one cannot take the sine or exponental of a complex variable."
5,Cutting-edge Calculator has arrived!,"Pros:-can calculate numerous things (basic calculation, algebra, simultaneous equation, integration, searching unknown, trigonometry, etc)-easy to use, no trick or other annoying mechanism-brilliant & comperehensible natural display of numbers, unlike traditional calculator which has dull display of numbers.-can undo your previous work-better than wolfram alpha website (no offense to wolfram alpha fans)Cons:-Unlike previous version of Casio calculator, this one does not has hidden games. (but of course, this is not a big deal)-Quite expensive"
4,Great FE Calculator,"I used this product merely for the FE exam, and would recommend it to anyone for this use. It was easy to learn (I sat with it for about 20 minutes pretest and felt perfectly comfortable with it during the exam). Even though I use a TI-89 for classwork, the switch to Casio for the test was no problem. Solid calculator."
5,Great cheap calculator for engineers (and for those who are taking the FE),"I followed the reviews, and wow, did not regret it. It is a great calculator once you get the hang of using it. If taking the FE or PE, familiarize yourself with this calculator before the exam, preferably when you start studying for the FE (~3 months). It takes time to get used to this calculator and the manual does not explain really well (example: when wanting to multiply two matrices, I kept trying save matrix A and then matrix B, but inadvertently erasing matrix A when saving B. I would then try to multiply them both and, of course, I would get an error). Once I overcame that problem, the calculator has become one of my favorite calculators. Of course, I can't compare this with my TI-89, but then, a TI-89 is not allowed in the FE exam."
5,Superb - best scientific calculator,"This is the best scientific calculator available on the market right now, and I have used several others. It features natural textbook display, convenient dual-power, a 2-line screen with replay, and importantly the ability to solve numerical derivatives and integrals. If you don't want to spend $100+ on a bulky, cumbersome graphing calculator, this is THE scientific calculator to get. I also have a TI Nspire CAS, but for simple everyday calculations I prefer the 115es.Advantages:+Low cost compared to graphing calculators+Small size, low-weight, low-power compared to graphing calculators+Natural textbook display+Complex numbers+Vector calculations+Differentiation and integration!Overall, it is way ahead of the scientific calculator competition.Disadvantages:-Doesn't take out trash. (yes that is so cliche, but I had to)"
5,Engineer's best friend,"if you study engineering, then you will appreciate to the fullest extent the power and ease of this wonderful calculator. Complex numbers are a thing of the past. Just by hand it would probably take you hours to complete a complex circuit analysis which include inductors e capacitors. Buy it, you won't regret it."
5,michael,"Nice calculator, very capable to do a lot of the calculations, matrix, equations solving and so on. Nice one as I use before!"
4,"Great Functions, Terrible Battery/Solar Panel (Beware for Exams!)","I agree with other reviews that this calculator perfoms many functions very well, particularly if you're sitting the FE Exam.However, beware! I have only had mine a month and the battery died already. The solar (apparent 'two-way power') panel is way too inadquate and the display just packs in, even under good lighting conditions. OK, I might have bought one with a bad battery, but you'd expect more out of the dual power panel. In summary you should make sure you have a backup for the exam - it would be a miserable experience to have studied only to be let down by your calculator. I notice that it turns itself off very quickly too after only brief time period, an indicator that the designers know it somehow sucks up power. Ironically I've had an FS-115s for 18 years without changing the battery, its shame it doesn't do vector, matrices and stats!"
5,"powerful, useful, smart","powerful, useful, smartbut if you need to take some national exam, with special requirement of calculator, do check first before buy it"
3,WAIT FOR THE PAPERBACK,"This book does not hold a candle to Primary Colors but it is readable. My main complaint is that the characters are not believeable from Charlie Martin on down. This man has been a congressman and senator for twenty years and is just now discovering that politics is a manipulative business, give me a break. The whole book is full of these fantasies so don't invest a lot of money in it."
4,Klein does it again,"Mr Klein builds on the success of Primary Colors, writing another book that makes the reader feel he is a fly on the wall in the political process. It's amusing, it's realistic...that is, if the view we get of the political system through the eyes of the media is truly ""reality."""
2,Save your money and wait for the paperback,"I love politics and picked this book up on a whim at the local bookstore. However, the first 200 pages are horrible. Senator Martin is an ok character, but his friends are dry, boring and useless; not to mention hard as hell to keep track of with those stupid nicknames the senator uses. After the first pages of tooth-grindingly boring Washington parties and receptions. I put the book down for a month. Thank God the book, puts Martin back on the campaign trail, because that is what saved the book for me. The last 100 pages are good, but is a little too little too late."
1,Unreadable,"As I had devoured ""Primary Colors"" I could not wait to read ""The Running Mate"". Much to my chagrin, it was awful. After a week of attempting to get through the book I just gave up--the hokey characters, contrived dialogue and mind-numbing inside the beltway details turned me off completely. Luckily for me I found it at the local library so my investment in this book was minimal!"
2,Did not receive my vote,"I was given this book to read by a close family member who loved it. I was extremely bored with it. In order to enjoy this book you really need a good understanding of Politics, and each party's view over the years. The author spends a lot of text covering the era of the Vietnam War, which I am not very familiar with, and so half the time I felt completely. The book does get somewhat better towards the end when the key character is in present day, and running for election against a backhanded competitor. (This book does not give you any warm and fuzzy feelings toward politicians). I was extremely glad when I finished the last page. I would not recommend this book unless it was to someone who had an interest in and deep understanding of politics."
3,Much like a politicians speech....a bit too long,"After being captured by Primary Colors, and the ""who wrote it?"" mystery behind its author, I thought I'd try the book Joe Klein put his name on. It is the tale of Senator Charlie Martin,(John McCain or even Bob Kerry) and his quest for the possible VP spot with Jack Stanton (he's back and as slimey as ever). Of course the road to success does not run smoothly, there is a percieved sexual harrasment problem and a romantic entanglement to contend with. Our hero(?) also tries to keep control of his staff, contend with the ever encroaching press and keep a lid on secrets, his and those of his opponents. There are many twists and turns. the story line does take some unpredictable roads. It is a well paced political thriller and an enjoyable read. It does lack the ""who wrote it?"" cachet that boosted Primary Colors. I found it just a little bit too long and a wee bit convoluted."
4,deliver took 9 days,the book was in o.k conditions and it took about 9 days to ve delivered at my dooor.
2,Why Bother?,"This is an over-rated and over-priced book. I am forced to use it, and find that there are better resources available in less expensive texts, and on the W3C School web site. The text is adequate, but barely so. Sell it if you have it, and avoid it if you can."
4,Get this book for kids who love to read.,"This book was really exciting. It's about a boy named ""Boy"" and when he loses a puppet that belongs to his master (a magician), he gets sent into the World of Story to find it. He runs into all kinds of famous characters from nursery rhymes and stories, and ends up finding the puppet, and a new name for himself. A heroic name. (I don't want to spoil the surprise). There were funny parts, serious parts, lots of action and I thought it was great. I think kids my age would love it (I'm 7-1/2). I read it very quickly; I finished it the day I got it!"
5,My 6 year old and I loved this,"I just finished reading this to my son and can't wait to find others by this author. It was exciting but not super scary. A very creative way of reminiscing about long forgotten fairy tales. Relatively short for a ""chapter book"", it took us about 3 nights to get through it. I just wish it lasted longer, it was so enjoyable."
3,Some of it is very good,"The first part is very good, and funny - Billy Crystal on stage, before an audience of Russians. Some of the other parts of the video are weak, or unfunny, but it also includes interesting shots of his new-found relatives in Russia. The last bit, on stage, with Billy acting as a Russian waiting in a long line, seemed strange - an American doing an imitation of a Russian, before a Russian audience - but the audience liked it, so what do I know? He's very talented, and I'm still a great fan, although I won't keep this video."
3,Poorly conceived packaging,"I have to agree with many other reviewers that the packaging for Season 11 is poorly conceived and executed. It certainly takes dexterity and patience to extract the discs, and they all have varying degrees of surface marks from being inserted during production. If I were going to be removing and replacing discs every so often this packaging would be far worse than it is, but my practice is to rip the discs to mp4 files and view those on a variety of devices (Simpsons on a big screen isn't necessary to enjoy the episodes anyway). As long as surface marks do not interfere with reading data, they have no functional effect. I hope Season 12 has been packaged with more intelligence than this one."
2,Worst Season Ever.,"Another huge Simpson's fan here but this is definitely the worst season (of the 13 that I own) of the show. Doesn't matter what I say, if you are a Simpson fan, you are still going to buy it. As you should. lol."
4,Worst packaging yet!,"Long time Simpsons fan. I own every season and of course I have no complaints about the content. But the packaging is horrible. The DVDs are held in individual sleaves of cardboard which slip in similar to old vinyl. However sleaves are all attached as part of another gimicky piece of artwork. Removal and insertion of the DVD's is similar to a game of operation, but instead of a buzzer, you ruin a DVD. Good Job!!!Will this discourage me from buying the next season? Absolutely not. But given Amazon's poor description of the different types of packaging, I will buy the next season in a brick and mortar to avoid buying the worst of the two released packages."
5,FINALLY!,"I think I feel the same way everyone else feels finally Season 11 on DVD to be released October 5, 2008.I hope they can get Season 12 out before the holidays to make up for the long amount of time it took to get Season 11 out. The Simpson fans deserve it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Lousy Packaging,I will not buy this nor should you until Fox does right by its customers and recalls this lousy edition and puts out a proper package that protects the integrity of the media from scratches.
2,Poor Poor Poor,"Not that I need to since almost every other review did the same, but I'm going to add myself to the list of people who hate the packaging because they REALLY went down in value here over the course of just 1 product! You can't see the dvd's, they're difficult to get out without scratching up the dvd or bending the box...just terrible.I wasn't a fan of the plastic heads, but that pales in comparison to how terrible this box design is.Other than that, I know everyone has their opinions of whether or not The Simpsons jumped the shark and when. Personally I'm in the group of people that think it started to drop off around season 9 or 10, but there are enough scattered episodes that I like well into the 13/14th season so I figured I'd keep buying the dvds for a little while longer. If they continue on this course of cheaper and cheaper packaging though, I think this will be my last season. Just not worth it for a few good episodes."
4,Krusty Simpsons DVD Packaging Prompts Me to Buy New Storage,"I share the disappointment in the packaging of the Simpsons 11th season. This will prompt me to buy DVD/CD binder and put all my Simpsons episodes (along with my X-Files DVDs, which also had crappy/awkward packaging) in there. This will save the packaging for posterity and from wear and tear."
3,Finally after all the wait...,"I can't believe I'm giving a season of the simpsons on dvd less than 5 stars...not because of the show and the episodes, they rule and they get a million stars (I even don't mind the Krusty plastic thing on the front it's cool)...please going forward don't do the cardboard packaging. I treasure my collection of the simpsons on dvd and they are all in pristine condition and this type of packaging ruins the discs. If it's about saving money I'd rather pay the extra $5 for plastic trays than this crappy scratch party. ""Go get Lassie!! Lassie?? I mean Lisa."""
3,"Good Season, Crappy Box","Like other reviews here on Amazon, Its great to finally own season 11 on dvd. I was so let down when I saw how CRAPPY the packaging was. I hope that Fox and Matt Groening do something about it in the future releases. I recommend putting your discs in slim dvd cases or cases that hold four discs. The 3 stars are for the Packaging."
2,Fire whoever is designing these boxes,"I thought the Homer Head box was the pinnacle of stupid in this series, but this one takes the grand prize as the absolute worst DVD packaging I have ever seen. The discs are imprisoned in incredibly tight cardboard sleeves. It is impossible to get the discs out without either bending the cardboard artwork, getting your finger prints on the bottom of the disc, or scraping the disc across the cardboard in a desperate bid to remove and watch them. The whole travesty is then folded up tight, accordion-style. Unfolding the packaging simply makes the discs impossible to remove. You have to jam your fingers into the folded version and hope you don't ruin the disc just trying to get it out.Whoever designed this mess should be fired."
2,Retarded BOX ! Worst packaging in the history of DVD !,"This is the worst packaging EVER.The heads were bad but at lest the DVD's were protected inside. This is the worst thing ever. The box cannot be put on the shelf with the other seasons due to the irregular shape. Inside the box, the DVD's are in cardboard sleeves. My whole package is scratched out of the box.They should fire the guy(s) who had these ideas.Back to Amazon it goes..."
1,The Simpsons: Now With Annoying Cardboard Packaging!,"Ok. This is the Simpsons season 11. You already know if you like the series. Regardless about how you feel in regards to the eleventh season of this series, DO NOT BUY THIS.Fox has changed the packaging and managed to create one of the worst and least protective boxes for a DVD ever! Seriously, it's a damn cardboard folder that you slip the discs into a sleeve. I've seen $5 computer software come in better cases than this. Between this and the horrible Futurama movie cases, Fox is trying hard to make the chintziest cases around. It must end!"
3,Great episodes as always but...,This is just a tiny review but beware of the packaging of this season! Gone are the clear plastic spindle pages to hold each disk in place. There are just in cardboard sleeves. The set that I got plays fine but had glue and several scratches on the disks from the packaging/manufacturing process. FOX better step its quality game back up!!
2,Worst Packaging ever...,"They better be offering a replacement again, there is no way to get the discs from the cardboard sleeve without getting fingerprints or worse scratching them. I don't know why they can't stick with the decent box set packaging they were using. they tried to get fancy with the homer head, but it failed. I hope they will offer a replacement again."
4,When the show was still good HORRIBLE PACKAGE,"A good season of the show.NO longer at it's best but season 11 is much better than the show is now.Took WAY TOO LONG to release season 11 to DVD after the release of the movie to DVD December 2007.Good extras as normal with the set. Other film makers should pay attention. Most TV DVD packages have little to NO extras. Even with season 11 at least we get a wide choice of extras to look at. And, they still have the brochure with info on each episode & extras.I still have every episode on tape. Yes, I still have a VCR & tape everyone.But, MY MAJOR COMPLAINT WITH THIS PACKAGE.HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE.It is 1 of these packages where you have to open both ends to get the inside with the discs to come out. ONCE YOU GO THROUGH ALL THAT UNNECESSARY WORK YOU HAVE TO FIGHT TO GET THE DISCS OUT OF THE TIGHT HOLDING AREA.WHOEVER THOUGHT THIS UP IS AN IDIOT!!That's all we the public who buys these want-UNNECESSARY WORK!!"
1,Are they freaking serious??,"Ok, first off....is it me or has is been like a year since season 10 came out? Further more, what the hell is up with this packaging? I deftly took my discs out of the sleeve and they were already scratched (presumably from moving around during transit) ...but this is not the case, A lot of these discs are CRAP. Several of my friends bought thier seasons from Wal-Mart and Target and found that the discs were also messed up. I am assuming in a ""rush"" move by FOX, the glass masters used to stamp these puppies out have been treated like crap. Much like the way the fans are at this point. Waiting for these releases is like waiting for the coming of CHRIST. Matt Groeining said it best several box sets ago...""By the time the whole series is released, there will be a whole other format than DVD""...and I bet they are counting on the same schmucks to go out and by them all over again."
4,First fifteen minutes...,"Lardlad (via TVSHOWSONDVD) says October 7th for the release! Woo hoo! - Ed. 7/22/08I have to write in defense of the episode Missionary: Impossible. Some reviews describe this as ""ick."" Now, I am a lifelong fan, one who believes the show is still great. Every season has its highs and lows, and season 11 is no exception. This episode, however, falls defiantly (Yes, defiantly) in my favorites of all time. The first fifteen minutes of this episode are priceless (""Why did I register with Instatrace?""; ""Their bloodthirsty pursuit is made possible by a grant from the Chubb Group.""; ""Yeah, it's a real ghost town in there."" etc...). Anyone who has watched PBS for more than 15 seconds can find this stuff hilarious.Yeah, the actual missionary stuff is okay, but the beginning of this episode holds its own with the best episodes ever.Plus, it gave us ""Jebus."""
1,Worst Packaging EVER,"The ""Simpsons"" episodes themselves are solid as usual my issue is the packaging, WTF Fox really I almost tore side of the item. PLEASE work on this issue it SUCKS the way that you package the item and apparently you did the same for season 12 & 13. On a positive note related to the packaging I do like the accordian style however getting the DVD's out was just aggravating. ""Modern Family"" was packaged nicely a was ""Futurama"" & ""Breaking Bad"" so please start packaging the DVD like that it would be fantastic."
4,Five-Star Show with 2-Star Packaging,"A great season with a few of the show's major plot events, notably Maude Flander's death and Barney sobering up. However, the packaging is terrible! Not only does it take tweezers (or at the very least, smudging up your disc) to get the discs out, but there is no lining inside the tight, cardboard slots to protect the discs from scratches! My suggestion is to buy a 4-disc DVD box to store the discs and slide it into the original packaging. Save your discs; this season is worth it!"
2,Good and Bad,"I had no doubts about the content of the product, since I'm a big fan of The Simpsons. As usual in all the DVD editions, the language menu is a little bit annoying, because you need to go to the menu to change spoken language or to turn off subtitles.But the worst thing is that all the disk came with a red stuff stick on it (probably paint) that makes some episode unavailable... definitely the box design is no good at all."
3,The end of the funny,"This is the point of the simpsons where many people believe that the show starts to declineI agreeIf you really want great simpsons, buy season four, the best comedy of all time."
3,"Painful puffy head packaging, not the regular style","I'll leave the debate about the actual quality of the 11th Season to others.But note that this particular item is the ""Limited Edition Collector's Box"" with Krusty's face protruding from the front of the box. You can identify in the box shot with the white lettering in the upper left corner.Apparently there is a standard packaging version (which I prefer). Currently that's listed on Amazon (with no box shot) for 25% more than the limited edition packaging costs.So buyer beware, if like me, you don't like the difficult-to-store limited edition packages."
2,"Mediocre season, WORST PACKAGING EVER","Yes, people argue about what seasons are good or bad but I wish I had listened to those who said to stop your collection at Season 10. Season 11 episodes struggle to hard to be funny and fail miserably in the process. There are a couple of keepers, but with with 20 episodes a year it's not that hard to get two or three right. Another point that is mentioned often in the reviews is the packaging,and IT IS AWFUL. I'm starting to get the feeling that someone has pure, uncontrollable hatred for the Simpsons-buying public. Why else would they make this awful cardboard contraption that is impossible not to damage if you try to open the slits for the discs more than 2 millimeters? And of course sliding the discs in & out between sandpaper can't be good, either. It's purchases like this that make me wonder if all my video-downloading friends aren't on to something."
2,Cheap Cheap Cheap Worst Packaging EVER!,"So far, 2 of 4 of my discs have damage. This is the cheapest, lousiest packaging I have ever seen any DVD set in. No way to remove discs without tearing the packaging or putting your fingers on the disc. Looks like someone wanted to make a few extra bucks by using the cheapest, cruddiest packaging EVER. And since you are sure to damage the discs, you are sure to buy this again. The only reason I bought it is I am a major Simpsons freak. So, unless you have a sick need to own them all, like I do, don't waste your money on this season. Whoever OK'd this at Fox should be tied to a flatbed and ran out of town, or catapulted. A fine example of how Babylon tries to suck the last dime from the workin man. Very sad. I am ashamed I was too weak to pass this up."
5,missing dvds,"simpson fans-my collection is missing a few dvd's.(disk 4 season 4 for example)does anyone know where i could buy replacement dvd's without buying the whole season again?thanks,Sam"
4,Excellent Season...Horrible Packaging.,"The Simpsons Season 11 is one of my favorite seasons, because of ""Behind the Laughter"" and ""Beyond Blunderdome"", however there are plenty of great episodes packed up in this season. Speaking of packed up, the box for this season is awful. I mean, please, whomever is designing these, please stop. Every time I want to watch Season 11 I have to take great care to remove the disc and I clean them every week because fingerprints inevitably get on them. This doesn't happen with any other season. When I remove a disc from the box, I'm a bit worried I might tear the cardboard because it's just so horribly designed. I tend not to be so negative in reviews, but this box is really bad! Please change it to something easier to access. I personally liked the way Seasons 6 to 10 handled it, with the book format. It was easiest to access and didn't forsake cover art or make you have to unfold just to get to a Disc 3 or 4. So please, change the box!J."
2,Worst. Packaging. Ever.,"I didn't think this was possible, but the packaging for Season 11 both sucks and blows. Who designed this craptacular failure? Not only does the box not stack neatly on the shelf because of Krusty's big bas relief but the disks aren't even in protective plastic but jammed into narrow sleeves, like LPs only tighter. Earth to packaging genius, this is the 21st century and we have moved beyond sleeves! One word: plastics.The season itself isn't bad, with such gems as Pygmoelian, Bart to the Future and It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad Marge. There are a few duds as well but on the whole I give the season a 3 out of 5."
1,Scratched,This product was for my friend and I just recently watched the video with me friend and it was scratched. The 1st disc out of 4 was terribly scratched and that is terrible. What should I do because I threw away the package because it was a gift?
3,"Funny as ever, but lousy packaging!","The eleventh season still has great quality writing and is as enjoyable as ever, so if you're a Simpsons fan you won't be disappointed. My only beef is with the packaging. I don't know why they couldn't just stick with the same packaging they'd started with. The first deviation were those molded plastic portraits. Those looked cool, but if you wanted to shelve them spine out, well, they made it impossible. So, the manufacturer relented and made both the conventional and the molded options available. But now the conventional packaging has taken a down turn, presumably to be more ""green."" They've eliminated the plastic trays with locking hubs in favor of sleeves (like an old LP album), in which the disks are inserted. My disks arrived pre-scratched, so taking them out and reinserting them would just compound the wear on them. So, for the content itself, I'd give four or four and a half stars, but I give the overall item three for bad package design."
1,VERY Disappointed in Season 11,"My husband and I are huge Simpsons fans. We eagerly awaited the DVD release of Season 11. What a disappointment! Each episode in this season is feeble in content and story line. The episodes fall extremely short of the usual ironic comedy, but true to life, situations that the Simpson family find themselves in. When Season 12 is released, we have decided to rent it, before buying, to assure ourselves that it is worth having in our Simpsons seasons line-up."
1,Garbage after season 7! KOTH rocks!,Why the one star then? The one star is completly FOX's fault. I can not believe they have not released season 7 8 9 10 11 or 12. Why? Are they protecting The Simpsons? No other anmie comedy show is close to The Simpsons other than King of the Hill. I have tried to watch the shows on FOX's streaming broadcost. It stinks! :(Every EXEC @ FOX should be fired.
1,RIP Simpsons,"As a life long simpson fan, I agree with those who contend that the show did go downhill around season 11 or so. The most current episodes are nothing short of crap and the movie was awful.It's sad that a show that once possessed humor that was so witty now contains jokes that my little 5yr old nephew could concoct.As dramatic as it may sound, it really is sad and upsetting to witness the gradual destruction of the once greatest and funniest show on tv. I hope that Groening and those poor excuses for writers will let the show die a much needed death soon."
1,Glue!,Despite reviews I bought this DVD. It arrived today and I am returing it tomorrow - I did not even try to play it (them). The packaging that holds the disks in place is held together by glue. Bits and pieces of the glue and the packaging have adhered themselves to the DVDs. How awful is that? Am I suppose to play 25 hours of stuff to see if they're OK?I would like to get a good copy of the 11th season but do not see how I am going to do it. I bought the 12th season too but it has not arrived yet -- it is suppose to have the same problems. I hope not.
3,Simpsons 11,"They took all that time before coming out with season 11 the least they could have done was make a case that does not scratch the dvds. You have to wedge them between two pieces of cardboard, don't know why they decided to downgrade."
3,Simpsons Season 11,"I've been a big fan of The Simpsons since 1990. I recognize that they peaked around 1996/1997, but I continue to watch since it's like ""hanging out"" with old friends. This season is lack luster (much as season 10), although I'm glad I own it, no regrets. It's a collector thing.The packaging is ""unfortunate."" I am someone who appreciates the plastic tray for its ability to prevent the discs from receiving scratches. Season 11 is packaged in an all cardboard unit that allowed for my discs to be removed with scratches. I was not pleased, but they play...well one disc has a weird pause, but...All of the packaging for this season seems to be the cost-cutting, eco-friendly cardboard, so people like me have to accept it."
4,"Four star content, one star packaging","I am a huge Simpsons fan, having all the seasons on DVD. This is not the best season of the Simpsons (my opinion), but it's still very good. Anyone who is more then a casual fan will enjoy owning this item.Except for the packaging. I don't know if the ""normal"" packaging ( I have the Krusty the Clown head special packaging that's shaped like Krusty) is any better, but it was a very poor idea to put the DVD's in deep cardboard sleeves that guarantee you will scratch them or fingerprint them!As another reviewed mentioned, I have the original packaging to all previous seasons. From season 6 on, the packaging keeps getting more creative. And not in a good way! Please, I buy this series because I love the show, not the box you keep the DVD in. How about going back to normal packaging, like seasons 1-5?Good season, terrible packaging."
3,If you get glue on it while opening the package you can clean it,"Yes the packaging to this DVD is horribleYou open it up and you get glue on your discsYou're supposed to slide the discs out of the cardboard box packaging [but if you do this they may get scratched!].Carefully slide out the discs without touching the cardboard box. It may be likely that you will get glue on your DVDs, however YOU CAN CLEAN IT! I did it with my discs, I noticed that there was glue on the packaging but when I cleaned off the glue with a soft tissue it went away and the disc played.Try this with your discs too if they get scratched. Good season with good episodes but not good packaging so be warned!"
2,"Horrible, Horrible Packaging",The packaging is horrible. The main problem is removing the discs from the pockets. My advice: buy the alternative box set. It will be less of a hassle.
3,"Awful, awful, packaging. Awful.","The exterior of this season set is very similar to previous seasons, but noticeably thinner. Earlier seasons had standard plastic trays for each disc, with a binding holding the trays together. The new set has a folded cardboard accordion thing. It's covered with some great art, and does help the set take up less space. The problem here is that the discs are nearly impossible to get out of the packaging. The pockets holding each disc are so tight that they don't slip out easily, and it's nearly impossible to get your fingers in there to remove the discs without tearing the pockets. I'm sure this packaging redesign was an attempt at being more eco-friendly, but it sucks."
2,"Yeah, the package is that bad","No, this isn't the best Simpson's series, but it's worth it to be able to laugh at the Mel Gibson episode.But that packaging is some of the cheapest **** I have ever seen. You would think that someone with the Simpsons would have realized what a horrible idea it was."
4,Love the series. This case is pitiful,The only thing I have against this season of the Simpsons is the pathetically designed case. The outside is incredibly bulky as a result of Krusty's nose and mouth. The inside of the case is even worse. They went away from the usual clip in sections and made more of a sleeve storage. That wouldn't be bad except for the fact that the sleeves are very stiff causing you to HAVE to touch the surface of the disc in order to remove each disc from the case. Fingerprints and smudges are unavoidable.
3,"Great episodes, lousy packaging","I found that the worst part of the new packaging design was the that the gummy glue substance that was used to sandwich the cardboard disc packaging together left residue on the playing surface of three of my four discs. This affected the play-back of the discs which jumped, pixelated and then froze. On getting the DVDs replaced, I now keep them in separate sleeves, I refuse to put them back in the packaging.I enjoyed watching the episodes and extras, but I won't be adding season 12 to my (currently complete) collection if they use the same ridiculous packaging method."
1,Extremely Weak season...,"Up to season ten, I don't think there was a better animated comedy show. This season, Holy smokes... I am sooooo disappointed! Literally not ONE laugh out loud episode. Not even one episode that is mildly amusing. I kept hitting the scene forward button waiting to laugh. No such luck. I'll buy season twelve to see if the show was back on form,If not, I'll have to live with my memories and seasons 1-10."
4,Worst Packaging Ever,"I love the Simpsons and these episodes are no exception, but the packaging is awful. The discs are in tight cardboard which isn't even clear which side your supposed to pry the disc out of. I think I'll throw the box out and put the discs in a book."
3,Who are the ad wizards who designed this packaging?,"Love the Simpsons.Hate the packaging.Makes me yearn for the Homer head.What did they save by doing away with the trays? 30 a unit?""A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man"""
4,Possible DVD case solution/Season 11 Rocks!,"Would it be possible to glue a clear,slim jewel case onto the accordion pages to make it look like the season 1-10 boxes?I haven't bought season 11 yet, but I thought this might be a solution if you can still fold the accordion pages back together and fit them in the box.Aside from the packaging issues, Season 11 was the moment before The Simpsons ""jumped the shark"" for me. I taped every episode of seasons 1-11 on VHS religiously, but I stopped watching the show after that. Once N'SYNC guest starred in season 12 the magic was gone.I'm looking forward to getting this set now that I know both versions are the same inside and that I may have found a way to protect the DVD's."
4,"Well, you'll never save Grampa's farm with that attitude.","It's the season that gave us the great Last Tap Dance in Springfield...Lil' Vickie! the Mexican Milhouse who must once again sugar his own churro! Freduardo! the cat that dances better than Lisa! and of course Tappa Tappa Tappa! What's not to love. Sorry, folks, Season 4 is over but it's still way the heck better than anything else out there.But, Fox, please stop screwing with the packaging. First it was those head boxes that made people request regular boxes. Now it's a really nice looking glossy accordian-style foldout that makes the overall package a bit slimmer but makes extricating the DVDs damn near impossible without getting paper cuts or cuticle damage. You might even need rubber-tipped tweezers."
1,"Buyer beware, must hate Bush to enjoy!","OK, here is the real deal. I lived and breathd Simpson's for 8 years. I had all the DVD's sold from Amazon, bought all the toy's, etc. Matt G. and The SImpson's is now garbage. The shows are not funny and all they care about is pushing their socialist agenda. Do yourself a favor and buy from Amazon the first 7 or 8 season's and enjoy, but the rest of the season's should be ignored. Let Matt G. sit in his fancy home railing on about why war is no good and why we need a socialist agenda but meanwhile, I will be loving every FREEDOM filled day thinking about how good the SImpson's used to be."
4,Still a great show (packaging atrocious),"Same great Simpsons humor! When I read some of the reviews here about the packaging, I thought ""it can't be as bad as I'm imagining it."" Well, it's WORSE -- absolutely the most horrendous packaging concept of any product I've ever encountered.Buy it -- then transfer the discs to some cases that won't make you want to throw the box repeatedly at the wall, stomp upon it, and then take a flamethrower to it."
3,Worst. Packaging. Ever.,"Awkward, annoying, makes the discs incredibly difficult to access without damage, the box has a 3-dimensional Krusty head so it will not fit on a shelf...Who designed this? Ralph Wiggum?At least the annoying 'Homer Head' set had an option for you to send away for a REAL storage box."
3,"OK , I give up , how do I take the discs out without scratching???","I always liked season 11 , my favorite episode is Behind the Laughter , which parodies the VH1 show Behind the Music. However this packing is just... just awful. You might need David Blaine to remove these for you without a scratch. maybe that's their plan , create a box that scratches the discs therefore forcing the consumer to buy it again!!! $$$$$$$$$!!!! I love the episodes but the box is horrible"
3,A bit of a let down...,"I am a huge Simpsons fan, but as I was too young (and too sheltered growing up) my parents would never let me watch the show. So now I own seasons 1-10, and have practically memorized them all. When I purchased season 11, I was just as excited to watch them, but for some reason... I dunno, it's like the season took on a whole new style. I was rather disappointed. I really can't say much more than that, because I don't understand the root of the problem. If you liked the previous seasons, you'll probably enjoy this one, but I don't know if I would buy this again if I had to do it over."
4,"A Four Star Season, with One Star Packaging...","The content of The Simpson's Eleventh year on the air is open to debate. Was this past the show's heyday? Probably. Did this season still manage a ton of brilliant moments? For sure. It's the Simpsons, you know the show and you know you want this set. It's totally worth the price of admission. The only negative is that the makers of these DVD sets can't seem to get the gosh darn diddly correct or uniform. In this release, They've gone to stiff cardboard sleeves to slide your discs into. Lame, crappy, cheap, and scratchy. I assume this is to make the packaging more ""green."", although I suspect that it is also cheaper to manufacture thus making the studio more ""green"" as well. What's wrong with the packaging everyone else is using? Four stars for content, but one star for the lame packaging."
5,the best book for new unix users,"I collect unix books, close to 300. This is the best book for beginners in unix, it actually shows a beginner how to install (the only beginner book that does this) 2 flavors of unix, sun solaris and sco's unix. the chapters are short and to the point. errors are nearly non-existent. If you are serious about learning solaris, then start with this one and go straight to answer2book, the solaris documentation set that comes with the operating system. You can easily multi-boot solaris with all the windows flavors as well as ms-dos. Mark Sobell's book is also an excellent source."
4,That's what I am looking for......,"I was so suprised when i saw this watch, beacause that is so perfect just like what i always expected---a Timex! Unfortunately, I come form China and live there too, I am not sure how can I get it without credit card (is there any other paypal without credit card?), beacause I don't have one yet, but I am sure I will, maybe couple days later."
5,Practical Resource for parents of two or more,"Highly recommended read. Good theory, examples and quick review notes to implement. I'm happy I purchased this one for my iPad, I borrow a lot of parenting books from our local library, but I'm glad to have this one for future reference. Spans many stages and age levels (even into adulthood)."
5,A very helpful tool in dealing with your kids,"This book was EXACTLY what I was looking for. In dealing with my two stepsons as well as my own two daughters, ranging in age from one to seven, I felt there HAD to be a way to prevent some of this fierce competitive and unkind nature between kids. I refused to believe there was nothing much we parents could do about it. The perspective it gave in how to treat the children each as individuals, without reference or comparison to their siblings in any way seemed obvious, yet for most of us parents, we do these things unconsciously in various daily situations. I began realizing how even the smallest comments, however well-intended, could induce rivalry between the kids and have found the ideas and suggestions in this book to be of immeasurable value to my family. In some areas, I do feel that it gets a little too extreme to be realistic, however, the main concept behind the advice and suggestions is very helpful."
4,god advice,"This book provides good, simple advice and interesting case studies that provide good examples of how to use the advice."
1,anecdotal and tedious,"I ordered this book after reading all the great reviews about it. i was immensely disappointed. i find the book hard to follow, full of irrelevant anecdotes and stories, and childish rhetoric. i seriously found nothing useful about it."
2,"Some good information, but condescending","The authors feel you're too stupid to learn from actually reading something. No, they feel you'll learn best by reading a friggin' comic strip of parents and kids talking. I finished the book because I paid money for it, but the whole time I felt as if the authors have high opinions of themselves, and not so much of an opinion for all others."
5,as an only child...,"...this book really helped me not only feel more prepared to handle my two kids, but also helped me understand some of the dynamics in my husband's family.It builds on the active listening skills I am trying to master from their ""how to talk.."" book, plus other books like Parent effectiveness Training that promote a more sensative, less punishing approach to parenting.The format is great, the comics really summarize the points of each chapter well and I want to photocopy them to have them handy."
2,Sounds good but...,"This book is by the same people who wrote How to Talk So Kids Will Listen... It offers practical advice which sounds so reasonable but didn't really help my family when put into use. My girls are almost 9 and 5 1/2. They fight and compete constantly for my attention. I diligently tried the advice in this book but to not avail. Just didn't translate to real life, or maybe its just us!"
5,easy read - well worth it,"Our pediatrician recommended this book to me when I told him about some challenges our toddler was having with the new baby. The book is geared toward slightly older siblings than our kids are now, but was a very quick read, with good down-to-earth language, example situations, and guidance that I can very much imagine revisiting again and again as the kids grow."
5,"Wow, why didn't I think of that?","This is hands down the most helpful parenting book I have read. It will not only help you understand why you may have experienced rivalry with your own siblings, it will help you prevent these same issues from injuring your own childrens' bonds. The authors use support group participants' real-life examples to discuss how we, as parents, unknowingly label our children (He's our athlete, she's our artist, etc.), create unfair comparisons (Your sister ate all of her vegetables, your brother made an ""A"", etc.), become the referee in disputes rather than facilitating problem-solving, and many more. Unlike many other parenting books available, this will leave you with specific guidelines and ideas that you can actually use and receive immediate results."
4,Look here for some answers,"This book is well written and presented in a manner that provides simple, common sense approaches to the anarchy in your home. Many of the scenarios described in the ""sessions"" could be happening in your very own homes, and instead of pulling your hair out in frustration you could be making an effort to learn alternate means of conflict resolution. I read this book and saw myself or my mother (mostly my mother, of course! :)) in most of the situations where an action or phrase would only serve to exacerbate conflict. Especially useful for those parents who are afraid of showing favoritism or trying ""too hard"" not to."
2,Not as advertised and gets pitted easily,"1. The product description includes ""Made in USA."" It is not. It is made in China--at least according to the box it came in.2. Before buying this product, I looked around the Internet to try to find the weight of stainless steel. At parkers-pantry.com, I found the following in addition to the product description posted at Amazon:Brand: NorproName: Fish PoacherManufacturer SKU: 280Material: 18/10 Stainless Steel.Dimensions/Capacity/Size: 4.5""H x 18.0"".Special Features: Perforated rack insertWarranty: Yes.This is very lightweight metal.4. After using the poacher once, I found the bottom surface became pitted.I would not recommend this product."
5,Wonderful Poacher,Excellent. Just what we needed. Poacher arrived on time and as described. Samlon steaks were delicious. Worth the money and more
5,Lauren's Story,What a wonderful story! I could not put it down and I did not want it to end. This book is for anyone that loves animals!Kay does a remarkable job at expressing her love and adoration for that strange little beagle named Lauren. She also brings to life a culture so different from our own--its incredible fascinating. This is a book that people are sure to remember for years to come!
5,This is a must read for anyone who loves dogs,"I could not stop reading this book and finished it on the day I received it. An emotional and honest story, between Kay and her Beagle Lauren. It will melt the heart of anyone who's had a dog or pet they cared about.This is a book for dog lovers. Well written, beautiful and heart warming. This is a must read for anyone who loves dogs."
1,Romance Addicts Only!,"If you're a fan of Romantic fiction, fine, but don't buy the hype. This is not a fresh, new re-interpretation of Camelot. Its a tired, unconvincing account that gives Guinivere the feelings and attitudes of a contemporary woman."
1,Same As S. Pearlman,same thing happened to me as the review S. Pearlman left above me then i just opened it so i cant get a refund and i was better off goin 2 my local skate shop and getting a Blind mini DO NOTOTOTOTOTTT BUY FROM FOGDOG!!!!
5,Lost Mountain,This book is critical for understanding the history and ecology of mountaintop renewal; it brings the devastation home in a way that immediately touches you. I'd highly recommend this to anyone interested in environmental issues; my only complaint is that the book should have been longer - no amount of writing can make up for the horrors Reece exposes.Alan Sondheim
4,GOOD OLD WESTERN,"This classic western was copyrighted way back in 1953, and generally follows the western genre of the time. Protagonist Dan Harland is the ""white hat"", and there are tons of bad guys and gals. Dan can't figure out if he enjoys being a gunfighter for hire or an average man with good morals and intentions. I really enjoyed reading it, but miss the more real ""sex and blood"" of the modern novels, i.e., western, adventure, romance, and action that we have today. I found my used copy buried away in a tiny book store in Idaho. That copy has already made its way to Guam. If you find a copy again, go for it. A good read."
5,Gives you new perspective.,"This book was well written. Though evangelizing is not a formula made event, Simpson gives new perspective on how we should evangelize in This Modern Time."
2,Waste Of Words,"According to the author, he got the idea to write this book by reading a marketing strategy guide called ""Permission Marketing"". If you read ""Permission Evangelism"", you will soon find that this book is simply a repackaging of the same basic message with Christian lingo and cliches added.The most valuable thing about this book is that it secondarily serves as a great guide to marketing. This certainly can help evangelical Christians to know how to more sensitively and lovingly portray the Gospel to a post-modern western audience.In the end however, it just made me want to read ""Permission Marketing"", the book he copied and put a Christian message into. That way, I could glean more of what's actually valuable in the book with all the Christian cliches set aside.This book is a waste of words. I'm going to go mourn for all the sad souls who have spent time it now... including my own."
3,Not What I Remember,"I had this CD years ago and it got lost in the shuffle. I bought another copy and I can say it is not the same. Some songs are missing, and there are some new ones that I am not particularly fond of. Its pretty good overall, but this version doesnt even have ""Gonna Fly Now."" Its blasphemy I tell you. Be aware of what you are buying, this version is different."
4,almost as inspiring as the movie,"I enjoyed the music from Rocky IV. The Training Montage, War, and No Easy Way Out a great deal. Living In America was FANTASTIC. The other songs on the disc were fine, but those four formed a great loop in my head. When I'm doing something physical I'll mentally replay them and they provide a great pick me up. I'd recommend this to any Rocky fan, and also to anyone looking to find great music for a workout."
4,Brasil's Godfather of Soul,"Although he was very popular and had a successful career in Brasil, unfortunately Tim Maia never had quite the crossover success that other Brazilian artists, such as Antonio Carlos Jobim (Tom Jobim), Astrud Gilberto, and others had abroad. However this does not reflect on his level of talent. He is truly one of Brasil's greatest Soul gems of the 70's. Tim Maia began his singing career in the United States in the early 60's, where he learned English and studied American Soul/R&B music. Upon returning to Brasil he incorporated all the soulful elements of American R&B music into his own work. The result: A creative blend of R&B-Soul-Funk-Disco-Samba. Hearing this album you will be able to hear all the influences of great American Soul/R&B artists from the 60's & 70's, such as James Brown, Earth, Wind & Fire, The Commodres, and Kool & The Gang....Just to name a few. Tim Maia also has a warm voice that is guaranteed to lift your spirits!"
3,"Not All Winners, But An Enjoyable Listen","I have no idea what Tim Maia sang about (and was barely understandable in English songs), but O Melhor is a good start into the world of the genre MPB. Not every song is a winner in this album, but ""Gostava"" is a terribly addicting, smooth song and ""O Descobridor"" is a very upbeat song that is funky, dance friendly, and would be 10x better if produced in a modern studio. The album ""Som Livre"" would be a better purchase, as more of the tracks are more listenable and the album's tenor is more consistent."
2,Poor track selection,"There is too much disco sound and too less bossa nova in this poor track selection. Tim Maia is much more than this mediocre edition. I didn't find here anything of his always enjoyable funky, jazzy and brazilian style performances."
4,Skip the first five songs...,"...they are hokey Asian rock that make Westerners cringe. The real music on this the cd is beautiful Kroncong, which starts on track 7 and continues to the end. Indonesian youth call this music ""nostolgic"", but you will find the sounds lovely, dignified, and refreshing. These last 40 minutes of music make the cd worth it."
2,Extremely Dated...,"When I bought this (used on Amazon) I knew this was a book published quite some time ago and therefore would not be completely up to date, but honestly the directions and photos in this book are really quite poor."
1,yoga in denial,"What do I say about someone who indulges in denail of yoga's greatness and tries to popularise it. The author has no understanding of yoga's roots, its philosophy and spirituality. Here are a list of things she might advocate:Dont breathe because breathing in yoga is about prana and there is whole theory associated with prana and pagan Gods.Dont say Om because it is representation of Brahma, Vishnu and Iswara-the trinity of Hindu Gods.Dont practise yoga because the primary purpose of yoga is to achieve Iswara - the Hindu God.But then again, the author's yoga has nothing to do with philosophy and spirituality and Hinduism. In fact, it is plain simple exercises which man has know for ever and the west has always been practising.Then what the heck is the word yoga doing there? - it's anybody's guess.Peace."
3,Sizing chart does not match the sizes listed.,"I don't know where else to ask this, but hope this gets through. The sizing chart reflects numbers, while the sizes listed are letters. What can I do? I can't order that. Can you fix it? Thanks!"
2,"Nowhere near as great as ""HELLUCINATE""","I was very dissapointed with this release. After discovering this band only a couple months ago with ""Hellucinate"", I was expecting an unrelenting and ferocious new cd. While it's not terrible by any means, it just doesn't even compare to ""Hellucinate"". The intensity of this one is nothing compared to the last one, and the songs become monotonous by the end of the disc. If you are new to this band, get ""Hellucinate"" and don't look back."
4,Enjoyable approach to gardening annuals,"James Fenton makes the case for annuals in your garden, which are typically overlooked in gardening writing that concentrates on perennials. This book, which lists 100 of the author's favorite plants to grow from seed, should be read with a plant encyclopedia at hand like as 'Sunset Western Garden', so that you can see what the plants look like and what their care requirements are. Many self-sowing varieties are included, which may convince those looking for a low-maintainence garden that annuals can play a part in it. Color and appeal is emphasized, much like what would have attracted you if you had a chance to garden as a child. The author's garden is in the south of England, which may limit whether his choices are appropriate for your climate."
1,"BAD, BUT...","THIS BOOK DOES GIVE ONE IDEAS ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH THE PUBLISHERS OF THIS ""BOOK"". IT ALL CAME FROM WIKIPEDIA, YOU SEE..."
4,Excellent and Entertaining,"Mark Frost again shows he has his finger on the pulse of American sports history with his marvelous biography of Bobby Jones. This is the first Jones bio I have encountered that looks beyond the championships and The Slam to look at what Bobby went through to acheive such feats. It was especially interesting to see that the Grand Slam was not a series of dominating peformances, and that on at least one occasion (to paraphrase the Duke of Wellington) it was a damn close run thing.While it is roundly recognized that Jones heyday was occured in the Golden Age of American sports, it does seem on occasion that Mr. Frost is overreaching when he starts to go off the track of Bobby Jones' career and heads off to look at the country (as noted in other reviews). I would think that the fact that he received TWO (!) ticker tape parades in NYC is testimony enough to his impact and personality."
3,"Well Researched and Written, Not for Non-Jones Fanatics","Frost does an excellent job of interlacing the time period with Jones' career. However, the play-by-play of every Major tournament Jones played in is quite long-winded, too detailed for my patience (and I'm a huge Bobby fan). For non-golfers, it could be tedious and boring, I would presume.I also found Frost to be overtly negative toward certain golfers of the era, to a fault. No one is perfect and, if you truly study Jones, compassion and tolerance were some of his greatest traits. Frost's negativity at times belies the spirit of Bobby.Otherwise, it is the most detailed account of Bobby's golf career I have ever read, a must for Jones fanatics.If you read one book on Jones, read ""A Golf Story"" by Charles Price."
2,A disappointing effort,"I had very high hopes for this book, but was disappointed by a rather flat, mundane effort. There is nothing new here, and even Frost's idol-worship of Bobby Jones fails to make up for the gap in reporting. Having read many books on Jones (including several of his own), I was hopeful that perhaps Frost would turn up something new, an anecdote, or even some insight. I was disappointed.Even the writing, which Frost demonstrated with such flair in The Greatest Game Ever Played, seems to sag at key moments in the second half of the book.Avoid this one."
5,Enlightened Author,The author of this book is a shining light and her words bring love and healing. The story teaches children to trust in their inner resources and to know that they are always loved and protected wherever they are. When I first read it to my five year old daughter she said it was her favourite story. She looked at the photo on the back and recognized the dog from the story. She decided she knew the dog and loved her. Its a favourite for us at bedtime and it is helping me teach my daughter to trust her own heart and to feel safe in the world.
5,Written for children.... appeal to the child in us all !,"As an adult reading this book, I am so touched by it. It warms my heart. It is a wonderful picture book that I have also given as a gift to a dear friend, whose daughter is 24 months old. She so loves to have it read to her! And she loves to follow along with the colorful artwork.Is a wonderful story to all those who want to introduce a love and appreciation of Nature and the Love of Spirit to their young children....is a lesson to older children of the Love and caring a Mother provides, yet how they can find their own way when necessary....and to young and old alike, a reminder of the Spirit of Nature in all things and how we are a part of it All.Perfect as a gift for your children and friends! Opens discussions about Nature and Love and things ""a Mother would do""!"
2,"The playing is fine, but the recorded sound is dreadful.","This is a very good collection of Debussy piano works, and I recently purchased it from Amazon because of this. Ronan O'Hora's reputation as an excellent interpreter is such that I was happy to find this listed, but the sound quality is so poor as to render the fine playing here somewhat inconsequential. My advice would be to opt for the Zoltan Kocsis collection on the Philips label."
1,Poor,"Bad situation with dealer.I ordered the item, it came timely. The battery did not hold a charge, seemed shoddily put together, and didn't work at all. I utilized the company's help line and they informed me if I paid shipping to send it back, they'd give me a new battery. They never sent the new battery and when I called they said they never received my return even when the shipping number confirmed delivery. I was not happy.I recommend a different vendor."
1,Not what I expected,"I have never written a review before but just had to this time. As I disabled parent of three children for many years, I know of what I speak. And, this book is just weird. I don't know any other way to describe it. I threw it in the trash."
5,great toy,My Yellow lab loves this toy. She usually chews toys up but this one is still going strong. The squeeker is very a loud but she loves it.
2,Disappointing,"My Lab loved it at first bite, but in less than a month the squeaker stopped squeaking."
3,"Fun toy, but too easy","Good size, great noise, a real favorite of our dogs, who aren't real destroyers of this kind of toy. Didn't last a week, however, as one of our dogs was able to chew the end cap off, rendering it subsequently useless. Wouldn't buy it again as I'd expect the same thing to happen again."
3,"Great toy, need something with greater strength","I have a bullmastiff and a bulldog so I realize I was expecting too much when I bought this toy for them. My bulldog loves to fetch and this toy is great for fetching. My only gripe is that it's the same material used to make tennis balls so it doesn't take much abuse. My bullmastiff tore it apart in 30 seconds flat. Very good toy for fetchers, not chewers."
2,Poor squeaker,This would be a great toy if the squeaker would only last longer than one day. This is a problem with this entire line of squeaker toys.
3,"Dog loves it, but it had a short life",We have a 2 year old 20lb fox terrier that loves squeaking toys. He had the squeaker dislodged in less than an hour. The felt cover was half gone by the following day. He still loves what's left. This dog toy is far from durable if your dog enjoys destroying tennis balls and their ilk.
2,Sqeaker gone in minutes,"Not only did my lab mix dislodge the squeaker in minutes, she ripped the entire felt cover off within a day. Disappointed overall, she loved it for the first day. Just not durable."
1,Poor quality,I was mislead by the KONG name and my Shih-tzu first destroyed the squeaker which he almost ate and then the coating started to peal off. Junk.
2,Not really a true Kong's toy...,"My 50# German sheppard loves this toy, but... the squeaker only last 5 minutes - I am pretty sure he ate it. The rest last for another month or so. I refuse to buy it again because I am afraid he will eat the squeaker again."
2,"Good shipping, actually book is questionable.","Everything from shipping to packing was great. The biggest question was about the actual book though, the pages are very easily ripped out. Obvious fault of the publisher."
1,luring of the bees,i reall had hoped for a swarm of bees to pllinate my veggies this year i set out 2 of these lures in a 20 ft space and waited and waited and waited months went by and no bees just now as the season is turning cold i got 2 loyal bees that show up every day but it is too late no good can come from this i will not use these next year
1,This Book Is Not Good For Students,"This book only suitable for someone who has already had the idea of programming VHDL. It mentions only the syntax of single instructions, and lacks example circuits to simulate. The author seems don't know that students are not familiar with VHDL programming structure and need more examples to follow. After reading the whole book, I still could not succeed in compliling my VHDL scripts, and waste my time in reading error messages on VHDL simulator. Finally, I duscarded the book and bought ""VHDL for Programmable Logic"" as my textbook, which helps me alot but mentions little testbench programming."
2,"Only syntax, use as a reference not as a first text on VHDL","This book can only be used as a reference. It describes the syntax of VHDL but does not really explain its semantics through examples. If you have never used VHDL, this book will not help you that much -- it is not met for a beginner."
2,let the rating be your judge,"A competent text for VHDL language & syntax, but not intended for hardware design. One is expected to have some design background upon using this text. Therefore, the text should have been titled as a ""Syntax Guide to VHDL.""Good price, but so little to offer. My advice is to buy the ""Designer's Guide to VHDL."" I ended up getting this textbook to use as reference after using the student version (I sold the student version back). It is the exact same textbook with extra added feature...kinda like the Toyota Camry DLX version of the Camry platform!Overall, there are other textbooks better than Ashenden's....ones that have more design-based examples such as a system arbiter or floppy disk controller. Earlier reviews are correct but a bit harsh.Try VHDL Primer by J. Bhjasker. Bhasker is an IEEE chair of the HDL Interoperability Group and would an authoritative voice in the HDL community.Good luck and happy reading!"
1,A total waste of $30,"This text book failed in its attempt to teach VHDL to students. A very futile effort. I wasted monetary resource for something that I did not benefit from. After reading through text, I was utterly digusted that all I learned was the VHDL syntax, but NO REAL APPLICATION presented. My honest feeling is that I was ripped-off.My advice to the one who wishes to buy this book is NOT TO BUY THIS BOOK. If you don't believe me, read the other people who also commented on buying this book. Better yet, buy the book and suffer the same as I did."
1,Confusion compliments the title of the book,"I wanted to learn VHDL so I took the initiative of buying this book since the it was a ""student's"" version. I thought that it would lay a strong foundation in VHDL. It turned out that this was merely a syntax guide!!! Examples were okay, but more real-world examples would have been preferred. I agree that this book is ""not worth the price"" for any beginner in VHDL since it would probably bring confusion rather than knowledge. I am still in search for a better text...one which will imprt a good, sound knowledge in VHDL -- caveat emptor."
2,not worth the price,"I purchased this book for because it was recommended by our instructor. At first, it was an interesting text, but as I progressed on reading, frustration came along. His examples are alright, but a more realistic and graphical example would have been preferred. I think that there are other texts that would is FAR BETTER than this one!"
1,"should be titled as ""The SYNTAX Guide to VHDL""","This was the required book for our VHDL class in EE. Many bought it and have discovered that it was very dry, boring, and somewhat disorganized--a big disappointment. In plain words, IT STINKS (as all of my colleagues agreed)! Its an inexpensive version of ""The Designer's Guide to VHDL.""If you really want to learn VHDL, I recommend ""VHDL for Programmble Logic"" by Kevin Skahill--100x better. I bought it and have no regret of the purchase--a great investment."
5,Baby loves it!,My 9-month old daughter LOVES this book! This is also how she learned to give kisses! Now we all get kisses!
2,A mistake,"I originally wrote a good review but after 6 months of frustration I must ammend it. The unit is quiet. When working, it does a good job but the small bag doesn't even get 1/4 full and the vac shuts down. I would vacuum for about 10 minutes and it would stop. I'd leave it off for a few minutes and it would start back up, then shut down. I changed bags, it would work for another 10 minutes and shut down. And this is on bare floors. Not heavy carpet. I have pet hair more than dirt so maybe the pet hair makes the machine sense the bag is full. At any rate it is in the repair shop to see if there is something they can do. The repair shop says they get a lot of problems with these units. I am ordering a Miele today and will just use this unit as a spare if it ever works. My recommendation: it's not worth the money and definately don't get it if you have pet hair."
1,Don't even think about it,"The first five reviewers must have been paid off by the company, do not, I repeat DO NOT buy this vacuum. I have had this thing for 5 months, and it has worked for maybe 1 month. I have already had to buy a second vacuum for when this one does not work. The power head turns off whenever it wants, and now the entire machine turns off. It's been to the service center three times.....not fixed. It is not even really an Electrolux, it's just an overpriced Eureka...they bought the name apparently. I'm eating my 400 bucks and taking a slegehammer to this piece of junk!!!!"
2,"Okay, I suppose","I have generally been quite pleased with Ian Hogg's books. His German Handguns book is quite good and informative. This one, however, leaves a lot to be desired.The layout is reasonably good (if a little too much like an elementary school textbook), with a description of each item on one page, and a photo of the item and its cartridge on the facing page. However, that is pretty much where my praise ends. While no book can be comprehensive, this one doesn't even try. There are HUGE gaps in the handguns covered. Some non-military curios are listed, while fairly common handguns are missed entirely. Even the ones that are covered lack significant information like exactly what type of cartridge they use, years manufactured, countries that used it, etc.Overall, this book was something of a disapointment."
1,Another flunking grade for Ian Hogg,"Unlike the other reviewer, I've never read a good book by Hogg. I didn't buy it, I checked it out from the Library. Good thing. Don't waste your money or time. There are HUNDREDS of better books on the market or do an internet search for handgun and you'll come up with better stuff. This guy is a hack."
2,Two quite poor westerns,"It is difficult to understand if we really have seen the same films. Rimfire is a typical B-westerns which I could stand, but Little Big Horn has all the cavalry clichés like fighting officers etc. I am rooting for indians at present so I was happy that the message did not get through - which would have been against the reality. If this gets five stars, John Ford trilogy must get at least 20 each."
1,too old,These real old B&W B movies are not any good. I receive it in good shape and on time as promised but I still didn't like it.
4,Excellent Cookbook,"Everyone in LA (that's Lower Alabama) was raving about this cookbook at a recent party I attended, so I decided to track it down. Seller (susanc53) had a very fair price on the item and got it to me in excellent time and great condition. I am no expert chef, but the recipes look achievable and tasty."
4,Great Reference!,"This publication has been my ""Hikers Bible"" for many years now. As some of you already know, there is not much information out there on this subject. Craig Martin has created a concise, easy to read list of places to the footpaths of New Mexico. Complete with maps and photos. A book I keep in my car!"
5,"Unbelievably funny, sad and true.","The Beetle is an entertaining short film about a man and his love of an old car. In this movie, the film maker is deciding if he should listen to his pregnant wife and sell the car or to spend more money than it is worth to fix it. He interviews past owners and they tell the car's life story. The stories are humorous and touching on how the car has played a role in many people's lives. Once again the car is involved in the life of someone. This time it is a man torn between husband and fatherly responsibilities and his last chance for independence, and to save the car he loves."
5,No issues...,I ordered this turn signal after breaking my old one when dropped my 2002 Kawasaki Ninja 250R on its side. It fits like a glove with no installation issues. Great replacement product.
3,What no small sizes?,What about those of us that have smaller feet? This is the first I have seen that there are no size6?? I would love to buy these but a 7 is too big!
4,Good for the money,"Still not a silver bullet - I've found brands of RWs and DLs it doesn't like, but very fast and accurate. SATA cuts down on the ""hang time"" after inserting a disc."
3,Sneak Attack,"the only problem I have with this product is the company that runs it. It isn't enough that you buy one, no they send you free trials until you threaten to bring a law suit against them for harrassment. So watch out for that."
2,Disappointment :(,"I ordered this tape for my dad who loves his old movies and was so excited to receive this as a surprise! Unfortunately, it was scratchy, jumpy and the sound was bad."
1,Stick to the truth,"There are plenty of real Bushisms to use.Filling this one with occasional fakes among the real, is boring and useless. Makes it not the joke I wanted to see.Go back and make a real one, not that I'd buy anything they published again ...."
1,Possibly the worst book in the series,"This book lacks most of what made the series outstanding (the illustrations, however are at least as good as usual). Stock characters make routine appearances, in two cases acting quite unlike they do in other books. There's almost no plot: unbelievably Freddy steals a huge sum of money, is taken to trial, and let off with a warning.There are few laughs, and little wordplay. Poems, never Brooks' strong point, take up several pages -- the reader is even forced to read a several page discussion about writing poetry.Certainly don't start the series with this one. Consider avoiding it entirely."
1,Very bad!!!,"You don't get what you see on the website! I ordered a new Sharp cartridge, but received a re-manufacutered version of some unknown brand.Sharp UX-C70B Black Ink Cartridge (UX-B700 Fax)"
1,Will dry out if not used! Expensive to repalce,I've installed my new cartridge about 6 months ago and have printed less than 20 pages. Now it appears to be dried out even though there is no indication that I've run out of ink. I've followed the instructions for cleaning the cartridge without any noticeable improvement. To get a new Sharp cartridge will cost me more than I've paid for the FAX machine itself.
1,Bad Choice,"Don't believe everything you read! This is listed as NEW but came in as RECONDITIONED (refilled). You get your money back and lots of E-mails wanting you to buy directly from the supplier, but why waste time and still have to order again? If you want a refil, go on to Cartridge World--they have always done a decent job for me."
1,thanks for the dried-out cartridge suggestion!,"Having previously replaced a couple of cartridges that dried out on my Sharp UX-B20 fax, I've been pretty good about making a copy with the fax every few weeks to prevent the problem from recurring. But it happened once again--and the manual's instructions to wipe the cartridge and run the cleaning sequence didn't help. I got the cartridge to work by soaking the contacts at the bottom end of the cartridge in 1/8 inch of distilled water and then wrapping the end in a wet cloth and smacking it against my hand (don't know if the latter step was important, but it didn't seem to hurt). I'm grateful to the reviewers who suggested these measures. You've saved me--and probably a lot of others--a lot of money."
1,Not the real deal!,"I thought I was ordering the Sharp product but I received a ""generic"" instead. I consider this false advertising and I would hope that Amazon would do something about it."
1,Empty cartridges!,We bought two cartridges and one was empty. We are so not satisfied with this vendor!
1,Poor quality of product,No ink came out of the cartridge. Tried everything. Perhaps it's an old product. Too bad I'm not able to return the item.
4,super,"so glad i could still get this ink cartridge. i think my machine has been discontinued for some time. i found one locally, but i was able to order two for less than the price of one. they shipped really quickly, got them sooner than they estimated."
2,Leaky cartridge,"The cartridge was obviously leaky as soon as I opened the plastic wrapping. Fortunately I was in a position to wash my hands immediately, or I would have been stained for days. So I had to return it, and dealing with Amazon return is no fun. The return process is confusing at best. When I finally got to the part where I could ship via UPS, the program to pull up a list of local stations wasn't working. I will buy it locally from now on. At least then if there are problems I know where to go."
3,"It's OK, But Can Dry Out","We use the Sharp UX-C70B Ink Cartridge in ourSharp UXB20 Inkjet Fax Machine. This cartridge is required if you are using the Sharp FAX machine and I have not found a generic that will work.The cartridge performs OK if you use it regularly, but is prone to clogging and drying out if it goes for a week or so without being used. Most of the time this problem can be resolved by removing the cartridge from the machine and gently wiping the print head area with a damp paper towel.This is not a great cartridge, but it is the only option if you are using a Sharp Fax machine.CFH"
2,VERTICAL LINES SHOW UP ONCE COPY IS PRINTING,"In ref. to the ""Sharp UX-C70B Black Ink Cartridge"" I ordered for my fax machine, I was disappointed that 5 vertical lines showed up on the far right side of each copy I printed."
1,KevB Nailed the review of this product,"KevB reported, ""If used only occasionally in a home fax machine to print out confirmations, it will likely dry out before it ""runs"" out. There are no viable lower-priced alternatives. Avoid re-manufactured cartridges as they do not perform well at all.""Gem"
1,Sharp UX-C70B Black Ink Cartridge,"This product has a lifespan of about one week. Either the cartridges are only partially filled (very small to begin with), or the ink solidifies when air hits it. Lousy deal."
1,Something old and something new,"Ok, hard rock, meets pink floyd, meets the the munsters theme? Think Teacher leave those kids alone, meets metal in their hit "" She is the new thing""Or try this bum bum bum bum bum, bum bum bum bum bum.... the backbeat to Count in Fives....been done so many times. Every song has a super repitive beat, and is almost comical with their funny voices. I don't know whether to laugh or dance? All of their music is a horrible stolen 50's monster movie music theme....it's laughable. It's funny, but I am not sure it's creative or interesting. All the songs sound the same to me! It just doesn't do it for me."
5,Strange And Lovely,I bought this album on a whim. I heard a few of their songs via myspace and saw that NYLON magazine and even Teen Vogue (what the hell?) was developing a sick obsession for their unique look.But listening to the album as a whole was a totally different experience. It's one of the first cohesively sounding albums I've heard in a while. It just makes sense. The songs compliment each other. The style has so much integrity and it's just down right smack you in the face scary eerie garage rock goodness. It does everything you want it to do and it also makes me want to punch someone in the face... I love it so much... you will too.
2,Listen to the Real Thing Instead,"Although this is a better alternative to ""Emo"" and ""Happy"" punk for the younger generations, you should listen to the band whose sound these guys are trying so bad to emulate: The Birthday Party. Get ""Hits"" by the immortal and immoral BP and you'll see exactly what I mean. One star for having Bad Seed/Grinderman extraodinaire Jim Sclavunos as a producer and one star for having the guts to have inlfuences like The Birthday Party in these dark agesHits."
2,Not bad if you weren't alive in the mid 70's,"Sounds like a cross between Iggy Pop, New York Dolls, Simple Minds of the 80's and an ""edgier"" Flock of Seagulls."
5,"Nitis ROMANCES Statistical Inference. Excellent Alternative to Hogg, McKean, Craig","I have recently begun reading this book alongside the assigned text (Hogg, Mckean, Craig) for an intro to statistical theory course.Both are terrific texts but this book really shines with its nonmathematical touches. In most chapters, Nitis romances the topic with a bit of history, examples, and enthusiasm. Such warm up is absent from other texts resulting in a mechanical and disappointingly unsatisfying experience. By putting students in the ""mood"" the Nitis text ensures that students will come back for more."
5,Product Review,"This a very good book for mathematical statistics. I purchased it from amazon at a reasonable price, the packaging was too good..I got it perfect shape and have been using it ever since!"
4,a very good book,"I thought this book was exciting. My favorite part was when the characters were in the caves. I was disappointed in the ending because it left me ""hanging""."
2,Not so great,"If you're an 11 year old girl who likes adventure and fantasy, you'd like this, right? WRONG! This is extremely strange and out of the ordinary. The only reason I read it was because I needed to make a book report."
3,"A little bland, especially if you're Chinese...","Whenever I read Yep, I think, yep, this is sure good! But I didn't really like Thorn- for one thing, most human heroes would have done what he did-and the Chinese lore had some mistakes-for one thing, Chinese dragons use magic to fly, not wings!(They don't have wings, either.) And their pearls are in their mouths...and they can turn into clouds to rain water...and Shimmer doesn't sound like a Chinese name. And Monkey King's master was not born old! Nor was he called the Old Boy. IF you are looking for a book that's just a little above average,that's slightly bland, with average characters, average boring writing style and great plot ruined by not enough hmmmmm, work, care, then this is it. If you are looking for a book that is deep, thoughtful, and relates to you and manages to be an engrossing story,too, then check out Dragonwings, Child of the Owl, and Thief of Hearts. Not this."
3,Worth Reading,"Dragon of the Lost Sea is, ultimately, nothing more than a quest adventure, but it is elevated by its surprisingly lovely, elegant writing, and distinguished by a Chinese flavour.If you enjoyed this, but would like something more grownup/meatier/cleverer/funnier, definitely check out Barry Hughart's ""Bridge of Birds"" for a more rollicking adventure in a never-never China, an absolutely terrific book.Note: 3 stars, for me, is a pretty good review, 4 is for extremely distinguished works, and 5 only for those I consider classics. Most of what is published is, unfortunately, a 2 or less."
4,Good Value for the money,"For my dollar, this pizzelle baker was definitely worth it. It bakes the pizzelles very evenly, does not require any non-stick spray or anything like that, and it cleans up in a snap!I would still like to know what I have to do to pour exactly the right amount of batter & where to place it to get a perfect pizzelle every time. It would also be nice if there were a signal to let you know when it's done.Bottom line, if you don't want to spend a fortune, and you like pizzelles, I highly recommend the VillaWare V3600-NS PREGO Pizzelle Baker !"
5,Great Pizzelle Baker,This is actually my second purchase of this same baker. I have had the other for a few years and decided I needed to up my production capabilities. Love the nonstick aspect; it cleans up easily.I don't use the recipe that comes with the baker.
4,Not bad,"This is the first pizzelle maker I've ever purchased. The machine works great. The handles flex a little too much. This was disconcerting to me. Otherwise, the machine worked good, I made great pizzelles, everyone loved them. The recipes in the instruction book were good. For the price I paid,$42,I'm pleased with my purchase. I would recommend this pizzelle maker. Since this is the only pizzelle maker I have experienced, I did not give it five stars."
5,non stick pizzelle baker,I had this item sent to my daughter in another state and she is absolutly happy with it. Thank U very much.
5,At last i found it!,"I've been getting Pizzelle cookies for Christmas from my aunt and I look forward to them every year. She informed me last year that her pizzelle maker broke down, and she can't find one anywhere. Thank God i found one on your website! Not only did i buy one, i sent the information to my other aunt who also bought one. We both love the pizzelle maker, it works great,and i would reccomend it to everyone. I recieved it in a few short days,and i love it!"
3,Not as expected,"I'm sure this product is good as I do own a larger version of this pizzelle maker, but it is smaller then I thought it would be."
4,Really enjoy,"once i recieved this product, i waited for my son to get home from college and we made our pizelles while on thanksgiving break, we really enjoy it, once we got the hang of how much batter to use, it worked great. i would recommend this product."
4,Shawnee Through Anglo Eyes,"Trowbridge makes a valid attempt at recording his experiences and his observations of the Shawnee people while living among them. Because they were living in the Southern and Central part of Ohio, this record provides an interesting window into the world of the Shawnee after increased contact with whites who were infringing on the treaties which prescribed that no whites should cross the Ohio River.His orthography and vocabulary are very helpful for the serious student of Shawnee past. His descriptions of dances also stand quite revealing. Historically, the effort appears valid as well.I recommend this text for students who are doing serious research in the Shawnee history, culture and/or language. It is out of print and hard to find."
4,This book is Good,Chirlie Daniels is the only writer that can capture my attention. I feel this is the best book I've ever read. I would tell anyone to read it.
1,Yikes,"I love how the far right bashes the heck out of Hollywood for having ""liberal"" political opinions, yet Charlie Daniels can whine about how liberals are ruining the world. No one raises their voice about Mr. Daniel's wacked Fox-News political rants; they give em a book deal!!!"
2,"After Reading this book, some thoughts strike me...","At first, after finishing the last page, I thought ""only an idiot would read this book."" After much reflexion however, I'd have to say ""only an idiot would buy this book.""I've served my country, voted in every election I could, voting my heart and mind, which has sent me from right to left to (where I belong) center. I deeply love and care about my country, but Mr. Daniels has an uncanny ability in his writing to make me wish to move- the day the country of Lincoln, Washington, Jefferson and Franklin needs Mr. Daniels half-baked screed, it's time to examine our society. It's sad to think that in a country that produced writers from Twain to James Thurber, and whose current crop of young writers is flourishing, someone chose to give this yahoo another podium. Don't waste your money."
4,Best shampoo for pet stains I have found,Is it perfect on all pet stains...no... but unfortuately pet stains are tough and it is by far the best pet stain shampoo I have found. The smell isn't overbearing. It doesn't seal the stain into the carpet which many shampoos do. I'm very pleased with the shampoo and it is the only shampoo I currently use.
4,Nastalgia in a shoebox...,I saw these 'stars' on Amazon the other day and had to order them. I was immediately transported back to junior high in 1974. Levi's and Converse All Stars were the rage. I wore them while listening to Sweet Home Alabama and Black Water on the radio. $39.95 is a small price to pay to own a piece of history. I think they were $12.99 back in '74.
2,Nice looking but....,The silver necklace looks very nice and sturdy so I got it for my husband to wear a Celtic cross on. The first time he took it off over his head it broke at the clasp. Not very happy.
2,"If you know Portuguese, it's vulgar!","This group was popular from 1994-1996. They died in a tragic plane crash. This ended the career of Mamonas Assassinas whose music was bright and cheery--sometimes comical, but always vulgar. One of their most popular songs includes a reference to the male genitilia and a catchy phrase taken from an anti-AIDS campaign.To the unaided American ear (non-Portuguese speaking) the music and beat did have a way to capture popular Brazilian pop! But keep it away from the ""criancinhas."""
2,Disappointed by quality,"These were great out of the package -- very thick, well designed, and extremely warm. However, after just two month's wear and washing (in accordance with the directions of course - turned inside out, cold water, delicate cycle), both the top and the bottom are pilled like crazy, especially along the seams which are, to my distress, starting to unravel.Pilling I'm okay with, but total seam failure I'm definitely not. Since these only come with a 30 day manufacturer's warranty, I was stuck at 60 days with no recourse and a pair of wool wear that probably only has another month's lifespan. I expect a $140 baselayer set to last more than a couple of months. This is the last time I'm ever buying ""Made in China"" apparel.Perhaps the set I purchased was somehow a fluke, since other reviewers here are satisfied, but I wanted to share my experience in the interest of helping other shoppers."
5,Soft and warm,"These bottoms are really soft and warm, but they run large. I usually buy medium's in pants, and they were too large. So, I went to a small, and they were too big. I exchanged them for an xs, and I'm hoping that they fit!"
4,Vicente Amigo - Un momento en el sonido,"I admire Vicente Amigo a lot since I heard him playing about four years ago. Although he is not already as big as Paco de Lucía, I think he will be soon.I prefer slow ""toques"" in flamenco and cut #3 (Mezquita-soleá) is really beautiful. It includes major ends when ending the main theme then turning to minor which make this soleá really special.Cut #4 (Tangos del arco bajo-tangos) is also beautiful. Including the bandoneón in some cuts like ""Un momento en e sonido"" (taranta) is also very interesting. Combination of his guitar, percussion and bandoneón is colorful and they complement very well each other."
2,Not to impressed,Works about a third of the time. I have gone back to measuring the old fashion way (finger on the neck.)
3,Good for morning resting heart rate results,This device is a simple and fairly accurate way to measure your heart rate. I use it to determine my resting heart rate in the morning and at various times throughout the day. It is sensitive to movement and therefore sometimes produces erroneous results. For this reason I would not recommend it to determine your heart rate while exercising. For accuracy I take my heart rate 2 or 3 times. You can't beat the price but I wish it was backlit.
5,Accurate and Simple,No chest straps... just place your thumb on the monitor and get a heart rate!!!I can wear this monitor around my neck or wrist and get an accurate heart rate in 2 seconds.I have no trouble whether I am biking or doing elliptic regardless of how much I've been sweating.I cannot get a reading from 98% of the machines at my gym. I tried to use a Reebok strapless wristwatch monitor (trying to put two fingertips on either side of the face) and had to wait about two minutes for a reading.
3,nice and easy,for the price its not bad. its very simple to use. that's what I wanted. its also pretty accurite as long as you don't move around too much. It works well for me. If you want something that's inexpensive and works rather well then this is the one for you.
1,This device made my heart stop,"No! Do not buy this product. I completely wasted my money on it and it has never consistently worked since the first day I got it.I bought this to wear around my neck for taking my heart rate during jumproping or spinning. It seemed like a great concept, but it never worked since I opened the package. I cannot return it now, because I should have called Amazon right away, but I made the mistake of putting it in the drawer out of frustration.I even read the directions with my aerobics instructor, and she could not get it to work. She said she just uses her watch and I looked at her and laughed!The good old fashioned way of checking our heart rate is the best, and I should have saved my $20.00 instead.Don't buy this product unless you want to waste your money."
2,Not very accurate,"This hr monitor doesnt work to well, Im on here shopping for another one. It gives awkward readings.For example When I was walking trying to get 120heart rate, I place my index finger where Im supposed to, it reads 93 and the all of a sudden 189??!?!?hats not all it does. You can be sitting doing nothing and it gives you 2 or 3 different readings which are way off. Sometimes it works ok, but thats rarely.It gives many errors too.Not well spent money, sorry."
1,heart monitor,of little or no use - much to difficult to use when you are excercising - i find this product totally unacceptable
3,Probably worth the money,It does read your heart rate but is not very consistant. Try it many times and never get a number that comes close to the last reading.
1,not a healthy tea.,"I ordered what I thought was matcha tea powder. a comment on the page said it was SLIGHTLY sweetened, no specific nutritional info was available when looking to order. on the info when the tea arrived was a calorie count of 393cal/serving, and ingredients which include corn syrup solids and partial hydrogenated oils. not what I was expecting from a green tea powder. would NOT recommend."
4,A little goes a long way...,This may be a bit more expensive than regular conditioners but it's very potent and will last a long time. You only need to use a little to achieve the desired detangling and conditioning effect. Hair feels softer and smoother right after and it smells of pina colada.
3,Not so sure,"This webcam works well with the Apple built-in camera that two of my kids use and I have good conversations and reception with them. However, I notice it doesn't work too well with the Logitec which another of my sons uses and there is frequent break-up of voice and picture.I wish the Philips had a wider lens so I could include someone else in my picture (as all my kids can do). I have to move back a good distance from the camera to make that happen. Also wish I could swivel the camera to point out something in the room that I'd like to show."
2,a mild release what happend,"yet another change in lineup, may very well be why this cd was dissapointing. Not very much like there old good stuff. sure change can be good, but this unfortunetly isn't. This cd is no where near as heavy as the previeous. the added melody sounds just plain nothing special here. they were trying for newness, yet it faild,..weak."
3,"Good Musicianship, mediocre lyrics","I might be biased because I've hear very little of God Dethroned, but ""The Toxic Touch"" was dissapointing. The CD has some excellent riffs, the drumming is complex, and the guitar solos are energetic and melodic. However, the lyrics and vocals are VERY mediocre. He seems to be whining half the time about how he hates everything and wants to die, and his vocal range is minimul on this CD. If you're a melodic death fan, listen before you buy it."
1,Whose childhood?,"FYI &quot subsequent research indicated Wilkomirski was really a Swiss citizen named Bruno Doessekker who cannot claim Jewish identity. In 1999, the German publisher Suhrkamp Verlag withdrew the hardcover version of ``Fragments'' from bookstores. Last summer, the Culture Administration in Zurich issued a statement saying that recent research had made clear that ``Fragments'' was a ``freely invented autobiography.''"
1,baffling,"I am amazed that there are so many people posting reviews on here who still think this book is true!People's desire to deceive themselves is strong indeed. I know this book was put out by Random House at first, but who is publishing it now?"
5,"Scary, espercially because it's true. Wonderfully written.","Although this book was very graphic, and a little hard to get into because the lack of chronolical order, it was wonderful. The way that the author retells his memories from a child's point of view is great and you really get a feel for some of the experiences that he had during the Holocaust. It is a must for any Jew or anyone who likes to read true, scary tales from the past, told by the person who experienced them."
1,from believer to angry,I read the book and believed it.NOW IT TURNS OUT TO BE FICTION!!!!MORE AMMUNITION FOR THE HOLOCAUST DENIERS.IF AMAZON IS TO SELL...PLACE IT IN FICTION PLEASE...!!!!
1,Absolute Lies,"This man is a pure imposter. His book only serves as a movie script, for the material is completely fabricated. After seeing the special on CBS's 60 minutes, I am convinced of the skepticism behind this book. This book is one giant lie in itself, and it's a shame that the author can capitalize on its success."
1,Yet another hoax,"Oops! Now exposed as yet another hoax!In the meantime, as the saying goes, the lie has run halfway around the world before the truth had time to put its shoes on."
1,"A total work of fiction, a Hoax","Amazon.com should not be selling this fradualant ""biography"". As a Holocaust scholar I am amazed that you do not list this as a work of fiction. There has been enough revalations on this man's fradulant life. See New Yorker Magazine June 14th , 1999 issue"
1,The Great Deception,"""Fragments"" is a literary hoax. Whether an intentionally deceptive exploitation of the Holocaust, or the delusional creation of Wikomirski's mental illness, it is an insult to both the legitimate chroniclers of this great tragedy, and to the real victims. I am sure that those glowing literary reviews have been rescinded , now that the truth has come out."
4,Validity,"I think we should remain non judgemental when we read narratives such as this one. The degree of psychological instability that exists in authors such as these is usually left out of our criticism, but we need to remember what exactly these people went through. Read this book, its good, and keep your judgement to yourself, because for all we know this book is true and it can only be disproven by the author coming out and saying that it is false."
1,"Liar, liar, pants on fire","The evidence is compelling that Binjamin Wilkomirski is giving false witness to one of the most horrible events in the history of humanity and that makes Wilkomirski despicable. I would have given it zero stars, but it is quite readable and convincing sounding. Therein lies the true troubling aspect of this story. People are going to believe it's true, then find out they've been suckered and begin to wonder if other stories are true. I've studied the European Holocaust for over 40 years (I've been studying the Asian Holocaust for about 10 years). This is revisionist history at it's worst because it is the most terrible form of deception--deception by someone claiming to be a victim."
5,Music lovers take note:,"What a great find! This is an excellent collection of material, and makes a great gift for music lovers. This book contains many hard-to-find tunes. I especially enjoyed the author's introductory comments. Hope we'll see many more books from Kenneth Rainey. I wish there was a CD to go with the book."
3,"Useful for pros, not so much for beginners or amateurs","The book's a little bit slim and contains a lot of rather specialized songs, of great interest to pros and experts (witness the other reviews extolling it) but not to be confused with a large fake book or a compendium of ALL or MANY American and country songs. I'm glad I got it, nevertheless - there are some good songs in it that are hard to find elsewhere. It's reasonably well bound, but I wish all songbooks came spiral bound..."
3,a very basic explanation of operational planning,"The ideas this book covers are still valid in 2001, but it is quite basic compared to today's ""state of art"" knowledge. Still, most of the idea's of measuring, made ""famous"" by The Balanced Scorecard, where already present in this book. It includes criteria for writing objectives and detailed action plans and mentions key reult areas and measurement. This probably explains why many other books refer to this work. If the book was repackaged as a ""10 minute guide to opearional planning, and was priced accordingly, I'd still recommend it. Today, price/quality are out of balance."
3,It will do,"I bought this because I have always wanted one. Unfortunately it did not match the necklace that was shown on the website. The shell's are not as even in size as the ones pictured, and the clasp was different. I did not return it because it will do."
3,Kids like it.,It doesn't taste better than any other popcorn and it takes up a lot of space. But the kids love it.
3,Looks great - popcorn so so,"I bought this gizmo for my son's 5th birthday party. We were having a mini carnival and it was a real hit. The kids loved the machine because it really added to the atmosphere. It's easy to use but I have to say, the popcorn comes out just so-so. I usually pop corn on the stove top and it tastes so much fresher that way. There seems to be a design flaw also. As the kernels begin to pop, they pop out of the kettle with such force that it seems a lot of the unpopped kernels go flying out as well. We ended up with a lot of unpopped kernels as a result."
1,Not worth it,"We bought one and it lasted just over 3 months. The part where you add the popcorn didn't warm up enough to pop the popcorn. We were given one as a gift. It did the same thing. We didn't over use it. Only a couple of times a week. When I emailed the company, they never responded. Don't buy this product. It only has a short warranty."
3,Kinda Neat - PAIN to clean,"Its a kinda neat little toy really. My problem with it is that when it starts popping it blows a lot of the unpopped kernels out. I reduced this issue by using a little less popcorn in it. Another thing I noticed is it seems the steam makes the popcorn a little less crisp then you would get with an air popper.Cleanup is a bit annoying but not much you can do about that. You have to scoop all the old popcorn out of the bottom and because there is no tray to remove to make cleaning easier. Cleanup can be a bit of a task after you finish your snack.That being said, we still like using it and enjoy the popcorn. I recommend using lots of butter and flavoring. If you're looking for low fat popcorn I would go with an air popper because that popcorn will be crisper and tastier without butter."
1,Used Product,I am very disappointed in my purchase . Plexiglas has scratches all over. You can tell someone tried to clean this item up tp pass for brand new. Very disappointed
3,Kettle Popcorn Maker,con...door won't close/latch...have to pop several batches for more than 2 eaters...have to pre-heat kettle 3-5 minutespro...price was right for size of maker
2,Small Kettle Popcorn Maker,"This product is cute, but not practical to make much more than a handfull of popcorn. Cannot load the suggested amount in the popper or the popcorn will clog and not overflow down as required."
4,She loves it!,"I bought this popcorn maker as a gift for my mom, and she loves. It makes really good popcorn. I'm not even much of a popcorn lover, but even I'll admit to that! Nice look to it as well, reminds me of what I saw at movie theaters when I was younger."
1,Worked Once but Not Well then Sent it Back,We bought this for our son's birthday party. We tested it out and it worked ok - didn't really pop like I thought it would but still thought it would be fun and the popcorn tasted good. On the day of the party the kettle never heated up and it never popped another kernel.We were very disappointed but we boxed it up and sent it back. Thank goodness for Amazon's great return policy
5,great popper,Received this popper as ordered. Very neat item. Pops corn very fast in about 3-4 minutes. trying to find an oil that makes it really buttery but the popper is great. Heat lamp works well also.
4,Great,"I have wanted a popcorn machine forever and I finally decided to get this one. It shipped on time and everything was fine with it. It is so cute. I did think that it was going to pop a little more corn (it spits out some kernels before they are able to pop) but overall I really like it. Yes, the motor is a little loud but I have never come across a silent popcorn maker. Overall I think it is a good product."
1,"Deceiving picture, not good quality","This popcorn popper is supposed to cook 8 cups. I used the enclosed measuring scoop and got 4 cups of popped corn and several dozen unpopped seeds on the bottom of the holding area. I'd have to cook 3-4 batches to get enough and it's just not worth the time. The last kernels need to be dumped to prevent burning, so it needs to be watched while it works. It's a cute machine, not loud, but it's cheaply built with mostly plastic. It also has a terrible door latch, too hard to get open and too hard to snap shut. I'm returning this and continuing my search for a fun, cute, retro style popper. For those that couldn't get the crank handle on, it's a reverse screw. The crank handle is just for dumping the rest of the popcorn kernels at the end."
2,Not worth it,"We got this for our carnival-themed wedding. It was great for that, but it's not practical. It takes much too long to get a decent amount of popcorn and it's really hard to clean. Even if you pop the popcorn in the microwave and put in there, it's hard to get the popcorn out. It's good for photographs, but not in real use...We're just going to throw it away. Stick with microwave popcorn or get a modern-day popper."
5,popcorn popper,We love our new popcorn popper. Not only does it work like a dream it is so pretty in the family room.
4,Very nice,"This was a gift for my wife, and she loved it. The kids really enjoy sitting and watching it pop, only problem is the cleanup on the machine after. But overall it's a good buy."
1,One Use,"When my popper arrived yesterday, I unpacked it and popped a batch. It worked well but was a little loud. I decided to have friends over and watch a movie last night. The popper never heated up. I ended up popping the corn on the stove and returning the popper today. Never again with this model."
2,Not so good.,"I purchased this popper almost a year ago. You get mostly seeds back from the pan. They fly out while some kernnals pop. I tried putting less popcorn seeds in, but then it takes a lot longer to get enough to eat. Poor design, lets seeds pop out before they are ready. I used it about 10 times and decided it wasn't worth the trouble. I went back to the kettle on the stove and this popcorn popper is in the basement in storage. It is expensive too."
2,popcorn popper,"Can only make a very small amount of popcorn at a time. If you follow the directions on the popper in regards to amount of kernals of popcorn to make at one time, the popper jams and you have to dig the popped popcorn out. Also, you are then left with many unpopped kernals."
2,So-So,"First off, it looks pretty neat ... but it only gets worse from there. I have noticed a few other people complaining that the crank on the side doesn't screw in correctly and neither does mine. The popcorn that comes out of this machine is only slightly better than microwave popcorn and a lot more trouble to make. I got this as a gift, but had I paid $100 for it would be back in the box and sitting on a warehouse shelf."
1,Door glass broken & taped,"Hello,I opened this item yesterday and the glass door where you open to make and take the popcorn out is broke in 1/2. From top to bottom. It has been taped with masking tape so whoever sold this knew it was broke. I am so very disapointed!I have only bought a few thing from Amazon and just not sure what to do,could someone please help me with what I need to do now?ThanksMel"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!!this was a Christmas gift for my sister and the popcorn burned and none were popped! I am so disapointed that I feel like taking it back to the company myself and having them eat the burnt cernals!!!! 4 days left til Christma, what am I to do now? we live in different states! SOOOOOOO disapointed!!!!!!!"
1,"For the price, don't bother","I bought this January 27th. Tonight, April 25th, the handle fell apart. It is very cheaply made."
2,No Parts Available,I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH NOSTALGIA LOOKING FOR A PART FOR THIER MODEL CCP610 AND WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT THEY DO NOT SELL PARTS FOR THIS UNIT.I RATE THIS UNIT AS POOR
3,popcorn popper,"I was sure that the picture shown in the review was the one that we ordered, however the popper that we received was a Retro Series popper (without Wheels). Number was RKP 630 not the one shown. By the time that I had gotten home, my husband had already used the popper so we just kept it. There were no instructions on how to use the popper or clean it. I figured it out by the pictures on the box. When we tried to reach the seller by phone, we could not. Even though the popper works fine, it was not the one originally purchased and I don't know if there was a price difference. Over all the popper is ok but not the one we ordered and therefore we are not as happy as we could be."
3,I love popcorn,"I love popcorn and don't want to eat the microwave stuff because of the chemicals. This popper is ok. It doesnt pop very much popcorn at once which is a pain and while the popcorn is ok tasting it still isnt as good as movie theatre popcorn. It's easy to assemble and it looks cute although it's a little cumbersome to take in and out of the pantry each time you use it, and if you're going to leave it out you have to wash it after each use because the interior gets greasy from the oil. All in all it's ok, I heard the cheaper one you use on the stove makes better popcorn, I think I'll try that one next."
4,sins of jezebel,glad to be able to see this extremely rare movie. colour good but needed cecil b de milles production values as in samson and delilah.
4,Dave tried to kill me over an ugly sweater. He seems to like this parka better.,"I rescued a Chihuahua. I live in Chicago. Dog clothing has become serious business. I could come home dragging an ice cube on a leash. So I got this parka and Dave likes it. Easy to step in. Easy to step out. Velcro works. He hasn't peed on it by mistake, and that qualifies as a marvel of design. I haven't quite figured out how to make him wear the hood snugly around his head yet. But that's nothing against this hood, I'm kinda wondering how any dog with ears can wear a hood.Wish it came in more colors and large enough for my Bullmastiff."
1,Book is too difficult to read.,"The first chapters jump into flash-forwards of features to be explained later. This may make for a good sci-fi novel, but makes a very confusing technical manual. If you are looking for a book that reads well look elsewhere."
1,What a mistake...,"Before I bought this book I read all the reviews, some were bad, some were good... I decided to listen to the good ones... What a mistake this has been... How can anyone say this is a good book..? It's unreadable! I loaned another book from the library, and now I understand Ada95 much better than before - just by looking at the examples from the other book. Learn from my mistake - DON'T BUY THIS BOOk!"
1,This is the worst programming book I have ever read!,"This is the worst programming book I have ever read - not only for Ada, but for all programming languages. I can't understand how someone gave this book more than 1 star, let alone 5 stars. Stay away from this book, there are plenty of other GOOD books!"
1,It doesn't deserve that many stars.,"Ada, a dead language that will get you a dead end job is shown in all it's splendor here. After reading the second chapter you're supposed to be able to write your own business and scientific applications. Yeah right! This book isn't just the worst programming book I've ever seen, but also the worst book I EVER read.If you REALLY want to learn Ada, use ADA 95: Problem Solving and Program Design by Koffman and Feldman. It teaches you at least."
1,this is a BAD book!,"This is really a terrible book. It is very hard to understand what the author is talking about. There are very few examples, and none of them are complete! I bought this book because it was recommended by my 'programming languages' lecturer - it was a mistake buying it!!! What is most frustrating, is that the Ada doesn't look too difficult - unfortunately, the book makes it difficult."
1,not good no examples,"There were no complete examples, I could not understand anything. Ada must be very hard, it is impossible to learn anything from the book."
5,This is NOT visual Basic,"This is not a begginers guide, or a ""for Dummies"" book either. You are not going to be spoon fed here. To get the most from this book you need to do a bit of poking around on the internet concerning the ""Hello world"" of Ada95, also the structure of Ada programs, interfaces, bodys, then jump in to this work. You will find all you need, but this is not an ARM (annotated reference manual). Be ready to jump around in the text. Use the included Aonix compiler, or the one that comes with Linux. Rememeber this is a small book covering a big subject."
1,Ada 95 2nd Edition (Barnes),"I'll makes this short and sweet. Don't buy this book. It's awful. I wrote Ada back in the late 80's, then transitioned to C and C++ and have been writing C++ and buying related texts since. I recently was assigned a project porting some navigation and guidance control (Ada) software and needed a refresher text. I bought this book. Big mistake. This book is terrible. To any Ada text book writer out there - go get any C or C++ book (say C++ Primer - Lippman)and change all the examples to Ada and likewise the explanations. You'll sell a boatload.) The C and C++ good textbooks are many - not so with Ada. They all pretty much reek. I wound up just printing out the Ada ARM. I use this book as a monitor prop."
4,Freedom from Batteries!,"This weighing scale takes me into the digital age without chaining me in the bondage of batteries. Somehow the notion of using batteries for a product that one steps on occasionally doesn't seem right. For a long time, I resisted getting a digital scale on this account.This is an accurate scale, it doesn't need batteries, and, despite the cautionary statements about not keeping it in a damp area (what were they thinking of: dry bathrooms or bathroom scales that shouldn't be in bathrooms?), it works.The only reason I wouldn't give it a five-star rating is because it needs bright lights to work. If I can read, and I have poor vision, it should be able to work. That would make it perfect.I'm happy, though. The light in my bathroom is enough most of the time."
4,More Betsy adventures!,"When a blizzard hits during the week before Christmas, Betsy and her family are snowbound for days -- along with three travelers whose car broke down nearby. Nine-year-old Betsy and her little sister Star share adventures with their young guests, Susan and Neddie Byrd, including the bungled rescue of a real bird, an unsuccessful shot at making popcorn in the fireplace, and more! Despite the decades that have passed since this book's initial publication, children will enjoy reading about Betsy and her family -- stories guaranteed to remain classics."
4,The Hebrew Torah as it should be in English,"This is an incredible book. I think that anyone who wants to read the TORAH in the Hebraic way but don't know Hebrew this is an incredible translation. This book should be in everyone's library of Christian/Jewish/Messianic Jewish books. I can't say enough about it. The only drawback that I would say about it, especially in dealing with the Hebrew names is it is also helpful to have a general translation with you when you are reading it i.e., Reu'ven=Reuben. This is a minor point but all in all this book is so cool."
4,Not your grandfather's translation--but essential,"This is not the only edition with English translation of the Pentateuch/Chumash that I own, and I don't think it's the only one anyone should own, but it is an essential part of my collection. Fox has combined precision in translation with interpretation and poetry, and the combination makes me run to it very often to see his version, which often makes a challenging and provocative comparison to more traditional translations. The type is large and well-spaced. My only criticism is that the Hebrew is not included; at times I'd like to be able to compare the original words to Fox's renderings, to see how they compare."
5,The Original Hebrew Springs to Life,"I am not a Hebrew Scholar; I do not even qualify as a Hebrew Student. Yet this Biblical translation infuses new life into the first five books of the Old Testament. The meter, the poetry, the nuisances lost in other English translations have been magically restored by Everett Fox.Mix in the insightful commentary that appears opposite the text and you have what is rapidly becoming the translation I reach for when I read or study passages from the Five Books of Moses."
1,Uncomfortable with this version,"I tried working with it a couple of times before returning. Some of the author's comments made me uncomfortable with his theology. The translation didn't line up with ancient Hebrew, so this would not be a work I would feel secure in quoting. Although it will take more effort, I would rather have the ancient Hebrew text and work through the translation. Ancient-Hebrew.org is working on a translation, and I am excitedly awaiting that."
2,Mixed review,"This is a disappointment. I did not realize that it is very thick, due to being filled with commentary, much of which consists of scepticism and trashing the Scriptures. It is not something you can read on the train. Just 5 books of the Bible, but heavier than any Bible I own. I did spent the year reading the Torah portions. The translations is faultless, but the introductions, commentary, etc ruin it in my opinion. I would love a paperback with all the nonsense left out. I feel sorry for the translator as he appears not to have come to faith yet."
4,This book was unique.,I wish I could read Hebrew to prove him wrong but he sounds like he is trying to make the names more Eastern European. The book of Genesis sounds like it was written by a mad man. For the money I paid he should have sent along some audio so I could here how this was supposed to flow.
3,Too much commentary,"I wanted a Torah, translated from the earliest manuscripts and translated by a non-affiliated, objective translator. I think that's what I got, but there is way too much explanation, commentary and presentation of alternatives. All that makes it difficult to read. For instance, you turn the page to follow along and it's not the text, it's some explanation page."
5,Teledyne R-2C4 Water Filter Cartridges (4 Cartridges) (Purchased on 12/04/2009),"Love this product, have used this type of system for 12 yrs. Priced reasonably, works well, very simple to change filters!"
3,A good purchase for the price,"I have the faucet attachment filter, so I found the picture for the product very misleading and confusing. But the filters themselves are pretty good. I live in Los Angeles and the water is so full of chemicals it tastes like pool water. And as a bonus, I live in an older building, so occasionally the water is less than clear. This filter eliminates most of the pool taste and all of the discoloration. I've had water filters that are better, but this one is sufficient for the price"
5,An easy choice.,"Simply said, a perfect match, factory fresh at a good price. Here's to you!With Prime, I had the filters in a couple of days. Easier than going to a shop and trying to find the right filter.Sudden Light: Donegal's Novel"
4,Very Good Music!,"Three of the ten tracks have vocals and the remaining seven are all solos. They feature the setar, santour, kamancheh, tar, and nei. I found the vocals to be annoying at times but please take note that I'm not a fan of vocals in general and am perfectly happy skipping those songs without regretting the purchase of the CD. I liked all the instrumentals very much even though they seemed repetitive at times. The santour solo is especially good and I was disappointed to find that there was only one. That solo was the specific reason I bought the CD. The nei solo is haunting and the three tar solos are all very satisfying. For the most part, this music is subtle and serene but I've found that I can't listen to it without inadvertently thinking about it. I can't use this one as background music. :-)"
1,Warning...Warning Sony DVD Camcorder Owners,"On the back of the box, Memorex claims these work with Sony Dvd Camcorders. Yeah...they work until you get toward the end of your recording and the disc errors out. Will stick with Sony's Mini Dvd-R's since the disc which came with the camera worked flawlessly. Circuit City obviously knows something Memorex does not.....they list these on their site as compatible with NON-Sony Dvd Camcorders. From their site....FeaturesMiniDVD-Rs: Record up to 1.4GB of information or 30 minutes of video on each write-once disc.Quantity: FiveCompatible with: Non-Sony MiniDVD camcordersGreat job Memorex....."
1,CAREFUL IF USING WITH SONY HANDYCAM!!,"I recently purchased a Sony Handycam DCR-DVD 301, and had a tremendous disappointment on it's first use. We welcomed the arrival of our newborn son and used a MEMOREX dvd-r (which is supposed to be compatible) to record many special moments of his first three days at home. Included were his first home bath, first pediatricians appointment, clips from the first long nights, and other video from a proud papa. We planned on sending a copy of the DVD to his 80 yr. old great-grandma on the west coast. Recording went fine, but once finalized, the handycam cannot read the disk, as it shows a disk error. The memorex disk also fails to play in the computer or other devices. Devastated when realizing that the video was lost. Have used Sony dvd-r since and no problems. CHEAP FOR A REASON!"
5,Great set,This is a great apron set. It is made well and not cheap like the others. My 2 year old loves it!!
2,Save your cash!,"What a let down this little shaker is! It looks cool when you first get it - comes in a fancy box! Only after about two uses, water seeped in between the plastic covering and the actual shaker. ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR DISHWASHERS EITHER! To replace it, I bought a dishwasher-safe, Chefmatic shaker at Target for $12 that is a martini makin' champ!Cheers!"
2,A good book sabotaged by its publishing format,"This is a detailed and interesting biography, as readers of other books by Stacy Schiff would expect. But don't buy it in paperback. The publisher skimped and cut corners, and it shows. The font is small and hard to read, with far too many places where broken type makes reading a tiring process. Important people with similar names are not clearly identified in the text, and there's no ""cast of characters"" to help the confused reader. Turn to the index and you'll find it of little use, as there is no distinction between an important relationship and a glancing reference. The footnotes are printed in incredibly small print and are hard to follow. The paperback also appears to lack many of the photos that were included in the hardback version. So if you are interested in Saint-Exupery, bide your time and keep an eye on used book sales for the hardcover version."
2,Short life; long book,"I wanted to like this book, as I have a fascination with this period in history. Unfortunately in order to like the book I needed a much deeper knowledge of all things French than I possess.( I do speak the language.) There was copious name dropping that meant nothing to me. I don't know who Rene Delange, Jacques Chardonne or Emile Raccaud were, so when they, along with hundreds of other people I had never heard of, were frequently introduced into the book with the expectation that I, the reader, knew who they were and why they were important to the story, I simply yawned and lost interest. I think Saint-Ecupery was probably a fascinating man, but if you want to know him, I would suggest that you read one of the books he wrote himslf, and catch a short bio of him from Wikepedia instead of plowing through this exhaustive biography."
3,Still working good,"I bought this a couple of months ago. Not expecting much for this price. But this thing is still working good for me and my wife. We are both under 180lbs (it labels 'not for use over 250lbs') and 5-8""/5-10"" tall. The seat is good for us, after a first-time ache use...There is no light on the display, but the (ordinary) light in our room is sufficient to read the panel.a great starter machine"
2,Piece of crap,It's not libel if it's true. I ordered this bike and the 1st bad sign is the parts bag was not included. Ok company resolved that. About 4 weeks peddling the silent bike began to make the most awful noise which is obviously coming from the rotor. It is not fixable. Do not buy this pos or you will be sorry.
1,15-5300 Silent Magnetic Resistance Upright Bike,"I bought this on amazon and used the free shipping and received it about a week and a half later... Took it out of the box, it's pretty simple to put together (took about an hour). But after about 20 minutes of riding the bike on tension # 6 the rubber belt has flipped off it's wheel (like a bike chain off its gears). The bike is now completely useless as there is no resistance anymore. And I can't get to the belt to try and fix it because the cover is impossible to take off without breaking it. Tried calling customer service but they are only open on weekdays 9-5, going to have to call them from work on Monday.Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a more quality item than this. It'll save yourself a trip to the dump, too. This bike is a piece of junk."
2,exercise bike review,"Description of bike was misleading. Weight limit of person using this exercise bike should have been part of description. Small print in booklet accompanying bike says it is unsafe for more than 250 pounds.Although I weigh slightly less than this, I am afraid to use the bike for fear of it falling apart. I would not have purchased the bike had I seen this limit in the description. Also, the directions for operation of this bike are very complicated. I thought I was purchasing a simple exercise bike, not such a complicated piece of machinery. This bike would be perfect for a younger, more athletic, slimmer person."
2,"Good ideas, bad interpretation of Scripture","I've been searching for a good book on Christian discipline, and I thought this might be it. But after evaluating Clarkson's claims of what the Bible says about discipline, I had to return this book. He has some great ideas, and I certainly lean toward using grace in raising young children. But after a careful review of his word study on Proverbs, I can't come to the same conclusion that he does. I even asked for my pastor's help, and he also does not feel that Clarkson is right in that regard. I think he is correct at the end (...) when he says that it is a choice that parents need to make but it is not mandated by the Bible. And I know that there is probably useful information in this book, but too much of his discussion hinges on his Biblical conclusions that I find false."
4,"Minus chp. 3, it is a great book","This book is divided into 4 Parts, each having 4 chapters. If you are short on time, SKIP Part 1 and go straight to Part 2, beginning with chapter 5. I found Chapter 3 on spanking interesting, but do not agree with all of his conclusions and interpretations. I almost quit reading the book after chapter three, but am glad I stuck with it, because chapters 5 through 16 are great. I also believe this book is meant more for the over 4 ages. If you need a practical book for toddlers and very young pre-schoolers, go for ""Growing Kids God's Way"" series. Clarkson's advice applies more to an age when you can begin to explain and reason with their mind and heart. A two year old needs his actions addressesed differently. Despite chp 3, I highly recommend the rest of the book. My opinion may not be very scholarly, but here it is for whatever it is worth."
5,This book gave me back the joy and peace of parenting,"I read, A LOT of books, especially about parenting. This book is the best one I have read, and every parent needs to read it. First of all, it is wonderful to read a book that helps you believe in yourself, instead of the author's ""method"". Secondly, it shows you how to make room for the Holy Spirit to work in your own individual family, it's not a generic method of legalistic rules. Thirdly, it brings up the discussion of interupting scripture, which more people need to do for themself, instead of following church tradition. I was a spanker, (I just thought it was the ""Christian"" thing to do!) and it was breaking my heart, and my children were becoming distanced from me. Now my heart and home has more peace and joy, thanks to the wisdom from Mr. Clarkson. I am planning on giving this book to everyone I know who has a baby, and am recommending it to everyone."
5,Dave Pelz's Short Game Bible,Superb! The photos are worth a 1000 words. I have found it to be totally sound! His theories all work out. The sand play info alone is worth the price of the book!
5,Great,"I've read a lot of golf articles and books, but this is the first one that immediately yielded results. Great book."
2,Disappointed,"David Pelz focuses more on how he came to his conclusions than correct technique. I truly enjoyed Ben Hogan's Fundamentals of Modern Golf with its detailed descriptions of a correct swing. Mr. Pelz spends pages on why the finesse swing is important, but he leaves many gaps in his instructions. For example, Ben Hogan spent a chapter explaining the proper grip, Mr. Pelz spends more time explaining the relative importance of a proper grip, but only gives ambiguous details about the grip needing to be ""square"" and ""queiter...the better.""I've only finished the first 5 chapters and hope the book improves the instructions. Basically, you can sum up the first 5 chapters with 'the short game is important.' Unfortunately, this is a waste--anyone who buys the book undoubtedly agrees."
3,Great Book - Look beyond the constant sales pitch!,"This Book is great. More great information than you can ever believe. I was annoyed however by Dave's constant selling of his schools and overpriced products. I still recommend the book, however it would have been a five star plus if it wasn't for the hard sell."
5,Pelz Short Game Bible,About half way thru the book. Fairly technical but offers alot of common sense about the short game. Dave Pelz in my opinion adds significant value to the sport. The book is well worth reading.
5,Pelz has presented us with an instructional masterpiece.,"I have long been a fan of Dave Pelz' teachings. Maybe it is the engineer in me. He has applied scientific inquiry and statistics to the scoring games (chipping and putting) for about 40 years. In this very readable textbook, he presents all of his accumulated knowledge and study of the short game. It is both technical and down to earth. Superbly organized, this book can truely offer new insights to a PGA tour pro or teach a novice the basics of one of the most important games in golf. The teaching technique not only tells you what you must do for each type of shot, but explains WHY you must do it that way, and PROVES why this is so. These explanations make a lasting impression which the reader can carry to the practice tee and the golf course.This is a must read for every player interested in lower scores. I can't wait until the rest of this 4 book series are in print."
5,dave pelz short game bible,"this book is excellent. it is very straight forward and detailed not only for the basics of the short game, but also for every trouble shot and bad lie you can imagine. most importantly, his system works! i have shaved a good 6-7 strokes off my game by learning how to score from from inside 100yds."
5,Very helpful for the short game,"I found this book very informative and helpful in making my short game swing more consistent and reliable. Although some might find the teaching of a somewhat mechanical swing not to their liking, it will make it easier for the average golfer to establish a reference for their scoring clubs and be able to reach into the ""toolbox"" and pick up the right club to send the ball the desired distance. My short game was already pretty good, but this book helped me make it more consistent."
4,Pelz short game,I really enjoyed the book and after the heat breaks I think it will help my game. This Texas heat has made my game a survival test and not much of a scoring game. This book gives you lots of data and drills to use the short irons to get the scores down..I have brought my handicap down from a 22 last year to a 14 now. I am confident this book will have it down to single digits by next year!Good read and lots of sensible tips.
2,Help me out here!!!,"How can this book possibly be rated as highly as it is? I just don't get it. The important information could have been presented in about 5 pages instead of the 425 that it took. I found myself TRYING to stay awake and pay attention, but was soon quickly flipping through the book to find anything of real substance. The review below this one has the real point that dave is trying to make... use 4 wedges and learn how far you can hit each one using 3 different backswing lengths. There you have it."
1,Too Scientific to help.,"much too analytical a look at the short game. His NASA background does not help, it confuses. Too much statistical data and too little basic fundmentals. The graphs and photos do not illustrate enough teaching and techniques. Deviation numbers, probability schemes, statistic abnormailities, yada, yada, yada."
2,"nine o'clock?, 12 o'clock? 3 o'clock?....",Golf instructions and gizzmos can generaly be divided into two catagories. First there is all the stuff that doesn't work. Second is all the rest of the stuff that works but that 99 percent of golfers cannot do. Dave has zeroed in on the later. You can practice what he preaches until the cows come home and your game will probably get worse. Why? Because most of us have LOFT. What is LOFT? Lack of Friggin' Talent.
5,Definite help where it matters,"Received the book for Christmas and started reading and practicing that weekend. As a lover of analysis and statistics, I enjoyed the author's analytical style. I was familiar with his excellent writing on the short game and now I see that his insights came from long years of collecting data from pros and amateurs alike.After practicing the author's wedge techniques (changing to a more fixed, repeatable swing) and locking in my yardages for the 3x4 system, I got immediate results. Took only 29 putts the first round after reading, as I was consistently closer to the hole with my wedges. My second round after reading the book was this weekend where I took only 13 putts in 9 holes, while shooting 38 (I am a 12 handicap at the moment.) This is the first golf book I've read that actually changed the way I approach the game."
4,Great background info - difficult to put into practice,"If you wonna know what happens during a short game stroke.Learn about Grain, different grasses, strokes etc. it is the bookto buy. If you have your own privat back yard short game facilititybuy the book you can put everything Pelz teaches into practice andbecome a fantastic short game player. If you are a recreational golferwith less than perfect practice facilities it's a nice book to read butdoesn't help you to much. Pelz teaching is based on the possibility tobe able to messure each short game stroke from 1-100 yards to the flag.On a driving range it's impossible to measure that exactly and on a shortgame green they don't let you pitch from more than 20-30 yards away.As I said a great concept - but difficult to put into practice."
4,Great help for your short game,"Pelz does an in-depth analysis of the flaws of the short game of hundreds of amateur and professional golfers,studies thousands of golf shots, then provides easy to follow solutions for each situation. His methods work ! His background as an engineer gives credence to his conclusions. You may find his analyses a bit weighty, but you can skip right to his solutions if you choose to.An essential book to read if you are struggling with your short game."
4,"Complete, instructive but toooooo wordy","See the other reviews for the content. It's very complete and instructive - it makes a great resource. However, you have to wade through a lot of prose to get to the point. The book could easily be half the size. I wanted to use a highlighter for the important points, but his writing style is so imprecise, it wasn't possible. So in summary, Dave - great book! But hire a writer."
5,Dave Pelz'sShort Game Bible,It has taken me three weeks to pay for this book by taking my opponents money over the weekend. I Knew how important the short game is but failed to embrace the just how important. The book has given me the key to the next level.
2,Long Discussion for a Short subject,"I have great admiration for Dave Pelz and his short game teachings. The book however is a heavy read with a lot of tech stuff about the short game. If I were Dave's editor, I would blue pencil it like crazy with intentions of 1. Making it shorter 2. Making it more understandable to people like me who are not rocket scientists. If he wants to keep the tech stuff, please put it in the back chapters. As a golfer, reader and avid fan of Dave, I just really need simple, transferable ideas which I can use in my game. If they can trim this down to a third of the current number of pages, I would give it 5 stars. For now however, it remains a two star book for me"
4,It's a great book!,"This book has improved my short game significantly. I do not fully comprehend some sections of it, such as bowing your arms. The book is marvelous, but imagine the increased improvements if they were to create a videotape for the book also. Please contact me if you have information on getting the videotape if there actually is one. Sincerely, Fellow Golfer"
5,"AAA Best book in golf, let alone the short game","This is far and away the best instructional book in golf, not to mention the short game on which this book is all about. No more ""half swings"" or ""partial swings"" which in my experience golfers tend to decelerate on because a lack of confindence in swing strength. The 3x4 system is absoluteley the best way to KNOW you have the right club and the swinging the right speed to get it to the pin. Book covers every concievable lie and ball position needed for that lie. Also shows how to ""plan"" your shot with type of grass, direction of grain and landing surface. Because of the length and the need to ""study"" this book I would only recommend it to golfers who are serious about their game. Short game was weakest part of my game but after only a month with this book it has become my strongest, its that fast. Went from an 18 handicap index to a 12."
5,Huge Impact,"This book has had a huge impact on my game, and it's an extremely entertaining read. I was consistently shooting in the mid-90's, and, within three months, I shot an 80. My play is better and consistent. And most importantly, I'm enjoying golf a lot more."
4,Getting Serious About Lowering My Handicap,"When I started to play golf again, after a lay-off of many years, I picked up ""Putt Like the Pros"", so when I ordered this book, I knew Dave Pelz's style.His no nonesense, clear - albeit a bit technical at times, description of how to use the finesse swing to improve your distance wedge, pitch, chip and sand shots, makes sense to my engineering trained mind. Most of the illustrations, except 16 pages in the centre, are in B&W;, and are not of the quality we are used to in the big name golf magazines. On the other hand, the diagrams and sketches are first rate.All in all, I have found the Short Game Bible easy to read and very informative. I look forward to getting out in the backyard or on the practice range, when the weather gets better, to practice the many drills Dave Pelz provides in this excellent book on a much neglected aspect of this great game."
5,Great for improving your score,"One of the best instructional books I've ever bought. Changed how I approach the short game, scores and confidence are much improved. You need to want to improve if you get this book, it is long and there is a lot of practice involved. If you are willing, the book is well thought out to explain concepts."
4,Great for analytical minds,"This book is excellent for the more scientific-minded golfer. Dave Pelz is a true scientist and breaks down golf from an entirely different angle. His practice sessions are a little unreasonable for most people, though. Not too many people would have the time or resources to figure our exactly how far each short game shot travels, but the book is worth the price simply for the reviews of the fundamentals of the short game swing. Just by reading the book and changing the way I practiced, I have taken about 5 strokes off of my handicap!"
5,Great science-based approach,"If you're committed to lowering your average score, Pelz's scientific approach really produces results. Despite its length, it's a fast read and filled with wisdom on the short game shots that you'll encounter most. I did, however, find his coverage of the bump-and-run shot a little weak. Regardless, this book will increase your confidence and that, coupled with Pelz's suggested techniques, will shave strokes off your score."
5,Buy it NOW!,"Excellent performances, no mistakes. One hour an a half of pure Zappa, in its best. Funny too."
4,Frank would have loved it,"The Persuasions,(an a cappella band Frank Zappa gave a record deal to, from hearing them over the phone) play The Meek shal Inherit Nothing.The ever stylish Rockapella (formerly from the PBS gameshow Where in the World is Carmen SanDiego) perform Heavenly Bank Account.Needless to say this is a wicked concert."
3,good,"Plenty of mistakes, especially by Dale Bozzio during wet t-shirt nite. Not a FZ performance but a decent tribute. Definitely worth watching though if just for Mike Keneally's performance, especially during Party Hats."
5,"Gorgeous book, delicious recipes","If you like the magazine Bon Appetit, you'll love this compilation of the recipes that appeared there in 2000. The pictures are beautiful, but the focus is on the food. The recipes include very complex gourmet dishes and relatively simple recipes for daily cooking. Every one I have tried has been easy to follow and has yielded delicious results. There are interesting hints and factoids scattered throughout the book, and it is very well indexed."
5,Collard Power Baby,"Collard Greens and Gravy are a melbourne Blues trio who play swamp delta blues. For a three piece the band can really wail. Ian Collard is easily Melbournes best harp player and does an exceptional job on this cd. This is their 3rd release and still stands strong next to their other wonderful cds. THis album is all originals but has three covers on it, done very well might i add. One might say that it is quite difficult to write orginal blues songs these days, but ian collard does a great job. This cd won an aria and it was very well deserved becuase this is a great album. For those who like delta swampy kind of blues this cd is a must have. Australia has never produced better blues. BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!"
5,Best scale for its price range,"This solar-powered scale is extremely awesome. I do have to do 3-4 readings each time, but usually 3 of those readings are the exact same or only diverge by half a pound, and I just throw out the ""wild card"" reading. It only takes about 30-45 seconds to get those 4 readings, and it is very easy to re-set the scale with the tip of your big toe. Plus, the solar battery charges up in about 3 seconds of light, natural or electric, so it's extremely convenient. It has a sleek look and is light weight; it is also very affordable."
5,Great scale,"I love this scale! It doesn't do anything but tell me how much I weigh, no fancy extras, but the price is right. It weighs me exactly the same as the professional balance scale at my fitness center. I like that there are no batteries, and it only takes seconds for light to register for an accurate reading. A good buy!"
2,17 month scale,"Bought the scale Jan. 22,2010. It died in August of 2011. Not worth the price. If it's any consolation it worked great for 17 months."
1,Defective scale was wildly inaccurate,"I read the user reviews for this digital bathroom scale and ordered with confidence. I did like the size of the platform(my size 10 women's feet fit on it), but I couldn't get an accurate weight. Within a 5-minute period, it told me I weighed 70 lbs, 156 pounds, and 200 lbs! The vendor's customer service told me they'd had good luck with that model, but this one was obviously defective out of the box. I returned it."
5,Fantastic accurate scale,I am so happy with this scale. Finally I have a scale that matches my doctor's office scale.
4,Does what it promises,This is a basic digital scale. It displays accurate (within a pound) and reproducible (within +/- half a pound) weight. It does nothing more. The solar cell works well (a 60W room light will have it working within 30 secs) so no other power source is needed.
4,Works Best in Daylight,"I find the scale to be very accurate. However, I can't get a reading with a 60-watt energy-efficient lightbulb. It does power up with a 100-watt energy-efficient bulb. I find it works best with unfiltered daylight. A mild nuisance, but worth it to protect the environment and save on the cost of batteries besides."
1,"Worked for awhile, now fluctuates wildly","I bought this and it worked just fine for a couple of months. Now it fluctuates 6 to 10 pounds high to 6 to 10 pounds low, all within minutes. I will not buy a product like this from Amazon again, since there is no recourse after 30 days. Major bummer."
5,A classic with broad application,"Even though this book is about the nature of engineering, we read it in our strategy curriculum. It has transfer value for studying the essence of design. The author was 73 when he published this book after a life time of living and teaching the business. He then developed a passion for the history of technology which is what he finished up teaching at Stanford. The book unfolds in a continuous story telling style as Vincenti walks you though five case studies in engineering science from the pioneer era of aviation. The book is replete with substantial ""front porch"" gems of the engineering business. So much so that it warrants more than one reading to take it all in like Kuhn or Hawking. This same statement was made by Dr. Michael Jackson author of ""Structured Design"" and ""Problem Framing"". See [...]"
3,try to stay awake when you read this one....,"this was a required book for my master's program and let me say this is a HARD book to read. The language is difficult to understand and it is just plain drab to read. It lacks creative examples and activites. The information is good, just not presented in an interesting manner."
1,Not what was expected,Bilingual and ESL Classrooms: Teaching in Multicultural ContextsI ordered a Used book and didn't get what was expected. The condition the seller said the book was in and the condition it ACTUALLY was is were not the same. Condition much worse then expected. Very disappointed!
2,Strange Novel,"The book is long and difficult to get through. The plot is strange and twisting, though the characters are interesting and complex. The book wanders in and out of storylines, making the plot difficult to follow. The story is full of sadness and sorrow."
5,hidden masterwork,"Every now and then I stumble across a book that absolutely captivates me and yet has been either misunderstood or completely ignored by the critics. This is one of those books.There are enough plot synopses elsewhere here to give you some sense of what goes on in the book, but none of them can convey the almost hypnotic attraction of the prose (I can't speak for the original, but the translator seems to have done a masterful job). All I'll add is that the mysterious, inviting cover is the perfect entree to this magical novel. Beyond that, just this: Read it."
2,Reviews and research looked promising.,"Arrival was fast. Case looks protective. What I didn't like was the size. It's huge. I didn't like the tripod as I bird and needed one to view from standing position not lying on the ground. Just dn't fit my needs. As far as quality of scope, didn't spend time with it, the size overwhelmed me. As far as returning no hassle except fit the 60 day credit - seemed excessively long."
2,Spotting scope not as advertised,"The scope is fine but it came in a soft case, not a hard one as advertised. I am sending it back. This kind of order [un]fulfillment is not acceptable. Nor is the unnecessarily complicated return label process. We will find it hard to order from Amazon in future. If the product came from LG Outdoors, then Amazon has poor oversight. If the product came from Amazon, then Amazon needs to have a more accurate product description.This is not a review of the scope, which is good for the price, but of Amazon's customer service."
5,Alpen 20-60x80 spotting scope,"This is my first spotting scope. I just got into benchrest rifle target shooting and thought this scope might fill the bill.It is larger than I expected, but it works just fine. The quality of construction is very good. Very beefy, and I like that. I've never looked through the uber expensive scopes so I can't compare the glass clarity, but I found the magnified images bright and sharp through this glass.I like how the rear half swivels and the built in sunshades work very well. The fine focus is easy and smooth.While other reviewers thought the tripod to be flimsy, I found that it works perfect for me, and is sturdy enough for my application. It traks left and right and up and down fine.The transport case is solid and keeps the scope safe.The whole package works great for my needs and I find it to be a great deal for the money."
5,Computer Integrated Manufacturing,I read this book cover to cover and learned many new things. This book is a welcome addition into my library.
3,"Good book but,","The book came without software. Also, this book was purchased for a Industrial Tech class, but did not meet the requirements. No fault to the book, I'm just sayin ;) Wish I was aware of that, before I worked 6 chapters ahead. lol. I had to purchase another book, Automation, Production Systems, & Computer-Intergrated Manufacturing, by Mikell P. Groover. Another $194 out of a college student budget, priceless.This would be a good example on how to spend more trying to save a buck. (DEI)(PTK)(GK)Good day ;)"
1,These phones are useless. Don't Buy,"I have had nothing but trouble with these phones. They are too small, the sound quality is poor (when they work), and they rarely work. I bought one set from Staples which quit working after about 2 days so the company sent me a replacement set which never worked. I am done with these phones, I am sending the replacements back and taking the originals back to Staples for my money back. I also aquired another cordless phone from American Telecom which has extreamly poor audio quality. It seems to me that American Telecom sells cheap junky phones and tries to make money on the prepaid long distance feature that comes on the phones. Don't bother unless you are in desperate need of a headache."
1,"Stopped working, company won't honor warranty","My American Telecom Pay 'N' Talk 4-pack telephones stopped being able to dial out after about 11 months. Although they were still under warranty, the company refused to replace or repair them. They sent one email reply telling me to try replacing the battery. That didn't work, and they haven't replied to my emails since then. They also are not reachable by telephone OR EVEN BY MAIL. Do yourself a favor and don't buy American Telecom phones."
3,Surviving the Johnstown flood,"This book tells the story of a fictional survivor of the infamous Johnstown, Pennsylvania, flood of 1889. From the destruction of her home in the initial wave, struggling to stay afloat on a soggy mattress, Megan Maxwell finds her entire world swept away. She joins an unlikely group of survivors, who struggle to find friends and relatives in the wake of the disaster, and in the process discover strengths in themselves. This book provides a details look at the magnitude of the disaster that struck Johnstown on that Friday evening more than a century ago, and helps to put a human face on the suffering it caused."
4,Great book for young girls,"It's has been very difficult trying to find books for my twin 8yr old daughters.I wanted a series of books with the star character being an African American girl just having fun and doing kid stuff. A book that will make them know that reading is fun. This book does just that and more.If you're looking for a great chapter book for an African American girl, then author Ann Cameron's ""Gloria Rising"" and ""Gloria's Way"" is it.Also, try Valerie Wilson Wesley's series of ""Willimena Rules""."
5,brilliant (if you have the right mind for it) :),"Take this psychedelic-ethnic-dub compilation to the highest mountain tops and let the music take over your mind.The journey begins with a 20 minute composition masterpiece that only gets better with age.Thank you Simon, Raja, and Sheldon for this cosmic beauty."
5,Surfer's Yoga,"After surfing for 40 years, I've found that my balance and reflexes have been getting worse. My sessions were getting shorter because of severe shoulder pain that only happens from a lot of paddling. I had never done Yoga before and decided to give this DVD a try since it was specific to surfing and other board sports. I am so happy I did! In just a few weeks, my balance has improved and my shoulder doesn't hurt from paddling any more. Adding this DVD to my excerise routine a couple times a week has made surfing fun again for me instead of painful."
2,"Not a yoga video, just a simple stretcher","This video is very simple as a pre and post workout with a 20 minute segment for both and some filler in between. I have been surfing for a while now and doing yoga, even not have been on a regular weekly yoga schedule (like 4 months) I really didnt get much of anything out of this video, Just a lot of simple stretching excersises that a good surfer would do any ways for the arms but not worth the cashe. If your looking for a workout type of yoga video, go with something eles. If your looking for a surf related excersise video look at ""Surf Excersises"" that is designed by a surf trainer and shows how it is useful in all aspects of surfing. Nicely done just not hard enough for me or intense, mellow vibes and too easy."

2,Waiting for the full 4-hour version to be released,"I was so excited when I saw that Children of the Dust was now available. I should have realized by the changed name that this would be an edited version. I can only hope that with all the complaints that the full version of this great mini series will be released by the studios in the near future. Until then, I am glad I taped it when it was on TV so I can enjoy it in its entirety."
3,More entertaining than the book,"Beautiful, romantic, sad movie that I personally found more entertaining than the book. Probably because both works focus on and develop different characters.A part of U.S. history that none of us should ignore or forget about..."
1,this book reeks,"I ended up deleting this book from my kindle before I finished it I just couldn't stand the endless loops of circumstance, and very sporatic action.This book is an absolute waste of money. Do yourself a kindness and pass on this golden oppertunity"
3,Good Day To Die,"I purchased the video based on the t.v. mini-series which originally was televised as ""Children of the Dust"". They aired the movie again under its new title, ""Good Day To Die"". An excellent movie. I was really disappointed to find that the movie had been edited, and I felt key scenes were cut. I don't understand why they (whoever ""they"" are) had to do that."
1,Be careful of this one! Drive capacity?,"Be careful of this one! The title and product description DO NOT specify size of drive in GB. The picture shows a 320 GB drive, but the model number seems to be for an 80 GB drive."
3,They work,"These are not high quality. They will work, but would want better quality if purchasing again. Sharper and better fit."
3,Entertaining enough,"The two reviews dated 2000 are obviously about a different product since this dvd has just come out. This is an anime OVA based on a RPG. The characters fill stock roles (cleric, warrior, witch, etc.) and the storyline is a typical quest to conquer a world-threatening evil being (Dhaos the demon king). However, the animation is beautiful,the heroes are appealing despite the lack of character development, and the story was interesting enough to hold my attention. The beginning and ending musical themes are very nice. The storyline is complete on this disc -- I don't know if there will be a sequel (re the vol. 1 in the title) but this works well as a stand-alone."
4,Dog coat,I got this for my mom's dog who lives in Michigan. I think it is a little too bulky for her and she doesn't like to wear it but it is a great buy and made well. She's a 19-lb. terrier mix.
1,Don't waste your money,"It is an extraordinary compilation about what the author says the other authors did not say. I just read NATIONAL IDENTITY from Anthony D. Smith, and it cannot be compared. Smith also talks about ethnonationalism, but in a better way. Connor does not say something new, nor interesting. And also, it is a compilation of papers previously published. Roberto Remes"
4,Great Teacher's Edition.,"Recommended to those using this textbook to teach a class or tutor a student. Contains all answers to end-of-chapter questions, plus extra information on topics for you to supplement your teaching."
4,home copy...,Great to have affordable options to purchase copy of textbook for home use...they are so heavy to carry back and forth from school. Book contition was as advertised.
2,"the story is good, but mckenzie, loyal? not hardly....","i think it's funny how often the word 'loyalty' comes up to describe mckenzie's character in these reviews and descriptions of the books. there is nothing loyal about a man in a relationship with a woman who he claims to love and have considered marrying, yet falls in love with a different woman each time he starts investigating another case. when i first started reading this series i loved mckenzie. the more books in the series i read though, the more i am starting to dislike him."
3,for the team,"The author is talented and never boring. The plot, this time, is just average. The bad guy is spotted early, the only mystery is in the details. We are introduced to another investigator who looks to be back again. A good series despite this slip."
4,suspense and personality,"This is such an elegant suspense thriller full of superbly crafted characters - none of them lack real presence, each one of them - even the minor characters - have a distinct and appealing personality. There are, of course, extravagant events and circumstances. And there is also strangeness in having the King and the Prime Minister as prominent characters too. But how did Hoffmann come up with the idea of an elderly female sleuth so early in the history of mystery stories? And then there is that perceptive observation of human nature in all its bizarreness. The more I read of Hoffmann the more I am in admiration:recommended other reading:ETA Hoffmann: Tomcat Murr - this is also a mystery but of an altogether more substantial character - far more fancifulEA Poe: Mystery Stories - more early investigative and psychological thrillers"
2,Not as good as described!!!,"I really thought I was going to see something totally different than a typical UFC card. The video describes this ""blood & guts"" and ""turn your head"" type fights but does not deliver. The only notable exceptions are the combatants do not use gloves and headbutts are allowed. Other than that, I've seen the exact same thing on Spike, not to mention many better fights. I did like seeing ""Renato"" when he was younger in the one fight he was in. Also having the Doctor wipe the blood off the fighters WHILE still fighting took me back a little. Overall, video is not worth spending your money on."
2,"The 1999 Franchise Annual: ""the original"" Franchise Handbook","I was disappointed. Although I am sure it is a difficult task to maintain an accurate, complete, and up to date database on thousands of corporations, I expected more. On a more positive note, the book does a good job of listing corporate email addresses, phone numbers and contact info."
5,Great!,"I just recieved it, and it looks even better than it does on the picture! Yeah, brilliants are kind of cloudy, but it doesn't make it worse. It perfectly fits my wrist, and looks beautiful. I would recommend this item for every one!"
2,not what expected,"I received this bracelet yesterday and it is nothing like the picture. The diamonds and VERY cloudy...not sparkly. I am sending it back for a different one. If you don't mind the cloudy diamonds, this is your bracelet."
5,To be oblique is simple. To speak simply is hard.,"I know nothing of Sally Belfrage, save for the wonderful and witty glimpses at her life contained in UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES, and that her death four years ago is a loss at once untimely and tragic. It is easy and perhaps good to be cynical about the American memoir--this being the realm of writing, after all, that often falls prey to numbing self-aggrandizement or an equally offensive ""woe is me-ism."" But where others sing the praises of an unattainable past or apologize for national pathologies, Belfrage embraces ambiguity with a voice that is both witty and serious. For those of us born after the 1950s--i.e. those whose conceptions of the period are informed by Henry Winkler and Bill Haley on one pole and the baleful stare of Roy Cohn on the other--this book is an entertaining and effective antidote to our shared cultural myopia. Suddenly, my parents make so much more sense to me..."
1,A different voice for sure,I few good songs. I think maybe Pete Seeger and Ewan McCol's association with her have made her more famous than her talent. Sorry if that's a little rough
5,"Fast Shipping, Great Quality, Great Dealer!! *****","I received this item exactly two days after the payment was confirmed. Very fast shipping! The shirt came brand new, nicely packaged, In the plastic wrap unopened. The shirt quality is very great the lettering still looks untouched even after two washes! Thanks allot! -Rich Rage"
1,Absolute hype,"This is just another example of the junk out there that is so Hyped Up in advertising lingo that it should be against the law to even print it. I have been a Karaoke KJ for over four years and thought from the advertising hoopla given this piece of equipment, it just might make a bit of a difference to some of my "" on the edge"" singers. Well to tell you the truth it makes them sound worse, kind of like they are singing in a barrell. Don't waste your money on VocoPro's ""Vocal Enhancer"", it is just not worth the money."
5,VocoPro DA-X10Pro,"I'm very pleased with the product I bought.It looks and works great,just what we needed at church! Thank You will buy from you again."
2,Vocopro DAX10PRO,"It is not much good because the master volumn for music and microphone controller on the top right corner are not working. Controller turn them down or up, but the output volumn are the same."
5,Won't Die,"I bought this set of pens from a Staples (I think). I quickly realized that I wasn't going to ever lose track of them. They are awesome. The tip is super durable, fine writing. I use them for writing on plans, labels, and anything else I need to write fine and permanent. I use these nearly daily, and I haven't ran out of ink, and they won't dry out. If they do they seem to self prime, and you can get them going again. They say they are even refillable on the case. But for $11, you can't beat them.They are by far my favorite felt tips."
5,Best Permanent Marker Ever,"These are the best permanent markers I've ever used. I have used them to mark on glass, plastic, all kinds of tape, labels, etc. I was never able to wash off the ink with soap and water, but rubbing alcohol will remove the ink. Since they are a little hard to find, I save them for applications where the markings will be subjected to a lot of washing or rubbing, or in cases where the marks absolutely must stay put.The markers also last a really long time if taken care of properly. I bought a set of these pens over 10 years ago, and one of these markers still works! The other three eventually ran out of ink. Overall, I highly recommend them."
3,Pretty Good,"The results from my using this waterpik has been fantastic. I had sore gums and within one week it was gone. I'd encourage everybody to use this product. The only problems I have w/the travel size is: the resevoir is too small. It should have been taller. You need to refill it once or twice. Also the hose is too short. I got mine 2 years ago and it still works fine. Except the tiny little plastic piece that keeps the hose attached to the device has split in half. That's the only replacement piece I need and I can't find that anywhere. At this point I'm going to MacGuyver it w/duct tape, so I won't have to buy another one."
2,Battery is a problem,The battery is two 1.2v. Ni-cad's. Why didn't they just use two AA ni-cads? Should be able to find a replacement after some research.
3,Not much of a discount,"I've seen this item in stores selling for $64.99 (w/tax about $69), so this price of 59.99 + at least 3.99 shipping = about $64, is only about a $5 savings off store price"
4,Missing what I wanted,"Haven't read the Amazon info on this since I bought it a year or more ago but in case it indicates it contains ""By His Bootstraps"" (by Anson MacDonald, pseudonym of RAH), don't you believe it. It's got many classic Heinlein stories and of course they're all good but that was one I really wanted to read again and thought I'd be able to."
4,Just not Burroughs enough,"There's just too much of Lansdale and not enough Burroughs. In Poodle Springs by Raymond Chandler and Robert B. Parker, you can not tell where Chandler ends and Parker picks up. In finishing a lost manuscript, the author finishing should attempt to stay as true to the original authors style as possible. Lansdale failed in this area. The book is good reading and a good adventure, but just like the movies, just not Burroughs Tarzan."
2,"Fast adventure, but not ERB!","I was looking forward to this latest offering from the ""Burroughs vault"" It was a fast paced adventure that was hard to put down. But I think it was more from wanting to get to the real ERB stuff, than wanting to see what happened next. It just never happened. The blood and gore was sadly overdown, even for Tarzan. Interesting cliff hanger. First time that has happened."
4,hated the ending,"could not understand what happend between Tarzan and Jane at the end, otherwise the book was good.Enjoy the series"
5,excellent,"this is an excellent book for children from ages 7 - 13. it is very imaginative. it is about four siblings, three sisters and one brother, who find a magic talismen that looks like a nickel. this magic nickel will grant them half a wish. before they figure this out, they get in a load of trouble. instead of going to a desert island, they land in the middle of a desert. instead of having Mark's (the brother) friends not at camp but playing baseball with him, his friends end up being half way there (they disapear from camp but are translucent when playing baseball). Once they figure out what it does, they use it to get them into and out of trouble. they even bump into the great Merlin of the medevil age! have a great time reading it... i know i did!"
4,Half Magic,"I first read Half Magic at the age of 11. I was swept away by the magic, the humor, and the thought that just perhaps one day I would find a magic coin, too. Over the years I have recommend this book to many young people. It is a wonderful book for parents to read with their children. The four bored children in the book soon find a summer full of adventure and magic. Full of surprises, some history and definitely adventure. Every once in awhile I find myself rereading Half Magic just to bring back a little bit of my youth. A copy of Half Magic is a must for your children's library."
4,The thinking kid's magic story,"I appreciate the warm fuzzy reviews that wax nostalgic about the reviewers' own childhood reading. But you have to be careful, because a lot of books are remembered better than they are read.Well, the good news is that this book has held up to the test of time pretty well. That is especially so because a number of current books with fantasy/magical elements are just too easy. I don't mean too easy to read, I mean the use of magic is too easy. There are helpful faeries, or mystical swords, or magic gems, or obvious clues, or know-it-all wizards, every few pages. But here, the kids have to figure out how the magic coin works, figure out how to do half-magic wishes, and figure out how to handle the consequences. The book is entertaining, with great characters, but is also like a big puzzle that has to be solved bit by bit. A nice change of pace and pretty demanding given the age group it's aimed at. Certainly worth consideration as you build your kid library."
4,From a seven year-old who loves magic and words,"""I like it that the magic is always thwarting them and when Jane wishes for a fire they get a small fire. I like it from beginning to end. Jane and Katherine are my favorite characters because Katherine likes poetry and she's also very funny when she's at King Arthur's Court and wishes to be a knight. Jane is always impatient in a funny sort of way."" (By way of mom)"
3,Okay,"This book was okay, but is meant for younger children. I was disapointed how easy it was, it could have had more challenging word. I highly recommend this book to children from the range of 8-10, maybe even younger. Older children may enjoy this book to, but if an older child reads it, I highly suggest to read it for fun and not for school."
5,Half Magic Review,Half Magic is a story about four children. 3 girls Martha Jane and Kathrene and 1 boy Mark. Jane find a magic charme. They soon find out that it grants wishes: by halves. with their charm they have many adventures and lots of problems. At the end they find a step father. This is a great story. I advise you to read it.
5,Old Favorite Worth Rereading,"I loved this when I was a kid, and I love giving it to my nieces and nephews. Edgar Eager did something unique in the Fifties: he featured strong girls who participated with their brothers and male cousins in all their adventures. I prefer the original illustrations by Jack Gantos (whose drawings are reminiscent of Hilary Knights') to those by N.M. Bodecker in the new edition, but I expect it depends on what you grew up with."
5,Delightful book,"What an enjoyable book. My four children and I absolutely loved reading this book. I wish I could find more like it. Well written, full of adventure, excitement and good old fashion standands. This is a book every child (and adult) should get to read."
3,This is an okay book.,"The book ""Half Magic"" is kind of boring at the beginning, but from the middle to the end its interesting. The book is about four children who find a magic coin that looks like a nickel. The kids wish for all different kinds of things with the magic coin. I rate this book for three stars because it was quite interesting toward the end. I recommend this to kids who like magic. I think you should read it yourself to really find out what it's like."
4,It is a good book,Half Magic was a good book.I would recommend it to children who like fairy tales.But if you usually read mysteries and other types it's just a waste of time.
5,fan-tabulous!,"i love this book! i have read and re-read it periodically for the past 3 years. for weeks after i first read it, i was looking everywhere i could for shiny objects on the sidewalk. this book was extremely enjoyable and believeble. i would reccomend it to everyone."
4,Not as good as Magic by the Lake,"This book, the first of the Eager series on four children and their descendents, is not as much fun as Magic by the Lake, but will still instill a sense of magic and adventure in your child. We started a bit too young, I think, at seven. I imagine 9-11 year olds would have a bit more fun with this book."
4,Half Magic by Heidi Neubelt,"Half Magic is about when Jane finds a coin on a sidewalk. The coin grants wishes but only half of them. For example, if you wish to be on a desert island, you will end up on a desert instead. I liked this book because it leaves you hanging of your seat. ENJOY!"
2,Half magic,"I purchased this book as a read aloud for my two oldest children. I liked the story but the chapters were way too long. My children kept asking, ""how many more pages?"""
2,"Nice idea, but shallow writing","I was very disappointed with this book, particularly since all the reviews were so good. The idea was great, but the writing was very shallow. Everything happened too fast, the children solved every problem within a matter of seconds (and always by using magic) so you can hardly believe they really learned anything. The action wasn't believable and none of the characters were developed. I wouldn't read it twice."
1,Not a good read aloud,Did not like at all. It made an awful read aloud. We actually started skipping pages just to get through the book.
5,When I Was Six,"When I was six years old (almost 50 years ago) and in the first grade, my teacher brought a selection of books into our classroom from the library. As first graders, we weren't allowed to go to the library, so this was a real treat. One of the books had a half black and half yellow cover with, if I remember correctly, mirror images of a coin, half on one side and half on the other. I eventually checked this book out and, in first grade, read it.I was hooked on reading from then on. And I read Half Magic so many times I may have worn my school's copy out.Until I began trying to find this book, with its black and yellow cover, for my grandchildren, I was unaware that the author had written other books. What a treat I must have missed.Now if I could just find a copy of that black and yellow book that instilled in me the joy of reading ..."
4,A funny book,"Half Magic was a good book becuse it's funny, and my favorite part is when the baby eats the magic charm.you'll have to find out what happens next when you read the book."
5,A Great Fantasy that teaches a lesson,"After hearing about this book from a friend, I decided that I would get it when I saw it at a school book fair. This is one of the best books around! I read it very quickly, and enjoyed the story of Jane, Mark, Katharine, and Martha very much. The author did a teriffic job of making you feel a part of the book. Half Magic also teaches a lesson though- be careful what you wish for, it just might come true!"
5,"Half Magic, Completely Terrific",This super book has my boys (age 9 and 7) rolling around in stitches. It is beautifully written and the children in the story find themselves in some hilariously funny as well as touchingly sweet situations. A book that the whole family can look forward to reading. Can't wait to read the sequels.
3,1963 is calling.,"If I had known this book was published in 1963, I probably would not have bought it. The fact that other reviewers called it a ""classic"" should have tipped me off.I did enjoyed reading it, so much so that I read the entire book the same day I got it. I especially like his advice on how to choose an ad agency.I imagine much of the advice is as true today as it was in 1960, but a lot of the advice is as dated as Ed Sullivan. It is left to the reader to decide what to ignore and what to cherish."
4,Still feels fresh,"I read a well thumbed second hand copy of this book twenty years ago. At the time, even though it had been around for ages, much of the wisdom contained within its pages was up to date and relevant to advertising in the early nineties.For reasons I can't remember, I took a copy of this book on holiday this year, and read it in a day. I couldn't believe how something written so long ago still held true in the age of internet and iPhones. A must buy, me thinks."
4,Original Ad Man,Great insight into many areas of advertising and the life of one of the greatest ad men of all time.
3,Not a mystery at all,"Although it seemed promising, the book tries to be both a thriller and a mystery. Sadly failing in both. The plot's convulated and there are far too many walk in characters. Poorly organised and messy."
5,Historical expression of the feminie body.,"""Agent Provacateur"" by authors Joseph Corre and Serena Rees celebrates the senuality and spirit of a woman. The pictures emphasize the curves and softness of the feminine form supporting centuries of how changes in society and politics have affected women and how they should look and act in a certain way in public and in private. The millenium woman no longer has to feel ashamed of who she is physically. ""If you got it, flaunt it. If you don't have it, get it!""The authors have done an excellent job in supporting their historical facts with pictures dating back to early times and pieces of erotic literature. Inside of the book is a letter detailing the lingerie the visitor has bought on her holiday. This book is by far, the most emphasized of sensuality and fashion.Agent Provacateur is located in London's Soho distict. Opened in 1994, the shop is widely popular among celebrities, housewives, and businessmen."
3,Coulda Been Better,"I'll start out by saying the only reason I got this movie is because I ADORE Clancy Brown!I felt the pace of this movie was way too slow and the idea of the lead character being an alcoholic and part of the plot dealing with his slip into madness/alcoholism is trite and has been done way too many times.The most interesting development was what was on the $20 but the story sometimes side tracked from that and *SPOILER*Clancy Brown's character doesn't appear until the last 10-15 mins of the movie! Grrrr, irritating to say the least."
4,Something for everyone,"THE TWENTY would make a fine addition to anyone's movie library, particularly fans of TITANIC II."
3,Trucos indios,"Este libro no tiene mayores pretensiones.No es gran literatura. Me refiero a un libro liviano, sin destellos, sin espesor.A ratos, poco creíble, se nota que el autor tiene un manejo débil de las técnicas narrativas.Sin embargo, tiene el mérito de poner a la India, con sus inmensas riquezas y miserias, en la palestra.En suma, un libro para adolescentes."
2,Now that's not magic,"The jacket blurb describes Tahir Shah as an ""uproariously funny writer"". Well, I cracked a smile once or twice, but funny this is not. The dialogue is weak, the clumsy attempts at wit are forced and toe-curling, and Shah comes across as a tetchy,irritable and intolerant foreigner.The book tries to pass itself off as a travelogue but the hokey, conveniently slapstick encounters appear contrived. There is a suspicious lack of photographs of any of the main characters or more sensational events in the book and I ended up believing very little of the narrative. Which is a shame, because buried very deep under the poor writing (see how many verbs Shah can use to avoid the perfectly adequate ""said"")is an interesting look at the resourcefulness of India's poor. A decent rainy day read but a missed opportunity by the writer."
2,Should be labeled as fiction,"On pages 15 and 16 there is the story of a woman from Chicago who went to a cosmetic surgeon in Karachi and asked for liposuction. When she came out of the anesthetic she found that her lips had been removed. Gimme a break! This is prime urban myth material. After this section how can I believe anything in this book? Although, taken as fiction, it was somewhat amusing."
2,"Should be titled ""How'd they do that?""","I happened to glance at the title for Mr. Shah's book as I passed the travel section at the local bookstore, out of curiosity I picked it up. I thought it was in the wrong section. After reading the dust jacket I thought it might be like ""The Magicians Wife by Brian Moore or The Illusionist by Dinitia Smith."" I did like the personal story and the insites into the society and culture of India. But all I really got was as one reviewer said was a ""guy that runs up and jumps on the stage in front of everyone screaming and shouting I know how its done!"""
5,Great B movie,This review is for the full uncut version which lasts about 90 minutes. I've recently purchased this movie again and I received the 82 minute version which removes a lot from the sex scenes. The long version is great and I would like to get my hands on it.
2,Wow...,"And I don't mean that in a good way. The acting in this movie is awful. Even the sex. About the only thing actress Wendy Schumacher has going for her is her gravity-defying chest. And the whole plot with the blind music producer and the exhibitionist? Give me a break. This movie is bad, even for a skin flick. 2 stars."
1,Misleading and waste of money!,"Even though the pictures show livestock, there is nothing that says it's for animals, and the instructions say to ""place the probe well under the tongue, keep the mouth closed..."", so it's clearly not made for animals. It's the same kind as I have in my medicine chest for when I get sick. You can buy the same thing at the local drug store! If this was for animals, it should have instructions for proper use on animals. Completely misleading and very disapointing!"
2,Butterfly,"This is a very styling money clip, however, it is not like a big paper clip. It opens like a butterfly, then closes together with the strenght of the magnets. It feels that your money and other cards might fall off. I'm not sure if the magnet could wipe of your credit card information."
1,Not What You Think,"I thought it would be good idea to warn fans of Fiona Apple, but especially fans of 80's metal/pop singer Fiona, that this is not a recording by Fiona or Fiona Apple. It is in fact an all together different artist that goes by the name of Fiona. This album ""Forever"" is a soul recording. I am a fairly big fan of 80's metal/pop Fiona and picked this one up thinking it may be her brand new recording, which by the way STILL isn't out!!! Anyways, I made the mistake in picking this one up, please don't do the same."
4,Our 6 year old girl loves this,"This book is a good read, not sure all kids will like it but our girl is very interested in animals and reptiles, she has adsorbed a lot from this book."
5,Well written and very user friendly.,This is a great guide for children. It is very user friendly and I will be using it with my students a great deal.
4,Reptiles and Amphibians,Excellent book. Great color photos and descriptions for identifying the frogs in which I was particularly interested and see in my area. The size of the book makes it easy to carry in my photo bag or back pocket.
5,The best of gumby,"This movie has seven favorite episodes: ""Robot Rumpus"", ""In TheDough"", ""The Groobee"", ""The Small Planets"", ""Ricohet Pete"", ""Witty Witch"", and ""Hidden Valley. The movie is may be about 45 minutes long. Lable: Family Home Entertainment."
4,Beautiful!,"I received this ring for a Christmas present from my sister, and it looks great. I think it looks better in person than in the photo. I have very small hands, so I wear it on my middle finger. I think that proportionally, that is probably the best finger to put it on. I think it's a little overwhelming as a ring-finger ring. I really love the marcasite, and the ring is very shiny. I was surprised to see the price when I looked it up on Amazon to write the review. I thought it would have been more expensive. I also like that it is real sterling silver, so it doesn't upset my sensitive skin.The one thing I don't like is the design sometimes catches on things like when I stick my hand in my pocket. I am a little worried that I might catch it and bend it since silver is a malleable metal. I just try to be a little more careful when I am wearing it out and about."
3,not a good choice for small hands,"This ring looks delicate in the photo but much less so when you receive it. It's best for someone with fairly large hands. I'm 5'4"" and wear a size 6 ring and it looks very clunky on me. Also, it's definitely not one of those rare finds where you can't believe how little you paid for it. It looks like a $20 ring, which is fine since it's nice to have rings like that for casual wear. And on someone with large hands it would be quite nice."
1,Battery will go bad..,"I used it for a year and stopped used it since then (two, year years passed now) because battery life is just too short.I did not use this mouse extensively, so it is not fair, not good for the money. Also, clicking is very touch. You gotta give some power to push the mouse buttons."
5,Best Travel Mouse,"Very cool! Works great and travels in Laptop - hard to misplace, automatically recharges it self."
4,A Fabulous Bluetooth Mouse!!,"If you are looking for a slim Bluetooth mouse with a maximum portability and affordable price, this wonderful Pc Card Mouse will be your best choice. Battery life is never an issue as it charges itself when it's plugged into your laptop's PCMCI slot. The only disadvantage is missing of the scrolling button.This product has the same design and functionality of MoGo Mouse, but in a better price. Check this outMoGo Mouse, Wireless 2-button Bluetooth Mouse (Gray)"
3,Ecelent but make sure you have the right one,"The unit sync fast, last long, feels great (compared to the pad). However, no third button or scrolling function is really bad. Furthermore, it does not fit in new notebooks because they are mostly express cards that are narrow. Some might look like they are regular PCMCIA slots but tapers down so check your units carefully. If you have an older NB that takes PCMCIA the chances are it does not have a built in Bluetooth. Make sure you have 2 spare PCMCIA slots-one for the mouse and one for a PCMCIA Bluetooth adapter. Otherwise, if you get a Bluetooth USB adapter you might as well get a regular wireless mouse. So either wait for the June-07 release of the new mouse or otherwise if Bluetooth is not built in I recommend Zoom PCMCIA Bluetooth adapter 2.0 + EDR."
2,Shipping Cost is Astronomical!!,"I bought one of these without looking at the shipping cost - $7.65, for an item that weighs about an ounce!! Your total price will be $17.64. It's a nice cover, but.... Maybe you folks should lower that shipping charge, J-life??"
2,NOT a custom fit to the 2006 Nissan Murano,"The title of this product says it is for the 2006 Nissan Murano, which would lead the buyer to believe that these floor mats are made specifically for this vehicle. But, buyer beware, this is actually a generic mat that you have to cut/shape to fit into your vehicle. The mats have some pre-printed cut lines, but even these are not a match to the vehicle that they are advertized to fit. If you ask me, the title is something close to false advertising."
1,Worst,"Worst piece of crap you can put on a CD ever!!! I was going to include ""rap"" in the previous sentence but that would be giving this CD to much credit. Absolutly no creative thought into the lyrics of any of the Tracks on this album and the subject matter is repetative. How many times can you talk about Money, Jewelry, and women?? DO NOT BUY this product."
1,well what did you expect?,"The Front cover explained the whole album (Bling,Cars and ""Hoes"") and it was no surprise to find only that on the disc. Chingalingalingaling has no talent and he is probably aware of that, and he is inventing his own wuuuuuuuurrrrrrrds which is very low, and i hope to the people that have bought any chingy related products realise soon that there is much better artists out there that deserve the attention !, and why not get sum MJ? ! (he is wotsup!!!)...."
2,Powerballin',"Chingy's followup to 2003's ""The Jackpot"" falls disasterously lower than his debut. Not many of the songs grabbed my attention, his voice gets real annoying after a while too. Don't get me wrong, there are a couple dope songs to bump in your ride but its not worth purchasing the whole cd for them.Hot Tracks:Balla BabyMake That Ass TalkDon't You WorryAll the Way to St. Lou26'sDon't Really CareThe rest of the tracks are way below what my expectations were. Chingy is just another one of those rappers that put out wack music just because he's guarnteed to at least go platnium or even more. It's just rediculous that people would buy this crappy album. Don't even waste your money."
1,Y'AL NEED 2 START LISTENIN 2 REAL HIP HOP NOT THIS GARGAGE!!,Y'AL NEED 2 GET THE KRAYZIE BONE ALBUM AND THE BIZZY BONE ALBUMGemini: Good Vs. Evil IS THE KRAZY BONE ALBUMAND ALPHA AND OMEGA IS THE BIZZY BONE ALBUM.....Y'AL NEED 2 LISTEN 2 REAL HIP HOP .. NOT THIS COMMERCIAL GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,I hate ur style!!!,"Many rappers rap about women, money and death. But at least they do it in a decent way. Chingy only raps about that and the music is terrible. Im glad he failed, he is a disgrace to hiphop."
1,Just to support Mills on this,"This album truly is a 1 star album, hope fully he can go Proof of D12 on us, and rid the radio waves of junk."
1,Dont listen to this clown...,"This guy is by far the worst rapper i've ever heard. All yall need to listen to Jedi Mind Tricks, Immortal Technique, Gangstarr, Killah Priest, and Cannibus... This dude is the typical B-balla rapper, that just sucks horribly. I gave it a 1 because that was the lowest i could. Find some real music ppl."
2,One more Chingy? Hell No!,"I got his last album. [Because it ON SALE]That debut album~His debut is a good party album,quite relax to listen to~But the problem is.....Should I need one more Chingy album?The answer is HELL NO!I Check out this album at local record store,It's no difference with his first album!He take no progress, no improve,So, you don't need to support this one!the only better thing is,this album got few more good songs than his last one!IF you think you need a good party album,and IF you LIKE Chingy style, [I'm sure you're one of Nelly Fans]Just go get it, I'm sure you will think this album is good!But for real hip hop head,Go get some REAL stuff instead!Nah Man!I'm not talking about Eminem, he's sell out!Go get Nas or Snoop New album!"
4,"Chingy Chingy Chingy,","Alright people, this chingy album is pretty good, but its more like jams then rap. chingy left dtp, which was a mistake, even thought i could listen to this album more then ludicris newest album, Chingy did not do his greatest. He only has 1 hit on this album which is balla baby. On his last album he had hit songs called One Call Away, Holidea Inn and Right Thurr. If your a chingy fan, yes i would still recomend that you buy this album. Its not that bad."
1,Rubbish,This album is the worst music I have ever heard.Its hardly even music.Complete rubbish.Listen to real bands like Led Zepplin and The Rolling Stones!!!
3,Hot beats for the party but thats about all,"This cd is not a cd that you're gonna have to think about what Chingy is saying, it's all the same throughout the whole cd. If you don't believe me then look on azlyrics or whatever. But I do have to say that for the party or in the car when you just feel like chillen and relaxing this is right on target. But that's all its meant to be so it's all good."
1,Osama BIn laden please read.,There is one place you could bomb and nobody would of cared. ITS CALLED THE SOURCE AWARDS. We wouldnt be having a war if he wouldve killed all the rappers instead.GO BUY A AMON AMARTH OR SLAYER ALBUM.
1,wow.....,"WRONG! the reviewer before me who gave it five stars is wrong. Not everybody in hip hop raps about the same thing, only awful MC's do. True MC's have diverse content that comes from the heart, not this materialistic garbage. The reason most great artists never sell MILLIONS of albums is because they sacrifice mass appeal for more powerful, meaningful messages that actually require you to think to listen to. a few reviews down, somebody suggested listening to Killah Priest, Gangstarr, and Immortal Technique. Do yourselves a favor and listen to that advice. Please. G-unit and anybody like them are the reasons hip hop is being overshadowed by emo-rock and trash of the sort. Please listen to real hip hop. Go out and Cop ""Moment of Truth"" by Gangstarr, ""Revolutionary Vol.2"" by Immortal Technique, ""Heavy Mental"" by Killah Priest, or ""Violent by Design"" by Jedi Mind Tricks."
2,What Is This?,"When I first heard ""Balla Baby"", I wanted to buy this album in hopes of work just as good but to my disappointment, I was wrong. The songs on here get repetitive and it is very difficult to tell one song from another. The only other songs besides ""Balla Baby"" that stood out were ""Don't Worry"" with Janet Jackson and the ""Balla Baby Remix"". I liked his previous work like ""One Call Away"" and ""Rignt Thurr"" but this album was just not all that great. I just hope he doesn't repeat the same mistake on his next album."
1,Who listens to this stuff?,"Garbage. Crap. Dookie. BS. Call it whatever you want but please don't call it good, unless you're in kindergarden. My little cousin in preschool thinks Chingy is the best rapper right now.Repetitive and lackluster is the format of the album. This album is easily blown out by others, even that new Diplomats one. Chingy come back harder? I think not. THIS album is not worth the time or the effort."
1,Chingy is Destroying Hip Hop,"WAKE UP PEOPLE!! THIS IS NOT HIP HOP! THIS IS HIP POP AND CHINGY DEPENDS ON HIS LOOKS TO SELL RECORDS AND HE DOESNT EVEN HAVE LYRICAL SKILL. HE F*CKING SINGS IN ALL HIS SONGS AND ACTS HARD AS HELL. HES A LITTLE BI*CH WHO SHOULD BE SLAPPED AROUND LIKE NELLY, LUDACRIS AND MURPHY LEE. I HATE HIP POPPERS LIKE HIM AND EVEN NAS SAID ""R&B IS F*CKING THE GAME UP HORRIBLY"" DONT BUY HIS RECORDS I HAVE HIS FIRST ONE AND ALL THOSE SONGS WERE SOOO ANNOYING TO LISTEN TO AND I WAS TORTURE. F*CK YOU CHINGY!!!"
1,Another horrible rap album made for MTV junkies.,"Chingy is one of the worst rappers ever, another talentless buffoon who talks like a jackass when he ""raps"", and loves to add the suffix ""urrr"" to every word he says. He tries his best to impersonate Nelly, but fails miserably. Whoever gave this man a record deal should be slapped. His lyrics are among the worst I've ever heard. Even his name is a joke! He claims Chingy means: ""to be rich or to be a baller"". He's set a new low in music, and he's nothing but a gimmick.His music sucks, but his albums sell. I'll never understand why."
1,OMG NEGATIVE HUNDRED STARS,"This has to be surely amongst the most lame,bland and lousy albums ever.Whover gives this crappy cd anything more than one star needs to see a shrink soon.I would rather chew manure for six straight months than get this dungheap of an album.Get MEDDLE from PINK FLOYD instead."
1,WORST RAPPER EVER,"It's rappers like chingy that give hip hop a bad name, he has no talent, talks about the same old things, and people only like him becuz he has a couple singles with hott beats, but if you listen 2 his lyrics, its all bullsh*t...."
2,not feelin it,I'm not really a fan of chingy's but i liked jackpot. i tried this one and it is a bomb. his flow is nice but his lyrics need work. about four out of 19 songs are good so i got no choice but to give him a 2
2,Nothing Extraordinary,"To me, the best song on this album was ""Don't Worry"" w/Janet Jackson, which I'm sure was really touching for whoever the girl is that he wrote it for. As for the rest album, it is basically the same old ""my crew is better than yours/look at all the money I have/rollin on bigger dubs than you/I get any girl I want and anything I want from them"" format that is found in most of the lyrics of flaky rappers. This album has not shaken my opinion that Chingy is a waste of time. If you want this cd, I would suggest burning it from someone, otherwise, you will be mad that you wasted your money."
1,*yawns* very very untalented and funny,"whoever gave this dude five stars have:1. bad taste in music2. doesn't know real hip hopdon't support this guy along with his STL friends. the funny part about this guy is his voice. if you want a good laugh, listen to his voice. it doesn't sound like a normal rapper. more like a mini nelly on helium. i'm all for rappers sounding different, but he takes that art form and makes a complete a** out of himself. and he looks like a damn monkey on crack. very very ugly. uggggh. so if you want someone with actual talent and doesn't use nursery rhymes, get Canibus."
1,Mills got straight to the point,"Ya, Abomination to God also set it right in his worthy review. I remember the days where this panzy was praised and all of you ate that ""One Call Away"" and ""Right THURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR"" garbage. Does 2 stars explain anything? This apparently is equal to that D4L s***, which is actually the lowest of the low. Anyways, didn't I tell you Chingy would die one year after -Jackpot- hit?Now that he's dead, everybodies focused on T-Pain, OH S***!"
1,why you be going giving our people a bad name?,Chingy's beats are terrible and his lyrics are nauseating and degrading at best. go back to the ghetto you iliterate f***. hey americans you happy you just gave a retard millions of dollars? nice going dumbf*ksive looked through deese 1 star guys who lisen to metal. thank god there are some sane people in your country
4,Good guy.,"I happen to agree with all the reviews that say that the lyrics are crap and the beats are great. Chingy is talentless when it comes to writing lyrics, and some of them aren't even his own (how stupid do you have to be to get other people to write about cash, women and hoes?) but I'm glad he's working on his own now and not just under Ludacris. The beats here are tight, produced by a number of talented producers and old favorites like the Trakstarz. The Trakstarz are awesome and hopefully have a great future ahead of them. Chingy, on the other hand, better do some studying and think up better lyrics (and write his own!!!) b/c I'm starting to get tired of the generic raps about riches and b***hes that so many have used."
3,One thumb UP,"Well... first off.. I can say.. I'm haven't been that BIG of a Chingy fan since he surfaced... but I listened to the whole CD and will try not to be biased. From what I heard so far... Balla Baby is the track that definetly stands out from the rest. The other song that really caught my ear was ""We Do"" which is my favorite track on the album. The album does have some crazy beats that jump around a lot. As I sit here and listen through the tracks again... ""Wurr the Git It Girls At"" is another good jam on the cd. But sadly... all the others don't really sound that great to me. So much for a big review... listen to the tracks on CDNow.com before you buy it.. thats all I can say."
1,Chingy,"I didnt want to give this a rating at all, because I honestly didnt know what this was. Is this music? Judging by the cover I assumed it was either a Master P produced disc, or a Master P produced movie. Ching-A-Ling (<---lol) needs to quit.By the way...does he actually hoot like a owl in that song?"
1,CHINGY NEEDS HIS A$$ kicked in the PowerBalls,"FORGET ""BEHIND THE MUSIC"", CHINGY'S GONNA BE ON VH-1'S ""BEHIND THE COUNTER AT McDONALD'S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Alright, lets try this...","If you think this CD is a pathetic self-parody and you'd rather listen to good stuff like Public Enemy and NWA instead of this POS hit ""yes"".If you think Chingy rules the world and PE and NWA are posers hit ""no"".Lets see how this little experiment goes on...."
1,I've get a new gameplan for everyone on Amazon...,I think it just COMPLETELY goes without saying how heinous Chingy is as a rapper so I won't waste time blabbing about that but I suddenly had this cool idea that us Amazonians need to join in together and do. Ok you notice how the album's average rating is already so low at 2.5 stars right? So the goal now is to get everyone else to keep on giving this a 1 star rating to have the very first album with an actual 1 star AVERAGE! C'mon people we can do it! I have faith in you! Hey I just think it would be pretty friggin' funny for a CD to have a 1 star average dont you? Oh yeah and just in case you forgot...CHINGY SUCKS BIGGIE SIZED D*CK! Later.
1,More like Powerfallin!!,"In that one sentence, I was more creative than Dingy was on his whole CD. There are several problems with this CD. One, he has other featured artists on 10 of his tracks. What's wrong Chadingy, can't do anything without help? Second, the title. If you want powerballin, you go back to the film of my Omaha Burke days where I straight took the rock to the rack at 7-2. Third, nice album cover. Hey, look at me, Ize got ice and women who really like me!!!I was so powerballin in the big O back in the late 80s, it was sick. Not only was I the best 7 foot white center in the metro, I had an attitude that even Judge Judy could stop. I was a mean, lean ballin machine. I also recorded rap albums with my teammates. Our best was, ""Hey Millard South, What up"". We totally faced them like a cheerleader that a dork would ask to prom. So, Challadingy, step off and go play candyland with your 10 year old counterparts."
1,Chingy......you suck!,"wat kind of album is this, of course Ludacris and Nelly are better then Chingy, why did u have to leave DTP? you could've been great, but i guess bobby valentino took ur place. The only song i can listen to is balla baby but all the other songs are crap! i think u should go back to St.Louis and stay there and let other rappers do the rest"
2,I`m A Balla SAY WHAAAAAAAAAATTTtttttttt..........,"THis is another CD this is pure ""Crappy MEss"" in every way possible...He ""degrades"" women every chance he gets and he uses ""money"" to promote him-self, NOT un-ordinary, but this title is a complete waist. THE only way this album is probably selling is cuz JANET JACKSON is on it. OTher than that, I doubt people would cop it. IT doesn't provide much substance for it-self. ""Worst than the first""..."
2,PowerBallin' Critic,"We all known chingy for beign the #1 baller in he's crew DTP. WIth he's expanded beank accounts and the numbers of cars in his garage from his successfull 3*platinum cd Jackpot he can actually brag about stuff that he has. There is a major effort done in the studio to record this album. But chingy's limited book rhyme couldn't really do any honor to the producing part. Even with featuring like janet jackson, r.kelly and the list goes on Powerballin' is not a complete reocord. The good side the dance floor single is on it ball baby. Maybe some chingy fans will probably buy it just to support him."
1,Mills all the Way,"If anyone deserves all 1-star averages more, its Chingy (and Fiddy and D4L).As for this album, well, if generic beats and asinine, childish ""gangsta"" lyrics are your thing, then your obviusly self-induced retarded.Anything is better than this, even a cat being strangled."
3,poor design,"This is a good sized tote for small pets; however, it is of poor design. My pet guinea pig chewed a hole in the mesh after he was in the tote no more than 5 minutes. The quality of the mesh and the placement of the mesh windows can lead to its destruction in no time. Don't waste your money like I did."
5,Term Limits,"Vince Flynn hits the nail on the head! Let's defeat all the ""dragons"" in the voting booth though."
3,"Good fast read, but too much like television ...","I enjoyed this fast reading novel, but found the repetitive character descriptions a bit underwhelming. Plot development was so-so -- did the author forget the President declared martial law? Did Congressman O'Roarke's security detail forget to show up for work? Shouldn't the FBI know the old hair on the suitcase trick?I won't bother with his next novel, probably catch-up on Clancy instead."
1,"-- Unbelievable tripe, conspriracy fodder for militia crowd","If you had a half a star rating (or no star) I would have given it that. I expect this to be a big seller at survivalist shows since it feeds the conspiracy paranoia and distrust of the government common to that crowd. The amount of ""research"" and ""fact"" in the book is on par with that found in most ""men's action thrillers,"" minimal or nonexistent, the characters are flat and stereotypical, as is the portrayal of government and our political process. This book will be a joy to those who feel the ballot box should be replaced by the bullet. Timely it may be, a thriller it ain't, drivel it is.."
3,A Little to Far Out for Me,"I made a huge mistake when I bought this book...I judged it by its cover. I was interested because I thought it would be about an assassination plot where the bad guys would be exposed for the murderers they are. However, this book almost goes so far as to make heros out of the assassins. With out giving anything away, the plot was a little to radical for me especially in light of recent events. Vince Flynn is no Clancy, or Grisham for that matter...not even close."
2,The bad ideas outweigh the good ones,"There's a fine line in vigilantism. It's OK to go after bad guys if they're really evil, and would kill you if they got the chance. On the other hand, killing a politician because he won't balance the federal budget? That's totally unacceptable.I also didn't like the author's assumptions about the military, my branch of service especially. No one in the military talks about bumping off politicians and it's a slur to say they do.When you really get down to it, not only is the book's storyline a slur on the military, do we really want domestic policy dictated by assassination? The overall tone from Mr. Flynn is distant approval of the project of killing big-spending congressional porksters. However, down that road lies Timothy McVeigh, the SLA and the Earth Liberation Front.So, despite its interesting plot, the book is too morally compromised for me to be able to recommend it."
4,A real thriller,"My first Vince Flynn... and I wasted no time following it up by reading his ""Memorial Day"" and ""Transfer of Power."" I like his style. He maintains momentum. Yes, he's not the most eloquent writer, but that's not the focus of his work. I believe he's more concerned with plot movement, and I find his books simply fun. He keeps everything clipping right along. Are all the plot twists plausible? Who would ever know, except CIA, FBI and Secret Service insiders -- and I certainly am not one. I suspect that not all the events are plausible -- particularly the scene toward the end of ""Term Limits"" wherein the former Navy SEAL fellow commits murder right under their noses. But it's still a fun, page-turnin' read."
3,Not really great,This book wasn't at all what I expected. Just didn't have enough thrills for me. Actually I found it boring. Got about half way through and threw in the towel.
3,Good read,"I didn't know this prequel existed, until recently. I purchased the Kindle version because it allows me to enlarge font size. I found the story quite readable, even without Mitch anywhere."
4,What a great idea!,"Except for the fact that they'd just screw it all up again eventually, sometimes a good cleaning of the slate is a necessary and good thing."
4,A dream come true ... haha!,"I sincerely hope the FBI doesn't monitor book reviews, because I have to admit that this book fulfills one of my fantasies (getting rid of corrupt politicians and arrogant power brokers via some old-fashioned covert vigilante justice) and I don't want to end up on some watchlist for saying so.This is a fun, if implausible (did I mention ""fantasy"" already?) political thriller that exposes a lot about the way things are done in Washington ... things most of us have suspected but hoped weren't true. (Well, hopefully people aren't actually getting murdered, but then again, what do any of us know about how it all works?)Even though this is a novel, there's plenty to ponder here, especially since the political climate and economic conditions described in the book are pretty close to the current situation in reality. That's a big part of what makes this an interesting read, especially these days."
3,Expected more,Rated 3 because it was overly simple in its plot and dialogue. Also a bit of a stretch in believability. I like Vince Flynn but I would not consider this one of his better works.
5,Almost too real,"What a great book, this book is almost too real. You could see this being made into a movie except that somone would bring the movie too life. I really loved the fast pace and excitment of the book. Great series"
4,Exciting techno-thriller,"Term Limits is an exciting techno-thriller set in a modern-day political climate remarkably similar to today's, with mounting deficits, bloated spending, and plenty of pork. One side wants to raise taxes and cut spending, the other is enjoying it's cushy political tenure a little too much. A few actions of the dubious heroes stretch the limits of credulity a bit, but if you suspend disbelief for a few hours, you can enjoy the ride."
5,Awesome Book,Vince Flynn is the best. His stories are gripping and really hold your interest. I plan on reading all of his books.
4,Clancy's Less Verbose Partner,Flynn can tell an almost believable yarn without the excessive technical detail (ad nauseum) of Clancy. A fun read every time with suspense and a gripping style for the light reader.
5,Excellent read,"Having read all of Flynn's books, I am now reading them in order of story, these books are entertaining even the second time around..."
5,This is a page turner,"This book is thoroughly enjoyable if you like the political thriller genre. The details are pretty good, but the action keeps you going. This book is a great read."
3,Not Exactly Impressed,"Elements are here for a great book. Plot is strong, but motive is weak. Renegade Congressman assasin is barely believable."
4,A feel-good novel for our times,"TERM LIMITS will appeal to those who think that most technothrillers unrealistically portray the government as full of selfless public servants. As in UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES by John Ross, the protagonists of this novel take creative and daring steps to make the statist government slugs realize just how very vulnerable they are. My only real complaint about this work is the author's decision to have the heroes be members of the Special Forces. The military is the last place you'd look for individual freedom, and career soldiers have actively chosen to live in this culture of control. If Flynn had made his protagonists a handful of fed-up civilians, it would have been much more plausible. If you can set aside this glaring lapse of logic, this book will make you chuckle, and you'll probably finish it in one sitting."
3,Lots Of Action But Very Implausible!,"Term Limits is a good first effort from Vince Flynn and I plan to read his other novels. The book is filled with action, which makes you turn the pages at an increasingly fast rate. For me, however, the plot, while interesting, went somewhat over the limit to which I am willing to extend belief. Further, none of the characters -- both the supposedly ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" -- are ones you care much about and it's often hard to distinguish between the good and the bad. As a result, I thought Term Limits is worthy of reading but only deserving of a ""good/3 star"" rating."
4,Term Limits Review,"Term Limits is very much in tune with the current situation in the US. The politicians have put their wishes to remain in office and impose their ideology ahead of the good of the country. The solution, as seen by a commando group, is to impose their own version of ""term limits"" on the out of control politicians."
4,Timeless Political Thriller!,"Although written in 1997, the political scene could be today. The characters are tightly drawn and the plot is well conceived. Corruption and back room deals are rampant, with the politicians more concerned with being reelected than with balancing the budget. Sound familiar? Like Tom Clancy Vince Flynn has the inner workings of government and clandestine operations down pat. Having read all his books, I wasn't disappointed in this debut novel."
4,Political Scandal,"When reading this book, you need to throw reality out the door to some extent, but it is still a highly entertaining read. Three high ranking politicians are assassinated for various reasons, and congressman Michael O'Rourke finds himself in the middle of the mess. It all goes back to an operation that was blown years back thanks to a politician who couldn't keep his mouth shut.Most Vince Flynn fans are very familiar with Mitch Rapp, who does not appear in this book. However, there are a lot of characters here who make appearances in his other novels. Not required reading if you want to read about Mitch, but still worth the time just the same."
4,A good read overall,"I had no idea that Library Journal and Kirkus Reviews were such Liberal rags. This is a political thriller that isn't afraid to point the finger at the political corruption run rampant in our nation's capitol.DC is not self policing and this book is an interesting take on some patriots taking action. Is the action morally acceptable? Read it and decide for yourself. If you love our country and the Constitution, you will enjoy this book. It keeps a steady pace, most of the characters are fairly well developed, but a few are generic comic book characters that weaken the story somewhat.I finished it and scooped up the rest of Flynn's books the next day at a flea market."
4,Term Limits,"My first read of a ""Vince Flynn"" book. I am hooked. Very entertaining with great insight into Washington politics. Vince Flynn is on my list to buy books."
5,A Great Read,"Lots of action, a riveting plot, and many interesting characters make this thriller an easy read. Not to mention that the plot seems to be something that could happen; it feels that realistic."
4,Vince Flynn Mystery,A great mystery for today but written 7 years ago. The ending is masterful. A must read novel for those who believe in our Forefathers and the Constitution but your values may be torn; just think of the revolution!
4,"Exciting story, scary plot",I really liked Term Limits. The story kept me interested and involved. I liked the level of detail the author used and he made it all seem plausible to me. The fact that the good guys were good and bad at the same time gave me an uneasy feeling and you can't help but come away from the book with mixed feelings. I liked the ending; it kept me in suspense as the loose ends were wrapped up. I've recommended the book to my friends.
1,Awful. And I am a Tea Party / Objectivist,Assassinating corrupt politicians? Why not? After all our country started out with a bloody revolution. That seems to be the theme of the book. Minor distinctions like declaring war first (Declaration of Independence anyone?) Pah. And the writing is abysmal. The only description Flynn can come up with for the female love interest is 'big brown eyes'. He says that over and over and over. Flynn is barely literate. He needs a book on English grammar or an editor who has a book on English grammar. Or a shredder.
2,Half baked product,"A potentially fascinating story ruined by exaggeration far beyond common sense, long-winded and boring language, and simplistic thinking.This half baked product demeans the term ""best seller""..."
2,Terrible Dialogue but a interesting plot keeps you reading..,"I knew from page 1 that this was a badly written book. The dialogue was just wooden. The characters were often poorly drawn and not well thought out. The President is a buffoon. However, the story is intriguing and I read until the end to find out what happens. The real question is, does Vince Flynn find an editor who can help him in his next book? I'm not sure if I want to read another 500 pages or more to find out."
2,No sale,"If you can't buy into the premise - or even just go along with it, after all, it's only a story - then you cannot really enjoy the ride. That sums up my feelings about this book.Some of the characters - particularly the President - were too clueless to be believed.The author does deserve credit for the extensive research on the tools of the CIA, FBI, and Navy SEALS. But there were too many characters and subplots to wade through too make for a good ending; too many loose ends to tie up.I like the genre, but can't recommend this one."
3,Entertaining but strange,"Flynn obviously did his research for this one. The special ops type of assassinations are well planned and executed in the difficult environment of Washington, D.C. The reasons for wanting to rid Congress of the unethical and criminal legislators are understandable and agreeable. But the means are unpalatable. The book is fiction and so the killings are not real, but Flynn's is a strange viewpoint, as reflected by his main characters. I say that education and the ballot box are the appropriate means for purging the Congress, not the rifle. The rifle is appropriate for self-defense, but not for turning the real and present scum out of office. The book, a big read, is worth the time, however, and you won't be able to put it down. I found myself wanting the lead assassin to survive."
2,Term Limits,"While putting out a contract on certain members of Congress may be a unique idea on how to straighten out our government, it is still a bit of a stretch to do it in the ways that are described in this book."
3,slow on the beginning,"ok,but doesn't catch your attention at beginning like most vince flynn novels,prefer the mitch rapp stories.would recommend read because of the possible scenerios about how our goverment officials take american people for granted vince does have a great resource for his materials"
5,Term Limits by Vince Flynn,I really enjoy political thrillers and Vince Flynn hits the nail on its head with this one. I have read several of his novels and they are all wonderful. I would recommend this and any of his novels to anyone. Great book!
4,Captures much of what's wrong in politics today!,"Very entertaining read! Although a work of fiction, it makes you think of what's wrong with our present system... makes me want to read the rest of the series."
5,Better Then Clancy,A first rate political thriller! The best fiction I have read of any kind since The Bourne Indentity. If anything is ever impossible to put down this is it.My nonfiction books will be put aside until I get my fill of Mr. Flynn's great stories.In Term Limits the good guys and the bad guys are hard to tell from one another. Much like Congress today. Hang on for a great ride.
3,Mixed Emotions,"A good read, but one is asked to stretch ones imagination more than once. Then again that is what ficton is all about.The author manages to get across some fundamental economic messages, which, in his view, is what is failing the western democratic economies.I also enjoyed the descriptions of inside the beltway. I read this book becasue a friend has recommended the Mitch Rapp series and I thought I would read this first as an introduction."
5,An outstanding read!!!,"I have been hearing about Vince's writing for quite some time. I had started this book, got one chapter in, and while doing a major renovation on my house misplaced the book. I found it again and re-read the first chapter and didn't put it down until I finished. A very compelling story. The details regrading various military actions that take place throughout the story are extremely accurate. I imagine I'll be reading this book again!"
5,David & Goliath of Political thrillers,"I am as peaceful man as you would ever want to meet, but Mr. Flynn's Term limits is about taking out evil where we all know where evil exists. The pace is exhausting and the characters are so believable that you can actually put faces to the names. After I read the reveiws from Library Journal and Kirkus Reviews I knew I had to write a review. These professional reviews are stamped with the Progressive stamp of disapproval. Close minded and and sheep pellets littered throughout the reveiws.A big thumbs up for Mr. Flynn."
4,Political Thriller,"After assassinating three powerful and corrupt politicians, a paramilitary group demands that the U.S. president and congress reform the government or face more deaths. In the mix is freshman congressman and former marine Michael O'Rourke who correctly guesses the identity of the group's leaders and tries to stop them. This political thriller has violence and some strong language."
5,Very compelling and gripping! MUST READ!,I was drawn in my the premise on the back and I was so happy to read it. I stayed up nights just find out what happened next and it was good. It was a little predictable in a few areas but it was mostly a suspenseful. I want to read his other books.
2,Implausible,"This was my first Vince Flynn book. I did not enjoy the book at all. I started this series after recommendations by fans of Lee Child (Reacher series). I'll try the next one in the series to see if it improves.Without giving away any spoilers, the plot strained credulity. I cannot believe that the main protagonist expressed the views and acted the way he did.Very strange indeed."
2,POV.....,"I'm annoyed with bad writing... I have never read a Flynn book before and I only hope that his next few aren't nearly as poorly written as this one was... It was littered with POV errors all the one through... Who ever was the chief editor on this should be fired... To write is human, to edit, is divine..."
5,This Book Was Hard to Put Down,"When a friend handed this book to me, he only stated that it was a 'good read.' That was an understatement. The first chapter pulls you in with clock-like action that sets the momentum for the rest of the book. Having some familiarity with the military, I was pleasantly suprised with the level of detail the author put into his writing. The details are rolled out very smoothly, integrated well with the story line. After I finished it, I went out and bought the author's next two books. It was hard to believe that this was his first novel."
5,Got me hooked,When I first picked up this book I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not. Sure at first it started out kinda slow but the pace picked up before you realized four hours passed by without you lifting your head up to see around you. The way Vince Flynn describes his characters you can picture in your mind clearly of what they would look like. Once your nearing the end you know how every character is going to react to a conversation.The book starts picking up when the assassinations start to take place. You will find yourself rooting for some characters and hoping the other dies a horrible painful death. If you decide you want to start reading some Vince Flynn book's. Then try this one first. They all sort of tie into each other in a cool way.Best book I read in a long time!
3,Thrill an hour,I must walk at a faster pace than the other reviewers because I had a hard time finishing this book. We are all well aware of Mr Flynns viewpoints on whats wrong with our country. We only had to read it every chapter! Its amazing he had room for a plot...which was both horrifyingly plausible and ridiculous at the same time. That part elevated the book to 3 stars from my initial two.
4,A must read!,"This is an exciting fast moving read. I found it gripping, and at the same time politically enlightening. I think it is a must read for every productive US citizen. I can't believe this 1997 book was not written in 2009-2010. It is so full of suspense; it's difficult to put down. I look forward to reading more Vince Flynn!"
4,Love These Thrillers,After having read several of this series of books; I find I can hardly put the books down. There have been nights when I've read these books into the middle of the night.
4,GREAT POLITICAL THRILLER,Received this book from a great couple I met on Martha's Vineyard - we did a book swap- I got the better deal. Enjoyed the story and chararters. I am looking for the movie version!!!Gave the book to my father -- waiting his opinion--he's tough!!!
2,Close but no cigar.,At times the story takes predictable turns and the detail of the scenes lacks what would be needed for the story line to make sense.
1,A Joke--cut-rate Clancy for morons.,"I can't believe anyone actually liked this dreck...True, I can see where Joe America might relate to bumping off the Ted Kennedys in D.C., but let's face it, this should be real life we're dealing with. I cannot in all good conscience recommend this to anyone with an I.Q. over 75. Stick with Jack Ryan--at least Clancy can construct a readable sentence!"
1,This book is almost too terrible to comment on!,"To say this book is beneath contempt is kind. If you accept the position that you can kill anyone you don't like then this is your book. To begin with, the FBI wouldn't investigate murder, that's local and state area, and then to present the position that if a politician is crooked you can kill him, no problems with the law, that's just absurd. Save your money, not worth your time."
5,"Excellent Book, Dealing with Honor in a nation with none.","In a nation that was created by men with honor and valor we now find ourselves without much of either. Mr. Vince Flynn writes a story that any true American Patriot will enjoy. Reading about an honorable man in a job of public service actually serving his nation with care and honor. Michael O'Rourke is an man of true Honor and Valor and has served his Country in Battle. Little did he know that the real battle was yet to come. American's who love their country will enjoy this book as the outcome has twists and turns but in a world where the bad guys win, it is refreshing to see Good Triumph over Evil. Righteousness succeed over self interests. I would rate this book 5 out of 5 stars. Recommended reading for anyone with any Patriotic or Political interests what-so-ever. Wonderful Book. Way to go Mr. Vince Flynn for your masterpiece."
5,Great book,"Another great hit from Vince Flynn. The story line is good, character buildup is very good and overall I loved the book. I would love to see it turned into a movie."
3,"Engaging and fun, if far-fetched and implausible","I don't pretend to be a literary critic. For that matter, I don't even read a great deal. That is probably why I enjoyed this book so much. The writing is taught with just enough details to keep things interesting. If you have right-wing leanings you will enjoy it far more than if you are a leftie. What struck me most about this book is how timely the issues are and how the personalities in the book absolutely mirror those in the current administration (though this book was written years ago). I haven't really read any political/espionage books other than Ken Follett in my high school days thirty years ago and a bit of Tom Clancy about fifteen years ago. I find Vince Flynn's books to be entertaining and relatively quick reads (even at 600 pages). The pacing is good and you will not want to stop reading. I wouldn't confuse Flynn's books with literary masterworks, but they are a fun ride."
1,Righteous Congressman Condones Political Assasination,Righteous Minnesota representative angry at the government knows who killed four sleazy Members of Congress but only tells his girlfriend and his killer grandfather. What a sleazeball. Simplistic yarn.
1,"""Term Limits""","This book, ""Term Limits"" by Vince Flynn was never received.Carleton B. WaldropPullman, WAAS OF AUGUST 13, 2010 THIS BOOK HAS STILL NOT BEEN RECEIVED.Carleton B. WaldropPullman, WA"
1,Thankfully this Plot is Totally Unrealistic,"If guys like Steve Coleman, Michael O'Rouke (or his grandfather) were truly in charge, this world would be in real trouble. The problem with Vince Flynn and other Gordon Liddy-types is that there is no gray area for them. You are either a military-bred patriot who looks at killing a pleasurable requirement for democracy, or else you are a liberal Frenchy who will doom the world to communal abyss. The simpleton writing Flynn employs here will certainly appeal to the talk radio set. But the plot reminds me of something a overzealous junior ROTC kid would put togetehr. If the Founding Fathers were truly stupid enough to leave our government vulnerable to right wing nut jobs like the O'Rouke's, we'd have found it out a long time ago.Good book club material for the lower reading group. Garbage beyond."
1,A dangerous book,"The fact that the hero of Term Limits, a young Minnesota politician, condones and abets the assassination of ""corrupt"" politicians is symptomatic of a sick society that spawns violence from Waco to Columbine. Mr Flynn seems to have learned little at his Catholic Liberal Arts College. Instead he preaches a dangerous philosophy that rank him right up there with rap singers calling for the murder of policemen. There are no consequences for the assassins in this book and that, too, should be condemned. I give this book a well-deserved thumbs down."
1,A Dangerous Book,"Picking up a couple of paperbacks at the library for a trip, I started reading Term Limits on the plane and soon looked carefully to see when it was published. I thought it came out of the tea party movement but was surprised to see it was published in 1997. It is full of the same paranoia and the righteousness of the extreme right. The heroes of this book are assassins who murder politicians they disagree with. That is as unAmerican as you can get, and yet that is what the rhetoric of some on the right (Michael Savage, for example) is leading toward. I don't think that most tea party members want to see Obama and Pelosi assassinated, but feeble-minded readers of extremist trash like this may see the glorification of the assassins as the trigger they need to do their patriotic duty. This is a dangerous book, and I am appalled by how many Amazon reviewers love the story and don't comment on the immorality of the story line."
2,Nothing special,"This was an easy read, but it was a cheap thrill. None of the characters resonated with me; indeed, they all seemed one-dimensional. Where was the vice president during all this? Did the politicians get the message? We have no idea if they decided to shape up."
2,'Another tale of politicians and commandos',"You would think that I would have enjoyed this book; afterall, the protagonist has the same name as I. By the very truth of it, however, this book bored the devil out of me. If you are reading this book as your first novel of this genre, well, then, you may love it. For me, this book offered nothing new; the characters are typical; the dialogue is weak and paltry; there are too many 'covert-commando' cliches, and the plot is the same old 'political-thriller' rubbish. The book is trendy and fits into the mold of 1990 fiction. If you are looking for something new, something creative and different, I advise reading another tale."
4,Very Much Enjoyed It,"This is my first Vince Flynn book. He was recommended to me by a friend as I love the political spy thriller genre. I very much enjoyed Flynn's writing style and was pleased to see he gives enough details to set the scene and elaborate on the characters but, unlike Clancey Flynn does not go on ad nauseum about things. I will be reading more Flynn novels."
4,Great Entertainment,"This book was Flynn's first novel and it is a highly enjoyable read. Full of characters from Special Forces, White House officials, Congress, the press, FBI, and CIA it is a riveting adventure story about a fictional Washington that has seemingly gone mad, but makes the reader wonder how much of what we read is perhaps not so far removed from reality. An entertaining tale, and very well written."
3,It's Okay,"Not real believable, not too exciting. It's Okay. If you like conspiracy theories, this is for you. I will not be reading more of Mr. Flynn's work."
4,good book,I am a fan of Vice Flynn writing style. this was an early book and has a slow start but is heating up 45% thru and beginning to peak my interest. Loved his later books and follow the series. My mistake I didn't read them in sequence as I didn't do my homework and discover the series flow so now I have to go back and read the last three earliest books but that won't dampen my interest as they are so well written.
4,New author fav,"Flynn had been suggested as an author I would enjoy, so I was glad I started with the first of the series. Enjoyed it enough that I will go on with the series."
4,Entertaining First Effort -- Not for Commies or Traitors,"The Library Journal's review of this book is so blatantly biased as to be laughable. Who are these people anyway? Moving on.... this book, while not the most realistic story Flynn has written, presents the themes of service, honor, and personal responsibility that he carries on throughout his later books. Perhaps that's what irritated the Commies at Library Journal..... Anyway, lighten up, everyone: it's a novel, and a pretty good story at that. It certainly held my interest. If you're reading these reviews to see whether it will hold yours as well, if you had simply purchased the book and started reading, you'd know by now."
4,Muy Bien,The book was great even though I like Mitch better. I do believe that it's a little wordy. Has a great story line. I am going to EBAY to buy the rest of Flynn's book and leaving for Matzatalan to spend a week reading them.La Quinta Por Favor. Yes its worth the price.Hasta Las VistaSenior Hickey
2,"good start, disappointing ending","I always like a book where people go after the government (little guys go up against big guys), but this book manages to take a theme that I am pre-disposed to like, and wreck it. There is some good action (hence the 2 star rating), but the thing that destroys this book is the lack of resolution at the end. Maybe there is going to be a sequel (???), but frankly, getting ripped off by a poor ending means I am unlikely to buy another book by this author.What I mean by this is the very reason that the group goes after the government (to make it balance the budget -- yeah even that is a little lame) is not resolved. Yes, there is plenty of neat action and so on, but after all the expenditure of energy and ordnance, does the budget get balanced? No answer to this left me feeling thoroughly ripped off and angry.Readers who are predisposed to enjoy this type of genre should go buy John Ross' ""Unintended Consequences"" instead."
5,A political thriller and then some!,"Fast paced and easy to read, this book will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through. Vince Flynn creates a provocative, but plausible option for dealing with corrupt politicians in order to bring about government reform. All of the power brokers in Washington are hoping they themselves are not the next target. A page turner you won't be able to put down. An incredible debut book! Watch out Tom Clancy!"
3,"An interesting , thought provoking analysis of true governme","Mr.Flynn has written a very fast pace novel of intrigue, suspence and technical thrilling adventure. My only negative thought about the story line is that Flynn bases his characters actions on the ideals of forcing Congress to pay off the National debt and balance the budget. What he has failed to understand is that the only way to pay off the National debt would be to abolish the Federal Reserve Act, resore the Constitutionally mandated gold and silver based currency our Republic was founded upon, and to force Congress and the American public to become debt free as well as accountable for current and future government growth. This by its nature would reduce government and make ""We the People"" take our responsibilities more serious as well as hold our selves accountable for our actions in the ballot box."
3,Interesting Premise,"A very easy read. It's premise (changing America one politician at a time) will disturb liberals and those who adore our government. Some of the characters are easy to identify (i.e. Senator Fitzgerald - a hard drinking overweight womanizing liberal Democrat politician from New England.... gee, guess who this is supposed to be?). I await Flynn's next novel."
4,Coffee Urn,Works good but does take longer to perk than what is listed in the instructions. Coffee grounds do seep out into coffee but was easily fixed by using a regular coffee filter.
4,good for the price,"Bought this to only be used a few times a year, and I think it will work well for that. It feels a little cheap, but the price is a lot cheap. The coffee it makes is OK. Admittedly, it was for a picnic and I used a hose to fill it. The only thing you should be aware of if you've never used one of these is that it takes a long time to make a pot of coffee. One minute per cup. I think this is pretty standard though and not a fault of this machine. I'd recommend it for occasional use."
1,piece of junk!,This coffee maker is a piece of junk. Use twice and stop working would not recommend to purchase!I'll read reviews on items from now on!
3,12-42 cup Perc period.,"We've been using this model for years, mostly because it's cheap. A bit flimsy in construction, strainer allows too many grounds to settle in bottom. Good enough for the price; we'll buy another one."
3,Does the job.,"We purchased the West Bend 58002 to make coffee for a program of adults that averages 15-25 people per day. This coffee maker provides good tasting coffee for the individuals and brews in a timely manner. Cleaning the coffee maker at the end of the day is easy. The cost was ok. We really didn't like the plastic filter cup but were unaware that is was not a metal filter when we bought it. We also would have preferred a coffee maker with an on/off switch, rather than just plugging and unplugging it for power. Overall, it does a good job for our needs and we would recommend it to others."
3,Hamilton Beach 42-Cup Coffee Urn is better,"I needed two coffee urns for a large gathering and found two that seemed to fit my needs - the West Bend and theHamilton Beach 40515 42-Cup Coffee Urn, Silver. I decided to purchase one of each.The Hamilton Beach blows the West Bend out of the water. It is much larger and better built.Though they both are advertised as 42-cup, the Hamilton has a 10.5 liter capacity, while the West Bend only has a 7 liter capacity. That's 3.5 liters more (1.5x larger) than the West Bend - that's a huge difference!And finally, the West Bend just feels really cheap and flimsy. The Hamilton feels much more sturdy.Hamilton wins this one hands down."
2,Not hot enough,"I give it 2 stars because it still may be good for coffee (even though for my taste still not hot enough), but we used it just for hot water to prepare tea, and the water is not hot - actually it never boils, and also you can add like a liter of cold water into it and it will still not switch on the heating. And it feels like it even got worse with the time (since April when I purchased it). Finally, we dropped it somehow and broke three of the legs... So we are trashing it now."
2,Dented,Came as scheduled...first box - fine - not rips or tears. Inside box - fine - no damage. Coffee maker - BIG dent on the right side a little below half way up...you know what? It still makes pretty good coffee! Looks aren't everything and we need coffee!
4,"makes good coffee, but takes 2 hours","Just as I said in the title, this thing does what it is supposed to do,, except really slow. Not a problem if you plan for it. Use course ground coffee, fill the bucket with water, turn it on - and wait for 2hrs. Then you have 42 cups of jo that stays hot for a long time."
3,"Well made, But....","We bought this product thinking it would fit where we wanted to use it. Despite our measuring, it turned out to be too long and too narrow for the space. It is well-made, however. The toughest part of the whole thing has been that the seller has absolutely refused to respond to us by either email or phone calls despite our repeated attempts to try to negotiate a return. We are NOT impressed with playkids.com."
2,"Waste of money, Rated X??? Try PG -13 at the most.","I suppose someone who simply wants to watch two women in bikini tops and boy shorts, often with t-shirts over top too, fake wrestle in oil might appreciate this dvd, it takes all kinds I suppose. But if you are expecting any type of nudity as the description infers, ""wardrobe malfunctions"", you won't get any. This looks like it was filmed as a side show at some sort of convention center exhibition. There are actually families and children in the sparse crowd watching and in one of the bouts they even have a young boy, early teens at the most, from the crowd putting the oil on one of the girls. Kind of creepy I thought. Boring dvd!"
5,Essential bluegrass album; the real stuff,"I used to have an old tape of these that a friend made from his LP's; I cannot believe it took me so long to replace it with a CD. What was I thinking?Hazel Dickens is a national treasure. This is an absolutely wonderful CD and a must-have for anyone who even thinks they might like bluegrass. No prissy singing here: These women both have beautiful, strong, voices. The songs are great, the harmonies are great, the instrumentation is great (first-class accompanists and arrangements).This isn't a great ""women's bluegrass album"", it's one of the great bluegrass albums, period."
5,Pioneering Women of Bluegrass Review,This is a great bluegrass recording. It is raw and you can feel the emotion in the singing. I also really enjoyed the banjo playing on a number of the pieces. This recording is worth every penny spent.
4,Good Stuff,"I've been using this with my Russian tortoise for several months now and it's great stuff. For me it was a process to figure out how to prepare it so my tortoise will eat it. What proved to be the most successful was to get a couple of pellets and put them in the lid. Put some water in the lid and wait. When the pellets absorb the water, I spread the grass on kale, carrot, mustard, collard, whatever. He eats it every time. Hopefully this helps someone."
5,Awesome!!,I recently brought a little girl Russian Tortoise into my home. I was worried she might be picky and not like this food so I bought the 15oz jar of this product but she seems to love it! I moisten a few pellets with spring water which makes them soft and fall apart for easy consumption. What's also great about this product is that it's high in fiber. I will definitely be ordering more when I run out!
4,Great addition to the fresh vegetables,"This is nice product with minimal soy and lots of grasses that my tortoise needs. Just remember to add a little water so it falls apart. I put this in a ziploc bag and then shake it with the greens I give my tortoise so she eats it. At first when it was on the side, she wouldn't touch it. Now I mix it with everything else and she loves it. It is also a good value compared to the smaller containers."
2,My Sulcata tortoises wont eat it,I wanted these as a compliment to the Romaine lettuce I feed them but they tasted it the first 2 days and never ate it again. I bought the big jar and am left with it full. I would recommend you try a small jar first with your pet just in case.
3,Hard To Say!,"My two Russian tortoises wouldn't touch this stuff, no matter how I tried to feed it to them. It seems like a nice product though..."
1,Tortoise and owner not happy,"I have been utilizing the ZooMed Forest food for several years with my tortoise, no issues. I purchased 4x32 oz. containers of the same food I have been using. Tortoise will not eat from three of the 4 packages. Looks ok but smells moldy and stale. Tried to contact seller through what I thought was there customer service link, but they have no record of my purchase...who knows, not happy."
3,Good and bad,"Okay, this one read like a playground seesaw. Sometimes it was really good. The new feats and prestige classes were amazing. But sometimes it was just plain bad. Jander Sunstar is listed as Chaotic Evil, though his description in his novel and short stories, as well as the description in this book, show him as noble and self-sacrificing. He's also missing MANY feats. To top this off, the adventure ideas in the book aren't really very imaginative. Overall, the book is worth the money for the feats and prestige classes, alone. Just don't expect much more."
5,Real Women..Real Stories,"My boyfriend bought this book for me as a birthday gift, and I must say I was glad he did. Reading and becoming a fly into the lives of these women was better than watching Nip Tuck or Sex and The City or that crazy Flava Flav! They told ALL their business and secrets and left NOTHING out! Lying, back stabbing friends, mother-daughter relationships gone bad, raising kids, affairs, he said..she said, it's ALL in this book! Men and women will LOVE it! A perfect and easy TEN!!!"
5,Great Book,"I thought this book might get boring because I thought it would be hard to relate to 40 and 50 year old women since I'm only 19. I was surprised to find that I could not put the book down. I would sit at my desk at work and be laughing out loud making everybody wonder ""what is she reading?"". I usually get tired of reading a book after the tenth page but I finished this book and wanted more. I can't wait for the Mister Gumbo to come out!"
1,Eau de Aqua Net?,"Clean Ultimate just smells like hairspray to me. Maybe it's just that fragrances smell different on different people, but I kept trying to wash this off my wrists.The original Clean fragrance is wonderful, though. Smells soapy and shower-fresh, not heavy or perfumey."
3,Limited to TFT users only,I thought this book was well written and well organized. My only problem was that it is seems only useful to those who have been trained in tft algorithms - not very useful for eft users. But: if you ARE trained in TFT I would highly recommend the book to clinicians who wish to use tft in practice.
5,Best bra for me,"Bras are a very personal item and I recommend trying different styles that are properly fitted before ordering online. I've been wearing these bras for at least 6 years and they work well for my 59yo body. In size 40C there are 3 rows of hooks which adds to the support. Recently, they finally improved the clip that holds the adjustable straps so they don't slip out of position. To address another review: no, they are not for aerobic activity. I wear a good workout bra for jogging or workouts. I suspect that if you are over a D cup you will need a different style.I now order from Amazon because they have a good price and other sites require you order $50 or more to get free shipping."
4,most comfortable straps I've found,"Bra shopping is like jeans or swimsuits--just slightly better than having a root canal. When you find one that works, you want several in all colors so you won't have to go through it again anytime soon! This bra fits the bill, I have two and plan to get more soon. Worth the money. Comfortable to wear all day, and the straps are heavenly-no shoulder ""dents"" or discomfort and well-placed. Only negative I've found is the back closure is stiff material and scratchy--but it goes away after a few washings. Highly recommended."
5,Beautiful yet low cost bras,The Vanity Fair bras have beautiful styles and comfort. I need the underwire and wide straps for full support. No other bra that I have tried give me the perfect fit I look for in my bra. With each laundering they hold their shape and I can count on having these bras for a long time.
3,2 versions,"recently brought this DVD and contrary to what people have said my copy definitely does have 2 versions of the film on it - the cut version and the uncut night child version (it is not stated on the cover thou), although I admit that it certainly not re-mastered and the quality is not great"
3,What the Peeper Saw is not a 2 version DVD!!,"Dispite what Amazon is advertising above, this is not a Two Version DVD. You will only receive the U.S. Theatrical version of this movie. The Uncut ""Night Child"" version is not on the DVD.The movie is ok although it is a bit odd and the latter part of the movie is hard to follow."
4,What The Peeper Saw. A Brief Review,"What The Peeper Saw, aka. ""Night Child"", is the story of a troubled boy with a genius IQ, who, upon his arrival home from boarding school, immediately begins to plant the seeds of suspicion and distrust between his father and new stepmother. Marcus, played by Mark Lester, proves to be an extremely dangerous child, who won't hesitate to kill anyone he simply dislikes. There is a great deal of sexual tension between Marcus and his young stepmother (Britt Eklund). The ending is a total surprise. I believe that you'll find this film interesting as well as somewhat disturbing."
4,"So, what the peeper saw?","A young stepmother obsessed with intention to disclose her husband's first wife death case interacts with pre-teen sex-obsessed stepson with twists unexpected.A really interesting story, nice performing - all but a technical presentation of a modern DVD film version, EXTRAS-short, poor visually and cut to an extent of ruining a very plot of."
1,"Sorry, Jack, but not for this SF fan.","Vance's SF is great. I read Vance because it's about men with morals, men with strength, men who have goals and follow precepts of decency and justice. But this story about a sick kid raping children is not for me. I'll stick with reading his SF."
2,Slow paced.,This book took me forever to read. I couldn't get into it. Way to slow paced for me. Not one I would recommend.
3,Worth seeing,"This movie was different in many ways, beautiful to watch and pretty cool in general. I would have given it a 3.5 stars if that were an option. Many parts were pretty predictable but it was still worth buying and seeing."
4,The Blue Butterfly DVD,"The Blue Butterfy, was amazing. our family loved it... colorful, and heartwarming to be sure"
5,The Blue Butterfly,I chose this rating because it was such a great picture. A sleeper that had a wonderful story. The acting was very good. I recommend it to everyone who is looking for a heart warming story.
4,Blue Butterfly,"The Blue Butterfly is a wonderful movie, that would bring a sense of hope to young people, too young to fall into the pessimistic, realist world. Belief has helped humanity to conquer millions of ailments. This little boys belief that the blue butterfly is magic, enabled him to follow his beliefs, which led him to full recovery. The story line was great."
4,A Magical Film appropriate for Children and Adults,"A terminally ill boy who is interested in entomology dreams thathis life will be changed if he can just see and capture a rare Blue Morph butterly that inhabits the rain forests...so he persuades a leading Canadian scientist to take him and his mother on the mission.William Hurt is outstanding in the role of an imperfect man who cares for the ill boy in a fatherly way...perhaps to undo the psychological damage he foolishly inflicted on his own daughter who he abandoned to continue his scientific pursuits. All the acting is exceptional but the real ""star"" is the Costa Rican rain forest itself. This film displays beautiful and moving pictures of this colorful world of insects, frogs, and plants. Although the plot is formulaic, the movie succeeds in touching our hearts and souls. I have no difficulty recommending it for the whole family."
4,"""Everything Is The Blue Butterfly""","'The Blue Butterfly' is based on a true story about a terminally ill ten year old boy who is granted his dying wish to go to the Amazon and try and capture the elusive blue butterfly. Added by a reknowned entomologist and his loving Mother the journey of a lifetime begins and before its conclusion everyone involved discovers there's more to life than any of them could have ever imagined.A film to be enjoyed by the entire family. Moving, Uplifting, Mystical and Inspiring!Starring; William Hurt, Pascale Bussieres and Marc Donato."
5,Beautiful both inside and outside,"This movie is very touching and will open your heart, mind, and spirit to what it means to be truly alive. This is based on a true story about a young boy dying with terminal cancer whose only wish is to see the extremely rare and beautiful blue butterfly. The only person who can take him though, is a scared and self-centered entomologist who doesn't want to go and is very pessimistic.After great persistence, the entomologist agrees to take the boy, and what transpires is a spiritual journey for both of them that neither can ever fully explain with words.Chris Cadehttp://www.Spiritual-Short-Stories.com"
2,The Blue Butterfly,"It was the same as any other story similar to many others and I thought the insects were computerized.... Nice story BUT has been done many times,in many movies..."
1,Cheesy,"I watched this movie expecting it to be a heartwarming adventure. It ended up being a sentimental load of crap. It was so bad, as my eight-year-old sister said, ""I wish the boy would have died of cancer!"" The bugs were cool, but it was boring, and the plot smelled like a stink bug. I would rather have gone to the dentist. The best part was the credits. Save yourself the trouble, and don't watch this movie."
2,Very disappointing,"I purchased this book with the hopes of an anthology of the work by Seigfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen and others. While these writers (along with Issac Rosenberg and rupret Brooke) are included, there is very little by way of their poetry.Rather, the book is written for much younger readers (from say, grades 3 - 6) providing an overview of the First World War giving some attention to the lives and work of these poets, but very little by way of complete poems by any of them.I have to give it 2 stars, as the book has some merit; however it is certainly not what I had anticipated. For those interested in a more representative anthology that includes the complete poems of these men, I recommend Candace Ward's _World War One British Poets_."
5,You can't call yourself a music fan if you don't own this CD,"This CD has one song that you can't get anywhere else, and that's the Original Ebin recording, and let me tell you, it's totally worth it. 40 Oz blew me away at a time when all the grunge music was overspilling from the radio. This CD is one of the best all time. There is something it lacks. As it was picked up by the major label and released nationally, they took a song off - Get Out! For some reason they threw on a different version on ""Second-hand Smoke"". If you own 40 OZ., this CD is still worth getting because of Ebin, the other extras you can pick up amongst Second-Hand Smoke and other ""throw-it-together"" CDs they've released since the passing of Mr. Nowell. It would be the perfect CD if it still had the original Get Out! version because I think that's actually one of the best displays of Brad's heartfelt voice out of all those CDs. But still all-in-all, this CD is well worth the investment."
2,This seems like a copy of a copy,I have an original print from the museum and the colors of this print seemed washed out in comparison. So from now on I'm just going to get museum copies. Truer colors
4,Elle,"Overall the video was great. Though the person operating the camera was not that good because in the beginning there are to many close ups and you have a hard time following along. About ten minutes into the video they seem to find another camera person and you can watch all the moves and follow along as well. Though they say this video is for all stages, I mainly think it is for intermediates."
2,Too Much Sugar,"Although its always nice to find gluten free products available to those who suffer from Celiac Disease, its also troubling to find many of these products also are high in sugar. I found this to be extremely too sweet for my taste. If I purchase something that is chocolate I want to taste chocolate not be overwhelmed by sugar.Rice flour in itself is high glycemic and with the added sugar this product made me feel ill from the sugar content. I have been baking for years the old fashioned way with whole wheat but after developing Celiac I no longer could consume it. I learned later from a nutritionist that sugar was also a problem for people who have Celiac. Through trial and error I found this to be so true. Can't the makers of these mixes back off on the sugar? I removed the chips as well as they were too sweet. Other than that its okay for a rice flour mix cause we all know rice does not compare to whole wheat."
5,Absolutely Delicious!!!,These cookies were so easy to prepare and bake and they were absolutely delicious! I have tried a few other gluten-free cookie mixes but this one was superior.
5,Great Chocolate Chips Cookies,So good that even those who do not need gluten free will also enjoy them.That is the ultimate complement for a gluten free product. Well done Pamela's!I have these on subscription with Amazon. Great deal.
3,Rubber shocks are horrible,The quality itself on the mic is really great. But the rubber shocks are really horrible. Nearly all of the rubbers have snapped and even the extra ones. The few that have not snapped make squeaky sounds and gets picked up by the mic itself. I can no longer use it unless it stays on a with the camera on a tripod and is completely still.The newer version of this seems to have fixed these issues though.
1,damaged product.,"damaged product. not functioning properly. the switch power is misplaced and wrong do not turn off the microphone. capture the two positions are the same, does not change the gain."
1,Did not like the quality of the product,Flimsy construction. I didn't notice any significant improvement in sound quality on the 7D! Too large a size for DLSR use. Returned it.
1,dissappointed,We are trying to video hunting and have had nothing but problems with this microphone setup. the mic will fall off the camera repeatedly. I'v had to hold mine on with a rubberband! the hotshoe connection has broken innumerable times to the point where i am unable to use this mic setup. For the cost i feel we were ripped off. very very disappointed.
1,terrible cust service,"bought the rode videomic for my sony hdr fx1000.direction say you can set a pad switch down 10db or 20 db cannot move switch in either direction,called rode cust service no call backs,they keep e-mailing me a form that you cannot type comment on.third message to call me and still no call back!RODE CORP SUCKS!!!!M Pirelli."
1,damaged,"Item is clearly not new. Scratched and worn body. Foam is matted down and won't return to normal. Ironically, it comes with a hand-checked quality control checklist which the operator clearly just tacked off without looking at the product. Make sure your item is not used. Shame on Rodes and Amazon for allowing this to be sold as ""new"". How come these boxes never arrive sealed? I am returning this item today."
2,a little too noise capture,"I just receive it.I'm a litle desapointed.The sound recorded has a noise when I conect the mic in the T2i camera or in my PC in.It's a sssssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh in the silence, and reduction in sensibility or pass high filter, do not change it.Well, next time let's try before buy!"
1,horrible horrible waste of money,"I bought this mic for at the same time as my Canon T3i and was really pumped about using it for an upcoming video shoot. i got the item and tried it out only to find out it wasnt picking up any audio when recording, and even making the small adjustments possible with audio levels it still didnt work. returned it immediately. JUNK!"
1,Waste,"Waste of money. there is more noise than i anticipated. It's too big and I rather use the mic that comes on my camera. I recorded with a guy who have the same camera as i do and his volume turned out better than mines, and I used the mic. If i were you i would find another mic but buy it and see for yourself first."
5,Very nice,"I'm pretty picky when it comes to electronics. This fits the bill, nicely. I've worked in TV, radio, and pro audio... not bad for the price."
4,Great mic fo a DSLR,"I got this mic to put on my Canon 60D for shooting video. Compared to the small mic on the camera this one is awesome. It picks up a lot of background noise and I would not recommend it for interviews. However, I shot a few events using only this mic (including interviews) and it was not that bad."
5,Great mic for many uses,I have two of these now because they hold up to a lot of use and are easy to use. They always give me great sound quality and the price is right. It's especially good for small cameras.
5,Great Sound,Very clear and crisp quality. Better than the Sony mic that I was going to get for my HD cam. I also use it for voice-over recording. Works well.
2,"Ok, but not great","Bought this item to have a higher quality mic to record live music performances and it hasn't worked out very well. Overall the mic is very easy to use and gets decent sound when recording normal video (ie Weddings, parties, ect)but camera mic worked alright for that too. For what I wanted it for it didn't work. Looks like I'll have to use a regular vocal mic to record live music."
3,It's good for the money.,This product is good if your on a budget. You deff get good sound quality but when plugged into a dslr you will still hear the hiss or hum that you will get on the on-camera mic. To reduce this..plug into an h4n or h1n. The shock mount is a little cheap but it's worked for me so far.
3,Rode VideoMic doesn't fit Canon HFS 100 Vixia camcorder,"Length:: 0:18 MinsThe Rode mic shoe adaptor doesn't fit the Canon HFS 100 HD Vixia camcorder.I had to:1. Remove the mic shoe adaptor completely and discard it2. Make a shoe adaptor using strap iron, one bolt, four washers and three nuts3. Raise the mic higher so the flash can open4. Turn the mic base around to prevent casting flash shadows on the subjectsThis is Rode's response:""Our mic has a standard shoe adaptor, Canon are the ones that should inform the customer that they will need a special adaptor for the camera.""Ron YettService & SupportThe sound quality is fantastic."
2,Damaged product,The mount of the microphone was broken off and never included. I couldn't attach it to my DSLR. I didn't even both to see if the mic worked. I returned it and will try for round two.
3,How could I use it,"This was a recommendation for my Panasonic G2 purchase. An adapter was recommended to make it work. The adapter was the same size as the mic plug. I need a very tiny one, so it has had zero use. please research before you suggest a product."
2,Hot shoe mount is not universal...,"The sound quality of this microphone is a vast improvement from the stock mic in my Sony HDR-CX560, but the hot shoe mount did not fit the groove on my Handycam's hot shoe. I had to literally grind it down and it broke my camera's microphone input. I don't recommend this microphone to Handycam users."
3,There is a new version out - the Videomic Pro,"Don't buy this model. It's the old one. Rode has just released a much improved new one, called ""Videomic Pro"". The new model has a +20dB audio booster that will greatly improve the recording quality on camcorders and DSLRs. Amazon doesn't have a listing for the new model yet. I am hoping they will correct that soon."
2,Not the firepower of a real shotgun microphone,"It does sound better than the regular mic on the camera, but it doesn't have nearly the same kind of quality and crispness that a real shotgun mic would sound like. Also, keep in mind you won't get to hear while you're recording, so it's a total crap shoot when you're making your videos. Until DSLR's start making cameras that allow you to hear while recording, I'd stay away from these and record with an external device. Good quality is something you should never compromise in. No one forgives mediocre audio.."
2,"Crappy ""Squeaky"" Design Ruins the Good Audio","My mic lasted about a month before the rubber bands started squeaking audibly, completely destroying the audio, rendering mine uselss. The rubber bands for the shockmount become brittle quickly and the whole thing starts knocking around. The mic is super sensitive and picks up everything in the room, not unidirectional... could be good or bad depending on what you need.What also sucks about the design is that it's so long that it hangs backwards over the back of your DSLR, hitting you in the eye, getting in the way of your viewfinder.It's just really cumbersome."
4,Happy,"Not what you call industrial strength. its certainly fragile atop my sony hd1000u. but it looks cool, professional. But most importantly it sounds great. I used it for a talking head interview and it worked well as promised. I used it instead of my shure xlr lapel mic. The voice was most dynamic placed 4-6 ft from the subject. It still picked up the computer in thee room. so as usual it got shut off. even though its not an xlr, I would buy again. I do wish for an auto off switch, but I suppose that would pose a risk of shutting off at an inappropriate time."
4,Rodes mic,"I have been searching for a deal on this mic for awhile now and this was the best price ever. Thanks, great mic.."
3,It works but I'm a bit disappointed,I purchased this for the reason that we needed to get good sound in a noisy environment and I did it knowing that the 3 step Pad was difficult to get to and that some had voiced concerns about construction. The mic does work but when the mic is Padded to -10 it adds allot of noise and muffles the audio and at -20 it's even worse. So in reality there is no padding available The shock mount is much more flimsy than expected - especially for the weight of the mic. I expected better from Rode & I am disappointed.
2,Pretty decent audio quality but cheap plastic build,"I ordered this mic about three weeks ago and I used it for one shoot and was happy with the quality. It's much better than the mic on my DSLR. However on my second shoot, the mount for the mic (which is plastic, everything is plastic) snapped when the DSLR camera fell over in my car. So I am very unhappy with the fact that the mount is made out of plastic. I now have to either re-order the broke piece or contact rode. I wouldn't suggest this mic if your on a bit of a professional level."
2,EXTREMELY LOW RECORDING,"This product was supposed to be THE BEST. But it simply quit after a few months. The sound quality when it worked was great. Now when i try to use it you literally have to put your mouth on the mic for it to even pick anything up. I have it set to 0 DB and 20 DB gain on my camera (T2i). Please don't just skip over this review thinking that it is just a lie or something. I had a true problem with this. I also took it to a dealer and they couldn't find out what it was. I was hoping for more...... Just buy a ZOOM, they seem a lot better. Since i spent my money on other things, i now have to save to get a new mic before i can even film again. BIG RIP-OFF"
1,absolutely worthless,"i purchased this mic in hopes to make a relatively high quality recording, what i got was a better recording from a wireless mic from radio shack. If you spend over $10 for this microphone, your getting ripped off"
2,unfortunate purchase,The item I happened to purchase did not work.There may always be a bad luck to buy a defective one.It did scarcely catch any sound for my canon HV30.I tried it with my old JVC DV-3000 but it did not fit into the shoe.The design looks awkward and big although it has had a good reputation but at least not for me. So I returned it. Maybe I should find other brand or item.
3,Not for DSLR,"I wanted a mic for my Canon 60D. I researched a bit and decided to go with this Rode VideoMic.My research however, wasn't as thorough as it should've been. After a few tests, I noticed that the output level was really low. After further more research, I found out that it is well documented (don't know why I didn't read about it before) that DSLRs have low output with this mic and Rode recommends the Pro version which has aa +20db in the mic itself.This mic isn't bad at all. It's just not for DSLRs."
4,great product for the price,I got this camera to get better sound quality while shooting video with my DSLR. 100% successful - head an shoulders about the built in mic. Here is the link to my test:[...]Quality of construction is something that I am not 100% confident about. It seems very plasticy and held by a set of 8 rubber bands in the floating bracket. But it is working fine so far.
4,Great DSLR accessory from Amazon,"My Videomic from Amazon arrived on time as promised. It preforms very well. I recorded a live piano and the video audio certainly now sounds exactly like the piano sounded according to my musician daughter. No background noise or hiss that I could hear. I have two dislikes: 1. When the mike is mounted on my canon 5DM2, I can't look into the viewfinder for an occasional still. It protrudes back too far. This really bugs me. 2. The piano was too loud when the mic was up close, causing the manual setting to be almost zero. Super sensitivity! I needed to change the PAD. This was very difficult for me. Getting in there with a pointed tool and moving a very tiny switch. I guess I am getting to old. Otherwise I think it is great. They have a new mic in the works (videomic HD), which really looks super. I will probably add that one to my arsenal when it is available.Les"
5,Works Well...,"Item is well constructed. Have only used it a few times, but seems to work well. Gives the camera a more professional look, which may or may not help, depending on what you're filming."
4,Decent quality audio.,"Not too much to say other than, the quality is decent but not great. There is always that subtle hiss in the background that you cant get rid of. It isn't terrible though. Great price for a decent product."
3,Not quite as enjoyable as their first book.,"Their first book, describing the Schreider's trip from Alaska to Argentina, was a fun read. However, I have found this book less engaging. The attempt in the narrative to engross the reader within the experience by using local language references backfires, tripping up the reader, or at least tripping up me. I have really wanted to enjoy this; instead, I'm having to work at it."
3,Good - but not that good,The approach taken is purely visual and lacks the impact of the TV documentaries shown in the UK. In the end I was left with a feeling of an incomplete telling. The music detracts from the action by competing for attention. A lot of time the heavy breathing of the pilots and the laconic commands are a lot more dramatic than the music. I wonder if that was done to avoid the need for translation for other markets?
1,Bush Adminstration Betrayal of America,"I guess now Timmerman is going to have to write a sequel: The Spanish Betrayal of America. Those uppity European countries just won't do what the Bush admistration tell them. Outrageous!!!The reality is that if the United States had listened to France and given the U.N. inspectors more time, they would have been able to establish the same thing that we have belatedly discoverd: that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction. Without this pretext the Bush administration would not have been able to conn the American people into supporting this War. Therefore we would not be stuck in this quagmire with our troops being killed and injured.The French were right all along. It is the Bush adminstration that betrayed America by luring us into the stupid, counterproductive war."
1,another piece of propaganda,"Did Chirac or Villepin lie to Bush?Did Saddam and Chirac have a close relationship?If you waste your time reading this book, you will havethe pleasure of knowing the fabricated answers.Did Bush, Powell, Rice lie about WDM?Did Bush lie about the link between Al qeada and Iraq?Did Bush decide that torture was needed to extract useless information from innocents when the US pretends to be in high moral grounds?Spend you money on Woodward, Clark and wilson books...An advise from another french traitor :-)"
1,An Incredible Work of Fiction!!,"This book is truly a magnificent work of fiction -- the author has a tremendous imagination!! The novel is almost as compelling and almost as credible as Bush's claims of caches of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq! If we, the American people, were sold out by anyone, it was by the Bush administration."
1,this is soooo sad,Here is yet another example of rapid fire accusation and brain-dead nationalism that have deprived most American conservatives of the ability to think sensibly about international affairs. Cheap opportunism in action.
1,"Yeah, It's All The French's Fault","That's what should be the tile of this latest Rightwing tract. Oh well, I shouldn't be concerned. Everyone knows wingnuts can't read. Hey Kenneth! Thank God for those bulk sales to ""conservative"" Book Clubs, eh??"
5,A great assesment,"Here we are shown the truth about why France refused to support the invasion of Iraq and actively campaigned to thwart America. Contrary to belief it had nothing to do with human rights or Altruistic motives. Instead this wonderful text sheds light on the hundreds of millions of dollars in business the French did with Saddam including the massive debts Iraq had to France that they knew America would never repay once we won. This book sheds light on Chiracs secret relationship and support of Saddam, something that goes back more then a decade. A very eye opening book that looks deep inside the American-French political relationship in the later part of the 20th century and the early 21st century. A great current events read and a must read for anyone seeking to understand the 2nd Iraq War.Seth J. Frantzman"
1,One-sided view of history.,"I find it difficult to believe that Mr. Timmerman is a paid journalist as I found this book to be a one sided view of history. While he notes that the French traded and had diplomatic relations with Iraq, he fails to examine America's relations with Saddam during the 1980s. In fact, during the Reagan administration, the US supported Iraq with weapons and turned a blind eye when Saddam was killing his people.With this in mind, I would theorize the Mr. Timmerman wrote this book merely to make a buck from current conservative America's hostile feelings over France. Freedom fries anyone?"
1,Great Reading If You Are A Liberal,"The title itself is a portrait of linguistic misdirection. I bought this book with the idea that it would be a totally objective look into the conspiracy theories about who is charge of the world as in a Jim Marrs book.I soon realized that what I was reading was a myopic and loquacious diatribe railing against conservatives. There was very little mention of any liberal or Democratic malfeasance whatsoever.The title should be changed from the current innocuous one to ""Americans Should Know That Bush / Conservative Republicans / Religious Right / Industrial Military Complex / Right Wing Neocons / Oil Tycoons Are Running The Word"".Anyone who loves reading articles from Maureen Dowd and Paul Krugmen would love this book.For those who know that conspiracies and corruption haven't any political affiliation I wouldn't recommend this book."
3,good for random reading,"I like to have it around the house for the short breaks that I have in my busy day. There are a lot of interesting points in the book. definitely makes one wonder what is really going on in our world and who is behind it. Warning: this book can upset some people. If you are a Bush follower, you might not want to read this! I hate Bush so I found it rather interesting."
3,Should be titled - Political Economy for dummies,"I like the idea behind this book, but it's just too light on the facts.If you read the paper or blogs or listen to Air America, you know most of the stuff in here. It reads more like the summary of a hundred political thrillers than a factual book that could help you to a deeper understanding of how the elite manipulate politics and the economy.The author gets an A for effort, but a C- on execution. A fine introduction for people who don't know much about who's running things but would like to know more. For those who are aware of these kinds of things already save your money, or buy it for your relative who watches Fox news and thinks their learning something."
3,"""the have and the have mores..""","While Melissa Rossi does an excellent job of introducing several intriguing arguments about the nations ruling class, the book seems a bit shallow. Are we really surprised to find that elected officials are corrupt? It was if Ms. Rossi had an axe to grind. As a right leaning Democrat, I was secretly pleased that in her eyes the Democratic Party seemed so pristine; however, I'm no fool. I hardly think the Democrats have grasped the moral high ground; which is why I'm surprised that there is very little dirt on the Democrats in this book. Although What Every American... lacks depth, it was a worthy purchase. This probably won't be the best book you've ever read but it is intriguing."
5,Eye Opening,This is a good insight into the parasite fear-mongers who rule us and steal from us. A good beginning to expose and dethrone them. Read it cover to cover tonight at a bookstore. Probably will get it for 'notes'.
1,Unhappy,"This is the first review I have ever written. I decided to write the review, because this is the first book I have ever purchased that I cannot finish. If you took the facts from the book, you could only fill up a pamphlet at best. If you want to read one big editorial about the author's political views, then this book is for you. The author would like you to believe that everyone in the book is pure evil. Maybe the book got better after page 125, but I will never know. Terrible"
4,Biased,"I purchased this book and the first thing I noticed was how conspicuously absent it is of anything pertaining to the radical left. The first chapter, in fact, is a dead give away. I admit, right now the conservatives and the ""neo-cons"" are in power but there is nothing said about the counter-culture revolution and all it has spawned (radical eco movement, radical feminist movement, gay rights movement, pro abortion movement, multi cultural movement) and how all this affects not only America but everywhere America extends it reach. Political correctness, unfortunately, is a force to be reckoned with in today's society.That said, I did find a lot of the information useful and did enjoy reading most of the book albeit it was one-sided. If the author is going to attack one side she needs to approach from the common sense center and give both ends of the spectrum their due treatment."
5,Doc and Bill pickin' a few licks!,"Great album. Traditional fiddle tunes/hoedowns and early bluegrass tunes (most of them written by Monroe) played in an intimate relaxed setting. Some of Monroe's best Mandolin picking. Doc is exceptional as always.Great album for musicians. With only two instruments playing, you can really hear what they're doing. Singing combination is very interesting as well: Bill's famous high tenor and Doc's deep, melodious voice.This is a great album by two masters of traditional music."
5,Like a hoe-down on Heaven's back porch ...,"Monroe and Watson are, of course, masters of their considerably crowded domain, and this recording shows why. Just a couple of amazing musicians having some fun together -- relaxed and loose but with plenty of sparks a-flyin'. The fingers are picking fast and furious. The vocals are superb, and some of the instrumental runs are simply breathtaking. Recording quality is more than acceptable.The whole thing plays like a jam session at the country barbecue of your dreams. But it today and watch it get stuck in your CD player for days on end."
1,leaves gunk in the brine tank,"I clcked one star because it won't accept zero. We bought this salt brand from Ace Hardware. After the first use our brine tank had a disgusting layer of gunk on top of the water. I called Hague (who soldus our softener) to ask if I used the wrong kind of salt, and they said it shouldn't matter. But they were wrong. We cleaned out the tank and started over (this is the only brand of potassium salt that Ace carries right now) and it happened again. I found a Water Softener Q/A site that says crystal salt is the lowest quality and contains the most impurities. We will not use this salt ever again. Previously we used pellet-style potassium salts and had no problems."
1,Be careful,"Read very carefully, you are purchasing only one bag not four. The way they write this up it sounds like you are receiving four not one bag. Shipping was out of sight and made you believe you would be receiving four bags instead of one. I will not purchase anything from this company again. So I tell you be careful of this company and how they sell their products."
1,nature's own potassium crystals,"Ace switched over to this brand over a year ago from another brand that worked great. Since then we have had all types of problems with our water softner system. We finally figured out after virtually replacing every part in the tanks and water softner tub that these crystals were the problem. They not only contain many impurities but they tend to ""cake"" over and clog up the area where the water is filtrated in the tub. THis then prevents the water from filling or sometimes results in overfilling the tub. In order to use these tablets we can't have more than one bag in the tub at any time and generally end up scooping it out in order to get the granuals that have ""caked up"" out of the tub. Unfortunately it took a year to trace the root cause back to these crystals."
4,heavy head,"My son begged for this for halloween, then wouldn't wear it because the head was too heavy. If it doesn't sit just right it falls forward/backward. I wouldn't recommened for a toddler."
2,suffragette diary,"The book is okay,but near the end Dollie is force fed (tube in the nose). The book is pretty informative about what suffragettes did. There is a good deal of protesting and breaking things. Unfortunately, there is quite a description of Dollie and other marchers being assaulted, both verbally and physically (and raped), by policemen. While it may be historically accurate, I do not consider this content appropriate for kids."
2,A Certain Miss,"Good concept to discuss different types of leadership with good and bad examples. However, most of the work seems to be on the positive examples with the anti-types being included as an afterthought. Nearly all chapters are weak developments of leadership style with the notable exception being the one on Harriet Tubman. Additionally, both the types of leadership styles discussed and the people chosen to represent them appear to fit the author's preferences rather than true representations of leadership styles and leaders. This book was an easy read and parts were even enjoyable but the content was not as substantive as I had hoped.The best recommendation that I can make is to check this one out of a library instead of purchasing it.(review written by a life-long student of leadership with a library full of leadership texts.)"
2,Not very good book,"Leadership is an interesting topic, but Wills somehow manages to drain all the life out of it. I did learn a little, though, so that's why I gave it two stars instead of one.I also thought that the author let his political bias get in the way of his writing.Not a book that was worth reading."
1,"Garbage, worst on the subject","This book is a mess. The thesis presented in the introduction is a rambling essay on the importance of followers and historical forces in leadership, which might leave the reader less informed about leadership than before he/she read it. What's worse is that the intro has nothing at all to do with the rest of the book (which is marginal in it's own right). The case studies are way too short and are made even less informative by Wills habit of not even mentioning the leader until five or six pages of nonsense. My overall feeling of this book is that it was poorly researched and badly written. I wonder (in all seriousness) whether Wills knows anything at all about some of the people he writes about. Skip this one. I suggest Lincoln on Leadership instead: it provides the rudiments of leadership with clear, well researched examples."
3,Blah,This item was required reading for Master of Organizational Management program. Found the info to be moderately helpful and easy to apply.
4,Leadership Handbook,"I purchased this book for an online class. The book provides a general overview of several leadership styles. The author covers a broad spectrum of leaders from Socrates to Martin Luther King, Jr. I am not an avid reader, however I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in historical leadership styles."
4,Kudos for Certain Trumpets,"Certain Trumpets is a great resource for individuals who want to take a fresh look at leadership types. As an introvert I've been puzzled for many years, wondering what kind of magic I exude that makes people want to follow me. Garry Wills affirms that there are many types of leaders, and likens them to historical figures."
1,abysmal,"Probably the worst thing about it is that THIS ALPHA PRINT IS MISSING THE 2nd REEL (most Slaughter films are around 70 minutes--this one is 53. The story jumps from a drunken Mary leaving the pub directly to people talking about her murder. The Tod Slaughter movies are usually delightful, full of good old-fashioned melodrama; the actors--especially the wonderful Slaughter--obviously relish their hamming it up. And the sets are usually interesting, and surprisingly well produced. BUT NOT IN THIS ONE. This one has perfunctory acting, dark lighting in dreary sets you can barely make out. It's all talk (and boring talk at that) and no action. If you are a Tod Slaughter completist, you may want to hunt down this flick manufactured by a different company."
1,don't waste your time.,"I am a big fan of Ms. O'Day-Flannery but this was one of her worst books. The concept of casting a ""spell"" to conjure up Mr. Perfect is a dream I'm sure many of us would like to believe in. Suzanne, the main character, is so negative and untrusting I just wanted to strangle her at the end. Ian claims she is warm and giving and that is why he loves her but I didn't see any proof or action on her part to make me believe it. I love time travel and more ""steam"". If this is your first Constance O'Day book please read her other books which are the best: Timeless Passion, Time After Time and Once And Forever"
1,HORRIBLE,"this book is so bad I cant even finish it. Its so bad I am compelled to write my first review ever. I knew it was bad when the protagonist was hot for LETTERMAN in the first chapter. But i kept slogging through the drivel hoping for a little action. after countless pages of self pity & depression...DEPRESSION! Lets just say there was baffling pity nookie. not even nookie, i dont know what that was. this book is going in the trash, i cant inflict it on anyone else."
2,Mixed Feelings..,"First of all, I liked the premise of the book. The conjuring up of a perfect man who happend to be from another century could have been more entertaining than it was. It was hard to keep interest in the story because there was too much thrown in the mix. For example, the character Rahmin served reading their astrological charts was unnecessary and did not add to the mystery of reincarnation.The second problem I had was that Suzanne could be such an irritating, unlikeable character. Towards the end I wanted to strangle her. The romance in the book was poorly written and the character of Ian seemed to disappear for awhile towards the end.Like another poster, I would like to re-write the book."
4,Raw Deal,"Hey - I am reading the reviews here of a book that I adore and the reviews are unkind and I think, unfair. This book is pure fantasy. For readers who are reading a book about time travel to say that casting a spell to make your perfect man is silly,.....well - that is just silly. If you are reading and willing to escape...then jump in and escape. Truth be told - I read this book long before I ever met my husband and as a twenty something - I made a little spice ""mix"" of my own. This book is magic and whimsy and tons of fun. Read and enjoy......"
2,Bewitched,"I have read many of Constance O'Day Flannery's books and was disappointed with this one. The basic concept was good and I would have enjoyed it if the author had refrained from using the word ""giggle"". By the time I was done with the first chapter I was counting the number of times the word giggle, giggled & giggles was used. Not to mention numerous ""chuckles, howled with laughter & stifled smiles. The only one not smiling, giggling or laughing is the reader."
3,Would have been better if it was more complete.,"I had to special order this book also. It's an entertaining book, but doesn't really give me any new info. In fact, Mickey completely omits mention of his second wife, although he does mention his three girls. How are we supposed to think he got them? After having read Davy's autobio, it seems a lot of info is omitted here. The most annoying thing is that Micky writes this in sort of a pseudo-British banter that I find phony and put-on. I know the guy spent a lot of time there, but sheesh! If you can get this for less than $10, go for it. If not, check out the library instead."
2,Superficial to the max!,"Mickey Dolenz must have been pressed for time in churning out this quickie. It is the most superficial of books. An inordinate amount of time is spent on descibing his child star career, I felt. Then the years with the Monkees, making records, etc. are just sort of - well, it's all there, but in a very superficial way. ""I did this, we did that, boy we had some good times, then we did this, boy I had a bad time"". Near the end he mentions he gets married again and has 3 daughters, and we never even learn the wife's name!!! For Monkee Fans only."
4,Filled With Fun and Info,"As a Monkees' fan from way back in the hey-day, my nostalgia has been getting the better of me lately. And that is why I purchased Micky Dolenz' ""I'm A Believer."" This is the kind of book about the Monkees, their show and their recordings that I wanted to read. Micky writes a fast-paced, information-filled journal that doesn't stint on fun. Micky's sense of humor is present throughout as are fascinating facts about the whole Monkees era. Micky has happily chosen not to dish nasty dirt, and that is a welcome relief these days. I found the book to be a good read and highly recommend it to any Monkees' fan."
5,I read this book in two days,"I just couldn't put it down. Though I already knew alot about the Monkees, I didn't know much about Micky before and after. This book is very funny because Micky is a very funny person. It's good to see what he thought about the Monkees and to see everything written from his view. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody who cares anything about the Monkees or Micky, if you can still find it."
3,"fun, easy read","This is a fun, easy to read memoir with humor and anecdotes. I loved the Monkees as a child and saw two of the reunion concerts, but without Micky there. The music is still great, timeless and this was a pleasant, albeit small insight into the band."
5,Groovy! A great book!,"I read this book twice, checking it out of the library both times. I love it (mainly cuz Micky wrote it, I just LOVE him)! I've seen all the Monkees shows, and they are SO funny! Micky is my favorite (doncha just love his 'fro), and that's why I read the book. I've also heard most of the Monkees songs."
3,"Lighthearted fluff, just like the show","Dolenz, whose distinctive voice dominated the airwaves during the Summer of Love, writes an entertaining but slight account of his days with the Monkees and beyond. He is frank about his womanizing and drug use without being overtly scandalous; when you stop to think about the names he COULD name, and the lurid stories he COULD tell ...The best of the Monkee autobiographies, so far."
5,Not for literal minded or those who do not LOVE playing,My son was looking for a book as a baby present and this is the first one that came to mind for him. Sadly you can only get it used now.He and his brother loved this book and it is one his father and I still refer to with smiles on our face. After this book we were often requested to make a story silly even if it wasn't. Eggs jump out of the frying pan when it gets too hot; a car gets put in Elp's tail when it is too big and heavy to carry; multiple tales of fun and silly weave together into one delightful story.I highly recommend this book.
1,What???????!!!!!!,"Okay, yes, we laughed - but not in the way the author might have intended. Honestly, this was a very weird book. If you still think it's good, you may need serious Hey-Elp! (literary reference to this story) That said, we appreciated the low price of one cent on Amazon. Thanks for the good deal!"
5,"Practical, step-by-step guide","This book is one of the rare guides which is organize not by what the author knows but what are the typical problems you (the reader) have to solve. I would call it ""How to.."" book. Almost every time when I need to mount the disk, add the device I found exact instructions how to do it and it worked.I am not very experienced Linux user (< 2 years) and I found this book just right for me."
5,The Southern Brothers,Track Listings:1. Don't You Dare Get A Blessing2. Undiscovered Country3. Almighty King4. Servant Of The Lord5. Mountain Railroad6. Come Out Of The Wilderness7. Pictures Of Heaven8. Heart Bigger9. I Bowed On My Knees10. Victoryside
3,to much detail,"The framework suggested my the book is useful however the interviewee shouldn't solve the case in a very structured way. That may be disliked by the interviewer. Some cases were good but some cases required prior knowledge of the issue. Good book, not the best. You should better read others as well."
5,Great Prep for a Consulting Interview,"If you are going to interview for one of the big consulting firms (McKinsey, Bain, Boston Consulting, Booz Allen), you should prepare yourself with this book. To really feel confident in an interview, you'll probably want 3-4 weeks of prep time with this book. So, if you anticipate getting an interview with one of the big consulting firms, pick this up and start reading. It worked for me."
5,It is an awesome CD.,"This is a great CD. I just love the last song on the CD, ""Some Dreams"". It is a little different from their other songs, but it is one of my favorites. I would recommend this CD to everyonre!"
3,"pretty good, not as good as their more recent songs.","this nsync single comes off their S/T album released over seas. the title track ""Together Again"" is a nice ballad, but not as good as ""For the girl who has everything"" or ""God must have spent a little more time on you."" maybe the length of the title has something to do with it. i still like the song though. However, i especially like the last track on the single, ""Some Dreams."" it really doesn't live up to the present song quality, but i like it just as much as their more recent songs.i wish they would perform it on a tv special or wherever i can view it.JOEY"
1,My Ears Hurt,"After listening to this song I find it repulsive and low class for the ability we all know nsync can do. This recording made me want to scream out loud just so I could stop listening to this terrifying screeches that you call music. It made my ears want to bleed. I had a headache for a week. I do not recommend this if your prone to have really bad migranes from Lou Bega's music, because this is 100 times worse. My little sister even begged my to turn off, what she calls, the monster coming from the computer screen. I'm writing for the true fans of nsync, and saying that this should be a truely embarrasing time for our fav five. thankyou."
5,Astounding....,"I've just purchased this set, and I'm still listening to it now as I write this, but I'm knocked out. I thought at one stage I was listening to the Band, there's so many wonderful tracks here. The packaging is superb, the content will blow you away. Listen to this, then the Broadside set, and revel in some of the most powerful music ever committed to the public ear."
5,Harry Smith Anthology,"I received this unbelieveable collection of original folk music (bluegrass/folk/country/blues) today, have listened to each recording and am in awe of the insite and charisma involved in this labor of love and dedication. If you are the least bit interested in our country's history and/or roots this collection will just wet your appetite for more information and sounds. The enclosed booklet and copy of ""American Folk Music"" compilation is in itself a treasure trove of data. I will be ever greatful to my gift giver and to Harry Smith. I LOVE IT!!!!"
2,Better than some . . .,"Dale Brown can write, but his style is self-serving (he interjects politics into his work relentlessly). I do not know why he does this, as he is bound to reduce his readership over time as he alienates potential fans. His efforts to control the reader's mind in this regard are offensive, but in all fairness, some of his previous works have been much worse. Mr. Brown is very good with the technical stuff, and in this case, I thought his story was creative and original. But it's convoluted and implausible, too, which must be why Clive Cussler admires it so. Mr. Brown has done worse, but he's done somewhat better, too. Overall, this is a fast read and the book does deliver suspense by the bushel."
4,The Dragon Awakes?,"I just happened to read this earlier this year (2011), and then was stunned when I saw the news about China refitting an old Soviet aircraft carrier!!! While stealth capabilities may be beyond the structural build of the B52, launching cruise missiles is not (it's already been done).As for the political end of the story. China and Taiwan have no love lost between them, and the current military obligations of U.S. forces spread resources a bit thin around the rest of the globe. When Dale Brown wrote this book it was fiction and fantasy. Now you might just loose a little sleep wondering if some Chinese general doesn't have a grand plan for that new aircraft carrier and for reunification with Taiwan.How things change in a decade......."
3,A Mediocre Yarn,"No, Dale Brown is not another Tom Clancy. However, this particular book does a credible job spinning a story around a resurrected B-52 fleet. Joseph Campanella's voice characterizations are quite good and easily recognizable allowing the listener to keep the many characters straight while concentrating on the story line. The audio is crisp and clean making for easy listening in a high noise environment. I especially enjoyed Brown's geographical description of Taiwan, and warfare between China and Taiwan. However, landing a modified B-52 in Taiwan where they did...naw. Anyway, 6 hours."
2,Stronger than a Bear & Twice as Smart,"If you want a techno-thriller where planes and weapons fly about like a war game, this is your book. Dale Brown's books have been compared to Tom Clancy's, who got his inspiration from a naval game. This reminds me of saying someone is strong as a bear and twice as smart. If you want literature where important struggles are in the hearts, minds and souls of the characters, forget it. I'd be cautious if it were twice as good as Tom Clancy's."
2,Hard to say,"The scenario is possible, but isn't totaly realistic. An EB-52 can be made, but that would result in massive overhauling of the regular B-52. Also, I don't know how it is possible that for a little dinky company of John masters to build a multi-million dollar warplane without other people having knowledge it. How did he get the funds? Finally, a pregnant woman on a bomber destroying a bunch of nuclear is just way out of the world...Dale Brown has good ideas to write about, but this book was borderline propaganda/imagination for the B-52."
1,Technical manual with sporadic weak story line,"I used to enjoy Dale Brown but I didn't enjoy this one at all. I found myself skipping large sections of boring technical specifications of virtually everything. (No I do not like romance novels). I entertained the possiblity that I was just getting lazy but after reading most of the reviews here I find I remain with the majority. I'll read the reviews first next time. I have an idea for Dale... we can all go out and buy Jane's book of ships, missles, planes, and jock-straps and he can simply provide page references. This should cut the book size in half."
3,So-so story,This was an entertaining but often frustrating book. The rebellious old pilot got on my nerves. There were many unresolved questions (my #1 -- why did the Chinese admiral surrender to Western forces to save the aircraft crew --- this is the same guy who ordered nuclear strikes against unprepared Taiwanese!). I'd recommend passing on this one -- there are too many good books out there...
2,One of Dale Brown's Worst...,"I have been a huge fan of Dale Brown's and have read almost all of his novels. He helped satisfy my craving for Clancy novels when their introductions slowed. But Fatal Terrain is by far his worst effort to date and definitely not worth reading by those that are trying to decide. I agree with another reader, his constant referrals to his other books get very tiring. In addition, I love the technical nature of these types of books, but he goes way overboard. I found myself skipping sentences because he appeared to be filling space. There have to be better alternatives out there."
1,A complete waste of time.,"'Fatal Terrain' is poorly written, poorly edited, and poorly plotted. The characters are wooden. And the author exhibits practically no feel for the plain meanings of the English language: for example, in one passage, character 1 states that character 2 is OBLIGED to do so-and-so, and MAY do so-and-so, but that character 2 has no OBLIGATION to do either. This is a contradiction, and should certainly have been caught by an alert editor. 'Fatal Terrain' is simply not even a good beach read, and is about 20 cuts below 'Flight of the Old Dog'. I hope that it is the last Dale Brown I pick up -- life is too short to read books as poorly written as this."
1,"It's not the money I regret wasting, but the time!","One stinker-oo of a book! Where to begin? Dialogue that cracks like cellophane - hollow and stiff? A plot that meanders around in circles? Characters that are built up and then disappear without a word?Wow, I'll certainly not read another from this writer!"
1,Clancy - lite,"This book is my second and last I will read in the ""Old Dog"" series. The problem with the book is not that he doesn't understand his subject, he just cheats too often. I don't want to give much of the plot away to someone who might read it, but the characters are two dimensional, the plot is too predictable and there is way too much deus ex machina. He has tried to be politically correct by including females in his combat crews, but he makes sure that only minor male characters are at any risk. This was one book that while I was reading, I was hoping it would get better---it didn't. If you are a hard core military/tech fan, you will enjoy it, but it is standard fare with no significant surprises or insights."
2,It is just fiction,"I read the entire book. You can enjoy the story only if you remind yourself that it is just fiction. Don't let the author's lack of knowledge about: a) politics; b) foreign affairs; c) the legal system; d) business or a host of other areas interfere with your reading. The characters are cartoon characters- no depth. The plot is predictable (the good guys win). That being said, Brown tells a good tale. I did finish it. It was entertaining if not great literature."
2,Pure Fantasy,"Two retired US Generals, the President of the US, the entire Chinese Communist leadership, and dozens if not hundreds of career military officers go bonkers, break discipline, disobey orders and international law to start a nuclear war over minor perturbations in a 50 year old standoff."
5,Fatal Terrain is a great military read.,"Dale Brown's Fatal Terrain is one of the best military novels of our generation. I have read several of his novels, and thought this was the best by far. He really goes to lengths to make sure you understand what's going on and this makes for a great read for anybody, knowledgeable of the military or not."
2,Read it if you can shut down your thought processes,"To start with, this book is not a thriller. It's science fiction, pure and simple. You have to be able to shut down your thought processes to enjoy it. On a sensual level, it works. But anyone who has read and enjoyed the earlier works of Robert Ludlem and his mastery of being able to mix the truth with fiction will have trouble with this book. I found it to be the literary equivalent of a World Wrestling Federation match. Lots of noise and glitter but nothing of substance.It's too bad. I would have thought that Brown's style would have improved over the years. His science is usually pretty good but the geo-politics and characterizations are cartoon-like. Take some writing courses, Mr. Brown"
1,Simply Dreadful,"The first and last Dale Brown novel I will ever struggle through. The characters and dialog are idiotic; the story line is inane and unevenly developed (especially as you get closer to the ending); and the technical details are only mildly interesting. I am convinced that Brown himself was heartily sick of it by the time he got to the ending.If you're a fan of the genre and not Dale Brown skip right on by this stinker. I can only hope that Brown's early efforts were better than this one, but I will not spend any more money to find out."
5,Not Bad. Not bad at all,"Fatal Terrain is Dale Brown's much-anticipated 10th novel, and it was a pretty darn good read. The theme of a Chinese attitude of aggression towards its neighbors seems realistic in light of the Chinese display of force a couple years ago near Taiwan. In the book China decides to attack Taiwan using ""all"" the weapons in its inventory. By the last 1/3 of the book, Chinese nukes were flying quite freely all over the Far East, and I really liked the notion of the ""lone wolf"" EB-52 Megafortress standing alone (well, almost alone) against the largest standing army in the world, even if it was a little bit unrealistic. A good read, the pages just flew by. READ IT!"
2,The Poorest Dale Brown Yet,"I hope that this is not the first Dale Brown book someone reads - it will probably be their last. The pace is uneven and erratic. The worst aspect of the book is the total lack of realism conveyed by the ""Brad Elliot"" character. Hopefully, for all our sakes, the US military (and it's semi-autonomous agencies) would have some qualms about letting this man anywhere near a weapon system of this import."
2,Another book with TIGER HEAD but Snake tail!!!,"Like always, the excitement of Brown's books only existed in the 2/3 part of them, and this one is no exception. It seems that the author got a integrity problem in finishing his stories, the ends always proved to be hasty, meaningless, even soul-less. Like ""FLIGHT OF THE OLD DOG"", this time, that refurbished B52 with its die-hard crew still could only carry out certain total senseless and meaningless wargame but had to leave all the answers again to the politicians with big ??? mark that not only jeopardized the integrity of the story but also left the readers helplessly as the author himself. Brown could only provide a scenario and warzone letting the OLD DOG to carry out some good-for-nothing and senseless air strikes missions. Quite Thundering but no rain at all!"
2,Detailed background and plot setup is ruined by bad editting,"I really like Dale Brown books. As ex-military, I enjoy many of the potential scenarios that he describes. However, this is my last Dale Brown book. The first three-quarters of the book is classic Brown: detailed, exciting, with a complex plot. However, the ending of the book is rushed. Problems are solved magically. Few details are provided, some of the carefully developed sub-plots are just dismissed, without explanation. My initial reaction is that these items have fallen victim to poor editting, while technical errors are left in. (The grenade launcher attached to an M-16 is the M-203 not M-206). It just seems such a shame that the climax of the book is contained in 1 chapter, with many unresolved questions hanging out: What happened to Balboa, Finegold, What was in the message to Sampson, How was it planned, final disposition of Guam, etc"
2,No Chinese speaking like what Brown written,"You could make the OLD DOG fly anywhere you like to carry out any kind of fictitious mission you like, but you cannot and should not ridicule the people you really didn't know. The Chinese people never speak like what Brown written in this book. When I read it, it only made me so sad that a good writer could be so ridiculously describe a 1.25 billion people to speak like the funny characters in a Beijing Opera. Just don't put any of your warzones or theatres in the Far East you really don't and can't fully understand, in case it only blows up in your face right away, OK? Fighting the enemy you don't know is a very dangerous move, sen~or"

5,my favorite,"this is my favorite of the Asch Recordings, I just wish it also included the more ""radical"" version of This Land is Your Land.. the one with lyrics about people in bread lines"
4,would recommend,Gave this item for a birthday gift and he really like playing with it.Would recommend it.
5,Like the speaker feature,"My girls (6 and 7) love to play with these games, especially because they can plug their MP3 players into them and use them as external speakers. The characters do funny things that make them laugh. Keeps their interest for about an hour."
3,Holux GPSlim236 USB Cable,"Note, that in the standard packaging, the supplied USB cable is for charging only, not data communications. The manual states that the optional GR230-A2 is required for USB communications with laptops that don't have bluetooth.now, where can I get the stupid cable.... ;("
4,Read this before you go,Lots of terrific info for near to home travelers. I gave it as a gift & the receiver (30's male)was thrilled.
5,great book for music major,this book is must if you're a music major. i had the part 1 of the hamonic materials in tonal music and helped alot in my classes. make sure you do the excerices because they do help in the assignment part of the chapters.
3,Helpful in writing your own essays,"I bought this book to give me inspiration in writing law school application essays, as suggested in The Ivey Guide to Law School Admissions. It did help get my creative juices flowing. The only critique I have is that I wish there were more stories about ""normal"" people - it's easy to write a great essay if something extremely unique and awe-inspiring happened to you. But what about the real, everyday, ubiquitous moments that make up the rest of our lives?"
2,right words,she just goes on and on. i couldn't finish it. the book just kept saying the same thing over and over. just take it out of the library if you need to read this.
5,The Glorious Lonnie Johnson,"Although some hardcore Blues fans may complain about songs like ""Old Rocking Chair"" and ""My Mother's Eyes"" being on this album, the fact is that Lonnie Johnson sounded phenomenal when he crooned. This just isn't the Lonnie album for the guitar nerd; that's all. The interview at the end of the disc about his entire family being musicians is fascinating. Also, despite people often listing his birth year as 1899, he was really born in 1889, according to more modern scholarship."
1,"His ""Folkway Years"" was not what makes Lonnie Johnson acclaimed.","His early recordings, that were recorded around the 1930s or 1940s, or something like that, are the recordings that defined Lonnie Johnson. His guitar playing is great on those early recordings. ""Tommorow Night"" is a good jazz song that I still here played occationally today. But by the time he recorded this Folkway album, he was a older man. All of these songs sound kind of the same, and they are all boring background music sounding. His guitar playing is predictable and calm, which is the complete opposite of what I feel about his early work.Overall, this is the wrong album to buy if you are interested in Lonnie Johnson or the blues."
5,Top shelf true crime writing.,"This is a book that should be on every true crime maven's must-read list.Following the brutal murder of a young American college student studying abroad in South Korea the authorities are confronted with a perplexing mystery. Was the young girl murdered by an American GI she met that evening in a Seoul nightclub frequented by off duty GIs or was she killed by a Korean intruder in her sleazy Seoul motel? Contrasting the radically different investigative skills of the Korean police and the US Army MP investigators, the author follows the investigation as it runs its lengthy course. Following the arrest of a most unlikely suspect the Korean authorities try the defendant according to Korean legal procedures which are shockingly different then ours. The trial and its ambiguous aftermath lead the reader puzzled as to whodunit.Kudos to Ms. Ryan for producing a real page turner!"
3,Murder in Room 103,"I must confess that I had a lot of trouble reading this book. It's not the author's fault, but rather because we (the readers) never find out what really happened to Jamie Penich, a 21 year old college exchange student who was murdered in South Korea. Another student, Kenzi Snider, initially admitted to the crime, but recanted later. Did she murder Jamie? Well, we don't know and we'll never know. So right off the bat, I wasn't invested in the book. I enjoy a true crime book where everything is neatly wrapped up, we know who the killer is (hopefully not a serial killer because i don't like those kinds of books either) and justice has been done."
2,Strange little gadget...,"It arrived timely and we have not the foggiest idea what to do with it...did we order this product under the haze of too many Makers Mark juleps on a balmy, Big Greasy afternoon? Who knows...but if we ever figure it out, ""y'all"" will be the first to know."
5,Ground Zero for Folk and the Nashville Sound,"This is the ""real"" folk music of America. It is simple, honest and speaks to the heart. It isn't remaster, amplified or mixed but made by people singing and playing at home, at church and at play. The songs are about life, love, work, war, good times and bad times.You can hear the sound that trained the Carters, Jimmie Rogers and every ""American folk song and singer"" from Guthrie, Ives and the Weavers on. These songs are done by people singing from the enjoyment of life not for money!Listen for ""Amazing Grace"" from the Old Baptist Church and ""Ruby"" by Grigsby & Young or sit with the Sams. Close your eyes and it could be any date from the 1880s on.If you like folk, blue grass, the old SUN Records sound or are just ""interested"" this is ground zero where it all started."
5,broken in right out the box,"These shoes are light, extremely comfy right out the box, and made with good italian quality. They do look a little long, and I measured them next to a pair of same size sneakers and they stick out about an inch longer, yet it's an extra inch of style in an oval squared tip that leaves room for your foot to breathe and gives that broken in comfort feel. These Shoes are great to wear with a suit, or a pair of jeans, an all around great buy."
2,too many mistakes,"I wouldn't re-make 90% of the meals I've made from these recipes, and I've tried a bunch of them. My family isn't picky, so they eat it, but none of us love the food. It is convenient to be able to make two extra meals to freeze when making dinner, but it isn't worth it when we aren't looking forward to pulling them out of the freezer. Also, I was surprised to see just how many mistakes there were in the recipes. It's a nice idea, but it's just not worth the money. I'll be trying another freezer cookbook."
1,Nightmare Dinners,"Do not purchase this cookbook. It should be titled Nightmare Dinners, not Dream Dinners. Made two recipes with it and noticed that both dinners came out wrong due to errors in the recipes. After the second dinner turned out wrong I checked the reviews on Amazon and discovered that this cookbook has infact been printed with 45 pages of errors, rendering the recipes useless. Please don't waste your time, money, and ingredients on this book. It was poorly edited and your dinners will be inedible."
2,Just a cookbook,"I thought this was supposed to be a book to help me pull together meals that can easily be frozen. All this was was a cookbook. Well I can figure out how to make food and freeze it, that's not what I was expecting. To prepare meals for the freezer it literally says to prepare and cook the recipe then freeze. Here's flank steak with this maranade, here's flank steak with this other maranade. Now cook and freeze. Well duh! I wasn't looking for a cookbook. I was looking for a book to help me create freezer meals. A totally different concept, I guess."
4,a decent intro to freezer cooking,"This is the first and only freezer cookbook I have so far. I've made about a dozen recipes in here and have had mostly good results. The ones that turn out best seem to be the cheesy casseroles, with cream of mushroom soup. Though we loved the baked spaghettti and the lemon/ dijon chicken.The book has no info on thawing the food. Many of the recipes tell you to bake for an hour before serving, omitting the fact that this dish, straight from the freezer needs to thaw out all day (or bake for 2-2.5 hours)!I've also had to modify a few to add more flavor. There were also a few ingredients (enchilada sauce, corn tortillas, ranch salad dressing in powder form) that I was unabale to find in several supermarkets.I still really got alot of use out of the book as it got me into freezer cooking, and do recommend it as a solid intro. Yes, there do seem to be alot of corrections. But I checked out the corrections list and the errors seems to be fairly minor."
4,"Good, could be better","I overall like the book. I thought it could have been better. It seems they are trying to come off as more gourmet, not as family friendly. But it has a well-deserved spot on my shelf."
3,Not what I expected,"I was so excited when I first heard about this book. It's a great idea--prepare signature Dream Dinners recipes from the comfort of your own home. But...many of the recipes I was hoping they would publish in the book are not included. And the recipes that are included look less than stellar. Were they afraid of printing too many of their signature dinner recipes for fear that it would turn people away from sessions? And where are the pictures? I thought they would at least print 2 or 3 pages with photos, but there is not one photo of a recipe included. ""Don't Panic: Dinner's in the Freezer"" by Suzie Martinez is a much better freezer meal cookbook. I guess I just expected a little more out from the founders of the country's #1 meal assembly business."
2,Great idea but too many errors,"I have been intrigued with the concept of the Dream Dinners and I bought the cookbook to hold me over until a franchise opens here in Canada. I love the little excerpts about conversation starters and the like and all of the low(er) fat ingredients but sadly, I've tried 3 recipes so far, and all of them came out horribly.I've contacted Dream Dinners and am waiting for their response. I'm apprehensive about trying the other recipes I've already bought the ingredients for. It's getting expensive throwing things out and making another dinner for my family and it sure isn't make my life any easier.Another thing that irritates me about this book is that many of the recipes cannot be frozen. Why include them in this book then??UPDATE: It took ages but Dream Dinners admitted to the errors and has finally posted corrections on their website."
1,not that good,"I purchased both the Super Suppers cookbook and this one as well for my family to have homecooked meals each night,there are no pictures and the book is confusing. I prefered the Super Suppers cookbook over this"
2,Would have returned if I could have,"I was really excited when I got the book, as I love the idea behind Dream Dinners. I have been to the store a couple of times and was ready to create some of the things I had there. Unfortunately none of the items that are in the store are in the book. The recipes that are in the book are not even close to being as good as the ones in the store either. The directions are not all that clear, there are no pictures, and as for reheating, I am not sure if the authors even tried to reheat the items as they all seem wrong when I do them. I would not recommend this book, there are several others out there that are better than this. If it hadn't been a gift I would have returned it. Dream Dinners could, and should have done a much better job than this."
4,A good selection of meals,"I have attended the various Dream Dinner sessions and the recipes in the book are exact replicas of what I have made there. Examples are: Cider Braised Pork Chops, Slow-cooked Barbeque Beef, etc. The meals are easy to do and a nice variety when you want something that tastes good and is easy to prepare after a long day at work. I have tried a few other freezer preparation meal cookbooks and this is by far one of the better cookbook choices. A great addition for those that like to do freezer cooking would be the Freezer Cooking Manual and the kitchen calculator as you can adjust the recipe portion size accurately and easily."
1,"REALLY, REALLY BAD!","I bought the book thinking what a neat idea to have things in the freezer for the nights when cooking or take out weren't an option. WRONG! Who ever wrote the book or tested the recipes just did not do a very good job. The instructions are vague and I had the topping of 2 recipes burn before the dish itself was cooked. I truly believe the recipes were NOT tested in a real kitchen with a real cook. Although the recipes look great, it's too much trouble to figure out how to ""fix"" them to make them edible."
3,A Bit Disappointed,I love Dream Dinners. I waited and waited for this book and I am a little disappointed. Recipes look ok ---not as many that look worth trying as I was hoping for----VERY few from the actual Dream Dinners franchise---or they are mostly older ones they dont use anymore. I was hoping to find some of my favorites that I could recreate at home so that I could enjoy them again!No luck! No pictures with any of the recipes --kind of a bummer.It does a great job at laying out the book as well as increasing portions.
2,Wait 'til it's reprinted,"This book has a few good recipes, but is not best of the books out there. Most of the recipes are not ""freezer to table"", if what you're looking for is something to just pull out of the freezer when you get home, as you would a TV dinner. No, these you have to let thaw completely before you cook them, which means you have to remember to pull them out of the freezer several hours ahead of time (something that doesn't always happen when you're busy). You're much better off cooking the entire batch, and then dividing them up into freezer portions so you can microwave them later for a quick dinner.Also, out of about 100 recipes, 20+ have errors. It's one thing to write in cookbooks with your own adjustments, but you shouldn't have to make corrections. Unless this book comes 'way down in price, you would be better off waiting until the next edition comes out so you can have a clean copy."
2,Not what I ordered,"I thought this item would have two dotted and two striped receiving blankets... I loved the soft cream and sage colours, which match a lot of my baby stuff, but I received on dotted, one striped, and two identical beige-coloured blankets with all these kiddie safari/zoo animals all over them. Personally, I hate that stuff, so I'll get rid of those two, but I really wanted the striped and dotted ones. Too bad. Waste of money."
3,An appetizer of the Franciscan charism.,"Truthfully, this merits closer to 3.5 stars. The reader can expect the same mystical, romance-filled style from Father Murray here with a very specific formula to follow Francis. Just as the appetite is whetted though, the text ends. Expect Bodo to briefly touch on his three prong approach in the 38 page ""booklet"". If you're after a Fransican review or a ""Reader's Digest"" version this is a nice read for one sitting. If you're after something more substantial and in-depth then look for his previous book, ""The Way of St. Francis""."
3,Readable but not much more,"These three books are OK. The first sequence (midnight to twilight :) ) are the best and I'm not even going to bother with the other 'Well World' books after these.My major problem with these is the author seems to have forgotten (or arbitrarily changed) things that happened in Echoes. In Echoes he has two of the entries (by inference Tony and the Colonel) going to specific hexes, but in the Shadow, suddenly Tony is a Dillian (when it was definitely stated only the girl went there in E) and the Colonel is a Leeming.Also why have the inhabitants of Hakazit changed from the first series? They WERE giant armoured red-eyed lizards and now they are man sized mosquito's. Did Chalker re-read his old stuff?That's the major problem. There's no consistency. And I've only pointed out a couple of the stuff up's."
3,A Shadow of the original series,"This is a pretty good yarn, and Chalker's gift of invention is displayed very well here - unlike in the first book of this series, which took place on Earth for the most part. Here we are back on the beloved Well World, and as usual, much of the enjoyment lies in discovering new alien races. Chalker's plot is not nearly as intense as the original Well series, though - the whole race to the Well seems forced and lacks urgency. Altogether an enjoyable read, but hardly a classic. Not even a pulpy, guilty-pleasure classic like the original series, which I highly recommend."
1,"Enough time wasted, don't waste yours.",Ordered the book. Sorry I did. Read the first 4 chapters. Sorry I did. Browsed the remainder of the book. Sorry I did. Returned the book. Glad I did.
4,History Quiz: NASDAQ Down 39.3% - In 2000 or 2008?,"The Trillionaire Next Door, The Greedy Investor's Guide to Day Trading, Andy Borowitz; HarperCollinsPublishers (2000)As good (funny) today as it was back when day traders were the villains, not today's Big Banks - but then again, Andy's advice actually worked - accidentally - for 50 of the day traders who today ARE the Big Banks (this explains their current demented business decisions & average robust stock price of $1.79/share).Yep, there they were in 2000, either dying on the vine or committing vigorous AK-47 workouts & then Andy bailed 'em out (eight years prior to Hank Paulsen's Federal Reserve sending out the whaling long boats to rescue them again during the Crash of 2008).What a pal, what a pal, what a pal."
3,For Humor Only,"I just borrowed this book, and I'm certainly glad it was a quick laugh for free. However, for those who expected to learn how to day trade and make huge bucks, they'll be disappointed. The good thing is, that you'll only need about an hour or two to read the entire book, and you'll probably get a good laugh out of it.I was impressed with how closely he describes the day-to-day life style of a day trader. I more or less felt like I was reading a blog by a young man who chose to skip college to start day trading obsessively while living in his parents home and quitting his job at Burger King. Honestly, I have no idea who he is, and if anythign he wrote is either fiction or his own memoire.All in all, pretty good entertainment, but the retail price printed on the book ($20) is not something I would have paid for myself for this quick comedy."
1,Forget about buying this book.,"This book was the worst investment of my life. Borowitz is not at all funny. It didn't even make me smile. This book is a waste of ink and paper and it's contents at the very least are downright stupid. A ten year old child has better humor. Save your money and read the daily comics, you'll be better off. I wanted to rate this book with no stars, but this form requires that field to be rated."
3,a somewhat incomplete music book,"I did this play last year in High School, and I lost my music to it. I like to have a full collection of the music I have done, and the addition of this music would be good... but incomplete. I want all the music."
2,"VERY,VERY BORING.PERIOD.","Don't buy this unless N Sync is not only your fav band but you have your ENTIRE room wall to wall *N Sync,you HONESTLY BELIEVE you and Justin(JC/Chris/Lance/Joey/whoever your main *N Sync man is) WERE meant to be together forever(you have a ring....the wedding will be huge!Your best friend Heather Tallman is going to be the maid of honor,Sara goes down with Christ,me with JC...so on,KIM!) and being deprived of one CRAPPY COVER WOULD KILL YOU.To all SANE people,DO NOT buy this cd,ever.PERIOD.Thank you,the rock goddess has spoken."
4,'N Sync: For the Girl Who Has Everything Import Single,"'N Sync has done it again! They've managed to take an oldie-but-goodie and transform it into something new! Their version of The Lion Sleeps Tonight couldn't be better! Chris definitely knows how to belt out the lyrics, and the background vocals of the remaining group members make for a perfect cover that's easy on the ears. Included in this import single are three versions of For the Girl. The acoustic version of this already wonderful song has a whole new feel to it. For the girl who has everything but not this single, what are you waiting for? I highly recommend this CD! Order a copy today."
5,A MUST HAVE CD FOR COLLECTION!,"I may be a guy, but I must say that NSync Has Got The Flow! They sure are the best music out and they are all great. This cd was excellent, I own it long with 12 other NSync cds!! This cd is just great and I like the Lion Sleeps Tonight song ion it....I used to sing it all the time when it was on the radio when I was little...LoL...and this version is even better than the older one!"

1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!,"My mom got me this CD import for Christmas. It was a waste of money because it was so horrible! Good god! Don't buy this, its so bad. In my eyes I made my poor mother waste her money on this CD that was horriblie. I think its time I switch back to BSB forever! Sorry everyone!"
1,Disappointed,"We have a couple Adam Sandler movies, one of which is ""Fifty First Dates"". It is a pretty good movie.After reading some of the reviews on ""Billy Madison"", we decided to try it. We were very disappointed.More than one of the reviews said something like if you just watch it for the humor, you will enjoy it.We tried, but it was just too gross and just plain stupid. Maybe we are too old and fuddy-duddy, butit was ""trashy"" to us..."
1,Idiotic,I didn't find any thing funny about this movie. What's funny about looking at dog doo and picking it up. Stupid. 'nough said.
5,Very funny!,I wasn't sure how good this movie was going to be but once i saw it i was laughing for weeks about it. It's really funny and if you like funny movies you should buy this.
5,OHHHH BILLYYY!!!!!!!,"Genius, Masterful, Wonderful!!!!!!!!! My goodness in an era where there is nothing original Adam Sandler set up a new genre of film(Grown Men Acting like children); Will Ferrel, Jack Black, & many others tried to duplicate with mixed success. This is the original to that legacy of movies."
5,The best comedy ever made,"Adam Sandler is becoming one of the most popular comedians in Sweden. Happy Gilmore was released on video only, but after its success, Wedding singer and Waterboy were box office hits. It's only a matter of time till the Swedes discover his early work such as the SNL sketches and, of course, the best movie of them all: Billy Madison."
5,"Exactly, Seatown viewer..","Adam is THEE Actor of the century and so many after the mellenium. Every movie he is in is funny, and exciting to watch again and again! Every one of his movies just make me crack up!! In Every movie that he stars in, the title is his! If you've never seen any of his movies, see it!! And go buy them, so you can laugh each time you see it. It's also great for slumber parties. Get all his movies, and you'l be crackin' up all night!!!2 Annie,Eve,Katia and Teara..the one's who bring out the craziest me...Suzie Q."
5,This movie rocks,I love this movie i love that huge penguin it is so hillarius and i cant get enough of adam sandler movies
5,Best Adam Sandler Movie,"This by far is the cream of the crop when it comes to Sandler's movies. Sandler acts like a child in this movie and perhaps thats why he fits so well with the plot. Sandler, or Billy is sent through k-12 education once again to earn his fathers respect and company. His childlike behavior can make everyone laugh. This movie is so filled with catch phrases, (stop looking at me swan; Erics pregnant, etc) that you may soon repeat them as well. There are also some cameo appearences by Chris Farley and Norm McDonald. IT also pokes fun at some of Adam Sandler's SNL characters (lunch lady song). The reason why this movie is 5 stars in my opinion is because it is all together a pretty good comedy, and at the end of the movie it does what every comedy should do, make you feel good."
3,This movie is so-so,"No offense to Adam Sandler fans who loved this film, I love goofy movies myself. But this film fell a bit short of my expectations. First of all, the romantic attraction between Billy and the teacher should have been further developed upon (the scene of her punching Billy in the pool is most curious). Sandler should have added more jokes (he practically played one), and he should have added more dialogue. The movie could have been better, I think.I love Adam Sandler films, my favorites being HAPPY GILMORE, LITTLE NICKY and THE WATERBOY. But this film is not his best, unfortunately. However, unlike the critics who trashed it, I will do this movie some credit. The scenes of Sandler singing in the pool and yelling at the students that he hates them and will never return to school (after making a spelling error), are hilarious. There ARE funny moments, but the real ones are sadly far and few (much like Will Ferrell movies). A decent film, but not Sandler's best."
2,A bit too juvenile for my taste,"I can't really say much good about this movie. There are a couple of moments in it worthy of a chuckle or two, but I generally feel that it falls more into the ""stupid"" category. I am giving it the benefit of the doubt with 2 stars instead of 1. Note that my review only regards Billy Madison, not Happy Gilmore, as Billy Madison is the one Amazon offered me the chance to review. Happy Gilmore was the better of the two in my opinion, however."
4,Four and a half actually,"Look at this retarted Adam Sandler. He does a much better drunk than Ozzy Osbourne is in real life. This movie will keep you laughing and some of the scenes are just classic. You'll love Sandler's new language (as seen when Eric makes fun of Billy). This movie is hillarious, funny, pure comedy, and most of filled with laughs. This is anINSTANT CLASSIC"
5,Adam Sandler is a pure genious,"Billy Madison is a grest movie, that sends up everything. The song and dance sequances were so funny, for true Sandler fans. It was great to see that other SNL cast members were in the movie, such as Norm MacDonald, whos lack of talent, make the movie even funnier. Some of the humor, may take awhile to get used to, but once your there it is so funny."
5,Best movie,Adam Sandler plays a 28 year old fool who wants to take over the family buisness. He makes a bet with his dad that he will repeat grades 1-12 in 12 weeks. With the help of his friends and taecher he does. If you like Adam Sandlers stupid roles like i do you will love this movie. It will keep you laughing with many memorable lines.
3,"A Fun, Yet Flawed Film.","First of all, I love Adam Sandler movies. They are some of the wittiest and goofiest movies around. This is no exception.That said, this film has a lot of offensive content. It is full of crude jokes, profanity, and the like.I left it feeling like I had just come from a very fun party, but done something wrong in the process."
3,Definately not Sandlers best performance!,"Dont get me wrong, I love Adam Sandler, and I love all of his other movies, but in this one, he acts very poorly with this badly written movie. I think some scenes are VERY funny, and some are just plain stupid. Farly is hilarious as the bus driver, but Sandler just wouldnt stop with those dumb voices."
4,A Stupid/Funny Movie Starring Adam Sandler,"This movie is good, but not as good as some of Sandler's other movies such as: Happy Gilmore, Wedding Singer... It is very funny though, but a stupid kind of funny.Billy (Adam Sandler) wants to be the heir of his father's company, and also just to make his dad proud. The deal is Billy must repeat all grades 1-12 in 2 weeks or else the company goes to one of Billy's dad's workers. Billy falls in love with the 3 grade teacher and wants to date her, but no luck, or at least not at first. Also, Billy hilucinates a few times and sees this imaginative penguin, which can give a few good laughs, but most of the humor in this movie is while Billy is in school (especially 3 grade).This is definetely a MUST SEE for any Adam Sandler fans out there.Special DVD feature's include:Production NotesCast and Filmaker's BiosFilm HighlightsTheatrical TrailerWeb Links"
1,A disgrace to the movie world,"This movie was the worst and most disgusting movie I have ever seen. The cast was a nightmare. I can't believe that Adam Sandler would ruin his reputation by being involved in this movie. This movie made me sick, and should be erased from the market all together. And to top it all off, there's a male principle that is hitting on Billy Madison. All in all, I absolutely hated this movie and I recommend never watching it."
1,"DUMB, AND DUMBER, THIS MOVIE IS STUPID!","IM SORRY, WHOEVER GAVE THIS MOVIE 4 AND A HALF STARS IS JUST DESPERATE AND WILL LAUGH AT ANY STUPID THING OUT THERE...THERE IS NOTHING GOOD IN THIS MOVIE..JUST BECAUSE ADAM SANDLER IS IN IT, DOESNT MAKE IT GOOD. WHAT WAS THE BIG PENQUIN ALL ABOUT? HOW DUMB WAS THAT? OK, THERE ARE A FEW MOMENTS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN OK, BUT THE WHOLE MOVIE BECAME SO LAME, THAT THE FEW FUNNY AREAS CANT CARRY THE REALLY DUMB PARTS..SAVE YOUR MONEY..UNLESS YOU ARE 15, THIS MOVIE IS JUST DUMB..NO, DUMBER..THAN ANYTHING ELSE OUT THERE"
5,Best Movie Ever!,"Billy Madison was the best movie I've ever seen! Everyone who has watched it so far has been overcome with laughter! It is NOT boring! If you haven't seen it, you definitely need to!"
4,pleased,it is a classic! my boyfriend loves it. he quotes the movie all the time. it something we grew up watching
4,The movie came in timely manner,The movie is a good comedy. I enjoyed it very much. Adam Sandler is an awesome actor.
5,Back to School,"I couldn't stop laughing starting after the first two seconds and stopping when the credits started. If you love down right hilarious movies, then you'll love this."
4,Not my favorite Adam Sandler movie...but soooo hillarious!,"This movie has such an original story line. Brian Madison is founder of Madison Hotels and is retiring and is wanting to leave the company to his son, Billy. However, Brian thinks his son is too irresponsible to run the company. Billy agrees to go back to school, 1st grade through 12, to prove himself.Although this is not my favorite Adam Sandler movie, it is still so hillarious. The characters in this movie are so funny, and there are many funny situations in which Billy finds himself in. All in all it's a pretty great movie!"
4,Pretty good press,"We've owned one for years and it's never let us down. I personally prefer wider, flatter burgers, but the ones produced by this press are still great."
5,Love it!,I love the whole series of Gooseberry Patch books. They give great tips & ideas such as decorating.
1,Poorly constructed product,"AVS tried to save on 3M(tm) Acrylic Foam Tape and leave graps in between bends and contour line. It is poorly done, the graps will allow rain water to drip in. THe vent visor makes high pitch sound if you drive above 50 mph on the highway. Not worth the effort and money. Try any other in-channel vent visor if you want your car to look nice and perfect fit.Toyota RAV 4 Limited."
4,Practical!,"Extremely practical and fun, it is not very comprehensive due to the audio format. But it is worth it."
4,Good and Healthy,"I've been buying this company's cookies for many years. They are tasty and don't seem ""weird"" although note that they have a rice-flour base, making them generally a tad crumblier and more delicate in flavor than cookies made with wheat flour. They remind me of a light, softer shortbread-type texture. Personally I find this to be an appealing difference, adding some variety in choice (I'm not gluten intolerant but have a mild wheat allergy, so I can still eat some wheat cookies as well). If you enjoy things like rice crackers, cream of rice, rice noodles and Asian dishes, you will probably like these and not find them strange. In essence, I'd describe these as a lighter, more delicate version of a chocolate-chip cookie."
3,Glutin-free cookies,"These cookies were better than the lemon ones, but still not as tasty as some of the other ones."
4,WONDERFULLY DELICIOUS COOKIES,"Pamela's Chocolate Chip Walnut cookie are wonderful as a final touch to a good day, as a pick-me-up when I need one, or as a bribe that I use to make myself finish an unpleasant task. Sometimes I have one just because it's there and so am I.P.S. My family loves them, too."
4,Delicious Wheat Free Chocolate Chip Cookies,This product is excellent for folks with food sensitivies...gluten/wheat free...it satisfies...the urge for chocolate...and it tastes yummy...recommneded very highly
1,I really did not like these cookies..,I am not trying to be mean or anything but these cookies very very dry and tasted very unpleasant.
5,sturdy,"My 3 y/o loved this with his costume! It's the perfect size with an easy to hold handle. It is sturdy and has held up throughout many drops/throws, no colors rub off."
5,awsome!,My soon loves this shield and so many of his friends ask him where did your mom get that shield.Hard and sturdy.
1,Never been so disappointed,"Waiting patiently for a response led to frustration. Assuming the product details were correct, I placed the order (THE TITLE DID SAY CAPTAIN AMERICA SHIELD COSTUME!!) I received the package today and was horribly disappointed to find no muscle costume, no hood, and a shield that was made out of the same plastic as a party cup! It is not suitable for children of ANY age. I am still waiting on a response!! Not a trusted seller and the whole description was a complete lie. Not appreciated. Especially 4 days before Christmas!!"
1,Movie tie in for PG-13 Movie? Unacceptable!,"Even the sales information says for ""Ages 7 - 11."" The film is rated PG-13. Doesn't anyone else think this is inappropriate for toy companies to market toys to children based on movies they are too young to watch? Proof the toy companies care MUCH more about their profits than the well being of their customers, our children."
4,"Definitely for kids, but still super cool!","Cons:The blue should be a bit darker. The elastic straps are flimsy. The shield's edge is about a half-inch too deep. The plastic attachments for the straps are too close to the center. The glue used to adhere the strap attachments causes a slight ripple on the other side of the shield that can be seen at certain angels.Pros:None of the things mentioned above matter to a child receiving their own Captain America shield. The strap have hook-and-loop ends that allow for easy adjustment. The star and stripe outlines are embossed into the plastic. The price is very affordable for an officially licensed Marvel product.All-in-all, this is a respectable ~$15 shield than can be modified by parents with too much time on their hands to overcame nearly all the cons mentioned above: http://www.instructables.com/id/Ultimate_WW2_Captain_America_Costume/"
5,nice shield,this is made of plastic so don't let the little captain americas throw it very hard or try prolonged skidding on the grass
5,My Son Loved the Shield,"We ordered the Captain America shield for an upcoming superhero themed birthday party. The costume was just not complete without the shield. The order came right on time and my son was so excited about getting the shield.He was the hit of the birthday party. The shield is lightweight, but very durable. Perfect for a three-year old. We will definitely order from this company again. Their customer service was quick to respond and courteous."
