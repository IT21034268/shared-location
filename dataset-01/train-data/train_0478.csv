3,Psycho-Analytical,"This is a new perspective about ""Love and Fame"", and so it emphasizes the women he loved. I have read other bios. of Nelson, where the authors seem to know Nelson better. Here in this bio., Vincent gives psychological explanations for the motivations of Nelson, and gets them wrong. The author seems to be a 21st-century person explaining an 18th-century man in today's terms, and ultimately not understanding him. Nevertheless, the numerous large, color pictures of Nelson and his very lovely Lady Hamilton were wonderful additions."
2,An obviously self-serving book,"Almodovar has created an obviously self-serving book. If you believe her story, everything she ever did was for the good of mankind and she was simply a victim of a corrupt police department. She tries to make us believe she was the most honest, hardworking meter maid who ever worked for LAPD; then the most sought-after, sensitive, sensuous call girl anyone could ever fantasize. Sorry, I just can't believe her story! The quality of writing is even worse!"
4,Alan Wilder's incredible musical understanding,"I am a BIG Depeche Mode fan, thus i bought Bloodline the year it came out - couldn't find Hydrology back then -. It is such an impressive piece of work. ""Edge to Life"" is one of the best songs that you can make love along. It includes lots of stuff from Depeche Mode, and things that Wilder would use later in his Recoil albums. Douglas McCarthy formerly from Nizter Ebb, includes a song here - buy Nitzer Ebb stuff too -. Wilder is like a shy electronic fella, he hangs around with the most talented people out there - Diamanda Gal√°s, Flood, DM, Tony Halliday -, but still, has not made a huge hype from his stuff. That i admire from him, that and his incredible music."
4,A Little Bit of Everything,"Funk, blues, rap, pop, soul, all wrapped up in an electric blanket. It's all very well-crafted, though a bit robotic-sounding. Still, ""Bloodline"" is worth the price of the album."
4,a warm-hearted tale of a cold-blooded plot.,"After having read all of Bernhardt's Justice books, I knew this would not be a boring story. I was not disappointed. It's a fast read, and hard to stop after the first thirty or so pages. Part of it is predictable (in a good way), but the end twist, I must confess, I didn't see it coming. Nice story to gear up for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I have to recommend it."
5,Great book,This book warmed my heart. Once I started reading it I couldn't stop. I truly enjoyed reading this book. I highly recommend this book.
3,Short and pleasant,"All I can say is that this short pleasant story focus the intrigue on the behavior of the characters, (the different members of a typical family) and its plot, fast paced and plenty of action also gives room for some reflections about the meaning of Christmas and the relationship between parents and their children. Finally, after a sudden turn of events disclosing the nature of the mystery, the suspiciously obvious ending comes naturally."
1,WORST EVER,Don't even stop to look at it 1 star becouse it's the most boringest toy EVER 5 stars for education for kids to know NOT TO BUY JUNK! and one star of durable becouse i was brushing her hair at the FREAKING brush break in TWO!!!!! the hair was falling out and the crown didn't fit very well you can't even put make up on i love cinderrella sooo i bought it was of my money the only thing fun about this was i cut her hair realy short and died it Blue and Pink with green streeks and put blue nail polish on her lips and I throw it out and on the big forhead(thats after i cought the bangs off) I wroght PIECE of JUNK!!!Don't buy it
3,"cute, bit predictible.","Light, uplifting comedy. Not a lot of depth to characters. Perhaps could have taken advantage of more comedic moments that were possible with this storyline."
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT,2nd time trying to buy this movie. Wife's favcorite. Both versions have subtitles LOCKED On and crappy sound. Tried to order before and received the same crappy defective quality disk.
4,Dave,"i think the movie was very entertaining... nothing heavy, its a movie showing someone who looks like the president replace him while he goes and has an affair and gets the chance to take over the presidency and starts running the country. they try to show that because he is an outsider, he is more innocent... therefor not being part of all the """" in the U.S. government. its a cute movie but is more on the fictional side. i can probably compare this movie to pretty woman, the wedding planner... those kinda stuff..."
1,Slow moving with not a lot of content,"I watched it simply because of all of the high customer reviews. However, I was truly bored with the movie and I don't understand why it keeps getting these glowing reviews. I kept waiting for something more to happen or a plot twist. Anything. But it was dull and easily predictable throughout the whole movie."
1,Language,I was disappointed in the video because of the foul language. When I saw it on TV the foul language must have been deleted.
5,don't miss this one!,"Love everything about this movie - the cast, the story - Always makes me feel good to watch it - Dave is a real hero!"
3,"It's alright, but disappointed me.",It's just OK. Scenes are missing from this DVD. It's been cut! I thought this was the full movie but it isn't.
4,Cute and Funny,I have watched this movie over and over again and each time I fall in love with Kevin Kline. There are two great reasons to watch this movie....a quick cameo appearance of Oriole Park at Canden Yards...and the scene where Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver sing for a cop is a great laugh. This is a charming movie worth watching multiple times.
2,Product Review,"There is no question that the movie itself is a winner. Most enjoyable, yes!It is the DVD that leaves a lot to be desired. The DVD is VERY grainy. I played this DVD on Blu-Ray player and it was very grainey.I also played this DVD on a standard DVD player, and the DVD was again grainey. I would not recommend this DVD to anyone!I regret not purchasing the original version."
5,Dave,"Since I love Kevin Kline, this movie shows his special flare for comedy and as usual there is always a message for those of us who look for it,"
5,The Best!!!,"This is one of the best movies that I have ever had the pleasure to watch. I am a HUGE Kevin Kline fan and he is so amazing in this role. I probably watch this movie 6 times a year. Yes, I have a life....but that is just how good this movie is. It's such a joy and heatwarming piece of cinema."
5,Love old movies,Just wanted my own copy to watch whenever I want.Excellent storyline with a great ending.
4,If you liked MOON OVER PARADOR...,"If you liked Paul Mazursky's MOON OVER PARADOR with Richard Dreyfuss and Sonia Braga, you'll like DAVE, because it is exactly the same plot set in America. Of course, the actors make this version well worth watching and the director did a nice job. You can pretty much predict where the plot will go, especially if you saw the original. But it's a nice little diversion."
5,Dave,Most awesome movie. Should be watched by the ultimate romantic who still carries hope for the true American way. A must have in any collection.
5,Wonderful--You'll watch it over and over,"This is a great story, entertaining, fun, with laughter and pathos mixed in, much like life itself. You'll find yourself watching it over and over again; it is a ""feel-good"" movie that will leave you smiling. Kline and Weaver give outstanding performances."
5,one of the best movies of this type :-),I had this movie on VHS and watched it so many times it was worn. I am delighted to finally find it on DVD. It is as timeless as our national debt ... very well done without bad language.
4,Still current,"Dave is not a new movie, but I believe it is important this year after all the devious and crooked things that happened in the past presidential election. It could be vital to our democracy to remember that what politicians say and what they do can be two different things. Greed for power is very well exemplified in Dave--even though it seems like a comedy, the message is very serious."
4,Lighthearted and Refreshing,"I work on Capitol Hill and thoroughly enjoyed this love story/comedy. Its idealistic approach to Washington was refreshing and uplifting. Kevin Klien was a perfect casting choice.Watch this film for some good laughs and for a lighthearted escape into a world where hope and optimism are abundant.P.S. There really are politicians like Dave in Washington (Congressman Wally Herger, Congressman Jeff Flake and Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton)"
3,Dave,"This dvd has some scenes cut from the original movie. For a person who has seen the original, the dvd is a disappointment. I have read about this type of cutting on other dvds. This is the first one I have come across. The movie is great; the cuts are not."
4,no title,"Wonderful-feeling movie. The same tone as ""Groundhog Day"". Immensely enjoyable - Kevin Kline was just right."
4,Average Film,"As much as I like Kevin Kline, this film is just an average film. I enjoyed watching it and would recommend it as a family film. I might watch it again. I prefer the film, ""American President"""
5,"James Newton Howard's Music is a ""stand-alone""","This original movie score is one the composer's best. Even if you haven't seen the movie (which you should, by all means), the music is delightful all on its own. The ""Dave"" theme is gently interwoven and proves to be the thread that ties it all together in a beautiful package. An absolute pleasure to listen to."
4,Sweet movie. A definite feel good movie.,"One of those movies that makes you feel good about the world. I realize that it's wishful thinking, but I always think that if there arethat many people out there who are as touched by a movie like this as me, there is still a lot of goodness in the world."
3,Leaves much to be desired...,"I bought this book to learn more about one of my favorite musicians. Instead, this book simply provides random quote after quote. I didn't learn anything from this book that I didn't know before, it provided very little insight into the artist himself. It was also very short (only 95 pages). Hardly enough to describe anything in detail. One plus though, were the photos. Seeing pictures of Peter Gabriel in concert was a great quality of the book. If you want a light read about a great musician, then this is the book for you. If you really want to learn something about the artist himself, look elsewhere."
2,SO DISAPPOINTING!,"When I bought this book, I thought it would be more of an autobiographical type of book. I was so disappointed to find out that all it is, is a compilation of quotes from Peter Gabriel over the years.Yes, there were a few interesting facts to be found in it, but nothing that would really, truly give anyone a feeling that they finished the book knowing any more about this brilliant artist than they probably already knew... it simply stated a topic.. and then followed with a few pages of various quotes on that subject by Gabriel. Not what I expected by any means. Not worth the money in my opinion. You could probably get more info through Google or any other site like that. Don't waste your money on this."
5,Real truck treads for mini monster trucks!!,"First Off, awesome set of tires. My T-Maxx goes whereever I point it with these tires. Biggest reason I bought these tires is that I have a set of tires with the same tread on my '95 Jeep, so I know that they work and work very well. Also a big plus is they are already setup and glued to the rim."
5,I have bought 25 of these cookbooks for friends,"I didn't want anymore cookbooks, but every time I went to a party in Lexington and loved a recipe, it was from this book. I had to have it! Most cookbooks have a few good recipes. This cookbook has a few so-so recipes and lots of unbelievable ones. Every person who I bought this cookbook for has also bought it as gifts for several others. We just moved to Pittsburgh and I prepared some of the simple recipes for parties. They were always the hit of the party. Instead of repeatedly giving out recipes, I have begun to give the name of the book. The proceeds go to children's charities in Kentucky. Can't miss with this cookbook - and it's beautiful as well.Creating a Stir"
5,knitting,This is an excellent book whether you're a beginner or a professional.I would recommend it to anyone looking for information on how to knit or crochet.
3,Not a Beginner's Book,"If you are a beginner and need lots of visual images in order to understand how to knit, this isn't the book for you. I have another Vogue book and for some reason, the instructions and the steps on how to do a special stitch don't make sense to me. The Vogue books are written in such a way that it assumes that the reader has some understanding of the ""knitting"" terminology and some background in knitting. When I started, I didn't understand the terminology. Now that I have been knitting for a while, I have gone back to my Vogue books and it has made sense. However, I strongly state that if you are a brand new knitter OR are just learning to knit, don't buy this book. Wait until you have learned the terminology and have had a little experience in knitting."
4,Basics,"A nice book with basic instructions on cast on, bind off, increase, decrease, etc. The patterns are not so great, you can find nicer ones in other books (Barbara Walker's, for instance). Not much about finishings... Might be a disappointment for experienced knitter."
5,Same as previous Vogue Knitting just new patterns,"This book is the Absolute Bible in knitting! I recommend it for all of my beginning students. They are amazed at how much of what they learn is in the book and so much more. One student bought the book several weeks after our first class and she was trying things on her own that she had seen in book.It's the exact same book as the previous Vogue Knitting book, it just has updated patterns in the back. The patterns aren't beginner's patterns, much like the ones in the previous book weren't. For a great reference book, you can't beat the Vogue Knitting book. If you find a previous edition used and cheaper than this one new, pick it up and you'll wonder how you got along without this book."
5,Best Reference,"Whether you are a beginner or an advanced knitter, this book offers a wealth of information. Each technique is accompanied by clear and helpful diagrams, as well as a description of what is going on in the picture. I found this particularly helpful because I am a learner who needs to see what is happening in order to duplicate it. As an advanced beginner, I learned a great deal from this book. The chapters on finishing techniques and blocking were very informative and I was able to apply them directly to my work. The book also provided inspiration for all that is possible with knitting and fiber arts.A great resource for any knitter's library--do not pass this one up!"
4,Reference Book for serious knitters,"If you love knitting this is an excellent addition to your library. The book is beautifully laid out and wide-ranging. The introductory history of knitting section is particularly interesting. There isn't an area of knitting that it doesn't touch on. However, if there is an area of knitting--e.g. knitting in the round--that you want to explore in depth, you'll have to go to another book."
5,Knitting in CA,"The most excellent reference book! It's loaded with knitting techniques, knitting stitch patterns, some sweater patterns, design techniques, etc. Perhaps in the next revision of this book, they will use larger, darker print, and update the sweater patterns which are much too 1980's looking (imho). If you are a beginning knitter, Sally Melville and Debbie Bliss have excellent books on learning to knit. Once you have learned the ""basics"" of knitting, buy Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book -- it's a ""must have"" book (despite the small print)!!"
5,Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book!,"If you want a one stop, everything you ever needed to know book, this is the one! I had friends tell me about this book and I kept thinking, oh, well, someday -- now I know what they were saying! It is by far the best knitting book I've ever seen and I can assure you, you will not be disappointed! AWESOME!!"
5,My new best friend,"Before this book, I was afraid of knitting needles, but The Ultimate Knitting Book was my salvation. The instructions are easy to follow, but only if you are good understanding instructional drawings.The only thing which is not practical about this book is that its not spiral-bound, and does not fit in my purse!I really recommend this book!Have a great day!"
5,Lots of illustrations as needed for reference and learning.,"Vogue Knitting is a very complete reference book. It is well worth the money because it includes different types of stitches, correcting mistakes, and even how to design your own pattern. It has lots of photographs and illustrations that make learning a new technique a breeze."
3,Pretty Pastels,"You would think this film was made in the 1960s, rather than the 1990s. It has a grainy look to it, but that is not a bad thing. There are many beautiful images here, in soft, welcoming colors. The plot is a bit thin. There is a gratuitous nudity scene near the start of the film that serves almost no purpose. If you liked ""Farewell My Concubine"" or ""Shanghai Triad,"" then you should enjoy this too."
2,Falsely advertised!,"This product is shown as ""blasting"" water when in fact it sprays a gentle stream of water that shoots about 10 feet. The person sitting on the hammerhead has to draw up water by compressing the handles and there is not very much water pressure. It's an OK toy...not worth $35."
2,Hazard????,Bought this exact model elsewhere. It is well made and looked nice but I haven't seen any birds visit during the 3 weeks it's been hanging. Noticed quite a glow of sun through the glass and just dicovered the plants underneath are scorched and several even have apparent burn marks. What might have happened had they been very dry?I'm giving two stars instead of one as I'm thinking I should have known better :(
1,Don't Do It !!!!,"First I had a very hard time loading this game. Finally got it loaded and then got a ""script"" error when I started to play the game. Went to the website and found a patch. Downloaded it and things seemed to work fine until I got to the ""Gold Room"" where I got another ""Script"" error. Went back to the website to look for a fix and the website had changed. Now they were offering a free download of another game if you had bought a ""boxed"" version of another game. While I was reading that a window popped up from my Norton Internet Security 2010 saying it had blocked a HIGH Security risk virus from downloading. I then had a very hard time getting out of the website. I double checked my History file to make sure I had entered the correct website sddress. I had. I then sent the company an email about the ""script"" error and the virus problem with their website. So far no answer. So much for Tech. Support."
1,Should be: Riddle of the Sphinxter,"Preview Title says is all, Dont waste your money on this one. I wish I could get my money Back!"
4,Nice obsession away from work!,"I never played adventure games before and I'm more likely to after playing this. The game is not violent and you solve a series of puzzles given different clues. I thought the puzzles were most difficult in the beginning before you even get to anything intersting in the tombs. FYI--If you get really, really stuck, plenty of people have written instructions on the internet on how to solve stuff. (You may have to utilize this once like I did just to get a feel for how to solve these things).I will forewarn you that the game can get sometimes stuck/slowed down. There is a patch available to stop it from doing that in certain sections, but it can still get frustrating in certain spots why you can move a lightning speed in some areas and at a snail's pace in others."
1,Waste of Money. Do not Buy!!!,This game does not work. All $9 copies in the market have the same problem. On the website they say download the patch. I did and the patch did nothing. It is a big shame on the company to release a game with all these problems. They suppose at least to withdraw all bad copies from the market everywhere but instead they deceive people by a patch that does not work. What if somebody does not have internet? What a waste!
1,waste of money,I love puzzle/brain teaser games and looked forward to playing this but unfortunately couldn't get it to work. AT ALL! I tried on three computers before giving up. I wish I could give it a zero star rating just for the sheer frustration I experienced and the time I wasted.
1,doesnt work on the vista program!,I BOUGHT THIS AND INSTALLED IT AND TRIED TO PLAY THE GAME. IT SHOWED ME AN ERROR MESSAGE THAN I NEEDED A DIFFERENT PROGRAM AND TRIED TO FIND THE PROGRAM I NEEDED TO DOWNLOAD BUT CAN'T FIND IT SO I HAVE THE GAME BUT CAN'T PLAY IT. IF ANYONE CAN HELP ME FIND THIS PROGRAMOR SO I COULD PLAY THIS GAME PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE.AQUACOW57
4,Survey of an American religious phenomenon,"Cuneo is thorough in his research and lucid as a writer. Even though I am trained in theology and psychology, I had no idea how widespread the exorcism phenomenon is in the USA. I'm grateful for this informative report. (...) the bulk of this book relates the author's wide-ranging interviews and personal observations of numerous exorcisms and ""deliverance"" events. Occasionally, by his own admission, Cuneo's descriptions sound a bit cartoonish, but I don't read these as his attempt to belittle these individuals. Overall, the tone is skeptical, but not judgmental or ridiculing. As often as not, Cuneo exhibits respect for many of the practitioners of these ministries and for their clientele. I find this essential reading for students of modern American religion."
4,Well Researched Book,"Well written and generally smooth reading book with lots of documented research material to further study. Michael Cuneo has done a very good job from a third party perspective apparently unbiased. Any person doing research on the subject of exorcism would do well to include this book which taps on many historical facts primarily from the 1960's to the present. The author points out that ""if"" satan and truly horrendous satanic activities exist in the United States, they for the most part have been well hidden. I commend Michael Cuneo on his work and will keep this book in my own library as a good reference."
3,"more ""deliverances"" than exorcisms","The book has more information on charismatic, Penecostal, and evangelical ""deliverances"" from demonic oppression (being harassed by a demon), than on exorcisms proper. The stories are interesting, as can be expected, mostly on the basis of how strange people behave rather than any supernatual manifestations.The author is even-handed, the book easy to read, and he proposes some interesting ideas about the influence of popular culture on religious behavior. Definitely a more reliable guide to what's really going on in this area than most of the schlock out there.--Alan Zundel, The HeartAwake Center"
3,disapointed,"The book was an easy read. they played down a lot of exorcist, and some need to do more homework on the subject"
3,rrright...,"I got this book because I'm interested in the subject of demonology and exorcism. The book is very promising at first, and it keeps you wanting to turn the pages. But after a while, it gets really tiring. The listing of so many facts and names make it hard to follow.I understand that research and documenting is essential to such kinds of works, but after a while the average reader will get bored."
1,Danny Devito and Michelle Pfeiffer at their worst,"I was really hoping for an old-school Batman movie, having enjoyed many of the others. And Michael Keaton is excellent as always, and the script and music and effects and sets etc. are all AOK.The problem with the movie is that Danny Devito makes and absolutely repulsive Penguin, showing absolutely no sign of class. He goes out of his way to look and sound like a pig as he devours whole raw fish, for example, leaving bloody guts on his hands and face. This is not the Penguin I came to appreciate as a kid.Almost as bad is Michelle Pfeiffer. She is sadly obnoxious as Catwoman, looking fantastic but acting like an idiot and completely out of place.I very much wanted to like this movie, and was willing to give it a lot of slack...but it just left me with an unhappy and sick feeling by the time it was over. Devito and Pfeiffer totally missed it here and spoiled the whole movie for me."
4,The best in it's weight class,The size of this bag is amazing it comes with its own compression bag and is like 6 inches in diameter and about 10 inches long. Smaller than a football and yet the 600 DownFill Bag still keeps me comfortable at temps in the low 40's. Another plus is that the bags are sold in left and right hand models so they can be zipped together with your sweety pie next to you.
3,"Good Pads - Not Large Enough, Too Expensive","I think I have tried almost all pads sold by Amazon, this is how I would rate them:Prevail: (Super Absorbent, best, Fluff, very good)Precision Pet: (Good, too expensive)Iris (pretty good, cheap, too small)Out (cheap but not that good)Hartz (same as above)Arm & Hammer (worst)If you have a small dog, then these pads are pretty good, my dog is quite old and weights 32 lbs. I need to put several pads and find the Prevail Super Absorbent to be the best by far for about the same price as these. I will not pay over $40 for a pad of this size again. I took a star off for price and another for size, which is still larger than all the other ones mentioned but not nearly as large as Prevail for about the same price."
5,Precision Pet WEE WEE PADS,I have been using this product for some time now and it does not dissanpoint me to this day.The quality meets my 100 percent expectation and I would recommend this product to all who reads this review.
4,Phantasmic Bill of Fare,"This is a nice collection of French short stories, but very specifically 19th century supernatural/fantastic type tales. Of course every reader will have his or her own favorites from the bill of fare, but for my part, the only authors I could have done without were Verne--who seemed out of place with his Hoffmannesque Master Zacharius--and Gerard de Nerval, who apparently was going mad when he wrote Aurelia--I felt as if he were trying to drive me mad when I read it! But most everything else in the anthology is enjoyable. Some standouts include Merimee, Gautier, and Dumas. The editor also provides an excellent introduction to the tales and authors. So for anyone who has a yen to feast on some fantastic 19th century French short stories, Demons of the Night will certainly serve up a delightful read."
5,Village Diary,"Village DiaryI loved the way that this book was written in particular, broken down by month. Each chapter flew by. Gossip about Miss Read and Mr. Mawne, the coming of new babies, weather, the pageant and other goings-on of the village made this book hard to put down.Fairacre is a most lovable village and one that is close to my heart. Even Mrs. Pringle with her meddlesome ways will squirm her way in there. You will find yourself looking for every Fairacre book there is, staying up all night, not being able to get enough of this delighful little village!"
1,Kindle version stinks,"Too many typos, especially for over $9. I've seen this in the free books but never in one I paid for. Very distracting. Don't waste your money."
1,Miss Read Kindle Books,"All of Miss Read's Kindle books have typos on almost every page. 10 bucks a pop for the books, so do you think we could get a better quality read? I have been complaining about this for months. With no results. It is very distracting to have to stop the flow and figure out what the misspelled words really are and fit them into the context. As I have said before, these reviews don't produce any positive results and don't mean a hill of beans."
2,village diary,"l a sorry but l do love this series but when l was reading this one it made me think the school mistress makes me upset she says she loves being alone, breaks her arm and everyone flies to help her poor mres pringle that she can't stand is there and says she will come everyday and make her breakgast etc. thats not living alone when you need to be done for, plus the teacher is the offered a paid for trip to crete come on whats the odds of that happening. no am getting tried of this l can do it all attiude by this lady, mrs. pringle dose all the cleaning at the dark old school house which is never enough for the teacher. so don't take it all as england way back when it isn't and reading this one book opened my eyes wide."
5,Trapper - for the younger set,"I was in second grade when I fell in love with the series. My friends at school reccomended I should read it. I was (like I am now) smart then, reading eighth grade books. But since the baby seal on the cover lured me in, I had no choice. After ward, I scavenged every where for it. READ IT. IT'S EASY AND WHOLESOME!"
1,A strange work indeed,"It amazes me that when students of Sin The' review his books, they automatically give it 5 stars. Does objectivity have no meaning to them? I have no personal knowledge of Sin The', his style, nor experience with his students. I am simply reviewing this book on its own merits, and it is a mish mash of strange material and really isn't worth the paper it's printed on. I am lucky I din't have to shell out my own money to view this one."
2,Average entry,"in an up and down series. Goodkind promises us that this is the first of three to end the series, and I would wait for that last book and the reviews before I read any of them. (By the way, that is my advice for Jordan and Martin as well, but esp. Jordan. I get mad every time I think about that guy!)"
3,Going downhill......,"This series started out so great - the first four books were phenomenal! After that, it almost seems like it's not even the same person writing the books anymore. Past Book 5, it seems like half of what you are reading is a rehash of the previous books, and 1/4 of it some sort of weird philosophical serman, leaving not very much to actually enjoy. Even the characters are very different, I find myself hating some of the people I used to love. I hope by the time the series wraps up that Terry has returned to his original style."
1,Utterly RIDICULOUS!,"The entire premise of this book is just ludicrous. One of the main characters vanishes and no one but Richard can remember her? She is the entire reason he ever left Westland and became the Lord Rahl! Without Kahlan he would still be ""just a woods guide"", there was no impetus to ever leave Westland.The storyline is so stale now I could care less about Richard and Kahlan, they've become irritating and insipid. The most interesting characters are Zedd, Ann & Nathan, and Berdine!"
3,Better than the some of the previous but still dull,I'm not sure why I'm still reading SoT especially after the last few which I didn't care for at all. My favorite of the series remains the early books because they was special to me at the time I read them years ago. Ths is way too long and seems more like a rehash until the next one (Phantom). It is better than Pillars of Creation and Naked Empire.
2,WTH is this book about?,"Like all the readers of Terry Goodkind, i loved the 2 first novels of the sword of truth. But enough is enough. A full book about the madness caused by Kalhan missing. We do not advance in the story one bit. Although we see Richard in a new way, I actually want to see the end of this serie before im 40 (now im 24). We must compare this serie to the whell of time of Robert Jordan, and must say that M.Goodkind doesnt have the same writting abilities on the ever going, fun to read, story. If there is no more then 2 books, i suggest you read it, but it wont make a big difference if you dont. By far the worst book Terry Goodkind made in this serie"
2,More pain thanks to Goodkind (2.5 stars),"Well, what is left to say about Goodkind? He still claims that he doesn't write fantasy and that his books are about human interaction/etc. Sadly this latest in the SoT series doesn't measure up to his earlier works such as Wizards 1st which were at least decent reads. As is normal with Goodkind he rehashes a fairly stale plot with his same cardboard cutout and inane characters. This book is better than his last offering by far, but that isn't enough to get Goodkind out of the hole he has dug for himself.Goodkind continues however to offer bocks for the lite fantasy reader which seems to be his forte, those that like his style (or lack thereof) should continue to enjoy his series Those of us that just read Goodkind because we like to abuse ourselves after getting sucked in by a couple decent books at the beginning of the series will continue to suffer at the hands of a guy that is bringing new meaning to the term ""hack""."
2,"short story, long","This book tells a story that could have been told in one fifth of time that the author uses. The story points get repeated over and over again, not adding to the narrative, just dulling the reader. If you are invested in this series, as I am, read the first five chapters and then the last five. The middle is not the stuff of the first books of this series. The philosophy/politics in this book would not bug me so much if it was part of the story. But this whole book was written to push the ideas. That is why there is so little action in Chainfire. The ideas get pushed down our throat though -- a leader has to go it alone -- he's the only one who really knows what is going on. And another idea that the author brings out toward the end, torture is justified if it is for a just cause.So read the beginning and end. Skip the middle. I wish I had."
2,Get this one in the library - or skip,"The same old, the same old... As much as I liked the first books in the series - and even gave them my personal ""Best ever written fantasy (after Tolkien)"" prize, as much I was struggling through ""Chainfire"". There is nowhere to go, nothing more to develop in the characters - so Mr. Goodkind includes more and more philosophy - instead of telling stories, as it is expected. The result is disappointing. All of you, who have seen Matrix re-loaded, re-furbished and re-installed, know the feeling.I guess the real skill that fantasy writers should master, it's realizing when to stop the sequels ( My applause to Dave Dunkan, who knows how to do it and best wishes to JK Rowling).PS I am still going to buy ""Phantom"" next March, hoping for the miracle: after all, I liked ""Pillars of Creation""(7) more than ""Faith of Fallen"" (6)"
1,Thanks to all reviewers - I am not going to buy this book!,"I will invest this money to another book...Problem is that... Hallowed Hunt I've alerady red...George Martin is long overdue with his last book, Jordan is no better than Goodkind, my beloved Robin Hobb is also getting worse... In Sci-Fi only Saga of Seven Suns is worth it - at least it is full of action... Turtledove finished his Lizard series - quite disappointing, really...So what the hell I will read???"
2,Its Like a Cheap Harlequin Romance Paperback,"Here's the whole book in a nutshell: ""Boy loses girl, Boy can't even find girl until the next book"". So, I am still wondering how that could take 667 pages, and does not even produce an ending.There were some creative elements to the plot but the preaching and rehashing from previous books (Goodkind can cut and paste with the best of them), diluted what could have been a welcome break to Goodkinds downward spiral.I have read all 9 of this series and they startd out GREAT but it seems each one has less meat in it. This one was just a sappy story, and reduced the great Richard Rahl to just a High School kid who lost his girl. This thing should be in the Romance section and NOT in the Science Fiction/Fantasy section. How the mighty have fallen: both Richard Rahl and Terry Goodkind!"
4,Don't start at night,"I thought this was a really good book, even if it dosen't end well. Don't start reading this book at night, you won't be able to put it down until the next morning."
2,didn't get cover image on my Kindle,I was very disappointed that I did not get the cover image for this book on my Kindle. I've received other covers with other books in this series before. Customer service could not find any solution to this problem. Not having the cover reduced my enjoyment of this book.
2,Boring,Probably the most boring book I have ever read. I was hoping it would get better but I had to put it down halfway through. I liked Wizard's First Rule though.
2,Rehashing covered ground...,"While Mr. Goodkind has introduced some new elements to the story line, it's mostly a rehash of previous books. The main plot drags while Richard keeps remembering past events, as if someone would actually read the 9th volume in a series without having read the first eight. It is also grating to see the same troubles rehashed. Richard and Kahlan separated, bad things happening, evil and dispair looming, world about to end, etc. etc. (yawn) Been there, done that. I would almost believe that Goodkind has taken a page from Robert Jordan's guide of ""How to Drag Out a Series to Make More Money""."
5,Magnificent!,"This is one of the better books that I have read. Terry Goodkind is a terrific author who has been able to hold our interest in this series for years. I believe he yet again proved his unique and quite talented form of writing. Not only did he grab our attention with another outstanding book, but he also was able to make it a compelling piece of work by giving to us the basic truths of life, and philosophy we all ourselves believe. Once the book is read, you can't help but think about the truth of it all, and try to apply everything said within it in everyday life. This book was magnificent, and I belive that it deserves no less than a 5."
2,Invisible Wife?,"As with all books, after book one of a series, the author is obligated to bring all readers 'up to speed' with backstory. We are well into the series now and this author fills in backstory endlessly to the point of boredom. If I were not hook on the story, I would have shelved the book. There is an awful lot of exposition ... the why of what is happening. It does get tedious.In this effort, we finally find out what is causing Kahlan's problem and determine what might happen if it is undone... the book then leaves the reader hanging... No real conclusion. a let down."
4,Goodkind Picks Up the Pace,"After a couple of volumes where the plot hardly moves, Goodkind gets things moving in this book. We get an Idea of just how dangerous this magic that Richard and Kahlan are fighting against and how little time there is to save everything!"
4,complicated but enjoyable,"If you are a hard core fantasy fan, this book won't let you down.In fact, if you are new to Terry Goodkind like I was, this book # 9 is a must read because it contains quite a lot of flashbacks/references to previous volumens.But if you don't have the patience or if you don't enjoy stories that are grand in scheme and complex in structure, then skip this one.There is no dragon slaying, but plenty of original/unique magic to keep one entertained."
3,It seems like he added filler to strech one good book into 2 ok books.,"I've read the entire series up to and including Phantom at this point, and I've got to say that Chainfire and Phantom were the two books I was least impressed with. My big complaint about these two books is that it seems like they should be (and maybe once were) one book. I get the distinct feeling that there is enough plot here to make one really good novel, but to make a few extra bucks they added a lot of useless filler. To make matters worse, the useless filler is the same in both books. If you cut out the parts of these two books that are essentially the same, you'd end up with a great novel."
4,Chainfire,"If you have enjoyed the previous books in this series,then you will enjoy this one.How can you not..it's part of the story.This book is the first in the Chainfire trilogy but is still part of the whole Sword Of Truth series and follows on seamlessly.I think that some people might be disappointed because this particular storyline does not reach a happy conclusive ending like in previous books of the series,it is after all a trilogy.Maybe the previous reviewer might not be so negative if Mr Goodkind had written the whole story in a 2000+ page book.I too,want to find out what happens next but I am willing to wait in eager anticipation for the next book.It's just as good as the others so if you have been reading the series,you'd be a mug for not continuing based on a bad review.This of course is just my opinion."
4,You'll have to enjoy the perspective to enjoy his books.,"I enjoy Ayn Rand's work and Objectivism. So these books and I get along very well for the most part. I anjoy the parrallels he creates. I am guilty of skimming at times. But I always got back and read it again.I wish Mr. Goodkind had retained the voice and the pace of the first books in the series (which is why I only gave it 4 out of 5). I always go back and read those again with pleasure. But I find it hard to relish in his latest works.My suggestions would be, finish writing the series from this point on the just the drama, action, romance and inventiveness his fans have come to expect. The write a companion the the series that lays down the Objectivist perspective and adds the things, in his passion and plead for common sense he feels compelled to add. I think that would be much more enjoyable."
2,"""Yes she is""....""No she isn't""","Since Terry Goodkind's first book I have been a fan. At the end of each book I felt full, satiated from a huge bowl of his creative talent. However, the soup is quite watery this time out. Like his last effort we are staring at thin again. ""Yes she is""....""No she isn't"" is what the first 55 chapters are all about. Maybe this was some attempt at producing a cliffhanger element to the story. I am not sure. What I am sure of is that it brought the books story line down to the level of a soap opera. Start this book on Chapter 56 and enjoy the beginning of the story and skip the drawn out angst of the previous chapters. Thankfully this book has glimpses of the Terry Goodkind fantasy world so many of us came to cherish in his earlier works. Still, I will never give up on this author because I feel his best is yet to come."
2,The series used to be good...,"As many other people have mentioned the book could be several hundred pages shorter by simply NOT repeating what happened in the previose 8 books so Maybe mention some key points in the first copule chapters to refesh memory and drop it.The first few books were good, but lately the whole series seems like Goodkind is trying to impart some grand morall truth onto the readers. It's WAY to preachy and anoying after a while. I found myself skipping paragraphs constantly in the past couple of books.Also ive notived that the characters often take many chapters to come to some 'grand realization' that was rediculously obvoise from the begining. Everyone (except for possibly Richard) is very lacking when it comes to intelligence.Im only sticking to the series becuase someone I know buys the books so im not wasting money and ive read so many I might as well finish it."
2,"Get On With It, Already","A friend assured me that Pillars of Creation was the only stinker in this series to date. He was wrong. This is - by far - the worst book I've read up to this point.A trilogy's first book isn't always the best. You lay out the rules, and set up the conflict. That's the way it goes. But the fact of the matter is that setting up the rules - and the conflict - didn't need to stretch on for 600+ paperback pages. Man, what a tedious book this was; if Richard wasn't reiterating his frustration in monologue, he was beating the same old dead horse with various characters.I have a bachelor's degree in philosophy, and hadn't really taken issue with Mr. Goodkind's thinking until this book. Zedd's ramblings regarding contradiction and faith are ridiculously juvenile, and Goodkind did a startlingly wonderful job of making a wise character turn in to a stupid fool.Here's to hoping Phantom isn't this burdensome."
2,"same plot, new twist","This would have been a great book 4 or 5, but I think were all tired now of having the Imperial Order trample all over everyone while Kahlen and Richard play hide and seek. Granted this is a new twist and perhaps the best one, yet still about the 5th or 6th book, if Im not mistaking, where Richard and Kahlen get separated and spend the entire book looking for one another, Either that or one is very sick or injured, and the entire book is focussed on trying to save the one whos injured or sick.I don't neccisarily need to see the series end right away, but I atleast want to see an entire book of Richard, Kahlan, and their army strike a major blow to the order and give the reader some hope. I don't think that even if goodkind ended the series right away, that theres much to save anymore.Oh yes, Goodkind still has a perfect record in finding ways to keep an incredibly powerful wizard from using any (or very little) magic in his books (9-0)"
2,Kahlan's missing again...,"Yaaawn...Kahlan is missing, Richard must hunt for her, discovers a new magic along the way, blah, blah, blah...This is repetitive to the point of insulting. This theme has been repeated over and over throughout this series, which I was a huge fan of for the first several books.Goodkind is a very talented storyteller, but he's run this one to the ground. My advice Terry, is to move on. Maybe write a story about a evil wizard attempting to take over the world using rings of power. That story line has more originality left in it that The Sword of Truth does at this point."
3,"Decent, but not terrific","I just finished the book, and I'm a bit disappointed. The story itself is very good, and I can't wait until the next book in the series is released, but Mr. Goodkind rambled on just a bit to much at the begining of the book.The characters have turned into rambling fools in some instances, and it was beyond annoying having to plow my way through their never-ending babbling. What should have only taken them a paragraph or two to say, instead took seven or eight. They said the same thing, over and over. If I hadn't already been a huge fan of the series, I never would have gotten through the first three chapters. But....I'm glad I did force my way through, because in the end I was thrilled with the story itself. Although it was a bit cruel of Mr. Goodkind to leave us dangling as he did - talk about anticipation! All in all, I would say read the book, just be aware that although it starts out hard to plow through, the finish makes it all worthwile."
1,Forewarned is forearmed,"I had been anxiously awaiting this release but a little voice inside me told me to put my credit card back in my wallet and save the $25.00!!! I am glad that I did..... I am done with this series. Thanks for warning me about this fiasco!Hopefully, Terry can redeem himself!"
2,"We love you Terry, but come on","I have followed this series from the beginning, and I love the message he is sending with each book. I love the images he paints and all the characters. This book was fun the whole way through, but when I got to the last 50 pages, I was wondering how he was going to wrap up the complications. The answer was a real let down. He just needed another 50 pages and it would have been great. At least he could have solved ONE of the three major problems. He just left us all hanging for two more years before he writes another one. I don't mind waiting, but I expect a book to have some sort of goal reached at the end. Kinda like the feeling when you saw LOTR1 in the theater for the first time and the ending sucked, but the movie was way too good to be mad about it."
5,Story telling at its best,"Chainfire is an excellent book. Terry Goodkind has mastered the art of bringing the reader into the story. Chainfire (like all of his novels) shows us all just how important being an individual actual is. In Chainfire Terry Goodkind masterfully guides us through the Sword of Truth world with the reader asking a very important question - who is Kahlen? We see how one individual effects the world.The emotional journey Terry takes you on is extreme. From sheer joy to unbelievable saddness to rightous anger to deep fear, Terry Goodkind gives you all.His characters are so believable that you don't think of them as characters in a novel but think of them as your friends.Terry Goodkind has two more novels to go in this series and we can see that he is setting them up to be excellent, awe-inspiring novels.The philosophy in his novels, that have been there from book one, is brilliantly and flawlessly depicted.In short, Terry Goodkind's novels make you want to live."
2,Here we go again,"How many times can you wear out the same story line. Kahlan lost, Kahlan found, Kahlan lost again, Kahlan found again. Or Richard lost, Richard found, ohp...Richard lost again, Richard found again. Goodkind has run out of ideas. He should put the Sword of Truth series down and move on to something fresh."
3,A too long yarn.,"I have followed the Sword of Truth from the beginning.Alas, book number 9, Chainfire,is the last one for me.The author is needlessly and endlessly repating himself and indoing so he is destroying his own book.The story needed only one third of the pages he used."
3,Verbose!,"I have absolutely loved the previous 8 books (9 including the prequel) of this series, but was sorely dissapointed that Goodkind seems to have taken a page from Jordyn's ""how to"" book and decided to stretch this story a few hundred pages too long. Normally I enjoy his indept explainations of how Richard reasons out the challenges he comes across and the wonderful interations between characters, but I found myself skipping ahead. There is only so many times you can read ""wait, I don't understand, explain it again"". Yes, I understand there is a problem, no one else believes you, just get on with it man!However, the book did manage to pick up towards the end, which leads me to hope that this book served a purpose in setting up a very interesting book 10. Let's hope that is so!"
1,"Preachy, repetitive and incomplete","Just confirming the opinion of several other reviewers. The book is preachy (Ayn Rand covered this material years ago), excessively long for the plot (too much time sent reintroducing what happened in previous books) and doesn't appear to end at a complete point in the story. I really enjoyed the first few books in the series but the last few have not been satisfying."
3,Where's the rest of the story?,"""Get on with it!"" as one character said to another as yet another endless restating of the facts takes place. You have to admire Goodkind's writing skills -- he can take one sentence and spin it into 4 pages.And Where's the rest of this story? At least, in the past, you could count on Goodkind to tell a self-contained story, one that at least resolved the main issue of that particular book, but we're left hanging at the end of this one.Is it true there are only 2 more books to go? Well, at least an end is in sight (hey, Mr. Jordan, you paying attention?)This could have been an incredible 5-book series -- the best ever, but Goodkind was no doubt told to stretch it out to make more money. . .so now we have a mediocre series where readers skip over vast numbers of pages in a book (without missing a thing,) waiting for the final story.Wizards First Rule was just amazing - let's hope the last two books measure up."
3,I feel used,"Pretty much nothing was accomplished in this book! Why call Richard a Wizard? He hasn't used any magic in, how many books? Its either stolen, there are various bad things waiting to pounce if he uses it, he's forgotten he has it, someone he loves will be harmed if he does, a piece of jewelry stops him from using it.......blah blah. With all the powers stacked against them, it might be nice if all the powerful good guys weren't alway hobbled by this and that so they can't fight back. All we get are hundreds of pages about how bad things are getting. OK, WE GOT IT! THINGS ARE BLEAK! I think ol'Terry is just stretching this out to sell more books. Ooops we lost something important, there we found it again. Ooops someone got kidnapped again, then they escape. Now let's waste a dozen or two pages on a philosophy lesson. It all ends back where we started. If this wasn't the next to last book, I'd be done. This is telling a five or six book story in eleven books."
3,Maddening,"I have greatly enjoyed many of the other books in this series, particularly the first. And I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading the next couple. The story continues to be interesting.Yet ...This book would have been greatly improved had Mr Goodkind done a couple things:- refrained from beating us over the head with his ""value of life"" theme. I started wishing I could blank out the parts of the book where he gives the same same old speech the 20th time. Or the 30th. Or the 40th ... Once would have been quite enough, thank you - twice if he was feeling self-indulgent.- had not revisited the plots of the previous books as much. A little is helpful, but I started to feel as if I was living in a time warp.It is annoying to enjoy a book enough to continue reading it while all the time wanting to attack the permissive editor with a freshly-sharpened pencil."
3,I dunno...,"I was a rabid T. Goodkind fan through TEmple of the Winds, but after that the story just seemed to run out of gas. This latest one, #9, in spite of the recap, has some of the old writing style I liked so much before, then again it started to drag after awhile. Like everybody else, I'm hoping TG will breathe some new life into the last 2 in the series,"
3,wordy,"I want to say first I really love Goodkind. However with this book he has fallen prey to what so many series writers do, the need to recap too much from past books into the current book. The result here is way too much conversation and not nearly enough action. You read and read and read and NOTHING happens! When you finally think something is going to happen it's over in like 2 pages, no big deal. Even Cara's adventure is a small letdown because everything just goes back to words afterwards. However the last part of the book, WOW! I was so hooked-finally. But then bam! it was over. No more pages!I finally get really vested in the story and it's over. Bottom line-this book wasn't worth waiting for the ending. I will have to really think before buying the next hardcover in the series.I know I won't be keeping this one. it's worth 9.00 credit at the bookstore. I really hope the next book jumps back to the old standards.I hate to see the series just fizzle out."
3,Losing his touch,"I've been a fan of TG's works since the very beginning, and I have thoroughly enjoyed every last book. However, ""Chainfire"" left me in tears.. of boredom. It had a great opening but around pages 250-500 I found myself STRUGGLING to get through it. I don't remember his books being so- preachy? I felt like I was rereading the same thing over and over. Near the end it picked up a bit, perhaps because I was just so excited to be done with it? I can't say I won't finish this series because I am still very fond of the characters and storyline, and I feel I've come to far to say, ""screw it!"" So I have picked up ""Phantom,"" and I plan on hopefully reading this series conclusion with the ""Confessor."" At least one can hope that it's the end. I give the book a 3 out of 5 because however boring the middle of the book was..the beginning and end had me going, ""woah!"""
4,The third best in the series,"First of all, I can not imagine anyone reading this book withput first having read the other 8 books in the series. If you would however, Goodkind has made it possible to understand the plot by telling what happened in the previous books every now and then. To me, who have read all the other books, that is a total waste of space. I ignore those passages.Secondly, some passages in the book are quite lenghty and you have an urge to progress on to the really exciting parts. But in fact, that is why the book is so good. Because the plot is still brilliant and you can not wait to see what will happen to our beloved characters. I am SO interested in this world of his and I have to know how everyting is going to turn out in the end.I feel a great sympathy with Richard Cypher in this book, and I also think Goodkind made a good job of letting us see him closer to despair than ever before."
1,not worth buying,"Im tired of always hearing the same thing in may different ways. He needs to get on with the story. If you want to to read great books, get books by David Gemmell."
2,How can a great story disappoint so...,"I came to write a detailed, critical review of Chainfire only to find so many others expressing my exact sentiments. Great storyline, great characters, but too much rehash, too much philosophy, too much (I hate to say it) ""fill"" for too little advancement of the story. One other reader beat me to the punch: ""Unfortunately, other than rehashing what I've ALREADY read in his other books, not much happened. I especially felt cheated in the end, which I won't ruin, but it felt like half a book.""As other reviewers have commented, I will continue to read the series to conclusion (if it ever has one); but I am disappointed in the author for being so unwilling to move along. I find myself skipping more and more rehashed prose until I find something actually happening. I must admit that I have started getting the latest release of this series from the library rather than purchasing it. And I love building my library of books that I own!"
4,One reader's view,"I have been reading SOT for several years now but haven't paid much attention to the series in the past two. Reading Chainfire made me go back and restart the series and befriend all the great characters I remember. Many people have grown tired of all the ""preaching"" in the last few books, and I sympathize. Goodkind is very good at occasionally beating a dead horse- he explains his views (and his apparent idolizing of Ayn Rand)on his website. However, at the heart of the books are amazing characters and a plotline that is rather staggering in scope. With such a large amount of ground to cover, it can be easy and sometimes necessary to slow the action and firm up your ground before heading on with your story. With a little redundancy, Chainfire has reignited the story- pun intended :). I am really looking forward to the next two books. The B of O (trying not to spoil) made a terrific beginning... it's going to be rather interesting to see how they work in the end."
2,What happened?,"Enough has been said about how Goodkind's objectivist preaching detracts from the storytelling. My main concern is that the writing itself was just bad. Even when he was carrying forth the plot and not his sermons, the characters felt like badly drawn caricatures of themselves. Their dialogue was forced and out of character, getting downright insipid at times. Their actions were completely out of joint with their character. New characters were thrown in seemingly at random and did not advance the story. It almost makes me wonder if he got a new editor who had not read any of the other books.All in all, I hope that Goodkind will return to the formula that made his previous books great (yes, I liked Pillars, Faith and Naked Empire)."
2,Somehow Richard Rahl became God,"This is a problem with all the long fantasy novels (except Tolkien and George RR Martin) that I wish authors could find a way around. They take a person from humble beginnings and build him up, give him magical type ability. Then this character that you can relate to is turned into this superman or demigogue in this case. I just kept getting the impression that Goodkind actually worships his character. All the prayers at the People's Palace and how it does all the characters so much good when they do it. Richard has turned infallible. I had hopes with the premise of everyone forgetting Kahlan in this book, but a complexity of character never really materialized.I just no longer relate to this character and it makes reading the preachy crap totally not worthwhile. This was much better than the book before it, but I wouldn't recommend either one."
4,Goodkind does it again.,"The first book in the SoT series I read was Faith of the Fallen, and I was blown away. I read the rest of the series beginning to end and was impressed by everything Mr. Goodkind was able to do. He is extremely original in each book, and he amazes me at every turn with his unique ability to make me fall in love with his characters. Chainfire is no exception to the rule. The amazing opening of the book will keep you entralled up to the very abrupt ending. This was definetly the first time Mr. Goodkind did not reslove at least some part of the plot, but the last three books are called ""the Chainfire trilogy."" Overall a very good read, and an excellent series."
2,A chore to read,"Wow. I was a huge Goodkind fan. I gave his books every chance. I liked his ideas and characters, and I liked how the story was progressing.Too bad the story isn't progressing.And too bad this story just sat there. God this was the worst. I coulnd't finish reading this book. I will have to go back and read it through thoroughly, but any book that takes me weeks to read is worth 2 stars. A book should hold your attention from page one. This one did not."
2,Could be half the pages!,"I love this series of books, but the last few are getting off track. Half of this book could have been left out. It was so repetitive I found myself skimming pages just trying to find something worth reading. Near the end the action starts and it was awesome. What really made me angry was that this was just a set up for the next 2 books.In past volumes there has always been a complete story (beginning, middle, end) and this book had the beginning and a little bit of the middle. Why did Terry Goodkind shy away from Kahlan's torture? This is what made his other books so enthralling. I suffered with Richard when he was with the Mord Sith and after this book I feel like I'm reading about characters instead of living along with them.NOTE TO TERRY GOODKIND: Leave behind the repetitive philosophy and get back to the actual story!!!!"
2,lower kindle price,"I can no longer justify spending nine dollars on the kindle version for 1/4 of a story and 3/4 recap of the previous 8 books. I read up to this one, but the last two or three have really been kind of a struggle to not just skip the explanation of the things the reader should know by now, if you pick up book 9 of a series you should have some idea of whats going on. Don't get me wrong, it's been a good series so far (if a bit preachy at times) but character development has slowed to a crawl and the stressed importance of ridding the world of the imperial order seems like a side project. I want to finish this story and I would probably spend another nine bucks if the story part of the next three books could be condensed into one. Goodkind needs to cut the exposition and the price and maybe I'll pick it back up."
1,Boring,"The reason I read a book is to enjoy it. Chainfire is a slow pace, nothing happening story. It should have been made a chapter or two in one of the other books. It's slow pace is dragged out to a thick book of many pages."
3,Prophecy Primer,"I enjoyed CHAINFIRE. It is what it is...a fun read. The stuff about how prophecy works drove me a bit batty and seemed forced. ""This subjugated convex triangle movement may cause a bit of a fulguration in current prophecy strings..."" This kind of thing does very little for me. I just made that one up out of thin air. However, Goodkind does what he does best and that is weave wonderful characters. I really enjoyed the book when not being given lessons about how magic or prophecy works. Worth the money."
1,Where's the beef?,"Like a majority of the reviews, this is no different. If you purchased this book, it is only because you have read the first 8, so I don't understand why Goodkind has to give us a recap of the first 8 books. While it wasn't as preachy as his last 3 books all it did was pretty much summarize all the previous books in the series. It's like watching one of your favorite TV show take the cheap way out by showing clips of previous episodes. I mean, no ones is going to start getting into the sword of truth starting with book 9.Goodkinds first 5 books were great, but his writing has slipped and I only borrow them from the library now."
3,"An upgrade from Naked Empire, but...","I love the series, and I like the characters. I think the author has definate talent. But for goodness sake, I was much happier reading the books when Richard Rahl was busy chopping off heads and fighting blade masters and epic battles. Now he spends the majority of the books running from this place to that and having long winded conversations that make it hard for me, as much as I love the series and the characters, to slog through the novels. The last two of his books have left me rather disappointed. And I'm getting frustrated by the mighty Lord Rahl's lack of progress in getting anything meaningful really accomplished.I am thankful that the annoying bleating goat was left out of this one though. It's a small consolation."
3,Interesting...,"I'm not sure how I feel about this book, and my 3 star rating reflects that. Is it great? Not even close. Is it bad? No, not really, and if you read the others, you may as well read this.This is a series that started out well, bogged down, and needs to finish with a bang. It may be that this is the beginning of a trilogy that will complete it, but time will tell.As much as I detest leaving characters that I feel I know well, there is a point where it should end. I think we've gotten there in this series."
2,More of the same,"Much like the last 2 books of the series, at one point you realize 100 pages and 11 chapters have gone by, and the characters have accomplished... almost nothing. I don't know whose idea it was to spend the first quarter of every book rehashing everything that happened in the rest of the series but it makes for mind-numbingly boring reading.It's not even philosophy. It's the endless pontification of the obvious."
2,22 CD's Long,"I am writing this as a first time reader/listener. The label on the CD case from the library obscured the fact that this was a series let alone a trilogy in a series. I'm glad I listen in the car as no objected to my frequent ""Enough already, get on with it"" outbursts. I stuck with it through 22 CD's to end with a let me down ending. It wasn't even a suspenseful ending, it actually left me a little angry. Maybe Terry is of the groupthink that if you repeat something often enough people will believe it. Only the other reviews telling about how different these rest were would get me to read any of the earlier books."
1,thank you,"I too gave up this seriees about 3 books ago... His writing progessivly got worse with each book, and he showed that after he broke from mimicing jordan he really didnt have much to write about... I thought to myself however, Maybe he regained his old story, I was close to picking up the book but thanks to these reviews i know sometimes you just have to let the dead stay dead...."
4,What is the deal with everyone?,ok so I know Mr. Goodkind is intending to write a fantasy but come on. He is an Amazing writer and you cant argue it. Stop saying it is to preachy be open minded. If it is to preachy for you stop reading them but don't give him a bad review just because he doesnt have the same thoughts on some things as you. Just acknowledge that this is a good book and it is full of suspense and action and desperate romace. Just Take it for what it is not for what you want it to be.
3,Still waiting,"If Mr. Goodkind can finish this series in my lifetime I will buy the rest of his books; until then I refuse to put money in his pocket. I learned my lesson with Robert Jordan, whose books I have traded in, and will not spend money on any more ""Neverending Stories""."
2,"Haven't read it yet, but I'll assume it's worth 2 stars","When I first started reading the Sword of Truth books, I liked them a lot, although they seemed like they were copying the Wheel of Time. From the reviews I've read here, it seems like that is still happening, in a way. Jordan's series fizzled in books 7 and 8, but then picked up again in 9 and 10. Likewise, PoC and NE sucked, but apparently Chainfire has a little more life to it. The only real difference is that Jordan doesn't spend half of each book preaching his political views with absolutely no subtlety whatsoever. I think I'm going to wait until the series is finished before reading any more of Goodkind's books.PS: To all you Jordan bashers out there, I thought this was supposed to be a review of Chainfire, not the Wheel of Time.PPS: People would be more inclined to pay attention to your reviews if you took the time to spellcheck."
2,Here we go again...,"I used to love the Terry Goodkind books - but then they started getting repeditive. Richard and Kahlan are going to live happily ever after... oh, wait, no they aren't! And the whole world is in terrible danger! And Richard is going to open people's eyes to goodness and the Value of Life with his Amazing lectures along the way!The ninth book, Chainfire? Only half a book. Stops abruptly at the end - most of the action will be in the next one. At least this book is a little less preachy than the other ones."
1,"Pure, unadulterated propaganda","This book reads like a treatise on enforcing the spread of democracy written by Paul Wolfowitz.Mr Goodkind, stick to the Fantasy genre please, stay away from politics.The fact that your first few novels were so enjoyable only makes this piece of garbage worse by comparison."
3,Chainfire,"You'll end up hating this book from the very start with Kahlan MIA.... Terry has writen out our favorite female of the series and has turned the world on its ear with everyone thinking Richard has lost all sense from a near-death experience. If you persevere through this book you finally make sence of what is happening and things pick up in the last few chapters... only to leave you at the worst cliff-hanger in the series! This book needs Phantom to be sold as a two pack as far as I am concerned, but it is still worth owning if you love the sword of truth series."
2,make the hurting STOP,"Well, what is left to say about Goodkind? He still claims that he doesn't write fantasy and that his books are about human interaction/etc. Sadly this latest in the SoT series doesn't measure up to his earlier works such as Wizards 1st which was at least a decent read. As is normal with Goodkind he rehashes a fairly stale plot with his same cardboard cutout and inane characters. This books is better than his last offering by far, but that isn't enough to get Goodkind out of the hole he has dug for himself.Goodkind continues however to offer bocks for the lite fantasy reader which seems to be his forte, those that like his style (or lack thereof) should continue to enjoy his series Those of us that just read Goodkind because we like to abuse ourselves after getting sucked in by a couple decent books at the beginning of the series will continue to suffer at the hands of a guy that is bringing new meaning to the term ""hack""."
4,Very Enjoyable,"This was not as good as some of the previous books, but was still a good story. The characters continue to evolve and become more interesting, even the antagonists. Very enjoyable and can't wait to read the next installment."
2,worse yet,the majority of the book seems to have been written for the sake of writting a book. skip the first few hundred pages and read the last one hundred. You'll save yourself some pain.
3,More of the same.,"This book is more of the same. However when it's Terry Goodkind it's high quality. This book does make you want to devote more time to it than you really should, as his always do. And the puzzle that is the basic storyline is an interesting one. It made me almost go back and read the last book just to remember more clearly what happened.The bottom line is this is a solid, readable book that is enjoyable. Jumping into the storyline this far in is a big mistake. Goodkind has his own style (and it's a bit wordy) and new readers would not want to chip their teeth on this tome. But it is a good continuation of the story nonetheless."
1,what a waste of time...,"As a Goodkind fan for over ten years, I keep buying his latest book with such hope - only to be extremely disappointed, again and again... Chainfire is no exception.Lousy, boring, way toooooooo long and the ending wasn't an ending (imho) since it concluded as if he said ""that's it, I'm through writing for today"" - and could have happened 300 pages earlier.<sigh> to say I was disappointed (once again) is an understatement."
1,Just say NO!!!,"Terry Goodkind YOU WILL NEVER NEVER NEVER GET ANOTHER DIME FROM ME!!! I have waited for the last few books for Richard to become this gifted so called wizard, but NO he is just riding off of the coat tales of everyone else. The women in his life are the true hero's not to mention his grandfather Zed!!! I was yawning the yawn that really was a yawn. I wanted to rate this a big fat ""0"", but it wouldn't let me. By the way I totally used to love the story line and the characters, my sister-in-law and my self were huge fans. She is done too!!"
3,"Ok, but not much more","I read this book, and I enjoyed it, however it was not as good as some of the others in the series. I have gotten bored of the constant ""flash backs"" I do not understand why there can't be a ""the story so far"" summary for people who have not read the previous books, so I find myself thumbing through many pages because I already know what happened in the past. Mr. Goodkind also seems to ""dumb his characters down"" (they get brain cramps). He seemed to make several character act out of character in this book, which made sense considering what the story was trying to demonstrate.I really enjoy the series. I like how it is written (except the flash backs). I like the characters, and I like that how it is creative."
1,Where is the story???,Don't bother with this book. Every place Richard went he ran into more characters and the whole point of the story had to be explained in painful detail to the new characters. I have read the whole series and this was one of the worst. Even a big important battle scene is barely talked about so they could focus on repeating Richards feelings to someone new... blegh!
2,Too long-winded and repetitive,"This is a book that could be one-third the length and become a better product. If I had not enjoyed the first few books in the series so much I would not have even finished this one. I love the characters and want to see this series to a completion, but I'm so tired of the long-winded dissertations and telling the same thought in so many different ways. The back and forth discussions of why something could or could not happen often last several pages when they could be done better with three or four sentences. This being said, I love the series and hope that the finish comes back to its roots."
2,A Fast Read,"Chainfire is a fast read because of the redundant, repetitive and boring passages that can be skipped to get at the heart of the story. In Chainfire Richard Rahl reaches a lowpoint--as must all heroic figures--and his closest friends lose confidence in him. It appears that characters are congregating and moving together as the end of the series looms on the horizon. In Chainfire, travelling with Cara and Nicci, Richard visits Shota the witch woman, then he travels to the Wizards Keep to meet with Zedd where they are joined by Ann the secret Prelate, and Nathan Rahl the prophet. Finally, he travels to D'Hara, to the People's Palace, and back again to Adindryl. So, a lot of territory is covered, many passages are repetitive, but it feels as though the characters are moving together to present a united front in the final battle to come."
3,sigh. slightly better than the same old (ie new) junk,"i think everyone, goodkind fans and not, agrees that he has lost the magic of ""wizards first rule."" that book was an awesome start to the series. simply awesome. the next 2 were good. then the 4th was ok. then it went way downhill. with this 9th book, comparing it to the first, goodkinds writing style has really gone down the tubes. honestly. not just the content, but the style itself has dramatically changed. its very immature and didactic. i think goodkind has become a deadline writer and has completely lost the essence of what made the first books so great. this book is somewhat better than the last 2, as its not so obviously preachy, but its still there.that said, i keep buying the dang books. i have them all in hardcover. and i keep crossing my fingers and hoping that we will someday see the genius that was in ""wizards first rule"" once again. but im not holding my breath."
2,Check it out from the Library,"I found myself skipping through this book because most of it is just filler. Unless you want to have the whole collection on your shelf, save your money and check it out from the library.Richard gets injured, Nicci saves him, everyone forgets aboutKahlan, Richard is the only one who remembers Kahlan, No one believes Richard, Richard goes looking for Kahlan. That was pretty much it! The most promising new addition to the sword world are a tribe of dreamcasters but they get pushed aside towards the end when it seems like the author is just trying to wrap things up and end the book."
5,All Fired UP!!,"Man, I have read all of Terry Goodkind's novels, and the last couple have really been solid and hugely entertaining fantasy epic reading.The first two or three of this series are the best, but the last couple have definately improved from his so-called 'slump' that I and the large majority of this writers readers seem to agree on.But Chainfire never lets up. Goodkind's storylines and characters is second to none. Never boring, and always captivating, CHAINFIRE is a rip-roaring adventure with tons of intrigue that is way above and beyond most fantasy writers out there today. I look forward to seeing how Richard finds Kahlan.A fantastic fantasy novel."
1,"Should have stopped with ""Faith of the Fallen""","I don't read to be preached to on the philosophy of free will, love, or prophecy. The story gets completely lost. I won't finish this one and I won't buy the other one until it hits the $2.00 table. ANd only to finish the collection"
2,For the love of god finish the damned series,"To be honest, I stopped reading this series after I finished Book 8 Naked Empire. At that point I became fed up with reading the same story line over and over again. This series has been by far my favorite series if I exclude the last 3 or 4 books. Wizard's rule and Faith of the Fallen were two of his best, I think. Beyond that he begins to drop many of the great character interactions and quirks and starts becoming too philosophical and too wordy. I grew weary of the 3 page long explanations that could have been dealt with satisfyingly in 2 or 3 sentences, and I grew weary of Richard being an idiot and getting captured all the time, and finding some miraculous way out of it that somehow defines his new abilities. A word of advice to Mr. Goodkind; You should have ended this series 4 books ago, would you just end it already. Start a new series with new characters and I will read it."
1,Following Robert Jordan down the garden path,"I was so very happy to yet again be invited to feast at the table of Terry Goodkind. He had never before failed to fill me with delight. Imagine my disappointment when all he served this time was a few aperitifs, and long reminiscences of his previous endeavors.Terry has either fallen for the old tell-the-past-history-so-the-reviewers-know-what's-happening routine, or he has simply lost his passion for writing. This seems to happen to many series writers when they become too successful. Waiting for the next ""Eye of the World"" installment? Don't hold your breath. The ""Explorer"" series? Is C.J. still alive? The Sword of Truth series seems to be destined for the same purgatory. (...)Don't buy the book, you will only be disappointed. Terry says on prophets-inc.com that you need to ""savor"" the book, not rush through it. He also says it will be at least a year before the next installment. Wait for it, hope for it, and read this book as a prequel to it."
1,This is not fantasy. This is propaganda.,"It was simply to frustrating a read, bear in mind that I've read all the 8 other books. Now I didn't mind Mr. Goodkind dabbling with philosophy in Faith of the Fallen, as long as it supported the plot.Sadly this book is philosophical propaganda disguised as a fantasy book. The universe being used as a vehicle to prove Mr. Goodkind's pseudo intellectual philosophies.A character like Richard simply disgusts me now. From being a boy with strong beliefs, he has been molded into a righteous tyrant, who enforces his beliefs upon everybody and everything. Its sad to see.No. I really recommend anyone to stay clear of this book, its not worth the read. Its an insult to the reader, with endless monotonies and weak philosophy."
3,Better but not great,"As many other reviewers have noted, this book is a step up from ""The Naked Empire"", but that's not saying much. I think Goodkind is a talented writer that got *really* full of himself - and he hasn't recovered completely; ""Chainfire"" is at its heart a book about a man who has to convince the entire world that they're wrong and he's right. Again, the situation is contrived so that this is actually the way things are, just like it was with the absurdly oversimplified portrayal of peace activists in Naked Empire. I agree with Goodkind that there are such things as moral absolutes, but it does nothing to strengthen his philosophical case to bludgeon readers over the head with it.I'll finish the series because it had good momentum at the beginning and I know Goodkind is capable of writing good fantasy - his contempt for the genre and its fans, evident in interviews with him, notwithstanding."
3,Starting to wear thin,"While I still enjoy this series, the whole ""Richard and Kahlan get separated"" theme is wearing thin. Jagang needs to be dealt with, everyone needs to live happily ever after, and Terry Goodkind needs to start another series.He gives us pretty believable characters, but could use a page from George RR Martin in that respect. This is supposed to be an ""epic"" tale, but while I still care what happens to the characters for the most part, I'm starting to get bored by some of the stuff that happens to them.It seems to be the same set of circumstances over and over, Richard and Kahlan get separated, Richard faces some new magic he's never seen before, and figures out how to overcome it while everyone else thinks he's on the wrong track.Let's try something new, hmmm?"
5,Really cute,Much cuter in person than the photo and it fits well staying on my head without pins! This is also a great vender I have used many times without a single problem.
1,Ick!,"This is one book I want to forget I ever spent good money on, or invested time in reading. How did this author get published? Who told her that so-called 'mystic ponies' belonged in Regency romances? And worst of all, didn't her editor tell her she'd got so much plain wrong!This book reads like it was written by an amateur with no notion of the habits, customs and rigid social structures of Regency times, let alone simple inheritance law. The characterisations are all over the place, and overall the book is just terrible.I can't understand how this book got good ratings; maybe some of us are more fussy about accuracy, realism and consistent characterisation in our reading than others."
1,Eeewww!,"This has to be the most nauseating, unbelievably bad book I have ever read. Totally unconvincing plot, unlikeable and incredible characters and to add insult to injury, the most stupid, insulting plot devices I have ever come across. This book had no redeeming features whatsoever.A duke falling in love with, and marrying, the illegitimate granddaughter of a witch? The illegitimate son of an earl inheriting his title? 'Mystic' bloody ponies? I wanted to be sick.The saddest thing of all is that Nadine Miller's first book, 'The Duke's Dilemma', was just so good that I was really interested in reading more of her work. But having read this and 'The Unlikely Angel,' I'm almost inclined to doubt that they were written by the same person.Appalling. Truly abysmal. And as for research - well, it looks to me as if Miller has never heard of the concept."
1,This is the 4th Edition,I may have been foolish and overlooked but a precaution. This is the 4th edition while I needed the 6th so take note of my mistake.
2,nequia,"In a bold move this book is written as an epic poem, however, readers might not be ready for this type of style. It befuddles the story. An amnesiac man is summoned onto an epic quest by a white stallion. He journey's through levels of hell, battle monsters of legend to rescue being who become his companions. In the end, when they have all been retrieved, he regains his memory and learns the mystery of his past.However, this is a beautiful book to display if you collect books."
5,Most authentic Chinese cookbook you can find in English,"I found this cookbook on a clearance rack at a Ross store in 2008 for $6.99. One of the best purchases I have ever made. I am half Chinese and grew up with almost all of the recipes listed in the book. It is beautifully illustrated , which motivates me a little more to make my dishes look good! I&#699;ve had a lot of Chinese cookbooks growing up, but I&#699;d say this book has most of my childhood favorites. I don&#699;t speak or read enough Chinese to make good use of the cookbooks my parents have. Easy to read, the formatting is great and reads very well. Now that I&#699;m grown, I&#699;ve made my favorite dishes for my spouse and child. This cookbook has allowed me to continue family traditions and teach my child about our heritage :)"
2,aw shucks,"I've always dug John Hammond on previous albums. Recently I heard him ""live in the studio"" on NPR and he sounded so good--down home vocals (not pushing too hard)and yowza cutting edge guitar--that I rushed out to get this album, thinking it was his latest and would capture what I had just heard. Boy was I disappointed. This release is canned and kind of dull, more like background blues (if there is such a thing) than in your face honest to goodness blues. Not laid back, just plain old blah. I'm still a fan but I'm going to trade this one in."
5,Scenic National Parks - Grand Canyon,This is a breathtaking documentary showing the true colors of the Grand Canyon! You will not regret adding this beautiful documentary to your BluRay collection.
1,Don't waste your money--it doesn't play,"I tried two copies of this disk--neither plays in my brand-new Samsung BD-1600 Blu-Ray player, which plays all the other Blu-Ray disks I've put into it. Only the menu plays--you can't get past it, and eventually the player locks up and has to be powered down to get the disk out. Save you money and buy another video on the Grand Canyon."
2,tennesseecurt,Quality could have been much better. There is a lot more to see and experience than what is seen here.
1,Biggest wast of time and money.,Any woman who has endometriosis has found all of this information out for herself just by browsing the internet. No new information here and very little respect or attention is paid to diet remedies - which are ESSENTIAL to managing your endometriosis symptoms. Save your money - or spend it on an endometriosis diet book.
4,Westley Can Talk Your Ear Off!,"While this film did not break any box office record, the dialog that is laid down by Westley Snipes is worth viewing again. In the original screening, the fast paced rapid delivery was as fast as the bullets speeding from the guns used in the film. Accordingly, a lot of the dialog and humor is missed. To watch it again is to listen and hear all of the nuances of that dialog and the terrific action sounds. The DVD is has one of the best fully active surround mode sounds"
4,Good Action,"This movie combines ""Brave New World"" with Sylvester Stallone's typical action. Combine that with it's great one-liners, it a good bet."
4,Snipes is a great bad guy,"The plot is not new but it is a fun ride. Snipes plays one of my favorite movie bad guys in this one. He is great. Stallone is good but to me, Snipes steals the show. END"
3,Taco Bell - Pizza Hut issue...,"Hi... I don't know if you already fuund a solutions about this issue. I just found out why!This DVD was probably made from the international edition which was digitally modified to remove Taco Bell and insert Pizza Hut. The reason is the following: to keep the effectiveness of the product placement operation.In simple words, Taco bell was not very famous abroad and was replaced in the international edition with Pizza Hut in video and audio presence too.Of course they are brands of the same gruop (Pepsi): it was something coordinated with the producer and the corporate involved.I hope this will help you...Sorry about my english language... I'm italian and I wrote this quickly!Bye!Zo"
5,I love this movie!,"Wow, I love this movie! I watched it over and over again and never got tired of watching it. This movie is a classic now. I loved watching Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes, and Sandra Bullock. All went on and had great film careers after this movie too. I really recommend this movie whoever love action fighting, great fighting, and there's some romance in there too. ha ha"
4,Post modern of todays standerds.,Snipes plays a the best role in the whole movie. The psycho with pride. Sallone's character does make the movie complete. Overall Demolition man is a classic stylish scify action movie but the scenery is a little dated for a futuristic movie.
5,Corny,"Very corny! Totally a 'B' movie, but got to have it in your collection. Sandra Bullock and Benjamin Bratt are so... cool."
3,An original but average film,The movie could have been far better if Sly Stallone had not have played the starring role. Surely there were far better younger actors out there who could have contributed a better performance. Sandra Bullock and Wesley Snipes rescue the movie and take into the 'average and watch-able' category. If you see the movie look out for the comical part where Sly and Wesley Snipes have a punch-up. I get the impression that the director was trying to make it look like a Rocky Movie!
3,Ahh... Sly really knows how to make an action flick.,"This movie is nothing but fun. It didn't win any awards and.. I suppose it didn't really deserve any. BUT, the action is great! The one liners are great. Some of the situations this movie brings about are great. The entertainment value of this movie is VERY HIGH. If you like Sly or action movies.... it is a MUST SEE."
3,Technicals,"Good movie but, DO NOT buy this DVD! The audio commentary on the widescreen side coomes on automatically and won't shut off. On the fullscreen side, you can watch it with no problem. But, when you turn on the audio commentary, it won't shut off."
4,Take out your Aggression,"The only reason I own this is for the times I want to see a great kick b*&t sequence, and Wesly Snipes definitely provides several!"
4,100 times watched & still going,"I've seen this movie at least a hundred times and it keeps getting better. While the story line was nothing beyond the usual action film gun totting good guy (Stallone) vs. evil psycotic bad guy (Snipes) the social and technological concepts covered in this film really make a person think what could be accomplished & avoided in creating a more peaceful society.It would be interesting to see a prequel movie or book based on the forming of San Angelas and characters like Chief Erl, Mayor-Gov Raymond Cocto and Warden William Smithers, but I don't think this movie did well enough at the box office for this to become a reality.If you are into Stallone films this may not be his best one, but if you are into Utopian Ideals of future societies then this is the movie for you."
4,I may not know art but I know what I like,"Yes, the movie is, as of this writing, anachronistic. Supposedly, the last MDK in Los Angeles was last year, et al. But it is an enjoyable movie with recognizable actors. And how cute as a button is/was Sandra Bullock! I could watch this movie over and over again.Having seen this movie mostly on broadcast TV and on Amazon Instant Video, watching the Blu-ray version was like watching it for the first time. So sharp and clear! I was finally able to see the continuity error of Wesley Snipes eye color switch back and forth.Unfortunately, not much in the way of extra features and no BD Live content."
4,We're police officers! We're not trained to handle this kinda violence!!,"For its time, this movie was rather innovative. If you recall the late 80s and early 90s, most of the action movies of the time assumed that the world would be completely dystopic by the 21st century. (SEE ALSO Robocop, Predator 2, at least half of the movies made by Schwarzennegger...)Demolition Man defies this by swinging the pendulum completely the opposite direction and pitting classic action archetypes against each other in a utopic future setting instead of the prosaic dystopic one.Some disbelief suspension is necessary to enjoy this. There's plenty of overacting and the whole movie's rather campy. You'll either love it or hate it. Most people I've talked to love it."
4,Don't mess with a Demolitionary Man...,No wait!?! I alway get that song title mixed up with The Eurthymics 'Missionary Man'...I also got this DVD mixed up with one with a commentary and theatrical trailer!!Which was missing from my one purchased in New Zealand. South Pacific buyers BEWARE when buying locally!!Read what is offered on the back not what is listed on the inside!! Same packaging - Different DVD...And for the first time in all my viewings of this action favourite - did I hear 'Pizza Hut' dubbed over Stallones obvious visual pronunciation of 'Taco Bell'!!....Speaking of yummies!?! Did Ms Bullock ...ever look so appealing in a movie!?!?! Wow!! Stallone was great!! Funny and charming as ever... Definitely one of his best!! Even the kid selling it to me had to smile and comment accordinly... 'Great movie!!'Wesley Snipes was hialarious!!I loved this film from 'wo to go'... only the other way round - cos we all know ' go' comes first and 'wo' comes at the end... Which is now!! :-)
3,Movies for guys,Husband enjoyed it. Not my genre of movies but notBad. He will have another keeper in his collection. Thanks
5,Best Sly Stalone Movie,"This movie is a surprise for it campy wit. I has action and adventure plus it's just plain fun. Wesley Snipes is hillarious and this is one of the first places where you will see Sandra Bullock. If you are expecting Rambo, you won't like this one."
3,barely mediocre,"This is the only Sylvester Stallone movie I ever saw in its entirety, and that was because I was stuck on a bus trip between Chengdu and Chongking. It is pure formula junk, with not a jot of originality or anything that rises about banal violence, simplistic good guys and bad guys, and spectacular effects. I would not recommend this to anyone who wants more than the crudest, most brainless Hollywood entertainment, but then, that is why I have avoided Stallone films."
2,Good Movie? Stop Lying!,"... To Sly's credit this movie wasn't that bad but the only thing it's got going for it is Snipes one liner's, fighting and Bullock's good looks. Not much to work with folks!"
2,"Demolition Man, starring: Barbequed Pork?--no, Stallone","Sylvester Stallone slurs his way through another explosion-encased attempt at a movie. Good God, I'm sorry--but deep down, you know that's how it goes. I just feel sorry for the guy who has to clean up the bullet blanks at the end of each take (and Stallone's acting coach--ZING!).Wesley Snipes is in this too as a flamboyant, clown-like gangster with bullets and guns and the intention of wearing parachute pants...that's how his character acts. But hey, it was the 80's version of the future, so if you didn't have parachute pants or metal shoulder pads, you were pretty much a loser.I think there is a woman in this to, but it was hard to tell through all of the gun smoke.Stallone would be at the bottom of my list if it wasn't for people like Steven Segal and (most of all) Jean-Claude Van Damme. Human meatloaf....GOD!"
2,the comedy was the best touch,"the whole fact that the future was changed into a cheesy ""be well"" type enviorment really was pretty stupid.joel siegel(critic off of good mourning america)said it was the best sci-fi movie since T2.was he high!!! what really pissed me off though was the great earthquake the allegidly wiped out the fast food chain industry, i couldn't handle this. dont get me wrong i like taco bell and all, but i couldn't live without my checkers fries."
3,"""Demoliton Man"" Review","Sylvester Stallone is rogue cop John Spartan, a law enforcement officer from the 90's who is ""thawed out"" in the year 2032 to track down his arch-nemesis Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes). One-liners and bullets fly at break-neck pace as Stallone and Snipes punch, kick, and shoot their way into a ""violence-free"" future. Sandra Bullock also shows up as Sly's new partner but her perfomance is easily overshadowed by the hilarious Denis Leary who pops up in the film's third act. There hasn't been an action movie this enjoyably cheesy since Tango & Cash. The DVD edition offers a commentary track and a trailer."
4,about the movie demolition man......,The story is basically about to get rid of wesney snipes as he is the person that caused many death (if I am not wrong) after syvester stallone was released from 'frozen' prison so some so called bad deeds. There are many good numbers of explosion and gun fire exchanges but what makes it a good laughing joke is that the police whom are sci fiction persnnel in this movie reacted in a 13 dots character. It is still a good recommendation to those whom prefer this genre of movie/film afterall. Enjoy....
3,Good fun but not more,One of the few Stallone movies I like. He's fun to watch in this one and Sandra Bullock adds her naive sweetness to it. The movie has no depth but allows some entertaining glimpses into the future. Easy entertainment!
2,"Fun Movie, Poor Quality DVD","I have an old copy of this movie that I taped off HBO several years back and this DVD has more picture quality problems that the tape. Random spots, flashes, and obvious pixelation in several spots. Maybe it will look better if I'm not watching it on my computer....no such luck.Buyer beware, wait for a rerelease of this one even it it is 3 times more expensive or buy it locally so you can exchange it for another copy. Good Luck"
2,Good Movie Bad Disk Design,"I like this movie, but when I got the disk I hated it. It was one of those disks where they recorded on both sides. So both sides are vulnerable to damage. What made it even worse is the wide-screen side starts automatically with the Directors commentary turned on and there seems to be no way to turn it off.Finally I found it under the Languages menu option, which is NOT where it should be. Now to turn it off you have to select English from the first column of options, which then causes the subtitles to be turned on. So now you have to go back to the same menu, Languages, and this time move to the second column, subtitles, and select off. What a total pain!This is a very poorly designed disk!!!"
4,A look into our future?,"Great movie that goes beyond the post-apocolyptic future that many action movies diverted us into. If you can use the seashells, let the rest of us know so we can be prepared."
4,Dependable Action,"Sandra Bullock kills every movie she's ever in, so that is my reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. She really just gets on my nerves. The story has been talked about already, but I will say that some of the ideas presented were as interesting as the action itself. For instance, in the car they listen to the most popular radio station in town which is really just commercial jingles, getting the public to sing along about products being sold. Scary to think we are halfway to that reality as it is. This movie is full of useless one-liners that almost every american action film is required to have. They aren't as annoying as arnold's movies, and the delivery is pretty funny so it isn't too bad. The action scenes are clearly the standout moments, the one in the museum being the best in the film. Definitely worth seeing, i picked it up on vhs for 2 bucks at a used record store, can't beat that."
5,Everybody sing the Armour hot dogs jingle!,"This is a fan-freakin'-tastic sci-fi about a futuristic fascist government ruled by an evil despot ""Big Brother"" who recruits a violent gang leader from the 20th century to assassinate the leader of the resistance who lives underground where the despot cannot monitor him. The problem is that the despot cannot control the gangster who wreaks even more havok now than he did in the past. The police decide to recruit a tough 20th century cop to go after the 20th century gangster, but the cop has a hard time fitting in and following the ludicrous laws of the future. The action and the humor get really good from there."
4,regoin 4 reveiw,"This is certinly a great action movie. Ive alyways liked this film. However the regioun 4 version does not come with the trailers or commentary, it only has the movie in wide screen and that is it!One thing I did notice while watching this movie was they have dubbed the voices in some areas of the film with new dialogs! The most commenly known one i picked up on was in the original version i had on VHS it was ""Tacho Bell"" that was the product placment resteraunt they attended dinner in! But in this movie its been changed to ""Pizza Hut""! I'm not sure why, but you can tell by the ways the lips move that there saying ""Tacho Bell"" and ""Burrito"" and sounds a bit funny when they say ""Pizza Hut!""Stilla great movie ,well worth watchign if your into blow em up action movies!"
3,A Mixed Bag,"I am no connoisseur of jazz. I like the pure sound of Ella FItzgerald, and I bought this CD because I wanted to hear her sing some of my favorite standards. I knew that at least one song was a duet with Louis Armstrong and I had no problem with that. I have an old vinyl recording of their duets. I was surprised, however, to find that nearly half of the songs are duets with ""Satchmo."" I bought this CD to hear pure Ella. I was also surprised that some of the songs are from very old master tapes when her voice was much less mature, although in some ways even more pure than it later was. On one hand, this was enthralling; but on the other hand, the quality of the recording was not very good, having clearly been made on old equipment that is a far cry from modern standards. Overall, the songs themselves being sung by this legendary singer made it worth the investment."
5,This is a great release of early Ella...,"If you have always enjoyed early songs from the great herself you will certainly love this album. It has her first big hit ""A-Tisket A-Tasket"" and some of the good duets with Louis Armstrong that are very enjoyable. This is a recording that sounds like you're playing it on the old phonograph right from the era. Really an enjoyable release!"
1,"3 pictured in discription, 1 received","There really isn't much to say about a pencil. It works, it can be sharpened, it is a pencil. This pencil is VERY VERY VERY expensive. They seller pictues 3 pencils and if you read carefully (which I did not, shame on me) they are only selling ONE pencil. Look for a better deal, they are easy to find."
3,Poor spelling in the kindle version,"I eventually bought and read this entire ""cosy"" mystery series on my kindle. I enjoyed this series that I had never read as a kid. I loved the character of the Rabbi and his wife.My only complaint is that the OCR scanning that created the books changed a lot of words to the wrong word. I would constantly read ""ail"" for ""all"" or ""he"" for ""be"". It seems like most pages had an error and sometimes I would have to reread a sentence to understand it. For the price of these books, they certainly should have paid a proofreader to catch and fix most of these errors."
3,Interesting insight into the life of a crime solving rabbi,"This book was interesting when you know the background that the author wanted to explain the Jewish religion and someone said it would be more interesting if he told it in the form of a mystery. I understand that it worked so well, he continued to make it into a series. I did not know ""whodunnit"" until it was revealed at the end, and I'm not sure if that's because some of the clues were so well-hidden or if the author just withheld just enough info to spring the answer at the end. The writing was a little dry, but the new storyline made up for the lack of descriptive passages."
4,Enjoyable,I bought this for my e reader. The story was challenging for my deductive reasoning and an easy read. Thanks!
4,Well-written murder mystery......,"The books is an easy & enjoyable read. It's a little dated, but that seems to make it all the more charming. The plot was a la Agatha Christie, very well done. I look forward to reading more of these books in the future. The characters are well formed and very, very human."
3,One more book about drunk Irishmen. I'm tired of stereotypes,"There's nothing wrong with a good pint, so why is Frankie's father portrayed as such a bad guy?!? Cheers!"
2,Depressing - Those Poor Children,"I read this story for a book club, and that sense of accountability was the main reason that I finished it.The McCourt family's life did not have to be so bad, and the children did not have to be malnourished.I know we have no right to judge others, but how could the parents keep spending what little they had on alcohol and cigarettes and give the babies sugar water to quiet them when they were hungry? Didn't the children deserve some kind of priority? Didn't this constitute child neglect?Some of the children did make it, but oh, things didn't have to be that bad.I must say, this book was depressing. Although, more power to the author for ending up alright despite his childhood impoverishment and neglect."
3,Insightful,I found this book to be very insightful into how this mans life was when he was a child. It reflects how things are in different countries and was a very compelling and emotional book. I day you should read and try it out!
3,No Quotation marks!?,"This story is probably very beautiful. With that being said, I'm only roughly 2% through. The main issue that I have is the lack of quotation marks. It's simply hard for me to read this combined with the Irish slang. I do intend on attempting to get through this, but quotation marks would be oh so helpful..."
2,Ashes in the Mouth,"This opinion is evidently heretical. I must admit to being only 150 pages into the book and am weary of reading how Dad spent the family's dole money in the pub (which has happened about 20 times so far)while his children starve and die of pneumonia. The portrait of Irish poverty is gripping but degrading in its constancy and pervasiveness. Enough is enough! The style is flowing (storytelling style, not, great literature) and had the book been written by anyone else, I wouldn't have slogged through the Limmerick mud even this far."
3,educational autobiography..,"Angela's Ashes has a lot going for it. It describes an absolutely horrific childhood in Ireland during the 1930s/1940s. I had no idea there was so much poverty in Ireland only a generation ago. Very eye-opening. The book is also very accessible (ie, easy to read).But upon finishing the novel I didn't quite understand what drove folks to survive through such hardship, and why most seemed to be fatalist about their plight. While I can understand that perhaps Frank McCourt, as a child, didn't have much thought on the matter, surely later on in his teens (towards the end of Angela's Ashes) developed firm opinions on his parents, his environment, etc. This would have made the book more thought-provoking and less of a ""childhood from hell"" documentary.Having said all this, Angela's Ashes is a great achievement."
4,"A Memoir, Not a Fictional Novel","I had to keep in mind that this was a memoir, and not a work of fiction, otherwise, I would have hated this book.Wasn't anyone else bothered by the mother? She is content to just sit there and exist. Her children are starving and dying and she doesn't even think about getting a job. No, she'd rather go begging for scraps of meat and rags for clothing. Why take care of your teeth? You can just go and get a set of falsies!The book was well-written and intriguing. My only complaint is that I did not see the mother as an angel, or as anything admirable at all."
3,Nothing great in this story,Whilst this is a well written poignant story there is nothing new in it or particulary alluring to keep you reading. In fact the story is rather dismal and depressing. If you are feeling down and want to prove that others have had troubles worse than yours pick up this book and have a good read. If you are after entertainment you won't want to read this book.
5,Deserves more than 5 stars,"This book was great. It was funny at times and then when you turned the page you feel tears falling from your eyes. This book was incredible. I read it in 2 days and loved it. I have seen the movie and loved that also, although it was very depressing as well as the book. The book was better though. I am going to start 'Tis but from what I hear it is not as good as Angela's Ashes. Either way I will read it to find more about Frank McCourt's Life. This book is highly recommended"
2,Angela's Tears -,"It is probably the most depressing book I've ever read. If you're down in the dumps to begin with - don't read this book.My mother grew up in an Irish family. Her mother had to live with her maiden sister, who helped to raise my mother and her two brothers due to a father that spent most of his time away from family and reciting poetry in bars for a drink. He only showed upon occasionally to give everyone a beating and then be gone again.From what I've been told, my grandmother would go to the rectory to ask for an annulment, only to be refused.I never knew that my grandfather was alive until he died when I was in the third grade.Maybe it was too close to home."
2,Angel's Ashes,"Not my favorite book. The story was very depressing. The constant Irish slang got old fast. The book ended like the author just got tired of writing about these pour pathetic people. No resolution, what does Angel's Ashes have to do with it. She was still alive unfortunately when the book ended."
1,scroll down through the reviews,"As you will read, the 4 and 5 star ratings all come from emotionally dominated saps. Search out the 1 or 0 star ratings to get a realistic review before you waste your money and time on this overrated treatise. All who did like it, go back to watching Oprah and Rosie. Your opinions in the literary world are so much fluff."
1,Dull and Boring,I would not recommend this book to anyone with an IQ over 50. The father gets drunk. He does or doesn't look for a job. A child is born. A child dies. The father gets drunk. There you have it.
5,A Good Book!,"Angelas Ashes has got to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read. And yet I was unable to put it down, not even to wipe away the tears that came from reading about the hunger and saddness the McCourt family faced in Ireland. Being an Irish Catholic myself, I was easily able to relate to many of the experiences Frankie encountered. McCourt's writing style also made an impact on me. His very simple, easy to understand word use and his ability to make the book sound as if a young irish boy was actually telling the story directly, makes Angelas Ashes one of the best novels I have ever read."
4,Language alive,One can almost imagine the voice of Frank McCourt as you read this true Irish tale of impoverished childhood. The language brings the story into your mind and keeps the book in your hands until the very end. Tis' a good one.
4,Irish folklore,"This is an old book that I finally read...it was hard to get through, there was so much hardship. It was a sad/funny tome on poverty and politics in Ireland."
5,Angela's Ashes,This was a book well written by an author who must have lived or knew someone who had this life style. I can't imagine how an author of McCourt's intelligence could have written such a book. I'm anxious to read Tis now. I can't say enough about the intelligence it took to write such a book.
3,Angela's Ashes,"Angela's Ashes, by Frank McCourt, is the story of an Irish Cathloic boy born in the United States who learns to adapt to the poverty stricken town of Limerick. Frank vividly recaps the disturbing events of his childhood, while keeping the reader hopeful right up to the last page. Although Frank has to take on the man of the house role, while his father drinks himself stupid, his determined will to survive pervails. This memoir is narrated in the first person by a young Frank who uses blunt language and childish syntax. After reading this book you will feel like you can overcome any obstacle you experience with a smile on your face."
5,Angelas' Ashes,"This is one of the best book I have ever read. Frank McCourt writes of his childhood and his experiences. This book will remain in your mind forever, because of the imagery and memories it brings to the reader. READ THIS!!!!"
3,Angela's Ashes,"Gross and depressing tale of a boy's life in Ireland. I didn't find this tale too believable, either. Mother was awful -- didn't take care of the kids, couldn't recognize illness, slovenly, desperate. Father a no-good drunk. Too much description of excrement, vomit, scabby sores and puss. Yuck! Funny scenes when boy is making confession. Paints a terrible picture of Irish and of Catholics. Some good tangential stories but, on the whole, a depressing mess."
5,Stunning!,"Frank McCourt's memoir of a life of poverty ranges from New York to the streets of Limerick Ireland. His father ""being from the North"" has the Ireland desease, alcoholism. None the less Frankie and his kid brothers grow up piously and express some hilarious moments through eyes of a child. Thank-you Mr. McCourt for writing an excellent memoir in a beautiful way! I can't wait for the follow up ""'Tis"" coming in 1999."
5,"Beautifully written, moving book!","I listened to the unabridged recording of this book on my way to and from work, and could hardly wait to get to the car for more! This book is without a doubt the best I have read this year, if not one of the best I have ever read. In fact, I bought a copy of the hardcover to add it to my shelf of favorites.Listening to Frank McCourt himself read his own words was a wonderful way to experience this book. The lilting accent, the voices he used for his father, mother, brothers, teachers, and priests, and his singing undoubtedly added to my enjoyment of his book. Powerful and uplifting, it made me laugh and cry. I can only hope for a sequel; I want to know more."
5,BEST BOOK I HAVE READ(SO FAR),"This book I would recommend to anyone. It is a excellent book READ IT!!!! You will probably enjoy it!!!!!! I am only 12 and I loved it, I understood it so I bet you will too!!!!!!!!!"
2,It was okay,"Yeah, I must admit that McCourt did have a hard life. But naming the book after his mother kind of put her on a pedestal in my opinion, and that let me down as I read the book because she was not a great person. And also, I think that Frankie (the main character) did things that other boys his age shouldn't be doing, and I didn't enjoy reading those parts, especially in great detail. I do not think that I would buy this book again."
2,Not as amazing as made out to be.,"I was required to read this book for a school projet, and I took my teachers advice and came to the book with an open mind and high expectations based upon his praise. The first chapters are interesting and fun, as you feel for the character and his life struggles. But as time trudges on, I began to realise that this book was written by either a mentally challanged person or someone who is just plain dumb. While the lack of conventional grammar and punctuation is sometimes regarded as 'genious' I found it annoying and childish. I heard in his other book he became an English teacher? I hope not. That's embarrasing to be an English teacher and write like that.Call me what you will for insulting one of the 'best written books of our century', as my English professor called it, but I found it childish, immature, and highly unbelievable from the point of a allegeded memior."
2,One too many mentions of overflowing outhouses,Some of the charm of the child's tale is lost by adult McCourt's obsession with overflowing outhouses and the like.
1,"I might be the only person in America who feels this way,","but I didn't like Angela's Ashes. I thought it was insincere. If I were from Limerick, Ireland, I'd be offended. I find it hard to believe that almost everyone in Limerick is as cruel as Mr. McCourt portrays them. Mr. McCourt's book is bitter and raw, but to what purpose? I have no desire to read 'Tis, but I'm hoping that many chapters are devoted to Mr. McCourt's therapy sessions.I would recommend Rick Bragg's All Over but the Shoutin'. Bragg deals with the same theme, growing up impoverished and overcoming a difficult childhood, but he writes with a lot more sensitivity. Of course, Rick Bragg had a wonderful mother. And, I bet that makes all the difference."
5,A Great Book,"What a sad childhood this guy had. I think a lot of us can relate to a certain degree. It's great that he made something of himself even with a father like his that was a terrible role model. It just goes to show you no matter what we went through when we were kids, when you leave home you can rise above poverty by working hard and making the right choices. You don't have to be like your parents. This book kept my attention even at the very beginning. For me, if it starts out dull I won't read the rest but I could not put this book down. I can't wait to read the other one's."
4,World of weeping,"""Dad says I'll understand when I grow up. He tells me that all the time now and I want to be big like him so that I can understand everything. It must be lovely to wake up in the morning and understand everything. I wish I could be like all the big people in the church, standing and kneeling and praying and understanding everything. p.132Through his childhood biography, McCourt created a novel that was not only true but was also real. One family. One miserable family struggling through life at the bottom. McCourt's words were a steady stream of hardship, hurdles and grief. I admire this work. The novel was a very honest look into its author's soul and of his outlook on life."
5,TRIUMPHANT!,"This was a real page turner, and once you have started, count on not putting it down again until you have finished laughing, crying, reading your way to the end! I was personally thanking my lucky stars above that my own miserable childhood (I thought) ""could have been much worse!"" A guarantee...you can't read ANGELA'S ASHES and not want to read 'TIS soon after!"
1,I don't get it.,"I can't believe all the fuss and accolades about this book. To me, it's a load of whiny self-pitying tripe. Intolerable.1 star is too much for this book."
3,I skipped a lot of paragraphs,"I simply did not identify with the style that Frank McCourt wrote this book. I found myself skipping pages to get to better parts. Perhaps it was what was happening in my life at the time, therefore I could not allow myself to get swept up in it.Though I do want to say that my Mum, Brother and friend all thoroughly enjoyed it and as my Mum said, ""when he ran down the street I was running with him"". She found it totally unputdownable.I did get from it though the way life was back then and will definitely go see the film.I think this is the type of book YOU must make up your own mind to read. Most people I know have loved this."
1,HONESTLY not worth all the hype,"I simply base my judgment in books according to the entertainment value. This book lacked precisely that, and I must say, it was a hard book to finish. I am surprised it received such a positive response overall. Shocked."
5,Poor Irish Catholic childhood,"I thought Angela's Ashes was so moving, I cried through most of the book. I also laughted at Frank McCourt's sense of humor, even with the sad childhood he grew up in. Frank McCourt grew up with so much responsiblity as a small boy, he was a strong and compassionate child. It was unbelievable what he and his younger brothers had to deal with, and they survived it somehow. I was born and raised in the 1950's here in the US, the third oldest child, of a poor Irish Catholic family. We did not have a lot, but we never went to bed hungry. Reading his book helped me understand what dirt poor really meant. I thank God, my mother, and father for what we really did have. Reading Angela's Ashes has change my whole out look on life, I thank Frank McCourt for this special gift he has shared with all of us."
3,A great memory for a young lad.,"An exaggerated story of pathos stretched to draw a tear from every emigrant forced to find a living far from their homeland. If you want the real Ireland of youth read Roddy Doyle's 'Paddy Clark Ha Ha Ha' , a man who lives in , knows and loves his country. Mr. Mc Court certainly claims a fine long term memory."
2,De-PRESS-ing,"I guess it would be a good book if you are okay with the unending misery of hunger and spineless alcoholism. These books where the wife is so noble and long suffering while the father drinks the money away are so miserable it is hard to read.I understand in those days, there were not a lot of choices for women with children. Certainly not divorce in Catholic Ireland at that time.I'm just saying after the first one hundred pages it gets redundant."
3,"Poignant, Amusing - but Dubious Veracity - NOT Joyce!","McCourt's book is amusing for his own experience, but it does not transfer to the overall Irish or Irish American immigrant experience. The recounting of his early childhood seems to rife with details of events he was not present at to be factual. The man is a great storyteller, but he should have written a novel based on his experiences. He doesn't hold a candle to Roddy Doyle, and should not even be mentioned in the same universe as James Joyce."
4,Interesting Read,"Frank McCourt has a unique writing style. He does a very good job of getting his points across. Some parts are hilarious and others are depressing, but all-in-all, it's worth well worth it."
2,It was downhill after the first few pages...,"After hearing so many positive things about the book and putting off reading it, I decided to read it several years after its publication and subsequent movie release. Not having seen the movie yet, I was particularly curious about the book.I was miserable but nonetheless captivated for the first third of the book. The details and imagery were very poignant even though the style of prose (e.g. very little use of punctuation or dialogue indicators) was a bit difficult to get used to. There were several moments when I was moved quite nearly to tears with sympathy.However, shortly thereafter, I began to get weary of the story and noticed that it did not seem to be going anywhere. Furthermore, the older he got, the more I found myself disliking the narrator. By the end, his endless ramblings about masturbation marathons and worse finally convinced me that I may finish the book but I certainly wasn't going to like it.I would not recommend this book."
5,Awesome,no problems with this attachment works great. shipment was on time and packaged very well. will buy more of this brand of toy
2,Poor Implementation of ACL's,"I sent the company some feedback last week and have heard nothing from them. Product does not apply ACL's properly to interfaces and has problems recording matches to outbound ACL's. Also there are problems with alternate vlans on 2950 switches. Numerous bugs running verion 5.07 with latest patch. Was a very disappointing purchase.Dennis Byford, CCNP"
3,"good for training, but seems incomplete","It is a good tool for exam practice, but doesn't seem too useful for practical network mapping, simulation, or planning. There's just too much that's incomplete. Commands are missing including some advanced routing protocol support, there's no support for larger switches, and some of the diagnostics are pretty kludgy. There is a CCNP version of the software that supposedly addresses these, but I haven't tried it. It may seem fairly expensive, but it is still a lot cheaper than buying an assortment of cisco gear to run through the exercises."
3,Nice idea but the product is Obsolete for the current CCNA exam,"This product has got the right idea of simulating Cisco products so a person can use software instead of purchasing the actual Cisco equipment to practice for the CCNA exam. However, this product has a number of major flaws in the software and it has been obsoleted since Cisco announced the new version of their CCNA exam last June. You best wait for an updated version that has better quality software and supports the current Cisco products (Routers and Switches) at a more current IOS version."
1,BOSON Network Sim - SCAM,This particular purchase was miss leading from the start. I received this product with the understanding that this was a recent publication. When I finally received the product it was an eight year old software which was at best obsolete. I contacted the CISCO manufacture and they will not support this undoubtly obsolete version.
4,CCNA Simular Works Great!,"This is a great learning tool for anyone who is taking the CCNA curriculum. It works well. The only thing is that it does not support all of the router commands that are in the Cisco curriculum labs. I would find that a lot of times, I would get halfway through the lab and then it would not recognize a command. Other than this ""glitch"" or if you want to pay through the nose for the CCNP version it's still worth the money. I finished my Cisco curriculum with an A because of the practice labs and the labs included. It sure beats buying the real thing and playing with it. Especially if you want to save some money.Buy it...You'll like it! :)"
1,"Shop around, there's better","It's hard to believe that Cisco/Boson is still using Visual Basic in a ""modern"" product. And not the .net flavor either. If they can't update the application to a modern language and a serious user interface, it makes you wonder where else they are cutting corners. Although it might support the certification, I found this router simulation too clunky to use."
1,Do NOT waste your money on this one!,This Cisco simulator is horribly put together with use of poor graphical interfaces and poor functionality! Take my advice look elsewhere!
3,Bahamas Abacos Cruising DVD,DVD is actually a tranfer of VHS to DVD and has inherent poor video (not shot digitally). It is informative but could have been done a lot better/more professionally. A lot of time is spent with the camera showing a chart that someone is narrating and it would make more sense to have some form of pointer moving over the chart to show exactly what is being talked about as it is definitely NOT that clear. Additionally a lot of the video/aerial shots is not necessarily timed with the narrative. Could be a lot better!
2,Disappointing,"This was a poor quality video and was very disappointing. THis is such a beautiful area, I don't know why they couldn't do a better job of presenting it. I have not found a good Abaco video yet, but skip the video, just go to the Abacos!"
1,Definitely read it.,"some fo the most ignorant arguments you'll ever hear in your life. If you want to explain to god why you didn't love all of creation make sure you have this book with you when you get there. As a philosophy major and licensed therapist i have to say, truly ignorant."
4,10 Years!,Can't believe time pass by so quick. It was 10 years ago I first listened to this album and It's still one of my favourites.So many nice joints!My Homies!*You must be used to all the finer things....*
1,FIRE DJ SPANK!!!!,"Now I am only speakin for the screwed version of this, DJ SPANK NEEDS TO GET SOME TALENT. Here is another good cd ruined by Spank. I should have bought the regular version and done it myself. I have much love for Rap-a-lot, but not for Spank.RIP DJ SCREW,FATPAT,BIG MELLO."
4,These holes can't rationalize their sloth to me,"I always wondered about folk who sample other human being's creative efforts . This interesting little film only confirms what i already suspected , that said people are ""largely"" deluded ""takers"" . We're not talking Bugge Wesseltoft here folks . He samples himself + is a gifted artist . We're talking opportunistic (in the bad way) ""fidiots"" . Anathema to bonifide music creators of ALL genres . For the record , i feel the same way about Us3 as i do about the folks depicted here . What's occuring here is neither the ""future"" nor art . I refuse to punish the film's makers with a poor rating ."
3,Introduction to a Sample,"Not bad, but nothing that will blow you away. A good basic introduction to what sampling is and it's relevance to the Hip Hop genre.High points are interviews with Clyde Stubblefield and Hank Shocklee.It is about an hour long, and does not go into any great details as to the actual process of sampling in a production context."
3,stick to the original mix,"the R&B mix takes the song down a notch and it loses all its NRG.If you have the full CD, don't go out of your way to grab this remix."
3,Big Will! (3.5 Stars),"The Fresh Prince has been rapping for close to 20 years now, and even though Will's rap career has arguably taken a backseat to his movie career, he's still making music and keeping it genuine. That alone deserves MAD props.Switch is a pretty cool song for the dance floor, and I'm extremely glad Will isn't following any trends - like jumping onto the Crunk bandwagon. Nope, Switch is just another infectious Will Smith pop hit.Big Will must be in love with hip-hop, because with the kind of money he has, he could stop making records at any time to focus on his acting career. But his desire to make music, and make it genuine, shows some kind of integrity that I've never seen in a musician-turned-actor."
3,Nice I guess,I was kind of unhappy with the album. He is going at it more lyrically but he gave up some fun. This is one of the Fun tracks. It is not the best track but it's cool
2,Switch The Station If You Hear This Song On The Radio,"When I first heard this song I didn't know who it was by, but I liked it. So when I found out that it was a Will Smith song, I didn't like it as much anymore. The more you listen to it the dumber it sounds. Will Smith is getting old and he needs to stop the rapping. I will say ""Switch"" isn't as bad as""Gettin' Jiggy With It."" Now that was AWFUL."
1,LOL!,Will Smith is def my favorite actor but his singles are lame as heahl! though not as bad as the laugh out loud Nod Ya Head this still falls in the WACK catagory. Just as I thought he would go away from the rap scene forever here he is again. Sure HE may be happy but I surely aint.
2,Service was great,"Video content not good, The Quality of the video was good . The form and instruction was not at the level I was looking for"
3,Information is terrific,The quality was not good but the information was very good (my son says). Information is terrific the video coverage was not very good. It was worth it for the information he says. He has a black belt in tae kwon do.
5,Simple and effective,"Used this device for home studio and mobile dj performances. Never had any issues, continues to work like new. Owned 3+ years."
3,Great seats for Jeep except...,"Seat frame is awsome, but the cover is made of a cheap neoprene-wetsuit material. Never expose to sun or they will fade the first day. I had mine recovered with a Cordura 500 material and now they rock!!!!"
5,beautiful book!,"quality publication displaying ancient photographs of all the major attractions in Rome.. example, is a picture of GOATS around the Spanish Steps"
5,Rome at a glance,Frederica does an excellent job going through all of Rome's highlights while giving information and stories not necessarily known. It's fun and informative at the same time. Every person I've shown the book to loved it even if they haven't been to Rome yet.
1,Deeply disappointed,Want a fun 45 minute dancey workout to country music. You won't get it with this DVD. The music is not country and the only thing country about the whole thing is the instructor has pig tails and boots on. Even the people behind her can't follow her instructions and the moves are basically aerobics. I bought one for myself and one for my neice as a Christmas present. I just called my sister and said to throw it away before even opening it. What a waste of money and time.
1,These Stones Speak,I have not received the book. My credit card has been charged. I have sent letters and NO rely. Amazon I want my money BACK!!!!Mr. Joe Brown
3,A little boring,This book seems to be more for someone in social science than someone in English like I am. It is ok.
5,Best Clancy Movie,"Out of the four Tom Clancy/Jack Ryan movies, I think Clear and Present Danger is easily the best. Harrison Ford is one of my favorite actors, and even though he's made some dreck in recent years, his string of successes post-Star Wars and Indiana Jones reached their peak around this time.The story of the film revolves around the U.S. war on drugs, attempting to stop the flow at the source of production in Colombia. To this end, Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan becomes caught up in the action along with the always-great Willem DaFoe as CIA agent Clark. Just about all of the actors in this movie are great, including Joaquim de Almeida, Donald Moffat, Henry Czerny (the slime dripping off his character might damage your TV), and Raymond Cruz.Not only is this one of my favorite spy/government intrigue movies, but it's just flat-out one of my favorite movies. Great story, great actors, great movie. Highly recommended."
3,"Good Overall, but Also Too Predictable -","The film is based on a Tom Clancy high-tech espionage situation involving drug smuggling into the U.S. Harrison Ford is assigned an anti-drug investigation after a friend of the president is murdered by a drug cartel. The National Security Adviser and a deputy CIA director combine to send a secret military force into Columbia to attack the drug forces, only to abandon them when Ford exposes the illegal operation. Ford then goes to Columbia to help rescue what is left of the force.Lots of double-crosses, all quite predictable."
4,Excellent video,"One of those movies that I can't get enough of because of good actors, high tech, jungle (rain forest), military back stabbing and just plain behind the scenes of what we THINK goes on in the drug trade. Just a good movie provided by Amazon at a very good price. I've seen it maybe eight times now and will watch it again."
3,Pretty good flick,"I like this movie. It's not great but it is entertaining and a good action film. The scenes of the attack on the entourage are very well done. I waffled between a three and a four star rating, so it's really about a 3 1/2 star for me."
2,Overblown dreck...,"This third installment of the Jack Ryan series gets too confused too quick and can't find a way out. It also contains way too much action for a movie that wants to be taken seriously. Harrison Ford is Jack Ryan again, and he's the worst to date. Alec Baldwin will forever be the best Ryan and Ford and Affleck will just have to deal with it. In this movie, it's Ryan vs. everybody from Columbians to the president of the United States himself in a plot so perplexing it's a wonder the movie ever gets off the ground. This is not that good of a movie and a poor follow-up to the cool ""Patriot Games."" I'm disappointed."
1,PISSED OFF!,"I was robbed. I paid the money for the blu-ray and it was never sent to me. I tried contacting the seller several times and NEVER received a reply. Amazon.com has got to do something about sellers like this and compensating buyers like me that have been ripped off. Even if they don't do it because it's good business to keep the customer happy and buying, especially in this terrible economy, do it because it's the right thing to do. FYI: since this has happened I've spent $250 on the purchase of Blu-Ray movies --from BLOCKBUSTER. Money I would have happily given to Amazon.com or any seller, if only I wasn't ignored and my request unanswered."
3,"Top-Notch Suspense Thriller. Lacks A Solid Conclusion, Though.","Harrison Ford, Anne Archer & James Earl Jones return for the next Jack Ryan adventure, ""Clear And Present Danger."" Teeming with suspense all the way through, the film, however, lacks a comeuppance for the main villains. Willem Dafoe joins the cast (who he plays is a major surprise), as do Henry Czerny, Dean Jones (""The Love Bug"") &Benjamin Bratt. Rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG."
5,Fantastic Sequel To Patriot Games,"In ""Clear and Present Danger,"" Harrison Ford once again plays Jack Ryan, the intrepid hero of Tom Clancy's novels, who was first played in films by Alec Baldwin in ""The Hunt For Red October,"" and then by Ford in ""Patriot Games.""In this film, Ford ends up caught up in a web of danger and intrigue involving the President, the death of one of the President's closest friends, Colombian drug cartels, and CIA black-ops agents. As usual, Ryan finds himself battling against all sides to get to the truth and trying to stay alive while doing it. Ford is superb as usual as Ryan, Willem Dafoe is excellent as the leader of the black ops group, and Joaquin de Almeida plays a properly sinister and nasty villain.This is one of the best thrillers made by Hollywood in a long time, and should please Clancy and non-Clancy fans alike."
4,Action packed political thriller.,"I love Harrison Ford movies and this one has plenty of action in it, plus a political subplot that remains relevant even today."
4,Good entertainment!,"I enjoyed this move quite a bit, it was pretty hard to follow in some parts, but overall it was great! Harrison Ford is great in this movie and the action scenes are awesome!Reccomended!"
3,Great Plot But Not A Family Movie,"As with many movies, this movie has a pretty good plot and good actors; but it doesn't have family value! There is quite a bit of vulgarity in this one... I would suggest looking elsewhere if you're interested in solid family values!"
4,Good show,"Good movie, although I preferred to hate the bad guys that are in the book version. Other than that, it's a blast."
5,Action packed,Harrison Ford is my all time favorite actor. I enjoy all his movies. This is an action packed movie. Never a dull moment.
5,Best Jack Ryan Film!,I love this movie and could watch it a million times. Harrison Ford and Willem Dafoe turn in great performances.
4,Another Harrison Ford performance,Although there are other Harrison Ford movies I like better; this one is very good. Other characters get in the way a bit too often.
3,Clear and present mistakes,"Harrison Ford (Jack P.Ryan), the Deputy Director Intelligence did not carry a gun even in hostages rescue operation in Colombia.Another mistake, Harrison Ford (Jack P.Ryan) used his business card as an ID card - he showed his business card to a drugs gang to prove his Identity-!"
2,Apparently directors and screenwriters cant read.,This is a BAD film version of a GREAT book. nuf said.
3,Good but...,"It is a very entertaining movie. William Dofoe as usual doing a great job of playing his role. But for 20 bucks, I wished the publisher would have added more features. I also had hope they had published it in anamorphic format or dual format, wide screen and anamorphic letterbox."
3,Always a Bankable Actor,"Harrison Ford turns in another strong star performance as CIA man Jack Ryan in ""Clear and Present Danger"". Suspenseful action drama where you're never really certain who's white hat and who's black hat--and that just about sums up America's foreign policy, anyway. Good support from Willem Dafoe, too."
4,"Good movie, but better book....",The third installment of Clancy movies and the 2nd of the Harrison Ford movies was better than Patriot Games but not as good as Red October. I thought Alec Baldwin was a closer match to Ryan than Harrison Ford. Ryan in the books seems to be Preppyish and Alec Baldwin got that to a T. Harrison Ford seemed too much like a average guy to be Ryan although he was better in this movie. I thought some of the stuff that happened in the book was better though.
4,A great story and a good movie,"After watching this movie several times, I've come to realize that I really like the fact that Jack Ryan is a ""boy scout,"" that he knows the difference between right and wrong, and that he is willing to do the right thing regardless of where that might take him. Many of our current government enties could take lessons from the character, Jack Ryan.Harrison Ford does a great job in this show, and there are good supporting actors involved as well. DeFoe, whom I've really enjoyed as an actor since I noticed him in ""Platoon"" does a great job, but he wasn't how I pictured Clark to look at all.All in all a good show with interesting plot twists. Give it a try."
4,"Good, but.....","I did enjoy this movie. The sniper training and stalking were first rate. BUT, I just could not understand why Jack Ryan would not pick up a firearm to defend himself. It had been demonstrated in past stories that he did indeed know how to handle something that goes bang. I guess it is just now a bad thing to have the good guy touch something as evil as a sidearm or rifle....even to save a life."
2,Not even close,"Once there was a man named Jack Ryan. That's about where the similarities to the book end.For what it's worth, I'm not a picky movie viewer. I'll watch nearly anything. So for me to complain about this movie means that something was really off-base.As far as an action movie goes, it was passable. As far as the technological thriller that the book was, it doesn't even come close. There is no character development (never felt anything towards Ding), random changes in a character's persona (Clark goes from wanting to kill Ryan to making the chopper go back), thing missing that are important to the plot (downing of drug running planes), and things that were never in the book (yacht owner tied to the President).To make what could be an extremely long review somewhat shorter, if you've read the book and are a fan of Tom Clancy, don't bother. If you're just looking for a film with "" 'splosions,"" this might work."
2,CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER,"THE MOVIE WAS GREAT THE FIRST HALF, THEN IT STARTED JUMPING AND SLOWING DOWN. WE HAD TO RESTART IT SEVERAL TIMES. NOT ONE I WANT TO WATCH AGAIN. IT SEEMED TO BE A USED MOVIE RATHER THAN A NEW ONE. !!!"
4,"Excellent Plot, So-So Acting...","Harrison's acting was a little transparent this time around. The main cartel guy with the mustache, his acting was that of an amatuer. It almost ruined the whole movie. Also, the President's character seemed to be an ""over the top"" cliche of what we think a President should be.Outside of the acting and casting flaws, it was compelling..."
3,"It's okay, but rather lacking...","I've read Tom Clancy's ""Clear and Present Danger"" and it's a great book. As for the movie, it leaves something to be desired. The plot very loosely follows the book. First of all, the Coast Guard cutter has a male captain, and the cutter and its crew play a HUGE role in the book, whereas in the movie, the captain is female and the cutter plays a tiny role. Secondly, Jack Ryan and Dan Murray do NOT go to Colombia with Emil Jacobs, and Dan Murray does NOT get killed. Third, John Clark is not some sort of rogue CIA agent controlling Army Spec Ops units. Fourth, when Jack Ryan goes down to Colombia, he goes with the support of an entire Air Force Search & Rescue unit. Other than that, it was okay."
5,As good as it gets,"Harrison Ford gets appointed as CIA Deputy Director of Intelligence. His first assignment is to investigate the murder of one of the President's friends, a prominent U.S. businessman with secret ties to Colombian drug cartels. Enough said, An action packed movie with an excellent story behind it that keeps you stuck to your couch from start to finish wishing the movie was an hour longer. The quality of the DVD is excellent with DTS , so prepare yourself to some great sound effects. Highly recommended."
5,"Great actors, Great plot, from a great book","Clear and Present Danger was one of the best movies i've ever seen. It has a great deal of action, and blood, and all the other good stuff. It dosent deter far from the plot of the book. If you're thinking of buying it, i would recomend it for all people who like action."
5,JACK,ITS ANOTHER JACK RYAN MOVIETHE FIRST JACK WAS ALEC BALDWIN BUT HARRISON FORD MADE FOR THIS ROLE I THINK ITS BETTER
3,only buy if your going to be very delicate and not change the size,this being my third pair of skullcandy Ti headphones i was very optimistic that they wouldn't break on me. the cable design on this set was definitely much better than previous models and i had no problems with it. The place where i came into problems were with the areas where you can extend the headphone to make it bigger. they are quite small when they are at their smallest size and most people have to make them bigger. within about 2 weeks this pair had cracked on both sides and now i have to be very very careful with them so they don't crack anymore. looks like i will be filling out another warranty card and have to get my third replacement pair. they are good headphones but they just really need to fix this cracking problem
4,OK headphones,"These headphones are average and based on reviewers before these headphones are not great and they are not bad. The sound of these skullcandy headphones ar once again average, if you are really looking for headphones with amazing base the beats by dr. dre are they way to go but i would suggest waiting a while until the price of those headphones goes done. These headphones ar very stylish which is the reason i bought them, they are above average in my opinion in the comfort factor as the fur part are the most comfortable but like a reviewer said before they are wierd with a guy. If you are looking for style headphones get these but if you are looking for base get something else because these have an average volume level and not very great base."
2,Headband broke within a month,"The headband cracked within a month of purchase. I have sent a request for replacement to Skullcandy and am waiting for a reply. I am concerned that even with a replacement, the headband may crack again, because the headphones fit very tightly, so a lot of stress is put on the headband when the earphones are pulled apart to put the headphones on. As far as look and sound, the headphones are nice, hence two stars for this item instead of one."
3,TI Headphones,"Sound quality is out of this world amazing.However, the adjustment of the headset could be a little more versatile as the headset seems to pull in on both sides causing pressure to the outer ear drums. Thinking about exchanging them for a different pair."
4,Good sound,"The left side works intermittently. I will have to send under warranty, and I prefer not having to deal with this aggravation for a brand new and expensive product."
4,They're no Bose...,"First, the main con - the headphones unfortunately lack good, heavy bass! The main pro - the volume and clarity are nice enough for you to still enjoy your music and block out external noises. They're lightweight; the headband sits comfortably on my head and the speakers fit nicely over my ears without pinching (even though I always wear hoop earrings - major plus). The long cord allows plenty of freedom and the volume clip is pretty convenient. Overall, these are fun headphones and great for use at work. The style attracts a little attention as well. :)"
3,skullcandy Ti headphones,"This product is good quality but there were a few issues I came across such as a much lower volume limit than i expected. One side of the headphones snapped within 2 weeks of non-rough usage.These headphones are very fragile. On the good side the headphones have excellent soundquality and they are very comfortable, but that is about it."
2,skull candy headphones,"These headphones, however very stylish and comfortable to wear, are NOT worth the money. Unfortunately, very overpriced due to the fact that when you are wearing them, EVERYONE around you can hear what you are listening to. The only way to block out noise to hear your music is to turn them up loudly, and then other's complain. My son recieved them very graciously and with much ado, but alas, he is selling them to the top bidder at school as we speak because although he LOVES the look of them, they do not give one the privacy that you would hope to have with such large ear coverings. They are great to look at, but if you like your privacy, don't buy these."
3,Design was good..not loud enough though,"I was really excited for these headphones. They came and my first impression was good. They looked really stylish and trendy. The sound is not as loud as i was hoping, but it's not bad. You will like it."
4,Looks great sounds okay,"Can't beat the look for the price and the sound is what you pay for. With that you can decide, its No BOSE but you will get props for how it looks. I get stoped almost everyday and people ask me who makes it. Specailly cause they are white."
5,Roy and Gale Together!,"Another excellent Roy Rogers western giving his fans exactly what they want and expect. This movie has the extra bonus of being one of the 3 movies Roy made with Gale Storm. Aside from his wife, Dale Evans, Gale was Roy's best leading lady. This was before Gale became a star but her talent and beauty and star potential clearly show through."
1,Prominent Watermark Through Entire Film!,"Would like to see this film released by a company that doesn't feel the need to superimpose a large ""RE"" watermark throughout the entire film."
2,Singing Saved Him,"It took me 43 minutes to laugh once--damn shame because I really like Jamie Foxx, but I see why it took me so long to like him. This was not funny at all. The only thing that saved him was the dynamic singing performance at the end...the rest was wack!"
1,"If you loved Moby Dick, DON'T READ THIS!","This book was such a load of crap that I finished reading it for the sole purpose of giving it a bad review. It's 120 pages of two elderly men who have nothing to say about Moby Dick other than that they don't understand it, and the only reason it's a classic is because literary critics have to like it so that it doesn't look like they don't get it. Why would I spend $10 on a book about Moby Dick if I didn't like Moby Dick itself? Really? $10 to hear these two pompous men complain about the book being boring? And despite the great reviews here on Amazon, I found none of it to be funny. I bought this because I wanted some outside opinions and actual insight on one of my favorite novels. If I wanted to hear two guys complaining about Melville, reading off sports statistics and obsessing over weight loss, I would go back to high school."
2,really?,I paid $29.74 for this book new and when I received it in the mail the cover price of it was $9.95... I feel that this book isn't worth more than the $9.95 cover price and feel a little ripped off. Don't buy this book
5,Highly recommended!,"My two daughters (8.5 and 6) and I really loved this movie! Endearing, funny, heart-warming story, and the fact that the animals' mouths don't move (like today's creepy movies!) was appreciated by all of us. I've been telling my kids that we need to start watching some ""older"" movies, and this one fit the bill. Highly recommended!"
1,Very disappointing,"I expected this to contain live performances of this great artist. This is a documentary which interview people who have passed close to the artist. For example, a woman who works at Tower Records where he signed autographs once was interviewed for over 10 minutes. On top of that, none of his music was ever played. Even the interview with the man himself was dubbed over by a narrator. If you are a real Ricky fan, I would avoid this."
1,...,The whole DVD consisted of unknown people putting in there two cents about Ricky. He makes no appearence throughout the entire thing. ...
2,documentary only -no singing. Fair,"We were excited waiting for this DVD but were dis-appointed that it was only a documentary. It was slightly interesting but certainly not what we anticipated. There were no performances by Ricky and is an unauthorized bio on him and the history of salsa and latin music. I rate it only fair, unless a documentary is what you are interested in . We wanted to see him perform."
2,"Low production quality, but somewhat interesting","This is a low budget production that is mostly interviews with people that have met Ricky Martin. I had problems playing the English version on my DVD player, but was able to adjust the sound on my computer. There are a few pictures of Ricky and a few magazine covers that I have not seen before. There is one interview with Ricky (in Spanish)around the time he was promoting Vuelve spiced though out the video. All Spanish interviews are dubbed over by an interpreter."
5,Best boot I ever owned,The are best boots that I ever owned. The are great for the Minnesota weather. They keep my feet warm and dry while working out side. And are cool and comfortable while working in doors as well.
2,Bottom of the pile,"I am so disappointed with this video. The instructors were good, but the actual exercises are done poorly, and don't really target the areas that you need to shape up after pregnancy. I've used others that are also working out just with the baby, and I personally think they're far superior. I thought maybe since this one was more expensive, there would be something special to it, but now I know."
1,Worst boot ever,"I ordered a 10 it was to big and the lining had a defect in it, so I returned it and ordered a 9 as they don't have half sizes it was perfect on my left foot but to small on my right foot so frustrating."
5,Fascinating and Accessible,"Lively and accessible, Adoption Nation demonstrates how adoption is changing our concept of family to include not only people who are biologically related, but people who love each other, and that ties of affection can be as strong as ties of blood. The tone of this book is encouraging, warm and inclusive. But Adoption Nation is also a serious book, encyclopedic in scope, and provides a clear picture of the institution of adoption in 2001. I wish I had been able to read this book when my adopted daughter reunited with her birth family three years ago. I recommend this book to anyone touched by adoption, and also to readers interested in the state of our country. Adoption Nation would be a useful text for students of psychology or social work. Adam Pertman has written a wonderful book."
2,Adoption Nation,"Adoption Nation provides an interesting historical and sociological account of adoption. However, the author has a very clear bias and is not afraid to let it show throughout the book. He presents important facts, many of which I have not found in other books, however he does not fail to insert his own opinion about these facts in every place possible. If you agree with Mr. Pertman that absolutely open adoption is the only healthy alternative, international adoption is misguided, and that non-traditional families are morally incorrect when they wish to adopt healthy children (as Mr. Pertman and his wife did), then you will read this book without cringing. If, like me, you disagree with any of any of his very clear biases, then you will find his lack of journalistic objectivity disappointing."
3,More growth needed,"Although this book was fairly realistic in its depiction of addiction and its aftermath, where was Faith's support system? Nowhere in the book was Al-Anon mentioned. Even if she had chosen not to use this group, I have never read a novel about alcoholism where this is not discussed as an option for those affected by the alcoholic.""Hangover Soup"" was painful reading, especially its portrayal of Faith's ambiguity about her marriage and about Jay after the accident, the way she wavered, back and forth, and questioned herself. It is easy for a bystander to say ""throw the bum out"" but not so easy for those who are intimately involved in the situation. Faith was an addict too--she was addicted to Jay.Unfortunately, I did not feel that Faith had grown very much by the end of the book...she seemed to be in the same place where she was at the beginning of the story, despite the horrible things that happened."
4,Free SF Reader,"A nineteenth century nonconformist and activisit pulls a Rip VanWinkle, and wakes up a couple of centuries later. He discovers that heis now what he was actually agitating against, and is rather shocked.Wells was predicting the rise of the megacorporation, among otherthings, like the use of aeroplanes for travel. Most definitely acriticism of the large corporation way of life."
3,H.G. Wells Looks to Today,"When the Sleeper Wakes is one of the earlier works by H.G. Wells. Perhaps not as exciting as War of the Worlds or The Time Machine, it nonetheless imagines a future when big business runs the world and the two-party system is gone. Sort of like BP?Written in the late 1890s, the Wells book refers to aeropiles and aeroplanes. Sci fi lovers and H.G. Wells fans will discover much to consider."
3,worked for a little while,"This was given to us by our exterminator. It worked well for a while, then we started noticing the bait (pop-tarts, they love them!) was dissapearing with no mice in the trap. Upon closer inspection, I realized the little buggers had chewed a hole in the side and could come in for a snack and then leave. Now I use the metal one, although it seems some are able to escape that one too."
3,good hat a little tight,The Boonie ia a good quality hat but a little tight for the size. I have an other Boonie like this one and it is just a bit big. They both work fine.
2,"Good shoe, but narrow","A good shoe, as the title says, but so narrow that my son's normal-width foot is too wide. Disappointing for us, but probably good for kids with very slender feet."
4,"Invisible Ink books, picture is misleading!",The picture was a little misleading - shows 6 books but the price is for just one book and you are not able to specify which one you want. I now have to order more as I thought I was ordering 2 packs of 6 books. Think they are great - just wish I had known that is was just one book.
5,Fun,"We bought these for my wife while we were traveling. She really enjoys these kinds of games, especially while relaxing by the poolside."
3,Not their best but fine.,"It's an ok album, but if you're looking to find out what Phoenix is about then check out Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix and leave this one for another time."
3,dance & fun,"I guess you don't expect much of this album and indeed it's simply a dance & fun album, but for that reason it's quite good. Spanish fun tracks - different from each others, some nice samples and all in all a good soundtrack for your summer vacation"
4,Fun! Upbeat!,"This music will get you going... If you want to start the day off with energy or just plain start dancing, this music will do it! I use it to just put others into a positive mood or get them to change perspective. You can't remain upset after listening to this. My advice? Get it and start MOVING! Not for couch potatoes."
1,Los Lame-Os,"I remember back in the day I was chillin in bed, watching VH1 late at night, when the video for ""No Tengo Dinero"" came on. I was like, ""WTF is this? Who is that ugly mofo? Where did those strippers come from?"" For real, y'all. ""No Tengo Dinero"" is wack and so are the rest of the songs on this CD. I don't know what's up with all the 4-5 star reviews."
1,it was the wrong thing,i got a cd called earth sounds but what can i say look how much i payed for it. but still it was the wrong cd.
2,If you like spanish monkeys...,"If you like spanish monkeys and black rastafarian cowboys then this is the CD for you. I saw this video, which includes a celebrity cameo of Ron Jeremy, famous porn star, and no one believed me. No, there really is a black cowboy with a rastafarian accent and a monkey on TV, I proclaimed! Yet no one believed me. I give this CD two stars for comedy. And variety. Who would have thought a monkey and a black cowboy (and a porn star and two whores) could bring the world so much joy."
3,Why so expensive?,I got this for that one song. It was due mainly to nostalgia but I got it. The song itself is alright but the rest of the album is blah...
1,UGH!,There is no doubt in my mind that this is one of the WORST albums I ever bought! It is absolutely dreadful. It's not even really from Latinos. Terrible.
5,"Love it, love it!","This is a great movie! I saw it on tv and kept trying to find it again but never could so I decided to try and buy it, it is that good. It is funny, heart warming and so alive with culture. Love it!"
1,Think about it.,"This movie was linked to from the website of some little known singer Martita Roca. Problem is she is a member of the cult Growing in Grace,whose leader recently pro-claimed he was the anti-christ.This Roca person made the news today for getting 666 tatoed on her as tribute to her leader,just saying are these the type of people you want to support."
1,Gillian Anderson was the only thing worth seeing!,"Gillian Anderson was fabulous. The movie was horrible. No matter how well the other stars might've done, the movie was poorly thought up. Gillian's character was sweet, southern, innocent, and kind. She didn't have a big part, but her parts were memorable. If you're a Gillian fan, see it."
3,Rhe Turning,A simple plot. The major attraction is seeing Gillian Anderson in her debutfilm. On that she was good.
1,from nc,i was utterly repulsed the way people from my state are portrayed in this movie. yes there are people like that in this sate but they have all moved here in the last 15 years. if it weren't for a very brief alomst topless view of gillian anderson this movie would be worthless......sam felts
4,Good Value,"These briefs are a good value. The fit is good, the cotton material is comfortable, and they seem to be durable and well-made. I bought 3 packs of 3 briefs (black). So far so good after about 3 weeks. They look pretty good too."
3,Not so fast,"Based on the glowing reviews here, I bought 6 briefs as replacements for too-long-in-the-crotch old pairs from J.C. Penny. The 2Xist briefs do seem well made and fit well. BUT the V-shaped seams in back, holding a second layer of material, call attention to themselves. Particularly when I work up a sweat exercising, the briefs feel a bit diaperish. I won't buy more because of that feature, and potential buyers need to decide whether it's a virtue or a vice."
2,Rather complete package let down by sound quality.,"It's really a shame that this inexpensive speaker box does not have better sound quality, because the package is fairly complete. Battery or DC power, folds up for travel, decent (if a bit juvenile) looks, tiny remote control-- all the ingredients are there. It's just the sound quality at the end of the day that is inadequate. The frequency response is just a flat honk. No better than MacBook built in speakers really, just a bit louder. No bass whatsoever. Not even really any low midrange. I tried every EQ setting, even ""Latin"". Flat and featureless audio."
4,Forever Gold by Louis Armstrong,"This is a wonderful CD! It contains many of his popular tunes such as Mack the Knife, Hello Dolly, Cabaret and When the Saints. It is a live recording, so one has to put up with uneven sound; but the up side of that is you get the energy and spontenaity of a live performance. Many ""die-hard"" jazz fans will say he sold out to sing these popular songs, but I tell you this CD is uplifting and FUN!"
4,Coryn,Book Review:Chicken Soup for theChristian Teen SoulCoryn Henson7th5/19/05This book is so awesome. I love a lot it's one of my favorites! It's short stories are definitely page turner and I would recommend it to anyone. The stories are constantly talking about inspiration and hope.It doesn't matter your belief or religion it's still a good book and has good advice for anyone. The poems and stories and occasional bible verses really taught to believe in myself and to be confident and to appreciate life.I hope you enjoy reading and appreciating the meaningfulness of this book and if you enjoyed this book then you might enjoy reading Chicken Soup for the Christian Soul. There pretty similar but it's for all ages!
5,"""Chicken Soup"" Books Make Great Gifts","I have to start by saying that I love the ""Chicken Soup"" books.There are soooo many out there for so many different types of people. I bought this book as a gift for a family member. I couldn't help but read some of the stories before wrapping it. I may not be a teenager anymore, but reading the stories helped me remember to when I was. I think this book is not only great for teenagers, but perhaps the parents of teenagers as well."
1,CUT CUT CUT,"This is the USA censored version of ""Secrets of Sweet Sixteen"" cut by over 4 minutes, dialogue censored, ZOOM IN's to remove pubic hair, any ""radical political statements"" removed, etc etc etc, and horribly cropped on top and bottom from a washed out print. Plus a completely useless, uninformative commentary from what seems to be a bunch of drunks who know nothing about the film. The only way to see this film UNCUT and remastered is on a Dutch DVD which is quite difficult to find unfortunately."
2,Nebies only,"If you have never cooked a thing in your life and never heard of a microwave, this may the place to start."
2,"Slow, so very slow",Going into this I had no idea what to expect. Unfortunately I wasn't wowed by this movie. It was very slow and very predictable. You can look at this movie as a drawn out explanation of what NOT to do when you go into remote areas and what NOT to do when you find yourself stranded. Only mildly entertaining with very flat acting.
2,Dry,"This is one of those typical plot lines that goes around in circles. But to make matters worse it also jumps around, in dream stages that have no real meaning in the context of the movie. So if your into watching slow drawnout movies where people do get hurt n die, this is for you. If it's not your cup of tea, skip it. There are other much better movies out there."
1,Lacey! You Are Much Better Than This,It is so sad that actress Lacey Chabert has lowered herself to this level of film...if you want to call it that. I always thought she was a budding star and would emerge among the cream of the crop some day...definitely not in this dreadful low-budget bomb. It was slower than a crippled snail...horrible script...high school calibre acting. I hope Lacey emerges in a much better role. I won't hold this one against her. I'm her fan forever!
1,The only ones who will enjoy this are probably either Lacy Chabert...,"...or her friends and family. Seriously, I have seen nepotism at work in film...I have seen ""vanity projects""....this dreadful excuse for a movie takes BOTH of those concepts to a whole new level. I don't know who Lacy Chabert THINKS she is, but good God, not even Hollywood royalty could get away with this level of masturbatory self-aggrandizing. Basically, in a nutshell, here is all you need to know about ""Thirst"": everyone who is NOT Lacy Chabert is either a whore, a moron, an ass or some combination of all three and EVERYONE except Lacy Chabert's sweet little angel of a genius of a character DESERVES to die in horrible, horrible ways, sometimes at the hands of Lacy herself.SKIP THIS. It's not even worth the waste of time to watch it for free."
2,MAYBE SOMEONE WILL SEE THE FIRE,"This is a fairly cut and dry story. Two young couples go into a remote part of the desert to shoot photos of Mercedes McNab in a bikini and most of them don't make it out. Noelle (Lacey Chabert) is moody because she has morning sickness and is having second thoughts about the maturity of her boyfriend. She reminded me too much of my ex and I wanted her to shut up and die, while Mercedes reminded me of the woman I will only dream about. The film is compared to ""Open Water"" and indeed it is just as boring. This is a ninety minute movie that should take you 30 minutes to watch. We simply don't see enough of Mercedes McNab to save the film.No sex or nudity."
1,Just Awful,There are too many cliches in the terrible film. Starting with the blonde with fake boobs and moving on to the clueless guys and frigid worried woman. Ugh. Just terrible. Don't watch. I only watched because it was free with Amazon Prime.
3,Good man vs nature type movie,"I see half of the reviews for this movie are bad. Don't believe them, this isn't nearly a 1 or 2 star movie. Sure its not big budget, but it succeeds in what it sets out to do. It sets a very realistic portrayal of what could happen to you or I if somehow we were stranded in the desert with little to no water. Sanity is questioned, and desperation sets in. A tension filled movie, more psychological then physical. I enjoyed it."
5,There's A Stranger In My House... Maybe?...,"Okay, THE UNINVITED GUEST (EL HABITANTE INCIERTO) is one weird movie! It's certainly NOT your typical, Hollywood thriller. I sometimes wonder if America has forgotten how to make different, interesting movies. Anyway, this film is a grand example of taking a fairly typical premise- ""There's a lurker somewhere in my house!""- and turning it upside down, and inside out! I thought I had everything figured out a couple of times, and although I hit some points, I was twisted and flipped right along w/ the plot! Also, the ""hero"" of the story, is an emotional wreck / wimpy guy (Not exactly Jason Bourne in house-pants if you catch my drift!). This added to the suspense, since it made him more vulnerable and apt to mess things up. So, if you like crazy thrillers that don't answer every question in prefabricated style, then invite this GUEST in for the evening..."
5,Investment with BIG rewards,I am soooo pleased with my purchase. I want to buy more of this same book and share as gifts to others. MacArthur is annointed by the Holy Spirit and this book will not disappoint. Beautifully illustrated and filled with scriptures and easy to understand for children and adults alike!
3,+1/2 -- 60s garage meets '70s punk,"Though this isn't the lo-fi wonder of 2004's ""Rock 'n' Roll,"" this Boston, MA garage-punk band hasn't lost their edge in the studio upgrade. The album's filled with furious, raucous guitar, shouted vocals and tempos that will leave everyone sweaty by the end of the night. A cover of The Lime Spiders' ""Slave Girl"" is suitably menacing, and though the rhythm guitar riffs are occasionally a bit familiar, the band's combination of mid-60s garage and 70s punk bravura is a winner. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings. [2005 hyperbolium dot com]"
2,Epicenter? Not,"There are too things you need to know about this book: 1) it is written by a former, slighty disgruntled, employee who was just that, an employee, not an executive that can shed much light on the behind the scenes events that transformed Amazon into what it is today and 2) you need to tolerate Mr. Marcus' writing style as he loves to unnecessarily show off his extended vocabulary in sterotypical east coast elitist fashion.That being said, the book is an interesting, sometimes insightful journey from Amazon's yearly days up until the .com crash in 2000. Unfortunately the author's insight seems to be that of just another Amazon employee. Even though he was Amazon's 55th employee, he didn't even have the clout to get a meeting with Jeff Bezos to discuss the book. I got the feeling that the book could have been written by an Amazon janitor who was there during the early years.I don't know of a better book on the topic, but surely there must be."
3,Where's the beef,"As a book vendor to Amazon, I was keen to learn more about the company's formative years as well the inside scoop about the inner workings and politics of the current organization. Marcus writes about both issues, but for the most part he takes the high road and avoids kissing and telling. Can't blame the guy for still needing to use his former employer for references. Despite my wanting more, the book was an enjoyable, quick read. Marcus's discussion of the ""Culture of Metrics"", editorial objectivity being usurped by technology, and the true purpose and worth of coop dollars was refreshingly frank. Marcus is clearly a talented writer with a thorough knowledge of literature. At times this knowledge got in the way of story telling. For instance the chapter dedicated to Emerson bored me to tears. And I was an English major."
3,Representation of facts sacrificed to Marcus' literary ambitions,"I was interested in discovering more about Amazon's first years.Marcus provides interesting insights but sometimes he's pretty superficial on the ""facts"" and more focused on representing in an amusing way his personal experience within the company."
4,A look back at the halcyon early days of Amazon.com,"A brilliant insider account of what it was like to work at Amazon.com. The author was an early employee (55th) in the company and tells many interesting anecdotes from being called in to help package books in the warehouse to the introduction of user driven customized homepages and the waning influence of the editors at Amazon.com.The author has a friendly and humorous style of writing that makes you feel as though you are in conversation with him. A pleasure to read and also a quick read. Amazon.com's story is a remarkable one and this book gives an authentic, refreshing portrayal of all the fun and change of those times."
3,Well written and sometimes funny,"A talented writer with wit. I would have liked more info on Amazon's other businesses though. Still, very enjoyable. Someone needs to write the history of the Kindle."
4,Fascinating Read,"Amazonia: Five Years at the Epicenter of the DOT.COM Juggernaut by James Marcus was a fascinating read for me. I really enjoyed the inside look at how amazon grew from nothing to something that is now major for the history books. James takes us on a personal journey of his life which becomes intertwined with Amazon when he is hired on at Amazon in the early days.I now have adopted the ""Bezonian curveball"" to use when interviewing candidates and as an ice breaker when facilitating classes. If you are intriqued by this business or just the nature of business, then you will enjoy this book."
2,Rather Dissapointed,So I bought this for my green terror cichlids after reading that this is the best fish food brand you can get. So it came in today and my fish eat it like only 50% of the time. Otherwise they just spit it out and my pleco doesn't even eat it :( I guess i'll just go back to Hikari then.
1,Forever tarnished gold,"This is NOT the Drifters-- maybe it's ""The Drifter"" and a bunch of fill-ins. Bottom line is: these re-recordings are VERY bad! Don't waste your time on this one."
4,UV killer works... mostly,"So, only my cheap camo glows... the Cabelas stuff is fine. The UV killer definitely dims the glow and works great on normal fabrics, but it doesn't work well if the surface is absorbent, like fleece. I used half the bottle on one orange vest and gave up.No complaints on the sport wash yet."
5,I Must Have Gotten A Good One,"I was disappointed to see the other reviews of this product. I purchased it without reading any reviews and I've had no problems with it. I used it to check the temp of lemon curd. It's accurate and works fine. After reading the other reviews, I tried it on ice water and didn't have any problems. I do love the display. The big numbers are nice. It also has a nice feel in your hand."
1,Dead after the first week,"Bought this Taylor thermometer last year, it broke within days. Months later I bought another thermometer, and found out that it was the same model (by accident). The second one didn't survive a full week either. It's incredible that a manufacturer would sell such junk."
1,Excellent - for a 1 time use thermometer,"I've tried 2 of these thermometers, and the same results with both. They work great the first time you take it out of the package. But won't work after that.In both cases, I pulled the thermometer from the drawer for its second use, pressed the On/Off button and ""ON"" scrolls across the screen (normal so far). Only, instead of showing the temp, the screen flashes and ""ON"" scrolls across the screen. This continues, and there is now no way to turn off the thermometer or get it to respond in any way.Tried changing the battery in the first unit, and the only thing that accomplished was wasting a few bucks on a new battery. No change in (the lack of) performance.I tried emailing Taylor's customer service, and got no response (it's been 2 months now).I'd definitely stay away from this thermometer, and probably all Taylor thermos if this is supposed to be their ""higher end"" line."
2,You'd think a Taylor would be calibrated out of the box,"Well, mine wasn't. An extra hour of roasting later and my roast was still measuring less than 120 degrees, or barely rare. Unable to wait any longer, I pulled it, let it rest, and cut into it. It was almost past medium. This $20 thermometer nearly ruined a $208 prime rib. I am not a fan."
2,Fragile wires,"I had this for two years. Worked ok. I recommend setting the auto-off feature, or you will keep forgetting to turn it off.I had to change battery after 2 years. Taking it apart, I found one of the small white wires that lead down the probe broken. I replaced battery anyway, and it turned on and gave a reading. I put it back together thinking it apparently didn't need two wires; had to take it apart again to make sure I had the parts oriented right, and the 2nd wire broke. These are too small to easily repair.Warranty is 1 year."
2,Dud,"Didn't work. At first, all of the pixels flashed on and off. It wouldn't turn off. After a day or so, it stopped flashing. I assume that the battery finally gave out. Unfortunately, there was no information about the kind or number of batteries it uses and there were no instructions on how to change the battery. I was able to get one side to open but I couldn't get the other side to release so I was unable to get to the battery. I was able to get an RMA from the supplier but the effort and cost to get a refund hardly seemed worth it. Maybe one of these days I'll be able to get it open, change the battery and find out if it was any good. So I bought a mechanical meat thermometer at WalMart."
3,Slow,"This is an OK thermometer. I don't have reason to believe that it is inaccurate. It's just slow to use. I don't think a thermometer that takes 8 or 10 seconds per reading should be called ""Instant Read."" But whatever, maybe they're all like that.What is unacceptable is the animated display ... once you turn it on, the thermometer takes a good 5 seconds to tell you so by scrolling ""ON"" across the display. Same thing when you switch Fahrenheit/Celsius, which happens accidentally pretty often.I would probably not buy it again."
5,An Incredible Book,"This book literally blew me away. One of the most inspiring things I have ever read. By analyzing warrior cultures throughout history, The Code of the Warrior is an invaluable tool to teach people today what having a warrior code, or a virtuous code of ethics, is all about. You will walk away with a better understanding of the virtues of courage, integrity, loyalty, love, duty, honor and many others. And you will be inspired to develop your character to fight for what is honorable and true. An essential book for today's lethargic culture. If you want to develop your warrior potential and be a force in this culture for good, read this book!!"
3,Let's be realistic...,"Nice fairy tale :) I loved it, but check this out for a more realistic and in depth overview of a military culture:Men, Militarism, and UN Peacekeeping: A Gendered Analysis (Critical Security Studies). Enjoy the reading ;)"
2,Lint!,"The comforter looks great when you take it out, but it (and the sham) have a huge practical problem: the design is raised yarn that leaves lint on the dark blue background. After washing it, the lint was everywhere and hard to remove given the dark, solid color background. I would not have purchased it if I had known it is nearly impossible to clean!"
2,In play full comforter,"Compared to the pillowcases I received, the comforter looked faded, like it was used. Was disappointed in the appearance!"
5,A Beginners Guide to the Great War,"This book is great for the weekend historian or anyone with nothing more than a passing or general interest in the first world war. It provides a great ""high-level"" overview of the war. The book focuses more on military strategy and commanders than anything else, but it still provides a wonderful look into the war as well as a wonderful read!"
3,Overopinionated,"World War 1 by SLA Marshall was relatively well-written book from a literary perspective. However, several critiques stand out in fairly sharp relief. First, the author presents a cookie-cutter view of each of the major persons; uniformly he treats them as idiots without understanding or knowledge. Second, the author does not treat the social and political situation very well. In some areas, it is very nuanced, in some areas, it is written in a exceptionally blank and white situation. Third, he does not retain footnotes. While the material may be solid, having a full set of footnotes would aid in cross-referencing into other works on World War One.Generally I found this work to have a high bias heavily in favor of the enlisted man and slanted against the officers and politicians. While there was idiocy to go around, it would have been better to leave off the journalistic footnotes and comments in the op-ed of the newspaper instead of a history book."
5,Another masterpiece,"Frans Lanting does it again in Eye To Eye--a brilliant collection of intimate portraits and daily activities of various animals. Like Jungles, it's a book that no natural photographer should be without. When you can see the individual hairs in a courgar's fur coat, it makes you kind of wonder what it would be like to be that close to one.Looking at Lanting's work is always like looking through a book of artwork, as if he is the Picasso of photography and we are looking through his masterpieces."
2,"Good photos, awful printing","I had heard of Frans Lanting as an outstanding wildlife photographer and jumped at the chance to buy one of his books for a reasonable price. I would have expected maybe $40-$60 for a good coffee table book, and now that I've received the book I know why it was only $13: the print quality is just awful. Resolution is poor -- every photo looks blurred; there is not a sharp contour in any photo (seriously). Many photos have a reddish color cast. None of the images pop out of the page. Most are dark and have no detail in the shadows. Bottom line, every photo is dull and nearly lifeless, even though the subjects are anything but. I am sure this is not how they started out from Lanting's shots. As an amateur photographer who has spent considerable effort calibrating my workflow for color reproduction, I recognize many of these problems as basic issues that any decent photographic-oriented printer should have solved long ago. But maybe that is the reason the book is $13."
2,wrost print ever,"Poor author, Frans Lanting, who obviously put much effort in making stunning wildlife photographs...it must be really disappointing for him to see the terrible quality of reproductions of his pics. As already indicated by other reviewers, the surprisingly low price unfortunately reflects the surprisingly low quality of print...also, I have to agree, that there is not even a single photo which would be reproduced well. Sharpness, contrasts, color balance, etc...all bad in ALL(!!!) pictures. It is really pitty."
5,PPikacha,Stunning photographs. Great objects.....and photographic art is superb. A must purchase for all wildlife lovers.
5,Dazling!,"One of the best wild life photographers, Lanting sumarizes in this book 20 years of his experience. The result is astonishing! Besides, he is an example of someone that followed his dreams: he started as a photographer after he completed his PhD in Economics! An example to us all."
2,Didn't really care for this one,"I have tried many FIRM workouts and I consider myself to be a ""Firm Believer"". I got this workout in a box set of 3 (with Cardio Sculpt & Body Sculpt) and this one is my least favorite. I found it to be kind of boring and it didn't really challenge me. Afterwards I felt like I still needed to do another ab workout. I do not have abs of steel by any means. I have a LOOOONG ways to go before my abs are even near perfect, but I have other Firm videos that I feel give me a much better ab workout such as 5 Day Abs."
3,It's okay....,"But it isn't as challenging as it could be. Don't get me wrong, I still do this tape, but it just leaves something to be desired. It could be tougher, and it's not like I'm in super-great shape or anything (and, yes, I use proper form)."
3,Other Ab videos are better,"I prefer Karen Voigt's BLT (or any ab segment from her), Tamilee Webb's I Want Those Abs, or the Firm's 5 Day Abs. This is the longest of all those and the least difficult."
5,The Best Workout - EVER!,"I love the Firm workout tapes. I used them before my wedding trying to get fit. They really do work in 10 workouts or less! Once I had my baby, I started using them again, and with no doubt, they worked! This is the only workout that I really enjoy, I don't have to work out for 2 or 3 hours to get the effective results. I think about this workout when I'm not doing it, and I really enjoy it! I recommend this and any other tapes from the series to anyone. Trust me, you just put in the work, and the workouts do the rest! They're not easy, but they are effective!"
1,pathetic waste of $,"This piece of garbage was the worst ripoff I've ever come accross. I am convinced that all previous reviewers are somehow related to the author. There was not even 1 piece of valuable info in this pile of junk. The author simply points out the most basic concepts in real estate. The 1st 100 pages or so are dedicated to picking a good location, because real estate in good locations appreciates in value faster than other areas.... wow! what a concept! 100 pages to point this out? JUNK! Don't get ripped off by this poor excuse for a real estate ""expert"". There is no specific info in this book which could possibly be of help to anyone. Beware!!!"
1,Waste of money,"This should be a book about a *second* home. Presumably, the reader already has bought a first home. Or so I thought. The advice in this books is either (1) elementary real estate info that all homeowners understand or (2) simple common sense.I gave up when one piece of advice was ""Don't overpay.""Don't bother."
4,pretty doll,"the doll came in good shape, fast, it will be a great birthday gift. it is very pretty doll. much prettier than the New doll."
4,"Great doll, bad packaging",the doll came on time and it looked great the packaging was a little opened. it was fine i taped it back together.
2,Doesn't sound right,"I ordered this on Amazon and it arrived very quickly. It is a nice looking Chanter, but after doing some research it is probably overpriced for the money. It is comfortable to hold and play, but the sound was never quite right. And then the reed fell apart after only a few days. However, I am in the process of ordering a new reed and I am hoping that, with a higher quality reed, it will play better. Otherwise, I spent 90 bucks on a conversation piece for my coffee table."
3,Breakable Flaps,"I bought this book because I thought it would be perfect for my 1 yo grandson who loves to open and close doors and turn the pages of books. He promptly broke several of the flaps. I bought this book used, so it was only three dollars with free shipping, but I wouldn't want to have paid full price for this item. He does, however, love this book, so I'm reasonably happy with the purchase."
1,Copy of Illinois Grand Lodge Blue Book,"This is nothing more than an illegal copy of the copyrighted Illinois Grand Lodge Blue Book.The pages are either photocopied or retyped onto full sized, 8.5 x 11, paper and the print takes up only 20% of the space of the page. The rest of the page is white.Shame on the publisher for allowing this book to be printed and sold!"
3,LOOK TO THE EAST,"SOME GOOD INFO.FOR A NEW MASON,TO LEARN HOW SOME THINGS 'ARE' THIS IS ONLY GENERAL INFO,SOME YES SOME NO,,GOOD READ ,WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO THINK OF ABOUT MASONS...DON'T BELIEVE ALL YOU READ..MASONS ARE GREAT PEOPLE,WHO DO GOOD FOR ALL AMERICANS....."
3,It's In The Title,"It ain't Duncans, but it ain't bad. It's been around for ages, so that says a lot for any book. Hats off to the publisher. Many lodges just want something to keep the craft on their toes and govern their ritual cirriculum accordingly. Thus, Look To The East demands from Freemasons at least an attentive ear by dint of its compelling title alone. And because of that, an aura of respect and obligation hovers about it.Look To The East is a good work, good for the fraternity. It's a blue house ritual, and no such lodge can really operate without one. But, in my opinion, the book owes its fraternal popularity to its title and not so much to its contents, which offer nothing exceptionally different from some of the other Masonic rituals in its class. But it remains an overall good and useful tool for the craft."
1,Look to the East,This book did provide any detailed information of the craft that I was looking for. Very General.
5,Unveiled at Last!,I have been looking for a book like this for a long time - one that doesn't skirt around the edges of what Freemasonry is but really gets inside the mysteries and practices. What a great find. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the esoteric mystery cults or are just plain curious!
4,an ok re-do,"This group of three girls were meant to be the ""New Supremes"", but they flopped in Europe. Anyway, their singles and their album are quite enjoyable. It's good and steady soul music with fine voices and has more than just Supreme-Cover-Songs"
3,Mysticism of the West,"Written by a true Adept of the Western Mysteries, this book explores several central doctrines of the mystic tradition as expressed in the Rosicrucian lineages. A great ""seed"" book for meditations and inspiration along the Path."
5,So Satisfied,Very quick delivery. The band is smooth and the rose is lovely. Very comfortable and very pretty.Edited to add: 5/23/2010I get more compliments on this ring than anything else. I've worn this ring every day since I received it (gone through the wash a few times too) and it's still gorgeous. I'm so glad I got this ring.
1,Misshapen and odd looking,The ring I got was very off kilter and looks odd. In looking back at the picture it does show a rather large base on one side. From the angle of the picture it is hard to tell that the ring is not symmetrical below and above the rose. The one I got just looks like there is a big blob of silver to one side. It's a bummer.
5,Sterling silver rose ring - size 9,This is a beautiful little ring that I bought since my middle name is Rose. It is cute and a nice addition to the jewelry I own.
4,love it,"I wear my ring every day and have gotten many compliments! This was exactly what I was looking for, at a great price, and I receieved it just a couple days after I ordered. I would definitely order from Silver Insanity again."
4,A thing of beauty....joy forever!,"Rose is my flower. I am happy to choose this ""Detailed Rose"" ring for myself which I never took off once I recieved. Its a pleasure to look at and a treasure to own."
2,Rose ring far undersized,Rose ring was extremely small. It could only be used as a pinky ring. I should have returned ring for reimbursment.
5,Love it!,I ordered this ring out of a whim and I couldnt be happier with my purchase. I wear the ring all the time and its the perfect size. I recommend this ring to anyone who loves true beauty.
4,stones are amazing,"It fit perfect and the stones are amazing. The pics here don't do it justice. I own a lot of real, fine jewelry and my friends thought this was an expensive designer purchase! I love it!"
5,so pretty (:,This ring is so pretty. It's very tiny and suddle. I've never seen another ring like it. I'm actually wearing it now (: I have no complaints. Its great quality and all.
5,Rose ring,"The rose ring I ordered is so pretty. Without all the pretentiousness of a stone, it is easily recognizable as a rose. I've never seen anyone else wear one and I am really happy with it."
1,Horrible company - Thieves,I ordered this item. But was shipped some random pendant. The have failed to respond to multiple emails asking them to correct the problem. Luckily I was fortunate not to make a large purchase with them. Would not do business with these theives again.
3,Sea shell art.,"I guess as posters go, these posters are good. They were just not what I had expected them to be. The ad could have stated that these posters are not framed."
3,"Supports the ""Great Man"" theory of Russian history","This book buys right into the theory that Russians are incapable of self-government and require a tyrannical dictator to haul them into order. Sheesh.This is a 1986 book by Diane Stanley, and I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. Like all her books, this one is magnificently illustrated in the style of the time and place -- breathtaking illustrations on every page are more than worthwhile.However, it is this kind of reading of Peter the Great forcibly modernizing a backward and reluctant traditional people that led to Stalin... and Putin.Don't give a boost to history's bad guys by telling them people are incapable of self-rule."
3,Still Better Than Most,"I think this is the only Marti Jones disk I have not reviewed on this site (untrue - 'Unsophisticated Time; isn't even listed to review).While certainly not a horrible record, I just find it did not measure up to Jones' first three efforts. The elements are there: good vocals, songwriting, production - but something just misfires (like the cover of Any Trouble's ""Second Choice"").All the songs work on an individual basis, but as a group they aren't very cohesive. Jones and Don Dixon started taking on more of the songwriting duties, and though they are good, maybe the selection wasn't all it could be.I'll admit this isn't one of the Jones disks I listen to a lot. I did in the '90s, but it hasn't been one I pull back out. That being said, and I've said it in other reviews: it's still better than 90% of what's out there.If you can find it - I'd never not recommend picking up a disk by Marti Jones."
5,You will fall in love with this cd,"From beginning to end this cd is absolutely great, had this cd for years and every time i hear it, it seems like a new cd. Outstanding!!!!!!"
5,"Small price, big savings",This simple tool works great for around the house. Why spend big unless you are a contracter. This will help save you money.
4,"Very Nice, HD perfect, Standard not great","I got a great deal on this TV, and do think it was worth it. I love the size, and the HD picture is fantastic. I did not have any trouble with buzzing, and I just have the TV plugged into a regular power strip. The standard channels are quite a bit grainy. But I have no real comparison for this. I assume most LCD and Plasma sets have this issue? Anyway, the set is spectacular looking, and versatile. Great features, and great HD picture. If that is what you are looking for, it is worth it."
5,Excellent exercise!,"I needed to find something to do indoors because I'm stuck at home with 2 young children or have to walk very slowly when I do go out with them. I considered buying a treadmill (expensive!), and thought I'd try this walking dvd instead. Am I ever glad I did!I don't have the walk-away belt and bands which reviewers here said aren't really necessary. However, she does go on about HOW GREAT the belt is that I finally just went out and got a wide elasticized band to wear while doing the moves. Even without resistance bands, my arms get a real workout and I can feel my abdominal muscles working right along with everything else.At no point am I gasping for breath, and the mile meter which says how far you are in the workout really does motivate you. This is a dvd that anyone can follow, and it's MUCH better than a walk around the neighbourhood (which is what I had always aimed to do before I became slowed down by my two little ones.)This is definitely a keeper for me!"
5,Leslie Sansone - Walk Away the Pounds for Abs - 3 Mile,"I love it! I have the Walk Away the Pounds - 2 mile tape & it wasn't challenging after 1 year. I was definitely ready to move up to the next level. It's just the challenge I need for right now. I was only doing the exercises 3 times a week, but have stepped it up to 4-5 times a week."
5,ANOTHER WINNER !,"I love this one and always get a good sweat. It's about 45 minutes long, very motivating, and simple. The pink set added a nice and calming touch to the workout. Instead of the walkaway belt, I use 2 lb hand weights. I love it! Get it and get fit! I don't think you'll be sorry!"
3,Not able to maximize workout.,"The walking program is very good, but in order to maximize the workout for ABS (which is why I purchased it) a belt is needed. This piece of equipment is not pictured, or mentioned on the cover. Without the belt it's just another DVD for walking."
4,Great,I am very pleased with my order however I did not recieve the bands that were said to come with it. Walk away the Pounds for abs was recomended by a friend because of the bands that make the work-out more intense. Other wise LOVE IT
5,Gang Starr is again at the top their game.,"Gang Starr's ""Moment of Truth"" is a Hip-Hop classic in the making. Guru and Premier are at there best, with tight beats and intelligent, solid lyrics, ""Moment of Truth"" should be a staple in any Hip-Hop collection. Gang Starr always seam to top themselves and they've surely done that here. Along with this album make sure you pick up Gang Starr's four other classic albums. ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"", ""Daily Operation"", ""Step into the Arena"", and ""Hard to Earn."" Do yourself a favor and buy this right now."
5,A Bright Shine From The Starr,This album is one of the bests albums released in 1998. Guru and Premier keep it real and stay on focus of what real hip-hop is about. They keep emceeing and djing a part of hip-hop and thats a part that has been in lacking in the commercial industry.
5,Nice,This is a wicked album. Guru back with a vengence drops nice lyrics to a heavy flow and positive group. This is true hip hop. They should have gotten more play in 98.
4,Worth Picking Up,"Moment of Truth is the first gangstarr album i picked up after downloading ""skillz."" the strength in this album lies not in its lyrics, flows, or in its beats, but in its prodcution. it is one of the cleanest sounding albums ive heard in underground in a long time.guru's flows are slow but melodic. however, he sometimes becomes unoriginal in his rhymes, and sometimes, albeit rarely becames bungled in his flow. however some tracks are nearly flawless...which redeems the whole album.premier comes with some original beats unlike much out there. production is the key and obviously moment of truth is chock full of it.BOTTOM LINE: worth picking up"
5,Moment Of Truth: A Classic,"""Moment of Truth"" is a rediculously great album! It is everything I look for when I purchase a hip hop CD. Guru is an intelligent rapper that is good at what he does. His rhyme flow is phenomenel. Primo is an outstanding DJ and creates beats that are always enticing. My favorite tracks are: You Know My Steez, Royalty, Above the Clouds, and Rep Grows Bigga. This album is a masterpiece."
4,"Gang Starr, nice album but.....","True hip hop for the most part. A real nice album with the exception of that some of the guests don't represent with the same fire power that Guru does on each and every track. Most tracks are nice with the exception of ""the mall."" This album would get 5 stars if it weren't for weak showing by some featured guests."
1,This book only contains sample tests.,"This book only contains sample tests, with NO explanations of the answers. It is very misleading to say that this book helps ""prepare"" you for the tests. The ""cassette"" that ""comes with the book"" is actually a coupon that you mail in with $7.95 to get the cassette. The title ""Everything you need to score high on Praxis II"" and the publishers' description of the book (parroted by Amazon.com) are fraudent. I felt that I was ripped off when I bought this book. One would be better off getting the sample test booklet sold by ETS."
1,Little You Need to Know,"I bought this book to prepare for the school psychology speciality exam. It was useless for this purpose. The mock school psychology exam provided no explanations for the answers, nor did it mimic the actual exam offered by ETS in length or content. I ended returning the book to Amazon.com; it contained nothing that helped me prepare for exam that I had not already garnered from the ETS materials available for free."
5,National Treasure / National Treasure 2 - Book of Secrets [Blu-ray],This was a great deal for Blu-ray discs. The entire family enlyed both movies. delivery was prompt as the movies arrived 2 days prior to the estimated date on receipt.
5,very pleased,the item came in a timely fashion it was well packaged and in perfect condition. great value as well.
5,blue Ray DVD,Amazon price was great and they got the DVD to me before the schedule day.I order from here all the time and will continue to do so.
5,Good clean fun for the family.,"I am a history buff, a Nicolas Cage fan, and an adventure lover. These are great movies that the entire family can enjoy. Historical inaccuracies aside, the bottom line is that they are just fun. A cleaner version of Indy Jones really. Don't get me wrong, nothing compares to Indy, but those movies with their adult jokes, flirting, and scary voodoo aren't really child appropriate, so it is cool to have similar movies we can all view together."
5,National Treasure 1,Quality of the Blu Ray on NT one is not very good. It is the same as a normal DVD. National Treasure 2 has great quality. Both movies are great entertainment
5,Like a cold shower on a hot summer day,"You know books, right? Those things with the words? Well, you like books, right? That's why you're here, ya? Well, you'll like this one. The sex is steamy (and bizarre), the characters quirky, and the prose...well, that's just an extra pat of butter on the buttermilk biscuit that is this book. Get it. I say so."
1,Disappointed,This product isn't worth the few dollars to spend on it. Its material is hard to use and dies not make for a good finished product. The instruction pack does not match the actual product.
1,Disappointed...,"No color guide....yarn is of an extremely poor quality...hard to follow instructions...would not recommend especially if you are a seasoned ""needlepointer"" as am I...."
5,Wonderful,"I start my day with this CD. Ryan Smith has captured part of the essence of the worship experience using unique and beautiful arrangements of the old wonderful hymns we love. This CD is a heartwarming and uplifting experience. When I gave it to a friend, also a pianist, he was impressed with the skill and sensitivity of the arrangements and the playing."
2,Be serious!,"Let's get right to the point, it sucked! The Rock as a Homo? Dwayne Johnson, are you that desperate for money? Please don't do any more movies like this! You've been warned!"
1,Disc was stolen!!!,"I am not able to provide a review; when I received my shipment from Amazaon, the disc was missing from the Be Cool package! I was livid!!!! This is the first time I ordered movies from Amazon; I will think twice about ordering again."
2,more dud than cool,"I usu. write about music or movies that I really like...but I didn't like Be Cool. I like comedy, action, fun, even stereotypes, but Be Cool is just too much weak stuff, seen it before, not original, not gut-bustin comedy. Even the stereotype-characters are a dud; if it's been done before then change something!..to make it fun or interesting. Steve Tyler?...nah...his daughter maybe.They could have salvaged the flick by having more of sexy Christine Millian as a super hoochie or bitchy vixen in patent leather, at least get a thrill with her.Compared with say, Players Club, & Undercover Brother: both of those are also full of stereotypes & stuff we've seen before, but those two do it right, excellent movies full of action, comedy, soft & hard stuff, vixens."
1,Uneven and Very Disappointing!!,"I was disappointed with the original ""Get Shorty"" as I thought the film was supposed to be very funny, but it wasn't. Its the same thing with this sequel. There are very few laughs and it seems to be too cute for its own good. It wants us to get in on the little hints such as the dance scene reminicent of the pairing on ""Pulp Fiction"". Travolta and Thurman are totally wasted. We're also are supposed to be amused by ""The Rock's"" eyebrow raising. Vince Vaughn also tries to humor us, but fails to impress. But this movie just doesn't cut the mustard. It's too long, unfunny and uneven. They should have worked on more laughs, just like I said with the original. Stay away! Go directly to jail! Do not pass go, do not pick up $200 dollars!"
2,Hard to say,"I don't like giving such a low rating, but I would like to add a half to my 2 stars. The reason it received more than one was because of the Rock and Cedric the Entertainer.In general, the movie was all over the place. Not in a creative Tarantino way but in a disjointed, several-stories-going-everywhere-way. And what about the characters from Get Shory, we saw Devito's character, but what about Renee Russo? They had Chili doing too much of the same thing over and over again(e.g.""Look at me!"") and it just got played out. I don't want to give the movie away, but there were some characters, scenes, and plots they could have seriously cut out.Lastly, I like some of Christina Milian's music, but the story around her made the movie look like a personal career booster.Compared to Get Shorty, Be Cool lacks the smoothness, subtlety, and overall coolness that made the story short, sweet , and right to the point.P.S.-The ROCK IS HOT!!"
1,Seriously?,"I started watching this movie not knowing it was the sequel to Get Shorty. With the introduction of Chili Palmer and him staring the Russian hitman in the face, I was expecting another good movie. I was sadly mistaken. I feel as if Elmore Leanords's legacy is tainted.All this movie offers is an allstar cast. With John Travolta and Uma's dance scene I'm reminded of Pulp Fiction. The director couldn't even get that right. At the end when the singer wins the MTV award and the RZA and Fred Durst are shown, i realized the awful ploy of the movie. Fred Durst was funded and brought up by the same people who own MTV. This movie is a terrible attempt to appeal to middle schoolers and any other person who relies on MTV to tell them what is hip."
3,Rent before you buy!,"This is definately a movie to get at the video store before you drop $20 to buy it. The plot of the film is very weak. It's basically just a fight over a rising diva's singing contract. The best part of this movie is that it is chock full of stars. You've got to love a movie that has Steven Tyler not only singing in it, but sort of ""acting."" For his first time on the big screen, he wasn't all that bad. Another great part of the movie is The Rock. His character, a (...) bodyguard, is an absolute riot! This film, however, relies too much on its star power instead of an actual storyline."
5,It's what you want in a Comedy,"I won't waste your time with trying to make a bunch of pretentious comparisons with other films as you're only reading this so you can make a ""buy or not"" decision. This comedy is what comedys are supposed to be--an entertaining way to spend some time and it does exactly that--I laughed through most of it-not necessarily just the plot and lines as presented but at the funny Hollywood references throughout the film and who was casted for what part. An incredibly talented cast in a very entertaining comedy. A good addition to any collection."
3,Don't Mess with the Best,"In a documentary on Disc Two of the Special Edition of GET SHORTY, we learn that director Barry Sonnenfeld allowed his actors no latitude for improvisation when it came to altering the dialogue of the master, Elmore Leonard. Travolta lauds this technique.In a documentary among the special features on the BE COOL DVD, everyone, including Travolta, lauds the fact that the director encouraged them to improvise and ad lib as much as they pleased.This is why, while a fun film, it falls far short of SHORTY. When you're dealing with source material by Elmore Leonard, you should stick with it, for his dialogue is nonpariel.Good, but not great. High praise for The Rock, however. He makes it worth seeing."
1,Tremendous disappointment,"What is wrong with some moviemakers these days? I used to get angry at critics for constantly falling back on films pre-80's as anything of any value but now I'm starting to see their point. Everything looks like it was made by MTV studios lately...Chili Palmer was a supercool tough guy in Get Shorty. All of a sudden Cedric the Entertainer and his ""posse"" of idiots has Chili by the balls? What gives? If Chili talked trash in GS he backed it up - now he sells out to this hip hop culture crap. Are you serious??However, Christina Millian is flat acting wise but she sure is nice to look at."
1,IT WAS HORRIBLE,BE COOL WAS HORRIBLE I DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL!JOHN TRAVOLTA COULD HAVE DONE BETTER!FROM KIRSTEN
1,BE CORNEY.....,"Wow, this movie was so bad it made me laugh. All the hollywood stars making cameos made it that much more of a train wreck. If you want to see a movie with big name actors in it that is actually funny then watch Team America: World Police!"
3,Be Cool,"Streetwise mobster-turned-movie producer Chili Palmer is back, but this time Chili has abandoned the fickle movie industry and veered into the music business, tangling with Russian mobsters and gangsta rappers and taking a talented, feisty young singer named Linda Moon under his wing. From the recording studio to an Aerosmith concert to the MTV Music Awards, he manipulates events to watch them play out the Chili way, using his signature blend of wiseguy skills and negotiation tactics. It's a dangerous business, and everyone's looking for their next big hit. Be Cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy."
2,"The Rock and Andre 3000 characters were great, the rest...","Was pretty much trying to capitolize off the funny parts/characters from the first one. Even the new faces were still pretty much the same characters from Get Shorty. Hell, even a good portion of the plot was taken from Get Shorty.The Rock's character, however, was great! It was the perfect role for him, I just wish it would have been in a better movie. The satire based on his wrestling persona was priceless, and the homosexual angle had me in tears several times. Andre 3000 was good too, I could see him with a decent career in mainstream comedic roles."
3,High Potential but No Punch.,"This sequel to Get Shorty had high hopes and really tried to be funny and poignant at the same time, but when you get Steven Tyler of Aerosmith to act, there is trouble in the air. The worst lines and acting job I have ever seen. The movie, however was not a total dissapointment. Cedric the Entertainer as a Gangster mob boss/record producer had its moments. And Uma Thurman and John Travolta's interactions were pretty good, reminiscent of ""Pulp Fiction"". Maybe a little more plot and substance might have made this a good movie. I enjoyed some of the scenes with Vince Vaughn, Harvey Keitel and the Rock as a ""gay bodyguard"". Vince Vaughn,s attempt to be a black pimp was hilarious if not a little over the top. This movie could have been a lot better if the writers had paid more attention to details of plot and less to ""hit and miss"" punch lines. Worth a look but promises to dissapoint if you are looking for another ""Get Shorty""."
3,"Be Cool, it's lukewarm","Not the same snap and fizz the first one, ""Get Shorty"", had but still well worth a look. The casting is great but the story about the record industry although adequate doesn't seem as edgy and believable. I don't know if that is because Gene Hackman was more believable or the story was better in the first. Maybe this felt to much like the first ones overall premise of wiseguys being outdone by Chili Palmer, played by John Travolta again. Certainly worth seeing but I would recommend renting before buying. Good quality DVD with some replayability. - C. Luster"
2,What A Disaster,"Sometimes when I hear an A-list cast will be bunched up together for 2 hours in a movie I hope that it is good, not for the sake of 2 hours, but for the sake of these actors' careers. In the case of ""Be Cool"", everything went to waste.Everything about this film was a big question mark. The first 10 minutes of the movie makes fun of sequels and pg-13 movies. These are the 2 reasons the movie is so bad. They constantly reference a movie called ""Get Leo"" which is the movie-in-a-movie version of get shorty.I question anyone's taste who actually thought this was good."
2,"See ""Get Shorty"", skip the sequel","Although ""Get Shorty"" is one of my favorite movies, this tepid sequel lacks much of the wit and originality that made the first one so good. It looks like too many of the sequels from the '80s: very similar plot in a slightly different setting with slightly different characters. As much as I like all of these actors, it felt like they were just going through the motions on this one. I also think the movie suffers from an overabundance of bit parts just so they could squeeze in some more recognizable names and faces. The only bright spot was relative newcomer Christina Milian, who can not only sing but actually looked like she was having fun with it. It's because of her that I am giving this two stars instead of one. Overall this movie was a couple of hours of mild, mindless entertainment, but that's all it was."
2,Lame sequel,"You know a movies bad when The Rock is the best thing in it.Be Cool is nowhere as good as Get Shorty.Most of the actors seem to be sleepwalking thru their performances.The changes from the book dont help either.Whereas Linda Moon in the novel was more of a Lucinda Williams,Sheryl Crowe type the movie has turned her into a generic R & B singer with the typical over produced well done but instantly forgettable songs that pass for modern R & B.Rent Get Shorty instead."
2,I WONDER WHAT ''GET SHORTY'' WAS LIKE,"CHILI PALMER [JOHN TRAVOLTA, ALWAYS PUTTING IN A GOOD PERFORMANCE AS ALWAYS] DECIDES TO LEAVE THE MOVIE BUSINESS FOR THE MUSIC BUSINESS. HE DISCOVERS AN UNKNOWN FEMALE SINGER NAMED LINDA [CHRISTINA MILLIAN] AND HE TRYS TO GET HER SIGNED TO ATL RECORDS, WHICH IS OWNED BY THE NEWLY WIDOWED EDIE [UMA THURMAN]. SOME FUNNY MOMENTS CAN BE FOUND IN THIS MOVIE, BUT THE MOVIE SUFFERS FROM BEING A LITTLE TOO LONG AND IT ALSO SUFFERS FROM TOO MANY BORING MOMENTS. IN ADDITION TO JOHN TRAVOLTA, THE ROCK [PLAYING A GAY BODYGUARD!], VINCE VAUGHN [PLAYING A WANNABE BLACK EXECUTIVE], AND CEDRIC THE ENTERTAINER [PLAYING A GANGSTA RAP PRODUCER] ALL HELP TO SAVE THIS FILM."
2,Elmore Leonard wrote a much better book,"This movie deviated considerably from the book ""Be Cool"". In so doing it lost much of the suspense, intrigue and humor of the book. Elmore Leonard is one of my favorite authors and I have read every one of his books in the ""crime and suspense"" genre. I have also seen all of the movies made based on his books. This movie is the weakest adaptation of all. I was really disappointed that many of the characters were left out of the movie who added so much depth and life to the book. Trying to replace a cop that Chili befriended with an anonymous sidekick was lame. If you enjoyed this movie then you would love the book. If you hated the movie you would still love the book if you like this genre."
3,"decent movie, but","Its supposed to be light-weight.Duh.Its fun. The rock rocks.At the beginning, the guy dropped 8 rounds. A Glock has way more than that (it looks like a Glock; if its a Beretta, my bad). Poor production (throughout lol).damn Uma can dance.BTW, the Rock Bwayne Johnson) is a natural. But I'd kick his ass any day but Sunday. :)"
2,where's the beef ??,"I gave this movie two stars only because I am an avid John Travolta fan, and Chili Palmer is one cool cat. Get shorty, is one of my favourite J.T. movies and that's why I feel let down by this empty sequel. It's true that in the past Travolta has made some questionable film choices (or maybe his agent has) but this movie is all salad. A Long, drawn out, 2 hr collection of boring musical performances, highlighted by a handfull of great moments delivered by a chosen few(Travolta, Andre, Cedric and the Rock). Too much bun and not enough burger."
2,only an idiot would give this movie 5 stars,This movie sucked...the only entertaining thing was Vince Vaughn and The Rock...Cedric the Entertainer played the big bad gangster (could they have found a more NON-threatening black guy?)...and why is he in so many movies? Cedric the Mediocre is more like it. Even more overrated than him is John Travolta...yeah he was OK in pulp fiction but damn can somebody please retire him again?
2,Disappointing sequel,"""Be Cool"" is a disappointing sequel to 1995's ""Get Shorty"", a clever, funny satire of mobsters, mayhem and the movie business. Both movies are based on novels by acclaimed crime author Elmore Leonard.In ""Get Shorty"" gangster Chili Palmer comes to Hollywood to collect a debt and ends up falling in love with the movies. In ""Be Cool"" he has become a big Hollywood producer who is now bored with it all. After a friend in the music business is murdered, he becomes involved in a war between various factions of hip hop music. Along the way be becomes involved with a beautiful woman and guides to career of a talented young singer.The movie's big problem is that the satire is not fresh. The jokes about movie sequels, stars and hip hop music aren't that funny. Even the in jokes about Travolta and costar Uma Thurman's movie classics don't work.Rather than buying or renting ""Be Cool"" [which isn't], I suggest you reach for ""Get Shorty"" [which is]."
1,I give it 1 star because they won't let me give it 0.,"The most extraordinary thing about this movie was how boring it actually managed to be. Having seen Get Shorty already, I went in with low expectations, but it couldn't even deliver on those. I can only suggest this movie to those who really can enjoy laughing at how bad a film is. If you're thinking that Vince Vaughn will save it for you, I'm sorry, but he can't."
1,ANY THING BUT COOL!,"What's worse than a s#@!^y low budget movie?A s%*&#y big budgetmovie!This movie just straight blows!I thought KRAFT had a lotof cheese but this takes the cake, from the stilted directionto the mugging of the screen,to Uma Thurman's dialog(just tellme that dream on is not the greatest rock'n'roll song ever made.I'll tell ya!Right in your face,god that made me sick)it's onething to see a movie and say that just sucked!But it's anotherwhen you see a movie and it makes you angry,like this pile ofS#*T!The biggest reason why I'm angry is I think John Travolta,Uma Thurman,Vince Vaughn,Steven Tyler & The Rock have all donesomething I've enjoyed from one time to another,but this?I'drather watch Police Acadamy 12.Best scene,when the ending credits came up.Total trash avoid at all cost."
4,Funny,Saw this movie on cable and it was so funny to my fiance' and I that I went to Amazon and bought it. I do not think you will be disappointed if you buy it.
1,QUITE POSSIBLY THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!,"I kid you not. I loved get shorty and went to see this with my girl in the theater, less than halfway through i wanted to walk out but my girl wouldnt let me. She agreed that the movie was awfull but didnt want to just give away our 20 bucks to see it.The only truly funny charter in the movie is the gay bodyguard played by the Rock. Other than that lammer than lame. They even do a 10 minute dance scene for no reason than to fill up space.DO NOT BUY IT HORRIBLE!!!!!!!"
1,This movie is really bad!,"Bad acting, phony characters, idiotic plot, this movie takes the cake. I dub it ""the worst movie of 2004."" Don't waste you're time"
3,"""I said what if this movie was cool""","I, having seen the movie Get Shorty and having loved it, was excited about this movie. That was until I saw the lame previews. The Rock didn't look funny nor did Vince vaughn but I decided to give it a shot. I was right. It was a major letdown with some good laughs but the movie seemed boring, stupid, and just weird at times. The Rock playing a gay bodyguard wasn't funny, Vince Vaughn acting black wasn't funny, and the rest of the cast wasn't that good either. The movie has an all star cast with over 10 actors I'm very familiar with. That's weird but cool. But, it just wasn't funny. The plot is about Chili Palmer who leaves the Movie business for the Music business. He then finds a good prospect in a young singer. The movie has some good laughs but mostly nothing. If you want to laugh, watch get shorty and not this. Believe me, it's not funny."
2,a missed opportunity,i've never viewed a film in my life that had so much on screen talent with no place to go. the magic that these actors have been known to make is invisable in this morass. don't waste your time even when it shows up on HBO or late night viewing.
1,"Actually, no stars...","This is the worst movie ever made. And not in a cheeky way. Bad movies can be fun. This aint one of them. It's just awful in every way. And disappointing. Get Shorty was a home run. They put together another great cast for the sequel; they had another great Elmore Leonard story. Then: the adaptation sucked. The direction blew. The actors phoned it in. And the production team couldn't capture that twinkle imperative to an Elmore Leonard story. Your time's better spent re-reading the book. Or, for that matter, banging your head against the wall."
1,Whoa...don't waste your time or money.,I rented it. I did something I seldom ever do. I turned it off about 1/2 way through. I couldn't watch anymore.
1,"In A Word, Terrible!","With all the notable names in the film, it was hard to believe that it would be so bad. Poorly acted, poorly written, a poor waste of time. ****When I die, Im gonna petition God to get my 90 minutes back that I spent watching this!**** I mean the plot was so poorly developed, and all the characters were so out of place! I will not ""spoil"" it for those that have not seen it. It suffices to say, the ""best parts( if there were any) were in the trailers advertising this movie. Its all downhill from there people."
2,The reason to watch: Vince Vaughn as a pimp/producer/manager,"There is one reason and one reason only to see Be Cool: the outrageous performance of Vince Vaughn as Roggie, a would-be music producer/manager who thinks he's black. Seriously. Between the Burberry jogging suits, gold chains, played out slang, and Pimps Up Hoes Down attitude I was almost amused enough not to notice that the rest of this movie was absolute [..]. Almost, but not quite.So if you're going to watch this movie, go ahead and fast forward to all the scenes with Roggie because the rest of it is more or less useless. That's my two cents."
2,Yeah,"Yeah, unfortunatly, this movie is LAME! Get Shorty was much better. But It's ok to watch if Iyou have seen Get Shorty first, and or have ""realy!"" nothing better to do.., and you should see it first before you buy.."
1,How un-original!!,"I can't beleive how many blatant rip-offs there were in this film from the legendary ""Get Shorty"". I bought the special edition of Get Shorty that had the free ticket to Be Cool in it. I have been a huge Shorty fan for years and have read many Elmo books. The book ""Be Cool"" was somewhat of a dissappointment, but I figured that Travolta would be able to resurect this in film format. Wrong! It felt like he had a gun to his head to do this film.....if I had to hear ""Look at me"" one more time, I was gonna shoot myself!From character ripoffs to lines, I feel like they should have left Get Shorty alone instead of trying to ""Cookie-cutter"" it into the sequel. Bad job! It has actually hurt Get Shorty some!!"
2,Bleh,"This is one of those movies you rent just to keep up with the Smiths down the street.Personally I found the movie rather dry and irritating. The movie carried a certain smugness that made me want to reach though the screen and punch John Travolta in the face. The movie fails to really come alive, it just kind of drags until it collapses into itself."
4,Hilarious,"I don't understand the poor reviews of this movie. I thought it was hilarious, and the second half of it was just as funny as Get Shorty. Plus, this is one of the few instances when the movie is actually better than the book. I didn't like the ending of the book, where Linda Moon dumps Chili Palmer, after he got her career going. I much preferred how they wrapped it up in the movie. Anyway, it's great fun, and the cast is terrific."
4,A very good sequel,"I really liked this movie. The actors perform beautifully and The Rock is the funniest of all. He plays his character seriously, with that high brow trick and is incredible.In fact, the only thing I didn't like is John Travolta smoking endless cigarettes. We don't know how much Philip Morris paid for the hidden advertisement, but Travolta is the only smoking person in the whole movie. Well, Tyler smokes a cigar, but we know cigar smokers gather mostly in their own private clubs and poison each other without going out. That's fine and good. Travolta doesn't need the extra money.Anyway, seeing John Travolta dance is always a kick. He's really smooth and cool and everything. Good job, except for the uncalled, useless smoking."
4,Great Movie,"Not better then GET SHORTY, but still a great movie. Great new cast added to the movie. Very Funny. John Travolta is da man."
1,Disappointing,"This is possibly one of the worst big budget movies every made. That's especially disappointing since the book clearly intended to be the plot for a follow-up to Get Shorty. Elmore Leonard received some sort of production credit, so against the better judgment I'd made after seeing the previews, I rented the DVD. The plot is irrational, unbelievable, and simpering. Maybe some music exec decided to water down the criticism of the corruption in the music business, but that's what the story was about. Without that background and with a completely plain and marginally talented remake of the main musical character, Linda Moon, the story simply doesn't make sense. This is the first Elmore Leonard movie I've ever disliked."
5,Great Amazon Seller!!!,The Be Cool dvd arrived in excellent condition. Will look forward in ordering more dvds from this seller in the future. Wonderful job!!!
1,Not Cool...,"Picked up this dvd previewed from a local retailer. Get shoty was funny and entertaining. ""Be Cool"" is far and a way the worst movie I have seen in a very long time.After the first 45 minutes I realized that I did not laugh one time. Needless to say, I still stuck it out till the end and I did not laugh. This is not a comedy and was not funny at all.If it was not for Cedric the Entertainers speech to the Russian Biggot (a serious point of the movie), this movie is entirly forgettable.Typical movie for the masses. If this is the deffinition, I am glad I am not or ever will be ""Cool"".By the way the music also is beyond terrible."
1,F. Sweet stole my review and posted it on Amazon,"I am urging all readers to boycott F. Sweet who is bragging about how many reviews he ""writes"" when all he is doing is stealing other people's work, adding a little to it, and posting!Victoria AlexanderFilmsInReview.com"
3,"Ok to rent, but I wouldn't buy it","Yet another Hollywood production that panders to the MTV crowd. There's a few decent scenes but overall it's a farce. Cedric the Non-Entertainer portrays a Suge Knight characature along with his hapless cheap gag lines and inept followers. Vince Vaughn plays the ""wigger"" role with shades of an Eminem-esqe portrayal. As if the real thing isn't bad enough. The Russian mobsters are made out to be blundering incompetant idiots and The Rock hams it up with an over the top flaming gay slapstick routine. It's a silly satire disguised as a serious attempt at comedy. I'm a big fan of Elmore Leonard, and I don't know how true the movie is to the book, but the script would have been better serves as a dark comedy with direction from Tarantino."
4,pretty good,be cool was a really funny movie. which has a wonderful cast. and is as good as get shorty.
2,So Many Good Actors Combined Into One Bad Movie,"I'm never looking at commercials again...This movie wasn't HORRIBLE, it just wasn't that great. Was sort of boring and dull. Not as good as I thought it would and disappointed. Only watched it once. Its worth the watch if you're curious, so rent it instead of buying it."
3,Lots of actors no substance,"I new this movie was made for TV but I figured that with so many well know actors that it would rival real movies. I was wrong. It was quite formula and many of the actors just walked through their parts.Chili Palmer (John Travolta ""Grease"" (1978)) ex-shylock goes from movie producer to record producer with the discovery of a suppressed singer Linda Moon (Christina Milian.) Naturally, she is under contract to a bad guy. Well so it does not look too simple or like some second rate musical, we through in a black want-to-be, a black gangster singing group, and even the Russian mafia.One of the main catalysts and the reason to watch this is Uma Thurman who played Irene Cassini in ""GATTACA"" (1997), and has done the impossible by just keeps looking cuter with age.Danny DeVito must think he is Alfred Hitchcock as he makes his cameo in the movie.All in all, it is watchable. Buy Blu-ray when you can but do not expect the acting to get any better.GATTACA [Blu-ray] ~ Uma Thurman"
3,It Worked For Me,"I am amazed at all these bad reviews. Whereas maybe it was not on the same level as Get Shorty, there wre some captivating scenes. John Travolta and The Rock alone make this film reasonable. The back and forth hustles by all these hitmen can get a bit annoying. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the laughs and a decent storyline. Nothing that is going to win acadmy awards but certainly a nice light movie."
2,Flat and boring.,"If you saw the previews for this movie you saw the best parts. Trouble is, with all the senseless filler in between the ""funny parts"" aren't funny anymore.Waste of such a talented cast, especially The Rock, his part should have been bigger. Not worth buying new, get a used copy if you must."
4,IT'S COOL!!!!!!!!!,"I laughed when I read one of the reviews on here where the person said he barely remembers the movie Get Shorty. I could say the same thing: I remember liking the movie, but I can't remember much about it all these years later. So I saw Be Cool with a clean slate. I laughed the whole way through, mostly because of the hilarious scenes featuring Vince Vaughn as the wannabe pimp. E-Weezee! E-Weezee! Stop hatin', start participatin'! Twinkle, twinkle, baby! Twinkle, twinkle!"
1,Jumbled dish .. no moghul buffet,"This is a strange book, shortly it has no purpose being a book. Moghul or Buffet or Peshawar really have nothing to do with the book it could be in timbktoo and still be boring. The plot is not only confusing but totally bizzare and left for the reader to imagine in the detail. Murder and sex is mixed in at odd places without purpose. This is not a novel, or a story, tt's a gibberish. Odd collection of minor facts arranged to no end. Try hard as you may you can't like anything about the book, neither plot, nor locale nor characters or the writing is of any consequence and one would do well without dwelling on them."
4,Great biography,Great look into the humble rise of Lincoln to President and the struggles he had once there. A must read for any American to truely understand the struggles of democracy.
4,excellent and concise. had some uncertian facts though.,"interesting in that it was written from a british perspective. i have read several biographies on lincoln and would recommend this book as an introductory volume for those who want to study lincoln, but, as an important volume for those who study general presidential history, civil war, and general american history."
3,Alfred Brendal Beethoven Piano Variations,"I won't claim that I have any expertise when it comes to critiquing a musical performance I like Alfred Brendal's playing in this box set. However, I find the intermittent background hiss in these recordings too distracting for me."
4,The Chinese Chop,"this novel stars Sheridan's favorites Janice Cameron and Lily Wu, but takes place in New York City instead of Hawaii. Its sort of a dark mystery that takes place during the 1949 post WWII housing shortage. Lily and Janice share a bedroom in a rooming house filled with a variety of other people who, unbeknownst to one another, all have a connection to the house and its former owners. That's all I can say without revealing too much of the mystery. I found the biographical introduction of the life of the author as interesting as the novel. :)"
3,Good but...,Table good srurdy usefulProblem was vendor has to replace 3 times. Each time parts were missing or broken.
5,headlight assembly worked perfectly,"A deer had hit our car and took out the whole headlight on the driver's side. Luckily that was the majority of the damage. Anyway, local parts stores wanted up to $175 for the headlight assembly. We looked on amazon.com and found the same product for much less. This product came to us quickly (before we went on vacation) and was a breeze to install. It fit perfectly! The only bad thing I can say about it was that it made the other headlight look really dingy and old! I definitely recommended it. Thanks."
3,A Good Alternative,"Good deal for the price! Was a little smaller then factory, so there is a small 1/4"" gap below light, and I had to buy longer screws to install it ($3 at auto parts store). I also had the seal go bad after a month. But it is a good working headlight (with bulbs) for a quarter of what the dealership wanted and half of what auto parts store wanted. Got me back safely on the road for much cheaper!"
5,FABULOUS!!!,"I ordered this for a friend who had lost her son & had her name & his placed on it. They did a wonderful job, she could not have been more pleased with it, and received it faster than I thought possible. What an affordable & meaningful gift. I sent them an email via Amazon telling them what the names signified & when I needed it there by, and she received it within days. It means more to her than any words I could write here. I am so thankful!"
3,The most successful album (reached Top 5),"Backstreet Dreams (VIII) 1993I don't like this album, although it is the most successful album of BLUE SYSTEM.This CD contains a few good (not bad) songs:03 Backstreet Heaven06 Dirty Money07 Ballerina Girl10 Michael Has Gone For A Soldier (my favourite)P.S. The best albums of BLUE SYSTEM are ""Hello America (VII)"" 1992, ""Seeds Of Heaven (V)"" 1991, ""Body To Body (XII)"" 1996 and ""Ten (X)"" 1994."
1,BACKSTREET DREAMS &#65533;&#65533; The very worst of Dieter Boheln.,"This is the 8th album of Blue System and THE worst album of Dieters whole carrier to me, but it is the highest charted position of the whole Blue Systems position, which was no.5 in the German charts. The singles were terrible but ~History is tolerable but I didnt like any other tracks in this album except that and ~Michael has gone for a Soldier. The 2nd single ~OPERATOR was the worst Blue System single not only in my opinion but also in the charts as it reached no.87!I dont have anything more to say about this album, if youre a collector like me please do buy it even though youll regret it like I am as I paid 10.99 pounds which is a lot for a horrible album like this.FACT: This is a Gold selling album"
1,Not impressed by it,"I disagree with Mr. Chiang on consumer marketing. If it was that easy, then everyone would be millionaires!! It's nice that he's been defending the privacy issues on behalf of us, but it has not worked. I understand that he's the credit expert, perhaps it is for his own gain and publicity rather than helping others. So get off your high horse Larry, because you ain't that impressive."
5,An excellent work for the practicing magus,"While this title will not offer a step by step lesson plan as do some of the classical Grimoires, it does offer a wealth of information, previously unavailable, which can be built into the experienced magus' work. Hence it is highly recommended for the more advanced practitioner and for the occult scholar, but not for the aspirant, student or neophyte."
4,The Bedford Reader,An excellent collection of stylistically important works. Very well-organized and informative as well as fun to read.
2,Orange Grove Road 1988,It was January 1988 and the Sidewinders had a party off of Orange Grove Road. We walked in there and everyone at the party was squeaky clean jock type. The boring type!The artwork on Witchdoctor is a misrepresentation of their clean cut soft rock sound. They were outcasts on the Tucson scene. The other bands had tattoos and heroin addictions and these guys were the mamas boys. These are the nice guys your parents told you about.
4,I ordered it for a friend,I haven't used this product but a friend of mine asked me to order. She has used it some time ago and told methat's the best ever. Highly recommended she says.
2,Not happy at all,"For 9 bucks a bottle, I was expecting a better product. It has a very mild and pleasant smell and rubs in easily leaving behind a slight greasy feeling. Sun protection was mediocre at best. I applied it once every 2 hours with no water exposure and I still got burned. They claim it is ""sweat proof"" and that it will not get in your eyes and sting... Totally inaccurate. I have never before experienced such a stinging sensation around the eyes from a sunscreen before.Terrible product and I will not be purchasing this again."
3,Don't be fooled!,"While the Merriam-Webster Visual Dictionary is nicely illustrated and impressively organized, it is not a dictionary. By its very definition, a dictionary is a book containing the words of a language arranged in alphabetical order, with their definitions and pronunciations. The words in this book are not arranged in alphabetical order, and the only way to find them is to go to a microscopic index at the back of the book. While the Merriam-Webster Visual Dictionary is indeed visual, it is by no means a a dictionary. It's getting pretty bad when a dictionary calls itself something that it is not."
2,WATP,"So far, I have done 14 miles with this Leslie Sansone tape. Leslie has a good team to walk with, they are encouraging and happy I mean, but there is not one person besides Randy(in his 60's?) that is overweight or really needs to get fit!When you're walking for weight loss, seeing other people with the same goal really helps.Also,I have the walk away belt to use with the video, but over the miles about the only place that got in good shape is my legs and thighs. My abs did get a little slimmer, but it wasn't what I exspected at all. But one bonus was ever since walking more, my appetite has took a drastic turn around and I'm not as hungry any more.So I'm still looking for a Leslie Sansone video or DVD that will tone and slim my middle!"
2,Least favorite,This is my 4th Sansone tape--I am not entirely pleased with it. The transitions in both music and pace are pretty shaky. The belt offers me little resistance--I use 2 pound hand weights instead. This is my least favorite tape. I use it after the 3 mile or 3 mile walk tape.
4,Upbeat Country Rock,"Lonestar's self-tittle album has a great upbeat sound, following in the country/rock style of the 90's. The album starts off with ""Heartbroke Every Day,"" a fast paced song that sets the pace of the album. There are a couple of good ballets, although ""Taquila Talkin,"" is definitely the best slow song on the album. The best song on the album is by far ""No News,"" a great and fun upbeat song.I definitely recommend this album to anybody who enjoys the country rock style of the 90's."
3,The safe Eckhart,"Meister Eckhart ran into trouble with the Church during his and it appears that some of his writings are still under official disfavor. This is a very safe selection of the master's writings, and really wasn't what I was looking for. I would avoid any selection made by a priest, as this one is, and look for something that offers a more representative view of his more difficult and unorthodox preaching."
5,Profoundly Inspirational,"Ah what a wonderful teaching. It is so surprising that something this enlighteningly profound came from a Catholic Monk in the dark ages. It just proves that great teachers can come from anywhere, any time, and any religious background. This is a highly spiritual book, that crosses the boundries of religious beliefs, and goes straight to the important spiritual teachings. This book will help you identify who you are, and why you are right here, right now. I had never heard of Meister Eckhart until I attended a teaching on his writings. What great revelation for me. If you are looking for spritually uplifting teachings, this is your book. If you are looking for something to condemn you congregation to hell with, you won't find it here."
2,"not for 9"" paper","I bought this from a retail store thinking that a 9"" trimmer would cut 9"" construction paper. Wrong...there is nothing on the box that indicates that it only cuts paper up to 8.5"" wide so I went ahead and picked this one over the ones that said 8.5"". I guess I will need to get a 12"" one for 9"" paper and I'm hoping to return this one to the craft store.For projects with paper 8.5"" or less it works pretty well, although the blade at the very top was a little rough and took some force to bring the cutting blade down. It looked like there were some burrs on the blade but is not a design flaw, just a minor problem with this blade only."
4,Trimmer for small items,"Nice little paper trimmer, but you can't fit a 8.5x11 sheet longways. It's just for small stuff. The feet really grip the surface, and the clear smudge guard holds the paper down for a nice straight cut. It's a Fiskars, so hopefully the blade will stay sharp a long time; their scissors sure do."
5,Great Small Cutter!,"I bought this mini cutter to have something for papers, didn't want a huge one due to space and also having kids in the house (didnt want anything too dangerous like the guillotine one i grew up with in the house.) This is small, but if you are using it for smaller projects around the house it's great. You can't really cut multiple pages, it's only good for one sheet of cardstock at a time or two sheets of copy paper. But it does the trick. Blade has kept sharp for a few years now, and it's holding up well!"
5,Good and portable!,"I bought this for my wife and her coupons, and it's been almost a year and she loves it. It's the right size to put away easily, but enough to cut her coupons."
5,a must have,"This is my 2nd one. I let my dau-in-law use my 1st. She liked it so much, I let her keep it, but I can't do w/o it so I bo't myself another."
3,"Worked great for the first two days, but then...","My boyfriend purchased this for me to help with cutting small tags printed on regular card stock. Since I have difficulties with shaky hands, I needed something steadier than a pair of scissors. This trimmer worked great for me for the first two days until the blade got stuck in the ""up position"" and wouldn't go down to cut. Upon inspection, a piece of the metal on the bottom flat edge was sheared just enough to hit the corner of the blade when it was pushed downward just from cutting (as I had been in the process of cutting labels when the blade stopped lowering). It was fixed by filing for a long time to get it to the point that it was no longer affecting the blade. Now, it's still working, but I'm fairly certain you should not have to do manual repairs in order to make a 2-day old item continue to function."
3,Good Book,The book is very easy to read. It does not keep repeating itself and has got a logical chapter order. It explains what the difference is between an improvement system and Kaizen Teian system. The book gives practical examples how to implement a kaizen Teian system. If your interested to implement ie TPM; Keizen Teian is a good foundation to start and then this book is a must.
4,A great book about a great New York band,"This is one awesome read. In addition to Martin Rev and Alan Vega telling their story, you get taken on a trip back to seventies New York. To name a few, Jayne County, Chris Stein, Sylvain Sylvain and Peter Crowley from Max's all comment on Suicide and New York itself. I have noticed one reviewer on this site being over critical about punctuation. I did not notice any great problems within No Compromise and do feel that this book gives the band the credit they truly deserve. Maybe the other reviewer is jealous that he did not have the balls to attempt such a project. You should read the review he gave the equally as good Iggy Pop book. This is a great book for anyone interested in the band and New York itself. A good companion to Please Kill Me..."
3,"Great Subject Matter, Poorly Executed","Suicide are one of the most original, most misunderstood, and most influential bands of the last 25 years. Their story is fascinating, but this book really needs to be put under a microscope and copyedited well and correctly if it goes into a second printing. Some of the pleasure that might be taken away from the story of this heroic band is definitely lost due to the poor quality of the writing. A good many of the problems would be solved if at least the punctuation were corrected. Unfortunately slack treatment for a duo who certainly do not believe in compromise and who deserve more care than went into this product."
2,Betty the Bolshie?,"Founding mother of the Women's Liberation Movement, Betty Friedan, author of the Feminine Mystique, was a long-time CPUSA apparatchik and never the typical suburban bourgeois housewife she posed as."
5,My cats' favorite canned food,"This is definitely my cats' favorite canned food. I have tried many others, like the ones that have almost exclusively meat, and they have not accepted so well. I have been using this food for years now (together with Royal Canin dry food) and my cats look very healthy, with super shinny coats and they are both in shape."
4,IT'S AN EARLY KRENTZ,I CAN'T FIND ANYWHERE THAT SHE WROTE THIS BOOK UNDER ANY OTHER NAME AND COPYRIGHT SHOWS 1989 AS THE YEAR. FOLLOWING THIS MAKES IT 3RD BOOK WRITTEN UNDER JAYNE ANN KRENTZ AND WAS NOT A SERIES BOOK. I AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN REVIEW HERO WAS A PAIN AND SOMETIMES A PIG BUT WE OFTEN FORGET ABOUT THE ERA THE BOOK IS WRITTEN IN. 1989 WAS 20 YEARS AGO AND THINGS WERE DIFFERENT. MALE ARROGANCE AND PRESENCE WERE DOMINATE AT THAT TIME EVEN THOUGH US WOMEN WERE ENJOYING MORE FREEDOMS LIFE STILL MOVED ON BUT VERY SLOWLY EVEN TODAY SHOWS SIGNS OF PAST TIMES. SO TO ME I FELT THAT IT WAS A TYPICAL JAYNE ANN KRENTZ BOOK AND I HAVE ALL AND HAVE READ EVERY ONE OF THEM AND CONTINUE TO DO SO. IN WHATEVER NAME..................
5,I loved this book!,I am in the process of buying and reading everything Jayne Ann Krentz/Amanda Quick/Jayne Castle has written. I have not been disappointed yet! Hoping all of her out of print books will be reissued. I was late in finding Ms. Krentz but I'll not rest till I've read them all!
3,Not my favorite,"AFter reading all the 5* reviews, had to put my comments in. I've read most of JAK (& Amanda Quick & Jayne Castle), and re-read them. Including this one. The plot is good, I like all the stuff about books and old books, but the hero is just too obnoxious. I know they're all a little too macho, but this guy is rude and lacks some of the endearing qualities of her other heros. He does get better as the book goes on, but not soon enough for me. I would have dumped him way back. I actually prefer her newer work, where the heroes are a little less rude and the heroines more willing to stand up for themselves."
4,A good read!,"I am a huge fan of JAK and have been reading my way through all of her books. Midnight Jewels is the story of a used book seller, Mercy Pennington, who stumbles upon a rare book in a flea market. The plot unfolds as she attempts to sell the book and discovers the dangerous situation surrounding it. The hero, Croft Falconer, competes with the villian to purchase the book and the story developes from there. This is not my most favorite JAK book but it is a good read, fast paced with nice character development."
2,Wish I had read the reviews!,"Was so confused reading this book. Interesting plot, but just could not like these characters. They give passive aggressive a bad name. And who goes playing spy without a cell phone? Then I came back here and read the reviews to find out this was a reprint from the 80s. All makes sense now, but wish I had bought the book rather than the Kindle version so I could return it!This is unconscionable to give these stories new copyright dates without reference to the first published date. I thought I was buying a new book. At least Nora Roberts' publisher has come up with a way to differentiate her reprints from new work. Too bad all publishers don't have that integrity.At least I've learned to read ALL the reviews before I buy. You reviewers rock."
1,not what i expected,"I have been a fan of Jayne ann krentz under all her psuodonyms, but I couldn't finish this book. I think this book should have been classed as erotica. I don't mind some sex in books, but when a book is 80% sex and 20% plot, I lose interest. I hope she will not continue in this vein. I also wish amazon had a class of erotica to let those of know ahead of time before we spend hard earned money on books that we don't even want to finish."
3,True Fan,I've loved JAK for years and its great that many of her books are now available digital HOWEVER I realize that what is a satisfying read at 1-2 dollars at the used book store doesn't hold up at $5. Maybe because its a throwback or maybe I've outgrown JAK after 15 plus years I found her last new read equally okay.
2,The hero is insufferable.,I love her more recent books and thought to try her older works. I'm glad this wasn't her first book i read or I would have missed out on some amazing books. This book was a huge disappointment. I could barely read it as the hero was annoying and a jerk. He was insufferable. The whole book was lacking in enjoyment and was overall annoying. I say skip this book and move on to some of her more recents. Wish I could get my $5 back and my afternoon.Major disappointment.
1,not like her usual,"sometimes an author's early works are nostalgic and enjoyable (like her jayne castle stuff and family man)Maybe I got the wrong book, but this one just doesn't make sense. Concept wise, it could be interesting. (somewhat OCD guy regarding tea, but does martial arts with possibly commonsense woman..who lost all common sense due to the story itself) Execution was probably REALLY hard, or...I don't know.In any case, this book should NOT be the first one a person should read by the author. There are a lot of others that should provide a more enjoyable experience. (The ones as amanda quick, or even the other standalones, like wildest hearts, family man, sofr focus...or her current trend with the light paranormal.The author's formula is good and her characters likable...don't judge her by this one book."
2,Mediocre Romance,I was very disappointed in this novel as I am a romance fan and have read Krentz before and enjoyed her. The characters were one dimensional and the plot line was a little silly. As a big Nora Roberts fan - I can suspend the logical (as in incorporating witchcraft and the supernatural) but the plot lines in Roberts flow better. Overall - I would not recommend you bother with this - although the sex scenes were worth the read.
2,not her best,"I have not finished reading the book, I am having a hard time getting there. I have always liked reading this womans works, until this book. The male character is a know it all jerk. I admit I do not care for sex scenes in books, with that said if I ever did like them I would NOT like these. He was forcing himself on her even while she was saying no, and then when it was over she was smiling and content while he was smug and arrogant. I find it hard to believe this is the same author who has written so many books that have be so enjoyable to read. For myself, I sincerely hope she goes back to her former style of writing. I cannot recommend this book to anyone."
2,Missed the Mark,"Maybe it was me. However, the book just did not seem logically constructed. It felt hurried. The plot was so unlikely that I had difficulty finishing the book and ended up paging through it. I just cannot see a hero exposing the heroine to the degree of explicit and obvious danger portrayed here. I have read most of Jayne Ann Krentz's work. This did not seem like one of her better efforts."
5,Midnight,I gave this 5 stars because it kept my attention all the way. A real page turner that I didn't want to put down until finished.JAK really knows how to captivate her readers.This book is great for someone interested in paranormal.
2,Disappointed,"I love Jayne Ann Krentz's books, but this one left a lot to be desired. I seemed as if I was reading a book on the junior high level with little realism of characters and far too much baloney."
4,Midnight Jewells by Jayne Ann Krentz,"I have been enjoying these books written as Jayne Castle, Jayne Ann Krentz and Julia Quinn. Just wish more books released on Kindle e books."
3,I collect her books...,"so I needed this one. It reads about the same...pretty girl, odd situation and tall, dark and you know...But the thing is she always mixes things up. Her detail is interesting (in this case old books ) and how things fit together is alwaysmore complex and engrossing than you would think given that there is a formula at work here.I've collected most of her books. I won't say this is her beat but it is a good read and might get a new reader hooked."
4,Midnight Jewels,This is a very well written story about two very different people coming together in a journey to a potentially dangerous business transaction. Felt like you were hearing a story about real people and you wanted to get to know them better. Very interesting getting their differences worked out while solving the mystery on whether the man in her business life is just a rich eccentric or a murdering drug lord.
5,Great gift,"I had purchased this shoe as a gift for a friend. She said her daughter loves to walk on them. I bought my son 3 pairs (in different sizes) and he loves them, of course!"
4,LeBra for 2005 Mustang,"Overall, I love it! It looks great and protects my car. It was not as easy to install as I had thought, only because it is very tight fitting, however after driving for a week or so, I find that other areas are quite loose. No flapping whatsoever! Great look!"
1,purchase,"I had to return this movie because it was a ""Region"" that I didn't realize I could not play. I would very much like to had a DVD that I would be able to play. I wanted to add it to my Danielle Steel collection."
2,To sad for my taste.,I didn't see quite the whole movie but what I did see was really sad. I didn't cry though. I would have given it 1 star but part of it was pretty exciting or interesting.
4,Outstanding Trip Through a Fascinating Land,I'll just defer to the other reviewers on this page since their views of this wonderful book agree with mine. Fermor is a treasure. I've read all of his books and enjoyed them.
2,Couldn't finish this,Had awfully high expectations after the review I'd read. But it's just too tedious a slog. Much beyond patience required.
5,Romantic and Touching,"This is a wonderful WW11 story about a woman(Hawn) whos husband(Harris)signs up to be sent overseas. While her husband is away, Hawn befriends her neighbor(Lahti) and they both get swing shift jobs building planes for the war. While working, Hawn meets Russell(who is 4F) and they begin an elicit affair that blooms until Harris returns unexpectedly. Lahti gives an emotional stand out performance and Hawn and Russells offscrean romance brings believable life to their onscreen affair.This is a wonderful movie about seperation, deception, friendship and forgivness. A must see for everyone!"
4,Swing Shift,Swing shift was one of my favorite movies about WWII because it wasmostly about what was happening on the home front during that time. MostWWII movies were about the military battles or what was happeningin Europe or in the far east.
5,A good believable story,"I am drawn to movies about life in the USA during WWII. The story is believable, funny at times, and shows how people reacted to their changing world. I also see the pride in being an American and defending our nation in this movie. The actors played their parts well. Goldie Hawn was entirely believable as a slightly naive, home-spun girl. Christine Lahti was outstanding as 'Hazel', the aspiring singer.This is one of my 'chick-flicks'...I have 10-15 that I watch regularly."
3,Missed opportunity,"Swing Shift is one of those movies that couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedy or a drama and didn't quite succeed as either one. I like the premise, about women going to work on the home front during WWII. It's a great opportunity to explore gender roles and sexism in the workplace. ""Swing Shift"" does explore those themes but only briefly. Most of the time it's a tired tale of romance and jealousy that we've seen many times before. And despite the big budget feel of the movie (impressive factory scenes, etc.) the story didn't seem quite convincing. Didn't Goldie's characted have any correspondence with her husband for three years?The actors do a fine job. One of my favorite actresses, Holly Hunter, has a small role and shines in her few scenes. And the production values are good as mentioned, so I blame the screenwriters for not making this interesting premise into a more entertaining story. This just wasn't very entertaining. 3-"
3,Eye appealing but cheaply made,I recently bought this dog house for my Beagle/Hound. Its very appealing to the eye however after the first rain one of the boards on the roof started to split. (We've had it 1 month). I'm hoping it holds up because we paid a little over $200. and thats a lot of money to throw away.I will say that it was easy to put together and its very light.
4,Nice and easy.,The house came neatly packaged and all pieces were there. The house was extreamly easy to put together. Me being a guy I could even put it together CORRECTLY without the instructions. Which is quit a feat if you ask my wife!Overall I am happy with the product. I am using it for two pygmy goats and thy seem to like it just fine. Now we will see how well it holds up in the long run.
5,Annother Great Gaither Homecoming DVD,I bought this DVD for my mother for her birthday. I have always enjoyed any of the Gaither Homecoming editions. This one was as special as the rest. I especially liked watching The Hoppers perform Jerusalem. She loved the dvd and so did I. Would purchase another.
4,"Quick read, some common sense tips but some helpful","Dr. Lois Frankel's 101 mistakes women make in the work place was an overall good book. While some of the 'mistakes' seem common sense, some were news to me. I have made a couple changes (adding my last name to my voice mail messages and drafting more concise email messages) after reading this book. It is a quick, easy read."
4,Great book!,"I've read this myself before and got this book for one of my best friends. She absolutely loves it! An awesome guideline for young females who are entering into the business world, fits more with corporate environment though."
4,Good book,Pretty true and I am glad I read it. not the most obvious thing in the world but it seems to have some good fact behind it.
5,A male who agrees!,"My wife brought this book home and I took a peek. Yes, this author hits the nail on the head. Women in the workplace too often look for approval from others and when they don't do something right, apologize too quickly. Guys are naturally competitive and don't expect apologies. We're into using strengths and opportunities to the max as we move forward. If you are looking to others for approval, this book is for you. For the mental software to be your best and how to make the most of any personal or work situation, read Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self. When you use Optimal Thinking, you optimize yourself, others and your results regardless of your gender or your circumstances."
4,Excellently Organized!,"This book is organized in a way that allows the reader to quickly get to the heart of the matter. First, the author takes the reader through an introduction of why she wrote the book and what she hopes the reader will take away. Next, is a questionaire whose results will lead the reader through the rest of the book. At this point, the book becomes tailored to the needs of the reader. This allows the reader to quickly improve their work relationships and develop a better understanding of the corporate environment."
4,Nice Girls need Corner Offices,"I liked the verbal hints when it came to saying statements like questions. I have tried to take up more space in elevators (this is fun! because everyone else moves around you!) But the take up more space hasn't changed much.I think you should read this book if you can get it used or borrow it the regular price is to much. When you read it take the advice that make sense and use it where you can.But this book is for women in Business, if you want a touchy, feely book to make you feel more empowered because you are a woman, this isn't it. But it will make you see the mistakes that women make in the work place and simple things you can change."
5,Excellent Book for Women,"I wish someone would have given me this book when I graduated college!!! This is a must have for women entering or in the corporate world. I found the advice realistic and practical. While not every mistake will apply to you, I personally found that many did and have used many of her suggestions. I thought this was a great read!"
4,Some things I really hadn't thought of,"I did not take the assessment at the beginning of the book, but rather dove straight into the tips. There were some I struggled with - for example, smiling too much. But hey, I'm a happy person! I work for a large marketing company ($2.5 billion in revenue), but we have a unique culture, so not all of the tips fit. But, most of the tips were useful and quite applicable. The book is a quick read. I also like that she added useful links, other resources and the like throughout the book."
4,"Good content, poor choice of title","I was pleasantly surprised to find an extraordinarily comprehensive compendium of ""in your face"" helpful information. My only beef with the book is the title. What message does it send to the men? Precisely the one Ms. Frankel is trying to change: Why should a male CEO hire a woman if he's reading on the bestseller list that women naturally do all these things wrong in the office? Maybe it's semantics, but I would've preferred a more positive approach. At the beginning of the book, Ms. Frankel states that the mistakes she points out are what keep women viewed as ""girls,"" and not ""women."" I like that point (and almost all of her tips). I just don't dig the negativity on the cover (which, unfortunately is all the men will see)."
5,Every Page is Worthwhile,"Ladies- this is a good one. I love how the author includes in here a suggestion for appropriate work attire too as I'm sick of women coming to work looking like their going to a night club, a ball, or a picnic and standing in bathroom spritzing, primping, and admiring themselves in the mirror. I recommend all women who work in an office environment and don't have the advantage of nepotism or being a favored coddled employee read this book! Every turn of one page to the next is worth it."
1,I'd rather be nice.,"I would much rather be considered nice and earn my way through this world the way I am. Being myself in the business arena has worked well for me thus far, and I don't care if the trend is to deviate from feminity. I think we should respect everyone, and not propegate the evolution of a sexless society. All in all, I would much rather be a nice person and have people like me than be a b%tch with a nice office. People remember you by how you made them feel, not by how much money or power you had."
1,Throw your ethics out the window for success?,"While this book did have a few mistakes that were valid, I find the author's writings to be very ageist and sexist.Mistake number 79 is the biggest bunch of garbage and the worst in the lot. I can't believe people on here have given this so many stars! This book is pure trash."
1,Nice girls...bad CD,"Nice girls dont get the corner office is a big corner of negativity. If you want to feel aweful just give this CD a listen. Lois Frankel put me to sleep. She sounds like the the unseen teacher in the charlie brown series. ""Mistake number 6854984742 dont pick your nose the board room...wah wah wah."" Terrible. Dont waste your money. Try Tom Hopkins advanced sales survival training CD#2 hilarious, uplifting and helpful to all."
1,I've met a Lot of Tough Women who are still at the bottom,"Nice girls do go somewhere ""not"" nice girls don't go - further. There are lots of women who are ""not"" nice and revels in being ""not"" nice at the bottom still fetching coffee and running someone else's personal errands. Somehow they stay at the bottom, while their nicer, savvier counterpart moves up the ladder, using her brain and social skills to move up."
2,Wouldn't Hire This Author to Coach Managers,"While this book provides some solid help for women managers who tend to want to be ""nice"" all the time, Frankel is also disturbing in places. Her ethics are a little too much ""go along to get along""--if I were president of a company, I wouldn't think it was okay to discover that an executive's secretary had been lying to me about the executive's whereabouts--In fact, I'd fire the secretary. (Even just saying ""he/she isn't available"" would be better than blatent lying.) As for keeping one's mouth closed about sexual discrimination, there are more ""subtle"" options in the business world to address the problem than the book covers. Frankel does make some good points: the need to balance being respected with being liked; the need to consider other people's motives in deciding how to respond to a situation; and perhaps most importantly, that if you want something, you need to ask for it."
2,"Some Good, Some Bad","I read ""Nice Girls Don't Get the Corner Office"" when I started out in the business world. While some things in the book are true (for example, ""Waiting to Be Given What you Want"" and ""Asking Permission"" are very valuable chapters), othera are just not applicable in several industries to be considered an overall truth (""Feeding Others""), and some are flat out wrong (""Working Hard"").I found this book to have equal parts good and bad. I'd recommend it only to someone who can take the advice with a grain of salt, and knows their environment/industry well enough to know if a lesson would help them or not."
4,A worthwhile read,"This book addresses the adult woman in the workplace. This is a read by an author who clearly has made her own way in the world of work and has helped many other women to do the same.Practical, insightful, down to earth and real. This book is for grown up women who want to stop self-defeating behaviors and embrace the freedom of being the completely competent, powerful, fun person they are.I'll never cry in the workplace again. I'll never again feel I'm asking for too much by simply being clear about what's needed to complete a project .This is a book for the bedside table and for the top of your desk.Was this review helpful to you?"
4,Get this book and treat it as a workplace bible,"Lois Frankel expertly describes and then steers us away from those pesky behaviors we engage in at work that have us look way smaller (and I don't mean in size) than we actually are. For example, offering do someone else's photocopying. Or saying, ""I'm sorry,"" when, in fact, there's nothing to be sorry about. We're so used to saying it that it slips out without notice -- by us, anyway, but not by everyone else. Oh, and laughing at the end of most sentences...what's up with that? So many women actually do that, and it takes away from whatever they've just said. Frankel's book is necessary reading, and it's an easy read -- it's divided into short sections, with one page for the mistake and one page for coaching tips."
4,Great information for certain people.,"This book is written specifically for women who feel that there are hidden roadblocks to their sucess in the business world. There are other women who deny/don't care about these same issues. Thus, it is not for everyone. First chapter ""self-diagnosis"" tells it all. If you want to change, it will help."
2,questionnaire ruined gift,"Although I did buy this book used, I did not know there was a questionnaire (which had been filled out).When I gave it to my daughter, she said ""thanks, but why did you write in the questionnaire?"" Thank G-d it was my daughter or I would have been extremely embarrassed."
5,Recommended for any young woman new to the work force,"There are certainly alot of things college doesn't teach you about the real world. Like many young women today society shows you how easy it is to get certain things done when you act sweet and naive. What you don't think about is the fact that people find it hard to picture someone who is young and sweet as anything other then an entry-level employee. This book helps show the strategies you can use that allow you to still be a woman, but get things done and project a persona that is confident adn a leader. I highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you find that you still use your girlish-charm to get things done."
5,Excellent Tips,"I found this book to be full of excellent tips and tricks to use in the business world. Many of the things I already knew but the author highlighted on some things that I had never even thought of. As an example, ""Unless you're Betty Crocker, don't bring the baked goods."" As for the why, I'll let you read the book and find out.I personally thought that the book was overpriced because the font is huge and there is only one topic covered on each page so if you can find it used I would recommend buying it that way."
2,Be Warned!,"Honestly, I think this cost too much money for what you get. It isn't a kit, they need to take that out of the title. I got it in the mail and was surprised that it was just a spiral bound book. It looks like they created it on their computer, put spiral binding on it and put an inflated price on it. The cover isn't even laminated. Buyer beware. The contents are ok. I was hoping for activities to use in my classroom. I didn't find it. Total waste of money."
1,"Look elsewhere, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!",Methods are outdated and rely more or less on the momentum stock craze of the late 90's.(example: csco was 70 a share when they wrote the book and is used in most or their examples.) I highly doubt they are still trading. Daytrading is a tough business so look to get reliable infomation. Dont start with this book. Sorry to be so critical but its just bad information to sell to the public.
3,Straight Album,"To the other foo who gave this album a bad review, buck em. This album is coo, the 2nd song is tight, the song at the end with all the other AWOL artists, the song 'B**ch Made N***s,' Straight up it's cool. In the middle it gets kinda weak, but the beginning and end songs are gangsta. the last 3 songs are tight, the 2nd, 4th, 5th and 7th are tight too. Her best album in my opinion is of course 'Wicked.' But this album comes close. 'Ghetto Blues' is tight too (old school gangsta ishh)"
3,Mixed Bag,This version of The Sound of Music is a mixed bag. It includes the original soundtrack recording (with all its edited versions-no good) along with some additional soundtrack cuts. It's better than the original soundtrack recording from 1965 but much less than the 2 CD version that was released earlier with lots more tracks. I should have bought the 2 CD version.
5,CD Music,The package come very quickly and all albums were in it.They came exactly as decribed and appeared .The price was reasonable for all the albums
3,Great find!,"Me and my kids love this one. Case was in worn shape, but mailed within days of purchase and the CD is quality."
5,one of the best movies till date!,old is gold...thts one true saying......one of thebest kind of music...which adults as well as children enjoy!
5,A Classic with Incredible Music,Why anyone would need to review something so well known and so amazing in it's scope is beyond me. You would have be living in a cave not to know about this movie and soundtrack. Rarely do we see a range of music as profound as this!
3,"JULIE ANDREWS TURNS LUSH ""MUSIC"" INTO A CLASSIC!","Irwin Kostal's Academy Award winning orchestrations here are vivid and lush, but lack the intimate quality of the 1959 Broadway score. The film also omits two songs, ""How Can Love Survive?"" and ""No Way To Stop It,"" which gave the Broadway Show a much more biting, political edge. And this RCA 30th Anniversary Soundtrack is still much too brief with 16 tracks. The Gold CD, which came with a laser-disc edition of the movie, has 29 tracks and runs about 75 minutes. Still, there's absolutely no denying the endearing (and enduring) appeal of Julie Andrews as Maria Von Trapp. Her performances of the title song and ""I Have Confidence"" are superb. It is the effortless efforvesence of Julie Andrews that makes this Soundtrack a Cherished Classic for All Time!"
5,LOVE IT,I love the portability of having it on my laptop. We move it around with us as we are cleaning and singing along wth the upbeat classic songs that we love!
5,ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!,I highly recommend this movie. My daughter requested it for Christmas and she is very pleased with it.Great product--great service!
5,Great gift for my mother,This item was exactly what I was expecting. I was very pleased with this purchase. It made an excellent gift.
1,Sound of Music,"Unless I got a disk with a manufacturing error, this is a very poor reproduction of beautiful music. I was disappointed."
2,Where is Edelweiss?,"I can't believe they did all this about the anniversary edition and left off the original singing of Edelweiss. They have the reprise (from the scene with the big show before escaping), but they totally left out the one most people are familiar with -- where he sang with the children when he first discovered they were singing.The original soundtrack (RCA version) had it, but left out the second verse (where the daughter joins in during the movie). I was hoping that this new soundtrack album would restore the second verse, but it looks like they decided to drop it altogether!!Nice sound, though, on the others. And nice to have ""Laendler"" in there. But skipping ""Edelweiss"" was crazy, or a big mistake (since the later track calls it a reprise -- a reprise of a missing song!)..."
4,Brings back memories,If you love the music in the movie get this soundtrack. All the songs are on this collection in clear quality. The music is hopeful even though the movie is set in a difficult time in history. Brighten your day with this soundtrack.
5,EXCELLENT MUSIC,"This is one of my all time clasics favorites.I guess that when you grow up, this was one of my best experieces.And is awsome to be able to listen to the music again."
5,The Sound of Music Audio CD,I have the original Album of The Sound of Music. I wanted this CD so that I would be able to listen to it in my car. The Sound of Music is one of my all time favorite movies. I never get tired of hearing the beautiful music that came from this movie!
5,Sound of Music Sound track.,"Any one who loved the film, will relive it via the Sound Track. I highly recommend the Music Sound Track."
3,The sound quality is AWFUL!,"I'm glad another reviewer mentioned the same problem, so I know it's not just my particular CD. This is sold as an ""original"" recording, so I knew it might not sound like something recorded yesterday, but I was not prepared at all for the terrible quality of some of the songs. They literally sound like someone played the movie on a TV and stood in front of it with an old tape recorder, and then made a CD from that. It's fuzzy, grainy, and the voices echo. This is one of the greatest musicals of all time, and this CD didn't do it justice one bit. So disappointed. Watch the movie instead."
2,Skip this sub-par version for the SUPREME one!,"I always enjoyed this version, first on vinyl, then on CD. But when I bought the Fox 30th Anniversary Boxed LaserDisc it included the COMPLETE soundtrack on a gold CD. Not only did it include extended versions of songs (Sixteen going on Seventeen, The Lonely Goatherd), but also includes the waltzes played at the party scene, and the original versions of Edelweiss (with Captain Von Trapp and Leisl) and Sixteen going on Seventeen (with Maria and Liesl). The CD runs 74minutes and has 29 tracks. It is a must-have for any Sound of Music fan! The RCA version just doesn't measure up, once you have heard this version."
2,45 th anniversary edition ???,"This 45th edition doesn't include any new contents, it repeats some old song versions from the 40th anniversary edition and doesn't include the following songs, which were present on previous releases: ""Salzburg Montage"", ""The Grand Waltz"" ""Proccesional Waltz"", ""The Chase"", ""The Escape"".¬øWhen will we be able to enjoy a complete edition of this soundtrack?"
3,Sound of Music - 40th Anniv. Special Edition,"The extra tracks (at the end) of interviews with cast members are annoying, and you most certainly would not want to listen to them more than once."
3,It could be better,I love this cd alot.The nun songs are some of the best even though i wish they had all the music from the broadway cd.The children are wonderful.Julie Andrews did better than Mary Martin even though she hits some notes that make your hair stand up.The ending of do-re-mi is better than in the broadway version.I wish it had all the songs from the movie instead of just 16.
5,A long-time favorite,I absolutely love this movie and the soundtrack it almost like being able to watch the movie in my car without driving off the road and crashing to my death.
5,Sound of Music for Kindle is great!,I love listening to music on my kindle. Thanks for having this available. The sound is great and I will enjoy it on my trip.
4,Great musical,Always loved the music. This is a more complete soundtrack than the one I had previously. Contains more of the instrumental pieces than just the songs we've sung to our whole lives.
5,The Sound of Music,The Sound of Music was nothing but a classic. It was some wonderful music. I am so glad I bought it.
1,"A classic, yes","The Sound of Music is a classic to be sure, but it isn't worth the paper it's written on, considering the wide range of musicals out there. Shows like this gave musicals a bad name; after all, this is just as vapid, bloodless, and self-congratulating as most other Rogers and Hammerstein musicals (and notice I only say most: things like Oklahoma deserve to be classics). Save your money for Sondheim, or earlier: Gershwin."
2,Hard to work with.,This wood bubbled and rolled up after being glued. Total waste of money. just make sure it will work for you before buying.
3,wood veneer,"Looks great, easy to trim with scissors. I stained veneer but didn't put laquer on the veneer and when it dried it warped."
5,Very appealing to baby,"My 15 months old baby adores to lift the flaps... This is probably for bit older age, as there are too many on the page"
2,nah!,"If I'd had the opportunity to look at it first, I wouldn't have bought it. I use Lift-the-flap books with my preschool students for 'speech' therapy. I was disappointed that some of the flaps (first, fifth page) seem useless, and on the page with upper case alphabet, the flaps lift up in rows - not for each individual letter. That leaves a high risk for bending/tearing of flap and the child cannot match up the letter with the object underneath the flap."
4,Pretty good stuff,I purchased this product after reading about the effects of cayenne and garlic for appetite control. Works pretty good with a fat burner I use. Using it alone simply did not curb my cravings the way I wanted. All appetites are different. I still recommend as it may help you reach your weight loss goals. Garlic is just overall great for anyone to take because of it's healing powers.
5,Perfect while baby is napping!,"This tape is a great starting point for a new mom! as soon as the baby goes down i throw this in and am done in 15 mins! enuff time left over to nap , take a shower or clean house! Not sure how much of an AB work out i am getting but still....I LUV IT!"
4,Enigma...Deep Forest...Nitin Sawhney,"Although known as remixer and collaborator Mr Sawhney is also a gifted musician. His choice of samples and rhythyms ring around the globe blending deliciously on song after song. I first discovered him on the Cafe del Mar series Vol 6, not notable but original. I recommend this to those who like the above artists."
1,Awful mish-mash of eco-trip-crap,"This disk is truly as bad as Nitin's previous disks were wonderful. Take any previous Nitin disk, throw in some Alpha, a bit of Craig Armstrong, some predictable eco-freindly american diatribe, mix until extremely smooth and you have a prophesy. As with most prophesies there no good news about it. My prophesy is that anyone who buys this won't ever buy another Nitin disk"
2,customer review,the temperature gage on this product cant be used unless you put it in maximum 1500. if you want to put it in 900 mode you cant regulate the temperature. also when you turn it off and turn if back on instead of being in low it is in high. so if the electricity goes out in the middle of the night i would have to reset it to low. i think it should be able to maneuver more easily and it doesnt. i was very disappointed.
1,"Great heater, but no FAN-ONLY mode","Though the technical details (both here & on the manufacturer's site) refer to the existance of a fan-only mode (along with high & low heat), the unit actually does not have such a thing. Correspondance with Air King directly has confirmed this fact, by responding ""I check [sic] with our engineers and this model does not have a fan only option.""Seems like a great heater though."
2,No fan only function!,"Second try on getting the info through. Amazon, this is important stuff since it's taken quite a bit of effort to determine the issue, and then try to get the credit from the vendor.As a heater, the unit seems to work great. But pay attention...there is no ""fan only"" setting as advertised!!!"
1,Should stick to writing movies.,"This is a perfect example of someone in Hollywood who thinks they can write a book but so obviously cannot. The descriptive passages are endless (and badly written) (and worse: BORING). Every cliche seems to be used, every ugly stereotype (the character names alone are like out of a bad 70's sitcom). The pacing is rather like being at a wake for the dead relative you only met once when you were five. WHEN WILL IT END? I kept reading thinking maybe the ending would make it all worth while. NOT! But it wasn't even an ending that made me want to throw the book against the wall, at that point I just didn't care any longer. I bought this book because someone (the author's friend I think) compared it to ""Catcher In The Rye"" (I thought COOL! A mystery with Catcher elements) - and to that I say: YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! Salinger should sue."
3,"Alternate audio take on ""Every little Thing...""","There is a DEFINITELY different and inferior take used for ""Every little Thing..."" If you're a purist, watch the version on the documentary. THAT is the correct version! Not just a re-mix. It is a DIFFERENT take! Diff. vocals, diff. gtr. licks and WAY different drums! ACK!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I loaded this DVD and immediately cued up ""Don't Stand So Close To Me"", my favorite Police song. The sound seemed a bit off, and the video was surprisingly bad. Reviews here warned me that the video hadn't been cleaned up, and it hadn't, but it was something else. I put in my copy of ""Every Breath You Take""; a collection of videos on VHS released in 1986, which also includes ""Don't Stand So Close To Me"". I picked a random frame, and did a freeze frame at the same spot on both my VCR and DVD so I could switch back and forth between the two. I was amazed at how much better the VHS looked than the DVD. And this tape is *19 years old* and has been played many, many times.As for the songs being sped up, I did one quick check. My DVD player reports ""Don't Stand So Close To Me"" as being 3:53. My vinyl copy of ""Zenyatta Mondatta"" lists the time as 4:03."
2,Crappy,"I like the songs of The Police very much, including their music videos, but whoever produced and mixed this DVD must have been smoking crack. I agree with Megan Foster from Hermance, Switzerland. A lot of the music videos included in this DVD had tracks missing (i.e. vocal tracks, guitar tracks, etc.). I thought I was the only one not hearing these things. I tried exchanging this DVD from the store I bought it from to see if it was just a bad DVD, but all the other copies I got were the same. About the only redeeming thing this DVD had was the documentary film from Montserrat. The videos on that documentary sounded better."
3,rehash of once cute mtv videos,the band was the best. this is studio video rehash so not live performance or as edgy. but they were cute as were their songs
5,Amazing,"If you like the band or just one member of it you must get this.Their classics with all their music videos which are now hard to find. Well worth the money, great sound quality as well.I have this DVD playing in my car and at home."
3,A comment,"Great as a record of DeSylva,Henderson & Brown's contribution to popular music. Check out how many of the tunes you did'nt know you were familiar with.The great pity then that the renditions of these classics are culled from ancient archives (sounding sometimes in something Before mono!.)Good News! (1995 Studio Cast)"
1,Lacking for acoustic guitars.,I am very disappointed in this book. There is almost no information on setting up and adjusting a steel string acoustic guitar. I don't know much but I already know a lot more about it than what is in this book.
2,"Not for guitar ""Players""","This book is for Luthiers, not an ordinary Joe. I found the directions to be scattered and not in an order where things are made simple. Only certain brands are highlighted. This may be a great book for guitar techs. In fact, it should be called ""The guitar technician's guide...."" NOT ""The guitar PLAYERS guide....."" But then they wouldn't sell so many copies then would they? I'm thoroughly disappointed. This book will either go to a used book store, or in the trash next to the $600.00 guitar with a stripped truss rod that I thought I had the know-how to adjust."
3,Not Quite what the title says....,"If you want a bit of theory into guitar repair, this is ok. The over-simplified drawings do not go into detail enough so you are left with more questions than the confidence to really tackle the job yourself. Dan also appears to be pushing products for Stewart Macdonald whom he works for. If you are new to repair, work on a used or beaten down instrument first. This book needs more revision and it needs to go to a more photo step by step guide format."
2,"Strong on knowledge, weak on presentation.","This book is obviously written by someone with a vast technical knowledge on guitars and servicing. However to me, the presentation of the material, viewed from an instructional standpoint, is very disappointing. This lies both in the organization of the material (it jumps all over the place) and the vagueness or lack of clarity in which the instruction is presented. If your intent is as mine, to find a book that gives you straightforward clearly defined steps in setting up a guitar then you may be disappointed in this book. The author makes an honest effort to do this but then falls victim to too many ambiguous and indistinct phrases. The material is there but you may have to reread it numerous times to try and extract the actual intent of the text."
5,Must Read for Players,I have Erlewines other great book on setting up guitars. This is also a great book. Very informative and surprisingly entertaining.
3,too much detail in some areas and not enough in others,"When setting up my guitar, I found myself looking for more information and pictures that this book does not have. However, it is very detailed and provides many great insights, such as, creating some of your own guitar tech tools and the tricks of professionals. Instead of simply having a section about adjusting the action on an acoustic guitar, I had to jump around throughout the book, and was still left with many unanswered questions. However, the sections on setting up an electric were much more detailed, all in one place, and easier to follow."
4,informative and friendly,"I agree with all the other positive comments (that would be all the other reviews) and I have one minor problem with the writing style: he keeps saying you should ""get a professional to fix it"" if you have any doubts about your own abilities... I wouldn't be reading the book if I just wanted to get someone else to do the work!I reffretted my acoustic that I've had for almost 20 years using this book and it plays better than ever! I learned a lot about many other aspects of repair that I might never use (and wouldn't have thought about on my own) but am glad I know now."
5,"If you own or play guitar, you must own this book!!","This is a MUST OWN book for anyone who plays guitar, even casually. Step-by-step instruction how to do the simplest repairs like changing strings, to more difficult and technical like how to install new pickups and wiring...and everything in between.Just the chapter on how to set-up your guitar makes the book worth buying!You will NOT be disappointed!"
4,Good Guitar Player Repair Guide,This book is very usefull to all luthiers and to the guitar players like me. I'm studying at B&H Luthier's School in Brazil and this book was highly recomended for all students.
1,Don't waste your money,I've been playing guitar for quite a while and finally got the notion to learn how to set up and upgrade my guitars. The author skims over a lot of information. I agree with most of the other 3 stars or less reviews in that this is no way a step-by-step guide to doing anything. I surfed the net quite extensively and found instructions for exactly what I want to do.
4,$44? $37?,These sellers are out of their god damn minds you can get this book brand new at any bookstore for no more than $22.95 + tax. Don't buy from these guys are they are just trying to rip you off.
4,Title is misleading . . .,Since I bought this book I haven't been able to repair even one guitar player. :(
4,The Toff is back!,"Richard Rollinson-the Toff to the underworld and the police departments of a dozen counties-had received many threats against his life, but never one that frightened him half so much as the warning from the golden-haired boy. There was insanity in his voice, and it seemed that only insanity could plan a series of profitless robberies. Would the Toff's death seem equally insane?"
2,Okay.,"You pretty much get what you pay for. In the case of this laptop, you don't even get that.It is powerful enough for just about anything(other than gaming) that most people do, with its Celeron M processor.The screen quality is bad. The bottom part of it leaks a lot.It is entirely out of plastic, so definitely not sturdy. Mine bends, etc.Quite heavy, not for carrying around, yet not powerful enough to be a desktop replacement.My DVD player no longer plays dvd's without major skipping. This is probably party due to the 150 CD's I have burnt with it.So if you want a budget laptop, and find a good deal(ie. around ~$200) then get it. It can take a beating, with a few minor things going wrong.There are better laptops out now for cheaper than this, with Dual-Core processors, etc. If you can, get them, as this is now an 'old' laptop."
5,Just what I needed...,This was a replacement for an old cell phone battery. It works just like advertised.
1,terrible battery -- don't buy it!,"My husband and I have two Motorola Razr V3s, and we needed new batteries. These batteries have never held a charge since we got them. They were a total waste of money. It's almost like not having a battery at all. If I charge the phone, and then get a call, my phone is beeping ""low battery"" within 10 minutes. Terrible. I am now ordering the same batteries from another seller, and I will never order anything else from this seller."
1,"Authentic battery, just won't hold a charge","I was actually surprised to receive what looked to be an authentic Motorola battery. Unfortunately, it does not hold a charge any better than the original that needs replacing. I imagine this ""replacement"" is just as old as the one in my phone, which would explain why it isn't any better.Don't waste your money."
1,Don't buy it,Don't bu itThe battery was completely different in size to the one my Motorola V300 has.Dealing with the company is not easy.The RMA is not the trouble.R
4,Ordered SNN5794A Battery Received SNN5777A Battery,"Ordered SNN5794A 780 mAh battery as indicated on web page and received SNN5777A 740 mAh battery instead. The date on the new battery is three months older than the original SNN5794A battery shipped with my V3m phone back in 2006. So far the new battery is holding a charge for several days, however the talk time appears to be slightly less than the battery it replaced. Also the USPS shipping was more than the battery itself, but I did receive it within a week of placing the order. Overall the battery appears to be working well and the price including the cost for shipping was right compared to the $20+ that my provider wanted for a replacement battery."
2,No better than the old one it replaced,"Lucky if it would hold a charge for a day, with 30 minutes of use. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Poor quality,Did not work well. Need to dump. Provided less than a half hour battery life. I do not recommend buying this product.
2,So - So,"Purchased two batteries so that I might keep one charged while using the other. Unfortunately it turned out to be lucky that I ordered two batteries because when they arrived only one took a charge while the other came up as ""Incorrect battery"" on the phone's screen. The price was far less than I had expected and so I did not bother to return the defective battery. The vendor's response to the order was exceedingly prompt."
1,Junk,I bought this to replace a battery in my cell phone. It does not hold a charge very well at all. It seems to me that these batteries are a waste of resources on the road to toxic waste.I cannot recommend this product at all.
5,OE replacement battery,Battery is exactly like the factory battery that came in my old Motorola Razor. Works great. Now I can use my ancient phone for another 4 years. :)
5,Great Value for Motorola Users,"Still holding onto an aging Motorola V400, Death by Battery was a common experience. Replacement batteries, from the local mall kiosk or retailer, can eat up dollars that could go toward a new mobile phone.Amazon's vendor partner shipped genuine Motorola batteries, that last a whole week instead of a few hours, or a few calls. I bought two and keep the second one handy... and fully charged. ""Always on"" is my new motto.The very low price per battery ends months of frustration, and will tide me over until AT&T; provides an ideal upgrade for the Motorola V400 line."
5,Battery,This is a battery for an old phone and it was a help being able to purchase one at a reasobable price.
5,good product,i think that this company is doing a great job and i would recommend them to any of my friends
5,Works Great,This fits in my phone perfectly and holds a charge. I feel like my phone is brand new again!!!
2,Not any better,Two stars because they were shipped well packed and on time but these were not any better than the one that came out of the phone. I know my phone is old but I was hoping these batteries would have the life of new batteries. They did not.
1,bad product,I purchased in August and it worked very well. Flash forward four months and now it's useless! Unfortunately not surprised...thankfully this mistake only cost me $5.17!
4,Good service,"i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced. i love it' thank you amazon for having it in stock."
1,OEM Batteries are junk,I bought the OEM Batteries and when they arrived the manufacture date was 2006. When charged they only lasted about 1 and a half days. I sent them back and requested more and they were worse. One was swollen and the cover wouldn't fit on. It only would last 4 hours. The other was dated 2007 and would last about a day and a half. These are junk!! Don't buy them!
2,Inconsistent quality,"It's actually the second battery. The first one had been working pretty good for about two weeks until I accidentally dropped my phone in the water while fishing. I get it out almost immediately, by something has happened - I couldn't charge the battery anymore: ""unable to charge"" was the message on the phone. Fortunately, I kept my original battery that came with the phone, and it was still working - it just required frequent recharging (that's why I replaced it). So I ordered a second battery, but have had trouble with this one from day one. Some times, after numerous tries, I can get it charged, but most of the time it just doesn't work. So I'm back to my original battery and, most likely, will buy a new phone when I'm fed up with recharging every other day... Bottom line: it's an inconsistent, low quality product - you may get lucky like some people have, but equally probable you may get a piece of junk."
2,Not as good as original,This battery does not have as much capacity as the original. Its charge doen't last more than a day of standby.
1,Terrible!!,"The battery that I got did not hold a charge for long, and never did. I was very disappointed and cannot recommend this to anyone!"
5,Cell Lounge is wonderful!,Wonderful company to do business with! They go the extra mile to make sure that you are satisfied with their product. Battery works great! Thanks Cell Lounge:)
5,i got 4,i did buy 5 motorola for my v3m cause im on call 24/7im the boss of crown emergency service i got a use cell for $ 20 the battery olny give me 2h if keep it on i when i was talk on my cell the better olny give me olny 30min talking on a full better i put the new beter in my v3m i can be on my cell for 4h but i can keep my cell on for 5 days on a fill better i got 5 better for $25 i did get all 5 better in 4 days that was a fast service buy the mail man thay did tex me and give me a e-mail tell me it be on it way and how many days it take get me my home all my purchased i got on time with fast service from crownemergencyservice
3,decent battery,"I bought this battery a few weeks ago. It is not perfect, but it is better than spending $40 on a new battery. The charge lasts for 2-3 days, but the problem I have had is that with the new battery, my phone turns itself off if it gets bumped. This loose connection may or may not be the fault of the battery."
2,No better than battery it was to replace.,"Not much to say really, I bought the battery, which was half the thickness of the the previous two batteries I have purchased, charged it for 10 hours, and found it had no more life to it than the battery that came with my i90c. Since then I have purchased a new Sprint Centro and everything is working fine.I wouldn't recommend buying this battery unless the one you have is dead and you have no other choices."
2,A little bet better than the old one.,"Shipping was prompt. The battery is a little bit better than the old one. It last the whole day, whereas the three-year old one would not. But, it doesn't last several days as a new battery ought to do."
2,No Better Than 3 Year Old Battery,"This ""new"" battery holds a charge for less than a day with little or no usage. About the same as the original 3 year old battery. I could have just used the old one for the same performance."
2,These batteries are worthless,I bought one of these batteries and it would not hold a charge. They sent me a second battery and it was even worse. After an overnight charge it only lasted long enough for a 30min call before my phone died. I am now waiting for a refund.
1,Defective Battery,The battery lasted a little more than 3 months and then it wouldn't hold a charge. OEM could care less since 30 days had passed. The original battery lasted more than 3 years.
1,Don't buy this item,"Please don't buy this product. I tried it since my battery, after 2 years, had to be charged everyday. From the moment that I started using it I didn't notice any difference, it was just like having the old battery, and after using it for 2 weeks it turned out to be even worse than the old battery, so now I'm using again the old one. I also went to check if the problem was with the phone, but no, it is this battery."
3,HIt and Miss,"We bought two of these and one worked just fine it lasted all day, but the other one only lasted half and hour after charging it for several hours!"
5,excellent !!!!,"I bought this battery from OEM4LESS, I was impressed by their service. The first battery I received is not new and I contact them right away, they appogy and ship the replacement battery right away. The new battery works fine and I'm very happy with their prompt response."
1,Bad Battery,Shipping was fast. The Motorola battery was horrible!!! The battery will not keep a charge more than 1 hour before dying. If the phone is used the battery may last 12 minutes.BEWARE of older batteries even if they are supposed to be new. I want to believe that this is a brand new battery but must've an expired shelf life. If new batteries expire you kinda stuck and just have to break down and get a new phone.Because my wife likes this phone I am hoping for another battery that will work to be shipped to me overnight because I trashed the original...but we'll see.
1,What battery?,Received a dead battery. Emailed DLN. They said they'd send another one out pronto. No battery. Emailed they again last week. No contact. Bought on 2/11/10. Contacting Paypal to retrieve my $.
1,1-month life only,I only just started using this battery. Battery stopped holding a charge after 1 month. Do not purchase this item. I suspect it was reconditioned.
1,OEM Cell Battery,"My cell phone is a 2006 and works great except my battery is 4 years old, so I bought a new one... that is never used one apparently because it was not new. It was manufactured in 2007 and would only hold a charge for 24 hours before needing to be recharged. That is the same for my 4 year old battery that I already have. I guess that is why it is so cheap. I asked for a refund and I got my money back. Guess I am going to have to upgrade my phone after all."
2,Weak Battery,I purchased a raz battery and it is weak. Charge lasts 3-5 days and they say 4-6 is normal.They said I could return the battery at my cost with no offer of replacement.They answered all emails with consistent defense of their product.
5,Hoagy's timeless tunes reinterpreted!,"This review is for the Concord release, not the RCA. For some unknown reason Amazon is crossposting these reviews to both. They are two completely different releases differing in content and performers.Mostly lighthearted and breezy, these ten 'cool jazz' recordings from the contemporary Concord discography form a tribute album of sorts. This is a fun disc -- a real pick-me-up for overcast moods or days. A great mix of vocals and instrumentals. Quite enjoyable. Have no fear getting this one."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I HAVE ORDERED ZINO FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT SOURCES AND NEVER !!!! HAVE BEEN DIS SATISFIED. ACTUALLY I WAS DELIGHTED THAT THE FRAGRANCE WAS LIKE IT WAS MADE 25 YEARS AGO. IT WAS PERFECT !!!! THIS LAST ORDER HOWEVER, SMELLS LIKE SOME TYPE OF DOG WASH. I WILL RETAIN THE 3 BOTTLES THAT I ORDERED TO FRESHEN UP MY CAT LITTER BOX. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I AM MORE THAN DISAPPOINTED. I AM ""PISSED"" AT MYSELF FOR ORDERING 3 BOTTLES. 12.6 OUNCES OF PURE GARBAGE....MINUS MY $93.00 SPENT."
3,Good daypack with one little problem,"The size is perfect for a daypack for traveling. I just spent 2 weeks in Turkey and the pack was perfect for touring/hiking during the day. It also worked well on the days when I needed to pack for the beach. I liked that it has two main compartments instead of one huge compartment where everything is all jumbled up. The elastic band in the front was handy for tying up my shoes when I went wading in water, to the beach, a sweater when it got too hot, etc. The one but crucial negative is that the zippers are not of sturdy quality. A few days into my trip, my new backpack already had problems zipping up. The zipper in question still works but it catches easily and generally, I have to treat it gingerly. It looks like the backpack will last a very long time but will be useless because I do not think the zippers are going to make it."
4,College Bookbag,"I've uses this bag for 3 years now, and it's holding up fine, I think it has got a few more in it. The only thing id even comment on are the bungees on the front, they're rather useless."
3,Needs subtitles,"Excellent singing throughout. However, without English subtitles, the total effect of the arias was mimimized. I suppose it costs too much to do that all the time. Overall, however, the DVD shows Placido Domingo at his best in a repetoir he calls his own."
5,Magnificent,"American Forests and his earlier book Petrified Wood are amazingly beautiful books. I have seen a few of the petrified wood samples in museums which are shown in these books, and the photoimages correspond to the authentic samples. I have two other petrified wood photo books that I have loaned out but I don't remember their titles (mostly chapters by German authors). Daniels two books are the very best. Howard McPherson"
5,Another Daniels Classic,"A definitive work on the phenomenon of petrified wood. Ancient Forrests focuses on the science of petrified wood. It has an amazing wealth of photographs. Many focus on the grain patterns and the amazing detail that can be found in the many different species of petrified wood. There are also many whole specimens and overviews of famous wood collections such as the Murphy collection at the Rice Museum in Portland Oregon. If you are at all interested in Petrified wood, this is a must-have book, Beautiful!"
1,slipknot is awsome but beware of this version,i am a slipknot fan and have all their cd sept this one well have the digi pack and origanal i bought this to hear lost tracks that are very rare like purity i just got it but to my suprise lookd at the back no frail limb nursery and no purity i want a refund so i can buy the real one
1,"Slipknot: All Brawn, NO BRAINS!",Useless garbage. All the guy does is scream at the top of his lungs. Have you ever wondered how much times the f-word can be used on a CD? You'll be surprised when you hear this! Slipknot takes out melody and music and replaces them with ear-splitting noise. The nine guys give me a headache. The guitarist are terrible. They play the same boring riffs over and over. These guys are untalented. If this is the shape of metal to come...
1,NOT ALL THAT GOOD !,"THIS GROUP OF GUYS ARE PHONY.LIMP,KORN,DISTURBED,KID ROCK ARE THE WONDERS OF THE ROCK RAP LIFE AND SLIPKNOT CAN'T BITE ON THEM."
1,Slip-NOT,What the hell is the matter with you people?Did Daddy not play with you when you was a little boy.Why so angry?Someone would have to be pretty mad to spend 15 dollars of someones hard earned cash on this.What the hell?
1,Boring,"I can't understand why this band is popular, they are just another dime a dozen ""RAGE"" band.The good thing is that they will meet the same fate as all the eighties hair bands....an early grave!"
1,SLINGING SNOTT,"slinging snot is what this cd will have you doing only after a few songs. it's hard to understand why so many are taken in by bands such as these slipknot, mudstain i mean mudvayne, static cling oops static x, bands like these have the same tuned down guitars, the vocals all sound like someone sitting on the toilet trying to squeeze out a turd. the same chords are played throughout the entire cd, no guitar solos, what happened to the days when bands had guitar solos? the whole look of the band makes them look like they should be in the circus, underground metal does not get radio air play, that should be your first clue this is not metal stay away from this cd and others like it. boring,un-original, just lame."
4,great debut,"At first I balked at picking this up because I thought this is another band with some goofy gimmick. However, the first half of this CD blew me away. Many influences come through, yet they create something unique. The second half of this cd doesn't come close to the first--but it's still worth buying."
5,THE BEST ALBUM IN A REALLY LONG TIME!!!! BEST BAND EVER!!,"NOW THIS IS WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT!!! There are no words to descriebe how damn amazing SlipKnot is!!!! I have been following them since like Mid 1998. You have no Idea how long I have been waiting for their album!! I got it like on release date, and I wasn't disapointed AT ALL!! Anyone who says that this band sounds like KoRn is an Idiot!!! SlipKnot is SLIPKNOT!! Not a KoRn Clone!!! Anyone who says they sound like Limp Bizkit is even stupider! Limp Bizkit is one of the worst bands in the world, they can't touch the talent of SlipKnot!! I have seen them live and their is no band that puts more emotion and raw energy in their performance!! I also met all NINE of them, and they are sooo down to earth and cool!! They signd my album and a small poster I got. There are no band tracks on the album. SlipKnot are going to explode!! Watch out, cuz they will be killer!! BEST BAND EVER!!!"
4,"Really, Really good.","Forget those panzee bands Korn and Limp Bizkit and go straight for Slipknot! When I first heard them I was thinking ""What is this? "" and then after ""Wait and Bleed"" and ""Surfacing"" I was thinking ""This rocks! "". Granted much like Full Metal Jacket (war movie)falls apart after they leave the boot camp, this album kinda falls apart after ""Liberate"". Thus the 4-star rating. Up to ""Liberate"" the album is a 5-star but once it enters into ""Prosthetics"" it is a 4-star. I dig the costumes too. But if ya got kids or younger siblings (like me) keep it far away from em! If you like Metal in any way then pick this up now!"
5,sound nothing like korn!,"this cd is awesome. it is finely crafted into a blazing masterpiece of fury and rage and represents the peak of modern metal. korn sucks in comparison with slipknot. they have a couple of good songs, but slipknot has them beat in every department."
1,"I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT ZERO STARS, BUT YOU CAN'T!!!!!","I don't uderstand it, so many people are obsessed with the stupidest band in the world!!! If you want to listen to metal which is more creative and exciting than this, listen to Fear Factory. All whoever the hell the singer is just screams. IT GETS OLD REALLY FAST!!!!!"
3,"Too identical to Korn, but still OK","If you like roaring and screaming and you hate society, this is definitely the CD for you. Coupled by eerie sounds and language you wouldn't want your parents to hear, this is the metal album to end all metal albums. I would definitley consider this album to be on top of the hardcore ""ladder."" The lyrics were fairly decent and the music, or should I say sounds, weren't half bad. This would be great to listen to if you were throwing a temper tantrum. In one of the songs it goes ""you think about killing everyone, but you never do"" or something like that. Yeah, it really sort of packs a punch if you know what I mean. Anyway, if your taste in music meets the guidelines I discussed in the beggining, you'll have a blast with this."
5,I wish there were more bands like this,"Slipknot(consisting of 9 members)uses all of the members skills to their full power,and I think thats what makes them better than the rest.How can I describe their music? Well I would like to think of it as heavy metal mixed with a harmonic voice(most of the time its screaming)& turntables. The cover itself is cool. The fact they give you lyrics to understand the song (maybe even sing along,hahaha) makes the CD even better. When I listen to Slipknot it makes me want to jump into a moshpit. All in all, I wish there were more bands like Slipknot."
5,I TRULY FELT THE HATE RISE UP IN ME,"Brilliant stuff.From start to finish this album will rock the cells out of your body.Wait and bleed,surfacing,spit it out,liberate and no life are just some of the amazing songs that this album has to offer.Play this album as loud as it can be played coz SLIPKNOT ROCK,All u metal fans out there{who dont already have this album},go get it."
3,great but...,"The musics fine, fierce aggressive metal with hints of other genres, but are these guys still going to be ponsing around in costumes when their 10th album comes out? It just all seems childish to me and drags the image of metal back many years. Mind you, its a gimmick which works as i've just bought a ticket to their concert..."
5,fast and furious...GREAT CD!!!,"this cd is a kick a** cd. slipknot is a kick a** band too.this cd has sum reelly great songs on it. The best songs on this one would probably have to be, ""(sic)"",""Wait And Bleed"",""Eyeless"", and ""Spit It Out"". Those songs are teh standout songs.But the rest of the songs rock.If u want a good metal CD go out and buy this one.It rocks.Slipknot rocks!!!"
5,BRILLIANT HARDCORE MUSIC!,"The first time I heard this band it just blew my f***n mind. I am a fan of heavy, hardcore, thrash metal, and Slipknot is one of the hardest bands I've ever heard! Get this CD and turn up the volume on your stereo!!!"
3,So this is were the pulse fo the maggots began.,At first look I could not stand this band they dressed like a boy band from hell and there was like 30 members. But I started to listen to the lyrics and Corey Taylor knows what he is doing. This cd was full of energy and aggresion and very unpolished. Thier fans are loyal and thier peers are afraid for a while this band ruled the metal scene.
4,Slipknot,"The most amazing, groun shaking music ever. If you want to experience intensity,listen to Slipknot. Breath defying, with awesome samples, and guitar riffs. And what can I say about the drumming, simply unmatched!"
4,Slipknot... their debut,"I know there are many people out there who don't like this band. I know that a lot of people who think that they have no talent. I'm not saying that they're an extremely talented band, they are too mainstream and their instruments aren't complex enough. I am giving them 4 stars because they succeed in entertaining me, and I enjoy listening to them. That's all."
4,Don't let this be your 1st metal experience.,"I am giving Slipknot S/T a 4 star because of originality, no, not just for the masks. Slipknot makes some darn good music, it's fast and very err.. um, loud? The lyrics are very aggressive and the drumming.. Joey tears the place up! The songs are good, most of them at least.. I'll say it like this, if you like metal you should own this album. Listen to it, you'll probably like but don't waste your $$$ on Iowa, which is terrible. The downside the slipknot is that for having 9 people the music isn't exactly technical. Here's how slipknot is...Drums everywhere, Drums everywhere, noise, noise, noise.. quick crapy guitar solo.. for having 9 people it's a wonder they can play on the same beat all the time. so you've got to give them some credit for that but.. for having 9 people the music should be better. you want a good 9 piece band? Mushroomhead, see, they all play instruments..(ok they're only 8 people, yah, big difference.)"
5,REAL,"Many people call slipknot sellouts; that's because they are so popular now. But how can such a good band stay unnoticed forever? This cd is very good. For a 1st cd, (""Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat"" doesn't count) Slipknot's self-titled albumn sounds like they have been around for a long time and they are very deserving of their rank as one of the most popular metal bands of '99....at the Tattoo the Earth tour they even played last after such bands as sevendust, sepultura, and slayer. Even though all the teenie bopper fakes out there want to SAY they like slipknot, slipknot is still awesome. This cd is a good example of what well-thought out lyrics along with heavy music can be. BUY IT NOW (if you aren't just a wannabe freak)"
5,Get up and buy this cd!,"I first heard about Slipknot from Wickedland.com so i went to amazon and listened to some of there songs. i was amazed and still am. this is a raw and aggressive album that will keep you wanting more. the vocals are reminising of korn, but Korn doesn't compare, and i love korn. Buy this album"
3,didn't hit me like it should have,"i was eager to buy slipknot's first release since i heard one of their songs (spit it out) before, but tell the truth, it was not up to par. it was not original as i thought it was going to be. the lead singer just reminded me of jonathan davis too much, and the band had that whole insane clown posse look going. but i think this is a band to look out for, i mean, how many hardcore or metal bands can boost that they have nine members. and the jungle and turntable touches were really cool. if you want some decent music to annoy people not down hardcore style pick this cd up."
5,WOW! it just ROCKS!,"I just bought this CD yesterday and I've probably listened to it 6 times already. It just rocks hard and Furious from start to finish. if you're a metal fan and liked korn's heavier stuff or coal chamber you can't go wrong. buy it, hear it, you will be pleased. that's all there is to it."
4,Pretty good band,"I'm not really much into the new stuff but slipknot caught my ear and I decided to give their music a try. The sound is diffrent from alot of bands and this is some heavy stuff. In my opinion this is the best Slipknot album. It's way better than Subliminal versus. Songs that are good are (sic), surfacing, and liberate. And for the guy that said that they're trying to be like korn, I respect korn but slipknot and korn have way diffrent sounds. You need to get your ears checked because this album is more heavier."
5,Perfection,"The best sounding and most talented hardcore band I have heard to date. That's all I can say about Slipknot. I shouldn't even have to review it, since the album screams for itself. I just hope MTV doen't corrupt them like they have so many others (I still remember when listening to KoRn made me an outcast)."
2,Not as good as everbody makes it out to be.,(...) this album is chock full of death metal and bad lyrics. Honestly I mean these guys have NO talent and they were on the cover of Rolling Stone! I mean I think if somebody gave me a guitar and said sing a song while you make the guitar scream I could do better and I've no idea how to play a guitar! Don't let all the hype get to you don't buy this unless you love a bad noise in your ears. Instead buy Nine Inch Nails or Mozart or Linkin Park or Marilyn Manson-REAL artists! And I have heard all of the songs on this CD and I sadly own it.
3,"It's good, but...metal?","This album is pretty curious because everyone has a curiosity to hear it, and I don't blame them. It's got excellent drumming, and the sampler is great. However, this album gets old. Everyone calls it to be so raw, so emotional. Please, give me a break. And what's with the calling Slipknot to be metal? these guys are as metal as Blink 182. If you want some real heavy metal, get yourself some Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Pantera, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Sepultura, Mercyful Fate, Morbid Angel, and 80s Metallica. If you're looking for metal, don't go looking on this cd. Still good, but not metal."
2,Not so good,"I think it's rather 'trick or treat' instead of 'wait and bleed'. It's alot of fast mumbling (throughout the whole album) with weak guitars. It does have nice drums though. But it's just another imitation of Limp Bizkit, KoRn, Deftones and Static-X together in one band. No originality, just faster and more mumbling."
3,uuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhh ok,ok listen and listen good i like heavy metal ilike death metai like it all but slipknot is ok it's just stuff i've heard be fore oh well at least it's not eminem
5,pretty cool,These guys do got guts and are pretty impressive. I like em a lot and hope they go on tour one more time cuz I missed em the first time around.
5,You can't get any much better than this!!!,"I saw them at OzzFest in Kansas City, MO, and they were the first band I saw there. They kicked major a**!!! The Drums are my favorite part, because there are so many of them. 3. Who would of thought of that??? 9 members, and they all kick a$$!!! Great CD! I'll have the next one in a flash!! Can't wait!"
4,one of the most vile albums i have heard in a long time,"I first heard this band on a music channel. And to be honest i thought it was the best i have ever heard. The song was spit it out. that song compares nothing to the rest of the album. It's vile, it's in your face, and it grabs you by the nuts. You feel the hate and adrenilyn in every song. It tops every album for origionality. so do a favor get the album and abuse everyone."
1,About as dull as a chicken recipe.,"This so-called nu metal band is trash, I Can't believe that kids are listen to this s***, it is horrendous, stupid and repetitivedull songs, dull singing and rapping, this is lameif you think nu metal is the future of rock n roll think againLike the band cathedral, Death to nu metal.SLIPKNOT SUCKS"
1,the other trendies,"I have listened to extreme music for a long time now, and never have I heard such utter crap in my entire life. The only good this album can do is to help tell the true metal fans from the trendies who think its fasionable. Slipknot have killed metal. Death to trendy metal fans! Death to false metal!"
1,this wont get you through life,"Whats wrong with you poeple, this band will tear your life apart. When you listen to this santan enters your body dosen't care about you he want's you to hate God so, you follow him. becsuse he wants every soul.To proff he is more powerful then god.So follow this life of good or evil,evil makes you feel diirty and good makes you feel clean.so what would you want to be dirty or clean. I think you know the anser.Go to your local book store and buy a bible.I use to love this band but they made me feel dead in side, like im not even human.Follow god good will happen,follow the devil rot in a buring cage for ever.Every body has the power to change,becase people folling god makes you happy.I have a feeling alot of you will hate my review.but i'll take that risk.I listen to this bands that made me happy. Flashpoint (on the verge)Apartment 26(music for the massive)and cellophane."
1,Oh My God!,"If you ask me, the only song worth listening to on this entire CD is Wait and Bleed. I heard a live version of Wait and Bleed, and I decided to buy the CD. It is bad, really really bad. I like noise like everybody else, but this just does NOT make any sense, you can barely make out any of the lyrics. The music wasn't even good."
5,"Slipknot is the best of the past year, easily.","Do you like that rock/rap style that the Beastie Boys started, and Limp Bizkit and Korn have perfected? Ready to take it a step further? ;) Slipknot combines rappish lyrics and beat (along with mixing and sampling) with the lead vocals of Pantera and the deep, guttural guitar riffs of doom metal (ie. Metallica). The lyrics, while having a rap cadence to them, mostly talk of death, pain, and suffering, just like any doom metal band would. But throw in a bit of that rap beat and cadence, and you have something entirely different. These are 8 guys from Iowa, of all places, but these aren't any farm boys I've ever known! I highly recommend this CD. To Korn fans: Think there's nothing better than Korn out there? Slipknot may just have them beat."
4,you like rule,i guess you like rule i believe your album is cool i guess i think there is 9 people in the band i'm not too sure i think i/m getting your cd for christmas i only saw it but i'm not to sure i guess
1,Hmmm...........,"I bought this CD recently hoping for some great metal. That's not what I got. All the songs sound the same, and the guitars are so dry and lifeless. The background sound FX are weird and pointless. The worst part though is the ""singing"". Slipknot are less a band than a noisy gaggle of maggots who don't know how to play their instruments. Why don't people get some GWAR if they want good music. All in all, this was a crappy CD by a crappy band. Don't buy it. KoRn blows Slipknot right out of the water."
1,AWESOME!,I luve tis albim. I gayve et one stear becuze it is #1! Slipknot is gooder then alll otter binds evin StaticX and Venilla Ise. De only problim is eye dwopedd da albim in da toilette onne dai and now it smelz bad.
4,masked kids banging pots and pans!!1,"SLIPNOT IS nOT DEATH METAL,,,, THEREFORE IT SUX...Seriously, if you're going to listen to this album, don't pre-judge the music based on the image, have an open mind and be prepared to accept the fact that there are people who don't have the same opinions and tastes as you.No, it's not the next best thing since Led Zeppelin, Queen, Michael Jackson, or any other artist of a completely different style, but it is a good first effort."
1,want thrash? listen to slayer,"these people try to be good but they arent... at all. they have no musical skill and there songs arent all that good. they too have become sell outs. they will be on trl. trl=sellout. they are reeeeeeally bad. Want good thrash? listen to slayer. exodus. mercyful fate. megadeth. i could go on. and to those of you who think that thrash bands have no skill, that is because you listen to slipknot."
1,"Yes, I can open my mind...","But sometimes too much is just too much.Slipknot, nine guys from Des Moines, Iowa, were considered great. They came with high recommendations from everybody I knew. So, I bought it.I know this is supposed to be heavy, but there is a difference between heavy and try-hard, music and noise. This album crosses the boundaries.I call this album just a bunch of noise. I like heavy, I listen to Slayer, but this is just noise. Screaming and noise. I just can't handle that kind of junk.Slipknot's newest album, Vol 3: The Subliminal Messages, is a good example of a good Slipknot album. It is much more matured and has depth. I highly recommend that one."
1,WOW! SLIPKNOT IS SO HEAVY!,"Yeah, right. I can't believe some people think Slipknot is the heaviest band on the planet. There are heavier bands out there that are being ignored and spat upon because people are listening to Slipknot and making them believe it's the only metal band that exists. All Slipknot is doing is making their fans think they're hardcore while the people that are into real metal are laughing at them. Even bands from the 80s make Slipknot look like whiny little wimps(80s metal is better than nu-metal!). Note to people who listen to rap: just because someone listens to heavy metal, it does not mean that person listens to Slipknot. Slipknot is a disgrace to heavy metal. Fans will be reading this and calling me names and all that crap, but that's not going to do a thing. That will just make me hate Slipknot even more. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to listen to real metal."
1,"People change, bands don't","I use to love this cd, but then it started sounding like everything else. CLICHE"
3,These guys scare me!,Slipknot is a bad band. They look like the kids who attacked me on Halloween and stole my shoes. Their masks are so fake...everyone knows that they aren't real. I like Bait & Cheese cause that is a good song. GUTTER! I'm going to fly outta here...ROCKSTEDDY!
3,"eh,not bad","This does not suck really but i hate all the stupid rap but the screams and drumming is sure good.This is the only album they were rap/metal huh, rap metal it's not even metal,anyway this is not their best cause iowa is way different than this one no more rap and hell it doesn't even sound nu metal just ""METAL"".and for vol 3 not as good than iowa but kinda cool and for this one just check it out rap sucks big time but listen to the hard stuff.OH AND FOR THAT DUDE WHO HATES BLACK METAL WELL FOR YOU'RE INFORMATION SLIPKNOT LOVES IT ESPECIALLY JOEY HE'S BEEN A DRUMMER FOR BLACK METAL HAHAHAHAHAHA!GOOD THING THEY DON'T SOUND LIKE THIS ANYMORE WELL THE RAP OF COURSE.OH AND YEAH IT'S FAKE METAL BUT LISTEN TO THE HARD STUFF,I LISTEN TO THEM AND CALLED THEM GAY"
3,"Not quite groundbreaking, but still worth listening to.","Out of 15 songs, only about 7 of them are truly worth the dead presidents[ (SIC), Eyeless, Wait and Bleed, Spit it Out, Purity, Prosthetics, and the secret song available on some CDs) I'm not saying the rest of them were no good; there was just nothing really ""grabbing"" about some of them. However, it is clearly a sophisticated class act compared to the overrated and moronic Limp Bizkit. So, not a great album, just a GOOD one."
1,NOT METAL!!!!!,"I agree. This crap is definitely not metal. I'm sick and tired of every 15 year old kid thinking that metal is rap music with guitars. That's all it is - rap, or shall I say crap. Also, Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Kid Rock are not metal either. If you want to hear some real metal listen to Judas Priest or Iron Maiden and get this garbage out of your head. For society's sake, please stop."
5,SLIPKNOT RULES!!!,"Sipknot is one of the best new bands coming out of the ""new"" metal scene. I've seen them at Ozzfest and have their demo and they F***ing rock. This album is definitely something you should pick up. It's gonna kill!!!"
1,Not Good Enough,"Apparently, Slipknot managed to make good sales thanks to the amount of advertising and merchandise they've been doing. Overall, this CD is not what I'd expect a good hardcore heavy metal band to be. Slipknot does have a few good songs here and there or in one part of a song but it's just not good enough guys. Although a good start for the band, if they keep up the way they started, then problems will begin to occur. Slipknot is only recommended for you if you're the kind of person to enjoy moshing. Otherwise, avoid purchasing this CD completely. You'll be disappointed as I was."
2,Terribly Overrated,"Ok. i bought this disc when it first came out. it was ok. nothing special. then somehow these guys became very popular. why? they're nothing special.I saw them perform live at the Tattoo the Earth tour with slayer. Somehow Slipknot wound up with a 60 minute set, and Slayer, a much more skilled band, with a 50 minute set. That is an insult that some trendy ""metal"" band gets a longer playing time than such an incredible band as Slayer. This is an OK band, but i find they have a much too industrial sound than they should. And the lyrics are just boring. And the masks are irritating...not scary. If you think they are, perhaps buy the backstreet boys album? If you're simply looking for scary, buy Deicide. If you want REAL metal...i suggest slayer...maybe even pantera or sepultura."
4,-,"...Slipknot is the best CD out there right now you can get. Soforget all the publicity [about other bands]... I admit, i hated this music at first cuz [of] donning eye-catching jumpsuits and masks to sell their albums. Not the case at all, these guys truly rock and you NEVER get bored of their songs like you do with some other bands we all know about. And once you know what they're all about, they will have already sucked you in. This CD is killer at times, but it's not without faults. some songs just make you go like ""what the hell?"" and skip it alltogether to the tracks that keep you up all night."
4,Good to own,"this CD has a lot of pretty good songs. Wait and Bleed and Spit it Out aren't the only good ones. Sic is my favorite. Anyways, if your a fan of Rap-metal(System of a Down, RATM) or Speed metal(Pantera) then you would definately get this CD. If you just like creative music(Nine Inch Nails, Tool, RATM, Deftones, System of A Down) then you might want to borrow it before you buy it."
5,This Album Kiks. It's the best cd to come around in a while.,"Man, If I were you I'd buy this CD. Slipknot is the best CD to come around in a long time. If you like anything from KoRn to System Of a Down You will love this CD. I'd try it if I were you"
4,pretty damn good,"this music is pretty damn good - the actual music is i woulda given it 5 stars but the vocalist screams to much and it gets a little old - surfacing is the best song, and spit it out kicks ass also - go buy it, its worth it"
1,There is much better out there,this band is just another korn/limpbizkit band. nothing orginal. nothing all that good. Bands like the Deftones have much deeper more meeningful songs. all these guys seem to do i yell into the microphone about nothing. But if you want to go with the radio tells you is a good band by all meens buy it. but if you want talent look at another band
1,kinda boring cd,i will stick with the old HARDCORE slipknot.the band that was on REVELATION RECORDS. this cd just didn't do a thing for me.
1,"This is punk, not metal","This piece of crap is punk not metal. Seems like the guitar players only know 1 riff ( like punk ). The vocals sound like every other so called ""death metal"" ( death punk ). I agree with an ealier reviewer, 9 band memebers and this still sucks"
3,Hmmm.....,"Well it seems to me Slipknot have finally done what they kept saying they wouldn't. Sold out. I wouldn't say this album was bad; it has brilliant guitar playing and some good songs, its just that it has been heard all before. However, it is far superior to all the """"""""""nu-metal"""""""""" like LIMP DICKWITS and KORNERDS... anyway if you want some good electric guitar music then check out Early Manic Street Preachers, Nine Inch Nails, and Rage Against The Machine with clever lyrics and not just random swearing...."
1,I now have a headache!,"What the hell is this noise pollution? I don't care what you people say but these guys have made a bad attempt at trying to create a ""Korn meets Deftones"" sound. I know, all you ""so-called"" hardcore metal fans out there will dispute this and say ""you just don't know what you're talking about"" but c'mon, let's keep it real. It sounds as if Slipknot are just trying to go for some guitar speed record. I have to admit, some of the songs show signs of brilliance and good melody but then somewhere along the line they ruin it with unneccesary screaming and tuneless speed guitar riffs. Don't get me wrong, I like heavy riffs and screaming, ala Deftones, but this just does not go over well. I can't wait til the new Deftones comes out. Until then, I'm going to get some more Advil."
5,Slipknot come home!,"I was so impressed by the song ""wait and bleed"" I drove to Wall-Mart and Picked up my on copy and have proudly displayed it in my room to sybolize a master design of lyrics and rythm! But I must confess, I am OUT RAGED AT THE FACT THAT SLIPKNOT IS TO GOOD FOR US SIMPELTONS TO MAKE A FRESHER ALBUM! WERE ARE YOU SLIPKNOT?"
3,Good album...,"I held off getting this album for a while, but I can say its quite refreshing to listen too. If you can lift yourself from the media exposure the band are getting and listen to the album then you can actually appreciate that it is a good album.Granted, its not as friendly as something from Limp Bizkit and its not as brutal as something from Static-X or Biohazard.Good for people who like Fear Factory, but in reflection - Obsolete is a better album than this one.Slipknot are a good band and I'm looking forward to seeing them this August at Reading Festival, UK.The albums good, but albums from Machinehead and Fear Factory are better."
1,Sux.,"A friend played this junk for me recently and it's a joke. It sounds like a 1,000 hair dryers blowing at once, with no sense of musicality or songcraft. It reminds me of the guy from ""Spinal Tap"" who plays the guitar solo with his shoe -- noise for the sake of noise. If I turned up a guitar to full blast and strummed it with a tuna, it would sound just as good. And the guy screaming his lungs up sounds like he's going to have a stroke. Take it easy, Pal. Life ain't that bad. Anyway, save your hard-earned $ on this one and wait for the next Pantera CD."
1,What The F***?,"It is amazing that such garbage like this can be so popular; even more amazing that it takes seven people to produce this sound, even though you can only hear the words. Yes, I call them words because that is all they are. Just profantic words shouted in no sort of rythm and with no sort of pitch. My lawn mower makes more music than this trash. The only good thing I can say about this band is that... um.. I can't remember. It must not have been anyting important. Anyway, this album blows. If you're into this sort of stuff, you have better stuff to spend your money on; like a session with your therapist."
1,Makes you sick,Bleah. I really don't know how the Amazon's reviewer can state slipknot (lowercase due) music is 'surprisingly melodic'. 1 star is really too much: music is a *very* different thing. Please put your slipknots to good use and disappear.
1,not even a one hit wonder,"Quite possibly one of the worst cd's I ever listened to.They dont compare with slayer.At least slayer knows more than 3 chords.Kinda reminds you of korn but even more childish than them.I dont want to lead you wrong but I gave this cd away to a friend who in turn gave it to someone else.It's sad you have to wear masks,curse and bawl that we can't judge you.Ill judge them..losers"
2,"blah, blah, blah",oooh! these guys are scaring me! with those 'crazy' get-ups and all... give it a rest kids. contrived poseur music.
1,Heavy Metal? LOL,"I got this CD in August and at first i kind of enjoyed them but now i cant listen to this anymore. This isnt heavy metal at all. Sure you can say its heavy metal when you compare it to Limp Bizkit and Nsync, but this is not really heavy metal. if you think this is heavy at all you should listen to Thrash/Speed, some Black, some Death, or some Melodic Metal. This is just pop music with louder guitars and a pretty good drummer(I gotta give Joey some credit). the only people that think this is heavy metal are people who have never listened to real metal in their entire lives. and also these guitar riffs are the worst ive ever heard in my life of a pop band like this. and yes they are pop music. this one band is more well known than the whole genre of black metal. also compared to some death and black metal bands, they are not sick people at all. they just have this sic image for publicity."
2,"Good for a thirsty youth, but not much for me.","Ok, I am a metal head. Period. I listen to Pantera, Anthrax, Six Feet Under, OLD (capitalize on old here) Metallica, Slayer, etc. Then, someone said, ""HERE! LISTEN TO THIS!"" Well, it was Korn, and I was impressed by how they fused some hip-hop with thrash metal. BUT, they weren't my favorite. Now, Slipknot . . . well. It's a good fusion band, they've taken some styles and fused them. Now, when I listen to them, I don't really hear something I can be impressed with. I listen to Korn, Marilyn Manson, and other Darkwave style music for the emotion because it is methodical. I listen to OLD Metallica, Slayer, etc,; for the A)Technical compilations B) Speed of the rage. I see don't see true emotion in Slipknot, and I can't relate to them. And for complication . . . well, lacking in it is what they are. They have sped up rage, not much else. A lot of hot air, and not much depth."
2,Nothing special or original,"First off, I'll point out that this is not death metal,despite the fact that the band trys to make it seem that way. Not that I particularly care for that genre, but I have heard some death metal; just one reason why this isn't death metal, at times Corey would go back to his normal voice and just sing or rap, meaning this would not go down in the death metal category. As for the music, it was nothing that good or nothing that I haven't heard before. I do think they have some talent with the drummer(Joey I think his name is) and some decent guitarists who can play their instruments and play them well at times, but do they have to swear every second word? And Corey does have a nice voice when he decides to sing with it. I've heard worse, but I think Slipknot needs to come up with something a little more original."
1,A huge disappointment,"I bought this album after hearing the songs ""wait and bleed"" and ""spit it out"", which are both great songs. I listened to the album twice through and I can honestly say that I didn't find another song that I liked. Apart from the two songs previously mentioned, the whole album was repetative and boring. There is only one upside to the album, the perfect record for moshing!"
4,Aliens From Uranus are Attacking Slipknot!,Wow Wow wow! 11!This is quite possibly the greatest CD ever released by any band ever! It puts pretty much everyone else to shame-or to bed like a 10yr old.....the sound has a blistering pace that makes me think that Slipknot themselves might be from another planet! No human being ws meant to play music this way! It's just so Obscene! Their music just makes me want to--do aerobics or something insane!
3,Overrated,"These guys have tried to make much noise and tear our ears with their screams, and that is what they have actually got. And they do that in quite a fine way: they sound strong and rageous, the recipe has a slight originality. But I have also two negative feelings: I have heard those lyrics anywhere else; in addition, I think that this record would have been much better if they had not tried to sound so aggresive. They have good capabilities, but..."
5,Amazing,"Over the years I have experienced many bands in the hard rock and such genere. But nothing, has made me come back for more then this cd. It's amazing. From the beggining of (sic) to the second part of scissors, this album is great. It's something that breaks away from this whole hard rock genere creating this new wonderful sound. amazing, if you are into this stuff, buy the cd."
5,"Err, dammit this albumn rocks","i bought this because i heard wait and bleed on the drilling the vein vidio and that was exellent so i bought this albumn with the extra tracks and it was equally good. it was different from what i had heard befor, all of there songs were good and i liked the way they wern't all the same style. each song had something a little different which made me want to listen to the whole albumn every time i put it on."
5,Read this,"Whether you like slipknot or not, you cant say nothing about their style. Their music and personas are very innovative, sort of like Kiss was when they were on the rise. Its gotta grow on you for sure. Whens the last time you heard a band like this? Never. And that is why theyre so popular. The old metal is good, but were in the year 2001. People always crave something different and slipknot delivers it in the hugest way. Maybe their second one will change some minds on the direction this type of music is going."
5,hey J.C.,"Hey J.C. you big faggot this cd [...] it does not [...]. and how you say the ""maggots"" can [...] and if you were smart enough maybe you would know that he just wears a gas mask for his gimmick you big retard!!!! Anyone would know that slipknot did brake up and started a new band called Stone Sour which can kick rap and your [...] J.C.! [...]buy this cd its worth the money and Slipknot will be remembered!!!!!"
2,not original,"Slipknot sounds like they are trying to copy the likes of korn instead of come out with there own sound. If they wouldve had their own sound of music and not just copy people it would've turned out a lot better of a cd.They have the potential to be a good/great band, but find a different sound, a sound of their own, until then they are just another band trying to make it big off of some one else's style."
1,Slipknot: band without brains!,"I wouldn't recommend this CD to anyone except someone with the intelligence of Big Bird. Slipknot make a lot of noise. The guitarists have replaced Dimebag Darrel's(Pantera) place as being the worst guitarist in the metal industry. 7 & 4 seriously have no guitar skills. The keyboardist plays no good key-riffs. The bass sounds dry, and the voacls & lyrics are just horrible! Filled with a cussword every other word. Unitelligeble lyrics like: ""I'm gonna f------ kill you!"". Only the three drummers have skill. But the rest just reek! Almost as immature as Pantera. Don't this Cd. Go listen to something else."
4,"Nice Lyrics... not a great sound, but good.","When i picked up this CD I never expected what i was about tolisten to. This is a true band, not sellouts like Limp Bizkit or fakeagonizers like Korn. There is no way to put such feelings into an album unless you really feel like that. ""Get this"" is one of my favorites, agressive, yet melodical in some sense. ""Diluted"" is the best one in the album, lyric-wise and sound-wise. The lyrics to this song are awesome, trully original and poetic. ""Wait and Bleed"" is nice but there are much better songs than this.. this is the bummer song of the CD. ""Surfacing"" is truly an anthem for everyone who has seen the world for real. Depressing, yet uplifting. Get this CD is you care more about content than sound, otherwise, there are better bands than this"
5,Believe It,"Sure, there's a lot of hype behind this band, but it's for a good reason. This is one of the most talented gothic/hardcore-rock bands out there. It's one of those bands that the preps and posers can never have, so they bash it. That doesn't make it bad, they'd just rather listen to N Sync or something like that I guess. Anybody like that has no business writing a review anyway. (This may sound like a rant rather than a review for Slipknot, but it's part of the band's image, so whatever, eh?) Anyway, if your're into hardcore stuff, this is for you."
4,Best Slipknot Album to Date,Slipknot at their best this album rocks on all levels great effects loud a$$ gutiars and fast drum beats. If you dont own this album or Slipknots Iowa or Vol 3 Subliminal Verses then get them I have heard Vol 3 and its not even out yet. Vol 3 is a more mature CD there are a few songs that are soft but all the other songs are heavy and full of great screaming. If you do pick up Slipknots first album pick it up in this format (Digipak) it has demos a live song and a hidden track at the end of the disc great album to own. If you haven't seen them live you are missing out big time they are way better live than in the studio.
3,Hmmm.. Men with masks..,"I first got introduced to Slipknot when I saw heard their sample of 'spit it out' on some music mag's sample cd. Well, I think to myself..""They should be scary no? Perhaps they're music is good."" Well, all I can say is that they are is technical as anyone who wants to start an amateur recording studio. It was a novelty (now it's not), and I'm not saying that their music is bad. They have put in the effort, just not ample to drive my taste. (just my taste.) If you're looking for power, try 'Iowa'. If you're looking to hear how they started, get this. But if you're really tight on cash and is itching for some good music of this genre, I'd suggest Professional Murder Music's self-titled album. Further more, the front-man of Slipknot is getting to be quite a 'pop-icon'. Good for him. Corey Taylor's the name yes?"
5,TONPILS,"Slipknot is the GREATEST band ever. There first self titled cd slipknot was awsome, then they came out with the digipak that has 20 songs and at the end of 20 theres a hidden song called eyore its sic as all hell. anyone thats a slipknot fan should have this cd."
5,Wish I could give it more stars!,"This is the best CD I have. Corey Taylor's insane lyrics give this CD a thrash metal sound. Most of my friends agree with me that they are the best band and probably the best songs are (Sic) and Eyeless. If you like any type of metal, this is a must buy!"
5,I don't normally listen to this music. But pleasantly enjoyed it.,"I grew up as a Hip-Hop head. Listened more to R&B and Soul music. However, I have sinced ventured into a lot of genres of music. Slipknot is in my collection. While this is not for everyone. This is NOT garbage/junk as some people proclaim it to be. There is genuine raw emotion and energy involved behind this music. While I can't always listen to this music, day in, day out. There is a quality that has to be appreciated. There is art behind to it."
5,Slipknot ROCKS!!,"Slipknot is, if not the best, one of the best bands I have ever seen or heard. There was a lot of hype about them at my school, so I bought the album, I was skeptical at first... but Slipknot rocks! If your style of music is rock, punk, rap, hardcore, WHATEVER, you'll love this band!! JUST BUY THE ALBUM!"
4,One of the most in your face albums I own.,"I tell you what. Aside one of Slipknot's single called ""Wait and Bleed"" their is no such thing as a heaver song on this disk. All of Slipknot's song are very [angry] and loud. I think thats a good thing for a change like other reviers on this page have said, even though some might be turned off by all of the yelling and stuff.Its not like Corey is unable to sing. He proves this in songs like ""Wait and Bleed"". I strongly suggest you pick up the Digipak. It is full of [awesome] Demo's, live songs, and remixs.Its well worth the money and haveing foever if you a metalhead."
5,A must have for any metal fan!!!!,"In my opinion Slipknot is da best metal band out there (2nd place is Mudvayne and 3rd is System of a down) and you HAVE to get this CD...all the songs on the album are sweet, and what could be cooler that 8 total freaks wearing bizzar mask and beating the hell out of each other on stage? if you are a slipknot fan i also recomend geting there video ""there goes the neihborhood"" you will not regret this purchas, these guys are a nice break from all the boy band crap they are playing on tv now a dayz"
3,Slipknot... gimick or buncha psycho's tearing apart music?,"Slipknot is quite an intresting group, to say the least. Their music is good. Hard lyrics, fast beats, hard vocals. However, you just cannot beleive anything they say about themselves. Slipknot is a hard hitting CD, its deffinatly not for the nsync followers (although is would do them good to be forced to listen too it!). Surfacing's chorus, although repatative, is one of the most brutal sets of lyrics (not in a death metal song) that I have heard. Their 9 member band, however, should be better. I have heard better and faster drummers and their guitar use isn't very complex. With 9 guys in the band, you should expect more. I liked the CD, its pretty hardcore, but Slipknot could be better. However, I still highly recommend this CD, and eagerly await Iowa."
2,Another (below) average hardcore band...,"Yeah, some of the songs on this album are good, but not many. Instrumentally, Slipknot is no different than their Korn/Bizkit/Deftones brethren, though their drummer is pretty amazing. But lets be real - most of these songs are pathetic musically. The masks are nothing but a gimmick, and I'm not sure why the heck ANY band, let alone a thrash/metal one, would need nine people. If you are big into the tones or Korn, then this is for you. If not, not."
5,"SLIPKNOT IS THE BEST,A MUST GET!","Slipknot is one of those bands you rarely see,.... lyrics w/ rage,great beats,and cool people. This CD is the best one ive heard since Korn's ""issues""..SLIPKNOT!"
4,Brutal talent wrapped in an awesome tune behind scary masks,"Amazingly, these guys are truly talented. They don't lack skills that they cover up behind their masks. The masks are just another medium for them to express their art. Vocals are imaginative, melodic, and awesome in many senses. Being a large group, they do produce many different sounds from their wide array of instruments. You'll find yourself wanting to get up and move to the stunning, mind-blowing sounds. However, some of their songs are repetitive, but the instruments do play different melodies. All in all, amazing rock with meaning, and a helping of deformity."
3,Disappointing...but not bad.,"I think this Slipknot's weakest album. Overall, this sounds like generic, late 90's nu/rap-metal (think: Limp Bizkit meets Disturbed's first album). The production, lyrics, and musicianship are far weaker than that on Slipknot's latter albums. However, there are some songs worth having, like (Sic), Eyeless, Scissors, Wait and Bleed, and Spit it Out. I would recommend just buying those songs off iTunes, rather than buying the whole CD. As a metal fan, this CD is very heavy and it does rock, and still better than most rock music released in the last 20 years.It's not a bad album, especially for a debut, but don't expect anything nearly as good as ""Iowa"" or ""All Hope Is Gone""."
3,CD-Misrepresentation,"cd cover says parental advisory- Explicit lyrics, but the cd says it is the clean version. What can be done to correct this problem? 1-18-13 I ordered a second copy but it was the same as the first.The producers and distributers need to be notified and they should be able to tell the difference between the clean version and the adult version, if not they should find a way,come on its not rocket science anyone can do it, just ask a few questions or just insist on specific labeling from now on.Thanks."
5,BRUTAL!,"Best thing since Slayer's Reign In Blood album, and it's nothing like KoRn! Every song (except for Tattered and Torn) is totally amsome! I really recomend it to anyone that likes bands like Slayer, KoRn, Tool, Pantera etc."
3,I guess I just grew up or something...,"Don't get me wrong, when I bought this cd back in September, I LOVED it. I couldn't get enough of it. But now after many listens, I find its replay value to be very thin. Most of the songs on here have the same sound, same pattern, same vocals. Think of putting it on the track Eyeless and hitting repeat forever. Although, there are some songs that dare to be interesting, like No Life and the Cut-From-The-Album song, Purity. But overall, I have lost interest. It has nothing to do with Slipknot gaining popularity, or what they said aboutm Korn, etc. I just think I'm a little too mature to be fooled by this act anymore."
5,Certainly one of the best bands around,"I dont see how anyone can compare this to Korn or Limp Bizkit...Slipknot has way more emotion in the lyrics and the musical talent is far superior over Korn or Limp Bizkit. This music is raw and its very aggressive, much better than any other."
5,Nothing is better then the KNOT,"Ok we have all seen the heavy metal bands of this millenium (korn,limpbizkit,Powerman5000,Staind,Taproot,etc...)They are nothing like these Iowans who show what heavy metal music should be like. Slipknot brings Clockwork Orange arrange of matching outfits with Music that makes you wanna break things with a bat. This album is better than any album I have ever listened to. I highly recommend purchasing it, there is nothing like it."
3,"If you own Soulfly and System of a Down, then buy Slipnot","This is a good album, but if you are not going to buy every heavy metal/new metal/death metal album released then go by Soulfly or System of a Down first. Those two albums are more developed than Slipnot and contain the same hard edge that brings you to buy the harder music anyway. I do think this groups next album will be great, definitely a lot of talent."
5,sweet!,"...is the only way i could discribe this. It's a kick a$$ mix of cool guitars, great drum beats and awesome record scraching. It's amazing that Cory (number 8)can go from singing to absoulote screeming so easaly.The music is hard and aggrseive (ideal for after a bad day) but ,unlike other heavy bands i.e. Canable Corpse, has some mealody and is listsonable. The lyrics are good too. This is a must-have C.D. forany fan of heavy music."
3,70% great,"this album starts out with great potential and then starts to drift. the musicians know what they're doing, making some great disorienting music to go perfectly with off kilter lyrics. it hits a snag when the vocalist starts screaming. i'll admit that on tracks like ""wait and bleed"" he has a great voice when he actually sings the refrain instead of screaming it. if you're unsure about this album i say get it, it'll fill that hole in your album where tool didn't."
5,The best Percussion i've ever heard,"Well, Slipknot has a definite unique sound. unlike what the rest of the pantywastes are saying, Corey sounds nothin like Jonathan Davis. And Joey, their drummer, is awesome. If you like double bass, this disc is for you. Joey can hold a 16th note (for all you musicians out there, you know how fast that is) for ten seconds and longer, several times in one song. and their percussionists, Shawn and Chris, can definitley wail. If you hate the world, buy this disc."
1,jeez these guys ...,"Look its icp..... oh nevermind its just another bunch of wanna be hardcore screaming korn kids. This cd makes me wanna cry for the wrong reasons. You hear it and you think things along the lines of ""Do they actually think they're good...... this is joke right?"""
1,Crap,"Lets do the math here folks: 2 crappy guitarists + a mediocre drummer + 2 crappy percussionists + a crappy bassist + plus 2 queers on sampling and turntables + an annoying singer = one of the worst albums ever. ITs not bad enough that they have no talent, but at the same time they have to have no originality, they borrow from past bands but dont add anything to the mix themselves, to add that they bad mouth their forefathers, korn, and act like they're a bunch o tuff guys and how everyone else is posers, but they dont realize they're the biggest posers themselves."
5,A great CD,"again. im seeing people who hate slipknot. those of you who do are stupid. this cd is great. some of these songs arent too good, I know. But lots of the songs are really addicting. and if your one of those ppl who only like this cd just because of Wait and Bleed, then you suck. cuz that song is overplayed and isnt really even that good. the songs worth hearing on this cd is (Sic), Surfacing, Eyeless, Diluted, Spit It Out, Only One, and Me Inside. But i would definitely recommend you try out Vol. 3 first because its much better than this cd anyways."
2,Like listening to heavy metal that was put in a blender,"No solid direction in their music...it goes everywhere....the ""wall of noise"" approach just sucks. I do like a few of their songs though ""Left Behind"" ""Disastorpiece"" ""Vermilion"" and a couple others. I wouldnt buy any of their CDs but I plan to see them live at least once when they come to PDX again"
3,A Little Out Of Hand...,"I have been a Slipknot fan since 2002, and I still listen to them today. However, I wouldn't recommend this album at full price. Some tracks are filler, but classics like ""Wait and Bleed"" and ""Surfacing"" make the disc stand out. A lot of people these days have been giving crap to Slipknot, in which I see no point at all, especially with their matured effort, ""Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses"". If you just like metal in general, I'd pick this up. Otherwise, I'll just purchase a few tracks off iTunes."
1,What a bunch of noisy garbage,"Slipknot is just talentless trash. Everything on this CD is just profane, hate-filled noise. All it is is just endless screaming(except on Wait & Bleed). Slipknot is a disgrace to rock and metal. Go listen to Godsmack. They rule! Slipknot doesn't."
1,"""Real"" Metal !? I don't think so!!!","Since when is rap-rock called metal. I just downloaded this album to see what's so ""cool"" about slipknot and just found a superficial , comercial , boring piece of ""material"" (material!?...yeah,right! more like garbage).I am sad to see that such kind of band is called metal today. If you compare it with the old metallica (1981-'91) you'll see my point.This band is right up there with jessica simpson , britney spears , eminem , n'stync in the MTV hall of fame."
1,Don't waste your money on this!,"This cd is pure crap. Slipknot is not now or will they ever, ever, ever, ever, ever be metal! Don't waste your money on this cd. There are so many real metal bands out there that you could spend your money on. You will hate yourself if you buy this cd."
1,What an Unlistenable Sonic Rant,"I cannot put into words how much I hate this band. I'm sorry, but they are just awful. Yea, my band could be really heavy too if I had like 9 people in it who are all drummers! This is so bad, I just can't understand why everyone likes them so much. It's ridiculous....but that doesn't compensate for the terribleness of this waste of a fine cd. Absolute garbage, stay away from it."
4,"Good music, not-too good lyrics","Slipknot is a good death-metal band, but they aren't exactly metal, more of a mix between metal and rap and alternative and techno. Overall a pretty good CD. Lyrics aren't THAT bad, just a little heavier than most. If you can stand Kid Rock's (even though i really hate him) and Korn's and Limp Bizkit's lyrics, you could handle this (it's all those combined, about). If you are really mad one day, and you want to kill somebody and are just really pissed off, this is the CD to listen to."
4,Almost perfect,"I remember buying this self/titled debut LP from the 'knotters' before many aussies had heard of them. I traveled from place to place trying to find it, eventually settling on an unsetteling price and made my way home with my new purchase....I was totally blown away the first time i listened to it, from the opening grinder (sic) to the closing stages of the secret song (i don't know the name) it kept my ears glued to the stereo. Althought this album kept me listening for a few weeks! i grew tired of them only to be hooked again. If you love bands such as Static-X, Coal Chamber and NOT LIMP BIZKIT, then this is for you."
5,Slipknot - Purveyers of fine nu-metal,"This is the first outing for Slipknot, but it made their name overhight, even gracing the mainstream album charts over here. Some would complain that their somewhat unusual image is their selling point, but no-one can deny the sheer ferocity and passion in their music. This is quite simply up amoung the ranks of Roots or The More Things Change... Expect great things. The album as a whole is not only diverse in its use of tone, atmosphere and riffs, but also the individual songs themselves. As a whole it is a seething mass of guitars, underground beats and aggression."
5,GREAT BUY!,"I heard of slipknot by a friend at school. I thought when I looked at the CD it was going to be a bunch of heroin addics sounding like they were singing in a tin can with dog's barking that were acctually people singing... i was wrong. yes Slipknot is a little hard to understand, but if your like me you don't really care if the lyrics are good. The lyrics are good because i dont care what people think of me, I don't understand why the world is so messed up, and i don't understand why docters tell u it's in ur head if it's more then one person seeing/hearing something.They do have strong lanuage, in the song Spit it out they swear roughly 12 swears a minute. Even though, they are a great band... just because they may look scary don't rule them out... If you like HARD metal get Slipknot... I suggest listening to the samples first to see if you like Slipknot...GO SLIPKNOT, KEEP BRINGING A GOOD NAME TO THE MIDDLE STATES! GO IOWA AND ILLINOIS!"
5,Slipknot`s self-titled CD broke all the standards,"The s__t is wrapped up in a pretty little package called Slipknot. It's the discordant sound of the middle of nowhere, a terrain where Slipknot is jester and king... Slipknot is a metal band that has 9 band members and plays the best music I ever heard.Slipknot rocks this goddamned world!"
4,Goodness Me !,"This album is about as close to the edge as you can get, every song sounds like it is going to be their last. From the menacing intro, followed by the pounding riffs and rhytmns of (sic) you just know that this album is going to get better and better. In fact, it's the album that just keeps on giving, just when you think ""it can't get any heavier can it?"" , it just does. The entire album sounds like a ball of energy, with singer Corey about to explode any minute, so why not stick it in your death-deck and lite the touch paper. I DO NOT reccommend that you buy this album, I COMMAND YOU to purchase it immediately, do not waste any more time, the (sic) world of Slipknot awaits"
5,texasjoehotdog,"Wow! Where do I start? Slipknot is the BEST band there is out there, and always will be. This CD absolutely blows you away. All of there album's are great. They just definetly know how to play. They make Limp Bizkit look like a little sissy, girlie band. I am a total Slipknot fanatic and they are the only band I listen to, except a few others. I listen to them at least 3-4 hours a day. I love all of the songs, but I don't know which is my favorite. It would have to be between Wait and Bleed, No Life, Diluted, or Scissors. Yeah, they might be a little scary looking, but thats one of the things I love about them. How there so crazy and outgoing. The vidoes are so interesting to watch because you never know what they're going to do next. There lyrics are also exciting. They sing about the craziest stuff. Even though I am totally obsessed with all nine guys, I would have to say my favorite is the lead singer, Corey Taylor. I just think he has a great and amazing voice."
1,Slipknot's noise somewhat analogous to explosive diarrhea,"Diarrhea, noun. an intestinal disorder characterized by the abnormal frequency and fluidity of fecal evacuations.Slipknot, noun. a nine-member poser metal band characterized by the production of an abnormal quantity of trite and worthless ""musical"" garbage/psychological waste by-products. This garbage has for its foundation deeply unintelligent lyrics in which four-letter words are indispensable tools for maintaining poetic value and a mindless bludgeoning of the guitars to produce toneless sonic distortions forms the backbone of the music. The heartbeat of the aural turd that is Slipknot is provided by Joey the drummer, whose contributions include rhythmless pounding and yet another rubber mask. Corey the vocalist tops it all off by delivering the aforementioned lyrics with all the emotion and vocal range of a female gorilla in labor. (...)"
1,RIP OFF,These guys are trying to be gwar and failing miserably.If you want guys in costumes get gwar their much better than these guys and they created a back story for it.
1,Destroying our Youth!,I think that mucically the group is talanted but I think they should try to send a more positive message to the young kids of today. So many kids listen to this junk and it twists their minds. Makes kids depressed and suicidal. I know my daughter has not been the same since she has started listening to this junk. She is dark and depressed and becoming a very hateful person. I can only assume that none of the band members have children and if they do I hope they don't have to go thru what I am because of these negative messages thru song!
1,Slipknot is like going to the circus on smack!,"Okay, I know I am going to take a lot of ... for this review because legions of people follow this Des Moines band like mindless zombies willing to do their bidding. I liked Slipknot's idea about the masks the first time around, when it was called Insance Clown Posse. I did like wait and bleed, don't get me wrong or anything. I just have a hard time seeing why seeing a bunch of preppies in masks whinning about ... is so appealing. Bands like this are a dine a dozen, also if anyone has it read the Rolling Stone article they were on the cover of. I mean how arrogant is it to say ""we rule your children, they do what we tell them to"". Right there they wallow in the fact people love them for their total lack of talent. Now you can say this review wasn't helpful if you want, but remember Slipknot follower, the band ... and thats the bottom line."
1,Slipsuck,"This band is pathetic in all ways possible. The only fans they have are a bunch of 13 year old boys. And where is the talent the only thing they do is play one cord and strum on the strings and what kind of band makes lyrics saying f this and f that yeah thats real raw talent.I saw them at tattoo the earth and they were just humiliated by sepultura sevendust and especially slayer who got the whole crowd in an uproar. I remember when there lead singer was like who came out to see slipknot and there was very little crowd response. This is what disgraces American Metal, no talent what so ever, these guy are an embarrassment to the world of music. I you wanna see what real metal is buy mudvayne, pantera, sepultura, slayer, white/rob zombie, and metallica. But stay away from this crap because i still regret the day I bought this, it was just an hour of pure suck."
1,THANK GOD FOR NAPSTER!!,"I tried over and over to like this, but each time as I got into the beat... any potential was destroyed when the vocalist (and I use that term loosely) began his yelling. Try as he might to pull off a Phil Anselmo sound alike, he falls pithetically short of the mark. The tunes could make it otherwise. Basically an aggrevating listening experience. Perfect if you're trying to run off some nieghbors, or get rid of a roomate though. If that is the case CRANK IT UP!! But otherwise save your receipt. Thanks to Napster, I saved myself a trip returning this garbage to the record store!!"
4,get off me,"Ok kids... lets get one thing straight... these guys can play.. sure there are 8 of them, so they should be able to play.. Corey can sing... they grind out the crunchyest of riffs.. and there is the perfect hint of programming in there... Pantera are still the kings of thrashin metal, but slipknot is the new kids on the block..."
2,Slipknot: Excellent Music! Horrible Vocals!,"The eight of them know how to play their instruments and they do it like no other! Two guitarists, a bassist, three drummers and percussionists, a keyboardist, and a DJ/sampler. What could be better? But then the vocalist tries to ruin it all by screaming incoherantly and swearing as much as possible. I give Slipknot 2.5 stars for the great, loud, and heavy music they make(you'll be amased if you see them live). But the vocals are completly terrible."
1,Mindnumbingly Bad,"I not only dislike this CD or the band that produced it for claiming to be extreme metal when they're not, like most like-minded reviewers, but take offense at the idea of crafting songs without solos or any other possible measurement of technical prowess. Drop d tuning and riffs that are composed of the same 3 chords played repeatedly are what make this mallcore garbage truly unpalateable. That, and vocals that are either gangsta rap, whiny and accompanied by teenage angst lyrics, or screamed vocals that are simply worthless when compared to real vocalists, whether they be clean or dirty. All in all, this album, this band, and this genre are the absolute musical pit."
1,"Sorry people, this band is VERY overrated","I would like to say that anyone who likes this band has obviously never listened to fear factory, pantera, spineshank (great up-and-coming band). The singer Corey has a very unimpressive voice. He should take singing lessons from Burton Bell of fear factory. And the rest of the band is for the most part equally mediocre. And they sound horrible live!! That is all i can say, this band kinda disgusts me, reminds me of how mindless and dumb music listeners are nowadays. Unfortunate really...seriously though, if you like this album, buy fear factory's 'demanufacture' the greatest metal industrial masterpiece ever. Or for a avery impressive new band in the vien of this band, try out spineshanks 'strictly deisel' or up-and-coming 'the height of callousness'. and anything by pantera, they are top class!"
5,(SIC) WORTH 5 STARS ALONE,"(SIC) Has to be one of the most punishing songs ever created. It's not as 100% hardcore as some of their other songs, But it's intro's speed and intensity gets you hooked. And what is wrong with ""'someone who knows about music'from 'straight outta compton""? (he's about five or so reviewers down)What an idiot! for God's sake he said ""HEMOGLOBIN""! And if gangster rap is your thing, than why are you going to even bother reviewing a Slipknot album for. Anyways... good tunes. Worth the cash!"
4,A Strong Album,"This album does the trick for me when I'm feeling angry or sad. Although the songs seem to get stale after a while, I will still always count on this album to help me release a variety of negative emotions. Slipknot is definitely a talented band who have no intention of becoming mainstream (which they truly aren't, even to this day, despite the fact a few songs receive airplay on more mainstream stations). I recommend it to those who desire to hear art in which they can form a connection with."
5,Headbanger Music,Slipknot gives metal music a whole new name. Their music kicks ass. This is their best CD they ever made. It has all the great hits too. Anybody who loves metal music should have this CD. Joey has sweet drum beats. Beware there is some bad lauguage.1.742617000027 - 6/102.(sic) - 10/103.Eyeless - 10/104.Wait and Bleed - 10/105.Surfacing - 9/106.Spit It Out - 10/107.Tattered and Torn - 8/108.Me Inside - 9/109.Liberate - 9/1010.Prosthetics - 9/1011.No Life - 9/1012.Diluted - 9/1013.Only One - 9/1014.Scissors - 10/10
4,Great cd,"Great album. Nice and aggressive. Subliminal verses is also great, they really improved their melody on this one, yet still keep all of their heaviness, unlike many bands who attempt to do this. Corey Taylor has a great voice. Shouting, growling, or singing, he's awesome. The singing shows up a lot more in Subliminal verses. All of their cds are great. Great stuff to listen to when your mad at the world or having a bad day. Just hard brutal alternative metal."
2,I own a different version of this same CD,"I have the same version of this CD, except it is in a DIGI-pack case, had the videos for Wait and Bleed and Spit it Out, the demos for Get This, Interloper, and Despise, and it came from Englan, not Japan. And it only cost me 52 bux in stores. If you ask me, you are better off going into stores to get it."
5,"Liked this one better than Iowa, I think...","This is the best and my favourite Slipknot cd. I liked almost every song on the cd, some examples (sic), Diluted, wait And Bleed, Surfacing, and Spit It Out. For any metal fans, Slipknots the $h!t. Highly, highly, highly recommend this one. You wont be disappointed."
2,Obviously a freshman effort,"Slipknot breaks out of the box running, with tracks 2-6 being flat out awesome. Then they break a couple legs. Nothing else on the album compares to the first 5 songs. Nothing."
5,"""eyeless""","Ok, every true slipknot fan out there knows that this album is not their debut! I just wanted to make that clear for all the new faces that are finding out about slipknot andwant to pretend they know this band and say ""what an awsome debut"" making them look like they knew slipknot since the start!Any-ways,i remenber when slipknot's selftitle album their second album first came on stores and how it made alot of people that loves a difirent type of nu-metal very happy.Slipknot still a great band and their third album ""iowa"" sounds very good but it doesn't have the great sound as their debut or their selftitle one!Over-all ? great album and the best songs here are ""eyeless"" , ""sic"" , ""surfacing"" , and, ""spit it out"" i mean slipknot is the only type of nu-metal that should be apreciated! laters!!"
5,AMAZING!!!,"INCREDIBLE!!! The first time I heard this album I was amazed and excited!!! It has great in your face drumming, OUTSTANDING vocals and the guitar riffs are original and not just ripped off some other band. Now, I have this CD, the Digipak version, and the rare original featuring Purity and Frail Limb Nursery. I think anyone who appreciates uniqueness should go out and buy this album imediatley!"
4,NEW METAL/ROCK/ALT./DEATH/THRASH with a little rap.(notmuch),"Slipknot is a strange crossbreed of metal new and old. I obviously pegged it for a Korn-alike right away. But after listening to the whole cd the comparisons drifted apart. The confusion of a new sound disorientates the listener the first few times around. I saw origins of Slayer, Sepultura, Pantera, and of course the ever present Korn. They have a distinct new sound that actually sounds better the more I listen to it. I give this cd a high replay value which is hard to find among the sea of BS today. I would definantly buy Slipknots second cd if it were to appear. Track #11 ""PROSTHETICS"" is a good adrenaline rush from hell."
5,These guys are from my state!,"I saw these guys at a festival about a year before they hit it big, & they were great. I couldn't believe a band this good weren't famous yet. The next thing I know, it's a year later, & I see their major label debut in a local record shop. It just goes to show that not all of us in Iowa are a bunch of hicks!"
4,"Unique, Hard, and emotionaly beautiful","This cd is very hard and raw. It combines the most brutal music in america to this point and takes it to another level.But unlike talentless repedative bands like metalica and megadeth, Slipknot actualy have something to say. Even with their hard sound they keep lyrics that are very in-depth and emotional. No other band has been able to blend poetry, emotion and a hard unique sound into one cd as slipknot have.I would give this five stars, but the only thing I did not like was the Purity wasn't included here. Not to say I dont love the rest of the cd, but that song would have made it even better."
2,I used to somewhat like this band....,"but it just gets kind of old, this album has a few gems, and the rest is just screaming and pure noise. the best songs are the ones where there is actual singing in it, it provides a good mix and a change of pace.""Wait and Bleed"" is by far the best song on the album and i never seem to get tired of it. ""Surfacing"" is also pretty good along with ""Spit it out"" and ""Me inside""(Although a little too short.The rest of the album is just a bunch of incomprehensible screaming, deafening guitars, a couple of clowns(literally) hitting trash cans and a drummer thats so good he really seems out of his element."
4,Ouch - I hurt myself listening to this,"Slipknot's debut album is about as subtle as a kick to the groin. The unabashed aggression is led by too-pissed-off-to-be-healthy singing and thrash guitar, and backed by three (!) percussionists, a DJ and one badass bass-player. This is mosh-pit music at it's finest - a constant groove punctuated by surprisingly hooky choruses and sing-along refrains. And while the over-the-top percussion might clutter the mix every now and again, the sonic texture that it creates helps to keep the band from being too Korny or Limp. Slipknot's niche lies in its naked sonic violence and solid, genre-busting songwriting."
2,slipknot,Theyre ok. But I do admit that they have no talent. I just like listening them when Im bored of good stuff and need some mindless crap.
1,Stay Away From Slipknot!,"How do ""bands"" like Slipknot get signed anyway? No Talent what so ever! However, I won't say that Slipknot are Korn Klones. With Korn, you can actually hear some emotion in the music, lyrics, and singing. With the exception of Metallica (old and new), RATM, NIN, Ozzy/Sabbath, & Type O-, I barely listen to metal. Slipknot make me thankful for that!"
1,"If this is music, then I'm Mozart","Oh boy. Yet another band full of angry people (or at least people acting very angry because it's ""cool"" to have a negative attitude), with a lead singer that screams obscenities instead of sings, instrumental parts that more resemble the sounds of construction work than music, the obligatory scary picture and parental advisory sticker on the front, and an overbearingly bleak and extremely pessimistic worldview.I play piano, drums and guitar, and don't think I'm all that great, but I feel like my musical skills are pretty darn good when I listen to utter rubbish like this. And in the space of 30 years, we've gone from ""And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make"" to...whatever this is. I'm guessing these guys are seriously PO'd about something. Yep...rich and PO'd. Seems to be the norm these days. Sorry, I just can't share the mad-at-everything outlook of these sorts of bands."
1,I am very let down...,"Gee, I remember getting this CD before it was even released..my friend works in a record store and got the promo copy for a friend of mine...we loved it, and they were one of my favorite bands. I first heard of Slipknot way back in April of '99 when I got their demo tape at a concert..no one had heard of them, and I liked it like that. But the point of all this is--Slipknot sold out...big time. Now I am not like the other people that think a band has sold out because they are on the radio or MTV, which is fine, but if they change their music so they are played on MTV or the radio, then I consider that selling out. My case in point...""Wait and Bleed"". I heard it on the radio with the second verse completly changed..no longer does Corey scream, but he sings normally...Slipknot, I am very letdown.."
1,This is mind blowingly terrible,"Don't get me wrong. It's not that i don't like hardcore bands or music that is made with passion, but it's just that.this band is continually supported by people claiming that it is poetic and passionately expressive, but in actuality it is just 9 people getting together and making a lot of noise while someon screams about how everyone hates them and how terrible people in the world today are. This id the kin=d of thing that i find disgusting and am shocked that people actually buy it.I would encourage you to buy a cd by The Mars Volta or by At the Drive in if you want to hear actually strongly passionate music and something by opeth if you want to hear actually good heavy music.this band is just the worst in the history of the world"
1,a 9 piece with the creativy of none,9 people and this product? These morons are just trying to look bad and have no taste in music. you can't just scream and write dumb riffs ripped off slayer and call it breakthrough music. I came on this cd and threw it off the window. You should do the same and listen to 'Reign in Blood' by slayer written in 1986 and shreds this to pieces. PIECE BY PIECE.
1,no stars,"This Aint music, this is just s#~t, infact its a pile of s#~t, why waste ya money on some masked nuggets screaming down the mic.go out and get some 2pac or bone thugs n harmony albums, thats real music"
1,[Bad],"I used to think these guys were alright. This is no longer the case, I'm afraid.Pass this one up and get yourself some Cryptopsy."
1,Moron : Imbecile : : Diarrhea : Slipknot,"Diarrhea, noun. An intestinal disorder characterized by the abnormal fluidity and frequency of fecal evacuations.Slipknot, noun.

This creative equivalent of a bowel movement has for its foundation deeply unintelligent lyrics in which four-letter words are indispensable tools for maintaining poetic value and a mindless bludgeoning of the guitars to produce toneless sonic distortions forms the backbone of the ""music."" The heartbeat of the aural turd that is Slipknot is provided by Joey the Drummer, whose contributions include rhythm less pounding and yet another rubber mask. Corey the Vocalist tops it all off by delivering the aforementioned lyrics with all the emotion and vocal range of a female baboon in labor."
2,"Oh Slipknot, Slipknot.....","First, let me say that I have mucho conflicted feelings about this band. My sister loves them, so I feel bad trashing them, and yet I do it so often. My problem with them is that when I listen to them I don't hear much. I look at their lyrics and I don't see much. The writing is juvenile at best, and all of those guys just create a wall of sound, and not a good one. The masks and such seem like a contrived marketing ploy, and I hate when a band does that. Oh, and don't think I can't take such ""heavy"" metal. My favorite band is Emperor, so there. I like my metal intelligent and real, and Slipknot comes across as neither of these things."
4,Feel the love...,"Slipknot is a band to be reckoned with. Their debut album is a perfect example of how insane these guys really are. They have one of the heaviest, most incredible forms of metal around today in their music. And it's just so awesome you feel the need to start headbanging to it, or maybe go out and break something. I urge you not to miss out on this."
4,Fun,"OK, if you want a serious musical record that is the height of human achievement, go get something by Sigur Ros, Radiohead, Pink Floyd, or any of the other bands I rave about in my reviews. If you want a serious metal album, Opeth, In Flames, and The Dillinger Escape Plan are good bets.This is something that can (and should) not be taken seriously. However, it is one HELL of a fun album to blast while hanging out with friends or play in the middle of the night when your physics paper is due the next day. This is not the Greatest Musical Recording In History... just a bunch of guys banging on their instruments and screaming hillariously demented and obscene lyrics. (for example: ""You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyyeeeeeessssss!""). Funny thing is, the main drummer and the lead guitarist are actually quite good.Bottom line: if you want a good time, buy this CD used."
5,Classic Album,"I remember when this album first came out I was in high school and, to me at the time, this was some very hard hitting original stuff. I bought the album twice at the time because I lost one and the tracks on those I purchased were different than the ones listed here. This is because once Slipknot hit radio waves they re-arranged the album. I have no idea where you would still find the original today, it's probably worth a good chunk of change.Nevertheless this is still a masterpiece. Some metalheads might hate on this album but they have no reason to. If it never saw mainstream then they would love it as well."
3,whenever I enjoyed Slipknot (3.5),"This album has more diversity of Slipknot. Some songs bring a hard punk edge to them (i.e. ""Wait and Bleed""), have cool sounds (i.e. [sic]), and not excessive volume-11 sounds. It also shows them a hip-hop side, but in a good way. Corey's voice shows that they're still rock, but I like their groovability in each song. The drumming isn't really high-quality, but I like the sounds of everything else on this album. If you want to buy ANYTHING by Slipknot, stop by with this one. Corey even sings on this one sometimes, which the first two singles show. Shows all their influenced sounds. Hopefully, they decide to go back to this sound. If they do, I'll like them much better. If they use the Iowa sound, I hope they're forgotten soon enough. But this one's the enjoyable one."
5,THERE BEST CD,"they may not be the hardest bands out there but there great.there one of the best nu-metal bands out there.there sound is great.they are talented and the singer can sing.the best songs are spit it out,sic,eyeless,and surfacing."
5,It's awesome,this is a great cd. it is their best yet. the madness is just great. you cant go wrong with this cd.
5,Aw NOW we're talkin...,This album is one of if not the angriest and aggressive metal albums ever but it's not the typical song-with-no-direction-just-play-as-fast-as-you-can-and-scream-like-you're-being-cornholed-by-a-can-of-juicy juice crap. THIS IS REAL METAL ! THEIR NEW STUFF AND NEWER METAL DOES NOT COMPARE IN ANY WAY ! Raw..angry..fast..real.....and sorely missed.....
5,"Slopknot, what else do you need to say","I think this was the best of the first 3 albums. If you into this type of music, get it. If you not into this type of music, get it and you soon will be."
2,Compared to stone sour....,This is a decent album for nu-metal but compared to stone sour it's a masterwork.
5,"I hits, and it hits you hard!","I bet this hits you hard if you like hard music! Lyrics are awesome! You can find facts, fictions and stories about real-life from it...you can't see california without Marlon Brando's eyes... You can hear how the 9 members fits in a band like this; what would Slipknot be without 2 percussionists and a turntable? SlipKnot isn't like any other band and it's really not like KoRn, no. It's more like...Strapping Young Lad; Fast, hard, and (little bit)melodic. Excellent record! Listen, buy and listen more!"
5,awesome,"this has to be one of the best cd's i have ever bought. ever song is in your face heavy and cory's vocals send a chill down your spine the first time you hear them. for all you people who think that slipknot is a korn rip-off (granted korn did pave the way for them; plus i love korn, too), slipknot is way ahead of korn rhythmically, musically, and the know how to put on a better show and make the songs real."
2,Metal for the mindless,"If you like hardcore metal that doesn't require a lot of thought to listen to, bands who have to wear costumes to make up for a lack of talent, and lyricists who have to constantly swear because they can't put an intelligent sentence together... then you'll love this album. Join the herd... go and buy it!"
3,Goofy,"After hearing lead singer Corey on love line, I expected big things from slipknot. This guy came off as very intelligent and very pissed off. Well, one part of that was right. This is music created by a few talented muscicians who have a lot to say but absolutely NO idea how to say it. The music is wonderfully hard. I could go without the turntables but I can manage listening to them. The lyrics are another story. These lyrics sound like something an angry fourth grader would write. They are terrible. Their only virtue is that they go well with the music. However, they say NOTHING and do not hold my interest for long. Anger and agression are good if used properly, on this album it unfortunately isn't. If the members of Slipknot are reading, keep up the good music but find what you want to say and then say it well."
2,SOME GOOD SONGS....,"SLIPKNOT as a live band is a little interesting...the band menbers with those ugly masks, and the roars and screams, and the band headband their heads all the time...the songs are absolutelly brutal, with absurd sick lyrics...i like to see a live performance by Slipknot once in a while, but listen to this repetitive NU METAL with no solos or any variation through the songs is hard...if you like TOTAL BRUTAL GUTURAL NU METAL, you may actually like Slipknot, but as i said, is almost impossible to listen to the whole album because it's all too dark and similar...and i like HEAVY music, like PANTERA, SEPULTURA, TESTAMENT, LAMB OF GOD, MASTODON and SLAYER...but Slipknot is not so good...try those bands i said i like...they are WAY WAY WAY WAY better than slipknot...."
5,slipknot,When I first heard wait and bleed on the radio I was blown away. Finnaly a good hard rock song I can enjoy listening to. I was determined to buy the c.d. When I finnaly bought it I was stuned. I've never in my life heard a better c.d. It has great tunes and beats. Its not like other boring c.d's. I recomend it to everyone.
3,Could've been better,"Needed more edge and death to the music. It sounds so monotonous. If you've listended to the versitality of KoRn, Limp Bizkit, Static X etc before, you'll find the album a big disappointment. Interesting in the begin, boring in the end. But none the less, if you like quick metal, with alot of mumbling and you're rich, buy the album. But I recommend Mission Impossible:2 OST since it got some REAL hard rock without unneccesary swearing (includes fantastic songs by Metallica, Limp Bizkit, Rob Zombie, etc)."
5,I LOVE SLIPKNOT!,"Slipnot has to be my most favorite band in the whole wide world. The lyrics are cool, the concerts are cool, and the masks are cool. Jim and Mick really know how to play the guitar. Sid is by far the BEST DJ I've ever heard. Joey, Chris, and Shawn are the best drummers. Paul is a great bassist. Craig is the best sampler. And Cory, my favorite member of the band, does the best vocals I have ever heard. He can go from screaming to singing to whispering to screaming again and still make the music sound good. I HIGHLY recommend Slipknot to anyone."
5,this cd is the evolution in metal music,"This is one of the best metal albums I ever heard, its like the Nevermind(Nirvana) of metal. when I play it, I just go crazy bounce up and down in my room, (Sic) and Liberate makes me go nuts, Eyeore is cool to, is like the punker song of slipknot, i've seen them live once and they f...en rule!"
4,very cool,"although what they are doing has been done a thousand times slipknot pulls the hardcore sound off nicely.although sounding like jonathan davis from Korn at times the singer has some originality to his voice,this album would be perfect with a little more harmonization on the vocal parts.but all around i think its good and worth buying, but if its hardcore with a vocalist that can harmonize and scream that you're into, better try some Ultraspank or Nothingface."
3,"Decent music, but unoriginal vocals","Slipknot have great ideas musically, don't get me wrong. The riffing is great and more original than most newer bands out there. Then . . . the vocals start. . . . and then the band just turns into a sped-up Korn knockoff. Corey Taylor has Jon Davis' screams and whines down verbatim and it just really takes away from the music. My advice to them would be to lose the Korn imitation and try singing, because musically, this band could do great things."
4,Amazing!!!,I saw Slipknot at OzzFest yesterdat and they are so Amazing!!!!!! There on stage performance is just as good as there music. Slipknot makes you want to get up and knock over the person next to you. You gotta get this CD.
1,What on earth where they thinking?,Sorry but this isn't what I looking for from this band. I heard My Plague and thought it wasn't too bad until I heard Wait and Bleed. They are just weirdos in masks headbanging and shouting till they get sore throats and start choking. A complete waste of time.
2,Try Slipknot's most recent...,"Heard ""Duality"" on the radio, got interested in Slipknot, heard ""Wait and Bleed"", and decided to buy this CD. Well, its not a complete dissapointment, and is certainly interesting, but, to be blunt, a toddler with a pot and pan set has more flow than this. Incorporating repetitive gutiar riffs, annoying turntables, thrashing drumming, a virtually unhearable bass, and then rap-metal screaming on top of it all, Slipknot's self-titled album is almost unlistenable. Would be completely unlistenable if it weren't for songs like ""Wait and Bleed"", and moments on ""Me Inside"" and ""No Life"". But I can't stand rap-metal unless its REALLY good, and I havn't found any good rap-metal yet...Bottom Line: Angry, unorganized, and talentless sounding (But its easy to see that they ARE talented by listening to their most recent, ""Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses"" and ""Stone Sour"", which are highly recommended)"
2,EHHH....,"I used to like this band, but after getting a reality check new bands like Shadows Fall and Lamb of God, they are just a bunch of posers. Honestly there's 9 members and 2 percussionists playing trash cans and they suck at it! Most of the guitars sound just like Korn(who i also dispise). The only talented mebers are corey and joey. If you want good nu metal, check out Nothingface and Kittie. Slipknot is just a kid's clothing line."
1,The missing link,"Well, after seeing these guys I know what humans have evolved from. This is just bad music. Ok. It's not music. It's sound. I could make this album in an afternoon. Chances are you could too. Their is no sense of melody or musical structure, it's just ""hey should I hit my head off my drum kit here?"" , ""do it man, we're all so mad!""Music is a form of art and I respect that. But art has to be creative, this just isn't. Masks? Ripoffs. Try Mr. Bungle about a decade ago. There's some truly crazy music that IS a form of art.This shouldn't appeal to anyone who has evolved."
3,Half decent debut,"I got this for Christmas of 99 from a friend of mine who said I would dig them, and what I got was a mixed bag. I can't say I'm really a fan, but then again I can't say I really hate them all that bad, I just think they're pretty much unoriginal. To me Slipknot falls under the same category as Korn, Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, and all the recent trend-metal. No matter how hardcore kids may think they are, its been done before, and been done better, don't believe me?, check out early footage of Slayer or Morbid Angel playing live and you'll see what I mean. Lead vocalist Corey Taylor draws inspiration from Slayer, Metallica, and Mercyful Fate, which sometimes you can hear, but there is a lack of melody on a lot of the songs which doesn't give it much replay value. They have talent and they have the drive to become big metal heroes and just not teeniebopper metal puppets, but what will happen remains to be seen."
3,Wait and Bleed is a phenomenal song...The rest...Okay!,"I first heard Wait and Bleed on the Scream 3 soundtrack, and loved it. I thought it was an excellent song, and I was eager to hear more from this band. I got the CD, and listened to it. How disappointing! I mean it does deserve its 3 stars that I gave it, but really. The only thing the singer does is SCREAM! That kinda stuff is ok, but that is not talent. Not by any stretch of the imagination. I would really like to hear more songs like Wait and Bleed. Phenomenal song....."
4,MUCH BETTER THAN IOWA.............................,"It took me a while to get used to this kind of heavy music (I used to listen to Country music a lot) but this is, by far, one of the best damn Heavy Metal albums I have ever heard. I've reviewed Slipknot's latest album,IOWA, and gave it 3 stars. I give this CD 4 stars because it's a lot better than IOWA. Songs like ""Spit It Out"" and ""Surfacing"" are just incredible! If you like Heavy Metal then get this album! YOU SHOULD LOVE IT A LOT!"
2,Slipknot....,"The only songs that I enjoyed were sic, eyeless, and wait and bleed. The lead singer has a nice voice, however, I just didn't like the cd very much. This is just something some angry, hopeless, teenager who feels like the whole world is against him would like. If you are an angry, hopeless teenager, then this may be a great cd for you. but for me...It's just not something im interesting in. I want something more creative and inspiring...i guess... Anyways...I would like to say eyeless is an awesome song and it just made me go like ""wow!"" so I gave 2 stars for the first 3 songs after that the cd is just like "" ughghgh"" If you wanna hear slipknot, get iowa, that is a decent cd."
5,"complicated, yet simple","i must tell you a couple of things...listen to a slipknot song before you buy this album. get a friend or someone at a local cd shop to play a song for you (the ""non-franchise"" places will still do it if you ask). while you're listening to the song, look in the book at the lyrics. i'll admit, they are difficult to understand at first, but you catch on quick if you know what they are saying. also, look at the cover. if the cover 1)scares you or 2)makes you roll your eyes, do not buy this album. you weren't MEANT to get it. slipknot has no pretenses and comes right at you. the songs are well produced but don't have the feel of being over-tweeked. this album is unbelievable, fast-paced inspired rage. after many, many listens, i still come back to it."
1,Im not writing a bad review,"Ok im not going to write a bad review on slip, though I cant stand them but thats not the point. Just to let you know one thing, dear people slipknot is not metal they will never be metal, why you ask? Because slip doesnt have lead solos and why they dont is because their guitarists arent very good and cant play them, all they can play are power chords, which means just noisy guitar. However they have a good drummer but he belongs in a real metal band like danzig or something. Oh and when you rap that has nothing to do with metal, but hey enjoy the album its fine if you like slipknot but just dont consider them metal just because MTV and the radio says they are, because they arent,its just rap&rock; mix, nothing more and nothing less. It misses everything metal has to offer, know that just because something is heavy doesnt just make it metal...."
3,"Hoping for more songs similar to ""100 years"" & ""Superman""","--I've been waiting months for this album to be released after hearing ""100 years"" on the radio. I loved their previous hit, ""Superman"", and am equally impressed with ""100 years.""This is my first purchase of a Five for Fighting album, and I probably had unreasonable expectations. Don't get me wrong, ""100 years"" isn't the only decent song on the album. There are about 3-4 other tracks that are worth listening to -which is no different from most CD's that the recording industry releases these days. Usually your lucky if there is more than one song that you like.The only reason that this album gets three stars, is because I like ""100 years"" so much...The rest of the songs, I could care less for.I wish I would have gone with my first instinct and bought the ""100 years"" single from one of the music download sites. That way, I wouldn't have had to buy 11 songs that I don't like, just for one that I do."
1,Battle for everything,"Arrived on time, but had a CD of Gomer Pile music in it instead of this CD. Not too happy."
1,Wake me when it's over,"I love this band, but this cd is borderline just bad. I am so disappointed. It's very boring and bland. I'm just not sure what they were thinking with this cd. They had all kinds of momentum going into this cd. I'm sure they were given more resources than they have ever had at their disposal, and all they could come up with is a mediocre cd that honestly doesn't have one good song on it. When they tried to kick it up with Angels and Girlfriends, they blew it, so even the potentially fun song on the cd is just bad. Awful cd. If you want to waste your money to see if I speak the truth, feel free; it's your money. I wish I hadn't."
3,Your Ears Will Warm Up,"Initially, I listened to this album a few times and then put it away. It was very unlike 'American Town' More mellow and not as interesting lyrics, particularly 'Disneyland.' Then recently I pulled it back out and it has grown on me slowly. I still don't know if 'Disneyland' is supposed to be a satire like the song 'Michael Jordon' on their previous album, but it doesn't quite come across that way. So over all I enjoy the Battle for Everything, but not as much as 'American Town.'"
4,a new convert,"What a great CD. Melodic, terrific songwriting and sounds a cut above most everything else out there. '100 Years', 'Dying', 'Nobody, and 'One More for Love' are particular favorites, but there isn't a weak cut. The kind of album that just grows on you with each listen and guarantees you hear something different each time. BUY IT!"
4,Great CD!,"This is my first FFF purchase, but it won't be the last. Will definitely purchase the first CD after listening to the battle for everything."
4,Five Rocks,It has a lot of emotion and heart felt lyrics. I love the song a 100 years. The rest of the CD does not disappoint.
3,It's OK,"This album is not as good as the previous one. It lacks in everything the previous one represents. I saw the music video for 100 Years so I decided to get the album. 100 Years is a good song, but many of the other tracks just plain lack. It is an OK album, but get their other albums before you get this 'un."
2,Disappointing,"With songs like ""100 Years"" and ""Superman"", I anticipated that this album would be top notch and a masterpiece lyrically. However, the truth is ""100 Years"" is the only song worth mention on this album. It was very disappointing to not hear this artist reach his potential."
2,Below Average,"If you are a true five for fighting fan and have listened to all of their CDS, not just America Town, you will realize that John is losing his 'edge'. This CD is filled with more sappy slow songs than I could've ever imagined. Not saying that's always a bad thing, and I know artists evolve through the years, but I just wish some of the fire was left in Five For Fighting."
2,Definitely NOT his best work,"This was by far my least favorite of all the Five for Fighting albums I've purchased. There's a tone I didn't exactly expect from John Ondrasik, and most of the songs have a rather menacingly dark and sullen feel to them. The song ""100 years"" is about the only even marginally optimistic portion of this CD.I'm not saying it's totally horrible music, just that it's not the happy, worthwhile music I'm used to from Five for Fighting. If you're into this style of music, you may like it more than I did. Otherwise, just be aware that this album is definitely a little different."
5,The Battle for Everything Five for Fighting,Excellent. Sounds are good. The best cd he made. Worth the money.
4,Another winner from Five for Fighting,"""100 Years"", the first single from the new CD, proves that the success FFF had with ""superman"" was more than just a one time thing. This impactful song stays with you and makes you really think about the lyrics. It is just a preview into a CD full of great songwriting and music. FFF has definitely delivered."
2,Its still not alright if you wake up in Disneyland!!!!!,"This cd was a real big let down! The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because of the 100 years song! I waited and waited for the cd to come out. When the cd came out I rushed to the store to buy it on sale for $7.88; I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it! Its not worth it. The guy does not know how to write songs! The songs Nobody and Disneyland are drop dead hilarious!!! You don't have to take my review seriously but the rest of the cd is NOTHING like ""a 100 years""."
4,More great songwriting from Ondrasik.,"Lots of good songs on here, deep hooks, great writing, you can hear the inspiration of 70's era Elton John pretty heavy, but Five For Fightning retain their uniquess though Ondrasik's signature paino and vocal style while exploring new ground."
4,Not bad,"I love the song 100 years, it is very deep and profound. Rest of the album has a sweet sound as well!"
5,Five for Fighting-The Battle for Everything,I love this CD! I am 55 yrs old and have heard a lot of music; but I can safety say this music is in my top 5.
5,Best in a while,"Five for Fighting just keeps getting better! John Ondrasik writes his own songs, which is quite obvious by the way he sings them--from the heart! My favorite song in this album is number 9, Maybe I. He has the uncanny ability to make you feel like crying in some songs and dancing in others and keeps a great balance of the two."
5,Love this CD!,"I would have to say that this cd is, in my mind, is as great as their first CD. The songs seemed to speak to me. I love ""100 Years"" as well as many others, including ""Maybe I"" and ""Dying"". It's a must have for any Five for Fighting fan!!"
5,Life's Battles ...,"Five For Fightings ""A Battle for Everything,"" is one of the best albums of our time. It has a song for every mood possible in your life. It is inspiring and relaxing .. A Battle for Everything will knock you off your feet and pick you back up again!"
2,Uneven & Reckless,"I'm all for an album having something for everyone...different flavors for differant moods. But this is just frustrating. On the strength of the two singles (over the past two CDs) and a Mark & Brian interview, this CD seemed like a no-brainer. Regrettably, the CD is a profound disappointment. While he's clearly a skilled vocalist (see: 100 Years), the balance of the album is loaded with gritty and lazy vocals--like we were trying for a ""live"" unpolished sound. Swing and a miss!Bottom line: if you appreciate the pop sensibility of his hits, if you're looking for more of the same, you'll come up emtpy handed"
5,Broken trees and elephant ivory........,"I too, bought this CD because I was quietly effected by the serene and thoughtful song, 100 Years.....I love piano..... This kid has a beautiful stoke on the keys and his timing is superb. I read that he had entertained the idea of becoming an opera singer at one time, so that explains the high notes... I love the high notes..... I think this CD expresses a lot of joy and understanding of our self-purpose along with a few of those experiences which will forever keep us in the dark. If you want crazy, smashing guitar kind of rock, I would not suggest this CD. If you want beautiful melodies, lyrics and a sense of complete retreat, this may be for you. My favorite song is ""Maybe I"" although I listen to the entire CD all the time and relish every song. It really is a masterpiece in its own right. This is the kind of group you will keep an eye on and run gladly to the store to buy their next chapter....."
4,The Battle for the next great CD,"As a follow up the his self titled album, which was amazing from start to finish, the battle for everything goes a different way. As we all know the first single ""100 years"" is amazing and doing very well on the radio. This whole CD will take you on an adventure the first song NYC weather report is awesome & it just gets better as the cd goes on, angels & girlfriends, disney land, it's a different sound from the first cd but equally as awakening to the ear. It's a must buy for old & new fans alike!"
5,Fiverocks!,"""The Battle for Everything"" is one of the best albums that has come out in the last year. John Ondrasik once again pours his heart and soul into his music. Lyrically, he is very creative, musically he is amazing. This album is even better than ""America Town"". I can't wait to see this leg of the new tour."
5,Nothing comes close,"This is my favorite game of all time. It is fun to hang out in the shadows and stuff. It takes time to get used to the game if you are a first person shooter type of guy(or girl) this game is believeable unlike DOOM or something. Yeah, the co-op is on the short side but it is well worth playin with one of your buddies!"
2,Mediocre Version,"I own the X-box version of this game and it is incredible. I rented the play station one just for fun. I knew it wouldn't come close, but I just wanted to see how it stacked up. This game is of very mediocre quality by to days standards. The first splinter cell that came out for PS2 is better than this one. The PS2 Chaos Theory sort of looks like an early prototype of the X-Box version before detail, texture, high quality graphics and nonlinear mapping were put in. If you don't have the X-box though, it's still a pretty fun game, so I'd recommend at least renting it."
4,SPLINTER CELL 3 IS A SWEET GAME.,"I have to say Splinter Cell:Chaos Theory(aka Splinter Cell 3,SC3 and SC:CT) is a great game-MUCH better than the suck Pandora Tommorow and original-This is the only Splinter Cell game i actually like.There is a better story and more freedom in the game,you can perform one of the most stealthiest of Military moves-the ""Inverted Neckbreak"" and you now have a combat knife,guards are smarter,there is not as much ""trial and error"" as the previous two games,this is definatly a ""step forwards"" for Splinter Cell series,hopefully ""Double Agent"" will improve on what Chaos Theory has done.I rate this game(PS2 version) 8.1/10!I admit ""Metal Gear Solid 3:Snake Eater"" was a much better game but SC3 was still great in its own merits-I doubt Splinter Cell will ever overtake Metal Gear,But the games will get more fun and better.Bye."
5,Excellent,Yet another excellent Splinter Cell game that is as good as the first and a lot better than the second. Can't wait to buy number 4 !!!
2,Did a former DJ own this?,"Running the risk of sounding really angry, I begin this review. Actually I have very little problem with Ubisoft's actual game, it's the physical copy I have issue with. Not even remotely playable. I mean, did the last owner use it to clear thorn bushes or something? Because that's what it looked like.So, in short, great game. Unplayable disc."
3,Far too easy...much easier than the previous games.,"I have played all of the games of this series, and the previous two were much harder to beat than this one.This one seems to focus more on attack than stealth. Fisher can make a LOT of noise before people notice...and even when they do, a headshot makes quick work of them.The AI is stupid. I can whistle or make some sort of sound, and all of the baddies on the map will come to my location, where I can gun them all down. Area clear. yawn.It's not a total loss, and the story is fun and interesting. For the price it is now, I would buy it (and I did). But I feel sorry for the people who paid full price."
4,Good for the money,The unit is worth every dime. There is only one thing to watch for. The line 6 spider 3 amp has presets that are not compatable with this effect. In order to use it with that amp you will have to change the clean channel to no effects and turn everything else down to zero. Just leave the channel volume up or plug the floor pod into the small mp3 imput jack. Once that is done you are golden.
5,I love this device!,"I finally received my Line 6 FloorPOD plus, and i love it!... it's very good and give me amazing sound. The delays are very good, similar to the line6 independent delay pedals. It's a low price article, i highly recommend it."
5,line 6 pedals,i'm verry impressed and pleased with line 6 products.The PODplus pedals are everything i wanted and more. It has alot of awesome effects.
2,Too Concise,"I was very disappointed to find out that the number of entries in this reference book is so shamefully small. The problem with this book is therefore not its contents, but rather its failure to present the multitude of contemporary British slang. Actually, I've felt deceived."
2,too concise,"I was very disappointed to find out that the number of entries in this dictionary is shamefully small. Therefore, the problem with the book is not its contents, but rather the multitude of contemporary British slang that is not included. I am sorry to say that I've felt deceived."
1,Greed,"There are so many Lou Reed collections that are better than this one. The original Walk on the Wild Side: The best of Lou Reed has all the songs that this one has, plus a few more, and much cooler album art. With only six extremely common songs, one can only imagine why a record would release this waste-of-time compilation."
5,Very Thrilling.,"This book is equal to that of the Setite and Tzimicie. Not only is the plot great, but the book is very thrilling and does not lose its edge at any point. It also shows how Losambra really work, and you thought the Ventrues were royal. The book stands on its own even if you didn't read the previous books of the series. I highly recommend it."
2,So So,"That is the opinion of my Mother in Law, whom I bought it for. I suppose someone who could still dance may enjoy it more."
4,nice artwork,"cool book to own if you're a fan of classic sci fi movies, all the posters are now full page, my only gripe is that some of the posters were scanned from folded posters and you can see the creases, surely they could've gotten better posters especially for some of the not as old movies like Star Wars & ET, or they could've at least edited out the creases in Photoshop"
4,A Nice Edition of the 1928 BCP,"This is a nice edition of the 1928 Book of Common Prayer. I decided to buy this copy when I realized that the personal edition with imitation leather cover that I bought many years ago really was not suitable for study purposes. (I prefer hardcover books.) This is a ""pew edition"". The size of the book is good for general reading, and the binding seems sturdy. The burgundy cloth cover gives the book a rich appearance. However, in place of the usual certification, there is only a disclaimer stating that this edition was photoreproduced from a certified book; hence the type is not very crisp, and the pages have a ""photocopied"" look to them. But that's okay. I really like this book.Please note that this edition does not come with the gift box illustrated with the catalog entry. The cover has a gold Latin Cross, and the title is on the spine.Please note, I am not an Episcopalian, only a student of liturgy."
3,Kindle edition needs original page numbers,"Great that the 1928 BCP is available in Kindle format but it needs the original page numbers and the ability to go to same. In practical se we go to page 67 of the BCP, etc. If I missed this feature/function please let me know."
4,1928 Book of Common Prayer,"A good, reasonably priced, no frills publication. Comes with two ribbons. I would prefer three. Has what I need for Anglican services."
4,"thoughtful, beautiful set of songs","Excellent instrumentation,wonderful vocals, meaningful storytelling, deep-hearted lyrics, mark Austrailian Simon Bonney's excellent foray into the experience of the American West.Filled with wonder, searching, beauty,"" I saw an eagle climb up into the midday sky, it had both eyes closed and I heard him cry how much longer can I keep the dream alive?""-from White Suit in Memphis.Very much worth discovering."
5,Works well.,This paper works really nicely for all purposes. Its good for tracing and good for soft drawing. I think the texture is perfect for all sorts of techniques.
4,"I love it, but its pricy","This is excellent paper. It's a little expensive for me (though it has come down in price a lot) , it handles graphite, ink, and markers without any bleeding whatsoever. I am particularly fond of the light weight, brightness, the smoothness, and the translucency... It's not cheap-feeling like tracing paper, though it can be employed as tracing paper if you needed it to. I do a lot of character design and animation, and my base sketches are always drawn on an 8.5x11 pad of this stuff. If you erase a lot when you draw, lines lift from this very easily and won't linger like on thick drawing paper or cheap copy paper. So if you have the bad habit of bearing down too much weight on your lead, you might get a break from this. Graphite works well, but its obviously best for markers or ink, Prismacolor markers in particular, if you can afford them. In all, this is the best paper I have used, though you might be able to find something that's just as good for less."
1,Incredibly Disappointed!,"I was looking for a pad that would work well with markers and it was acid free. First of all, I noticed that the sheets are incredibly thin, which stroked me as a bit odd for being marker paper. I start to trace over my drawing and when I begin to pen ink it, I noticed that it took an incredibly long time to dry and it smeared. I waited literally about 20 mins before I started coloring in with my copic markers and immediately after the first stroke, the ink from the pen was smudging into the marker ink. Not long after use, the paper began to bleed a lot even though it says it is bleed resistant. I am now going to try the Neehan Classic Crest Solar White 80LB, since it was recommended by a lot of copic users."
2,Could do better!,"I've read a lot about this man and was surprised to find a book about him in my local bookshop. However, I was dissapointed when I finally got down to reading the book and actually got so bored I didn't finish it!It unfortunately reads like someone's Masters thesis. This attempt at writing is abissmal, and should never have been printed before a decent (mass-market) editor looked at it. Could have been a lot better is really all I'm saying."
3,Disappointed,"I love Linda Castillo and have read all of her books - this one was predictable and disappointing. While she does a great job, as usual, with tension, the relationship between the H/H seemed contrived and artificial - as though she rushed through the book. I enjoyed her other books and look forward to more depth to the characters - otherwise, good book and a 3 star only in comparison to other other books."
4,Cobra history,The book is very complete. I will need to read it again to absorb more of the information contained in it.
3,WHERE THE SONG HEY AZ?,"Pieces of a Man was an alright album. But it could have been alot better. For one reason, the album was orginally suppose to come out in the summer of 1997. I thought AZ lead single to that album was Hey AZ featuring SWV. Which was a tighter song compared to the new lead single What's the Deal. Then I found out once I got the long awaiting album that Hey AZ wasn't even on there! After the Firm Album, AZ told a magazine (I think it was the Source) that the Firm's Desperados song was suppose to be on Pieces of a Man. Many people said AZ lack hits on this album. Those where two rap songs that could have brought Pieces of a Man to the top of the charts. In conclusion, AZ and Nas will have to make up their mind when their albums come out. Many of their fans like myself get mad with them for keep changing their release date."
4,A classic but not the best,This album is a great album but its not AZs best. If this was any other rapper this would be the album that they would be remembered by. The best song on this album is How Ya Livin feat Nas. This is probably the best AZ song of all time.
2,Tape this from someone else or somethin'!,"AZ's stock took quite a drop after realeasin' this album. He fell into the same category that Nas did with ""It Was Written"". AZ tried to gain the MTV viewers, but lost his trip hip-hop heads at the same time. Maybe a few songs here and there kept me goin', but overall, you should jus tape it from someone who went out and bought it. I don't think any CD is worth about 2 or 3 songs out of 15 that you can only keep playin'. If he does release another LP, he needs to sit down and think about things before anything can happen."
1,"IF YOU HAVE MONEY TO BURN, THAN BUY THIS ALBUM","Not a very good performance by AZ. it makes you wonder, would AZ have made it if he didn't debute with Nas? In my opinion, no. Stop advertising crystal and versase, and start dropping dope lyrics and hype beats."
4,AZ is given no credit on this album,"Pieces of Man wasn't a bad album. I thought it was pretty good. Az didn't market the album the way he was suppose to. The radio station around my way didn't play his lead single that much. And I still haven't seen one of his new songs on TV. What's the Deal was tight. But maybe he should have came with something like Pieces of a(Black) Man or the Last Dayz with Monifah. Az still a good rap artist, but he should have gave his Firm sister Foxy Brown more than a 10 minute rap. Az will have come back more stronger next time around."
4,"Good for small companies, too","Good thinking, clear writing -- a nice change in the world of Internet books. I do marketing for an Internet start-up & found many of the recommendations here to be applicable to new ventures like ours."
5,one of the best,"phil carpenter has written a classic on the ""ebrands"" of todays hetic business/e world. insightful and very helpful in todays everchanging world. recommend it highly!"
2,Offers Little to the Marketer,"I give up! I struggled to read through this book. Phil Carpenter attempts to present how Internet brands are developed by presenting ""case studies"" on six well-known companies. The marketing strategies of these companies (iVillage, CDNow, BarnesandNoble.com, Yahoo!, FogDog Sports, and OnSale) are detailed in a manner filled with ""buzzwords"" but little in the way of thoughtful analysis or performance measurement.Carpenter follows the same business methodology of many Internet companies today in believing that ""big numbers"" translate into success. As we have seen this is a flawed formula. Further, the simplisitic discussions of banner ads, viral marketing, etc., provides little insight into eBrand management for your organization. Specifically, Carpenter never makes the connection between an eBrand and profit.If you are attempting to formulate an internet-based marketing strategy a much better read is Seth Yodin's book on Permission Marketing."
2,You get what you pay for,"These headphones are pretty terrible. I know $10 isn't a lot to spend on headphones, but do yourself a favor and just buy some $25 ones so you don't have to buy twice. They are reasonably comfortable, but the sound quality is just awful. They are tinny, and the bass is muffled and/or nonexistent. The cord is also ""gummy"". As in it is kind of elastic and rubbery and will retain its folded up shape if you do fold it or tie it up.I suppose this will be a good backup set."
2,Are These People Insane?,"I don't know what book the other reviewers read but it certainly wasn't this book. About half-way through the book I closed it, put it back in it's packaging, and asked amazon for my money back...It was just that bad. I don't call myself a singles expert, but I have read plenty of books on the single experience, and this, by far was a joke. The author seemed to have a problem with staying on the subject. She'd begin with a really great point then drift into a story about her friends or some wierd experience she had. It left me literally dazed and confused. I just didn't get it. How did the story relate to the point she was trying to make? At any rate, this book proves the saying once again, never judge a book by it's cover. The cover of this book has some really good key points to draw you in. The inside, however, is a hollow catastrophe."
5,Helped Me A lot,"So I read this book when i was in high school, and I loved it. As you know people are dating a lot earlier these days, and I wanted to join in with the crowd. Unfortunately the average guy isn't looking for a long term relationship so early and that caused much heartbreak, and emotional turmoil for me. So I read this book in order to help me to stop wanting to join the crowd and just be happy being single and waiting for the appropriate time that God had for me. And it did just that. For those who think this book is not good, perhaps you could pass it down to someone younger and it will give them some direction in life, help them see that jumping from guy to guy isn't their only option for fulfillment. :)"
5,I loved this book,"I am 24 and have been through a rough time with trying to understand God's plan for me and why I have to get my heart broken. This book was great, it was upbeat and down to earth and I loved everything. This is a book that got me focused back on the things that I needed to be focused on, God. I would recommend the book to anyone that was went through a broken heart. The book was great and very helpful."
4,pretty solid work,"after ""isn't anything"" an endless stream of shoegaze bands seemed to appear, many with very mediocre blocks of noice. That said, Loop is an exception. They do a great job creating a very distinctive mood, one that is hopelessly bleak and dark, without being depressing. This album isn't incredible, hence why Loop is seen today as an obscure band, however, if you have all of your sonic youth and my bloody valentine and are looking for some solid, bleak, noise, Loop and ""a guilded eternity"" will fill your craving."
3,Not what I was looking for,I also was not looking for the concert video. I was looking for the movie that starred Kathleen York and Viveka Davis. Can anyone help?
4,My Favorite Female Artist,"i also thought like Mrs. Bone, I thought it was about their life story and I also have been looking for the movie about the Judds."
3,Average,"This was their final studio album, and it plays like an overly-produced swan song. Some numbers, like ""This Country's Rockin'"" are pure filler. On the other hand, ""Born to Be Blue"" has some teeth, and the title track is touching. Overall, though, you'd be better off buying either of their two Greatest Hits sets."
4,A multi-faceted story of a video made amid scenic grandeur.,"This includes an in-depth story of how the ""Bridge"" music video was made among the wild and beautiful red rock buttes and pinnacles of Sedona, AZ. It interweaves the close relationship between Naomi Judd and her daughter Wynonna with another allegory of intolerance and reconciliation between diverse ethnic peoples. The video also includes scenes of Naomi's wedding and private life. The finished music video, ""Love Can Build a Bridge"", is in 3D and done with highly professional polish."
3,the Judds love can built a bridge,I liked this vidoe but was expecting the Judds life story as seen on TV Please tell me where I can get that vidoe
5,Relaxing Feel Good Music!,"I absolutly adore and love the Judds! This CD is great, #2 'Calling in the Wind', is a beautiful song! This is a CD that you should absolutly add to your collection of Judd CD's! Like most of their songs Love Can Build A Bridge is a CD that makes you feel strong! Naomi Judd actually wrote three songs and Wynonna wrote one song! This one's a Winner!!"
3,Not the movie I thought it was,"This was ot the movie I thought it was. Although it is filled with awesome Judds music, I thought I was getting the life story from the book Naomi wrote. But again, still great Judds music!"
1,'Kinky Kong' (E.I.),"Totally absurd 3rd rate trash film of a wise-cracking movie director Seymour *sse looking to make a movie with 'the preverted version' of the almighty King Kong - Kinky Kong, a stupid-looking (obvious) person in an ape costume that wears a huge diaper. Even the soft porn girl-on-girl action here is pretty much routine. I'll be fair here and there are a few semi-humorous moments but 'Kinky Kong' would be considered to be a complete waste of time to about 99 % of the surface population. Worth watching once, and I do mean once ONLY."
4,"A Fun but, Frightening Read","Having just read this book last night I can say it filled in a few blanks for me. Wonderful facts, all with references. But, really I think Begala is too kind to Dubya. I think Geo Jr. is a heartless fool who'll jump at any idiotic proposal he thinks will serve his cause, namely looking ""moral"" enough to dupe right wingers into supporting him so he can inflate his ego and wealth...."
5,Begala does what the media doesn't have the guts to do.,"This is a book that is funny but scary. Paul Begala points out it is a joke to seriously consider George W. Bush as a candidate for the presidency. This is a man who decided to become an adult around the age of 36. For all of Mr. Bush's talk of Al Gore puffing up his resume, it turns out that the successful business career that Mr. Bush had prior to public office was due mainly to sweetheart deals (by both the government and private individuals wanting to help out then-President Bush). This is what Joe Conason calls Bush's ""crony capitalism (see Conason's great article on Bush's business dealings in a recent article for Harper's Magazine). Let's hope enough voters head Mr. Begala's words."
4,"Caution: Liberals, Read At Your Own Risk.","Good intro to the dangers of another Bush in office. The book is also funny, not to mention scary. You may want to have some tranquilizers on hand. Follow this book up with Michael Moore's Stupid White Men and you may suffer a stroke."
4,Informative and entertaining,"I read this book a few years ago (when Bush was still in office) and after reading this, I was stunned at the fact that he even made it to the White House. Lackluster grades, failed businesses... oh, wait, he had his Daddy's friends helping him out! This book was rather informative on Bush's history, and it also gives some information on Cheney's own history - wow, that man really is a heartless creep. If you want to learn more facts and trivia about Bush and his history, this is a rather good book to read. Yes, it's not entirely neutral and is rather snarky in a few parts, but it's rather well-deserved snark considering what Bush has done in office."
1,Bias,"This writer has a biased disregard for many truths. Bush actually made excellent grades in college. He does have an articulation problem but some people are too biased to look beyond that. Clinton almost destroyed the CIA which is one of the many reasons the attack on the USA couldn't be stopped.Thank God we have a real leader in The White House. Clinton looked the other way when the Cole was attacked. Gore would probably have done the same thing if he had been president on Sept. 11, 2001!"
1,National Enquirer - type writing,"Not for the intelligent reader for sure. Mr. Begala screams out accusation with very little support. I had trouble wading through this book without scoffing.For the serious political minded person, I would refer them to George Will (Conservatives) or Jesse Jackson (Liberal)"
5,K.A. Kegley is a moron,I HAVE read the book and it is great. Don't review(8/9/04) a book you haven't read.
1,"Lame, Written by Hack","Lame insults against President G.W. Bush.Now, why isn't anyone asking about President Obama's grades?Oh, that's right. We aren't allowed to ask, are we?Be afraid; be very afraid."
1,Biased and inaccurate,"Like his campaign consulting firm partner, James Carville, Begala fights political battles through misleading soundbites. There may be much to like or dislike in Bush's policies, but there is no serious analysis to be found here. The title comes from a Bush verbal grammatical error from the end of a long day of campaigning, and this choice of title shows the sophmoric nature of the book."
4,"Biased, but fun","Begala's tone is often disparaging and nasty, but it doesn't seem all that bad when you consider who's occupying the White House.I gave it four stars because I want to see Bush make for Texas as much as Begala does."
2,The exact opposite of the Clinton story,"Paul Begala's detailed account of the low points of President Bush's early years is historically relevant, if unbalanced reading. Clearly the agenda here is to weaken the confidence of the voting public in a surprisingly popular President. If the reader accepts Begala's agenda and reads the book just for the ""facts"", this becomes a story of a fortunate man almost throwing away his advantages in life, then finding redemption as a gifted and popular leader. I am giving a copy to my son in hopes that he will not make the same mistakes President Bush made early in life. The book does present an ironic contrast to President Clinton. Clinton started with so little, excelled in school, kissed the girls and charmed the people, then squandered the voters' trust and his opportunity to make history...If only he had experienced the failures Bush did as a young man, he might not have floundered at such a critical time in his own career."
1,Don't Bother- Keep the aminal caged,"I bought this book for my nephew because I have a copy of it from when I was a child and loved it. The magic of the book lies in the illustrations. In my copy from the Seventies, the images look as if they have been painted with water colours and are very beautiful. This modern reprint, however, is on glossy, waxy paper and the pictures look 'flat' and washed out. It has lost all the original 'just painted' look and the slightly psychedelic colours in the illustrations. It took away all the magic and prettiness of the book. I was very disappointed. I regret wasting my money."
2,Doesn't really last,"Lip Ink is overpriced and doesn't last all day--in fact, it is almost gone by lunchtime. It is time-consuming to put on (3 coats plus shine). There are many colors to choose from. You may return it only if it is unopened (then how do you try it?) or if it smears (it doesn't). The drugstore long-lasting brands, such as Maybelline or L'Oreal, last a bit longer and are cheaper."
5,"Spin, spin, SPIN!","And power. There's definitely a lot of power on that string. It's very comfortable. The best spin string; used by our under 12... 12th ranked player. If someone that young feels content with a string, you know it's good!"
5,Great book for this area of Japanese movie posters,"For this niche in collecting of Japanese movie posters, this book is great. It covers some uniquely Japanese genres -- Yakuza, Pink, Kaiju (monsters), etc., and serves that purpose well. However, just a couple notes in addition to the comments already made: first, if you're looking for Japanese posters for Western films (American, European, etc.) this is not going to cover that. Second, it does not cover more modern posters so if you're looking for new popular titles like Amelie, Lost in Translation, and the ever-popular Kill Bill, this obviously won't work.That said, again, great book for what it is. An excellent reference and a good start for a collector's library."
3,its a bumper sticker....,Not much I can say about this but it is a bumper sticker. I got it for my boss who is a Dodge driver and I drive a Chevy.
1,No Architecture Here,"except for some of the illustrations, which could have been anything, as a famous man once said. This is a general concepts book, that's all, and the price is too high. Get Omura's Mastering AutoCAD 2000 instead...better discussion of general concepts, and even some architectural examples...and the price is much easier to take. Maybe there's a real ""AutoCAD for Architects"" book out there, but I haven't found it yet."
2,Do not buy,"this thing will collapse with just mild wind, spend the extra $100 to get a quality screenhouse, flimsy materials in this product do not hold up"
3,Not Water proof,This assembles easily and works well. But it is not water proof at all. Don't count on it in the rain
2,Ripped top and Ripped off,Bought this product this summer and the top ripped on first setup . Sent product back to parent company American Recreation Products for a repacement. And was sent a Eddie Bauyer 13 by 15 astoria screen house that is completly worthless to me. Its twice as heavy and needs a least two people to set it up. Called customer service and talked to a person who was the very rude . She acted like she was the customer. Ended up with a worthless piece of junk that is nothing like the original. American Recreation Products could careless about customer satisfaction.
2,Not what I was expecting,"I purchased the screen tent to take it with us to Vancouver Island on vacation. The only good thing about it is the easy set up. The slanted sides allow the rain to pour in. The shape cuts into the space inside. You can only get a picnic table (placed directly in the middle) in it with walking room around the table. Also, at the bottom edge of the doors there is a flap that was always getting in the way. People were constantly tripping over it. The door zipper doesn't zip all the way down to the ground."
2,Barely adquate,"The unit is flimsy. the stitching and fabric are of inferior material and not properly UV protected. The frame is weak, to the point of being almost fragile. This is not a product that will stand up to anything stronger than a light breeze and certainly not for use in rainy weather. In short it falls into the same catagory as lighters, razors etc., it's Disposable."
4,Very nice screen house,"I am very pleased with this screen house. Set up was pretty easy, only took myself and 10 y/o son about 15 minutes. Haven't had any problems with this one at all!!You can't beat this one for the price and quality."
3,Quality Control,"The screen room was just what I wanted size and weight, the problem was in Wenzel's quality control, one of the base support pole was defective at the connection point, a scrunched and protruding knob which could rub the fabric and cause a tare and weaken the encloser for further rips. the factory was informed and the sent another to replace the damaged one, after waiting a week or so I got the replacement, it was not as good as the defective one I had, the rubber band that allows for quick connection was rusty and not installed properly allowing it to come out of it's connection if lifted.As for the company that I purchased the item from they were timely in there service with there provider, it's the provider that needs help in Quality Control of there product."
5,screen house,Am very satisfied with this product. Material wise and price. The area of coverage was enough for us to occupy one camping table provided by the campsite. Very easy to assemble. camping was comfortable with yellowjackets unable to enter your dining area.ifontok.
2,Wimpy stakes,"The very first time I used the screen house I was camping at Hatteras. The stakes are wholly inadequate. That night brought a huge storm which blew away the tent. I recovered it 500 yards away with two of the poles severely bent. The house itself was roomy and reasonably easy to set up - you do need two people. If you buy it, go get some serious stakes because those that come with it are pitiful."
2,poles bend with very little resistance,"We were excited to get this screen house because of the great reviews we read. This was an inexpensive price and seemed like it would be sufficient for our needs. As we opened the box, however, we were disappointed to see how flimsy the poles were. One of the poles bent and creased at the curved section where it goes up over the sidewall just with my husband and three kids setting it up. If we had been in a strong wind or trying to drag the shelter I could understand the easy damage, but this just has poor quality poles. The actual screen enclosure seemed fine ."
5,good tent for the money,fairly easy to set up and very durable during windy situations. also has a better waranty than most tents of this type
1,all bent up,"just putting this thing together the poles bent,had to be sent back. Only refunded part of money. Didn't know product was so FRAGILE."
2,Disappointing purchase,"I purchased this about a month ago to replace a Walmart brand screen house that got ruined last fall (my fault for not bringing it in before the first snowfall!) Walmart no longer sells a hexagonal screen house of similar size, or I would have bought the exact same model again. As soon as I took the Wenzel out of the box (no nice carry bag like the Walmart one!), I could feel the flimsiness of the poles. Sure enough, while setting it up, one of the pole tips bent. When I called Wenzel, they would not stand behind their product. After it taking about a week to get through to them on the phone, they told me to disassemble the screen house, and mail them the pole back (at my expense), and then they would decide whether it was ""a warranty issue or not"". After telling their clerk how disappointed I was at the lack of product support, I hung up, and I guess I will live with a bent pole. Spend your money elsewhere - Wenzel has cheap, flimsy poles, and no customer product support."
4,Nice screen tent,This is the nicest screen tent we've seen. Very roomy and well made. We had no trouble setting it up although the last couple of legs were difficult to get into the pockets because the fabric is very tight.
1,broke with first use,"It look nice, but the poles are very flimsy and bent the first time we had it up. Very disappointed with this product."

5,"Fifteen years later, it's still in me","When I first heard ""We Don't Do That Anymore"" as a college kid on a Tucson radio station, I loved it right away. I thought it was from some soon-to-be-huge national act, not a local oufit with a singer, Dave Slutes, who I kept running into at the Home Den and the Smith's on Campbell. Fifteen years later, it's still one of my favorites. I originally loved ""We Don't Do That Anymore"" and ""Sara's Not Sober,"" but ""Little Boy"" grabbed me soon after and never let go. And ""Came On Like The Sun"" -- wow. What a beautiful sentiment. A band this good, with a sound this distictive -- I don't know why they didn't break out of Tucson. But I love the feeling that when I listen to this CD, I know that I'm probably the only person in the world hearing the same words at the same time."
2,Written by and for True Believers,"I own a dozen introductory linguistics textbooks, and this is my least favorite. Physically, the book is short and thick, with narrow margins, which makes it hard to read without breaking the spine. There are few exercises, and almost none include data from languages other than English. The bibliography slightly exceeds four pages. It is the only introductory textbook I have ever seen without a glossary.The title is misleading. This book is really an introduction to Chomskyan generative grammar, not an introduction to linguistics. Students who read this book will be plunged into the world of empty categories, covert movement, Merge, and the Economy Principle; on the other hand, they will never encounter the terms spectrogram, ergative, pragmatics, or Indo-European. If that sounds like your idea of what an introduction to linguistics should be, then I suppose this is the book for you."
2,Not the best introduction,"Has a really backwards explanation on page 131 paragraph 3: ""...we have appealed to three types of criteria..."" (here the 3 criteria are finally revealed!! after you have waded though several paragraphs with no way of knowing what the material was getting at in the first place!)The book does have some great areas of excellent discussion, and it gives a small treatment of pragmatics at the end (Chap 27 Using Sentences). The material though does not seem to be at an introductory level. Though it is a hardbound book and does use high quality paper, one-hundred thirty dollars for this textbook is too much, given there are others that are better as introductions for far less money!"
3,Great Reference but difficult to follow,"The author makes a study of Puerto Rican houses throughout history. The book is well documented and includes ""a lot"" of nice pictures and drawings. The only problem with the book is that is difficult to follow. The lecture makes reference to the pictures and drawings so the reader can visualize better the different house types. Many times the pictures are located one or two pages later from the descriptive paragraph. Because of this I was caught flipping back and forward the pages throughout the book. This makes it a little hard to read. Aside from that the book is a good reference and have a lot of valuable information. A must for architects and anthropologist interested in Puerto Rico."
2,Can be better,"As a Puertorrican Architecture student, who has been working on the documentation and investigation of this book, I disagree on how Jopling adjudges some of the architectural styles to the Puertorrican houses. Personally I think that she should have undergo a more extensive investigation and have taken better photographs. Thank you."
3,76ers SIXERS,My name is Daniel Neubauer and that is Ronald McDonald. I was born in Philadelphia in 1974 and that is when and where they founded the Ronald McDonald House. I am a Jew and I was 2 during the Bicentennial. On my 25th birthday King Hussein of Jordan died and Thanksviving was on November 25th 1999. On my 28th birthday Princess Margaret died and Thanksgiving was on November 28th 2002. On my 33rd birthday Anna Nichole Smith has died. I thought I would play for the Seventy-Sixers because of the Ronald McDonald House's The SIXERS Read For Ronald.X-Men Colossias.
4,Can be made to fit Z3 sub enclosure,"This speaker can be made to fit the factory subwoofer enclosure of BMW Z3's and can be driven by the stock amplifier. You need to cut and remove the metal can (magnetic shielding) around the speaker magnet and trim mounting flange but any careful cave man can do it. The sound is OK, especially when you consider it's small size and that it's being driven by the horrible BMW subwoofer amp."
5,Great Sub!,"I have recently started to do my first speaker project and decided to buy this as my sub for my Bose Companion 2 (Left&Right) wired to my Onkyo TX-17 Quartz Synthesized Tuner Amplifier, and if wired and boxed correctly this thing will THUMP. Great sound especially with the added voice coil, i never knew subs could produce treble so well like this, i tested blu-ray movies and games along with some rock n' roll cd's and the sound is thrilling!. GREAT BUY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!:)"
4,Another excellent album,"Slightly different from previous albums, after a few listens, I couldn't stop! Angel and Teardrop are excellent tracks."
5,I need a little love to ease the pain....,Two Words to describe : SIMPLY AMAZING!!All the tracks ar incredible...!!!Just BUY IT right now!
4,a very satisfying dream.,"Many artists who classify themselves as trip-hop or downbeat don't hold a candle to this album. Deep, transendental, dark, laid-back, and ultimately satisfying, Massive Attack's third LP is their greatest. I liked ""Angel"", and ""Risingson"" was good, but I thought having two abstract vocalists on one song was kind of silly. ""Teardrops,"" now being featured on almost every ""chillout"" compilation, is very nice and soothing, featuring Portishead. The rest of the album is nice and deep, with those trademark sinister-but-harmless vocals that made Massive Attack famous. A nice album."
3,where's the energy?,Blue Lines had power. Protection was much more mellow. Mezzanine has furthered the progression to the point of dullness. No standout songs on this CD. I'll listen to it but not like the first two CDs.
5,Great album,This is a very good an well recorded album I had not heard of this group before or at least I thought but some of the songs were familiar. I recommend this album it is excellent.
2,this is not a LP,Felt mislead with LP-replica in the title. Quality of CD recording does not sound like it is an official production release.
5,MASSIVE ATTACK's MASTERPIECE!!!!!,"MEZZANINE is another masterpiece from MASSIVE ATTACK!!!! This is just the perfect music to relax and reflect about life...Its either great in a party!!!! It's amazing!!! The mix of REGGAE, HIP HOP, eletronic and ROCK are worderful on MEZZANINE!!! A MUSIC MASTERPIECE!!!! Try BLUE LINES and PROTECTION too....WELL DONE, MASSIVE ATTACK!!!!!"
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"I first heard this CD in a candle lit room while drinking African tea, and in a matter of minutes I was totally held by the music. It is beautifully and artfully composed, with hauntingly sexy vocals, spiritually tingling sounds, and it completely lulls you into a state of meditation. It is definately one of my favourite CD's, and every time I listen to it I hear something new. It is quite simply a brilliant work of art."
5,Seven years and still addicted,"I picked this up in 1998, in Ottawa, on a blind whim. I didn't know what ""trip-hop"" was, who Massive Attack was, or what the album was going to sound like (I just thought the cover was cool). I popped in into my rental-car stereo -- and was totally blown away. I drove around aimlessly for two hours so I could keep listening.Seven years later, Mezzanine's still near the top of my 500-album stack, in heavy rotation.This album crosses dozens of genre lines but doesn't bow to any of them. Somehow, M.A. managed to synthesize something completely new out of borrowed pieces of hip-hop, classical, anthem rock, metal, industrial and its own pre-Mezzanine sound. I'm waiting for another group of artists to achieve something even remotely as imaginative and ahead of its time as Mezzanine.Even if the Bristol sound isn't your thing, you have to appreciate Mezzanine as a creative stroke of genius. If you like music at all, you'll be well rewarded for giving it a listen."
4,It's a trip.,"I don't know too much about their other albums, but I can't imagine any other being better than ""Mezzanine"". You can call this trip-hop or electronica if you want, but this is just cool mood music that is beyond beautiful. Perfect for putting on after the bars at home, with that last drink or smoke of the night. With guest vocals from ""The Cocteau Twins"" singer, and a cool sample of ""The Cure"" on track seven, you know this is gonna be good. ""Teardrop"" was the big song from this, and the rest is just as moving. It will go great with your ""Portishead"" and ""Sneaker Pimps"" cd's."
5,to this day one of my 5 favorite cds,"I bought this cd back in 1998, after seeing the video for teardrop on some late night ""alternative"" cable music show. It was one of the most beautiful songs I'd ever heard.I was thoroughly surprised and delighted to discover, on purchasing the album, that the entire thing was incredible. No matter how many times I listen to it, the hair on the back of my neck still stands up on ""Angel"".I put this cd on in my car when its a rainy day, and I have a long drive. It's ability to calm me is almost ""zen-like"".Recently, when creating a bunch of themed playlists of my mp3's I was impressed to discover that this album was put on both my ""sex"" and ""murder"" playlists. After listening to it, I think it is apparent as to why it is appropriate for both.Even after all these years, its still one of the best cd's I've ever heard. I highly recommend it."
5,I enjoyed this album very much!,"Mezzanine is great fun. Being new to the genre, I expected a much more aggressive band (with a name like ""Massive Attack""), but I was delighted to hear smoother, jazzier grooves and hooks. It gets better every time I listen to it, and it's fast becoming one of my favorite albums. Simple as that!"
3,Disappointing,"Unfortunately I can't share the opinion of the other reviewers. With this album M.A. did not meet my expectations. Ofcourse Horace Andy is great again and I enjoyed hearing Liz Phraser, but the album just did not give me the urge to keep on playing it, to rediscover it. Some songs even bored me. Still I can't be to harsh on them (?!)(3 stars) and I hope the next one will be better again"
5,Raves from a Cocteau Twin Fan,"Liz Fraser is back! The songs she sings in are the cherry on top of the worlds best hot fudge sundae. Her voice and Massive Attack's wonderful music compliment each other like in the early Cocteau Twin albums. I've been a fan of electronica since the beginning (I even had an LP when I was a kid titled ""Joy!"" which was a collection of classical ""hits"" re-done electronically) and this has got to be one of the best ones I've heard. I'll play this until the laser burns through the CD! Do yourself a favor and dump Kid Rock and that M&M kid and buy this CD. This is where its at!"
