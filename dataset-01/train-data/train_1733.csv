2,orange or green? What button art thou?,"Before you order a replacement remote, make sure to check the back of the garage door motor unit. If you push the learn button, it will lit either green or orange. The remote controls are color specific. I learned the hard away after receiving the remote. The unit came from Sanford and Son Doors. It's not their fault. Amazon's product description does mention about the 2 colors but because of my haste to get the product, I did not read it. In Sanford and Son Doors' web site, they offer free shipping if you order from them. BLNT :("
4,Functions as expected,"Simple, basic, functional. Exactly what I needed. I was glad to still be able to obtain one of these remotes to control an older overhead door."
4,Not perfect but good enough. Have American accent.,"Nice visual. Have about 6 repititions (2 from teacher, about 4 or more from different kids) for each of its word (or alphebet) which I like it. The down side is they are not native. Some of the kids says it in a English accent. And one of the reviews that I saw said one word is prononced wrongly. However, Compare to other spanish educational dvds (eg Mi Casa My House), I'd recommend this one. If it's not for the American accent, I would definetly give it a 5 stars. Only have 2 songs. The spanish ABC song which is good. The other song is fun but it's in English saying something like learning Spanish is fun and useful."
1,LOVE the item .... But PRICE??? HIGHWAY ROBBERY!,"The cheapest new price for this is $69??? What the hell? I had the CD for this years ago, and loved the music. A certain relative who won't be named used it, didn't put it back in the cover when he/she was done, and got it scratched up, so when I saw Longplay available online, I said ""great""! Now I'm saying ""HIGHWAY ROBBERY!"" NO SALE from THIS amazon shopper!"
1,There are real chalkboard papers out there - this is not one of it,"Very slick, doesn't take chalk at all. I sanded it, cured it twice (rubbing chalk on it), still doesn't write as well as a normal chalkboard would. I did paste it on a flat, quite smooth surface. I've bought chalkboard paper that wasn't too much more expensive than this on Etsy, and that paper has a rough surface that you can write VERY easily on. People who said they could write on this chalkboard paper obviously never used a good chalkboard before...Skip this and go elsewhere. Couldn't return this product because I was so confident with the good reviews, I cut out a large chunk to use, only to find out it's unuseable."
5,Chalkboard Buffet table,The paper performed exactly as described. I used it as asort of tablecloth for a Christmas gathering and drew withchalk around the various dishes describing what the hors'doverswere and drawing various pictures. It was a hit and the paperwas easily removable after the party.
2,"Easy to use, but impossible to remove.","Lots of fun applying this, like any other contact paper to nearly any surface. Great if you only need to use it one time, but the chalk ""burns"" into the surface (like our computer screens would do w/out a screen saver). Seemed like a great idea, but wouldn't rec. if needed for repeated or frequent use."
1,"Rubbery, hard to stick and smooth out","It took me more than 45 minutes to get this contact paper to properly stick onto a wall surface. I was constantly having to re-position it to smooth out air bubbles and wrinkles. The awkward dimensions (18""x6') may have added to the difficulty, but I suspect that the poor quality of the material was more to blame. I also don't like the semi-glossy appearance and prefer a matted look that is more similar to traditional chalkboards. I'll stick to Wallie brand chalkboard paper from now on, which has never given me trouble, and won't purchase this Contact Brand again. (In fact, I'll probably eventually replace this paper with Wallie -- much happier with that brand.) Very annoying product."
4,Easy to apply,"Quick delivery. Exactly as described. Easy to apply to wall, but you need two people to do it because of the length. However, every bump and mark on the wall can be felt through the paper. I put it up on my classroom cement wall and it takes on the rough surface. Even though, it is still usable just a little tougher to write on. I would buy it again."
4,Good,"New style blackboard is good stuff if you have kids around or just enjoy having the freedom to visually aid learning, or whatever else you might wanna use it for. Peel on-off is clean. I wish it would be a little thicker, hence the 4*."
4,Works great!,"I used this contact paper on mat board to make three chalk boards for people to write on at an event. It was very easy to apply and with a bone folder it was very easy to put it on with no bubbles. At first it looked very strange, but once I got some chalk on it they looked great! They looked so much like chalkboard that it led to disappointment when people picked them up. The mat board is much lighter than a chalkboard and that emphasized the slightly slippery contact paper texture feeling of it as you hold it in your hands and distracted people as they wondered what it was. Practically it worked beautifully, took the chalk great, looked great, erased great, and was very very cheap and fast to make. However, if I had been planning for the long term for boards to make and use again and again I would have chosen something slightly heavier to mount it on since it is more pleasing overall if it doesn't confuse people when they pick it up and leave them wondering."
1,I would NOT order this,This is NOT chalkboard paper. It is plain black contact paper. I tried to do the project I had planned for it and the chalk won't even wipe off... it won't wash off! I have used chalkboard paper before and this is far from it. I do not recommend this if you are seeking chalkboard style paper.
1,False advertisement,I bought this to cover up worn chalk boards and it does not work as advertise. It is simply contact paper that works once a a surface for chalk and that's it. It does not erase well and leaves marks. They should not advertise as chalkboard paper. Don't buy this.
3,Just Black Contact Paper,"Disappointed to find this is JUST BLACK CONTACT PAPER. Nothing on the outside says ""chalkboard"" I have not opened it to try it, because I was disappointed to see it wasn't accurate to the description. I could purchase this at a normal school supply store."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is simply a bad product. It in no way has the texture of ""chalkboard"" paint. To me, it feels like regular black contact paper. Chalk does not erase and normal chalk scratches the surface. It is also a pain to work with and anywhere it creases - even in the package - leave a huge blemish on your ""chalkboard"". This might be ok to use dry erase on but definitely not chalk. Go buy paint instead."
2,Chalkboard Paper,"This paper is really just black contact paper. The chalk did write on it, but not without having to go over it a number of times to be able to see it. Not a coarse enough surface to really hold the chalk.It was a good price though and for an at home project worked out okay."
2,Am I really the only one?,This chalk board paper really didn't work ..... I can't even write with chalk on it at all ... it sort of shows up but not really .... Wish I would of known this before I covered my whole wall in it. Very big waste of my money seeing I bought quite a few. Very dissapointed.
2,Disappointed :(,I was really excited to get this because I wanted to make my own chalkboard speech bubbles for my son's 1st birthday. No matter how I applied the contact paper it left bubbles that I could not remove. Once I got past the fact that there were going to be some air bubbles (that maybe would not be seen once there was writing on them and in photographs) I tried to write on this contact paper and it would not hold the chalk. I was very disappointed! I had to go to the Home Depot and buy Rustoleum Chalkboard spray. That worked MUCH better!!!
5,wonderful,"Great quality. I was worried since I had never used the product, however the stick was great and the product wad easy for me to cut. Much faster than chalkboard paint! Chalks working great on it as well. Timely delivery."
5,Works AWESOME,"I just got this to put on the wall for my 3 year old son. Our walls are textured but I tried it anyway and I'm so glad I did! All I did was cut a 3 foot section and put it on the wall and gave him chalk and a cloth. He drew on it over and over and it wiped right off. It works exactly like a regular chalk board. I'm pretty sure it is just black contact paper, but it doesn't matter, it works! I'm going to check the store for black contact paper and see if that works to put some in all the kids rooms. This sticks really well too, I even pulled it off and put it in a different spot and it sticks great."
4,Perfect for projects!,"I was so glad that I was able to find this on amazon! I used it for a DIY project for our wedding and it worked really well. It wasn't too sticky and could be moved around easily if needed. While the chalk does seem to scratch it a little bit, it still worked well for my purpose. Definitely recommended!"
1,Waste of $$$$$,"Doesn't stick !!!!! Couldn't get it stick, followed directions ended up buying chalk board for big box home improvement store."
3,Not sticky,"Looks great, but not sticky. Used on a leather sofa, it will pill off if you sit on it.Not worth the price."
2,Chalk doesn't go on well.,"I was disappointed with this product. I primed it with chalk like other people suggested, but the chalk didn't go on that well. It isn't like a real chalkboard - not as good as chalkboard paint either. The chalk also leaves scratch marks on the vinyl that you can see after it is erased. Underwhelming product."
3,Well it was alright!!,With this product i found it to be a bit difficulty when trying to make it to adhere to the wall and other surfaces smoothly.
3,its ok for art projects,doent write on As well with regular chalk. with chalk markers would be great for a permanent sign or project
5,Looks Great!,"I have had this for just over a month and a half, it's still sticking great! I cut it in half and made it into a very cool headboard for a black platform twin size bed. My son thinks its awesome. It's useful as a friendly reminder to make the bed in the morning and put toys away at night, and gives my son a creative outlet without damaging the paint. I highly recomend this to any parent that needs to put up some reminders or a quick I love you. And college students, Great way to make a neon colored study calendar. I think anyone who needs a to-do list should buy this product, it cuts easy so you can put it in different areas or make it wider than it is long. Love it! Sticks GREAT!"
1,Disappointing Product,"I'm a huge contact paper fan, but they really dropped the ball with this one. I cured the paper by covering it with chalk and after erasing it, it still did not take normal chalk very well. To make matters worse, I tore the paper after just a few uses.We'll be redoing our blackboard with plywood and chalkboard spray paint instead."
2,not really like a chalk board,I was expecting a more matte finish like a real chalk board. This is basically black vinyl contact paper.
5,Awesome buy.,Just have like.. a credit card to lay it down properly.. its good quality highly recommend. Thanks again. 5 stars.
3,Used it for a wine party - got the job done,"This didn't meet my expectations, but it served its purpose. I only wish they had something a bit thicker and not so glossy. I used mine for a wine tasting party and didn't want to stick it to my table for fear of not getting it off, so I taped the ends down under the table top which worked ok. The sides wanted to roll up a bit though, so this is why I wished they had something a bit thicker. When I first received mine to look at it I wondered how well the chalk would work on it because it is a rather glossy surface, but it worked great! I see nothing else out on the market really, so if you're looking for some chalkboard paper this would be a good purchase."
5,Very true,I read a really long review on this and that made me buy this product. We plan on using it to make signs and it has done the job so far. Curing the chalkboard is a major thing though because it will not work if you don't!
5,Great Product!,"I've been looking for a way to leave messages in a noticeable, convenient place--my kitchen cabinet door--but did not want to deface the cabinet door by painting. Instead, I chose to use this chalkboard paper. It was really easy to apply and works great. If I don't want it there anymore, I can peel it away.I also used the chalkboard paper to label decorative storage boxes. I wasn't using the boxes because I couldn't tell what was inside. Now that I have them labeled, stationery, cardmaking, and photos are stored in my pretty boxes. Best of all the labels can be erased and changed. I love this product."
2,mixed bag,chalk board part works greatdoes not stick well which is the biggest complaintcleans wellvery flimsy tears easy
1,Very disappointed with this,"If I didn't absolutely have to have this for gifts I am making, I would have sent it back. This is NOT chalkboard paper. This is black contact paper, which I can get pretty much anywhere. It has no texture like chalkboard paper is supposed to have therefore dramatically takes away from the ""chalkboard"" effect. Do not buy this if you want chalkboard paper, this is just smooth contact paper."
2,meh,"Not as ""chalkboard"" like as I hoped but works okay. Serves a purpose but I don't think the chalk doesn't show up well."
3,"Decent. Not real chalkboard decent, but it works and it's not paint.","We used this to cover the sides of two bookshelves that we're using as head and footboard for a daybed. I cured and cured and cured before we started drawing on them with chalk but still we suffer from the ghost layer of chalk writing all over the surface. It's not a big deal for us, since it's for the kids to write on. But I would have rather had something I could actually, fully erase back to black."
3,Its ok.,I got two of them . Put one on my home fridge and it was fine and smooth. But second i put on a commercial cooler with glance serface. There was so many bubbles and i could not make it smooth
4,Good,Nothing extraordinary here. This is just your basic black contact paper useful for many different applications. Self-adhesive is easy to peel off and adhere. A good buy.
3,Not for chalk markers!,This does not work well with the liquid chalk markers.it will not fully erase :( So much for my creative menu board...
1,"chalk board contact paper,","I paid way more then I thought it was worth, before I even received it, when I got it, it was surely miss represented. And yes, I was completely disappointed , to see that it was really only black contact paper, and you could not write on it with the chalk . So, if you are looking to buy, go to the paint department and purchase a can of chalk paint, its a dream and it works and is not nearly as expensive as this misrepresented product."
4,Cardboard a Success,Great product. Some went on a cupboard door in my kitchen. Looks great and granddaughter loves drawing on the area she reach. I also put some on boxes on my desk that conceal clutter. I only regret not purchasing 2 rolls!
2,"Low quality, but passable for the price.","I got these because the size would be customizable with contact paper. It's also a very cheap way to get the most square footage of chalkboard, but it definitely shows. Even unmounted this paper doesn't take chalk very well. I put it on wood with a little texture and it wouldn't take chalk at all."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Don't waste your money. It's contact paper. It rips easy, doesn't show the writting with chalk. Go buy a $10 can of rustolium chalkboard paint."
4,Great value,"This is the cheapest way to convert a wall into a blackboard. However, this is basically just a sticky sheet of vinyl, so you will feel the bumps on the wall as you write. Still, that's not too much of a problem, and the value is overall very good."
5,Barbaro!!!,"It is a pleasure to listen to so-called ""salsa"" (it had been called afro-Cuban music in its various forms since the beginning of times)with lyrics that make sense and more than that, are poetry. The musicians and arrangements are superb. Just at the end, a very pleasant surprise - a ""cameo appearance"" by Silvio Rodriguez with Issac in ""Vamos a andar"": their two-part harmony is unbelievable. For connoisseurs, this track features intricate afro-Cuban rhythms. A must-have album."
2,Did not grab me.,This book did not grab me. Was not believable or interesting enough to finish. I quit reading after about one-fourth of the book.
4,Happy Driftin',"The songs on this CD are not the original versions from the early 60s & before, I think these ones were re-recorded by most of the original Drifters line-up some time in the early 70s. Nevertheless, as I was born in 1957, the versions on this CD are the ones I actually remember listening to on the radio when growing up. I have both sets of hits (this one and the Rhino remastered set of original hits) and this CD has, as you would expect, sound quality which is noticeably less harsh and edgy. I think it represents good value for money."
4,good.,"You won't disappointed if you buy this album. it doesn't rock. it's something to listen to while you're doing something tranquil. it's catchy but not shallow. it's really easy to like. I still like them better together though. the band she was in before putting out this album. oh yeah, azure ray. I actually want to get all of both of their solo albums. this album leads me to believe they will all be good."
2,Terry isn't faithful to the comics,"This is a poorly directed and acted serial, hardly faithful to the comic version and having no direction or movement. Terry is a younger than usual character, lacking the savvy of his comic namesake. There is none of the Asia intrigue, and the solution for each episode is a predictable fistfight. The Dragon Lady has none of the original mystery."
1,A Very Poor Example of the Classic Cliffhanger,"This certainly has to be one of the worst examples of the classic cliffhanger I have ever seen. The poor quality of the picture and sound track are enough to spoil any redeeming qualities the picture may have had --- if it had any. Very weak plot development combined with non-existant character development (many key character barely speak) and so cheaply done that it looks like they picked a wooded area in southern california and dressed it up with a few potted tropical plants to give it that ""jungle look"". Believe me, it does not! I own about 100 old cliffhanger serials and this is by far the worst I have ever had the displeasure to view. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,Need another battery,"Just put in yet another battery. They don't seem to hold a charge very long. I put my phone on the base every night, but sometimes, during the day, the battery will start beeping and it tells me I need to recharge. Disappointing."
3,Boring,"This game is kinda cool when you first start playing it, but then it gets preety dull. All you do is answer questions to defeat robots(which never go away). So, I strongly encourage you not to by this game."
2,WTF?,It's been ten minutes on my Kindle and I still have not got to the first story. There is no table of contents you can click on and get to the stories and just when I think I am done with the authors foolishness more comes up. I will write more later when and if I actually get to read a story
1,Never got item,"I would love to review this ring, but it never arrived. The ring was intended for a friend as a gift, but the address it was sent to turned out to be wrong, and the item did not forward. I emailed Old Glory twice and explained the problem, figuring the ring must have been returned by the postal service but got no response of any kind. I am now trying to get a refund via Amazon.com, who also have not yet responded. Apparently I am just out the $22 and shipping for a ring that neither my friend nor I ever received. While I appreciate that there was a problem with the address at my end, I have not been able to get as much as a response from Old Glory as to whether or not they got the ring back. I will not purchase another item from Old Glory."
4,Johnny Crash,Anybody that still likes that 80's glam bands will like Johnny Crash. The original cd is very hard to find but here is the good news. They plan to re-release their only album Neighborhood Threat and finally release a second album that was recorded back in 1992? that was never released due to possible legal action from Axel Rose since a couple of ex Guns & Roses members appear on the Album. Last I heard was that both CD's should be available sometime in December 2007.
2,Another rehash of old demo tapes,"Don't let the release date or the early 90's photo fool you... this album is nothing more than a rehash of old Hall and Oates demos and early unlicensed songs from the early '70s. You'll find the same songs (plus more) on Really Smokin', Backtracks, Past Times Behind, and a bunch more that you can find in the cassette bargin bin at K-Mart. This isn't to say the songs aren't good, but they certainly aren't new. Save your money and buy Really Smokin' or Backtracks."
2,Too Bad,"The Hall and Oates I remember from the 70's showed consistent brilliance and some genius as they gave us spot-on performances of well-written songs and tight arrangements. This new collection shows that they can still sing exceptionally well with perfect intonation and good phrasing. Unfortunately, the quality of the songwriting is mediocre and the production of this CD is abysmal. Apparently no corner was left uncut in the recording studio, if it was, in fact, recorded in a studio. ""Back in Love Again"", ""Past Times Behind"", ""Months Weeks Days"", and ""If That's What Makes You Happy"" sound as if they may have been recorded on a hundred dollar cassette deck in someone's basement. I wish there was highlight to this recording, but the best I can say is that ""Fall In Philadelphia"" isn't too bad. That I paid fourteen bucks and change for ""Pure Classics"" IS too bad."
1,Digital Audio does not work,"I bought these cables right before the Xbox 360 came out. Soon afterwards, I hooked it up and couldn't get the digital audio to work. The receiver noticed it was getting a signal, but apparently the cable was corrupting it. Don't waste the money on these. Spend the money on first party accessories."
2,This component video cable does NOT provide digital audio!,"This component video cable for the Xbox 360 does not provide digital audio. While it does have a hole/slot to plug an optical audio cable into, the slot does not work. I plugged an optical audio cable into the slot, and ran the other end to my digital audio/video receiver. Low and behold, NO digital audio! Do yourself a favor and buy another version of the cable (such as the Microsoft version) if you plan on using digital audio with your Xbox 360. When I used the MS version of the cable the digital audio works great! On a positive note, the component video for this cable does work if that's all you need."
3,Light my way,"The installation was so easy after I went to the web U Tub. After putting them in and making my way to work this morning at O dark thirty I noticed no discernible difference between these and the factory installed. My recommendation, don’t spend the extra money."
3,Too damn expensive!,"How is it that a book with 300 pages can cost $80? I see brand new books in book stores all around the US that cost no more than $30. I guess Ms. Scheetz, along with the publisher, know that college students will be required to use the book, so why the hell shouldn't they charge $80. Thanks for making my college years thin on cash!"
3,Not bad,"Would have like to have seen more photos in the book, but it was interesting to see how they set up some of the scenes. For a movie that was that heavy in CGI, would have like to have seen more ""tricks"" of how they did things.Not bad, though, if you can get it at a good price."
2,You've seen it all before but this time it's in French,It's nice to see French film makers shy away from the stereotypical love/drama fare and venture into horror. However despite its boldness I cannot recommend High Tension.This movie definitely pushes the envelope when it comes to gore and violence but the plot is predictable and the writing sloppy. The ending just doesn't make any sense and borrows heavily from other horror classics. I had the whole thing figured out half way through the movie.The theatrical release was plagued with partial (not to mention poorly executed) dubbing. One scene would be dubbed and the next would be subtitled. Hopefully the DVD fixes this and lets you enjoy the original soundtrack. That would be the only reason to purchase this movie.
3,High Tension,"Its a ok movie totally for being from France.Its really rare that any scarey/horror movies comes from there. But this one is really good made and it makes you really into the movie.Pretty wacho style hehe, lots of blood and gore!A movie that that any horror freeks must see./mireille"
3,"High Tension, Low Sense","As I was watching High Tension, I was captivated and really enjoying it, for the most part it is an effective, well-done and good-looking slasher flick. When it was done though, and I was checking out some of the DVD extras (making of, commentary by director etc), I realized the action was completely inplausible. That made me take my review down a notch to only 3 stars... the physical manifestations of the psychological elements to this never could have happened, period, which renders this really nothing more than a glorified cartoon. It's somewhat admirable in its homages to many other great films, and in a nutshell I'd say High Tension is ""The Machinist"" meets ""Jason""... but I'm not so sure those two could ever, or should ever, have met."
3,A great horror film but...,"This is a well-crafted French suspense, horror film with a strong female hero and all the blood and gore most horror fans would need. I enjoyed just about everything this film was doing until the end. Essentially a very promising film that had everything going for it until the writer settled on clique, tired plot elements to wrap the story up and cause the audience to lose just about all investment they had in the characters."
5,BRILLIANT,THE SCENE WHRE ALEX'S FATHER OPENS THE DOOR FOR THE SLASHER MAKES ME GLAD TO HAVE ACONCEALED WEAPONS LICENSE.
4,Decent!,"The plot is this simple....roommates go home to study/visit. There is a happy family that is excited that their daughter is home with a friend. There is a well loved cute little kid and a seemingly happily married couple. And there is a ""truck driving mad man"" who comes into the house and kills everyone, takes one roommate hostage with the other following to help with the big escape. There are several other murders and great chase scenes, and lots of twists and turns in this movie, but you should be able to guess the ending way before it happens. My only criticism is that I really didn't like the dubbing, at times it made the movie a little low budget and hokey. But if you like scary movies, you will enjoy it, you just have to ignore the dubbing!"
5,What is wrong with you people,"The next best thing to having your own head sliced off by a seventy pound sledge hammer is watching it on the big screen. Come on people, admit it already: there is a giant yellow stain beneath your couch where you pissed through the cushions.I didn't, only because of a rare urinary blockage from drinking too much pickle juice."
2,"Been there, done that.","High Tension takes imagery from the Texas Chainsaw series, I spit on your Grave, Last House on the Left and any other 1970's shocker one could think of. Which is all fine if one considers it an homage to the genre rather than a hack. Unfortunately, High Tension pretentioulsy tries to add intelligence and surprises were clearly any genre fan can not be surprised as the plot twists just seem all too familiar. My guess is that the film will gain popularity with younger generations (just as all the Rob Zombie flics do) that may or may not be familiar with all the horror goodies previous decades have given us. I also object to the gratutious use of lyrical rock music in moments when an ambient soundtrack would be more appropriate and powerful."
1,By the numbers slasher film with a nonsensical twist,"College girls Alex and Maria travel to a country cottage only to be stalked by a killer.Most of this film is a predictable horror flick with false alarms, bloody killings and narrow escapes. The usual cliches are in full force, phone lines are cut, the killer is everywhere, the pretty girls are screaming...In the final minutes a twist is added when we learn the killer's true identity. The only problem is twist makes no sense. It contradicts scenes we'd already seen and feels forced and just added in to make a cliched film seem more shocking.The photography is excellent, the directing fine, and while the girls don't have much to do other than look pretty and scream they do it well. But there's really nothing to recommend this disappointing film."
3,Not bad for blatant plagiarism...,"This movie was well-acted, interesting and relatively well-written. That being said, neither one of the director/writers, even amidst their self-laudatory and aggrandizing commentary, felt it was necessary to point out that the story is essentially identical to that written by Dean Koontz in his book (and subsequently made for T.V. movie) Intensity, circa 1995. For the record, I am not really much of a Koontz fan, but nevertheless it seems that credit should be given when it's due, and it seems no one involved in this film wants to acknowledge that with the exception of the last 10-15 minutes, this whole idea was stolen from someone else. Three or four stars for the movie, zero stars for integrity."
2,Could have been...,"To quote one of my personal faves (A Bronx Tale), ""The saddest thing in life is wasted talent"". Actually, no scratch that. It was not the ""talent"" that fell short in this film. More like a missed opportunity.I watched this movie knowing nothing about it except for the short description given by ""On Demand"". The movie steadily lives up to its namesake! I was like a clenched fist for about an hour of this movie, and then- ugh...The director just backed off! The whole plot ""twist"", and I say twist with irritated scorn. In reality the ending felt so trite, my first thought was ""...director must have altered the ending under pressure from the studio? distributor??? Huh? Did I really just waste an evening watching that?!"""
5,One of My Favorites!,"This movie is yet another example of why I have become a fan of French horror movies! High tension is one of the best horror films I've seen in modern times, it's refreshing, thrilling, captivating, and thoroughly entertaining. With that being said, I must mention that this is a psychological thriller, which may lead viewers to be disappointed by the end of this film. Typically I do despise psychological twists as well, but somehow I didn't mind it in this film because 1) I was expecting it because the film foreshadows it within the first 5 minutes of the film and 2) it still had a great storyline. I mean if you really hate the twist, then I suppose the viewer may resort to simply watching only the first hour and 10 minutes, which is when the ""bad guy"" is ""dead"". Overall, I would highly recommend this film to any horror fan!"
1,intense?,Wow someone spent way too much time on that review.You do need to get out more.The movie was a piece of eurotrash with nothing new to offer the viewer. Plain and simple. No need to read into it any further.I agree with the reviewer below. Don't waste your money unless you have no life or anything else to watch.Amanda
1,INTENSE???,This coming from a guy who reviewed THE WEDDING DATE!This movie blows I'm sure so does that reviewer.KAtie
1,Move on...,"Another perfectly, well done slasher movie, more horrifying than ever. If you get off on this kind of thing...enjoy. If you're not sure, then avoid it. You'll also avoid the subsequent horrifying dreams, imaginations, etc. There's enough need for this type of film like there's need for another Coke advertisement."
2,total Dean Kootz rip off! shame on you!,"Thank goodness I'm not the only one who saw this turkey for what it was, plagarism! The entire movie is Intensity by Dean Koontz until the ending which is total crap by the way. How can you just rip someone's book and not give them credit? I hope Mr. Koontz sues these people. If you want a real thrill read Mr. Koontz's book, and if you are not much of a reader, if you can find it, Fox made a tv movie on the book ,and gave Mr. Koontz credit, the tv movie was actually pretty good. Hope this helps."
4,"What a hoot! But, get the dubbed copy if you can.....","This movie is in french unless you get the dubbed copy. We watched it the first time without the dubbing, and it still was okay, as there isn't a whole lot of audio in it, but the dubbing makes it more enjoyable and seems to 'fit in' pretty well. Not like many of the Japanese dubbed movies of old. Even though you pretty much figure the movie out in the middle, it is still definitely worth the watch. It begins with two friends going to the home of one, to spend their vacation with family. The very first night all ---- breaks loose and the terror begins. I would not suggest young children watch it, as it could scare them with the obvious issue that there are people in the world who break into homes and murder people. This happens within the first few moments of the movie, but what happens after that is when the real suspense comes in. It's worth the fun of watching and is a little bit of a turn from the normal."
4,Uncertain,I bought this dvd as a gift for someone who specifically requested it. I have not yet heard back from her about it. Maybe she's watching it now.
2,This movie almost sucked,I saw this movie and thought it was boring. It just barely rates above sucking due to the fact that I have seen movies that were worse.
5,"WICKED, SICK, AWESOME MOVIE!!!","I picked up the unrated version of this movie the day it came out. I never seen it before, but heard it was well worth checking out. Let me tell you, if you love lot's of blood and gore in your horror films, then this is well worth checking out. I thought the movie was put together beautifuly. It is unlike anything I haver ever seen before. I don't mean just the blood and gore either, I mean the twist at the end of the movie. I will admit, I didn't get it at first, but I got it now. I won't say what it is because I don't want to give anything away. You will know what Im talking about if you view this film. I recommend checking it out at least once."
2,Chyna Sheperd untouched and alive?,"I thought the first hour or so was great, a great remakeof Intensity by Dean Koontz. Sort of like the way they updated The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Except the film makers decided by writing their own end to the story they could steal the rest from Koontz and try to pass theirs off as original. The whole story, up until after the gas station. was lifted. And my god the ending, their ending, sucks.The special features on the disc have both of the writers claiming that their story was original, that they came up with the idea while they were in high school. Makes sense because I believe Intensity hit the shelves at the same exact time these two thieves had their artistic premonition. I agree with the other review and the writers should be sued."
2,Are you kidding me?,"The movie was going really good. It was tense, exciting, nerve wracking....then the ending just ruined it all.Most of what you see in this film is just what the killer is imagining. I'd say only 15% of the movie actually happened. Everything else is just a dream. We don't figure this out until they reveal the ending.While this could work for most people, many of us have seen this same plot device used many times before in other movies or TV shows, so the idea is old and basically just ruins the film for me."
4,High Suspense,"Here's one that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and in constant suspense, until the very end. It starts off a bit slow, then gradually picks up. Almost worthy of Hitchcock."
1,i wanted to like it...but i couldn't,"The movie was going ok...then WHAM! the twist...I was shocked. then after about 5 seconds I realized half of the stuff the killer did were either unnecessary or impossible. It was a lazy film that really let me down. I love horror movies, I love sci-fi movies where you need to suspend disbelief. But I don't think I've ever been ask for such suspension of disbelief as much as this piece of crap.For all those who disagree...Explain the scene where the killer gets head for the head.P.S. Amazon really needs to let people rate things with zero stars."
3,"High Tension, maybe; lowlifes, definitely.",I was caught up in the plot but disappointed in the resolution. After a really great start the whole thing just becomes a statement about how selfishness triumphs in the end.
5,Good freakin movie i enjoyed it that whole time.,I really liked this movie it had action and drama in it. I recommend this movie to everyone. You will enjoy it. Relax and have dinner and then watch this movie.
3,French should leave the horror to the Asians,"It appears this horror/thriller flick is a fan favorite here. I gotta disagree. It had potential Ill give it that. Some parts were well done- sure. In fact it wasn't bad either. But the twist ending had me asking so many questions like ""how is that even possible"" . The ending ruined the realism which brings any horror movie to life. Just thinking this could totaly happen adds to the thrills."
2,Holes...,"The gore in this movie was impressive. However, that's where the greatness ends. There are so many holes in the plot that it appears that the writer just tacked on an ending, like ""hey, this might be neat"". There isn't much that leads up to the ending that could ever lead one to guess it. That's not in a good way either. There's a big difference between a surprise ending and an ending that just doesn't add up. One of many inconsistancies: if she wasn't in the car chasing the van, then she wasn't in the wreck that insued. If she wasn't in the wreck, then she wouldn't have any visible signs of being in a wreck. The plot could have been something great, if they would have followed through. But, it just wasn't."
2,Disappointing,"The movie was great until the last 15-20. I was feeling the high tension with every twist and turn the main character made, but the last 10 minutes which showed the other part of the movie being a hallucination was lame for lack of a better word. OK rental do not waste your money buying."
3,high tension,"Oh my God, can you say, ""rip off?!"" Has anyone seen the '97 movie, Intensity? Dean Koontz wrote the story-I think that it wasn't that popular movie, but it was fairly enjoyable. This movie followed it step-by-step-I knew what was coming before it happened! The only thing, Intensity didn't have the whole lesbian twist. I thought that it was worth watching, but it was predictable and totally cliche."
3,3 of 5,"The tension may be high if it's your first time watching and you don't know what's going to happen. Once you do, it all seeps out, never to return again, even if you watch it again. That means this is a movie you can enjoy either once or not at all. I enjoyed it once, despite the blatant implausibility of the plot. It's about two girls, Marie and Alex, visiting the home of Alice's family. They plan to stay for a few days, but it doesn't take long for all heck to break loose in the form of what is presumably the local serial killer arriving at their front porch in the dead of the night.marcellee.com"
3,Pretty Decent Movie,"One of the more violent movies I've seen. Not for the faint of heart...at all, really. In fact, if you have any aversion to blood, I'd recommend you steer clear of this movie."
4,Great Flick!,"In my own personal opinion this movie is great. Although there were some parts that you would think come on as far as maybe (noises), but for being a foreign film it caught me by suprise.There is nothing like a slasher murder movie with a twist. These days movies are too predictable. This one a little tiny bit predictable, but worth it in my book. Great directing, solid acting and the editing was even good for a French film."
2,Not totally original,"I was very excited to watch this movie and granted, its been probably at least four to five years since I watched it. I was let down totally because it looked like a very similar book I read. My favorite book of all time is Intensity by Dean Koontz. You can tell that the idea and story was all from the same but then certain things went in an opposite direction. I maybe be a little hard on it because of the fact it didn't do the actual novel justice what so ever, but if you want a better version of this movie, read the book Intensity because it is ten times better"
3,Good movie but the ending is lame..........,Its the end I don't get. Marie is the killer? Yet gets sucked off in a van by a head w/o a body? I don't get the ending at all? Its as if the ending belonged to another movie.
2,Decidedly average,"The best thing that happened in the movie was the unconventional ending. The gore - and I saw the uncut gore - wasn't all that gruesome, in my opinion. There were long stretches of time where nothing much happens - especially since the ""unconventional ending"" was explained in the very beginning of the film.Given the interesting ending, some explanation would have been nice other than another entry for The Celluloid Closet Part 2."
5,"""High Tension"" is scary!","""High Tension"" is scary! The directing by Alexandre Aja is excellent. The cast led by Cecile De France is excellent. An interesting story that frightens you at every pace."
1,"Stupid, Bloody, Stupid","This movie can't be as bad as I think it is. Or is it? Avoid the misery of finding out for yourself. High Tension is a one-gadget movie with plot holes large enough to drive a Home Depot truck loaded with chain saws through. The war in Vietnam did not have this much senseless violence. De France is quite attractive in her blood-spattered T-shirt but she'd be a lot more attractive if she spent a little less time sawing people's heads off, nailing their feet to the floor, and torturing them in various other ways. Not seeing this movie isn't good enough. You will never again be a whole person until you've forgotten that it exists."
2,Someone looking for a cheesy horror film,"I can understand people making the dumbest possible decisions in horror films, and I understand all the bloody gore. That is the whole point. Don't ruin the movie with a plot twist that makes no sense. There are too many problems with the twist that completely ruined the movie. Also, I don't know about the audio soundtrack. Half the movie was in French and half was in English for absolutely no logical reason. After the plot twist the movie takes a turn for hilarity. Hold on to your horses folks!Overall I much prefer ""Club Dread"". At least in that movie the killer that won't die continues chasing people even with is lower torso missing!"
1,Nothing is original,"DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! This is a total waste of time. Not only is the movie vile and unentertaining but it also lacks a story and is a rip in the side of many moviegoers. It is disgusting, stupid, filled with never ending brutal deaths that are pretty much obvious and lame. And the Twist at the end makes no sense whatsoever. Heed the warning. This movie is the worst movie ever made."
3,Ending Needs Work,"After seeing High Tension you start to think why people were making such a big deal about Hostel because this movie goes crazy with the gore. The film was going in a good direction until the amazing but horrible end. The ending is lazy and you'll see what I mean when you see it. Basically your being leaded to believe one thing and that belief is ripped right from under you when they switch everything up. They give the story away very obviously in the beginning and I think they thought nobody was going to notice it. I'll tell you what your basically getting in this film, your getting gore, not as much high tension as they say it will give you, and a half done story that definitely has been done before."
3,"Not the same as ""Intensity""","Alright, so I bought this movie since I heard that it was based off Dean Koontz's book Intensity. That book was awesome and kept me to the edge of my seat. Some reviews said this movie was exactly the same as the book except the very end. NOT true! I say it is very similar to the book only halfway...... and the twist at the very end wasn't good in my opinion. I wish the movie could have been deployed the same way the book was. I guess the book had too much detail and it was impossible to act all of it out. Anyways, I thought the movie would have been better if it was just straightforward without the twist in the end."
3,doesnt make sense........,"First of all, the movie is in French. You can decide between english subtitles or a version where they dub the voices (like in some asian movies where their mouth moves one way and they say somethin else). Hopefully that doesnt bother you. Well, the movie is good all the way until the end. Its bloody and suspenseful, but once you get to the end, its kinda dumb. It's a twist that doesnt make any sense. I bought the movie, hopin it would be good. Like i said, it is until the end. I wouldnt recommend buying this movie unless you wanna add to your collection."
5,HIGH TENSION LIVES UP TO THE NAME KEEPS ME IN HIGH TENSION!!!!!!!!,High Tension is a great horror foreign movie that really keeps you in tension the whole time!!!!!!! When two girls go over to her parents farm house in the countryside of France they are running for their lives from a mad killer that drives a old rusty truck!!!!!! This movie is like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre and little bit of Halloween rolled up into one!!!!!! Its worth renting and it will keep you in high tension from the beginning of the movie to the very last ending TRUST ME ON THAT!!!!!
3,Um okay?,"The film had plot holes. I had to question, ""So was this girl driving two cars or was it all played in her wack imagination?"" I had to watch a french film for Halloween. This one was a typical horror with ghetto gore and cheap scares. It had ""high tension"" through out the film but I recommened ""Les Yeux sans visage"" (eyes without a face) for a family horror film on Halloween."
3,The twist ruined it,"This is a great piece of horror, Alexandre Aja is a director to watch out for. If you take out the whole twist in the end this is a masterpiece of a horror movie. Its not only because the twist was unoriginal, its that the rest of the film was so good the twist ruined all of it. It barley made any sense at all and just turned the film into another cheesy horror movie, wich it is not. Anyway besides that I love this movie. The gore, cinematography were well done and the music is good too. Remove the whole twist in the end and I think you can call this a horror film as art."
5,Classic !!!! One Of The Best Films.,"I have only one Word, ""AMAZING"", is part of my colection. buy now."
3,It could have been a great film,"I am sorry to say that this started out being one of the best horror films that I have seen in a long time, until I got to the ending. The film would have been better if it had ended 10 minutes sooner. Why I ask myself, why would anyone destroy this film with such a half baked ending."
2,Could've been good,"The first three-quarters of this movie? Pretty good. Grim, claustrophobic, brutal, and gory: all the markings of a nasty horror picture, the sory we just don't get enough of these days. And while the dialogue wasn't Shakespeare, it was serviceable.Then we hit the last quarter, and everything falls apart. I haven't seen an ending this frustrating in a long time, and it ruins all the good stuff the preceeds it. This movie has been accused as ""homophobic"" by some, and that may be true; but far worse is that it's just plain stupid."
2,Enough with the plot twists,"I wanted to like this movie, but it failed me. First off the dvd has three versions: US, French and dubbed. The US is a mix of dubbing and subtitles. The French is subtitle (and the best) and the dubbed is horrendous.Now to the film itself. It's gritty and well done. The gore will keep you on the edge of your seat. All is well until the plot twist. This is where the film disappoints. Such a potential of a movie."
3,Haute Horror?,"Ahhh, the French. So much style over substance (Brotherhood of the Wolf, The Crimson Rivers). While the M. Night Shalamadingdong-like ending was unexpected for me, this beautifully done gore-fest was as predicatable as it was frustrating. My main issue with slasher movies is the sheer absurdity of the protagonists, as they make one ridiculous move after another, setting themselves up for death.Of course, with the ending, some of it made more sense. Some less.At least it was pretty."
3,Conflicted,"There is much about this movie that I liked: the ""high"" tension (indeed!), the blood, the characterization, the energy level, the creativity and the setting. I would hate to give too much away, but it was the ending of the film that didn't work for me. The twist came at the expense of logic and rationality. I felt it didn't work with what had come before, except an early premonition on the part of one character. That's a deliberately vague description because this is definitely a movie to experience for yourself. I would recommend it. I would just not recommend it highly."
3,Utterly Predictable,"I give High Tension 3 stars based solely on the fact that I have seen a lot worse as far as horror movies go. By no means, however, is this an endorsement of the movie. I had this movie figured out in under the first five minutes from something Marie's character says. I'm trying not to give it away too much, but it is extremely obvious. On principle, a movie that a person can figure out in that brief period of time is not good. I do feel that Cecile De France, who plays Marie, was entertaining to watch, and I hope she picks better projects in the future."
2,I seen worse,"I just watched this movie last night. I really had high expectations, even though it was a foreign film. It started out well, not the typical slasher movie. There was a lot of blood and guts as the movie progressed. I have to admit the ending was not at all what I expected. The movie leaves a lot to piece together in the end and It sort of leaves you scratching your head, and wondering how it all went together."
3,Really quite good. Until the end.,"I actually really liked this movie until they ruined it at the end. I won't ruin it for those of you who still wish to see it, but at the end you're gonna be pissed. And I highly recommend you watch it in subtitles. The voiceover isn't realistic enough and there is not the proper emotion in the right spots.Three quarters of this movie are actually pretty tense and scary. I was happy that I had actually discovered a movie produced AFTER the 1970's that was actually kinda scary. The special effects are pretty good and even the acting is OK for a horror movie.But then there is the ending, where you're left scratching your head in disbelief. The end invalidates everything else that happened in the rest of the movie and the 3/4 of the movie that WAS GOOD now makes no sense. Too bad, cuz it woulda been a good horror movie."
5,ONE OF THE BEST SCARES IN YEARS!,"First, I have seen most of the classic horror films and most of the garbage put out today...All I can say about High Tension is, it scared the hell out of me from start to finish and I loved every minute of it. I will soon be adding this one to my extensive horror film library.A tip for those of you who don't or may not really know how to properly watch a horror film: Create atmosphere; Turn off the lights; light a few candles; TURN UP THE VOLUME on your BIG SCREEN TV(hopefully you have a nice surround sound system too!..it really enhances the experience)...Put in High Tension and watch it with NO DISTRACTIONS...Try this and I think you too will be boasting that this one is...ONE OF THE BEST SCARY FILMS OF ALL OF TIME!"
3,"It was okay, but could have been something great.","I heard a lot of good things about this movie before I watched it. I was impressed by all the gore and I thought to myself that finally, in this genre, there was going to be an excellent movie. All the way up until the ending, I was really into it. The ending messes up the movie because things start making absolutely no sense. If they would have incorporated the ending into the movie where it would have made more sense, this movie would have been better than I thought it was. Another thing that took the viewing pleasure away from me was the poor dubbing. I would rather watch this in French with English subtitles, at least that way, it wouldn't be so annoying. Overall, I would say this is good for a rental. I have to say that I am slightly disappointed because this showed so much potential."
3,So Close And Then...,"This could have been one of the better horror/slasher flicks to come out in recent years. Not just based on its blood and guts, but more for its ability to make you scared of the human monster. Everything about this movie seems to fall into place. The timing is perfect, the story isnt too drawn out, the dialogue isnt forced. It was almost perfect, and then it happened. The dreaded twist ending. In this case you will either love it or hate it, but for me, it was the end. Somehow in the last 15 minutes the movie goes completely south. Whether its the silly ""twist"" ending that comes out of left field with absoultely no explanation at all. Or its sudden turn into the French version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This small section of movie really wrecks what was, in my opinion, one of the better and more realistic horror movies in a while. Be prepared to make a judgment call in the last 20 minutes."
3,"Texas Chainsaw Massacre, French-style...","When two college girls go to the country to study for their exams, they've no idea of the horror awaiting them there. Everything seems to be going ok until a mysterious stranger knocks on the door and starts killing members of the family in the most gruesome ways possible. One of the girls witnesses all of the brutal attacks but is powerless to stop the sadistic murderer, we don't find out why until later. Every action and dialogue is important so watch carefully. This film is not for the faint-hearted, but for those who can stomach it, it is a visual and horrific delight."
3,awesome till the twist ending,"This movie was sick, I think it was loosly based on intensity by dean koontz, it was soooooo similar. a wacky home invader slaughters a family with lots of suspense as a guest in the house manages to hide. lots of sick gory scenes, that should leave a really bad taste in your mouth. then the end happened with a twist and made the movie not make any sense. if the director just stuck to the Intensity based story of just a psyco murderer killing people the movie would be 5 stars. I havent read any other reviews but I'm positive that others must have felt the same the last 10 minutes destroyed this movie."
1,good movie until the twist,I totally agree with the last review. The plot of this movie is definitely taken from Dean Koontz's Intensity with the exception of the unbelievably stupid twist ending.If they would have stuck with the original ending then this movie would have been decent but the ending just makes no sense at all and just kills the whole movie.They made a movie from Koontz's original story that stars John C. McGinley (Dr. Cox on Scrubs) as the killer so if you want to see a good version of this story with a believable ending then watch it instead of this crap.
1,"The true translation should read ""Intensity Ripoff w/ Extra Blood""","Don't waste your time with this wretched mess.The formula, in summary, is this. (Galoises not included.) Steal Dean Koontz' 2000 book plot, add about vingt huit (28) buckets o' blood, conclude with a swiss-cheese ""twister"" ending."
1,For such a strong begining this ending kills the film,"An hour into this movie I was thinking ""this is one of the best slasher flicks I have ever seen."" True to the title I was on the edge of my seat in suspense of what would happen next.But the ending just falls apart. It is so bad it litterally negates the entire movie. I was left flat and some-what angry. What started out as a clever twist to a brutal gore fest, turned into what can only be described as a lack of a substantial ending so they ""made it work""... and it did not work!"
3,Write a book...,"I don't know why some reviewers need to repeat the entire script while reviewing these movies. I'm sorry, I didn't want to watch the damn movie!! I just wanted to read your stupid reviews instead. Get a BLANK (Amazon Censors) life!!! Either you like it or you don't..."
2,Some High Tension moments...,"After watching this movie, I can't say I would've called the movie ""High Tension"". Sure, there was some moments that raised the suspense somewhat, but it feels like the script writers and director were trying to deflect your attention from what is otherwise a weak story. I think most will probably figure out what's really going on within the first half hour of the film. I will say during the end of the movie, Cecile De France does put in a haunting performance. A missed opportunity overall in my book."
2,Does Dean Koontz know they ripped off his story?!,"I loved this movie, it was very gory and a fun more R-rated remake of Intensity....until I figured out the ending was different and it WASN'T a remake of Intensity at all AND the original creater of this great story, Dean Koontz, didn't even get credit for it! Within the first 10-15 mins, it is painfully obvious that this is a total remake of Intensity from the college friend visiting the friend's family to the guy showing up at night and killing them one by one to the friend hiding under the bed and making the room look like no one was using it to her sneaking into the truck, the daughter being the only one to live by capture, and on and on and on....for all but the last 15 mins of this movie it WAS Intensity. How disappointing that there was no credit given to Koontz...what a ripoff. A great movie that just left a bad taste in your mouth. PS Koontz, your ending was WAY better!"
4,twist ending could use some un-twisting,"Terrific horror flick. Well done all around--but I must say this: I hated the damn twist ending so much that I am tempted to reveal it! But I won't.Aja and his partner Levasseur are going places in this genre, no doubt about it. Only let us hope and pray that they stay clear of annoying twist endings in the future.Get the widescreen UNRATED VERSION if you can. Gore effects, by the way, are top notch. This is one suspenseful horror flick that will have you on the edge of your seat--that is, up until around the twist--and then you'll go: What? No way!(And you'll say a few other things that I can't print here.)I suppose mainstream audiances may not be bothered by it as much, although the true horror fan will be ticked off plenty. Still worth getting."
4,Wow!,"I haven't been this disturbed watching a movie in quite some time. Intense is the key word to describe this film. The music, the long pauses without dialogue and sheer brutality keep you on the edge of your seat. The performances were solid and look of this film was very 1970's.Please watch this movie with subtitles because the dubbed version is rubbish. The extras are good, they give a lot of info about the movie and the people who made it.Highly recommended."
1,CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am a big fan of horror flicks, but this is one of the worst pieces of crap that I have ever seen!!!...Don't let the other reviews fool you---AVOID this flick at all costs!...To say the dubbing and language problems this movie has, is to put it lightly!....A TOTAL waste of money!...About as scary as ""Mary Poppins...LOL!!""....It's your money folks, waste it if you want, not even worth a rental!!!!!!....Lions Gate should be ashamed!....I gave it to my 12 year old cousin, and he just laughed at it!!!.....AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!....You've been warned!"
1,"Everybody let's twist again, just like we did last summer. Everybody let's twist again, just like we did last year","Do you remember when, we did the twist last summer? Do you remember when, we did the twist last year?The twist in this movie, as has been copiously mentioned, stupefies an already stupid audience even further. And if you think such a thing cannot be done, let me assure you, You can ape the ape. I know about that.SpoilersSo the upshot is the girl with the Cesar hairdo who was fudding herself stupid was actually at the same time breaking into the house in the form of a demented orange farmer. She then... ah what's the use."
5,GUESS WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Guess what, this movie regard a girl with a psychological alter ego. Yeah, it's been done. Hide n' seek sucked, secret window was pretty good, FIGHT CLUB was excellent. Those had a narritive logic(somewhat). This one seems kind of absurd at its conclusion(especially how the girl survives being brutally torn apart by a weapon). However, if you try to make it have sense, it will. Perhaps she was hiding from herself, and was having a sort of neurotic war with herself, whether or not to kill, and fighting against herself. As we see through the top-notch and thoroughly beautiful gore effects, her brutality prevails(her id, of course)."
4,"Wow, gore galore!","Though I wouldn't put this movie into the stack of being ""intense"" is does provide the viewer with a much gore filled ride then anything out in the theaters right now.True the movie doesn't apply anything new to the genre and yes the pleasure scene was great to watch, but it does stand alone by projecting it to the viewer from the killers stand point.Though I wouldn't invest my time watching it 4 times let alone twice in the theater, it might make a good rental or add on to your collection.The gore was nice, but if you are looking for something with more substance, look somewhere else."
3,Lots of action,"This movie had me going right away. It was not what i expected,had lots of twists and i would watch it again."
4,"Surprised me, which doesn't happen often!","This was definitely filled with tension. The English dubbing wasn't the best, but the movie kept us on the edge of our seats until the very end."
1,"PC app: poor, PDA app:fair","I have to agree with the previous reviews. The PC app is difficult to use, does not employ a standard UI, and makes bulk loading of map data to the PDA normal memory, much less extended memory, as tedious as you can get. I would throw the app out, and start from scratch. On the PDA side, there is no overview map that i could find. You could only access maps by name which is not WYSIWYG at all. It does scroll fast and the maps look great, however. I'm suprised at the total lack of basic necessary features. Delorme could learn a great deal just by looking at Garmin's Mapsource applications and their very well designed cartographic GPS units. Until they address the ability to quilt together map sections, provide bulk downloading, and many other features, i'd wait on this one."
1,Not User Friendly,"I have used the regular PC Versions of Street Atlas for years and love it. This software for a PDA need to be pulled from the market by Delorm before it gives all their software a bad name. They are trying to load too much secondary travel info into the PDA and not what is really needed. Which is easy to use maps or areas that can be easly loaded and navigated. Something like their Street Atlas for PC's Ver. 01. Who needs the names of hotels, places of interest, and eating establishments on a PDA. All you want to do is find out where you are and where you are going."
2,Boring read.,I found it odd that this book was written by someone who actually has children. I am childfree and am very content being this way. This book deals with all different reasons for being childless/free. I thought this book was horrible. It dealt too much with theories and not real life situations. Only one chapter was dedicated to those who choose not to have children. Big disappointment.
1,What is the point?,"I read this book, only because a newspaper reviewer mentioned it. He quoted only the comments from people who chose to be child free. I expected some story sharing from these people about how good and uncomplicated their lives are.This book is awfully slow reading. Several times I would take a deep breath and force myself to finish it.Still have no clue as to what the woman was trying to say."
3,Attention Wharton-alholics,"Once you've read all of the ""A-list"" Wharton novels several times over, it's a treat to tread on new ground. This isn't the best of La Wharton, but it's still the Maitresse, and she sure knows how to string a sentence together. If you haven't read any of her major novels, go order The House of Mirth or The Age of Innocence. But if you've been around the Wharton block a couple of times, order this one for an infusion of new blood."
1,Waste of money and time,"Even as a new developer this book did not do anything to enhance my understanding of Notes Development. If the authors had included development tips or design topics it might be worth the money. But, it read like an over-worded marketing piece created to convince someone to use Notes!"
1,This book is poor...,"Even if this book did apply to the current version of Notes, it still does not really show you how to put together the application or any ""unseen"" things. This book, for lack of a better word, stinks. Also, if you want to do anything with the Web, it doesn't cover that either. Don't buy this book."
2,A high-level discussion only,"I was given this book by a friend; I was thankful that I did not purchase it myself. It is a high level, very brief summary of the types of applications for which Notes can be used.There is no outline of the process; just a discussion of a problem and here's the Notes database to use. Even an outline would have been helpful.A good idea of a book (hence a 2-star review); but lacking in all aspects."
2,Not her best book,"Carolyn Ambuter is fun! Creative! Er...this book? Not so much. Stitch books from the 1970's either aged well or they didn't. This one didn't. But see her other books which are really outstanding:Complete book of needlepointCarolyn Ambuter's Even More Complete Book of NeedlepointOpen Canvas, Instructional Encyclopedia of Open Work Techniques, Includes, Pulled Canvas, Needleweaving, Hemstitching, Filet, Hardanger, Reticello & Hedebo"
1,Cheap...,"Don't bite on the MAGLITE name, go to Walmart and buy any light with 100 lumens or more. You will be happier.."
4,Great Book,"This book has opened my eyes to the great original stories of many disney 'classics'. I was happy to get a bit of insight into the lives of the authors before reading their actual stories. This is an eye-opening book for anyone who is fed up with disney happy endings and would like to know the real, romantic stories which were turned into amateur slime by Disney..."
5,A must for any library,"I actually took Professor Griffith's course in Children's Literature. It was clear, insightful, and untroubled by deep and forcefully twisted interpretations of stories that were always meant to do one thing - entertain. This is a great collection for an adult to have - many of the ""original,"" or at least more primitive, forms of now-Disney-fied stories are a little too dark for children to bear. The introductions to each author (the book is categorized by author) are, again, short and insightful, and the rest of the book is just good old fashioned story telling."
5,ESSENTIA|L,An incredibly interesting and informative wee book which has yet to be surpassed. Every rider should have one.
5,Chris Farley is a favorite,My family and I watched this DVD and passed it around so much that it got lost. So many good laughs together from this collection - I had to get it again!
5,The Best of SNL period,"This is the best SNL special I have seen. Everyone I have shown it to has loved it too. Chris Farley is hilarious. All the best skits are here including, Matt Foley, Chipendales dancer, and many, many, more. You don't stop laughing while watching this video. There is no way you won't enjoy it."
2,nice look but hard to read,Very nice looking watch. Like the style but when I put it on with the light reflecting off the watch face it was very hard to read.Had to return and exchange for a different style.
3,"HALF CHILD, HALF GIRL, ALL WOMAN","Christine (Alisha Fontaine)is a country girl who moves to the city when her father dies and leaves her in debt. She manages to find employment as a topless dancer. Attempting to leave town she meets a gypsy woman who gives her a potion that cause her to believe she is working in a brothel about 100 years earlier. Here she meets the same people she already knows, but by different names. The older era is seen as a dream like state as the placed some Vaseline around the edges of the camera while filming most of the scenes.The acting was B grade, as was the plot. This is a first feature drive-in movie film. What I didn't like was the narration during much of the film attempting to show off the lack of creative talent the writers possessed.F-bomb, sex, nudity, girl/girl scene,"
2,"Lots of Promise, But No Delivery","Ripe you thing avoids ""a fate worse than death"" in the present and the past. Low budget attempt to recreate New Orleans at the turn of the 20th century is slow and predictable. Don't waste your time."
4,The best rap comes from memphis,"Id recomend this album to anyone who likes to cruise around bumpin it in there car this albums pure dope especialy tracks 2,3,10 and 13."
4,How to get No from Go,"Rbt D. Rutherford, Ph.D., presents clear-cut, proven methods for negotiating winning agreements, no matter how challenging the situation.Drawing on three decades of experience teaching, negotiating professionally writing, and speaking to thousands of men and women worldwide, Dr. Rutherford has taken the best of these experiences and has combined them with wisdom, humor, and his own insights to create delightfully pressented, readily understandable advice on dealing successfully with anyone.........."
3,Talk Memphis to Me,"I bought this for the ""Talk Memphis to Me"" song. If you're looking for it to sound like what she sang on her Cybill show you will be disappointed. It's still a good song but doesn't sound like the accoustic version on the show. There are a few other pretty good songs. She has an ok voice. I'm not sorry I bought it."
4,Hearing is beliving and so is seeing!!!!,"Having been lucky enough to see Ms. Shepherd in person at the Rainbow and Stars in New York City and to hear her voice I have to say that her CD Talk Memphis To Me is a great. She has the range and ability to sing a wide avenue of songs. It can be country or rock or blues, she can do it.I have this CD in my truck and listen to it when I want to relax, her other CD's are also worth getting.She is a pleasure to look at and listen to it.Buy this CD you will not be unhappy."
5,Beyond Great!,"Finally! A book that does not insult the ""worker in the trenches""! ""Beyond Spin"" takes the unbelievable position that cubicle dwellers have known all along-the spin upper level management tries to put on its mistakes has never fooled anyone. Truthfulness in corporate communication shows respect and trust (thus fostering its continuance) between the corporation and its employees. Kudos to the authors for their integrity and excellent writing!"
1,don't bother,"This book still exists? Save your money, its justmore corporate blah, blah, blah by three people who claim to have changed the face of corporate journalism by building an intranet that supposedly changed a company. Nothing more than a bunch of back-patting by three people who did nothing but spend 6-12 mo. in 'employee communications' positions within SGI working with an intranet that was conceived and built way before they took over.All three of them were escorted to the door because the company realized their ROI was zero. Too bad Markos, Drew and Kim...you couldn't get out of the way of your own 'spin.'"
4,"Not as jangly as ""Translate Slowly"", but equally unique","1991's ""Pop Beloved"" was released at what was the end of the jangle pop era, when most artists who performed the genre were either calling it quits or switching over to other forms of music (grunge, alternative, ect). ""Pop Beloved"" delivers the same harmonies from previous albums, but fails the recapture the sound of jangle pop. Shortly after this album, lead singer Croslin formed the group ""Spoon""."
2,not what I expected...,"To be fair about this review, the product description does not state what size the pops are. I expected these to be the 2 oz size but what I received were the .7 size. Had I known they were not the right size, I would not have bought them. I feel cheated and disappointed. Sure I love these pops. I grew up enjoying them and still do enjoy them. I never saw the small ones so I didn't even know they came in a smaller size. I hope others will learn from my mistake and maybe the seller will fix the product description. I bought these as a gift to my daughter as she loves them, too, but she has never had the smaller size either so I'm going to have to buy another box."
4,Revitalizes an old relationship,"""Getting the Sex"" is a great book that you can pick, find what you're looking for, and put down. The author's give a comprehensive understanding of the woman's psyche, but its also a great resource for men to get a better understanding of their partner. Put it on your bedside table - it can lead to a richer dialogue between partners and ultimately a closer relationship."
1,Nothing New,this book provides no new information. It's riding on the heels of other books detailing the complex nature of female sexuality and response. Do yourself a favor and save your money. You'd learn more reading the cover stories of NY Times Magazine and Newsweek that dealt with all this material a year or two ago.
1,doesnt function well,"The program has a hard time recognizing newer versions of Quicktime, saying you don't have it on your computer. I have used the program before years ago and if you have a working copy it has a lot of good recipes and other organizational features on it for shopping lists and menu planning."
2,Meh,"If you want to know about the ingredients and history of food throughout the regions of America, this is a pretty good book. As a recipe book, however, it fails quite horribly. When using this text in class, amounts of ingredients had to be vastly adjusted; more often than not, I just found different recipes of the dish online because I couldn't trust any of the ones in there.That being said, there are a few gems contained in it's pages. The bread pudding with whiskey sauce and banana pudding recipes are fantastic, as well as the kahlua pig recipe from the Hawaiian chapter.Good as a reference book, not so much as a recipe book, so be warned."
2,Awful,"This was one of my text books in culinary school and I have to say that it is the worst written book I have ever come across.There is alot of useful information within that describes in detail the ingredients used in various parts of the country but if you are using it for the recipes, beware because there are numerous mistakes. If you can get it used, it can serve as a good reference book but that's about it."
2,What a frustrating book,"We use this book in my American Regional Cuisine class. I get so frustrated working with this book, and I'm still not sure why the Chef uses it, because he gets frustrated, too. The recipe layout conventions vary from recipe to recipe, almost like several different people wrote them (which they did, but consistency is key! Especially if you intend your book to be used as a textbook)! Often, I find myself asking Chef, ""Why did the author do this?"" or ""Why wouldn't the author do this other technique?"" Chef often disagrees with the recipes listed in the book, or straight out tells us not to use them, or modify them.I do, however, give 2 stars. The history of each region is well laid-out, flows well, and is interesting. The book is well written, except for the recipes."
3,American Regional Cuisine,Dated material.Useful information.Can use information as base and decontruct or put a modern spin presentation and menu.
1,expediency,it has been about 3 weeks since my order and I still have yet to recieve it. My classes have started and I do not have my book.
2,"Not so great, not focussed in it's presentation","I bought this book, along with the Cliffs and the Boosalis How to Beat the CSET books. I read this book after reading the Cliffs book and I felt like the material that was presented was not well organized or focussed on key concepts that could stick in your head. The Art and Human Development sections were fine. I just stopped reading this book after a few pages into the History section, because too many details were listed without any focus on the important things. There were no tables (like Boosalis book) or outlines (Cliffs) to give a good overview of main concepts. The sample tests in this book were pretty stupid. I just felt like the questions they asked were not realistic. I found that they were very different in nature than the real test, the sample test online at the CSET website, or in the Cliffs book. Don't bother with this one in my opinion."
4,it helped me,i only used this book for the cset and i passes all sections on the first try. i did find some errors in the math section but other than that this book was great.
5,Seven Men fron Now 1956 ( Special Collector's Edition,"The hunt is on for seven men . Seven murderous rogues who robbed a Wells Fargo freight station of 20.000 USD , killing a clerk in the process . Ex lawman Ben Stride: Randolph Scott (1898-1987 ) is the man determined to track down those seven men , for it was his beloved wife who was murdered during the heist .During his encounters a struggling , California-bound pioneering couple Walther Reed (1916-2001) and Gail Russell (1924-1961) as well as an old nemesis , Masters : Lee Marvin (1924-1987) with who stride shares an uneasly alliance . All will find themselfs swept into the drama of strid?s search for justice . Gun Blaze and desceptiona abound in his rugged drama , with Scott perfectly cast as the stoic , No-nonsense Western hero . A super Western movie . Hight Quality transfer . Recommended"
3,Satisfying classic western.,"This 1950's classic western stars an aging Randoph Scott as the avenging ex-sheriff and a full-of-beans Lee Marvin as one of the bad guys. The typical 1950's theme of the tenderfoot being rescued by the seasoned gunfighter is portrayed once again--it must have appealed to the zeitgeist of the time.Despite wrinkles and a slightly stiff gait, Scott manages to exude the charisma which he is famous for. The wife of the tenderfoot, who is intruiged by Scott's charisma, is played by the gorgeous Gail Russell. Lee Marvin is excellent as the smirking criminal who lurks around wanting to make time with the tenderfoot's wife and receives a well deserved punch in the jaw from Scott.Overall a satisfying classic western."
3,If You Think This One Is Good . . .,". . . you should definately try to see ""The Tall-T"" and ""Ride Lonesome"" each of which is another Renown Western directed by Budd Boetticher, written by Burt Kennedy and starring Randolph Scott. As good as ""Seven Men From Now"" is, in my opinion ""The Tall-T"" and ""Ride Lonesome"" are better. Richard Boone, Lee Van Clef, Pernell Roberts, James Coburn (his first movie), etc., etc."
1,I FEEL CHEATED!,After I made the purchase I found out that I could not watch it online or on my TIVO like the website stated. I FEEL CHEATED!
3,A mini-classic,"Unlike some others, kept my interest all the way through. Fairly adult, some originality, and some nice cinematography. Tale a little too simple. Glad I got it. Glad I watched it. But probably won't watch it again for quite some time, maybe never."
1,Not the best,I gave this DVD to the local library after I watched it. It is not the best western I've ever seen by a long shot. I love Lee Marvin but even he is pretty bad is this boring oater.Save your money.
5,When Do we Get To See The Other Scott/Boetticher Classics?,"Yes, this is a great film. Great Scott, great Boetticher, great Kennedy, great Marvin. But where are the other Ranown masterpieces? How long do we have to wait for THE TALL T, RIDE LONESOME and COMANCHE STATION? I'm beginning to doubt we will ever see them on DVD in Technicolour and Cinemascope. My VHS tapes are all but worn out. Does anyone out there know what Columbia is up to? Are these wonderful films tied up in some legal wrangle? Plenty of inferior Scott oaters are being pushed out on DVD, why not the best work of his career? I'm tired of waiting, aren't you?"
3,Seven Men From Now - Randolph Scott,"This film on DVD contains a rather predictable plot and has no surprises in it, but the plot is okay. Every Randolph Scott fan should watch it and decide for himself."
5,IF YOU WANT A GREAT WESTERN. . .,"This movie isn't as well known as the Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns, or the John Wayne films, or the newer classics such as Silverado, Tombstone, or Open Range, but is is every bit as exciting. The story is a great one, portrayed by an outstanding cast of actors and seemingly much more realistic than many other westerns. It is a different kind of story told with passion and intensity with many of the classic and necessary elements essential to a great western film. If you are a fan of great westerns and have not yet seen Seven Men From Now, YOU NEED TO OWN IT AND ADD IT TO YOUR LIST OF ALL TIME GREATS!"
4,What a great movie.,"Randolph Scott played a terrific strong and silent type hero, but Lee Marvin realy made the movie.Now that it's mine, I can watch it when the mood hits me!"
5,7 Men From Now,Another great western with notable associate actors and actress'. The story thread is excellent as is most of these type of movies.
4,New Vice,Good movie......but if u want the old vice this is nothing like it. Acting and scenery were good. Had all the nice toys like the old series.
3,"Gritty Vice, with a bad guy you loved to see die","The cops are hard core, they strut through the entire film. For better or worse. I was drawn to this film by its director, Mann. It also seemed visually impressive. It was, don't get me wrong.Especially in those Miami night settings, with all those photogenic neon lights. the story, well, got you through. The kill scenes were a must see, and well, for 9 bucks, I don't know. Maybe not worth it. Just my opinion. BUt what is worth that price?"
2,Pretty Boring really,"Actually this movie had a lot of potential, unfortunately it didn't use it, it was boring, even the few action scenes were bland, yes they were realistic but that makes for bad TV. The plot jumped around a bit and there were many parts that didn't fit or just were not needed and ran on too long, not to mention there were parts where the sound was missing, yes I am sure it was for artistic reasons but when a man gets hit by a semi believe me it is not quiet, to me it just made the film seem amatuer and unfinished. Long sequences of nothing and too much focus on mundane subplots just made that film a waste of 2.25 hours of my life, I actually caught myself nodding off here and there, not to mention for cops trying to put a drug cartel behind bars they killed anyone who could have testified against the kingpins so THAT made it very unrealistic, there was no attempt to arrest anyone, just kill em all... pitiful."
2,Not that good,"Thius is not that good. I will, tend to agree with the bad reviews overall. It is an adaptation of the seies but which completely changes the style of its concept. While that is OK and probably more adapted to the times, the movie is still unfocused. The storyline is not that great and it combines a slow-moving pace with periods where nothing happens with moments of hard violence. It is also very very darkly shot and while I am sure this was intentional, it was not a good idea. And the acting is not that great."
2,What a waste,"I have to laugh at these 4 and 5 star reviews that look like they were written to promote the film, instead of an honest opinion. First, this movie should have never been called Miami Vice. It is an insult to a great 80's TV series, that rivited people to there TV sets on Friday nights. What we have here is a 175 million dollar movie that looks like it was shot using cheap video cameras by amatures, and a story that was thrown together.Mann should have taken Jamie Fox advice when he presented the idea to him to make a ""remake"" of Miami Vice. Not a film that just uses the name. I cannot begin to explane my disapointment in this film, and how bad it looks. I only gave the film two stars because of the action shoot out scenes which Mann is able to do very well. If there is a Miami Vice II movie, which I dought there will be, lets hope it's done right."
2,Michael Mann lover left disappointed,"I am not afraid of movie violence, drugs, or anything like that. I am a huge fan of Michael Mann's work. I thought Collateral was fantastic and Heat is easily in my top 5 of all time.I was excited to see Miami Vice, but after viewing I was left feeling overall disappointment. It lacked the development and human element that made his previous efforts great--I just didn't care what happened to anyone in the whole movie.Michael Mann is known for creating stark backdrops, but his vision of Miami is just plain cold, without feeling ""gritty"" as it was no doubt intended to.Overall the whole effort felt detatched and sterile, even the performance of the normally vibrant Jamie Foxx. Here's hoping Mann's next effort has a little more life in it."
2,"Don,t waste your money(wait for the re-edited DVD)","I am a huge fan of Mann,s work but in my opinion this one is his worst.Great locations,stylishly photographed,fine music but there is no story to follow here.It is overlong by the way.Watch the series instead.There is no way to care about the characters.OK performances(I mean just suitable).There is a rumor that the director will re edit this mega disapponting experience so I think we shall wait for the reduxed movie maybe it will be better SOMEDAY SOMEHOW."
2,Watch Heat Instead,"There were a couple of good action scenes, but that's about all that I enjoyed. I am a fan of Mann's films, but Miami Vice just didn't do anything for me. I actually dozed off a couple of times, which I have never done before in a movie theater. That should tell you something."
2,Not What I Expected...,"I think I saw this during summer break, and it was extremely boring! There were a few action scenes, but I remember falling asleep a few times! There was a nice little sex scene. I would not recommend MIAMI VICE!!!"
1,Suck isn't a big enough word,"In the classic John Candy/Steve Martin flick ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"", John Candy's character says ""Love isn't a big enough word"" to describe how he feels about his late wife.Well ""SUCK"" ain't a big enough word to describe this gawdawful bomb from hell."
2,Miami Vice 2006,"I went first day and there were a lot of older vice fans like myself.This was just like an episode, but yet, not the ""old vice"" we all wanted.I am sure younger crowd loved it, but it was not Sonny and Rico.I will probably buy it when it comes out, just because I love Vice old and new.I have everything else, why not this too?"
1,Sound Issues on HD,"At several points in the movie the sound cut out for a few minutes. It didn't matter whether I was on the stereo channel or 5.1, it just had no audio track. Also the HD had issues in places and the screen glitched a lot. I love the movie, but I'm a bit upset that there is no way to contact Amazon customer service regarding issues with the streaming video. The support portal is still geared for physical products. For 3.99 I'd expect a better streaming experience and or a way to contact Amazon for support."
2,Maybe the director was trying to do the Cops TV Feel,This review is mainly about the quality of this blu ray. Too bad no remastering was done to the video for blu ray. Just like some of the reviews there are scenes on this Blu Ray release that have too much grain. Could not believe the Blu Ray case has Hi Def experience listed on the insert. I thought I was watching an upscaled DVD of the movie. On some of the night shots there is so much present of grain the picture looks very bad and unwatchable. Just be warned before you buy.
4,Even Better the Second Time Around,"I saw this film in the theater b/c I was intrigued, and I found it dense, immersive and compelling.The second time, aspects of directorial and acting genius emerged.Great, great film. Most don't get it? Fine; most think that PEter Jackson's bastardization of Tolkien was a representation of the Lord fo the Rings because there were cool special effects.What makes a film is not effects, as Miami Vice demonstrates; what makes a film is characterization, and well-drawn plot.This film is dense with all of that. You'd have to wake up out of your consumerist coma to know it."
1,Don't waste your time on this one,"Miami Vice features endless shots of speedboats going to and fro, lots of unintelligible mumbled dialogue, and a lame drug-kingpin plot we've all seen a million times.It also features 2 partners, Crockett and Tubbs, who have absolutely zero chemistry with each other. If you hadn't seen the tv show you'd assume this was their first day on the job together.I am a fan of Michael Mann and I also loved the original TV series, but this film is a snoozefest."
1,One of the BAD action movies of 2006,"It has lots of big logical holes. For example in one scene, Colin Farrel and Jamie Foxx were searched by bodyguards of the gang leader. Yet, a couple of minutes later, Colin was able to threaten the leader with a grenade in his hand! How could he hide it from the bodyguard? It's impossible.There's no chemical between Colin and Li Gong. Their sex scenes are emotionless.I never cared for any characters from the begininng to the end. The action scenes were boring.This is a good example of a bad movie that was made of a lousy script plus good actors and actress."
2,On and on and on...,"Boring film.What's cool about it? Some boats and planes and cars a fancy condo. A couple decent gory ""deals gone wrong"" shots.What not cool about it? Everything else! This film (at two hours and twenty minutes) just spends too much time trying too hard to be ""cool"". Gratuitous sex scenes...club scenes...back and forth with the ""I don't trust them"" dialog. So much boring dialog. So much of nothing. They may as well have put their bathroom breaks in there too. It's just too much.The HD DVD presentation isn't too impressive either. I don't know if it was how it looks on film too or just on this transfer, but the picture is very unexciting. I've only read about the bonus features, which sound cool from what I've read, but I never count those myself.I just can't recommend this film. If it were an hour and a half maybe. It just doesn't move fast enough. Total snooze."
2,Goes down hill and than picks up at the end,"This movie was ok at the beginning but than it just got boring and the story became confusing and hard to follow. There was also very little action in it and it was just boring. The ending was good but that still doesn't make it worth it. I recommend buying the Miami Vice seasons on DVD or the PSP game. If your a die hard fan, well than go for it."
1,Horrible Waste of Time!,"Why was this movie called Miami Vice and ""loosely"" based on the tv series? Other than the names of the characters and the fact that they're cops, there was no resemblance at all to the beloved show. The plot was slow and hard to follow, the scenes were mainly dark and it was hard to tell who was where and doing what. I finally had to adjust the contrast on the tv so that everything was a weird color but I could finally tell what was going on. There were a few action scenes but they came so late in the movie that I didn't really care at that point if the main characters lived or died.I guess I'll have to get out my copy of Bad Boys if I want to see an action movie that has great chemistry between the actors. Colin Farell and Jamie Foxx's characters fell well short of the mark."
2,I wish I could get those two hours of my life back,"The movie Miami Vice may be great for fans of the series, but I wasn't one when I went into it. I like action films. I like Colin Farrell. I thought, why not? The answer: many many reasons. #1) Colin Farrell has a mullet and a Burt Reynold's style moustache that is so distracting I spent so much time lamenting its presence, I had a hard time grounding myself in the movie. #2) There is no way of grounding yourself in a movie that's about nothing. And it is. About nothing. No point. No plot. Just guns, nonexistent drug shipments, and bad accents. Lovely. #3) The movie didn't so much end as just cut off without any resolution.Can I please just have those two hours of my life back? Please, save yourself the time and money of renting this lackluster film."
1,Zero,This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen. Reasons why: It just starts. No title. No actor names on the bottom. The lighting is too dark in the film. You can never see anyone in any scene. Colin's gritty voice is horrible. Colin and Gong Li have no chemistry and I do not understand why they had so many scenes together. Gong's accent is horrible. I can never understand what she's saying. The dialouge is horrible. There is a part in the movie where I am sure Jamie was supposed to say FEDS but he says FEEDS. I could go on and on but I don't want to.
1,Just boring...,"Ok, so I've seen a bunch of folks talking about how there was no chemistry between the main characters - yeah that was a problem, but my biggest problem was there was no tension *anywhere*!After being undercover a grueling two days, Tubbs turns to Crockett and says something to the effect of ""Can you handle it, or have you been in too long?"" OH COME ON!!!If Isabella and Jesus have a poly or open relationship - which they certainly seem too, then why would Jesus be so upset to see her dancing with Crockett. You can't have that both ways.I honestly think they bought the MV title so they didn't have to spend anytime giving us background on the main characters - but they didn't use that extra time to give us any depth.I don't follow directors, I have no idea if this is a typical Mann movie or not - but it's a bad movie, and boring, and I want my $8 back! Sigh"
3,just ok,this movie was not related to the old Miami Vice in any way.. they should have changed all the name and ran as new cops..not use the original names of sunny and tubbs..because they did the original characters no justice at all.. Collin was not even close to sunny... very weak.. but show was ok to watch
1,Does not play.,Region 2 encoding: Will not play on most of the devices sold in the US or Canada [Region 1]. This item requires a region specific or multi-region player and compatible TV.
4,Very good action movie,This is a very good action movie. Sometime the story seems too impossible. However still entertaining and enjoyable and recommended.
3,Disappointed,I love MIami Vice the old one tho...this was a very weak movie they didn't even fully explore the beauty of Miami ;/
2,Great film; poor Blu-Ray,"Miami Vice is a great police drama. Unfortunately, the video quality of the Blu-Ray leaves much to be desired. Reviews on DVD Talk and other forums mention the presence of film ""grain"" during the darker scenes (night scenes etc.). Unfortunately, large portions of the film are ""dark scenes"". At it's worst, the video is simply unwatchable. I also own the DVD, and I find the DVD to be a more satisfying home movie experience. That aside, there are segments of the film which are free from the grainy background noise. These scenes offer a sharp picture with vivid color rendering. Too bad this doesn't hold true for the whole feature. The audio quality is about what you would expect from a Blu-Ray. Miami Vice is a great movie, but you should buy the DVD."
3,Great Entertainment.,"The film's lines are well written. The cinematography is excellent and some of Michael Mann's best. The storyline, however, especially in the first 45 minutes is extremely slow and almost unbearable as you wait for something, anything to happen. Therefore I take off one star. The actors do an excellent job. All of them do. There are a few scenes of gratuitous nudity, which I take off one star for."
5,Gets better with each viewing...,"As a fan of the original Miami Vice, and having grown up in Miami, I was somewhat leary of the ""movie"". After watching it for the first time, I found myself disappointed. I believe it was that it was nothing like the original show, and that was what I had come to expect, as most fans of a TV series would like.But, as a true lover of all movies, I watched the movie again, and then again and again. I can now say after months and months and about 10-15 viewings, I have thoroughly grown to love this movie. It stands on its own, as if the show had never existed - a 'different' version if you will. The story line is fairly good, the cinematography excellent, I feel the acting was respectable, and the music is incredibly perfect and in the end makes the movie (great soundtrack).If you didn't like this movie, I'd suggest giving it another view and you may find to enjoy it as I did. It now resides in my permanent HD-DVD collection, and how great it is to watch in 1080p."
1,The book is better,"Yes, I know there wasn't a book, and that's my point. Even worse, this movie was based on a TV show and the TV show is much better! The TV series had a sexy style, color, music, and a pulsating rhythm under the surface holding it all together. This movie, even with all its sexy actors and big screen, couldn't hold a candle to it. The script and the plot, even the scene changes, were disjointed. The dialogue was juvenile, the characters predictable and stereotypical. I couldn't even enjoy this as an action film. And don't get me started on the lame romance which took up a major portion of the story. Come to think of it, maybe the romance was the best part of the story."
2,Film review by a Miami Vice TV fan,"Very dark print, hard to understand, poor acting, not believable story line"
2,Not that good,"With a good cast and a big budget with a great locale, this one should have been a lot better.The music is good and the action scenes are well done but that's about it. The plot is okay but the dialogue is just horrible. Most of the characters seem content in just looking good and style is definitely emphasized over any substance. How does a vice cop afford a designer wardrobe anyway? And why do they cast a Chinese woman as a Cuban? Yes she is atractive but she also looks Chinese.Other than water, the Miami locale is mostly wasted. They do have land there also but they seem to miss that. Too much of this movie looks like they are posing for still shots. I'd only give it 1.5 stars."
4,"Despite its flaws, I love this","Okay, so this film has nothing in common with the television series.Yes, it should have been released with a different title.When I first saw Miami Vice, I too was disappointed with its lack of connection to the original series, but upon repeated viewings - this film really rewards.In order to watch the full version of the film, and enjoy Mann's commentary, I bought the region one version.The director's cut is far superior and I really hope it gets released in the uk at some point.As far as the film is concerned, its one flaw is that it is too realistic. Yes, the people in real life do talk with that kind of dialogue - but this is supposed to be a movie, and not a documentary. At times, Tubbs speaks in dialect that only a cop with twenty-five years on the job would understand. In this respect, Mann's excellent research has been taken a little too far. I hope, next time out, he gets the balance right between realism and entertainment."
1,One to be avoided...,"What can I say? Its hard to believe how bad this movie actually is. I cant honestly think of anything good to say about it - the movie itself was lacking on all counts and seemed like it would never end, the picture quality varied between poor and average (for a HD DVD) and the sound was no better than an average DVD. Add the fact that being a ""combo-disc"" it cost US$30 and it really does become one to be avoided at all costs. Do yourself a favour and buy something else!"
1,dvd miami vice,"really poor remake of a popular tv show, to much violence, not a good match on main stars"
2,BEWARE,"This disc is possibly not authentic BluRay original. I have had audio problems, as well as noticed the image quality is not as sharp as BluRay should be.This is possibly a burned copy. The main menu and lack of previews in the intro to the DVD are clues."
1,"terrible movie - no action, no acting - just boredom","I am glad I did not pay $10 to watch this in the theater. I am glad I did not pay $5 to rent from Blockbuster. I caught it for free on HBO and was very, very disappointed. I fell asleep half way during the movie. There are no exciting (or even non-exciting) action sequences. The acting is terrible and the story is way overdrawn.In conclusion, if you want to see Michael Mann at his best, watch Heat. If you want to see him at his worst (or are having difficulty falling asleep and need some help), watch this snooze-fest."
2,Not very good,I like Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx a lot. I think they're good actors. But they both seemed to have phoned their performances in on this one. Pretty much everybody involved did. Nothing original. Nothing to care about. The movie didn't really pick up until the scene in the trailer. Which was the end. The rest was pretty boring.
2,should have been better.....could have been better,"when i heard jamie foxx was in this movie i expected greatness because he is such a wonderfull actor,boy was i disappointed.this was 2 hours of the worst acting i have ever seen.the storyline was dragging,the scenes changed to quickly and it was just a long drawn out movie with very little action.the only reason i gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is because even though the movie was not his best jamie foxx looks so good in it.....dont buy this movie wait for cable"
3,mumbo,"Saw this movie. I stress ""saw"" because I could hardly understand a word of dialogue. The action is pretty quick and requires concentration to understand but no help is forthcoming from the co-stars. Neither gets a word out that exemplifies clear and precise diction.An otherwise enjoyable movie was ruined by the director of audio.lw"
1,Gross update to original,"This is a disappointing movie in a lot of ways. Colin Ferrel was poorly casted in the role and spends the entire movie looking like Yanni with his mustache and long hair. And you can tell he is trying to make his voice sound like Don Johnson to whole time.The story is very simple and could have been a one hour episode instead of a long drawn out feature film.Even though it's the same director that was associated with the original Miami Vice TV series, I feel he failed in making this movie. While there are some cool shots and action sequences, the movie is lacking in virtually every other aspect."
3,Not worth a Friday Night,"The original series was the only must see Friday Night show worth staying home for. The series was captivating and inspiring in many ways. The music and fashion were as much a part of the show as the plot was. Sadly the movie does not live up to this. I felt the movie storyline stayed true to the original characters and the plot would have made for a solid episode, but there was nothing special about the movie. The movie gets by on its name and the longing of the watcher to go back to and relive the 80's. This movie is worth a Sunday afternoon not a Friday night."
5,A BIG Miami Vice Fan!,"I am one of those 80's child who grew up with Miami Vice and Ferraris, and this movie is sure to bring back a lot of memories! Even though there is some negative publicity surrounding Jamie Foxx on the set, I am sure it would not affect the success of the movie in anyway! Viva Miami!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME,"I can believe what they did with Miami Vice.Dont waste your 140 minutes on this movie, it SUCKSSSSSSSSSSSSSS"
2,Better Movie,I think it would have been a better movie with Matthew McConaugney and Terrence Howard as the lead actors.
1,Major disappointment,"What a waste of my hard earned $10.00.I was a huge fan of the Miami Vice TV series in the 80's, I still have every single episodes of MV on beta tapes. Although, my beta machine no long works, thanks to DVD, I can watch the first two seasons over and over again until season three comes out.When I first heard of Miami Vice the movie, I was hoping that it would turn out to be another one of Michael Mann's classic stylish movie like the Thief, Heat and Collateral. But I walked out of the movie theater totally disappointed.While the TV series were built on Crockett and Tubb's partnership - season one's pilot episode, and their friendship - season one's ""Evan"" episode, the movie has none of that. There were absolutely no chemistry between the two stars. Instead of building on the two's relationship, Mann wasted half of the movie on Crockett's romantisizing Isabella.As for the gun battles, there was no comparisn to Heat's bank heist's sequence."
1,What a bore!,i was amazed that you could take such an innovative TV show from the 80's and make it into such a boring movie. Action was slow and predictable. Casting was horrible. Even the cars weren't as good as in the TV show. I am glad I only rented tis and didn't buy it. Don't waste these 2 hours of your life on this flick.
3,Movie is great but the contents $uck!,"Over the years when you buy special edition DVDs like Director's Cut or Special Edition, you get premium contents like inserts and collectible items perhaps. Unfortunately, this is not true with this edition. I was really disappointed. No inserts and the DVD disc itself is plainly printed with Miami Vice text, that's it! Nothing close to other disc which are printed with quality silkscreen/laser graphics. If you are after the movie itself, go for it. But if you are a collector like me, get something else like Pirates of the Caribbean 2."
1,Miami Vice The Movie ain't that great.,This movie ain't that great. The only innovative part of the whole movie was when Jamie Foxx flew in an Adam Air (is that correct?) very light airplane only feet behind another small airplane while working undercover to create the 'cloaking' effect and fool the radar screens in South Florida. Much of the rest of the movie wasn't innovative at all-like when Tubbs and this underworld criminal sneak into Cuba by boat (uh huh yeah right) and then hang out in a bar and order drinks with funny slang Spanish-language names. It doesn't even look like Cuba it looks like a cardboard prop! They spent $125 million making this? This movie lacks the thumping music from the TV show as well. When I say 'innovative' this movie was nowhere near as innovative as Michael Mann's 10 years earlier 'Heat'HeatHeat was truly a landmark movie the music and all. Miami Vice barely lasted a week when it hit the Dollar theaters in Texas. AWFUL MOVIE!
3,Forget it,"Please, forget this director's cut, the theater version is so better. Mann has changed the introduction sequence, all the perception of the movie in not the same as before. Take the cut, forget the director's cut, or buy the french collector edition, you have the two version of the movie in the same set."
3,Miami Impossible,"Those of you who pine for such ""classic"" TV fare as the original Miami Vice will be doomed to disappointment. The only thing this movie takes from the TV show is the title and the names of the 2 lead characters. Otherwise, one might say it was ""inspired"" by the TV show in the same way that other movies are ""inspired"" by true events. Similarly, if you're looking for something resembling realism, look elsewhere. The budget for the film exceeded the annual budget for the entire Miami police department. However, taken on its own at face value, it's a lot of fun. Lots of bangs for your bucks. tons of atmosphere, pretty girls, etc. It's not Jane Austin nor intended to be taken as high art. As for the arguments in the other reviews over whether Jamie and Colin's guns are bigger than Don and Thomas', well see it and decide for yourself. The movie is certainly diverting enough for the time it takes to watch it, even if it will never make anyone's top 100 list."
2,very slow/very quiet,"This movie just didn't make sense, it starts out with the ususal club scene where everyone is so cool and some unsavory characters. the sound was very quiet and i felt I didnt understand what was going on from the get go...it's like the director started the middle of the movie in the beginning where you're just lost!I wouldn't watch it again."
2,Just not that good,What a muddled and incoherant mess! First: Who was the leak in the FBI? The question was never answered that my husband and I could figure out.Second: We finally had to turn on the subtitles because the movie was full of incoherant mumbling dialogue.Third: Are we the audience expected to believe that the main drug lord would not be mad if Gong Li's character was sleeping with another man?Save your money and rent or buy something else. This one is not worth it.
3,Pretty good but nothing to do with Miami Vice,"This was a pretty good film on it's own but it could just as well have been given another title like ""UNDERCOVER"", since it really had virtually nothing to do with the Miami Vice franchise.I suppose the studios knew the name MIAMI VICE would help draw crowds, but there is only a passing similarity to the characters and image of the original series."
3,expected more...,"Action wise, it was stunning! But the storyline/plot, the pace was kinda slow moving and i didnt know what was going on most of the time. Colin Ferrell and Jamie Foxx played good parts! I thought Miami Vice was gonna be way better than it actually was. It didnt suck, but it wasnt amazing either! Watch it and judge for yourself what you think!"
1,A must miss,"The theatrical version of ""Miami Vice"" was a huge disappointment. It lacks a coherent plot, and like its TV counterpart, it's all style (or wants to be) and very little substance. About the only thing going for it is the atmospheric cinematography. But with little to no plot, it's a hard one to sit through.The always stellar Jamie Foxx is completely wasted - he has little to do but act as back up for his hot headed partner (not a bad way to collect a multi-million dollar payout); the other detectives on the team have literally no screen time at all.I was expecting a lot more considering it was directed by Michael Mann. It wasn't even on par with a cheesy Jerry Bruckheimer film. I was shocked that two relatively good actors were reduced to this tripe - the acting was so stiff that Colin Farrell (who needed a shower desperately) makes Don Johnson look like a thespian."
4,Solid Movie - HEATlike,IF you liked HEAT you should like this movie. Good soundtrack. Big shootout scene (like HEAT). It was better than I though it would be.
3,Miami Vice Blu-Ray,"This is an excellent movie and I recently purchased the Blu-Ray version of this software because I liked the movie so much. Previously I had purchased and watched the DVD version and I was expecting truly great video in the Blu-Ray version. Sadly, many of the night scenes in the Blu-Ray version are just too grainy. Buy the regular DVD version and save the extra bucks."
2,Casting disappointment,"This movie contained alot of nice visual effects and the sound effects were pretty impressive. However, for some reason Gong Li who is Chinese played the role a Cuban woman who was the lead actress in the movie. It says alot about the Hollywood studios that they can't cast qualified Hispanics for leading roles even in movies that take place in or are about Latin America. This was a major setback to the film, it lacked believability, it was not genuine to me at all."
5,My garage door opens!,"Make sure that you read the instructions first and get the correct remote. LiftMasters run on different frequencies, and that's why a lot of people are getting screwed. If you are replacing a remote, the best thing to do is look at the back for the model #. There's also something about the color of the learn button, but I programmed mine on a different kind of garage door opener/control box. It was easy. I programmed it the first time. I can get into and out of my garage now without having to get out of my car and run around like a crazy dude."
5,Functional and cheap!,Ordered two garage clickers and both of them worked on my lift master garage opener. Fraction of the retail price and fully functional!
5,Worked perfectly,I bought this replacement remote to operate the entry gate in my community. Was easy to program using the switch pins inside.
2,Not enough detail for successful tanning,"No offense to the author, but this book just doesn't have enough detail to successfully teach you to tan a hide. I tan and teach home tanning for a living, and I regularly meet folks who have used this book as their reference and failed to produce anything remotely like leather. There is nothing inaccurate about the information but their just isn't enough detail. Tanning is a fairly simple craft, but it is very tactile and precise. You need to know the details, the ins and outs. Amazon.com sells two books that I highly recommend if you wish to learn home-tanning: DEERSKINS INTO BUCKSKINS: How to Tan With Natural Materials, and Wetscrape Braintan Buckskin. Get one or both and you'll get the results you're looking for."
3,CWA review book,"The ""Detection Technologies for CWAs and Toxic Vapors"" is a good introductory book. The authors did a decent job of reviewing basic instrument technology. Personally, I was looking for an integrated sampling plan and specific equipment recommendations- the authors failed to address those areas. It also uses dated material- many of the documents referenced were 1997 Army tests, which have sometimes been superseded. At $125 for a small book, it's overpriced for the general market (first responders) and lacking in details for the specific chem warfare chemist market. It's a good introduction to testing methodology and reads like one of the SBCCOM/RDECOM testing manuals (that's because the authors work there)."
5,Wonderful Scriabin!!,"Alexander Melnikov is a wonderful pianist and you will never hear a finer Scriabin recital. His technical magnificence permits him to concenterate solely on conveying the extreme emotions and vivid colours of the music. He is fastidious in his reading of the scores and yet manages to play with great imagination, electricity and improvisatory freedom. Buy this recording and be intoxicated by Scriabin!!"
4,The man is a true artist.,"Who is this guy to release a live cut of his '89 performances 14 years later? The man's the king of South Africa with Rabbit, charms Chris Squire into joining up which eventually leads to the most widely popular version of Yes. Knocks out a very underrated ""Can't look away"" studio album and then leaves Yes for very impressive Soundtrack career. His next move will be big you can count on it and this is a sampler.About this cut: ""Owner"" sucks, the ""Lift me up"" intro is a gas, and the rest of the disk will never get nearly the acclaim it deserves. If it weren't a CD I would have worn it out."
5,"Rabin, come back!","Well I am buying these the Live CD and 90124. Mr Rabin please do some more albums, PLEASE. Hey after you listen to the album please come on over to www.yesfans.com and tell us about it."
1,Who are the singers?,I can't rate this title because I didn't hear it. I really want to know who are the artists that make the tribute to Shania. I appreciate somebody to tell me. Thanks.
4,An aur-gasm if I've ever heard one!,"I first heard Uncle Green from a friend of mine when he ""rediscovered"" them--apparently he had an old cassette dub that had listened to death and then found the CD.Wow. Musically, they're richer than almost anything you'll find on the market today. Tons of instruments, all blending beautifully with the vocals. If that's what you like, then you'll LOVE this.Unfortunately, their writing is a little stiff, and some of the songs are lyrically quite bland. But that isn't a problem until the hundredth or so listening; and by then, you're stuck with liking them....so go ahead! You won't be sorry."
4,good,"I USE MY PHONE A LOT...SO IT DIES AFTER THE USE OF A FEW HOURS....BUT WHEN I FIRST GOT IT, IT WOULD LAST ME UP TO THREE DAYS....NO PROBLEM.....I SAY ITS PERFICT FOR A PERSON THAT DOES NOT USE HIS/HER PHONE FOR BISNESS.....NOW I'M HAPPY WITH THE EXTENDED BATTERY....IT'S PERFICT FOR ME....BUT THE REGULAR BATTERY IS ALSO GREAT.....BUT NOT FOR EVERYONE.."
1,Don't buy this tape,"This videotape is responsible for taking an hour of my life that I will never get back. The viewer is forced to watch a series of drunk white tourists ""do India,"" and never gets a chance to enjoy the rich culture and beauty that is South India. I am honestly shocked that the Lonely Planet, whose travel guides have helped me tremendously in my travels through Africa and Central America, would put their stamp on such a terrible product. There must be a better resource to help the traveler navigate the natural, cultural and spiritual wonders of the region. This video is trash! Don't waste your money."
5,: ),"Wounderfull spells and ideas. Tons of information on lots of topics not focusing on one thing. This book is well presented with pretty pictures and a soft velvet cover. Not only will this book last countless abuse, but perhaps it'll still be around to give to my children when they grow up. I would recommend this for any witches libary."
2,"Good, but...","It states that it's a book of white magic, but it's a bit different than that. Organized by the 13 moons in a year, Enchanted explores magick on a time/purpose basis, and is a great book for those discovering how nature works together."
1,fluffy playgan heaven,"Yet another bandwagon book for the wannabe neo pagan,this book does not touch upon even the basics of spellcraft and magical workings.The title alone ought to give serious practitioners pause,as it is commonly understood within the pagan community that magic has no color,only intent."
4,mr hendry,"Like a mix of the wallflowers ,counting crows and matchbox 20. mr hendry has released a great cd, 10 tracks coming in at just over 35 minites makes for repeated listens. the first time i played the cd there didnt seem to be anything new, but by the forth or fith the cd started to show hidden depth and songs like 'one', 'tuesday' and 'mrs anderson' are fast becoming firm favorites. the cd is produced by david bryson (counting crows) who also lends a hand in guitar duites as well."
1,anxious,I can't review because your webb site says it is not currently available. Will it be before Christmas?
4,THE DOWN TOWN,"I first listened to the Down Town on my Days of the New1 cd and I loved to words, the acustic guitar. There is a fantastic intro at the beginining, in short this song is for acustic lovers and alternative extremists, and everyone in between."
2,Not impressed!,"I bought this because it reminded me of my father, who played french horn when he was in high school. It came on a necklace that wouldn't even fit over my head. It was THAT small of a necklace...maybe it'll fit a kid or an infant, but definitely not an adult. Plus the band does not come apart without me having to take a pair of scissors and cut the band. There is no clip-type fastener. The french horn itself feels like it's made out of plastic or some other light weight material. If you are looking for a nice piece of jewelry, I do not recommend this piece."
5,military,This is a great toy for any child that loves military toys. My 6 y.o. grandson couldn't put it away. Very durable.
2,I Used To Love This Album,"I owned Liza Minnelli's ""Results"" on CD in the 1990s and would play it just about every day on my stereo. About a decade later, the novelty started wearing off; and I ended up selling it. Today, I only downloaded two songs on my iTunes player--""Losing My Mind"" and ""If There Was Love"". The rest of the album is now completely forgettable, including the ear-achingly remake of ""Love Pains"", which should have included a fade-out at the end of the track; ""Don't Drop Bombs"", one of the stupidest titles for a song; and the closer, ""I Just Can't Say Goodnight"", which sounds like a reject from the ""Three's Company"" soundtrack. This is positive proof that Liza Minnelli's experiment with pop music went haywire--and no amount of help from the Pet Shop Boys could avert this catastrophe. ""Results"" is even more dated than when Epic first issued this disc--in 1989!"
3,A couple good Pet Shop Boys covers,"While I'm not a Liza Minnelli fan, I am a Pet Shop Boys fan, and I absolutely love her cover (all songs were produced by Pet Shops Boys on this album) of ""Tonight is Forever"" and for PSB fans out there, that cover alone is reason to pick up this CD. Aside from that I didn't really enjoy the other songs but a Lize Minnelli fan would be someone you should get for their opinion on that.I have to rate the CD as a whole which is 3 stars, but if I could only rate that one cover song, I'd give it 5 stars."
5,Liza at her best for younger audiences with Pet Shop Boys,"Liza has always been an American icon. She is also an icon for many people who like her style, her voice and attitude. More than 12 years ago Liza made this album with the European Disco guys Pet Shop Boys. This cd is eternal. I consider it a Disco Classic. The melding of her particularly great voice with the up-beat rythm of the PSB is the greatest combination. Even over the years, this cd is a must for any PSB, Liza or Disco fan. My favorite songs? the classic LOSING MY MIND. Also, the sad sounding SO SORRY, I SAID. The crazy rythm in DON'T DROP BOMBS. Her own version of RENT. Her voice is crystal clear that combined with the disco-ball rythm will keep your feet separate from the ground. In 2 words: GET IT"
5,"Liza, disco diva? Who knew?","When ""Results"" was released in 1989, it was unfairly trashed by critics who dismissed Minnelli as a past-her-prime vocalist desperate to jump on the top 40 bandwagon. They couldn't be more wrong. ""Results"" is a fabulous album that transformed Liza into a disco diva. The album's tracks are unmistakedly PSB, but Minelli gives them personality and depth. The opener ""I Want You Now"" ends any and all speculation as to whether Minnelli can pull it off on the dancefloor, and the groove doesn't let up for the rest of the disc. Minnelli purists will be horrified, but everyone else including PSB fans should pick this winner up. Results guaranteed."
5,euro-pop outing,"This is a great euro-pop record produced by pop-masters the Pet Shop Boys. They even wrote several of the tracks. Included is an orchestral version of ""Tonight is Foever"" and a brooding, moody version of ""Rent."" Also included is a crunchy hip-hop remaked of Tanita Takarem's ""Twisting My Sobriety."" A disco romp called ""Losing My Mind"" is very close to Pet Shop Boys' ""Always On My Mind."" My favorite is a very sad, reflective ballad called ""So Sorry I Said."" A very sophisticated poppy album."
1,Shocked and saddened,"I bought this because on the cheapies I'm used to, the thumbscrew that adjusts the grind comes loose and the mill stops working. Imagine my chagrin when this $70 Peugeot did the same thing! Would have returned it but I waited too long. Pass on this thing for sure!"
5,Great Import,"This import contains 3 great tracks, an album version of ""Stay,"" a radio edit of ""Stay,"" and a live version of ""Lover Lay Down."" Excellent listening pleasure for any ears, especially those that belong to you seasoned DMB fans!"
5,Dave at its Best,"Dave is the best of the best of the pop rock genre, bridging the gap between jazz and rock. That's what makes his songs so awesome. If you're expecting a standard rock group, Dave isn't for you, but if you're at all open to listening to music other than metal or classic rock, this song will turn you into an instant convert.If you're a skeptic who doesn't understand exactly why Dave is so popular, just listen to this song and you'll understand. This is pop rock at its BEST.If you're one of those people who've heard alot of Dave and don't think it can get much better, listen to this song. In my opinion it is the best upbeat song he's ever written. After the first half, it gets repetitive, but the first half is AMAZING."
2,Light Reading on a Very Heavy Subject,"I started out with high hopes for Toch's tale of five ""small school"" high schools attempting to break out of the mold of the traditional, comprehensive factory model high school. Toch's goal is to show how these schools have been organized, the challenges they faced, and still face, and the issue of whether the small schools are working for students, supposedly all students. Toch's accounts, however,are filled with unnecessary comments regarding the dress of students in the schools, and judgements on Urban students that make the reader wonder what his actual goal for the book was. More importantly, Toch's studies are seriously lacking in an analysis of the academic impact the schools are having on student achievement.This book is an easy read, with short choppy sentences, but if you are looking for a book that will help you better understand what small schools have to offer, this is not for you."
3,Depends if you own the other tapes already,"If you only had one UFC Tape, this would be a good bet - IT IS A COMPILATION of various celebrated UFC champions (and veterans) fights. You will probably have seen most of these already on other tapes. Frank Shamrock's fight is a new one (to me anyway). So, it is good as a resource, but lacks the excitement and build up and 'live' feel of any other UFC tape.Get the other tapes first, unless you want an overview of what UFC is all about."
5,Frank Shamrock vs Jeremy Horn,thank you for having this title. the shamrock vs horn fight that determines who the ultimate fighting champion is of the middleweight division is very rare and very hard to find. this fight is included on this video. i actually had to find my vcr before i ordered this vhs tape :D success !!
5,Excellent Reading,"Even though you know how it ends, this book was well written and held my attention from the beginning. I was so drawn in, I read it in one sitting."
2,Poorly written and disappointing,"This disappointing book is little more than a clumsy re-write, if not downright plagiarism, of Dan McKinnon's ""Bullseye One Reactor"", written more than a decade ago. The writing is inelegant and marred by cliches and grammatical and factual errors, and the much-touted access the author had to previosuly classified records and personnel appears to have been wasted, since Claire doesn't tell us anything (except the real names of the pilots) that McKinnon didn't tell us 15 years ago. Indeed, in many stretches the writing is suspiciously close to a verbatim copy of McKinnon's text, notwithstanding Claire's supposed access to sources McKinnon didn't have. Lucky for Claire, the underlying true story is so riveting that the flaws of the book can to some extent be overlooked, but it's a shame the author didn't make more of a truly incredible tale."
2,"Short on facts, format garbled...","Previous posts regarding inaccuracies must be taken in context- There are only a couple of these errors, and none detract from the narrative. Yes, Jane's could have told us that the SA-6 isn't a heat-seeking missile, but hey... My biggest beef with the book is that it glosses over most of the topics it addresses- I was most curious about just how they formatted their training (not to mention kept from telegraphing their intentions to all their friendly neighbors in the region!), but all we really read is that the pilots learned it's hard to fly low for extended periods of time! Other issue in the Kindle format is that you get the epilogue at the start of the book and the prologue at the end. An OK ""adventure story"", but that's about it..."
3,Raid on the Sun,"It was a very interesting book politically, tactically and good profiling of the personalities of the pilots - not all of which were likeable. One could not help contrasting the latter as to whether that would have been allowed to exist in the USAF or the RAF - unlikely I suspect. I was only aware of two inaccuracies: in a helicopter you would not ""smell diesel "" but JP4 and (page 117) your don't land with ""afterburners kicked on"" unless you are planning to take off or go around which in this case the pilot was certainly not !"
2,"Lots of technical ""howlers""","I am giving this book two stars because it is an interesting and compelling story. But the technical errors are far too many and too serious to allow me to recommend it to anyone with a technical background. Some examples: (1) neutrons emitted from a fissioning nucleus at the speed of light (only massless particles can go the speed of light) and (2) US F-16's carrying Stinger missiles (they carry air-to-air Sidewinders not shoulder-fired Stingers). The author does not understand the simplest physics of nuclear reactors or weapons even though he could have gotten the information easily from Richard Rhodes ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"". Since the author got so many things wrong that would have been easy to find out, I have to wonder how many other kinds of errors were made that I didn't catch."
4,This book is a fast and entertaining read,"If you are interested in military and middle east history, this may be a book for you. It has a good pace and is very easy reading. The pace of the book is not quite as fast as BlackHawk Down, but better than Bowden's other book, Killing Pablo. It almost has that 'reads like fiction' feel. I agree though, with one of the other posters comments that I read, and that is that there are alot of technical details that are not correct, (like ""heat seeking Sparrow's"") which does beg the question of whether or not he did not did not get all the facts right. But none the less, still a fun read and if even only half of it is right, its still an amazing story. I will highly recommend this book to my friends."
3,"Interesting, but too many errors","I enjoyed this book, although it seemed that the author was trying to boost the page count by including extraneous details. The writing wouldn't pass muster either in a serious newspaper or in a writing class.The part that bothered me the most was the lack of proofreading. For example, there's a description of the liftoff of the fully loaded fighters which talks about passing the 5000 meter mark on the runway. Even B-52 bombers don't require 5000 meters, much less fighter planes. [Diego Garcia, the US military base in the Indian Ocean has 2.25 mile runways for B-52s, which is only about 3.6km or 3600 meters.] As another example, there are several references to Ammunition Hill in Jerusalem (Givat Hatachmoshet) which is first mistransliterated as Givat Hatachmoshem and then mistranslated (although I can't recall the translation).It's a fun read, but it would be better at half the length and twice the proofreading."
4,Great Freshman Release,"Holland Nix, a Nashville artist, does not fit into any cookie-cutter musician stereotype. Earthy voice, earthy look, pure style... This CD is a stripped-down production in the sense that it's not over-produced as so many rock/pop projects are today. Holland's vocal delivery is honest - you will find yourself listening to the lyrics, as you should, instead of having them get lost in the over-use of a lead guitar. My favorite cut is the Airplane Song. I travel a lot and it's hilarious how she expresses every traveler's lament. Don't buy this record if you're looking for a shiny record label symbol of ""music"". Buy this if you are looking for an awesome journey through poignant lyrics delivered by an honest, if not sometimes awesomely imperfect, voice."
2,Annoying.,"You would have to wonder, wouldn't you, if a StarFleet captain could describe the cituation with galactic barrier better, like maybe not giving that much weight towards glowing eyes and echoing voice and going for the sensor readings instead? I could never completely warm up towards the original ST tv series, because of their naivette and simplicity. I did, however enjoy the books. (The characters are great!) This book, unfortunately, managed to take all that I did not like about the series and bring it to the new level. As I said, annoying!"
4,"It was a great, interesting, and sad all at the same time.","I did enjoy the book along with the other books in the trilogy Star Trek ""Brother's Keeper."" I always wandered what would happen after James T. Kirk had killed his best friend Gary Mitchell after I the Star Trek Original Series episode ""Where No Man Has Gone Before."""
2,Rather weak and predictable,"I am not a big Jan Michael Friedman fan and this book is an example of why. First of all, the story was completely predictable without a single surprise, not one. But there is a deeper problem, and that derives from some of Friedman's writing mannerisms. He uses adjectives and pronouns in a cloying, irritating way, to wit: The upperclassman (meaning Kirk) and his companion (meaning Gary Mitchell) did this or that, and Kirk's friend (meaning Mitchell) alerted his comrade (meaning Kirk) etc. etc. I did not know quite how to characterize this writing style, except to say that I found it to be annoying and distracting from the story. And candidly, there is not much of a story here, or in Friedman's other books about Kirk and Mitchell.I know that Friedman has a following, and that's fine. But I did not enjoy this book and I generally do not enjoy Friedman's writing, although I tried to."
1,Poor,"Star Trek books have become a joke and this one is the definitive proof. Lack of good story telling, inconsistent plots, and no attention to scientific accuracy have become the hallmark of Star Trek books in general. This one is no exception. Only Star Trek fans are dumb enough to continue to invest money in these trashy, poorly written and positively dull stories."
4,Pretty Good,"This book has many different and interesting plays for kids of all ages. Though, for most of them you need a lot of people, they are still pretty good. Thats why I give it 4 stars."
3,why not a decaf in this flavor,"I have been sending General Foods a request on this for many years now. General Foods changed the formula of this product (which the fans did not like) and now they are changing it back, but they can't make a Decaf??? GF - Listen to your customers!!! We have been waiting 20 years for this!!!"
3,"""Ho-Hum Book""",This novel was O.K. I don't know who got under my skin more Logan or Rachel. All in all this novel was kinda boring.
5,A Love Worth Waiting Eight Years For!,"I loved Undeniable! The chemistry between Logan and Rachel was out of this world. The story line was great. The all to common 'one or both of my parents are against my choosen mate,' but Ms Ray adds chemistry to her stories that her readers will not find anything common about! Ms Ray has again wrote a book that her fans can really enjoy! Please go out and great yourself a copy. Much Love to Ms Ray!"
2,Not her best,"This book fits all the negative corny cliches of a bad romance novel - revenge, manipulative father, rich, naieve, innocent teenager, big bad poor guy from the tracks come back 8 years later with revenge in his heart. I felt no connection with any of the characters perhaps except Ida Mae -lol , Ms Ray can write a whole let better than this, best to borrow rather than buy."
4,"A LITTLE DIFFERENT, BUT THAT'S GOOD!","This is a fine album with great musical talent. Probably overlooked by many because only two of the original band members (Keagy and Gillis) along with bassist Gary Moon are here. The tracks are strong for the most part with driving rhythms and fine guitar work. Vocals are right on the money. If you are a NR fan, don't overlook it!"
2,Meh. Not doing it for me.,"While in principle this CD should be good, it isn't really. There is no denying the MUSIC is fantastic as usual- what you'd expect from Night Ranger. It's also true that Gary Moon has a good voice if you're into the whole Axel Rose/Stephen Percy/Mark Slaughter sound. But the two together- not so good. The way the recording was mixed was odd too. A couple of the songs have the music overpowering the singer, which doesn't help. Best songs? ""Feeding of the Mojo"" and ""Do You Feel Like I Do / Tomorrow Never Knows"". Kudos for the cover art."
4,"a good album, but not for everyone.","This album features a different version of Night Ranger. Guitarist Brad Gillis and drummer/singer Kelly Keagy teamed up with bassist/singer Gary Moon. This album is worth checking out despite the absense of Jack Blades and Jeff Watson. Brad and Kelly are also quite talented and together with Gary Moon they made a very good album. It helps perhaps to think of it not as a Night Ranger album, but rather as an album from 2 of the Night Ranger guys. The one thing I did not like about the album is Gary Moon's vocals. Gary Moon sounds a lot like Cinderella's lead singer, and I really just can't handle his singing style. Which is too bad, because otherwise it's a really good album. But, I recognize that some people don't mind that kind of singing, and if you are one of those people, then this is definitely an album worth getting."
1,"Yes, but how's it done?","The hardest thing for a writer is to show not tell - great title, but the author in this slender book has failed completely in showing how it's done. This is my take.Tell: Amber was a very beautiful woman, tall and elegant. Men couldn't take their eyes off her.Show: As Amber entered the bar, every woman turned to watch her.Tell: John was a violent man and Mary had the bruises to prove it.Show: Mary heard the car pull up outside and looked round the kitchen to make sure everything was tidy. John hated mess. She took a cold beer from the fridge and glanced at herself in the mirror. The bruise under her right eye had almost healed."
4,Great Adventure,"My party has given this adventure 5 big thumbs up. It is one of the adventures that be bring up most offten when speaking of games of your. It is very hard to find a game that challanges the mind of players now a days (especialy at mid level), but this modual with its unique traps and puzzles challenges without having to resort to violance every two rounds.The gods of chaos introuced in this modual are very interesting. I wish they had more information on them. It fits very easly into an existing champain world."
2,Ahhhh.... I don't know about this,"Hmmmmmmm.... I was disappointed with this one. I've seen Garnier live before and I was very impressed with his set. ""30"" is my first CD of Garnier's. To say the least, this CD was a bore to me. There is only one track that I liked and that was ""Flashback"". This CD is way overrated and so is the track ""Crispy Bacon"". Avoid this one and maybe try something else of Garnier's."
1,No power supply,"Wasn't able to use the speaker since there was no power supply in the box. When I called to get the power supply sent to me overnight, I was told by Amazon that they may not be able to get it for at least 3 weeks. They offered to sell me a power supply at a discounted price - what? Makes me think they knew going in that they had no power supply's for this product. No bueno."
2,Know what you are buying,"BEFORE YOU BUY THIS BOOK. Understand that this book is nearly 10 years old and focuses on a business model that is near extinct.When this book was first printed in 1996 it would have been considered a basic ""seminar in a book"" about selling and establishing income from nature photography. While the book does have some timeless information on common sense, it for the most part is archaic in content.There are many fans of John Shaw out there but when it comes to buying a book and expecting content that I can use, my own expectations are to get the product as advertised.If you want a John Shaw book on nature photography, stick to his other publications. This one belongs next to DOS 4 and my Windows 3.1 manuals."
5,Good Advice from a Pro,"So you want to make a living taking nature pictures? John Shaw shows you how in his latest Amphoto book. Subjects covered are getting started, office work, submissions, writing to complement your photography, and money matters. Shaw provides beautiful photos along the way both to inspire and to set a standard for the aspiring photographer."
3,Not So Great,The book has some good content but the quizes and exercises are [bad] The exercises are just multiple choice questions that are so easy most 2nd graders could probably handle them. Overall not a great book for adults.
4,Good architectural overview,"Up front, I should state that I have been working w/BizTalk for the last six months. To say that the documentation currently available on BizTalk is lacking is an understatement. What I particularly like about this book is the fact that several chapters are devoted to the architectural underpinnings of BizTalk (for example, the author describes the way that servers are broken out and what the different databases contain, down to the objects in the databases). He also clearly explains the various concepts within BizTalk such as ports, messaging ports etc. All in all, this book is the best one currently available if you are interested in the architectural and development aspects of BizTalk and don't want to plough through the 1500-page Microsoft tome."
4,Great Introduction to BizTalk,"This book provides a great introduction to BizTalk. The author puts the software into its proper context, provides a solid introduction to its architecture, and gives just enough ""how-to"" to get started.Reading this book first will give you what you need to approach more in-depth material, e.g. Microsoft Press's BizTalk Server 2000 Documented."
2,Not for beginners,"If you are looking for a beginners book on BizTalk that will take you through lessons on how to use BizTalk Server 2000, this isn't the book. The first few chapters are on EDI and SOAP. The discussion on SOAP is scatter brained and it takes too long to get into the Basics of BizTalk. When it does get into the basics there just isn't enough there. I have seen better guides to using BizTalk."
5,Best book availiable on the civil war in lebanon,"Having examined many books on the topic, I found Fisk's book to be the best by far. Granted its not overly academic (he IS a journalist first and foremost) it is still highly readable. I have read this book 3 times and it was most of the reason I went to Lebanon for the summer of 2003 and I have returned 5 times since... as for anti-semetic or anti-israeli? one only has to go to Lebanon to see the horrific damage still glaringly evident in parts of lebanon wrought in large part by israel's invasions. I question if those that accuse him of this have been to see Sabra or Chatila refugee camps or south lebanon, I have and its not pretty. Beside all that, his book is valuable (though somewhat dated) asset in understanding the politics and history of the incredible events ongoing in Lebanon today... great book!"
2,"An impressionistic account, not history","""Pity the Nation"" is more a diary of Fisk's travels and experiences in Lebanon than a history of the Lebanese Civil War. Fisk vividly describes events he sees, but what occurs beyond his literal field of vision is undocumented. As an example, Fisk spends four chapters discussing the 1982 Sabra and Chatila massacre, but only two pages on the 1985-1988 War of the Camps (where Amal killed more Palestinians than Elie Hobeika).Fisk brings to life a few of his reporter friends, but the main political actors of the war are only described from a distance."
3,Pity which nation?,"This book is well written and provides a unique prospective, however it is a one-sided account. I kept getting the feeling when I was reading the book that it is a story about the Palestinians and Israelis, and not the Lebanese.He starts off the book by examining the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. After the Israeli invasion he gives no insight into the Christian/Conservative perspective (which he never really examined in the beginning of the book), and for a man who takes such care in portraying characters like Arafat and Shia radicals in a fair and unbiased light, he simply criticizes and make fun of General Aoun. The only subject he talks about since the early 90's is Israel's incursions into Lebanon. He ignores all other issues. To get a more unbiased view I would recommend ""Faces of Lebanon: Sects, Wars, and Global Extensions"".I think it is a bit ironic that he entitles the book ""Pity the Nation""- which nation does he show pity for: Lebanon or Palestine?"
4,product in good order. Arrived on time.,The roduct arrived in good working order and also arrived will in time. Exellent service.
4,the journey is more important than the destination,"I gave this little deck of cards to my uptight, control freak brother-in-law for Christmas hoping that, at the very least, he wouldn't scoff at them. To my surprise, the cards drew him in with their variety of silly, useful, practical & thought-provoking suggestions. I felt that I had done a big favor for my sister, who was becoming bored with the fellow she loved. I think he sensed her irritation anyway, because he's taking her to Disneyworld this winter instead of to some stuffy bed & breakfast place in New England. Hopefully, the cards will remind him that the journey is more important than the destination.Bob Rixon"
5,one of my desert island cd's,"In college, my friends and I used to always ask if we were stuck on a deserted island and we could only have five cd's which would they be? My list always changed, except for this album. It is one of my all time favorites. Not only is the music amazing throughout (especially in GIVE THE MUSIC BACK, among many others). YOU NEVER KNOW WHO YOUR FRIENDS ARE remains one of my all time favorite songs. The Hooters, sadly, never are recognized for their lyrics as well as their musical talents. If you were to listen to each of their albums, you would see how their lyrics improved greatly, but you would notice the amazing variety of music they produce. They put their heart and soul in each song, and it comes through brilliantly each time. Enjoy the ride."
3,Dees picks his targets,"No one could help but be a fan of Mr. Dees when he is addressing issues of white racism. That people like him stood up years ago for justice when others turned their backs, should be commended. But reading this book in the light of current events made me wonder: is the bigotry in a church, say, like Jeremiah Wright's dealt with by the SPLC? Just go to the Southern Poverty site and check for yourself. No way. It seems bigotry is only one-sided. This ashame. Bigotry in all its forms should be dealt with in an even-handed manner. It just makes you wonder what (or what isn't) going on down there in Montgomery."
1,Unbalanced Historical View,"Peter Beresford Ellis's book gives the initial impression of a scholarly and thorough treatment of his subject, but its unpleasant political undertones eventually become clear.He claims that the Anglo-Saxons waged a war of extermination against the people of Britain after the fall of the Roman Empire. He attributes a unity and aggressive purpose to a haphazard series of Germanic migrations, that is simply not borne out by the evidence presented. Indeed, his accusations against the English people border on racism. He misses the point that the British imperial drive has its roots in Norman, not Saxon history; the record of the Normans in the Mediterranean and the Holy Land are evidence enough of this. It is a shame that such a potentially important book should be ruined by predjudice."
2,Not Attractive,"This hoodie is missing a zipper cover so it looks wierd as the zipper is clearly visible on the front of the hoddie, making it look cheap. Cover it up and things are good otherwise."
2,has a bit of static with the sound,not worth it to buy. but it's an old item. the ear piece is not as comfortable either.
1,Clickity Clack don't buy that,"I have tried 2 different Jabra Earbooms. I sent the first one back because I thought it was deffective, but both make clickity clack snap crackle pop noises with my Motorola 720. So, iffen you have this phone, I can't recommend it."
2,Ear Boom? Hardly,The ear attatchments are great but it didn't plug into my phone very well (Nokia) and the sound was aweful but if all your looking for is a part time use ear phone then this will work. I really liked the way the attatchments fit my ear snuggly and I didn't have to worry about it falling out which usually happens with the stock one that Nokia sent me. The clip is a little big and bulky too.
3,Action-packed adventure with original plot,"I was originally interested in this book because of my fascination with Anne Boleyn. The Anne Boleyn in this book is quite an intriguing character, even though she is technically dead for most of the novel. This is an exciting episodic novel, with the ""heroic"" characters much more interesting than the villians, who are rather one-dimensional. Be warned, though, there are many graphic and rather bloody scenes. If this were a movie, I'd have to turn away many times. I found it to be a fairly quick read, considering its length."
2,Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"""The Majesty of the Blues"" is basically a tale of two CDs: one solid, and one shoddy. The first three songs (particularly the title track) are well-executed and almost burning with intensity. However, the CD is plagued by a long, drawn-out, totally unnecessary sermon on the fourth track that completely destroys the mood you built up to that point. The final song is also not crisply executed and is not really an appropriate closer for the album.As much as I like Wynton Marsalis, I cannot recommend this album. If you do buy it, then buy it for the title track alone. Otherwise, ""Black Codes"" or ""Levee Low Moan"" would be a much better buy."
3,Great and Awful on One CD,"The first two tracks on this cd are sublime, soulful, blue-inflected jazz masterworks. Then comes the New Orleans style dirge, which is nice, but not nearly as striking as the first two pieces. THEN comes the sermon.I suppose the concept of the sermon as part of the flow - the death of the blues, sermon, then ressurection - has its merit, in theory. I'm sure Wynton thought it very clever. But it is about sixteen minutes long. It is pompous and silly. When it first begins, it comes off as campy, perhaps an enjoyable diversion. About five minutes into it, however, it makes me want to scream.This is like listening to a performance of Brahm's German Requiem with one of the tracks performed by Alvin and the Chimpmunks, or listening to Maria Callas with Garth Brooks breaking in for sixteen minutes as a backup singer. Track four is very nearly unforgivable. However, I have kept the cd for the strength of the first two. It's worth owning, I suppose, if you know what you're in for."
2,Wish I'd read these other reviews...,"...before I bought this disc. Tracks 1, 2, 3, and 5 are all prime Wynton, but that sermon absolutely wrecks this album for me. Even the value of the other pieces can't overcome the puerile delivery of that campy melodrama. There are a lot of great Marsalis discs out there...start with BIG TRAIN, for instance. Leave this one alone."
3,Bad programing not bad music,I understand what my fellow reviewers are saying about the fact that this album doesn't quiet flow with the long sermon breaking things up. However I disagree that the sermon is a bad piece in and of itself. I myself was inspired by the message of the speech. The backgorund music adds even more meaning to the themes presented by Stanly Crouch.
3,I liked it just fine but the handle broke after six months,For the money it was fine. I'd still use it if it had a handle. I couldn't believe it snapped off. I don't know if that was just a fluke or a general product flaw. Your mileage may vary.
5,Fits 2004 Lesabre,Replaced the rear air shocks in my 2004 Buick Lesabre and these were the correct replacement mounts that I needed to complete the job.
3,Not terrible.,"This is a good starting point book and/or a reference book. Let's be honest... we're not going to learn how to shoot a film just by reading a book on cinematography. Experience is the best way to learn, which is largely how I learned how to shoot film.This book will provide you with a lot of technical information, which is why I slated it as a good reference book. Little things about color temperature, filters, film speeds, lenses, etc. There are some useful diagrams and photographs in the book, and it is kind of ""matter of factly"" written.I give it only three stars because though it is a decent book... its competitor ""Cinematography: Theory and Practice"" by Brown is much more informative, much better written and organized, and perhaps the most important, has a myriad film stills as reference."
1,This book was a waste of money.,"After taking the Server & Workstation Core exams with a combination of the MS Press books and this series, I was all set for some good assistance with the Exchange book from this publisher. I was extremely disappointed by the content of this book.Not only is the book very short on information in several key areas, it also lacks any significant coverage of exam essentials like clients. The small overview given of clients is not enough to prepare someone for the exam.As if the lack of essentials wasn't enough, the book is incorrect in at least one exam question! In a question regarding trust levels, this book is in direct conflict with Microsoft's own Exchange Server 5.5 book. That was in the Chapter 2 exam. It's anyone's guess what other nuggets like that one are awaiting the reader in this book.I wish I could say that I'm going to buy another book in this series for my last exam, but after this fiasco I'm not going to give them any more of my money."
2,TOO much resumed,I used this guide to take my exam and failed. I liked the 2 minutes drill at the end of each chapter and the fact it was fast (too fast?) to read. But it positively HAS NOT enough informations to prepare Exchange exam and the questions are too easy compare to what the exam asks. I worked much more hours with my MS courses books and using blank exams and then succeeds. I do not recommend for people preparing the exams and I do not see other valuable usages.
4,Very thorough book - I passed with it!,"I was very pleased with the quality and depth of this book. The previous submitter appears to be a little off here... Considering the CD that comes with the book contains many many exam questions, I think I can live with a 'typo'. But, isn't that what we call a first edition? I haven't found a book yet that didn't have a typographical error or two. A quality book that, combined with hands on experience and NT Server knowledge will prepare you completely for the Exchange 5.5 server exam."
4,4 1/2 stars,"Neal has never been a singer, but im my opion he is the best guitarist, in the world, bar none. One would expect an instrumental cd from Neal, and that is what I was hoping for with this cd, but it's not what I got. I was very pleased. Neal plays the guitar with a firery passion, that would take a great vocalist to match him, and not to be overshadowed by him. Neal for the most part Neal's vocals are overshadowed, but not consumed by his playing. And for some reason this only adds to the music.Late Nite and Softly are the outstanding tracks on this cd, and the rest are not far behind. The music feels heart felt and not by the numbers, like some of Journey's later songs."
5,looking to replace this one for the third time,"i bought the cassette of this in 1989 while in the military. I have played it endlessly over the course of 10 years. This is THE BEST mood cd. Good for relaxing, winding down, or sharing with that special someone. I cant say enough how much the music on this title has meant to me."
1,These batteries are defective,"Amazon.com has now sent me two of these batteries, and both are defective. The first battery would jump from a nearly full charge to a 1% charge, causing my laptop to shutdown in the middle of presentations, etc. This second battery, even fully charged, stops delivering current altogether, causing my laptop to abruptly shut off completely.My a20p has been a reliable work companion for four years, until I purchased one of these batteries. It is now for the first time wholly unreliable. I am returning these batteries, and will purchase an OEM model from IBM."
2,"Exciting subject, dismal translation","The author of this book attempted to tackle a very interesting subject but, to the English-language readership's chagrin, did not seem to bother to have the English-language edition of the presumably Dutch original either translated into proper English or proof-read. The result is a linguistic hodge-podge which precludes any kind of meaningful reading. Trying to decipher what the author is trying to say is often an extremely frustrating experience. This book has shocked and saddened me."
1,Shame its incomplete AGAIN....?,"Shame my Favorite Track from First-Light is missing as Allways...? Explain the Reasons ????? The Track thats missing acctually called "" Explain the Reasons "" ....? 1982/83 12 inch Version incl. instrumental Version only avail. from Original 12 inch Record ...?

1,Do not buy these bulbs,Do not buy these bulbs they are not what you think. I purchase a pair & they only lasted me 9 mouths. What a waste of money. PIAA my only be good for sponsorship. Try to buy hella before PIAA that's my opinion. Do not buy PIAA.
1,Poor Quality,The bulbs preformed well while they lasted. The bulbs burned out after 6 months of use. I've had other (much cheaper) brands of bulbs last up to 4 years! PIAA does not back their warranty and the customer service is horrible. I gave up on trying to get them to back their product and bought a different brand. I would stay away from any and all PIAA products.
2,DO NOT BUY THIS BULB!,"I bought these off of tire rack for $73 plus shipping. $82 total. RIP OFF. I had DOT Approved $15 lights that outshined these EXPENSIVE bulbs by a wide margin. The low beams are a nice color of white. NOT Purple/Blue. Plus, it is not very BRIGHT. Not as bright as my old cheap bulbs. The high beams are also White, not blue at all. I was really excited about these ""high performance"" bulbs, but it was all hype. Packaging, marketing, high price, make them seem ""better"" than the rest. They DON'T look anything like real HID's. Anyone who would confuse the two must be blind, or just retarded. DO NOT BUY. You have been warned."
3,PIAA H4 Super Plasma GT-X Bulb,"This bulb does not live up to its hype. Yes, it is brighter than my stock bulb, but not by much. PIAA tells you that this bulb is double the output of a standard bulb, but it definitely is not twice as bright. I wouldn't replace a perfectly good bulb with this one, but if my regular bulb burned out and I needed a replacement, I might consider it."
3,Not as bright as I thought they would be!,"I wanted to replace my sealed beams for some really bright bulbs that would light up the night. I bought some IPF lenses and the Super Plasma GT-X bulbs. I was expecting a huge improvment. I am not blaming the IPF lenses just the bulbs themselves.I still find myself straining to see deer or other little furry creatures on or near the road. I actually hit a deer a couple of weeks ago, while in low beam.I have them adjusted correctly, and I am just not impressed with the light output."
1,DONT BUY THESE BULBS!,worst bulb ive ever owned. the color is cool but they dont light up the road worth a dam! they burnt out within about 9months
3,disappointingly slight,"I was not impressed with this book on either a spiritual or artistic level. The spiritual exercises were obvious and thin, and the dolls themselves didn't do much for me. I didn't learn much from this book. Perhaps my expectations were too high because I was hoping for something similar to Cassandra Light's _Way of the Doll_. I did think that some of the exercises and dolls would be useful for a class or group where you didn't want to go into too much detail on either the dollmaking or spiritual exercises. In particular, some of the paper dolls techniques were nice and would be easy to do for people without a strong craft background. A beginner to crafts or spiritual exercises might get more from this than I did."
2,Someone what I was looking for.,"This is not a book on how to make plush dolls; this is a book on how to make jointed paperdolls. The ideas for embellishment are OK, but all in all I was dissapointed. I was looking for a more creative stuffed doll book.Some of the patterns were very nice, however, if you're looking for paper doll patterns or for pleasant looking faces. Many of the patterns, with a little adjustment, can be made into a plush doll. The book did have a very nice weaving technique, though.Also, the 'spiritual excersizes' leave a lot to be desired. To me, they seemed to be how a non-Wicca person sees Wicca. Too much emphasis was placed on the dolls and the person creating them for healing purposes.This is one book any library won't weep without."
4,Worlds Navies on CD,This publication is an American equivalent of Janes Fighting Ships.I personally like the CD version as it has a good index facility and fairly good photos and illustrations with plenty of information about every navy particularly of the minor vessels. More illustrations would be useful but you cannot have every thing. Overall I like this product and keep it loaded on my laptop.
3,"Good value, but already badly out of date in places","Combat Fleets convincingly beats its only real rival (Janes Fighting Ships) on price, but loses marks on the accuracy and currency of some of the information that it contains. I'm puzzled what was being done between the originally advertised publication date (May 2004?) and the actual February 2005 date. For much of this edition, it would appear that the entries were last reviewed and revised as long ago as 2003, or at best early 2004, and the opportunity to insert recent pictures or graphics for at least major classes and projects has not been taken."
1,CUTE DEPRESSION-ERA FLUFF - BUT LOUSY ALPHA DVD!,BEWARE! This is another way-below-par release from ALPHA. You'd be better off saving your cash and watching it on YOUTUBE!
1,I can't use it on my computer,"I can't use it on my computer, I didn't realize that when I bought it, but I have Windows 7."
3,Photo Pro Deluxe,"This is a great program but can not get it to work with windows 7 ,64 bit.Wish there was a way as I really love this simple but detailed little program.It does it all and does it without a lot of fuss and easy to use."
3,Tis no vice squad......,"Hmm....what do we have here? Why it's the front lead of Vice Squad doing covers...It's always a little dangerous for anyone to do a whole album of covors. And Beki proves why this a taboo thing to do. Cold Turkey was a demo Beki had done and it's a pretty damned good cover of John Lennons song. So, one could see why Disoriente was interested picking Beki up. Yet, songs like ""Son of a Preacher Man, Foxy Lady"" ect are just plain flat terrible. Do you like boys back in town song slow and dragging? Unless you're a huge fan of Beki Bondage I recommend one stays away from this and buy either some Vice Squad or if you like female fronted punk bands try the Violators or Action Pact instead of picking this up."
3,Review Islamic Theology,"A well-written book on the relationship between 'rationalists' and 'traditionalists' in classical Islam. The author writes about the function of reason in both types of Muslim scholars, and the use of it in theological discourse. He depends on some not so much used works on theology from scholars such as Abu'l-Qasim al-Taymi, and Ibn Taymiyyah, whose Dar al-Ta'arrud al-'Aql wa'l-Naql (Removing the Contradictionary Nature between Reason and Tradition) is an important source on the subject. In the appendix the author of the book translates texts from Ibn Abi Hatim al-Razi, al-Baqillani, and Qadi Abd al-Jabbar on theology."
3,Promising,"Listening to this cd you can obviously tell that it is the bands first. The production value is kinda shoddy but its cool because its not OVERproduced, like many cds today. Its clean and crisp sounding, which is good, but their could have been a better job balancing the volume of the vocals and guitar and stuff like that, which is commonplace for a rookie band. If you like 12 stones, new papa roach, and that ""melodic altmetal style"", you will love these guys, enough said. The reason that they only get 3 stars is because they are too generic sounding. They sound as if they listened to what was selling and what was on the radio and modelled themselves entirely after it. The band has no signature style, you won't here them and say ""OH! Thats Pressure 4-5!"" you'll instead say, ""Hey this sounds really familiar but I don't know who it is."" If Pressure 4-5 can find their niche and develop a signature style, they are destined for greatness."
3,"Good, not fast enough","... I bought it, because I was very impressed with their single, ""Beat the World."" What I found was somewhat dissapointing. I thought more of it would be upbeat like that, but they are all slow and melodic. The only songs that really impressed me were ""Beat the World,"" ""Into Yesterday,"" ""These Hands,"" and ""Pieces."" Still, 8 dollars for four good songs and planty of filler isnt too much, is it?"
2,IRONIC?,Sounds like every other cd that a teenager would have: you can tell these guys don't really care about their music by seeing that they all have pretty boy pics. Become a model; not a musician.
4,One of the very few new good bands...,This CD reminds me of what I loved about Helmet. Better than most everything else new out there.
2,Generic Garbage!,"DONT BUY IT. Some of the songs are not that bad, but trust me...you will not be glad you bought this album. The songs are all boring and depressing and really...pointless. This is just the same boring, depressing, nu metal garbage [I.E. Drowning Pool] and you will be sick of it before you finish listening to the cd.This cd would be much better if it was a little heaver, more music, and less singing. The thing that mostly gets me down about this band is the lead singer, he goes a overboard with his type of singing. His low, depressed, MONOTONE DRONING ruines the music and makes you want to kill yourself on some of the tracks. I think if he screamed a little more and changed his voice more often instead of having the same level voice all the time, the album would be much better."
2,2 Stars for 2 Good songs....,"Pressure 4-5 is just another Nu-Metal band trying to get popular with the kiddies. At least they don't rap like most nu-metal which I Completely dispise. I heard ""Beat the world"" On the radio, of course, and also saw it on MTV2 a few times. Well, I thought it would be great, Beat the World is a good song, but the rest of the CD is just terrible, Its only like 35 minutes long, all the songs sound the same, they are boring, uninteresting, redundant, and badly written. Sometimes the lyrics don't make any sense whatsoever. ""Into Yesterday"" Is the other song i liked. Just download those 2 songs off Morpheus or winMX and you have the cd, because the rest is filler. If you are looking for some good music that is similar to this, check out Cold - 13 Ways to bleed on stage, Staind - Dysfunction, and Taproot - Gift."
2,They have a long way to come,"I was excited about the release of Pressure 4-5's debut album. Everyone was comparing them to the likes of Incubus and I thought ""Great, a new band that isn't horrible,"" and believe me, P4-5 is FAR from horrible, but they just aren't much to write home about. The vocals are probably the thing that killed it for me. The guy's voice is so dry and monotone and he sounds the same in every song. It gets very tiresome after 4 or 5 songs... The music on here is pretty good sounding, the band has talent, and you can tell, but that vocalist, I swear... Overall, this is the better side of all the nu-metal debuts this year, but they have a long way to come and a lot of practicing in their future."
5,Guess What I Think!?,"OK, first off, I didn't even know what Pressure 4-5 looked like when I heard this amazing song over AOL radio called, ""Beat The World"" and asked anyone if they had heard of this band called Pressure 4-5. No one had any idea who I was talking about so I decided to buy the CD. I was in shock the second it began. I was in love with the CD 45 minutes later. Yet, here, whenever people ask what bands I like and I mention Pressure 4-5, I get blank stares. So, no one really knows who they are where I live, so I can't say they are sellouts. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes strong lyrics with hard rock and emo tones blended together to make this CD. It is one of my most played ones."
5,Tiffany Rocks,"Tiffany is back and boy does she ROCK. Her new CD is worth getting. Her new sound compares to that of Alanis Morisette or Sheryl Crow. There are several rockin songs on the Color of Silence CD, as well as the beautiful ballad ""If Only"". The song ""Open My Eyes"" is fabulous, definitely one of my favorites on the CD. If you are looking for another great female artist, this is the one to get."
3,Medium,"""I'm not sleeping"" is surely not a bad effort. When I listen to the radio it is a rather pleasant surprise to hear this song. But still, I heard about Tiffany's return to the music business a few months ago and was pretty interested in her new material. And after all, I am pretty disappointed with such a medium result like ""I'm not sleeping"". I expected something unique and refreshing. It is also not the best idea to promote by stating that it sounds like Alanis Morisette, where is the uniqueness?"
4,The Dershowitz segment on Supreme Court involvement in Presidential election of 2000,"Dershowitz comes out accusing. He states that the Supreme Court in involving itself in regard to the disputed ballots in the Florida election acted improperly. The Court as he understands this acts generally on cases which have general application and are not simply unique instances. He accuses five justices of violating their own lifelong habit and practice to see that George W. Bush and not Al Gore become President. Justices Rehnquist, Thomas, Alioto, O'Connor, Stewart are faulted. What disturbs him above all is the violation of the delicate constitutional mechanisms by which U.S. democracy functions.Again I have no real personal understanding of these kinds of legal issues. Dershowitz is however clear, forceful and convincing. Charlie Rose does not really take him in, offer strong arguments to the contrary."
2,Disappointing,"This book came highly recommended by a source I respect, so I was surprised to find it boring. I would have been better off reading a biography of Siegfried Sassoon, and something on treatment for shell shock in WWI. The most interesting character for me was Rivers, but by the end of the book I still knew little about him. Most unsatisfactory, I had little interest in finishing this book and certainly won't be bothering with the sequels."
5,For the series,"I read the trilogy a few years ago after seeing it on the front page of amazon.uk. I had a grandfather who was in the great war. He was gassed. He later committed suicide in the front room of his house by refusing food. We don't talk about it much. I am disturbed when I think of this war shattered man who I am related to over a gap of 50 years.I found this series uplifting, sad, funny and enjoyable. I felt that I understood more about my family - what happened to us and why. The prose is wonderous, the dialog good enough that you feel suspended in the room or on the battle field with these people, just as if you were behind the furniture or sitting in the trench nearby. Its about poetry, rebellion and death. Its about the horror of this world. Also it is about being human."
4,Leaves you eager to read the next two books in the trilogy.,"After seeing a preview of the film version of this novel, I picked up a copy and began to read. While the story is insular--almost claustrophic--in its setting, it is nevertheless gripping. The characters, especially Dr. Rivers, are sympathetic. I'm disappointed to hear that the two succeeding novels are of lesser quality!"
2,Regeration touches on interesting issues but has many faults,"Regeneration on the whole is not what I would call a great book. It touches quickly on some interesting issues but only deals and looks at them fleetingly. As well, it keeps on trying to drive home cliched and over done points such as ""war has a great cost to society"". It is confusing to read as it switches constantly between characters without giving you any idea that it has switched. Much of the book leaves you wondering what the point of any of it is. There is no real plot, no real thrust to any of it. You don't really care too much for any of the characters. The whole thing left me rather cold. If it was more coherent I would be much more pleased with it. As well, the book annoyingly blurs the line between fact and fiction, so you are left with the belief you have read something based on fact, but it is hard to discern what is factual and what is not."
2,Absurdly Overrated Fluff,"Absurdly overrated, and I am wondering what kind of bigwig muckety-muck connections Ms. Barker has in the publishing industry which allows for such mediocre material to receive such propagandistic hooplah.It is written adequately enough for a psychological novel, sure; however, as a chronicle of WAR it fails miserably: there is precious little of the dirt and grit of war, just a lot of fluff from someone who has obviously never experienced it first hand. Barker should stick to something she knows, something she's actually experienced. She gives the reader so little concrete detail here: One or two pages of ""Homage to Catalonia"" by Orwell, or ""A Farewell to Arms"" by Hemingway, are worth far more than this entire light-weight book in providing the reader with a real glimpse into war and a soldier's thoughts."
2,Extremely overrated,"I was so looking forward to this read, and equally disappointed. The male characters (with one notable exception) don't seem to live and breathe, and are a sketchy set of characteristics and tics. The one exception (and not a surprise, considering the author's former work) is a working class Northern woman involved with one of the main characters. Since the characters are not particularly involving and the milieu and era is not brought vividly to life, the book reads as a schematic, rather than a flesh-and-blood, fully realized work of art."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"Well, looks as if I'm a lone wolf concerning these books, and now I know why I had never heard of Pat Barker. I read about a book a week and I am so upset that I wasted my time on these. If you're looking for literature that gives you some insight about World War I, you shouldn't waste your time and money either. There is so much worthwhile literature out there. I must say that a lot of times I am quite disappointed in Booker Prize winners. ((What were they thinking?)"
4,Regeneration,"By MollieI thought this book was really good. I got attached to the characters and I wanted to read more about them and what happened to them!I thought that Dr. Rivers was an especially interesting character, and it was my favorite part of the book, reading about all of his changes. As we discussed in class today, the book is about Seigfried Sassoon but you can observe monumental changes in Rivers. As he tries to rehabilitate his patients, he learns things from them and through them, changes himself.I also liked that pat barker brought up the subject of bonds between men during the war, and all the men that realized that war wasn't really a manly experience, they actually ended up gaining more feminine qualities, nurturing and taking care of each other, and the other psychological effects of the war that you wouldn't normally think about.I definitely recommend this book and I want to read the rest of the trilogy.By Mollie Little"
3,Disturbing,"This is the first in a crisply written trilogy of novels woven around WWI trench soldiers and the doctor that treats them when they come home shell-shocked. One of Dr. Rivers' patients is Sassoon who takes a stand on the moral status of the war and it's continuance. Given that it is better to be thought lunatic than a pacifist Sassoon's friends pull strings to see that he is treated instead of court-martialed. His arrival at Craiglockhart introduces us to a startling variety of damaged soldiers, their ailments, the treatments, and their futures, which we follow in the next two books: The Eye in the Door, and The Ghost Road. Grisley. Disturbing. Graphic sex. I am still undecided as to whether or not I recommend these books."
5,this is an ESSENTIAL!,"Having first bought The Wild Places years ago when it first came out, I still find that this music SPEAKS even better to me now than it did back then! I swear, Dan has rewritten the lyrics so they continue to apply to me and my life path! I am still referring new people to this cd, in the hope of sharing all his messages. Both the words & the music are AWESOME! He has captured so many of the important things in life....SPIRIT, love, and of course NATURE, and the mountains & sea are blended in a way that they are ONE.....My heartfelt thanks to DAN.....keep it up...i quote you often!"
3,Has its moments,"This one's a little different. In many ways, I like it, and it's certainly far superior to River of Souls. But... there's a brash quality to the production that's a bit hard on the ears, and Fogelberg's (creditable, don't get me wrong) ""thing"" about the native people and the environment and all that... well, does it make the best material for music? You don't always want to be that serious and worthy.But if you do want to be serious, this album has some good tunes (as always) and Dan's vocals are nicely matured. Oddly, my favourite track is probably ""Rhythm of the Rain"", simply because he sings it so wonderfully. Bones in the Sky is good too, and Anastasia's eyes... though he sings them in a very slightly tortured way that I could do without."
4,The Wild Places,I am a big Dan Fogelberg fan and didn't buy this until recently. I really like the songs on the CD. Just really sad we lost such a talented artist too soon.
5,just what I needed,Yep- exactly what I needed- another 2000 bullet for a remote control tank to be shot around my iving room. Perfect. But the pouring spout is very well designed.
5,Great,These came fairly quickly. Please note that the bbs are green( I didn't really care what color they were). These work flawlessly
3,They are BB's,"They are BB's, and cheap. What else do you want? Not completely smooth, but shot out fine. Good for all but the pro's."
3,okay,"these are okay bbs they make my gun jam some times though, but is have a unjammer that would be good"
3,Crossman Airsoft bbs 0.12,"They do what they are supposed to, have a pretty good quality, very good for using with low fps airsoft guns, but if you are looking for bbs for a 300 fps+ I would recommend u to check something like this insteadTSD Competition Grade 6mm plastic airsoft BBs, 0.20g, 5000 rds, white"
5,The best,These bb's are the best.Not even one has ever jammed on me.You can also reuse these bbs.Just pick the bbs and gently blow the dirt off.This also hides better in grass then orange or white bbs.Prosdoesn't jamreuseablehides in the grass in day timeConIn the dark you can sort of see the bbs
4,"Where is ""Sunny Side of the street""?","I was glad to get the soundtrack, but was sooo disappointed when Bunny Brigg's solo was left off the CD. That cut was one of the reasons I purchased the CD! To me, ""Sunny side of the street"" is almost a theme for the movie, sung by someone IN the movie. Beside that, I loved it!"
4,The best soundtrack ever,"I actually was 9 thru 11 when I heard this be4 I seen the movie TAP or rightafter with the late Gregory Hines (RIP). All the songs are Amazing but the 1's I dug are Teena Marie's ""Bad Boy"", Gregory Hines' ""Can't Stand the Rhythm"", Stanley Clarke's ""Max's Theme"" (bad bass here! and really good sounds and techniques off the track). TAP will stand along as my favorite movie in history 'cuz that's when I got inspired to do music and stuff. I still have recorded on blank tape awhile back since '94 or '95. Still will purchase the orignal tape + the CD version ASAP. RIP to my man and favorite actor Gregory Hines for a wonderful job and a Great legacy he left us. A Must."
4,Radio Radio Radio,"When I first heard this album, I was kind of dissapointed with the reggae, and the poppiness of the whole thing. I mean how could Tim top anything after Op Ivy? But after listenting to it a couple of times, it grew on me and it shows how much more diverse Rancid's sound is and that they aren't afraid of something new. I cannot wait until their next album, to check out how their new sound has developed!"
1,cassette tape,in the description it said nothing about it being a cassette tape . I bought It thinking it was a cd because it never said other wise and normally when you buy music now days its because its a cd. When I opened the box I was completely shocked and irritated that it came to me as a cassette tape. I do not have a cassette player so it was wasted time and money I will never buy from here again
5,"Good Game, A Must Have for Dog Lovers","Hi! My interest in petz started when we recived dogz1 as a sort of bonus for buying a Hewlet Packard printer. As it turned out, I later wanted Dogz3(4 wasn't out yet). After a hundred petz, lots of downloads and about a year, Dogz 4 came out and I got it. Dogz 4 is wonderful, though downloads are sparse. Though I love dogs, not cats, I am contomplating getting Catz4,so I have the whole package. I think dogz4 will be best if you don't already have dogz3,but it is still good. PS:Also,you should know that the voice thing doesn't work."
2,Fun but gets old quickly,"This game was the first I got for the computer. It seemed cool on the box, and when I installed it it was fun.......for about 3 days. I had no problems installing it. The main upset was that I couldn't just bring them on the desktop and surf the internet or do work in the word prcessor with the dog(s). Plus, there were numerous bugs such as missing costumes and the fact that my dog refused to drink out of the water bowl. All he would do is carry it in his mouth and bark. Another thing, they say that when your female gets pregnant, which did happen, she would get fat and less hungry and lazy. Although my Bulldog napped and didn't eat as much she stayed as thin as ever. I also had problems with the puppy ageing. When I got it from the vet it aged fast, however when I breeded one, it took almost 5 months (human time) for it to go through its stages, not including pregnency. Untill these people come out with more and get the bugs worked out save your money."
4,really cool!,"I love Dogz 4! Playing with the little puppies is so much fun! the graphics are really neat, and the part I really like is raising puppies from newborns! You can even make your own playscenes for your dogz to play in!I reccomend this item if you are a dog lover!"
2,Don't Waste Your Money.,I bought Dogz 4 not too long ago and I got bored with it real fast. Mindscape aims the program to younger audiences. Who the heck wans to take their Dogz to Arabia or the West? It's a total waste of money and I can't bear to see someone pay 30 bucks on this! It is definately not worth it@!
3,"Good, but some of the funnest accsesories got lost","This one is very fun, in the sense that you can teach your dogz how to do tricks and commands, and that you can dress them in more cultural costumes, but, I expected more. I heard that you could bring out three dogs at a time in this one, but you can't! Sometimes there are three dogs, but one of them you cant keep; it's a tour guide! Also, once, my screen froze so I had to turn the computer off, and now my sled , snake, cannon, and coconuts are gone!"
4,Not much different from Dogz 3,"I got Dogz 3 about 2 years ago and I was instantly hooked, I plaed it almost every day and created a couple fansites. Now Im 14 and in highschool I gave up petz 3 long ago. I gave away the CD and deleted all my petz related stuff off the computer. I recently got dogz 4 for christmas, It's a fun game and the dogz are hilarious to play with, but its isnt much different from dogz 3. I havnt tryed the voice recignition thing yet but i hear it doesnt work very well. ...its fun to do and everything but petz does get boring fast. Its a wonderful game for younger kids though."
3,"Enjoyable at first, but","Children will get quite a kick out of this game continually playing with the dogs on a daily basis. As an adult though, at first it will seem cute having the dogs mate with one another to see what the puppies will look like. All in all if you have a children it is a gem, for adults, though I would pass on this one.Also one of the annoying points is that the microphone is extremely hard to work if it ever works at all. If you are set on buying a Dogz game, stick with Dogz III, has no mike and is cheaper."
4,Dogz4,"This is a great game. It is educational, beacause it teaches you responsibility, and its fun. I think people from about 7-12 would enjoy it. It doesn't crash your computer apart from the screen saver, but occasionally it does not run. I have Catz 5 too now, and I personally think it's better, but that may just be cos I don't have a real cat :-)."
2,A fun game that is not reality,This game can be fun. However if you are a person looking for a game that is close to reality this is not the right game. There is such a difference between having a real pet and this computer game. I don't recomend this game because I don't feel that it is worth the money. Maybe I feel this way because I have a really puppy that I love.
2,Boring...,"It's pretty exciting the first few MINUTES you get it, but after a quick few minutes it gets very boring. One major problem with video games it that they get boring. Be sure to get one that actaully has you wanting you to get back on and continue."
4,so so book,This is actually a decent book. It goes into the technical side of it along with the skill levels required for each different type of drift. Most of the information in this book will be realized with practice anyway. I do believe you could obtain the same skill level without tearing up as many tires :op.
4,drills,"More drills than I ever could use, but the instruction regarding techniques and strategy was good."
3,Would be an Awesome Record/Band,"This would be an awesome record/band if the singer wasn't so bad. I'm being honest. I'am a huge fan of 70's rock, it's all I listen to. I'm in love with the music, but you still have to have a good singer. The music on this cd is cool, but the singing makes the whole cd worthless and un-listenable. Be cautious. If you need good singing to enjoy the rest trust me this cd is not worth your time. 3 stars for guitar work."
4,A lot of fun,"Nice fat-70s hard rock. Lots of big, slow, crushing, Sabbath-like riffs. Singer has a monster baritone. Great party music. Plus-my favorate part-it's on VERTIGO.Play loud. Enjoy/"
2,Didn't like this one,"Darn, I was looking forward to trying a different story from Rankin. I could not get into this one even though I tried more than once. There are many characters and the story tries to get started but never really takes off."
2,Decent but Derivative,"This is a decently written and constructed combination police procedural and thriller. The basic plot device is the discovery that a skilled solo assassin has infiltrated into Britain, probably with the intention of killing a prominent international leader at a major conference. The story follows the assassin in parallel with the efforts of security agencies to catch her. Older readers will recognize the story line from Frederick Forsythe's Day of the Jackal, published about 30 years ago. If you like Witch Hunt, you should read Forsythe's book, which is signicantly better. Even better, rent or buy a copy of the superior movie version starring Edward Fox and directed by the talented Fred Zinneman. A warning, the movie version should not be confused with a more recent and godawful Hollywood remake titled The Jackal, starring the inexcrable Bruce Willis."
5,Fantastic Fun,"Hilarious! This is one of the best books for Children and Adults alike as it manages to entertain on many levels.There is a great mixture of new and more traditional stories which I never got bored of reading.Favourites include ""The Stowaways"" and ""Handsel and Gristel"" as well as ""The Guest who ran away"".It doesn't matter where you open the book, you can always find something to amuse you."
1,Borrrrrrinnnnnnngggg!!!!!,"Hi well to start this book stinks!! I thought I was gong to like it but I really didn't. This book is boring, dull, And all the other words that mean the same thing. I didn't finish it cause it was so boring. But I did like the stowaways. Overall this book is boring I really didn't like it if you want a real laugh read more funny stories well gotta go hope this was helpful Brooke."
2,Semi happy,"Product arrived in good condition, within a week the legs all broke off of the spider. So not very good quality."
3,Somewhat Outdated Book,"The version of the book that I bought was written in 1983 and is somewhat outdated. Many new types of lighting are not included (T8 flourescent, T5 flourescent, LED, etc.). Also this book is entirely in black & white, so in discussions of color topics, such as the Munsell Color System, black & white illustrations don't make sense.However for learning the basics it is OK."
3,Good Vaccum - Odd Shape,I recently purchased the Denali Bare-Tool cordless vacuum. I primarily wanted it for my car. It has good suction power however its odd nose shape makes it dificult to get down on the sides of my seats or in tight places. I need to find a hose extension or possibly purchase a completely different vacuum.
1,Noisiest razor ever,"This thing is loud, really loud. I did realize how quite my old Norelco rotary razor was until I turned on the Remington. The noise is only the first problem. The trimmer button is so poorly placed that your thumb accidentally hits it while shaving. Speaking of shaving, this unit falls short in that department also. I found myself going back to my old safety razor to touch up areas the Remington could not handle. After using this thing for a week I put it in the box and ordered new heads for my Norelco."
3,"A fine razor, but are there better?","I got this this model about a year ago for father's day, over 6 months ago. This has been a fine razor, but I think maybe there are better out there.This unit provided a very close shave, especially early on. Lately the quality of the shave has fallen off and it has required more passes to complete a shave. I think the manual said to replace the screens every 6 months, which I imagine would bring the shave back to its original level. Just recently, part of the screen broke and gave me a very small scratch. I was able to bend it back in and continue using the razor. Replacing screens so frequently is disappointing, my old Norelco would go with a set of blades for longer and I never got scratched.Contrary to a previous reviewers experience, my unit does work while charging."
3,Remington Shaver,"I purchased mine at a department store a few months ago at a close out sale. For me the shaver has given quite a close shave, though I do have to pass by more than once. One problem has been the battery's inability to hold a charge (3 to 4 shaves with a sudden stop when it runs out of charge. A Braun shaver I own goes for about a week between charges. The other concern has been the need to replace a screen after too short a period of use.Compared to the Braun, the Remington is noisier, provides a closer shave, less convenient in holding a charge, but more convenient in that the shaver itself can be plugged in to charge where the Braun requires a charging stand, and the Remington apparently goes through screens more quickly."
4,Vinpocetine is Vinpocetine,"This book clearly explains the use of Vinpocetine (VinpocetineRX), from the early stages of the Perwinkle plant to the first stage of extraction called Vincamine and finally to Vinpocetine. ClubNatural.com manufactures Vinpocetine in the US under the VinpocetineRX name.Great Job Dr. Ley"
1,Vinpocetine can cause depression by depleting dopamine and other neurotransmitters,"Vinpocetine inhibits IKK preventing I'B degradation and the following translocation of NF-'B to the cell nucleus. Increases in neuronal levels of DOPAC, a metabolic breakdown product of dopamine, have been shown to occur in striatal isolated nerve endings as a result of exposure to vinpocetine.Such an effect is consistent with the biogenic pharmacology of reserpine, a structural relative of vinpocetine, which depletes catecholamine levels and causes depression as a side effect of the cardiovascular and anti-psychotic effects.[15] However, this effect tends to be reversible upon cessation of Vinpocetine administration, with full remission typically occurring within 3-4 weeks.Anecdotal evidence confirms this dopmaine depletion leading to low energy, difficulty focusing, loss of drive, ambition, etc.I would try gingko or rhodiola for memory or brain enhancement.[...]"
5,ROY857,THERE IS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WHAT IS SMOOTH JAZZ. DAM!!!!!!! THIS IS IT. JUST FOR YOU ARE YOU AND YOUR LADY. CHILL TIME IS BACK.
3,Outdoor cabinet,"I purchased this cabinet to hold my outdoor stereo system.It is kind of flimsy and I had to use some self tapping screws to make sure it would stay together outside in the weather, I also had to drill some drain holes so the water that gets in when it raines would drain out.This product would have been better if the box would have been designed as one piece with the door.It also needs an inside shelf so you can actually put things in it, and I will be trying to use a silicon glue to seal it.Would not recomend this to friends."
4,"Very Informative, But Too Technical","This book is a long-overdue tribute to a much and unfairly maligned operatic genius of classical Italian music, who was one of Beethoven's teachers. The book contains not only a Salieri biography, but a detailed history of the opera in to Salieri's day and rightly regards him as the successor of Gluck's reform operas. The major fault of the book is that it will appeal mainly to musicians and musical historians rather than the general reader due to its over-technical nature with regard to some areas. Still, the best book about Salieri's life and art."
5,MY BRA,"I LOVE IT!! IT MAKE ME FEEL GOOD AND CONFORTABLE.I WANT MORE OF THEM, VERY SOFT, AND BEAUTIFULL, I LOVE IT!!!!!"
4,Finally... something new and exciting,"The video for ""Shh... (Hope Diggy)"" sparked my interest enough in this band to go see what they had released and pick up a copy. Unfortunately, their full length won't be released until next month, but I did get to pick up this 5-song EP. I was definitely impressed. The middle eastern vibe is here, along with great meaty guitars, weird time signatures, and impressive vocals. My top picks on this album are ""Bullshed"" and ""4RA's"". The only reason this cd didn't get 5 stars is because the last song, ""Trust Ease"" didn't really grab me lyrically or musically. (""...ignorant easter suit"" just doesn't seem to make any sense to me) All in all though, The Apex Theory is an amazing new band and I am very excited about the release of their full length album, ""Topsy-Turvy"". Buy this EP and support this band!"
5,"Support The Apex Theory, buy this EP","I have been lucky enough to have seen The Apex Theory perform on the SnoCore tour, having never heard of them before, i became and instant addict to their medterranian rock vibes.I purchased this EP at the concert, and i bought another copy a week later, one for my house, one for work.I have also pre-ordered their soon to be released album Topsy Turvy, coming in early April.from one show, i was hooked and i highly recomend this album to anybody, any age, any musical taste.\/\/"
1,Yechh,The whole genre of 311-rap-raga-spazz-punk-funk is bogus and these guys are the poseurs of the lot. Wake me when you learn how to rock. Next!
4,nippy morning,"as I was strawling from my lake side log cabin on a clear spring morning to the car through a small wood, with my ghetto blaster hanging from my shoulder, I pushed the play buttton of the thing and clear crisp sounds ofchristmas filled the air with breath taking touch wich anyone within thehearing distance was welcome to enjoy..."
4,Beautiful music for Christmas season,I found myself listening to this CD over and over again during the holidays. Highlight was hearing the amazing harmonies in the duet with Tyne Daly on In the Bleak Midwinter. I know these are not her most recent songs but they are classics and her take on them is very ethereal and evokes so many moods that come with the season in a way that only Judy can. It's now one of my favorites.
4,Enjoyable read if you take it for what it is.,"A good book that tries to link historical evidence to Biblical events and stories. Please understand that it was written in 1956 so all of the evidence is not based on the most recent scientific methods or archeological discoveries. It also is a ""history"" book so it stays clear of mystical and miraculous proof for events. It does not denigrate these events though."
1,Not the original book - Cheap rip-off,"This edition by BN Publishing is a cheap, unauthorized copy of the original book. It is missing most of the photos and tables that make the book great. The other reviews are written about the original book and not this edition. My son needed the book for a class. Unfortunately by the time we realized that this was the incomplete book, it was too late to return it. The book itself is great, but do not buy this edition."
1,Is this history?,"In reading this book you should keep in mind that an earlieredition devoted a whole chapter to the Shroud of Turin. Nowthat the Shroud has been proven to be a mediaval fake, you haveto ask yourself whether or not all the scholarship in this bookis just as bogus."
1,Nonsense.,"This book is full of outright lies and nonsense. As an archaeologist, the misinterpretations seemed obvious. It is very poor science when the author sets out to prove his hypotheses by manipulating sketchy evidence. It would require a low level of gullibility for an individual to accept any information in this book as truth. In this attempt to prove the improbable, the author fails."
2,The Bible as History,This edition of The Bible as History has no illustrations and the presentation is not at all like the original edition.
3,A disappointment,"This ""new"" edition (publication date of March 26, 2012) is a sore disappointment. I have the 2nd revised edition published in February 1982. From the blurb about this book, I thought I would get information on the archaeological digs and scholarly discoveries in the last 30 years. If there are any here, I sure can't find them.Although this edition is more readable because of the larger format and larger font, it is lacking a whole lot. The illustrations are gone, there is no index, the table of contents doesn't even bother to give page numbers. In addition, 10 New Testament chapters in the 2nd revised edition have been totally omitted.If you already have the 2nd revised edition, this ""new"" edition is a total waste of money. I wish I had kept my money in my checking account. On the other hand, if you haven't read that one, this one may seem great to you."
3,Hard Cover with No Illustrations,This is a very interesting book for a serious reading. Illustrations really help with comprehension. I refer to the ones in the paper back. Surprisingly the hard cover does not have a single one.
2,Missing Parts,"Product arrived on time but was missing some key components. 1) The instructions did not exactly match the product I purchased. 2) The machine screws for the mounting bracket were not in the package so I had to improvise. 3) And most importantly, the screw on collar that holds the glass to the light fixture so it does not fall off and break all over the floor was NOT in the package.I called the manufacturer, Thomas Lighting, and they were not the least bit helpful and suggested I contact whoever I bought it from since it sounded like a manufacturing problem. When did the distributor become responsible for manufacturing problems? Clearly a Thomas Lighting company product should be supported by Thomas Lighting. I am VERY UN-impressed by the quality and service, especially given the price."
5,I never believed Catholics could be so cool!,"This is an adventure romance which, if you're not careful, will make a believing Roman Catholic out of you. I'm taken aback. I'm impressed."
5,Cult classic novel,"I read this book so fast the first time that I had to read it again a week or so later. The action and plot moves so fast that I couldn't put it down. When I went back to read it the second time,this time for the language, I discovered a book full of rich prose and deep meaning. The characters are fabulous. I want to hear more about them, maybe in the sequel. I shared the book with five friends who also loved it,and now I am telling you about it on line. Read it! I can't wait for the movie..Mel Gibson would be perfect."
3,DR.T,"I saw Maggie perform live ,excellent talent,soulful and incredible jazz performance.Her album grows and becomes one with your senses."
3,I use this product for Massage Oil. It helps with Arthritus,I use this for a massage oil. It helps with Arthritus.My problem with this item is I have not received the order yet.I ordered it the same time as the Caster Oil bottle?I think it is a seperate SUPPLIER but they need to get with iton delivering more quickly.Nancy Christensen
3,Both Wheat and Chaff....,"It's probably not good for the anthology that the piece I most enjoyed was Amy Tan's introduction; I thought that by itself was worth checking the book out. The actual stories left me wanting something more, with the exception of ""The Sun, The Moon, The Stars"" by Junot Diaz, ""Real Estate"" by Lorrie Moore, ""The 5:22"" by George Harrar, and an honorable mention to Heidi Julavits' ""Marry the One Who Gets There First"". These stories all combined great writing with great insight, all in the framework of good narrative flow. The others--and I confess to not reading several--lacked something. Annie Proulx's piece sucked me in, and had vivid, sparkling dialogue and great writing. However, it failed to deliver on story. When I came to the end, enchanted by all the previous elements, I felt cheated and angry at it's sloppy conclusion. Even Stephen Dobyns' ""Kansas"" left me flat, and Dobyns never fails to impress me. Overall, this is a good collection, just not a great one by any means."
1,Slow moving. Not the best stories of the year.,"As a novel reader, I always look forward to this series because these are the some of the only short stories I invest in all year. This collection was a disappointment. As some reviewers have noted, there is a mixture of mediocre writers with brilliant ones, an up and down ride at best. There are few surprises or stretches of imagination, esp. from the B writers who tend to sound like grad students with contrived, workshopped pieces. Also, I am very tired of first person narratives, another tendancy of beginning writers. Maybe next year we'll see clear, distinct voices and risky writing throughout, not just from the handful of expert storytellers featured here."
1,No Exit,"I suppose if you like the tone and style found typically in BEST SHORT STORIES of XXXX you'll like this. For me, I find them--and especially this one--boring. After having read it, I was left with absolutely nothing: no profound revelation, no mental challenge, no rivalry at any sort of level. A sort of hell with no exit, with each turn of the page, each turn to a new story, a sort of rolling of the rock uphill. I finally had to put it down in the middle of THE BEST GIRLFRIEND.... In these stories, people live, people search, people quest...for fulfillment of common desires or exit out of circumstances that are simply silly. And in the end, nothing new is learned, no revelation discovered, not even a glimpse of some shadow of a holy grail. Just time precious time wasted that can never be recovered. Better to spend that time sitting in the corner, watching the spiders hunt. These books enlighten you nil."
2,Did I miss something?,"I am a big fan of the Best American Short Stories series, but this one was a huge diappointment. I like stories that have some meat; they should resonate with depth a long time after being read. This collection offers few such stories. Then again, I wasn't expecting much more from Amy Tan. Try '98 or '00 instead."
2,Best Short stories of 1999,"I enjoyed Amy's explaination of why she picked the stories she did much more than the stories themselves. I found myself saying,""Huh?"" after too many of them. Sorry Amy, but you missed the mark for me."
1,Not exactly bone-shaking,"Either the editors of these collections are getting lazy, or there are some politics involved that I don't understand. To include a ""B"" writer such as Pam Houston with greats like Rick Bass is an abomination. Other than the Bass story and a few others, this collection is dull and uninspired."
4,"Not Bad, but Not the Greatest Either","This year's collection of ""America's Best Short Stories"" was a surprising mix. ""The Piano Tuner"" was remarkable, in my opinion, and almost all of the other stories were fairly decent selections as well. Amy Tan, I would agree, did not pick the best set of stories I've seen in this series to date, and her intro was rather asinine and mundane, almost cliched at times. However, there are some gems here, and I would say that while one reviewer cringed at the inclusion of a so called ""B-writer,"" Pam Houston, in this case, it is this kind of writing that, for me at least, makes the series so compelling and exciting. Discovering new authors, and watching an up and coming author evolve in style from year to year is the most rewarding facet of this series."
4,Nice girl but,"I did gigs with her back in the day. Her manager made her quit her teaching job, so he could own her. He said he would make her strip and shake it to pay him back. This was after he grabbed a bag of cocaine from a ceiling tile in the rehearsal room."
1,"Personally, not the greatest book on Java","I have a background in C/C++ and even with that, I still found this book awkward. The sample code is broken, meaning they place a few lines of code, discuss some more code, place the code they described, and repeat this several times for the whole book. I found that in 'Teach Yourself C in 21 Days', the code was discussed after the program code was placed (in one piece), which I found very helpful. On the back cover on this Java book, it claims that I can, and I quote, 'Become fluent in the hottest new Internet programming language' I'm still no better off than before I read this book. This is the reason I gave this book only one star."
5,Manakas - Bravo!,"This album is an exciting, solidly played piece. Well recorded, with great ideas. Awesome is a much overused term these days but it applies to this album. Van's got chops married to genuine emotions. I can't believe this album is only available used. Great tone and delivery. The band plays well together, supportive, without being crowded. Did I say chops, I've never heard so many before, and without being pretentious, just breath-taking and moving. Van can swing too. When I email him, I'm going to ask a lot of questions about what year his Fender Telecaster is and what amp he's using to get that great tone. And who are his chicken-picking influences. Van, I love this album!Dean Zias"
5,Dropped! A Condition-Not a Character Flaw,"Great!It is a dynamic, inspirational to book to read, especially, if you are trying to grasp the concept of your purpose for living in this kaotic world. Where people go around dropping others without a reason."
1,Buyer Beware.,I ordered the nice 17.99 VCI version of Chandu and when it arrived I found that Amazon had sent me part 2 of the cheap Alpha version which costs around $5.50. I don't understand how Amazon messed my order up but they did.
1,Bad Print J.Lovins!,The print on the VCI edition is just as bad on other cheaper or 2 part editions - awful.I don't know who this Lovin's guy from MO is but he sounds like somebody from VCI and I'm surprised amazon let him post such biased reviews over and over again. The sound and picture on some chapters is as bad as it gets on DVD..not the way most people like 'em Mr.Jim.
2,"The white gold was very, very thin.","For almost $200, I expected the gold to be a little thicker. These were a gift to my mother, and I fear the gold will bend with use. We'll see...."
3,Ok,"This is the type of movie you watch when there is nothing else on or you just want to see something different. This movie is pretty entertaining if you are in this type of situation. Of course you can't expect good special effects (or acting, especially when it comes to the evil wizard) but if you are a fan of this genre you may go away satisfied. The other review gets the story down so there is no need to repeat it. The nudity is held to a minimum so if that is your thing there are plenty of other titles offered by amazon for you. But if you are looking for a sowrd and sorcery film with a little bit of t&a don't hesitate to pick this up. For the $10 it may be worth a shot, if it goes down to $5.99 it's a must have!"
1,Ho Hum,"Definately not worth buying this c.d. Its hard to believe with so many out of work singers out there that all that can muster up for this album is a bunch of slappers who can't hold a note to save themselves and most of the artists, if you can call them that, sound like they're drunk singing karaoke in a bar somewhere. What a worry!"
4,More fine Jeri work - plus Marty Paich!,"A reissue of two LPs, the first featuring Jeri with a fine Marty Paich band, with a refreshing choice of repertoire. The orchestra on the second is a bit on the slushy side, but also has excellent songs. Highlights are 'Isn't it a lovely day' and 'Spring will be a little late this year'."
5,The Clash weren't the only band that really mattered!,"X were an amazing, amazing band and this DVD really drives this point home. The live club performances show their incredible musicianship--DJ Bonebrake and Billy Zoom are PHENOMENAL! The studio performances show what incredible songwriters and artists John and Exene were. The video montages throughout put it all into context, and made me feel really nostaglic, there's nothing quite like superimposing a cruise missile over Ronnie Reagan's face to bring a tear to your eye. There's also this groovy, artsy video of Exene to White Girl that really sticks with you. No band in the last 20 years comes close to X--X were the real thing, and luckily there's The Unheard Music to remember them by. Buy it, watch it, and lend it to your paperboy, and afterwards the two of you can burn all his Emo CDs and start a band together."
5,"THE BEST, that's right, THE BEST","This is the best documentary I have ever seen on a Punk/Rock N Roll band.At present, I have the ""Los Angeles"", ""Wild Gift"", and ""Under The Big Black Sun"" albums and this DVD pretty much covers songs from those albums.The art direction in this is superb. Everything from the stock footage, to live footage to interviews to photo's, looks amazing.I'd give this 6 stars if I could.If any X fans like me, haven't seen this but own those albums, GET THIS NOW. Trust me."
5,Punk Spunk!,"... No, really, this is a WONDERFUL documentary, of interest to people other than punk fans. Brilliantly edited, it tells the story of not only X's beginnings, but is a wonderful commentary on the state of the music industry, as timely now as it was in the early 1980's.But if you're looking for a ""then we auditioned for a record label"" kind of documentary, forget it. Their story is interspersed with sometimes hilariously insightful vintage film clips, and terriffic live footage.This happens to be one of my favorite movies about one of my favorite bands, a band that made some of the best music, with some of the most creative, ""meaningful"" lyrics, ever written.No John, Exene, Billy, & D.J., your music was and is not ""unheard"".Mesmerizing."
5,"If you're not an X fan, you will be...","I saw The Unheard Music on the Sundance movie channel a few months ago and immediately began searching for it. To my dismay, it's nowhere to be found. It's an injustice that this film is out of print, and I would like to issue a plea for its return to the shelves. I don't know who or what produced it, but if you're out there, PLEASE RE-RELEASE THIS FILM!!"
5,There phone's off the hook....,I saw this film many years ago and was stunned by it....it's images still role through my mind and the music is unforgettable.....re-release this film NOW!
1,american zen,"I am not sure that all the people how have read this book are mentaly stable, all I know is that I have sought metal help ever since i read this book."
2,Zen? Not so much,"American Zen by Ron Olson was recommended to me by a member of my National Guard unit - ""Did you know CPT Olson wrote a book on zen?"" So I had to have one.This book is 366 little aphorisms that aren't Buddhist, have little or nothing to do with Zen, and some of them barely rise above the level of ""post-it thoughts stuck to a monitor,"" such as #97 ""If you ever see a blank stare on my face, it's just my screen saver.""Maybe I'll have my copy signed by the author and then relist it."
4,Very Good Image Quality,I'd previously seen all these movies and played one of the DVDs after buying the set. Image quality was very good for a remastered 70 year old film. Amazon shipped super fast even with free shipping.
4,"""Essential""(ly) incomplete....","I can only assume that the apparent short shrift that Ford's arguably finest film, ""Young Mr. Lincoln"",seems to be getting from the ""Ford at Fox"" folks (it's not included in the ""Essential Ford"" box, and seems to have been only begrudgingly included in the main set)is due to a possible licensing agreement with Criterion, who put out the (excellent)double-disc release of the film last year. Since I already own the Criterion disc, I guess I just resent the implication that ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" is somehow considered ""essential"", and ""Mr. Lincoln"" is not..Oh well, a minor quibble, I suppose. I wish Fox would include Dwan's ""Frontier Marshall"" in the main ""Ford at Fox"" box (as they apparently are in the ""Essential Ford"" set)..But when all is said and done, who cares? Gear your accordions up for ""Red River Valley""! On December 4th, the Ford Fest commences!!"
5,Great Deal!,This hitch cover was exacty what I have been looking for. Heavy duty and beautiful. I had a plastic one which lasted about two months. This should last a good long time. My wife even knocked it going out of the driveway and no problems. Perfection.
1,not workable,The mudflaps I ordered for the front of my 2008 Tahoe did not fit and I returned them. Then I could not find a matching set that would work so I was not able to use them and had to go to GM to get the right ones. So I am stuck wi.th two rear mudflaps
3,Extremely Depresing,"I recently saw Brooklyn on broadway, 3rd row seats. The songs were very good and sung very well but they are extremely depressing some. My personal favorites were Once upon a time and Brooklyn in the blood. But some you just can't feel happy listning to. If you are a fan of the musical comdey then you will probably hate Brooklyn. The music is sung extremely well. I was very happy to see Eden Espinoza. Her voice is wonderful. But the songs with the father are sad. So, if you like happy musicals you may not want to buy Brooklyn. But they are worth listning to at least once because some are spectacular."
2,Once Upon A Time,"This CD seems ok, but I can't get away from Once Upon A Time. That is the only songs that I like to listen to. I dislike the fact that there is so much dialogue on this cd. I wanna hear music. And: I do not like Cleavan Derricks, Karen Olico or Ramona Keller based on their voices and acting."
1,Not much melody,I made the mistake of not listening to tracks before I purchased this album. The music lacks melody. The album would not drawm me to see this show.
2,Pretty bad,I got this as a chrismas gift from my sister.This not not what musical's should be about.There is only one song on this whole CD that I like.The singing is not very good and it can be very annoying.All in all this is just not my taste.
3,It's OKAY...,"I saw a performance by the cast on NBC's Christmas In Rockafeller Center of ""Once Upon A Time"". Thought it was a great performance by both the cast and its featured soloist, Eden Espinosa. Then, bought the CD for the show and in its entirety, I didn't think it was great, but it wasn't bad either. The show seems pretty flat and the whole story line of a girl trying to find her dad you would think is compelling, but it just comes off pretty boring. The two noteworthy performances are ""Once Upon A Time"" and ""Raven"". Other than that, I find myself saying ""Eh""."
2,Not worth it...,"I only purchased this album after hearing ""Once Upon A Time"" on a website. I figured I would buy the album for that and discover what other good songs were on the album. So far, I have listened to ""Once Upon A Time"" around 100 times and everyother song only once...once is a enough. These songs, with the exception of ""Once Upon A Time,"" failed to thrill me and I was disappointed with a lot of the melodies. I searched and searched for ""Once Upon A Time,"" as a single to download, but its no where to be found. A glorious song on an otherwise horrible album."
1,Horrible musical! Don't waste your money!,"I, foolishly, bought this musical on just reviews from online. This is a total piece of trash. There is hardly ANY plot and the songs and absolutely ridiculous. The lyrics and songs are grotesque! The lyrics are pointless and the songs lack a strong melody and don't even follow along with the ""orchestra""! When Karen Olivio would sing double forte, the orchestra wouldn't have a melodic surge to heighten the emotion!!!! This musical is so bad I feel almost GUILTY for buying it. The only reason you would is because the vocals, at least the female ones, are quite amazing. Especially Eden and Karen. Ramona...I just hate nasal voices.I beg of you, do NOT waste your money!!!"
4,Great songs but not an amazing c.d.,"This show has some great songs. Heart Behinds These Hands, Once Upon a Time, and Raven are wonderful. They have beautiful chords and are full of emotion. But there are many filler songs on this c.d., and some that I am not that fond of. You will always have favorite songs on a c.d., even if you adore the entire thing. But I give this disk Four Stars for some unremarkable songs and the need to have a remote close by."
5,Great Musical,"Even though this musical was performed basically on a sidewalk, It deserves more recognition for how amazing it really is! Loved every second of it."
3,BKLYN--Broadway Musical,"Personally, I think the music is ""screechy"" from this show and I didn't hear a lot of good things about it from people who saw it on Broadway. It had a pretty limited run. My daughter likes the music a lot, however, and so I bought it for her."
3,"Songs arent' bad, but volume drives me crazy","I was listening to it and constently turning volume up when the talk or its a soft song and then turning it way down when it get louder. The sound drives me crazy, up down up down, I can't stand that. musical isn't bad, but nothing great, some nice songs are in there though."
4,"not RENT, but give it a try","STOP SPREADING THE WORD THAT THIS IS LIKE RENT.awesome. that's it. it's not comparable to Rent because, with the exception of character types and the set, it is not at all like Rent. It's worth $25 just to hear Eden belt out ""Once Upon A Time."" However, i don't reccomend just buying that song on iTunes or something because there are deffinately other really good songs (heart behind these hands, raven, etc.) don't be afrai to buy this because it's not like Rent. in case you didn't notice a lot of other really good musicals are also not like Rent... if you are at a loss of thinking of some, let me help you- Wicked, The Light in the Piazza, Spamalot, Sound of Music, Gypsy, Pajama Game, Millie, Avenue Q. oh, PS most of thoses musicals were nominated for BEST MUSICAL at the TONYS and they arn't like Rent either."
4,"Hard-hitting, attitude-filled East Coast Swing!","Dem Brooklyn Bums are everything East Coast Swing is all about---the attitude! This 6 song CD is filled with swingin' tunes that any fan of Royal Crown Revue would love. The vocals have a punk/ska feel to them, but the music is all swing. Great release by these NY natives."
4,Not bad but not exactly incredible,I have this 2CD it is good but what is odd is that most of the songs are in fact quite old eg 1950 and 1960's music. Highlights are Es Paradis by The Fatman himself and Super Sharp Shooter by Dj hype and Cut La Roc's New York Pimp and Wax Assassins baddest dj on two turntables. A warning most of the songs are quite short.
1,bad quality,this was a poor quality reprint blurry lacks the info i was hoping for i know how to build one of these but its been 50 yrs wont be buying from this vendor anymore
3,"Great Content, Horrible Imaging on this Reprint...","I am glad that this book was reprinted. There is much valuable information inside its pages. Of course the photo showing the timing marks (while the engine is upside down) are misleading. I have sold quite a few of these books to customers. My last order with amazon was for over 20 copies. However, there is a serious quality issue when looking at the printing. It looks as if they did a digital image of each page, and then put that to copy. My two original prints I have have much, much better quality for photos and diagrams than this book. Who knows where it was printed and its CoO.5 for information and 1 for low quality printing."
1,this book is TERRIBLE!!!!!,"this book has the worst pictures to follow I have ever seen in a manual. The contrast is so dark you can not see anythig but black blobs. I can not believe this manual is even on the market.The writing is ok but very plain. do your self a favor and save your money.There are not many books on Y blocks for ford, and it is too bad that this is what a person has to choose from."
3,Nice pictures,"Well written and informative, but the reproduction of the photos is very poor......nothing against the author who is very knowledgable about the Y-block engines, the publisher needs to update the pictures."
2,"Good technical information, but.....","this entire book looks like a photocopy. The pictures are so black you can't even make some of them out, let alone see any detail. I have several other books published by MBI, and they are all first class. I can't believe they would release something of such poor quality. If it wasn't for the good history brief of where this engine design fits into the chronology of Ford V8 engine development, and the high quality technical information (I think it is the only book around on the Y-block) contained in this book, I would have given it only one star."
2,Disappointed,"I was very excited to see this book was finally reprinted. When it arrived my excitement turned to disappointment. The photos and illustrations are terrible. It looks like it was copied by a child on a cheap copy machine. At around $13 dollars, I guess that's about the best quality you can expect."
2,Cheap photocopied edition,"For $12.69 I got my monies worth, but the pictures are terrible. A couple are almost entirely BLACK. Certainly this can't be a first run printing."
2,Ford Y-Block,"Heavy in history, light on useful technical details. This book does little to fill in the details of Y-Block information. Missing are things like engine casting codes. Also missing is something usually included in these types of engine-specific books; performance tuning tips. This book is a must-have but only because nothing else is available."
5,Husband had prostate Turp procedure 3 months of incontinence. This was by far the best product and Amazon has the best prices.,This product was the best for my husband who had prostate surgery and was post op incontinent. He used them for 3 months.
5,Superior coverage and great price,"The great thing about these is that they are w-i-d-e-r than other pads, meaning that you don't have to double them up for extra protection. They really take care of business for my Dad who has moderate incontinence. Very highly recommended."
2,not absorbant enough,These pads were not as absorbent as the Walgreen's brand and costs a little more. So we will go back to Certainty Walgreens male guards.
3,"Not for me, so I can't say really.","The price for these after research seemed good. I ordered them for a relative, so I can't say anything about them. As far as I know they were OK. All I can say is that the price seemed OK. I set up a subscribe and save.p.s. Amazon - make it clear how to say something is a gift so you don't have to review it when you can't!"
1,Fraud! Beware!,"Fraud! Yes, I use the word like a bullet and am aware of its potency. Fraud. This is not Stabbing Westward. While the songs are certainly replications of the intellectual property belonging to Stabbing Westward, these are distasteful and offensive to any fan (or any human being with ears and a credit card, for that matter). If you enjoy low-grade MIDI karaoke recordings... well then you probably aren't a Stabbing Westward fan (low-fi is artistic when done intentionally... this wasn't intentional). So that leaves only one classification of people to whom I speak: the people who will be more offended by the sound of this conterfeit garbage than by the sound of three dollars clogging their toilet. Buyer beware; Stabbing Westward fans... be smart and don't fall for this alluring yet unimaginably disappointing trap."
1,"It's the singer, but not the band","I bought ""Save Yourself"" on iTunes to give it a listen and check it out. It was the most horrible version of the song I have ever heard.After some research, I found out that it is indeed Christopher on vocals, but the ones performing the music has no ties with the band, Stabbing Westward. I even contacted Cleopatra Records, who informed me that it is Chris but not the remaining members.I'm sorry I purchased just the one song. The worst song purchase I have ever made.Cleopatra Records has a history of releasing stuff like this. They just recently released a ""Trapt"" album titled ""Headstrong."" Again, the vocalist, but doesn't sound like the band."
5,Maglite 2D,"I ordered a two Maglite 3C, but either by mistake or intentional, Amazon substituted 2 Maglite 2D flashlites. Although I don't care for the increased diameter and weight, in the end it didn't much matter because the flashlites are carried in the door pockets of my truck. Also considered was the 2 Maglite AA2 flashlites bundled with the 2D's. Quite a bit of value there for my money. Oh, of course, the flashlites are superb."
4,The Third battery really does improve brightness,I needed a rugged flashlight for walking the dogs at night that I could put in my hoodie pocket... this one has impressive brightness for it's size I should buy a couple more for the truck...as for 4 stars this product is no frills but performs as expected
4,Good sized flashlight.,Not as big and bulky as the D-cell but provides similar light. Not a LED light though.
4,"""Sing"" has me dancin'","Talk about a classic that was completely underrated when it was released! The music has energy and is a great flashback to the late 80's/early 1990. The songs,""Birthday Suit"" and ""You Don't Have to Ask Me Twice"" are reminiscent of so many of the songs that I enjoyed while dancing the night away. ""What's the Matter With Love"" and ""One More Time"" are my favorites. And if anyone is in search of a song for a graduation ceremony, you couldn't find anything better than ""We'll Never Say Goodbye"" (that is, if you are still caught up in the 80's).I have to admit, the energy of this album makes this perfect when it comes to picking up the pace while walking. So, if you are looking for a memory rush and need something to make that exercise go a little faster, buy ""Sing""."
1,"Alternate way to find ""Romance"" for less money","For years, I've been looking for this soundtrack--to have only ONE song--since the rest of the album is horrid (come on...who really likes Michael Bolton???). I refuse to pay 99 bucks for one song! ""Romance"", the love theme from ""Sing"" is actually sung by Paul Carrack and Terri Nunn (from Berlin) and is the only decent song on the album. No download sites have any listing for the song--I've checked all of the majors--iTunes, RealPlayer, etc... Some quick searches on the internet led me to find a compilation cd entitled ""Hot Duets"" which has ""Romance"". This album is available at Amazon for under $10."
5,An enchanting read!,"This is the kind of book you want to read out loud by the fireplace with your children beside you. It's has great family values and entertainment. A gentle, enchanting story of a young girl rediscovering her heritage through the magic of a butterfly."
3,"Beautiful music but,,,,,","This is not what I had hoped it would be. Unfortunately, the original recordings are not on this CD and the singers while lovely to listen to are NOT quite the quality that I am used to. If you order this CD be aware that it will not sound like the ones we listened to in the 1980's. I was so disappointed about that, however the words are always a blessing."
1,Not very good,"I purchased these Allen T-handle hex wrenches figuring they should last quite a while, but I was wrong. The first time I used 2 of these T-handles, I rounded both tips. My old set (which are from a different manufacturer)that are 10 years old. The application for which I use them, has not changed in all these years."
4,"Recommended for single-purpose job, but great overall","Like many, I was recommended to grab this set for a specific purpose, swapping out the processors on a Mac Pro. The tool did its job well, but now I have a complete set of extra-long screwdrivers too. The allen wench handle, and super long length, enables these screwdrivers to go where others don't.Only drawback is the cheap build quality, the red rubber handle was just thrown on there... or at least, feels like someone in China just threw it on there at rapid fire."
2,"Wrenches are great, packageing bites","i got this set of allen wrenches, they arrived on time and actually a day early. only problem was 2 things. #1 the packageing, it was all cracked and ripped up like it had been in the sun for days, in fact the wrenches had spots of rust proveing that the person selling this through amazon needs to get an indoor warehouse (almost looked used when listed as new!!!). #2 the company says american tools or something to that effect but they are made in china which is disapointing. AMAZON GET AMERICAN MADE after all you take American Dollars$$$if not for the fact that they came in used condition and listed as new and that the nice packageing (which was a clear vinal that could hold them all and had a snap close feature) was all cracked i would of given at least a 4, no 5's unless its american made or says its not clearly on description of product."
3,Looks good but some problems,"This pepper mill looks spectacular, a classic shape and terrific color. However, the top knob loosens with every grind. You have to tighten the knob each time you use the mill or else it will fall off. That's inconvenient."
1,Underwhelming,"A friend recommended this CD to me after he had seen them live a couple months ago. The drums are great, but the vocals are a bit annoying. Also, it seems they are trying to do a little too much all at once - they need some focus. I think with the right vocalist, they might gain a wider audience. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head with the guitar tones sounding too 'overprocessed'. Sometimes less is more, and this album is far too much. The drummer is outstanding, but I would not recommend this CD to anyone I know."
2,"Good selections, bad mixing.","This CD has some pretty good jams in it. It's cheap, too. But, the mixing is the worst I've heard ever on a CD. What were they thinking releasing this without polishing it up first?"
5,very happy,"I take multiple digital pictures for various purposes regarding the field of architecture and planning. This camera is a great buy, and I am very happy with the quality of the pictures it produces. With a true 4MP image, It produces large enough pictures for my presentations.When I was searching I wanted a brand that I was familiar with, because I ran into some manufacturers claiming they were selling 5-12 MP cameras for dirt cheap. However, most of these MP calculations were interpoliated, which actually ruins the picture. I am very satisfied with this product!"
4,"Good, but slow to reset","I bought two of these cameras and printer docks because it was so easy to learn -- this was my first digital camera. It takes nice pictures without red-eye. The only issue with it is that it takes so long to reset between pictures that the subjects start to walk away after the first shot. Because of that, I am switching to a new camera soon. The Kodak software is good for uploading images to the Kodak website for sharing pictures easily and ordering photos. But, the software tends to be very buggy and takes forever to install and update. The Kodak printer dock makes very nice prints -- when it works. I had to send one of the docks back for repair within the first year. Frequently, the docks are not recognized by my computers."
4,Nice Book,"Good book, but seems to be more related to mechanical/aeronautical engineers, rather than structural engineers. I am working on a masters in structural engineering and this book was required for my stability/vibrations of structures class. The professor thinks timoshinkens book would be a better fit for us."
5,Jimmy Swaggart him self sent me this book,"Afte Mr. Swaggart had his problems, he sent me this book. It talks about faith. About LITTLE people doing BIG things. I recomend this book as one of the best ones I have ever read. Mynor Vargas"
3,Yuck,"Mindscape (they made this, Ubi Soft made Petz 5) made some real mistakes.Bugs, bugs, bugs. This game is full of them. The food dish bounces around and your catz never get a chance to eat. Toys permanently disappear from the playscenes. For example, the cannon ball disappears from the Circus Playscene. The game may crash every so often and you lose everything you did.Where did BUNNIES come from? Hello? This is Catz 4; bunnies aren't cats. It probably wouldn't be so bad if you could breed them, but you can't. Big bummer. As for talking to your catz, I couldn't get them to understand me properly, so I just forgot about it.The game is almost like a bug-filled dull Catz 3. Why bother expanding, then? They are almost the same, except for new clothes that barely even have complete outfits, new scenes that lose their unique toys in a day, and bunnies that can't even breed. The only reason I gave it three stars and not one or two is because it does at least have new features."
4,Pretty Cool,This game is pretty cool. I got it and the voice recognition didnt work. But it is still fun. When your cat is preagnet it takes about 3-4 days for it to have a kitten. You can also get realy cute bunniez!I would have given this game a 5 star if the voice recognition worked and the bunniez could be parents.[If your not very patient this game is not realy for you]
5,Catz 4 rules!,"This game is really cool! You can choose from 10 breeds of catz, such as a maine coon or persian, and 1 bunny. You take them home to a lot of different playscenes, like arabia. Catz grow up, fall in love, and have kittenz! There are over 100 toyz. I recomend this game for kids age 9 and up."
2,if you'd like a hot water sprinkler...,"this crock pot has 3 settings: warm, scalding and blast furnace. warm cooks nothing, scalding evaporates liquids and drys food in less than 2 hrs, and blast furnace should be used in place of kiln. The worst feature / drawback of this not-so-fine unit is the hot water spitting that occurs after 2 or so hours that leaves your countertops wet and messy. I returned this and bought a Rival. Far better - no comparison."
5,Excelent!!!,I purchased AMARIGE MARIAGE by Givenchy for WOMEN: EAU DE PARFUM .13 OZ for my daughter and she is very happy!
4,Counting Coup: Defining All Odds.,"The book Counting Coup is about a reporter Larry Colton that comes to a small town in Montana to write a book about the boys basketball team. When he gets to Hardin High School He saw a girl playing basketball Sharon Laforge and knew right away that's his story was in the girl's team.This book is for any age, race, or gender. If you appreciate basketball and people getting their problems this will be a fast read for you."
4,A different slice of life,"Reminiscent of ""Season on the Brink"", this book presents a world that I'm not familiar with but, in a way, am completely familiar with. The most interesting thing is how bias and prejudice and the debilitating aspects of ""the dole"" are universal. In my world, it's black and white. Here, it's red and white.Hats off to a guy who has the courage to leave out the political correctness and just ""tell it like it is"". There are no simple good guys and bad guys here. There's just folks living there lives dealing with some really big problems. One nagging question since I read this a few months back: Why did the author sit on this book for several years without finishing/publishing?"
4,I enjoyed reading this book,"I really enjoyed reading this book. This book tells us not only the basketball story or Sharon herself, but the real inside Rez life and how much author cared about Sharon. It was pretty interesting for me learning about Native-American's life especially Sharon's life."
3,Counting Coup,i found counting coup as a very well written and decriptive book. Larry Colton is not some great novelist but he writes a very good book. His book is a very true to life story that is pretty much just a great story of his time well spent on an indian reservation. He makes very good assumptions after spending time on the res. After reading this book it will make you become very interested in not only the love that is behind a game but also the time and effort it takes to do something that yo love very well and stick with it.
3,Counting Coup Review,"Counting Coup is a book primarily about life on and off the basketball court, while also acknowledging the Indian culture and observing how they deal with every day life. Larry Colton wrote this book very vividly, so the story line is running through your mind like a movie.Sharon LaForge, the main character, manages to break cycles and overcome the alcoholism which runs through her family. Her gift is basketball which has somewhat taught her lessons of life."
4,Culture meets modern day life,"This book was assigned to me in my Reading Improvement class and my first thought was boring! I began reading it then it became so interesting I couldn't put it down. It relates mainly to Indian culture as well as basketball. During my reading I found myself wanting to scream; I felt I should have been at the game with a foam finger. The neat thing about this book was that it was based on a true story. During the middle of the book, it was nice to see the pictures of the people you were reading about. It was also nice to learn about some of the things that the Crow tribe did as traditions. I recommend this book highly and I think it would definitely be enjoyable. If you have ever been a part of a group whether it be a dance group or a track team, I suggest you look into this book. It will definitely keep your interests."
4,Counting Coup,"Before reading Counting Coup, I thought it would be just another boring girls basketball story. This book proved to me that there is more to womens basketball then what you watch during a game. This shows just how important working together is if you want to accomplish something great. Towards the beginning of their season, the team was winning with ease as they worked as one. Unfortunately for Coach Mac and her team, they started to play their own individual game and not what Coach Mac taught them to play. Many of the characters in this book, encounter many problems as the try to reach their goal which is the State Championship. I recommend this book for those who are in a sport and need the inspiration to excel."
3,My review of this book,This book is a good book in the fact that it shows the struggles of a young teenager growing up in a difficult environment. She goes through some tough times as she struggles to coupe with the environment she has grown up around. The aurhtor has written this book to make you feel as if you were seeing things as Sharon see's them. The aurthor has done well with going into detail about the story and how involved each character gets and why. It seems to leave you in suspense throughout the story to see if Sharon will do as the others do or come out on top and show everyone that she can succeed. All in all this book has some very good points with it to show how people can go through different hardships and still come out on top because of their outlook on life; regardless of their upbringing.
1,"Look up ""hubris"" in the dictionary",And you'll find a picture of Larry Colton. I'd think 15 months would be long enough to find out Montantans can READ. At the very least he could have changed the names of minors before discussing their intimate lives.
3,Educational,"Counting Coup helped me understand the Native American way of life. From a cultural standpoint, it was very educational. I was, however, saddened by the book and it's reference to the hopelessness many of the Indians feel in pursuing college and a career after high school."
5,Excelent,"Having to read this book for summer reading assignment for school, I was skeptical at first. But I soon found that I had nothing to worry. This is an excellent book that takes a look basket but also life on the reservation. I would recommend this book to a basketball fan and even people who are not."
4,Counting coup reveiw,"Counting coup a book of life. This was a book that I feel should be recommeded to all high school students. Just for the simple fact that it was about low class society, and hope to make it out. When I mean making it out. I mean getting a better life than what they a living. Also when I read the book it gave me a sense of hope and i'm already in college. So basically I feel if a person is just about to give on life. I would tell that person to they need to read counting coup. Next the author does a great on following the teenager. also I really respect him for putting so much time into his work"
1,Homophobic Trash without Question!!!,"For anyone who thinks Welsing has a brain in her head, please read Essex Hemphill's ""If Freud were a Crazy Colored Woman"" in his collection ""Ceremonies."" Welsing positions herself as a saviour to the black community, yet she will trash black gay men as if it were nothing. If a person of any race or gender said about black women what Welsing says about black gay men, you couldn't nail her down to her seat. This is the most oppressive text I have ever read. It is full of passe Freudianism and obsessive thinking about the phallus. I am a worse-off person for ever learning that this book exists. Only the Devil could have written this book!"
1,Jeeeze!,"The absurdity of this book will leave ANY intelligent, educated person completely speechless....regardless of their race. This book could only be targeted at truly ignorant, ill-informed people. Afrocentric beliefs are one thing....but this stuff is TRULY insulting to anyone with a drop of scientific understanding....or basic common sense. It's shameful."
5,Balance is needed!!!,"I love this book. For all the degrading things that were written about blacks by whites this is a necessary balance. There is nothing weird about this work, I find many of the christian stories very weird. I applaud Dr. Welsing for having the courage to write this book. It provides insight to what is really going on in the world today. More of this this material is needed. Majority of whites hates us and thats never going to change. I always wondered why they hate us when we never did anything to them, this book cleared it up for me. We will never give up, we will win because we are true warriors. The Isis Papers should be read by every black man and woman on the planet."
1,the Mein Kampf of afrocentrism,"This is the definitive manifesto of afro-nazism. Buried under all the blather about the glories of melanin is the simple message thet ALL whites are irredeemably racist, even those who sincerely believe themselves not to be."
1,A poor review,I personally don't recommend this book. It will uncoil your mind more than it will pull African consciousness concepts together. Reading this books makes you actually wonder where she got her PhD from.It is impossible to find merit in loosly tied concepts. Everything related to the Black mans penis is farfetched and reaching.She does make some good points about family that I've incorporated into my philosophy but beyond that I would suggest a host of other books before reading this one.
1,Entertainment Value is High,"I read this book years ago and picked it up again after a friend discovered it. I figured I'd give the book another chance, perhaps my older self will find something I hadn't appreciated before.NOT!This book reads like sci-fi to me. The author reaches ""conclusions"" that are in, fact, obvious to anyone living in America: there is racism and darker-skinned people suffer it most. Oh, really?If you want to read a homophobic, woman-bashing, sci-fi pontification on race relations, and would like to be entertained, by all means buy this book. Otherwise, rent a movie and curl up with some popcorn and your favorite blanket...you'll be much more satisfied."
1,The black man's Mein Kampf,"This book is just an example of anit-""white"" hatred. Frances Cress Welsing just used her book as an outlet for white bashing and crying about the ""bad lot"" her people have given to themselves. This is another pathetic attempt to make white people(white men mostly)feel bad about themselves. Welsing is just another incompetent racist/bigot who couldn't find her way out of a paper bag and what makes the whole thing worse is that because Welsing is black most people won't call her a racist or a bigot, they will call her a ""hero""."
3,"extreme, but does make u wonder","I will first of all state that this book can be dangerous to easily influenced minds and can fill them with false ideals and theories. I however gave it 3 stars because of some facts in it that are true whether society believes it or not. If the book is read with an objective mind, one can hopefully pick out some useful facts and put it away knowing that a lot of its extreme claims are unfounded.Now I am interested in reading mein Kupf(sp?) and compare it to this book in regards to the authors' goals..."
1,ahem,"Amazon.com seems to have mangled the review I posted yesterday, cutting it off in mid-sentence and adding a period. No matter; it is the same as the one I posted February 27, 1999, for the paperback edition and can be read there. I only tried posting it here because I did not think the sycophantic drivel below ought to go unchallenged. Oh well, at least this way I get to drag that grotesque screed's average rating even lower -that is, if Amazon.com doesn't screw it up for me again."
1,Racism Defined,"This is one of the most patently absurd books one could ever hope to read. The assertions put forth in it are bizarre in the extreme (for a real chuckle, read the part about the symbolism of balls and ask yourself what, then, must be the symbolism of yellow tennis balls?). People who are racist towards whites and willing to abandon all reason to justify that racism will love this book. Everyone else will find it funny, abhorrent, or both."
1,scary to think that people actually take this seriously,"if society doesn't start standing up to people like this author, then we are destined to repeat the horrors of earlier this century all over again. Haven't we as a world been through enough? c'mon now, any sensible person knows that this is the work of a frustrated, angry woman with thwarted views. I'm reminded of the saying, (or something close to it) alot of knowledge and education can help you go far, but a little education and ALOT OF IMAGINATION can make a person go NUTS!!"
1,Simplistic,A sad indictment of pseudo-scholarship. Her sweeping generalisations could be applied to *any* population group. Surprised Welsing doesn't go into depth re: her usual fetish i.e. the size of penises and her homophobic rantings. Maybe next time.......
4,Profound Work,For all of you who regard men as intellectually superior to women... read this book and think again. Miss Welsing is uncompromising in her delivery. She has a unique and deliberate perspective of the underlying psychology of Western Civilization (designed by white men). This book is sure to open your understanding on the issues of race/power in America.
1,Misdirected hate posing as scientific thought,"Dr. Welsing's obvious pseudoscientific discourse based on her misguided racist perception does more harm to the psyche of those she claims to want to help, than it does good. I would reccommend other authors with more integrity from the African Diaspora such as Henry Louis Gates Jr.. Kwame Anthony Appiah, Cornel West, Derrick Bell, among others. Welsing is on the par with Leonard Jffries in her biased pseudoscientific racism that doesn not benefit anyone except those that wish to cultivate perpetual anger and vicious circles of hate in their hearts instead of exploring avenues to solve the current heinous realityof mutual hatred and distrust that has infected many groups in this country."
4,This book is thought provoking and a definate eye opener.,"I enjoyed the knowlegeable perspective on the subject of race and race relations. The views of Mrs. Welsing are in definate contrast to what many people both white and non-white view the current conditions of the world. The positive points of the book lie in the philosophy that White peoples react to non-white on a very sub-consience level intrigues me and I agree, the key to race relations lie in the true heart of the problem and not the after effects of the current condition of the peoples both white and non-white. On a negative note there are times when Dr. Welsings facts overflow into the very grey area of opinion. I enjoy her opinion but hard facts are never disputable.Shawna Kent"
1,Hating Whitey...,"If you think this book is outlandish and poorly written then check out ""Hating Whitey: and other progressive causes"" by David Horowitz, author of Radical Son. Politics and politicians whether black white or somewhere in between have made use of any all of the arguments, statistics (all or some) to get what THEY want, not the people. I also wish that when people decide to write a review they edit mistakes, use grammar and punctuation and when using words they use them correctly. I.E. People make an IMPACT, nothing impacts...By the by, women as a group have been put down far longer than any color group on this planet. Put that in your pipe and smoke it!"
5,Abadon hope all ye who enter,"Dante's Inferno depicts the title of my review as being the words found on the doors at the entrance to Hell. The phrase is appropo here because if one reads this book looking for a good time, a mere intellectual execercise or with their Christianity on their sleeve, one will become discombobulated. Much of the work is intensely searing in its critique of whites/Christians and how they have misused Christianity to propagate and maintain white superiority. Read if, and only if, you are ready for an unadulterated approach to understanding racism, its devastating results and its ultimate goal."
5,"""Let Those Who Have Eyes""","This is timeless- for all of us struggling to truly make sense of Racism by people who spend their lives copying and stealing the accomplishments of those they hate.Racism is simply 'envy with nowhere to go'. Today's envy is manifested in lip injections to 'plump up'thin slits, butte implants say that those big butts that were so gross on black women are now OK!! And THE OBSESSION TO ADOPT BLACK CHILDREN AND MARRY BLACK MEN!!!Read the Book."
4,Great sampling of asian american women's writing,I read this book in college and thought it was a great sample of asian american women's writing. Some of the short stories really stand out and what especially nice is that the book contains stories from veteran writers as well as new comers.
3,"Interesting, but not compelling","Got this book in advance of visiting area. While it had some good sections, it was very specific to dam/activities surrounding it. Good, but not great, book"
2,Not that great,"The quality of the artwork was good, however it leaves an ugly yellow patch where white space should be. This isn't worth the money"
4,"Easy to use, great results","I've used this product for about 10 t-shirts, and was impressed with the results! Easy to use, good quality (I didn't experience the yellow effect others mentioned), and REALLY useful for making small lots of personalized t-shirts on short notice. Great personalized gift maker, too. I've only printed B&W, so can't comment on results with colour printing."
1,DON'T BUY THIS! It will ruin your project!,"This product leaves an ugly yellow stain where the design is ""white."" You can't wash the yellow out. You can't iron it out. Buy the product made by Hanes."
4,It works great...fast and easy to clean up ..,Great machine ...works with little clean up ..and easy storage
1,Does NOT fit my 2003 Ranger 4WD,"This rotor is 3/4"" smaller in diameter than the original rotor on my truck. I did not check any of the other dimensions since the diameter is critical. My Ranger XLT 4WD 4.0 came with 12"" rotors. These are 11-1/4"" rotors."
2,Had to Return,I brought this corvette for my 4 year old daughter and I had to return it. Being a previous owner of a power wheel this was extremely slow. I think the radio needed to be in there so they wouldn't get bored.
1,PIECE OF JUNK - DO NOT BUY,This corvette is a piece of junk! Even in high speed the car does not go the 5mph and oh if you are think of getting an extra battery to have on hand - you cannot purchase them in one of your local stores. You have to call Safety 1st and order through them where I was just told by the customer service rep that the battery itself is $50 and the shipping is $13.91. What a piece of junk - save yourself the $300. My goodness for a mom that doesn't have a lot of $ but wanted to give her daughter one nice thing this is very disappointing!!!! Safety 1st customer service is not very helpful either!!!!
1,RUINED MY KIDS XMAS!!!,Boy was she excited to see this under the tree. Ok we put it together only one side would go so she ended up going in circles. Her big sisters were nice enough to push her around all day. It was also leaking a liquid :-( we have had quite a few electric cars and they never had any problems. We call the company and they tell us it needs a new motor and to bring it into a service station??!! HI We JUST BOUGHT THIS! IT'S NEW there should not be any problems. Promptly returned it to the store. What a horribel product and horrible company.
2,Piece of junk,"We purchased this vehicle for our daughter for her 5th birthday and have been disappointed from day one. The car's electronics don't work at all and the steering wheel doesn't work either. We took it back to Toys r us because they assembled it and were told too bad, call the 1-800 number because we don't service these. We never even used it, we were given a defective product and our daughter is sad because she's seen it but never riden in it. Happy Birthday, huh?We are going to return it because of the sorry excuse for customer service seen at Toy r us...way to stand behind your assembly and product!! I'm appalled and won't shop there again.Don't waste your money buying this unless you have a degree in engineering and electronics."
1,"danger, danger",This toy is extremly dagerious for childern to ride if there is even a slight encline. Also in the Toys R Us store in Johnson City Tennessee While the car was being charged it caught on Fire. It has a weight amount of 120 lbs. when my grandaughter and niece together weighing about 90 lbs rode in the driveway it started going backwards very fast and uncontrolable it ran into a large stump that could have killed them if it had hit in the right way. It totally has no stopping system.
2,"Mediocre, at best","We borrowed this title from the library and would not recommend it. Surely there's something better out there!A few observations: no native Spanish speakers, poor pronunciation (e.g. ""comida"" sounds a lot like gomeda or gometa), and really awful music that gets stuck in your head (but not in a good way that reinforces any learning). As a teacher, I know that music is a powerful way to reinforce learning -- the music here is a missed opportunity.There is so much potential for this kind of series, but this one seriously falls short. I am giving it two stars instead of one for the simple reason that my 2 and 3 year olds willingly sat through it, which has piqued their interest in the Spanish language. There's value in that."
5,A real pleasure to listen,"I have always been fan of Andreas' music. The very first piece I heard was in South America and it was from the album ""Down to the moon"". I started buying almost all of his albums and ""Dancing with the Lion"" is one of his best."
2,Nothing new,"If you're a Vollenweider fan, I guess you'll get more out of `Dancing with the Lion' than I did. Some of the tracks are all right, but some are almost cliched new age pieces (one track, `Still Life,' has these atrocious Kenny G.-like saxophone solos). To me, this is just a rather unoriginal follow-up to `Down to the Moon' - althogether a stronger album and a much more tolerable new age release."
4,Luceno does it again,"Bottom line: This book was very good. I enjoyed it from the first word to the very last word. If you have read any of Luceno's other works and you enjoyed them, think about picking up a copy of ""Cloak of Deception."" The story does an excellent job of explaining all the details that caused the actions of people in Episode 1. I highly recommend this enthralling book."
3,"Good big-picture background, but lacks strong characters","Reason for writing this review, too many reviews give 4-5 stars. To clarify, if ur looking to dig deeper into the big picture stuff, such as the relations between the Republic and the Trade Federation and Nubula Front, or Palpetine, then this is a 4 star book.Other than that, if u want a character driven story look somewhere else. The only interesting characters in this book to follow are Palpetine, for his subtle scheming and Captain Cohl who is a hard nosed mercenary working against the Republic. All the jedi are quite one dimensional even though they take up 1/2 the book. The main Jedi here is Qui Gon who is intent to catch Cohl. The author does touch on why Qui Gon is a sort of mavrick in Jedi circles, but would have been interesting to see more of this and less Yoda/Windu babble."
3,The best of Luceno's Star Wars books nice lead into E1,"James Luceno's prequal to Episode I, Cloak of Deception is the best of the pre classic Star Wars tales to be written. It's exciting with interesting characters, well-written movie tie-ins and overall simply a fun read. The interaction between Obi-wan and Qui-Gon is very well done as is the continuing introduction of Vergere. The story revolves around a comment made in Episode I when Senator Palpatine refers to the Chancellor as being engulfed by ""baseless accusations of corruption"", this story tells how these accusations came to pass, as well as the simultaneous story of how Nute Gunray came to power. Its filled with Jedi in the role of protectors, not as private investigators as seen in Rogue Planet or as diplomats as seen in The Approaching Storm. Here they are the guardians of peace and justice for the Republic. Luceno writes in a very different style from his New Jedi Order books, and it gives me hope for his next Star Wars work."
3,Politics Rule,"This is a good book that deals a lot with political intrigue. While I liked it, I found it a bit plodding and slow at times. A true fan will suffer through the slow spots. However, it does give a great insight to the Trade Federation and explains why the political scene is the way it is in Episode 1. Definately worth checking out!"
3,Fills inn som gaps!,"This book is interesting, but not the best Star Wars book! Since I'm collecting Star Wars paperbacks, (and some hardcover) this book does belong in my collection. It tells the background story for the upcoming trade blockade of Naboo, which was told in Episode I. It gives som background on how Lord Sidious manages to weaken the Chanceler's position, and pave the way for the election of Palpatine as Supreme Chancelor in the movie. It has a few surprises, and if you like Star Wars, give it a try.Knut J. Norway."
2,More plot than people,"I have admired James Luceno's work on the Robotech novels and he sets up the situation well, but it just declines gradually from there, becoming needlessly convoluted, melodramatic and predictible in the end. There is not alot of personal investment of the characters in their story. The story does not advance the mythology referring to the main characters--Obi-wan, Qui-Gonn, Anakin, or Amidala--even though they all make appearences. It is just the standard sword-fighting stuff. It could have been better if they would have just focused the main conflict down to Qui-Gonn and Obi-wan vs the antagonist--Cohl and his terrorist cell--to the bitter end. Perhaps they could have thrown in a Fallen Jedi or two on Cohl's side to make things really dramatic with a battle royale at the end. Rogue Planet is the best of the Star Wars, with Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter coming in second. This one is a distant third. Basically, it was more political plot than people."
3,"Slow, unconnected","An amazingly slow piece of work that takes forever to get anywhere, and makes you wonder why you got there. Yet somehow the random good scenes with Qui-Gon make it somewhat interesting. It seems at times to be a mix of random books jammed together, each a little bit interesting but together not very satisfying."
4,Good political intrigue,"Very interesting read about the days leading up to episode 1. Faithful to the series, an entertaining read to say the least"
1,Political thriller?!?!,THis book was sad for a star wars book it was what they call a politocal thriller and i didnt like it it was a boring book that didit deserve the large gold letters star wars
3,Read Like Homework,"My ongoing quest for knowledge of the force prompted me to purchase this novel. The story explains some of the events that occurred in The Phantom Menace, but after completing the book I felt like I had been reading a homework assignment in a textbook. In my opinion James Luceno does not adequately place the reader in the action. Throughout the novel I felt like I was reading the story after the fact. The writing did not grab and hold my attention, and I was unable to become part of the story.For the die-hard Star Wars fan, the information in this novel is vital to the events leading up to the Clone War. There is a plot twist in the book that will surprise, but it seemed like it took forever to get to it.For the casual reader I do not recommend this book. If you are not intrigued by the events of the Star Wars saga this book will only be marginally entertaining. I do however recommend Shadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul) by Michael Reaves. A very thrilling novel it is!"
2,"A little slow, but some good background information","This book focuses on the political antics of the Galactic Senate and the dealings of some if the individual senators. It focuses on the wheelings and dealings of Senator Palpatine and how he underminds everything in the Senate. If you want to know about how the Senate falls this is a very good book. I have not enjoyed the prequel books as much as I have the post-Jedi series. To me, this book was a little slow and took me a while to read because there was never really a point in which it ""grabbed"" me and made me want to read more. I did finish it and would say that you can read it for information but you do not need to read it to understand any of the story."
3,"Decent story, mediocre writing","Overall, I enjoyed the story. It was a good explanation of events leading to The Phantom Menace. There were unexpected plot twists that eventually pulled me into it, but it took over 100 pages to get there. I think the main reason is that the descriptions were very bare bones. I life for stories to paint a vivid picture, but all I got was a basic sense of things. In order to care what is happening, it helps to care about the characters, and this story really didn't make me feel any connection to them. If I hadn't seen The Phantom Menace, I probably would've stopped reading the book. There are other better Star Wars books out there--of the approximately 10 I've read, this was my least favorite."
3,"Not bad..not great either, but not bad","I found all the internal politics and workings of the Senate and such to be a little slow and boring at times, but it was interesting to see the formative steps leading up to what would be Valorum's Downfall in Attack of the Clones and what lead to the blockade of trade with Naboo in the Phantom Menace.Sidious's machinations are the undercurrent of the entire book, even though he's really not the soul focus, but it's how he sets the wheels in motions and everyone's reactions to his plans, once set in motion, that is really what the book is about.It was also nice to see Qui Gon have a good portion of pages dedicated to him as well in this book. A really great character that, like darth maul, wasn't fully realized in the films.As i said, I found the politics at times to be a little slow which brought the book down a little bit for me. But overall, a solid Star Wars read."
3,"Not bad, a pretty brainless fun read.",I have read almost all of the SW universe novels... this one wasnt bad... pretty brainless adventure story.
4,Great Story,"This story was amazing. it kept me entertained all the way through. it satisfies both action and political lovers of star wars. The story also explains how the politics of the Star Wars universe work. it also gives a great insight on Qui Gon's view of the force and how Chancellor Valorum ran the senate.The only thing i wished this book included was more of the agenda of Darth Sideous, even though that is obvious. He was hardly mentioned, even though it is his plans being put into action. But overall, a really well done book."
3,"Where is the original soundtrack for ""Four Sons""?","Why did Fox choose to eliminate ""Four Son""s original Movietone soundtrack?The film was originally released with synchronized music and sound effectsincluding several brilliant limited uses of dialogue. Couldn't the original score be offered as an option? A true botch job in an otherwiseexcellent set."
5,Finally Ford's silents on DvD,"I was really happy when I found out the Fox would be releasing ""offical"" editions of some of John Ford's silent classics. It's interesting to see the German Expressionism a la F. W. Murnau pop up in such films as Hangman's House and Four Sons, with a dose of John Ford comedy in each. I had not seen Just Pals before getting the set and was pleasantly surprised at how good and John Ford like he was at the very begining of his directorial career. Both the Iron Horse and Bad Men give us early examples of the John Ford epic western. I liked tthe extras and wished that there were commentaries on all of the movies, not just the Iron Horse.A note about the music: I felt that the new scores worked rather well for the films, but I wished that they would have included the movietone scores (Four Sons) as well. But that is only a minor quibble in an otherwise excellent set."
4,Nice for the price,"It was nice to find a comforter set made specifically for a daybed at a reasonable price. However, the quality is not as good as I expected. It had loose strings everywhere. The bedskirt touches the floor on one side but doesn't on the other side by about 2 inches. The same with the comforter. It is definitely not symmetrical. And the comforter has more fill in some areas than in others.Overall, I am giving it a 4 rating as it serves its purpose in a spare room and it cost $150 plus shipping. I would recommend the photo be updated to reflect the cream color in the comforter. I expected the set to look like the picture and was disappointed at the almost beige color. I wanted that white/black contrast for my room."
4,Worth the read,"This book is written and paced well. Some interesting tales are contained within, and it provides a good general summary of the Boeing-Airbus battle. It was a bit light on real analysis, but still insightful."
1,Very dated in 2008!,"I bought the book hoping for insight into the boeing vs. airbus story, the sub-title of the book. Unfortunately, it started much earlier in the early days of civilian aviation. Though I feel the insider perspective to the industry, the books is pretty dry reading.The last part looked hopeful when Lynn began to get into the direct competition between Europe and the US over jet sales, but so much has changed since the book was written almost 10 years ago. Airbus now has the 380, Boeing is working on its new plane. It's quite dated now and not worth the time. Glad I picked it up on sale."
2,Catchy title hides plodding story,"Research may have been meticulous for this book, although you cannot tell from the poor editing and proofreading. So far as I can tell, the story is accurate and the discussion reasonably complete, but I cannot imagine that you could not find a better-written account of the battle of these two giants. Besides, things have already changed since the birds of prey circled each other for this book."
3,"Nice insight, but too casual to be a serious book","Sometimes I felt that I was reading a thriller which was good, because I had to read the book for educational purposes. Problematic about the book is that the author is taking a very casual approach on the matter, which lets me wonder if I can trust the analysis presented in the book completely. If he would have sticked more with the bare facts, I might have more of a trust in his conclusions. Especially in the beginning, I felt that he was taking too much of an American view on the battle between Airbus and Boeing. I changed my opinion a little bit on this towards the end, but I still believe that his choice of expressions should be more conservative and serious. What is good about the book, is that it shows that the airline industry is full of politics and how the Europeans have developed a successful industry out of nothing."
3,"Left me at 35,000 Feet","Since I have read a great deal on Boeing (ie, Widebody by Irving), Lynn brought nothing new to the table from Seattle, except for glossed over stories. I haven't read a great deal on the consortium from Toulouse. Are the facts as shallow here too? Additionally, would spell check have been an ordeal? Needless to say, I enjoyed the book because it gave me an idea of the fight between these two ""subsidized"" groups. It could have been better, but it was sufficient to pass the daily commute."
2,Recommended only for the complete aviation novice.,"Although mildly entertaining, this book suffers from poor writing, including many grammatical errors. Lynn has a habit of repeating himself in certain areas, then contradicting himself in other areas. My impression was that neither Lynn nor his editors actually read the finished product before publication.The insight into the Boeing and Airbus management, and the characters that define their companies' histories, almost make this worth a read. This was tempered, however, with egregious factual errors that I was very disappointed with. The book seemed rushed- as if reporting the facts was less important than the idea of an industrial and geo-political war of two titans."
1,Flawed premise,"The author's whole premise is flawed. Fr. Seraphim Rose always emphatically stated that the ""toll-houses"" are METAPHORICAL, to illustrate a GENERAL teaching (and there's plenty of patristic and liturgical reference to the METAPHORICAL tollhouses within Orthodoxy well before the modern age). Thus sweeping accusations of ""gnosticism"" are pointless. I suggest any serious inquirer read Fr. Seraphim's writings himself."
1,The toll houses ARE NOT A MYTH,"It is a pity so many write about Orthodoxy theology, yet have very little experience of Orthodoxy in the sense of the Holy Fathers and Elders. Yet Father Seraphim is an Elder of Orthodoxy who clearly draws his understanding of the toll houses from true Orthodox understanding, not a westernized rational approach. The toll houses certainly exist. The Orthodox believe that it can take up to 40 days for the soul to ascend through the different toll houses, which is why for centuries and centuries the 40 day memorial services have been held for the departed souls. The great monasteries of Mt Athos have many icons depicting the journey of the soul through the toll houses. Be aware of what you read today that goes under the guise of Orthodox."
1,the toll house truth,"everything is a myth when sincere faith and love for the lord no longer guides your soul.Father Seraphim Rose was a beloved friend of the lord,a holy man with a heart overflowing with truth.Persecuted by his own in life and persecuted also after death.But such is the way of the righteous.The toll house was experienced by a no of orthodox saints and documented by them.As one who was enlightened by the truth of the holy spirit,father Seraphim documented these truths."
3,It's Brazilian Portuguese,"One reason I bought this was that the alternative admitted up front it was Brazilian Portuguese. Well, so is this one, or at least the one shipped to us had a little ""Brazilian"" sticker on it. Our Portuguese friends tell us they are much the same, so I guess it'll do, but full disclosure would've been nice. More later, maybe, after we've used it."
1,A Rare Clunker for Laurel and Hardy,"After a promising start, ""Be Big"" (1931) milks a single routine way beyond its breaking point. Despite Stan and Ollie's best efforts, the laughs are virtually nonexistent. Three reels wasted in one of the team's worst films."
5,Excellent indoor fountain,This is a great quality fountain which adds a nice touch to the theme of our breakfast nook. The sound of the water is very relaxing and the sea shell design is extremely decorative. Has functioned flawlessly for quite awhile now.
5,best water fountain,bought this fountain for a tropical wedding and used it on the food table. it was very well commented on and worked great! very happy!
1,Ouchy,"Like the helmet - light weight, comfortable, both warm and cool, but I found out that the way the hard plastic shell wraps around the foam at the rim leaves no padding to a forehead impact. A face plant on a groomer left me with a huge goose egg and a spectacular black eye. Probably would not have had any problems with no helmet at all, but the Fuse concentrated the impact to a single point on my forehead."
4,Great Helmet,"I've used this helmet for about 12-15 days of skiing so far. I find that it is comfortable, light enough in weight, warm enough, but not overly so. When it is really cold, you can use the removable ear pieces, close the top vents, and wear a thin balaclava under the helmet. When it is much warmer, you can remove the ear pieces, open the top vents, and do without the balaclava. Really, very comfortable and I think it looks great too."
4,"Good, almost really good!","Largely hit, partial miss on this disc.There are the high points: (That's Not Good Enough For Me, Early Sunday Morning, Don't Care If I Never See You)The brilliant points: (I'll Be There, Close My Eyes, Wishing, Until I See You Again) and the misses: (Way Deep Down, Lollipop Jungle) which are not bad songs. They just sound unfinished.Worth having, but would have been better with less songs and more time spent in the studio. Some of the songs sound like they were rushed through and could have been great with a little more care & time spent on them.Not perfect, but the songs I mentioned were high points or brilliant are terrific. Don't know why anyone would rate this below three stars..."
1,Are you kidding me?,"In case you're wondering - Yes, this knob works on a typical standing lamp. I don't know why those cylinder-type replacement knobs are so damn hard to find, but this does function as a (rather bulky) substitute thanks to the 3 adapter pieces. However, I would strongly advice AGAINST purchasing this item from Jasco Products. It's actually a General Electric product that you can get for seventy-eight cents ($0.78!) at your local Walmart."
5,Great Product,"This is a great product for the average person who just needs a little help organizing their life, schedules, and notes."
2,You get what you pay for,"The add was correct, except it doesn't work right, I didn't send it back b/c it is just so cute."
5,Execllent,To understand the Vietnam War or any war this book should be a must read. Why didn't our leaders of that time do so remains a mystery to me.
5,A fantastic read about Indochina,"A great read about the daily horrors faced by the French forces in Indochina.I thought I'd read most of what was written about the horrors that were faced daily by the French army, and later the Americans, but this book told me things that I'd never read before. The pure, unadulterated and pointless misery of the French soldiers. The inevitable idiocy of the generals who were no shining examples of military brilliance. Packed with great insights that I discovered from reading this book. Why did the Americans not read this before they went 'in country'? Very highly recommended."
5,BROKEN HEARTED STORY OF VALIANT MEN,"A heartrending tale of the French experience in IndoChina during the 20 years prior to US arrival there. Poignantly written, the Author- a university professor - spent his summers in VietNam in combat with the French troops. Incidentally: He also died there - KIA with the men of whom he so eloquently wrote. As a Marine myself, with some field experience, I was deeply touched by the story he tells. It's a story of unfliching valiance on the part of the enlisted men of the French forces - and unbending stupidity on the part of their senior leaders. Absolutely heartbreaking and maddening at the same time. Fall takes you there. Highly recommended. Oorah. And Semper Fi to those valiant hearts who epitomize selflessness in an otherwise selfish age - our servicemen and women - then and now."
5,How Soon We Forgot!,"The French involvement in Vietnam or Indochina has always been fascinating. France vainly tried to hang on to its far-flung and difficult to administer far eastern colonies after WW II without success. Bernard Fall was by far the expert on this endeavor and explains the intracasies and operations conducted by France in this failed attempt at maintaining their grip on their doomed colonialism. The book is extremely detailed, insightful, and tactically precise. This book should have been commited to memory by our military and political leaders during the early to middle 60s. We may not have repeated the historical mistakes, or maybe it was fate that we did. Once you are finished with this book, immediately read Fall's ""Hell in A Very Small Place."" It is as equally excellent."
5,A warning unheeded,"It's heartbreaking to think how differently the twentieth century might have ended had the powers that be in the U.S. read and, more importantly, paid attention to this book. Bernard Fall describes brilliantly the strategy and tactics used by Vo Nguyen Giap and the Viet Minh against the French. These tactics changed very little from one war to the next yet we, forewarned (assuming we had read this book), walked right into it.This is a classic example of the old axiom that he who fails to learn from history is doomed to repeat it.What I found particularly disturbing about `Street Without Joy ` is Giap's description of the evolution of his enemies' tactics; an initial offensive, slowing and turning into a defensive war with a growing amount of public sentiment against involvement. Does this sound familiar?"
5,One of The Best. Of Viet Nam,This is one of the best books anyone will ever read on Viet Nam. It covers the French attempt to beat the forces of Uncle Ho. The book details the slow but sure beating of the French forces by a far less supplied nationalistic force that were to become the Viet Cong and North Viet regulars. The French tried to set up strong points around to control the country. It didn't work. It is too bad none of our military leaders took this book to heart as it details our own defeat because we did not learn the lesson taught by the French. They said we would lose and we did. The author was killed in Viet Nam not long after the book came out. Do yourself a favor and get it.I think you will be glad you did.
5,A great solo effort from Annie Haslam,"This was Annie's major label effort with a full band and it was a gem. ""Moonlight Shadow"" has remained a concert favorite to this day. ""Further from Fantasy"" also very popular. Annie really hits the high notes on ""Wishing On A Star"" and this is one of the best showcases for her voice since Ashes are Burning. This is an essential must have for fans of Renaissance and Annie Haslam."
4,Another side of Annie,"So you love Rennaissance and Annie Haslam's perfect voice? Well, here's a chance to get to know another side of her singing talents. This album is a great collection of up-beat songs that provides some very pleasant listening and stretches her voice in different directions. The best track is Further from Fantasy, one of my favorites by a female singer. But it's all good, although I could probably have done without Moonlight Shadow as it's so similar to Maggie Reilly's original version."
4,Worth it!,"This book is not bulky, yet covers a variety of important toddler topics. It has greatly influenced many of my parenting choices. It is an easy read that proves to be an essential for any parents wishing to be informed and assured."
2,"Informative, but how will it look in my garden?","Although the information in the book is detailed, more pictures are needed to give some idea how these trees and shrubs might actually enhance a garden. The photos contained in the book are sparse and are entirely in black and white. Pictures in books? Generally not needed, but in a gardening book, good graphics are essential."
3,Mother Goose,"My 2yr old daughter enjoys this video. She asks to play ""Humpty Wall"" though she did not like it the first time. The only thing I don't like is that it's not a continuous movie-separate for each of the tales."
1,Don't waste your $$$$$,I've always used Avery Glossy or Office Depot Glossy card stock and produced beautiful cards. I decided to try the Xerox Glossy Card Stock because I always thought Xerox was a good product. Horrible! Spend the extra few dollars and buy quality card stock.
5,Great soft-rock worship music,This disc has some really great tunes. I play it at night when I'm sick to feel close to the Lord. I was introduced to this CD through the Praise & Worship choir I'm in. We have done 3 or 4 or the songs in our service. A must-have for Contempory Praise music.
5,"very comfortable, good coverage","I bought this for outdoor swimming, and it was comfortable. The sleeve goes down pretty far. The neck is fairly high without feeling like it's choking you. (I'm a woman, but I bought this one because I needed the size.)It does not seem eager to air-dry, and I felt like I had to take it off right after swimming--it just felt as if it was going to stay wet. I have NO idea why it's called ""rash guard"", since the purpose seems to be to avoid sunburn, but I'm sure I would have developed a rash if I had left it on wet.The service was extremely fast, even though I did not pay for express shipping."
4,Nice Mix,"I like this mix. The only thing is the mix starts of a little slow to me, but I have noticed the Ron has away of building up to a climax...I equate a good house mix to sex. You have the foreplay, then you really get into it and them the climax. As much as I love Amel, Ron's remix sounds a bit out of place. Other than that the mix will get you moving."
1,bad,"its very bad its arrive damaged from inside all the parts insid is very dry and when i start to use it i heard a sound like blastic broken and when i opend to see inside it i found piecies of broken blastic and i can not use it HP LaserJet 1100 - Printer - B/W - laser - Legal, A4 - 600 dpi x 600 dpi - up to 8 ppm - capacity: 125 sheets - ParallelSold by: isoldit.mn062 (seller profile)thats from where i got it"
2,printer cable requested poorly assesed,I received printer and requested cable person sent me the wrong cable and i have been not able to use itIt is astonishing that the person selling me this printer has sent me the wrong cable and now i cant use it
2,Pointless & Boring,"Just because it has nearly all-gay characters or because the characters are cute doesn't make this film entertaining.I would like to say what it lacks in polish it makes up for in story, but there isn't one. A bunch of gay guys get their heads cut off. By whom and why? This isn't covered in the movie. I'm not even sure why this movie was made, and am sorely disappointed if this is the best they can come up with.It's probably worth a rental for the mindless idiocy of it all and to see the cute guys flirt with each other. But don't expect much at all.Rites of Passage (a DVD that I just reviewed) affected and scared me a lot more (and entertained me a lot more) than this dud."
1,Not very helpful,I felt that the class was very elementary and I didn't learn very much when I watched it.
3,do not buy this laptop you can do better,"I had this laptop for a year now and when i bought i didnt really look around for a better laptop i bought this one for about 950 with fingerprint scanner an mic. Within a week after I bought this laptop I saw way better laptops about 100 dollers cheaper. Now im not saying this is a bad laptop but you can do better.Lets start looking at whats bad about this lap topone its really uncomfortable on my lap with the big battery and the headphones digging up my chesttwo it overheats like crazythree the whole computer in my openion is oversized(but i knew that before i bought this laptop).but there are some good things about this laptop.one its vistatwo it remembers your logon username and password if you get the fingerprint scannerthree fairley fastand finally four looks nice, love the blue lights surrounding the keyboard and the design on the computer.So not that bad of a computer but shop around you can find a better laptop"
5,Excellent laptop,"I bought this laptop because I liked its design. Besides it's fast, efficient and sufficiently small to be transported wherever I want. Excellent product from HP."
2,Stay Away,"After a month using this laptop intensively, I'm returning it. First and foremost, the keyboard is falling apart. Several of the keys are now squeaking when I hit them, and my ctrl key is all but useless - it sticks. That means I can't use hot keys which is critical. Second, my iTunes audio skips freqently and my MS Office programs are prone to take 10-15 second naps when I'm editing. Very lame. I tried an HP because it seemed like a good value, but now I know why - they took shortcuts, including and especially some of the hardware. I'm going back to Toshiba."
4,Wow! Talk about different!,"Gogol Bordello played at Van's Warped Tour. I can't believe that. I don't like most Warped Tour bands, but I just can't believe that Gogol didn't get booed of the stage. It would seem like Warped Tour's emo kids would strongly dislike Gogol's bizarre mix of punk, gypsy music, reggae & ska, house, and psychedelia. Whatever. But Gogol Bordello is the most original and refreshing band I have heard in a long time. This is one of my new favorite bands."
2,"Uh, trying too hard.","These guys, at least on this album, are trying too hard (in my opinion) to cater to a certain audience. No need to name your album after the style of music you are playing. Granted, I am not familiar with their previous album, but this sounds like a mediocre attempt to re-create the Inferno sound.If you want the real deal, skip this nonsense and head straight for the World/Inferno Friendship Society. I promise, you'll like it more. Particularly the album ""Just the Best Party"" and the new one, ""Red-Eyed Soul"""
4,start wearing purple,I bought this CD for one song and so far only really like that song ('Start Wearing Purple'). It shipped fine and was in a good condition upon arrival.
4,Gypsy. The New Punk?,"Ukranian Eastern European New York gypsy immigrant punk cabaret, sung in broken English by Eugene Hutz [who needs an exorcist] and played with ferocious intensity by his merry men and women. The most thrilling CD I've heard all year - you'll be singing along although you'll have no idea exactly what you are saying. My grade: A"
4,Hot Band!,"They are Feisty, have a Zest for life and have blended different kinds of music into one big original sound. Their lyrics are not too shabby, not shabby at all. Have to say that I am very happy knowing this band and own two of their albums, this one and I forgot the name for the one they released after. Both very good purchases. They are original and that counts for a lot of my respect. When they get going is a brilliant display of talent. These guys are the real deal, worth every dollar. Highly entertaining and their message is one that screams: Enjoy Life, Enjoy Music and it will all work out for the better. 4 shinning stars for Gogol Bordello /Gypsy Punks Underdog World Strike! Hot Band!"
5,Best Band In The World,"Gogol Bordello: Not only is this my favorite CD of all time, it opened me up to so many new areas. Eugene Hutz is a genius and his band match him with their skill and enthusiasim. Every band should wish they were this band, and every CD should be so lucky to have as many perfect songs as this one. I love it. I would marry it."
5,Gogol Boredello- Underdog World Strike,"This album sits rightfully in its place on the evolutionary chain of progression for Gogol Bordello. There is less sax than heard on the beginning album, Voi-La Indturder, but far more violin ripping its way into a chant. Some of these songs will stay in your mind for days and as you repeat the riffs and inspiring, revolutionary lyrics on your lips, you will rise and begin to dance...There is a version of ""Start Wearing Purple"" different than that on Voi-La Intruder. I thought that composition and magic of Multi Contra Vs. Irony would be impossible to beat, but it has competition. If you are an existing fan of Gogol Bordello or if you have never been exposed to gypsy punk cabaret, then pick this album up, you will not regret it."
3,Better in person.,"Good party band, and great to see in person. I can only listen to the album for so long before I'm ready to give it a break."
4,"Useful, BUT...","I like this book. It's great to have all these Magic cards in just one volume, instead of so many seperate ones. However, there are some problems.They didn't bother to update the earlier parts, for starters. Thus, many of the erratas are out-of-date. Also, many times it'll make references to page numbers--but the things are no longer there. To top it all off, it says that 4th Edition is the newest set...then it says that 5th Edition is the newest set...then it says that 6th Edition is the newest set...then that 7th Edition is the newest set. Also, I would have liked to see Odyssey, Torment, and Judgment in here.Still, despite all these problems, as I said, this IS a good book. But don't bother buying it if you have all the other volumes."
4,Great for what it is but lacking for what its missing,"Well Hey, Its a GREAT book for what it is. I ordered it a couple days ago and its already helped me alot. Only thing is that, Although Published in Oct 2002, its missing Odyssey, Torment, Judgement, and Onslaught. I can see it missing Onslaught but in my opinion The other three are uncalled for. THEY SHOULD BE INCLUDED. Oh well I guess we'll have to waitfor the next guide."
4,better for advanced students,the video is great for seeing how the poses are supposed to look (shot from smart angles that allow you to see his whole body). my problem with it is that it's hard to know what to do with yourself if you are just starting out trying to learn the primary series. this dvd doesn't give a lot of information on how to take it slowly into the poses for beginners (no options for less advanced positions).
2,Hard to believe...,"It's hard to believe that a publisher could sell books that are so full of mistakes. I have had problems with this book, their NT workstation 4 guide, their Test Yourself Practice Exams and their MCSE Personal Training Center. I wish I had read the reviews for these materials before I wasted my money on them. I ended up needing to buy other books so I felt comfortable passing the exams. I haven't failed any yet, but I wasted a lot of time proof-reading their material and having to reference other guides for clarity. As an aside, the best luck I've had so far has been with guides published by IDG Books, specifically those written by Alan Carter."
1,"Inaccurate, and too many authors","If you are very careful, you can glean value from this book. If you are not a pedant like myself, it will probably cause you to fail your exam. Example referring to the difficult area of registry entries (p198): ""DatabaseCleanupInterval Specifies the interval in minutes for the time to remove expired client records from the database Default = 864000 (24 hours)"". This figure is the number of 1/10s of a second in a 24-hour period. I still do not know what units are required by NT for this figure.Also, the number of authors make this book a laughing-stock. Example: Table 7.1 is identical to Table 8.1. Was the author of chapter 8 unaware of the contents of chapter 7? Sadly, I think the answer is yes."
1,Not recommended,"I generally don't like ""MCSE QuickPass Cheat Books."" They're not the best way to learn a product. However, I bought this book because I needed a brush-up review on how MS does TCP/IP for the exam. I was thoroughly disappointed. The book does not go into enough detail for the beginner, and the text contained several points that were just wrong. To pass the exam, I'd recommend a classic TCP/IP book (such as the W. Richard Stevens set) coupled with MS's whitepapers on DHCP, WINS and other MS-specific stuff. In short, save your money...this guide is a real dog."
4,For Subnetting...Get This Book,"This book uses an easy to understand, step-by-step approach to explaining subnets and subnet masks. If you cannot get a grasp of the subject from other books, you would do yourself a favor by reading Chapters 3 and 4 in this edition. The rest of the book is also layed out very well. The subjects are not shoved down your throat like most other books do (esp. MS Press TCP/IP). Although there are not great test prep questions in this book, if you supplement with a test prep book(Readiness Review for TCP/IP) you will do fine on the test.If you do not understand TCP/IP after reading this book, please stay away from any LAN/WAN. You ain't gonna' get it!"
1,Don't put this one in your backpack.,"If you already know enough to take the exam and merely want an expensive refresher, then this might be the book for you. If, however, you are intending to actually learn from this book, forget it. Find another.The information is sketchy and disorganized. The sections are repeatedly interrupted with ""alerts"" that break the continuity of the information.Answers to the unrealistic self-tests are frequently incorrect. Grammar mistakes abound. The two-minute drills are verbatim from the chapter instead summarizing the text in fresh words. There are no memory tips or learning tricks."
1,numerous errors,"I am working to my MCSE and have passed every test on the first try, I get this book and I fail the last and final exam! This book has numerous errors, and should be recalled! Save your money - I lost the money for the test and the book, don't make the same mistake. Now that winters here maybe I can use it for firewood. Good luck."
1,Save your cash and buy another study guide.,"I'm not a big fan of study guides. They're great because, unlike manuals, they tell you what to concentrate on for the test. However, most of them are rushed to press with tons of errors and incorrect information. This is a very good example of one of the worst.This book seems to have been written by four or five authors, each with a different writing style and (apparently) skill level. THe chapter on DHCP was great, but the chapters on subnetting, DNS and other topics were sorely lacking. I supplemented my knowledge with a textbook on TCP/IP and the relevant RFCs. In conclusion, save your money. It's not worth it."
1,Avoid this book if you don't know subnetting.,The chapter on subnetting should be considered criminal. Wrong address ranges are used to demonstrate subnet masking which would leave a newcommer to subnetting completely confused. If you can catch the errors you know enough about subnetting to answer the subnetting questions in the exam. I will credit the book though for forcing me to go to more athoritatize sources to fully understand sub and super-netting. After the subnetting fiasco I didn't trust the rest of the book so I can't comment on the other subjects. I spite of this book I was able to score 965 on the TCP/IP test.
3,Good but some missing points...,"This book does a very good job at teaching you the core of tcp/ip. But it misses a couple of points. Like tcp/ip printing and the different types of DNS servers(forwarder, secondary, cache-only.) And those points represent 4 or 5 questions in the exams. I used this book in conjunction with Exam Cram from Coriollis and I scored 982! on the exam. So the combo of those 2 books is a sure winner. Also, the book only use black and white, it really could use some colors."
4,Captures True Jazz Spirit of 50's-60's,"Years after my dad died, I inherited his collection of jazz LPs. This album was one of the gems of the bunch. It features a Brubeck- and Desmond-led quartet appearing before an enthusiastic Oberlin College audience and captures the spirit of the late 1950's-early 1960's jazz community perfectly. As Desmond and Brubeck lilt their way through alternating melodies, as the audience claps approvingly after each solo, you may find yourself with closed eyes, bobbing your head side to side, imagining yourself in a funky little coffee shop, sporting a small, black beret, balancing a set of bongo drums between your knees."
3,2 Italians meet a wanna be actress,"Not a bad film. Not sure why an ""R"" unless for the little 3way scene that occurs towards the end. You do see a little male flesh, there are some homoerotic scenes and the two guys are dark haired, hot Italian types, their girlfriend is so-so, needs some acting lessons. Two thumbs up for the guys! Concerns boyhood chums who go separate ways, later meet up, with one being an undercover cop trying to break up the mob that his friend is part of. Like I said the plot is so-so, the main reason to see this one is if you like dark haired muscular guys, sexual situations, etc."
1,reads like a blog...,"I tried to like this book, I really did, especially since I'm also a SAHM in Germany, but it just didn't happen. Why? I'm not really sure. It might have something to do with Ms. Hohlbaum's writing style. Like I said, it's bloglike, as if her thoughts were constantly being interrupted by her two small children. There are, indeed, lots of mom blogs on the internet (which one can read for far less money than the price of this book)and hers is certainly not the funniest. I was also hoping that the book would deliver on its title and provide amusing anecdotes about what it's like to be a SAHM in Europe, but she mostly failed me there as well. I believe with all my heart that mothers of small children should be supported in their pursuit to nurture themselves, entertain their muses and maintain their professional acumen. The end result, however, should be something other than boring, unfunny prose."
1,Terribly disappointing,"Being a SAHM in Europe, too, I had high hopes for this book. But the jokes seem to be missing their punchlines, the ""touching"" stories are trite, and all the while the author seems to be trying just a little bit too hard. And why bother mentioning she's in Europe at all? She could be anywhere for the amount she has discussed her host country's culture or quirks and how they affect her life as a SAHM.I can read this kind of thing, only better, on the internet, for free."
2,Not European Enough for Me,"I am planning on being a stay-at-home mom in Europe and thought this book would be a perfect read. The author, however, could easily be writing from her home anywhere in America. The chapters seem to end abruptly and the punchlines just aren't funny. I'd suggest reading Vicki Iovine's books!"
2,dissapointing...,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, but have to say I'm really dissapointed. For one, it's really not that funny, but what bothered me more was all the stereotypes. The picture she paints of Germany sounds more like Germany 50 years ago, not today.Save your money!"
2,Hard Kandi,"When it comes to writing about drama in young-adult relationships, no lyricist comes close to Kandi Burruss these days. Songs like TLC's ""No Scrubs,"" Destiny's Child's ""Bills, Bills, Bills,"" and Mariah Carey's ""X-Girlfriend"" will make you nod your head in agreement or make you wince. Her frank and honest lyrics don't beat around the bush, and they show that Kandi herself may have had her share of drama in relatiosnhips. I bought the album, hoping she would expand a bit and reach beyond the ""my-man-is-a-loser"" lyrics. The album's true gem is ""Don't Think I'm Not,"" which is about a scorned lover who gets revenge on a cheating man by ""getting hers,"" too. But after a half-dozen like songs that whine about ""how-my-trifiling-man-did-me-wrong,"" things get one-dimensional and predictable really fast. One has to wonder how she even ends up with these men in the first place. In any case, she may call herself Kandi, but this debut CD is hardly a confection."
2,AC adapter,This adapter is bulkier and takes up more space on an outlet than the smaller Nokia brand adapters. The adapter seems to be of less quality than other adapters.
3,No Problem,I have experienced no problems with this charger. I have rarely had to use it. The lithium-ion battery last a long time.
3,Defective DVDs,"I love this series and finally ordered all 5 seasons. I have spent the last 2 weeks watching them in Quantum Leap Bliss. The show itself is wonderful; however, I had problems with the manufacturing of the DVD's themselves. Each season had at least one disk with problems (i.e. missing bonus features, episodes that won't play in the ""play all"" mode, but will if you access it from the ""episode index,"" episodes where the show gets hung up, then starts, then gets hung up, then starts, and on and on, and episodes that won't play at all (black screen), etc. I have just done the ""exchange"" process through Amazon and hope the next set they send me will not have this problem, but that means I'll have to watch 5 seasons again in a short amount of time in order to view them all before the 30-day return period ends (in case the new set has similar problems). If there were not any problems with the disks, I would have rated this a 5-star."
2,This is virtually worthless,"I read a lot of good reviews on this product and I don't know what these people were thinking. I bought this to supplement my learning and it was not helpful because this cd is actually an intro cd for various languages and not just Vietnamese. Saying that, there's not much material on Vietnamese at all. I was very disappointed. This cd does not discuss gramar and has very limited vocabulary. I highly disapprove of this cd for anyone learning Vietnamese."
5,fast learning,"This system seems a little aqward at first, but it is trulyamazing what you are learning and don't even realize it untillyou hear Vietnamese people talking and you know what is beingsaid.This system however, is not so much for one who wants to visitbut more for the person who really wants to learn the languagein its entirity."
5,Heartwarming,"This is a heart warming book. The author recounts the year with children at the Freedom School in a manner that is insightful and deeply moving. I could picture the children in my head. Teachers and parents will both benefit from this truly beautiful book, the dedication and patience of the teachers at the school, and also the struggles of both parents and students from the urban environment the school is located in. When I finished the book I was sad to let go of the children and their stories, and could not shake the nagging question, ""if it works in a place like this, why not everywhere?"" You may ask yourself the same thing."
2,yawn,"I really like memoirs and I really tried to like this one, but I can't. Starting with the rambling prologue all through to the end, nothing stayed with me. The writing was not solid and was underdeveloped. Sorry"
5,Great Album,My husband and I are big Vivaldi fans and this album was a wonderful surprise. It's not always easy to tell if an album is going to be good by listening to the small samples available online. The price here was so good that I decided to take a chance and download it. It's great! I would recommend it to anyone who likes baroque music in general and Vivaldi in particular.
3,Ok but cracked...,"I like the product, its too bad it had a slight crack on the bottom base. I decided to keep it rather than send it back. As so many others here have stated, its less of a hassle.The drawers glide nicely even loaded up but the computer that packages these should definitely consider a quality review because I have read where so many have been delivered cracked."
5,Great item,"I purchased 2 chests to provide extra drawer storage for a closet in a room I use as a den, TV and sewing room. The chest is sturdy, drawers operate smoothly and close completely. The drawers are roomy.I particularly liked that it was shipped assembled. Both arrived from Amazon in perfect condition.Thanks, Amazon!!!"
2,suncast storage trends 3-drawer cabinet,"Suncast C3703 Storage Trends 3-Drawer CabinetI love ordering from amazon but I have to say Wal-mart got you on the gray trend 3-drawer cabinet price. your price--$119.99 Wal-mart--$89.97 Wal-mart pricing is outrageous, but this time you have went overboard on your pricing. Why pay $30 more for the same thing. It's totally ridiculous."
1,Don't Bother,"This CD was recommended to my daughter from her child psychologist. it was a total waste of money. There is only 1 (one) meditiation on the CD. The rest of the CD tells parents why meditation is great. IMO, if you're already searching for a meditation for children CD, you already know you want it!"
4,The Little Love Book,"I recently got this book, and the Happiness one for a friend and myself. (2 love, 2 happiness) I would have to say that these are very 'cute' books. I am a beginner, and have found them to be very helpful for quick and easy spells. My friend id pleased with the books herself. I recommend them to beginners."
3,A cute book for any witch searching for love.,A wonderfully endearing little book full of easy-to-do spells that combine the mystical power of wishing with basic Wiccan rituals. My only warning is to heed Titania's advice and observe both the Wiccan Rede and the three-fold rule. Happy wishing!
5,Bring this book with you on your national park trip,"This is not a book to learn about photography. If you already know the basic of nature photography and plan to take photograph in national parks, this is what you need. It covers most of the more popular national parks. It shows you what to expect and what to photograph in each national park listed in the book, including best tripod locations and best time. Very organized and clear. The pictures and print quality are superb."
3,Quorthon is here!,"I think that ""Destroyer of worlds"" is a very good album.But i expected more things from Quorthon...The new album it's not good like the old albums like ""under the sign of the black mark"" or ""Hammerheart"".Buy it only if you are a Bathory fan!"
2,Not the quality I expected,"The down was not evenly dispersed. There wasn't ANY along the top squares, it seemed to be all along the bottom squares on the side. Couldn't ""shake"" the down to even it out. Wasn't worth it so I made a return."
2,A little on the light side,"I bought this a few months back. Unfortunately, it's not quite as warm as I had hoped. I can't picture it keeping anyone warm during winter if the house itself is not already warm inside. I think with down blankets you are really going to have to spend the extra money if you are looking to get something warm. Other than it being a little on the thin side it seemed fine other wise."
2,Starts out great...,"When I first got this, I loved it. It was a little heavier than I had thought (it felt kind of heavy on top of you), but now, 2 months later, all the down is at one end, and it's near-impossible to get it even.I suppose if you're willing to fluff this thing every night for a few minutes, you might be able to keep it even, but if you want something with low maintenance, try something else."
5,Like sleeping in a CLOUD,"this is a great comforter.....soft and fluffy....great pocketing for minimal shifting of feathers... for those people who have complained that there are too many feathers coming out....they must've never owned a down comforter...my $800 down comforter was the creme de la creme of comforters but it would still leak feathers. Although, i must say that the high thread count in this item makes the leakage very minimal."
4,Comforter,"So far I am very satisfied with this comforter. I have owned it for two months now. I thought the price was very good and it was shipped on time and in good order. I had read the reviews on Amazon, both positive and negative, prior to buying. I have not encountered any of the down feathers shifting or matting between the panels that was raised as a concern. I have to say that it is incredibly comfortable."
5,Very plush and elegant,I purchased this recently and would compare it to the finest I have experienced in exclusive 5 star hotels and then some. This is the best comforter I have had the pleasure of sleeping beneath but be sure it is sufficiently chilled in your room. This breathes very well for as thick as it is but it is a cold climate comforter so turn on the air con too very cool or use it in the winter if you are in a seasonal climate.
3,True Baffled Box construction?,"I bought this about a month ago and noticed just recently that the down shifts from box to box. if you hold the comforter up vertically, you'll notice that the ""true baffled box"" construction isn't true at all. there are 4 inch channels between all of the boxes, that allow the down to shift, causing most of the down to move to the corners. otherwise a very warm purchase, but the baffled box construction is a lie and causes heat loss from the middle of the comforter where you need it most."
1,nice..... for awhile......,"It really is a nice warm comforter, that is, for a few months. We've had ours exactly 1 year now; and after just a few months the feathers began relocating out of the ""true baffle boxes"" into every corner, and none were left in the middle. We've tried shaking and fluffing back into shape, but shortly after the same thing happens once again. It doesn't leak feathers outside, but it also doesn't act like a $300 baffle box comforter, which is why one would buy this- thinking the feathers would stay in place and not leak out of the sewn in boxes. Hmmm...Trying to find warranty info is a real chore- for royal velvet warranty info you can try calling John at 626-960-6096; Iconix now owns royal velvet and this is the person whom I was told to call. We'll see how the 15 year limited warranty holds up. We're truely disappointed and will think twice before buying this brand again."
2,Great at first but too much shifting of down!,"When I first got this comforter, we loved it. Very warm and fluffy. Only after a few months, the down shifted to the ends of the comforter and the middle is empty of down. Burrrrr. It is really hard to fluff the down back to the middle again and when you do, a month later, it has shifted again. This is not a ""baffle box"" design. I thought the whold idea of baffle box design was to keep the down from shifting!"
1,Ouch!,This movie was so bad it was funny!! But I do not think that was what the director was going for. What the hell was that sparkler that flew out of no where and vaporized the two soliders but some how did not burn up his drawing?? come on?!!?haha wow is all I have to say..What a bad movie!!!!
1,Sci-Fi movie or War movie,Enemies you can see. Meteors from Space. If only this would have taken place on The fifth moon of the Battaglia star system this movie would have made sense to me. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR A DECENT WAR MOVIE THEN DON'T MAKE A WAR MOVIE!!! It simple. p.s. try and do something that Saving Private Ryan and all it's endless clones have not.
2,Respect the effort,"I liked the effort and attempt of this film, but not the film overall. I respect the logistics behind gathering the vehicles, uniforms, weapons, etc. However, it reminds me of an interview with George Lucas where he criticized other Sci Fi movies who built elaborate sets and then spent a great deal of the movie showing off the set despite the fact that the story was not progressing. The story of Battaglia was nice, but this movie has been made before. For this competition I would like to see the film makers take more risks. This one did not. The story was formulaic and the dialogue was campy."
2,Ok for war movie junkies,"The film was pretty good although I don't have to much interest in war films. I just wish the acting was up to par, I found it a bit confusing too. I had too many questions and no answers."
2,Slow going,"I had a hard time getting through this, I think because the first few minutes I didn't really know who the characters were or what was going on. It was just kinda confusing. This seems to have the most money of all the films but the story really hurts it. It seems like the people who made it knows what they're doing, so maybe their next movie will be better."
3,Badge of courage,"This film is admirable in its attempt...The acting was decent, and the special effects were decent, the cinematography was decent. But this film did nothing new or interesting and quite frankly, it was a little melodramatic and contrived at the end.In all honesty, the cursory nature of the entire production shows through a little too much."
2,Bit off more than they can chew,"This movie needed a larger budget to achieve what they wanted. In no instance did I ever feel that the main commander was in danger. The silly smoke squibs the POOR sound effects, it just seemed like a group of men running around in a field. This movie was difficult to get through."
2,some good things here but over all needed more direction,"concept was good. acting was too weak for the length of screentime they received. It could have worked if cuts were moved off of them faster. Was the old lady in some way connected--was she rescued..? Dialogue was also weak. The woman was walking along the wall at first--that was beautiful but that made me think that it was going to be her story--her history. Who the man at the memorial was there to honor was not clearly established--that was confusing. If he was looking for the pictures of his journalist grandfather to begin with then we could have connected to the jouranlist when we saw him. Who the ""hero"" was was not clear--I get that it was about them both but it is too short for us to have them both be the ""main guy."" Director needs to establish a better sense of where they are going. The story made me want to know more about the battle. Could have been better but was a good start. Battle scenes were the best."
3,Well made but not convincing...,"You can tell that the filmmaker put alot of effort into making the viewer feel like he/she is right there taking fire on the mountain like the soldiers. I sympathize with the storyline but there were some things that didn't make sense to me. For example, I don't believe the woman in the beginning is Italian - she switches back and forth between an overkill Italian accent and what is clearly American English and that distracted me. And why are those nice Italians having a PICNIC in the middle of a war zone? Finally, I don't believe that a reporter would stick around in the middle of sniper fire just to DRAW a picture of the battle scene. Overall though, a good effort."
5,Film with Bite and Surprise,"The story here is a timeless one and the subtle effects like lend strongly to the authenticity and intensity of the story. The characters are extremely well developed for such a short film and their plight is arresting to the viewer. The conclusion is solid with characters being drawn together in the larger story--one that reveals a bond of humanity in the face of dspair. To say, as one reviewer put it, that the plot is cliche' not only denegrates the subject matter but ignores the obvious skill of some high caliber writers and producers who have skillfully shown their ability to bring a touching human element to the larger struggle in which the characters are involved. This film is going places. Stuff like this would get me in a theater more often."
5,Exceeds expectations-10 stars!!!!,Depicts world of combat in under 10 minutes. Very informative and inspiring. I hope all agrees this one is the winner!
5,realistic,"I just finished reviewing this film and I thought it was a great.I really loved how realistic this film was. It is very heartfelt every time I see soldiers carrying children and helping outwomen. It really touches my heart. I really hurt for the familieswho lose loved ones in war. It is very sad to know we have soldiers dying everyday fighting for our country. I wish that there is something I could do to help them. Best of Luck to theseguys who made this film.Joni SearcyPickens, SC"
1,I am just curious...,"I am just curious why the soldier doesn't remove his hand from his helmet...I am just curious how the bomb disintegrates both soldiers, but keeps the paper intact...I am just curious why those people decided to picnic in the middle of a war zone...I am just curious why the guns sound like cap guns...I am just curious why there are some people who actually like this movie...But I guess you have to support your family or friends--even if they produce a garbage film like this one!Let me suggest a few films and filmmakers for the director to watch--maybe he can learn a thing or two....Kubrick--esp. Full Metal Jacket--if you decide on another war film.Scorsese--Any one of his films...FordHawksHitchcockWellesAlso...watch Platoon, Patton, and Apocalypse NowThese are just a few suggestions--it might help, big guy!"
3,An average made film,"This war movie could have been better if they paid more attention to the details true to the WWII era. The sound effects were awful and did NOT feel true to this movie. They were repetitive and annoying. The directing was ok and the vehicles were a plus, but I feel like there was little point to the story. Was the point that this captain saved the little girl? I'm not sure what the moral was here. Overall the directing was good but there were so many other elements that were missing that I can only call this short film average."
3,Battaglia,It looks like any other war movie. I would watch it if it was on tv but I would'nt go to the movies and pay to watch it or rent it.
1,Huh?!,"So silly! What are women and children doing on the battlefield?? Not to mention the photographer.. his camera "" broke"" so he decided to just draw pictures???? what war was this?? Ha! Couldnt watch the ending... you shouldnt either!"
1,needs more,I like war movies as much as the next man - but this was not really a war movie. just some bad acting and bad specials effects and a bunch of grown men in paintball gear playing pretend.
1,"Yup, War is Heck","The nicest thing I can say about this film is that the production value is high. Otherwise, it's dull and super corny."
1,Best of show...if the show was about the poorest attempts at a war film.,"This film was just terrible. Not only was the acting poor, but I am convinced that they are only in the top five because they've stressed the patriotism of the film so much, that people who are voting think ""if I don't vote for this film, the terrorists have won."" i wish i could give zero stars..."
3,What battle?,"After viewing the flick I did a web search for this ""Battle of Battalia"" Only found vague references to the Trojans in another era and such. I was disappointed with this aspect of the film; otherwise it was ok."
5,"Awesome, awesome, awesome!","This short film is truly amazing! Heartfelt, exciting, thrilling . . . wow! Very impressive concept with stunning production value. A job well done!"
2,So what,"I can understand what the movie is trying to do or say, but it doesn't fit in a short film. The reason war movies are long is because it takes that long to say something interesting or new. The film making was impressive, but I found myself saying ""I know."" Good work, but save up money until you can give it what it needs."
2,Boyish war film,I am so tired of all these boyish war films. They have nothing to say except revoke some sentimenatalism. Observe your own environment instead of making superficial fantacy.
3,Not Bad,This is the second movie I watched on this competition. It wasn't bad but I think it needed better sound effects for a war movie. but overall pretty good.
3,"good camera work, but left me wanting on story","story is paramount and even with ""war stories"" there is still a central character, theme, that is universal in and out of the settings...and in this one, i couldn't sense the central story, the desires wants and needs of the central character, or who was the central character outside of the synopsis....but the shooting was spot on, the music/effects/acting were all great...the rating i gave is based purely on the story (and story is always subjective)....outside of that, you did well"
2,Time and film are precious commodities,"Given the title of this review, it should come as no surprise that I didn't finish watching the short. Ripping a ""style"" without character development is a hollow excercise in my book.As a filmmaker, I demand a story. Style is superflouos.That said, there is talent a-plenty on board - I'd like to see it maximized."
2,keep trying,"for a film of this nature, a higher budget is first needed for some better sound a visual effects. the ones in this short were pretty sad i must say. the actors were pretty unrealistic. i personally love war movies, but this one tries to achieve a heart felt moment for an event in time that just seems simply cheesy (for lack of a better word)."
1,Sabotage!!!,"for shame. I've been watching this competition for a fews days now and I've just noticed that any 5 star reviewer that comes in for you movie, just happens to leave 1 stars for everybody else. Why the obvious Sabotage. Can't you at least try and hide the cheating? I'm leaving 5 stars for everybody else but Battaglia. By the way... WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT HUGE GIANT 5 STAR REVIEW I SAW A FEWS DAYS AGO FROM YOUR DIRECTOR? HE WAS RANTING AND RANTING ABOUT EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY. WHO REMOVED IT???"
2,Nice try,"I thought there were some good shots but the story has been done 1,000 times before. Definitely the most budget of the shorts, should have spent more on the script."
2,"Tries hard, but sappy and slow paced","I feel bad rating this one poorly, because it's so darn earnest. But it's sappy, not very tight, and was obviously cut down from a longer film: otherwise how to explain why it's exactly 6:59 in a contest that allows films only up to 7:00?I guess a bunch of people will like this one, but truly I thought the only film that actually managed to keep my interest was the shortest: Coming Home."
1,BREAKING NEWS! - DIRECTOR BEGS AND CRYS FOR GOOD VOTES,"This quote comes directly from the director:""So, even if you have already voted in the previous stages of the contest, Jeff, Owen, their crew, and cast need you to get back to the Amazon/Tribeca Screening Room and vote again!""(Yes cheat you way to victory - The director then Continues to CRY...)Place your highest vote for ""Battaglia"" and also take a couple of extra minutes to write a positive review for the film.(Aparenly even if you DIDN'T like BATTAGLIA - the 'director' commands that you DO like it and you WILL vote highly for it. So HURRY UP and don't piss of the Director... He might beg some more... and nobody want to hear that)"
1,Dribble,Battaglia suffers from Hollywood-itis. Defined as a repackaged tired formula concept film that can not rise above the level of it's maker.
5,Jay's review,This is a heart-felt film that shows the timelessness of family and karma. It was excellent! I truly enjoyed this film. The production values were of high calibre and the acting was honest. Truly a professional film.
4,"finally, an Amazon Short that held my interest!","Sure, the sound effects aren't up to ""Saving Private Ryan"", but the framing story around the center war story is actually more compelling."
5,Thanks!,A friend of mine told me once that we have a tendancy to remember what we shouldn't and to forget the things that we should remember. Thanks for helping us to remember the cost of Freedom! Well done.
5,A Quilting Must Have,This book is filled with many traditional quilt patterns. Detailed instructions are included for each pattern. A great addition for any quilters library.
2,A must for any quilter!,This is my second time to purchase this terrific reference book. I have loaned it out so many times that I can remember where my original copy is!! The rotary cutting directions are clear and accurate.
4,A beginner's view,"Having recently started patchwork and quilting this book was recommended by my tutor. I have found it to be helpful particularly in choosing blocks that are for all abilities and also the diagrams for piecing order, cutting techniques and planning a quilt."
4,Lifetime warranty,"Love the colors,bakes great,lifetime warranty.Lose's a star because even after soaking they are hard to clean in the crevice's.I was under the impression that you do not have to grease silicone but you do,I used coconut oil,next time i will use cooking spray and see if it solves the cleaning problem.These cups are thick and the muffins did come out easy without having to turn them inside out.I did soak them inside out.Most of the other ones i looked at are only good for 1000 bakings,these are good for life."
5,Great way to study Japanese!,"This is an awesome software! You have to be an expert at Japanese. The pictures are so bright and colorful! This software will help you and improve your listening, reading, writing, and speaking skills. I really love this software!Gambatte kudasai!"
1,"DON,T TRUST COSTUME CRAZY..",I AM REALLY DISSAPOIND FROM THIS PRODUCT BUT ALSO FROM COSTUME CRAZY..I TRY TO CONTACT THEM AND THEY WAS NOT HELPFULL AT ALL...REALLY BAD...
5,Perfect Collar,"There's not a lot you can say about a collar except you can't go wrong with this one. I really like the martingale style because it never slips off when you need it most. I have a large powerful breed so I don't like plastic snaps, which this collar does not have. Very functional...good fit. Great choice."
3,the release feature did not work well,"My little long-haired chihauhau's fur kept keeping the release feature from allowing the collar to loosen up when he would stop pulling away from me. I was constantly loosening it up manually. But otherwise, if he had not had long fur, I think this would have worked very well."
3,Not good for Shelties,"No matter how I size it, my Shetland Sheepdog can back right out of it. (Their heads are smaller than their necks and this collar does not tighten enough to stay put.) I'm going back to a slip collar as soon as Amazon can ship one to me."
4,It works but only used once so far.,My Rottie likes to sniff everything and I dont like using a choke chain. A regular collar was a joke and he hates his gentle leader so i thought I'd try this. I was surprised when i received the product as I received 2 for the price of one! I tried it today and it seemed to work well. The only problem is that the part that tightens when he pulls seems to be too long. Id like to tighten the collar a bit more but then I wouldnt be able to get it over his block head. So far so good. If any negatives Ill come back and change the rating.
5,"red premier pet collar, so good as we hoped it would be","it came fast and in a good condition and our dog and we like it, and other dog-owners already admired it. wonderful"
5,Martingale Dog Collar,This collar was just what I was looking for. I followed the advice of others and ordered a size smaller because they run big and it fit exactly. My dog can not pull out of this collar which I like. Great for wearing around the house and for going for walks. I actually use this collar when I work on his obedience training and he likes it much better than the prong collar. It was a much better price than the one I bought at the pet store and the quality was also better.
5,Perfect,"We have used traditional choke collars for our goldens for a long time. Because we were switching to a retractable leash (the Freedom Leash for 2 dogs - also an excellent product), I was worried about too much tension on the collar. In addition, the old chain collars hung and banged into their front legs.This collar stays loose until you really need it and provides exactly the amount of correction when necessary. Works great with a retractable leash, looks good and is very easy to slip on and off. The dogs took to it right away."
3,Premier Pet Collar Med Red,Collar is a nice color and seems sturdy. Was easy to adjust with instructions as provided. I took away a star because there is some sharp stitching on the collar which seems like a flaw. Otherwise a good purchase. Size was right for my 47 lb. mixed breed dog.
5,No more Houdini!!!,"This is an awesome collar! We have a half blue tick coon hound, half black mouth yellow cur... all hunting dog. The dog has escaped EVERY collar we have ever owned, except this one. We've gone through the typical choke chain type collars, harnesses, and a wide variety of other collars.. all of which the dog backed out of. We have had this collar for three weeks and she has not gotten out of it yet. Normally it takes a few days for her to figure out how to get out of a new collar but not this one. Check the measurement of your dog carefully. This collar measures from behind the ears at the top of the neck, not at the base of the neck. We missed this but the collar we bought still fits well and works great."
4,Really is no slip,"Very good collar, adjustment remains where you set it, has choke feature to prevent slipping. Only complaint is it's hard to remove after a walk, since you have to smush the dog's ears as you pull it off their neck since it has no buckle. It can serve as a main collar, but we like to remove it since our other dog likes to play by tugging on the neck/collar of the other dog. Would recommend, but if you're down at the bottom near the 10"" mark you may want to get the next smaller size."
5,Problem Solved,"No doubt most people who buy this product plan to use it for training. It should work very well in that capacity since it certainly does get the dog's attention. It is also much kinder to the dog than those chain-type collars that are often used but should still get the same results.My problem was a dog weighing over 100 lbs and her sometime refusal to go into her pen at night. Her trick was to just lie down and not move. When she tries that now I just slip this collar over her head along with a leash and away we go, usually with just a small amount of pressure. Once she is in the pen I remove the collar; it is probably best that it not be left on except when actually being used for training or discipline."
3,Works okay but a bit narrow,"I had purchased two of these at once for my dogs. They work fine but one of my dogs is paticulary strong so I would like to spread the force when he resists so it wont dig into his throat. So far, they stay on though. I would not use this collar to tie a dog up though as it tightens but for everyday use and a means of identification its great I bought this dog collar because my dogs keep getting out of the old collars with both buckles and snaps and I was tired of replacing their collars and tags when they got lost."
5,Great collar!,"These have always been collars of choice for my dogs. Schnauzers, beagles, greyhounds and labs.... They all responded very well to the collar. It doesn't slip off only if you fit the dog properly to the collar and purchase the correct size. It's nice to have more control over my dogs and teach them to be more leash friendly without much effort."
1,Waste of money,"The collar was used once. My dog slipped out of it on first outing. I ordered based on the posted measurement, but it was apparently too big. We went back to a harness."
2,Didn't work for us,"We rescued a wild, extremely curious, and hyper pitbull puppy. Walking her has done a number on my husband and I's shoulders. We were using a choke chain to walk her (she outgrew it), which was also trying, but it held her back better than this collar. She is a serious puller, so this collar is pretty ineffective for our situation. We are constantly adjusting it further up on her neck, but with her pulling, it always manages to move back to the furthest part of her neck. We'll give a pinch collar a try next..."
4,Wonderful,"Great price, works well. Take it off if you are washing your dog. This stretches when wet and doggie got his teeth around it and chewed it up! But Martingale collars are awesome for training and allowed in the competition ring!"
2,Webbing too think,"Ordered for small (13 lb.) dog for obedience class. Considering the size required for her small neck, the webbing is just too thick. It should be about 3/8"" or narrower. I also had to take the collar apart and re-sew it in order to get it small enough. Adjusting the collar for tight, high on neck use and then trying to loosen it to remove it is unhandy. Would do better with a snap closure."
5,Dog collar,"This is a great collar. I would highly recommend it. We have two dogs, a toy poodle 5 pounds and a miniature poodle 15 pounds. It's perfect for the miniature but way too big for the toy. It's a collar I would buy over other collars because of it's quality."
3,It's not what you really need,"The pronuncation is not Netherlands' Dutch. It sounds much more Vlaams, the Dutch dialect spoken in North of Belgium. It's not much a difference, but Dutch people from Amsterdam wouldn't always catch what you say.Second, I don't think it's effective way to learn the language. Basically it's just sentences on the screen with pictures, you read, you hear and you try to remember. It doesn't require you to have any language as a basis. However, I would prefer more explanations of grammar which make clear how language works, and more live dialogs from which you can learn how to interact with people, rather than dumb phrases like 'The boy is going to jump' with appropriate picture."
3,"Based on fact, but not factual","It's ok, but not really thr way it happeded. A good story, but that's all. If you're looking for history, don't look here."
4,Lots of Room for your iPad,"Good:-Lots of room for your iPad-Right sized profile--not too big-Genuine leatherBad:-Not rigid enough--comprised of soft leather, it's a bit floppy-The leather ties on the zippers are too much flair for my tastes--I took them off and it looks better-I paid $90 with the Amazon Visa discount. It is not worth the full price--even with the discount at $90, the price seems a bit high for what you get."

5,A True Marine,"To have read the book and met the man it all seems to fit. A true original, inspires all those that have a dream, have ever felt things were to tough, luckyenough takes care of all that. We should all be so lucky to have something and someone to love as much as Ed cares for his passions. Enjoy the book!"
4,Very good,Magenta caught my ear the first time on internet radio. Very Renassiance sounding with a big dose of Genesis and Yes. I was hoping they would not steal too much from Genesis and Yes but after i listened to the cd it was obvious.I would still recomend to all fans of the genre but don't get to upset if you think they are ripping-off other bands from the past.
3,a good read,"This book by Ferre is an easy read but some work is laid out for you if you want to strengthen your spiritual life. It is easily readable as Ferre normally writes so that lay persons can read and understand. I found it helpful and interesting.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,Hilarious,"This is a hilarious musical comedy which you either like or hate. I liked it very much. The songs are good, the comedy includes everything from great to groaners. The performances are uniformally excellent. Rue McClanahan is great as the Mother Superior and shows how good a comedienne she was and how she'll be missed. But the real scene stealer is the Semina De Laurentis as Sister Marionette. I've seen revivals of the show and no one has come close to this hilarious performance. Also great is Christine Anderson and Terry White (who I just saw in the revival of Follies). This isn't new but the picture and sound are very good. Originally shown on A&E when it actually showed Arts and Entertainment--a long time ago. Have a good time."
5,The best!,Nunsense is absolutely adorable...... so funny and with Rue McClanahan it just set up to be hilarious! A must see and one you will laugh at.
2,Perhaps it's me?,"Well, I read the description and the fantastic reviews, I'm a big fan of Rue McClanahan and so I bought the DVD. Oh dear!On the positive side, Rue McClanahan has two hysterically funny scenes and the cast as a whole works very hard. But.........Perhaps it's me, but I just didn't find it that funny (except for the two scenes mentioned above), I thought the sound was dreadful, particularly the echo on one nun's mike during the last 20 minutes or so, the camera work was unexceptional and how old was that audience! Perhaps that it. Maybe the show appeals to a more mature audience. Or something."
1,nunsence is boring,"Dreary,dreary, dreary. It looks like an amateur production filmed ina village hall. Rue McClanahan is using her Golden Girls popularity to make up for her total lack of musical comedy skills. There are some seriously questionable performances , lots of 'mugging'. Ugh, its just awful."
3,christmas with montovani,the cd did not sound like Montovani at all. I have many works of montovani but I am disapointed with this one.Christmas With the Mantovani Orchestra
1,The book is out of date,The book had a lot of useful info....however it is really out of date. Things have defenitaly changed in the Lake Tahoe area.I wish I had known....perhaps I would not have bought the book!!!!
3,Better off surfing the net,"While I have nothing against this book, it is out of date and kind of weird seeing it for sale. I know it's out of date because I bought the website from the author over a year ago... because the book was out of date. Anyway, if you'd like a lot of info about Tahoe and getting married there, the book's old website was tahoeweddings.com. Check it out."
1,Disappointing,I was very disappointed. It provided little if not any help in planning my wedding. One would be much better off just surfing the internet -- where I have found much more useful information. ....
5,Excellent Guide for Experienced and Beginning Writers,"Chris Roerden has written an excellent, readable book. The subtitle is 24 Fiction-Writing Techniques To Save Your Manuscript from Turning Up...D.O.A. But she offers a lot more than that. There are tons of great tips that will make everyone a better writer. She uses humor and great examples to illustrate her points.This is the book I'd give to any budding novelist--not just mystery writers. She is an editor and avid reader who uses her experience to help experienced and amateur writers fine tune their manuscripts. I learned a lot."
5,Great advice book,"I am looking at becoming an author and this book had some tremendous tips in it. Writing a book looks so easy fromteh outside but once you are in the process there are all sorts of little minefields that can slow you down or derail your project completely; this book is very helpfl in not inly help you look for and find the minefields, it also helps you work around them.I would recommend this book to any aspiring mystery author!"
4,CURSE OF THE GREEN EYES IS AN UNDERRATED GEM,"This neat little vampire flick---known in Europe as CURSE OF THE GREEN EYES---is one of those rare films that although made on a small budget, manages to catch lightning in bottle. As is often the case, those involved probably didn't even realize what was so special about the film they'd made.The film is a fine example of the sexy and imaginative horror movies made in Europe during the 1960s. It features interesting turns on the genre, spooky cinematography and production design, and an unmistakably 1960s musical score.The DVD---which is Region 1---has good sound and a good, clear picture. A fine addition for any Vampire/Eurohorror collector, and at a bargain price. You'll never feel the same way during a nighttime power outage after seeing this."
3,Stay away from the grotto,"Odd film concerned with the mysterious deaths of local villagers. An inspector is sent to the small town to solve the mystery, where he encounters a collection of unusual characters. Before a murder occurs the electricity in town fails and vampire marks are discovered on the victim's necks. In addition, the bodies are also vanishing after the funeral. Upon talking to the locals the inspector discovers that a professor and two assistants have moved into an abandoned castle six months earlier, conducting research on blood. The villagers express fears regarding vampires inhabiting the grotto adjacent to the castle. The movie relies more on plot, with some excellent photography and creepy night sounds as opposed to thrills. Fans of modern horror films may want to stay away from this one. DVD is a quality transfer of the film."
4,Great Fights except.....,I just reciently purchased this video it is for most of the part a great video. One of my favorite fights was the Burnett fight he is a great fighter. There are alot of great fights except the pat miletich fights i really for the most part hate his fights but reciently his has been alright. The suprising main event was great even though it was very short. This video is well wourth the money.
5,full force,full force the original hip hop band i got to give this c.d. 5stars each song on the c.d. was off the hinges my favrite song on the c.d. in like with you and aint my type of hype alot of peaple slept on this c.d. but if your a true hip hop fan like i am then buy it 1 love xchild
3,Ping pong?,"I understand the director's vision to glorify ping-pong, but I just can't take this short serious enough to rank it really high. The filming was amazing, absolutely fantastic with a really short budget. However, the script was not up to par. I was confused in a few places and didn't feel the suspense or the comedy (if that was intended). I was just awed by the filming."
3,Table tennis anyone?,"This movie reminded me of ""Dodgeball"" in its quirkyness and sillyness. It was funny and who knew table tennis could be so intense or so dangerous? While other people decide to fight battles with guns or nuclear weapons, death decides to play a little game of table tennis. The music does indeed add to the suspense and the drama. It's a scene that's all too familiar and looks to be straight out of ""The Sims 2"" where you get to duel with death for your soul. The little girl is incredibly cute! Death could've looked a little more emaciated or paler. It's a good movie that fits into the present day comedy genre."
1,Is it supposed to be scary or funny,"This story is all over the place. Do not know if its the story or the acting, but just was not understanding what they were trying to get across. The devil made me laugh with his acting and so did the ping pong guy. Don't know why this movie is in the finals!"
2,Dissapointing,"The concept is very good. The execution is rather juvenile. The film is done like a typical college project. The acting is overdone to an extreme, and, as a result it crushes the humor. Production values are high: camera, lighting, sound deserve applause."
1,How did this make it here,I thought the whole idea was to create something that could end up feature length... I could hardly get thru the seven minutes.
3,duel at the red table,"film was more comedy than horror,nice insight on how sports play a part in our lives and minds."
1,I have to agree!,"I didnt watch this but once and caught the Heineken right off. I thought they were sponsors, but I guess not."
5,I'm playing the wrong sport.,If that's ping pong then I need to get me some of that. Football looks safe now.
1,This looks like one of those movies....,"that used to sit on the side shelf at my grandparents video store that never rented. We would try to stick them in with the new releases and they still were pushed to the side. Couldn't tell if these guys were trying to be scary or funny... I think I laughed more, so probably funny....Sad... very sad that it made it this far..."
3,Cute Redo of the Twilight Zone Genre,I enjoy the play on words in the title and the over the top parody of the genre. There were some clever moments and camera shots.
2,Not getting it.,"I am not a filmographer. I am purely a viewer. I did not enjoy this film. Functional creativity and heart were missing. I judge these films by asking myself, ""Would I recommend this to my family/peers."" The answer would be no for this film."
5,This should win...,"This was very well done. The director totally understands timeing. Editing is very tricky but this guy seems like a naturl.If anybody knows anything about film making they know that a film is made in the editing room. This guy will make it big one day. Great job, really funny stuff."
2,I want my time back,"The low rating is for the storyline (film quality is why it got a 2). I thought this was a horrible story - cliched, predictable, uncreative...almost enough to the point of being annoying. It's mind-boggling that when given the opportunity to do anything via film, this is all that someone could muster up?... and that it's scoring well?!. I'm guessing friends are writing reviews, because I spent hours watching the shorts that were submitted and truly feel this is one of the worst. My sister, when 10-years old, made a more compelling and creative movie with her re-enactment of the Attack of the Killer Tomatos. For that matter, i think my time was better well spent watching my 80-year old uncle's home video of his cruise to Alaska. This movie being a finalist is just a shame."
1,Boring! Boring! Boring!,I had to force myself through this movie just so I could write the review to warn people not to waste their time as well! This movie sucked!
2,Original...maybe,"This entry was intriguing at first and seemed like a new idea, but it was just ""Crossroads"" or ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia"" in a different setting."
1,great director;terrible script,"I think this director really knows how to use the camera and direct talent...but the story is just ridiculous, and I think everyone knew it but went ahead for a good laugh.It didn't make me laugh at all."
5,"Better than ""Misfortune Cookie""","This movie outdoes ""Misfortune Cookie"" by a longshot. Congrats to Paccione for having a second film make the top five.I really did enjoy this film. The idea was original, but the concept wasn't anything new (good vs. evil, good guy saves the day). ""Duel at Red Table"" wasn't about the story though; it's about the visuals and style, which were top notch. The best element had to be the simply amazing editing.Two of the top five were absolute garbage. The other three were very well-done and enjoyable. I'd say Paccione might win this time.Paccione, if you're reading this, I hope you win the $50 grand. Your direction really stands out. Whether or not you win, please make another film next festival. (I may even enter a short, who knows.)"
3,My Uncle died in a knife fight after a ping pong match!,"While I didn't really find this all that funny, I did like it for some ungodly reason. I guess the bad guy taking peoples souls is the Devil, and anything where the Devil plays ping pong I'm down for. It also kinda felt like a cartoon, the camera angles and the way it was shot kinda had a Japanese Anime feel to it, or maybe its just me... Anyway, good little flick, not great, but good."
2,The reason,"There's a reason why that genre amalgamation has never focused on ping pong, and that reason is this film.Decent cinematography, though."
5,Cool movie,"Really liked this, but I've been competing in table tennis tournaments since I was 12, so I might be a little biased. The guy playing the devil dude was awesome, totally over the top in a good way! Good luck!"
1,Are you kidding me?,What a compete waste of time who made this film is this there bestwhat a joke--This is no battaglia!
1,Just plain awful,"<sigh>. Ok, like the others it tries hard, but c'mon. Poor plotting, terrible pacing, a very tired Charlie Daniels Band ""Devil Went Down to Georgia"" rehash. About as not-fresh as can be. Maybe taking a few minutes off the editing would have helped (granted, I've got the same comment about all of these films except Coming Home, which is under 2 mins).And confused! What's with the little girl going off with the guy into the forest? I guess there WAS a twist--I was definitely not expecting to see a grown man walk off into a forest with a little girl that wasn't his daughter."
4,Ancient Chinese Secret?,"This film really grew on me. I didn't know if I would like it at all at first but I let it ride and was pleasantly suprised. It had some okay (over the top style) acting which I didn't mind and the story was pretty palatable. One thing I noticed right away was the resemblence to a japanese action film called VERSUS. It was like a corny, funny, kind of spoof of the low budget japanese action film. Good flick and I wish the other stories had been as unique in a good way."
2,Fun with effects,"Started really slowly. Overused theme. No real emphasis on acting, just a makeup kit and some video effects - wait - that could make it in Hollywood!"
1,SABOTAGE!!!,"for shame. I've been watching this competition for a fews days now and I've just noticed that any 5 star reviewer that comes in for you movie, just happens to leave 1 stars for everybody else. Why the obvious Sabotage. Can't you at least try and hide the cheating? I'm leaving 5 stars for everybody else but Red Table. By the way... IS THIS WHY YOU CAME IN ""SECOND PLACE"" IN THE FIRST COMPETITION??"
2,very strange,This is an odd movie about a ping pong player. It is not very well acted and the photography leaves alot to be desired as it jumps around and doesn't always focus well on the actor/scene. I find the script to be poorly written.
3,At least it's an attempt,"I has some decent, although cheesy, premise. It might not be the most original thing out there, but it takes a spin on the much traveled path of soul collecting spirits/monsters/devils, which shows a tendency to look for new things to work with. I also feel that the ""Mr. K..."" line was forcing a simlarity with the popular ""Mr. Anderson"" that Agent Smith used in Matrix."
1,Ding Dong not Ping Pong,Any film that is only 7 minutes long and has a flash-back sequence clocking in at around 3 minutes into the film is destined to disappoint.The pacing is off the action is repetative and the film is humorless. A study in contrast on how to do it right can be found in De Duva (The Dove 1968) by Coe/Lover.
5,Creative!,"I really loved this movie! The little girl was so cute, and ping pong as an action movie--how creative can you get? Good luck!"
1,This film gave me Ping Pong elbow,"I understand the choice of ping pong as something so odd that it is the joke itself, however, at some point the film maker seems to be taking the fight with evil a bit too seriously. This is a ping pong movie after all. If you are going to start out with an ironic look at the ""seriousness"" of ping pong, stay with that less than serious feeling throughout the film."
2,Not for me,"I didn't like this movie. The idea is unique, but I just couldn't connect with the movie. I found myself halfway into the movie still wondering why this precious little girl was inside a rowdy saloon and then allowed to follow a strang man through the woods. I'm glad the cute little thing ended up okay in the end, but it just seems like a weird way to contrive what I think was the message of the movie."
2,Editing/Acting/Casting,"The two stars are for the earnest attempt. But what gives with the editing? I don't care if one of the 4 or five genres this movie claims are comedy or farce or not, I Can't get over the editing, especally of the pingpong scenes. I watched this three times in a row and was never able to gett past the horrible acting in regard to the ping pong play itself. It's obvious these two guys have no clue how to play, but shouldn't at least basic skills have been a prerequesite before the filmaker cast them? It doesn't look like his was shot on film so couldn't the director roll long enough to get better footage than this? Did nobody involved understand at least the basics of pingpong? Know your subject matter."
5,Great Movie,What a funny movie! I thought this was by far the best of all the films good work to all that worked on this!
3,Great shortmovie!,I liked the part of the forest and sound affects. -Esther Kim Leonia Middle School-
3,It was ok,the movie was to short but the beging was boring but i still liked it. a reader/wacher flo a
2,Cute,"I knew this guy back in college. He's the guy (writer, director, whatever) who has cool ideas, has the motivation to produce them, and does so with impressive skill and humor. But that's about it. What was the point of the short? Besides weird camera effects, it was just him and his buddies making a movie. I've made funny stuff too for my Telenovela in Spanish class, but I don't think it warrants an award."
4,Strange...but funny,"This was a little loopy, but I think that's what I liked about it. Good for a Friday afternoon, end of work, start to weekend. I did notice the review that said these filmmakers were leaving all great reviews for themselves, and bad reviews for everyone else, so I just checked like the last 20 reviews (you can click on ""see all reviews"" for each reviewer) and that's not the case. If anything, it's the opposite. If anyone cares (bored at work like me) you can see for yourself. Whatever. Like anyone reads these things anyway."
5,My teacher wrote this,I thought this was a very funny short film. My awesome teacher wrote this. I think it was sooooooooo funny. I hope this wins!Update:Hey you know what? This movie won! Take that other movies!Yeah Mr.White! Yeah Jack! We got to meet Jack. He's awesome! So is my teacher!
5,Such a creative film,"I loved this short film.It was a bundle of different emotions. Funny , Scary, and not your everyday ordinary plot. It has a good old happy ending when good wins over evil. The special effects are awsome. Nice Job Jack.You deserve to win!!!!"
4,Entertaining,"An interesting idea and some great camera work, but a little hard to make sense of all the supernatural stuff going on during the duel scene. Being a competitive table tennis player, I'd also have to comment that the match choreography was a bit ridiculous, but that's forgivable considering hardly anyone in America has actually seen this sport played at a competitive level."
3,Unnecessary,"Im a massive fan of Pink Floyd and a massive fan of chill out. Chill out would be my topic on Mastermind, it really would. This album doesnt really do either Floyd or chill out justice. Most Pink Floyd is already chilled out, and this album, if anything, made it coarser and less mellow than it was. Not bad for a listen though."
3,Good chill-out remixes,"This album is probably not going to please the Pink Floyd 'purists'. It is a remix/cover album by artists interpreting Pink Floyd in a new style. 'Interpreting' is the key word here. If you're into good house/chill music in a good up-market bar, and a Pink Floyd fan, you'll appreciate this. If you don't like house/chill music, you'll probably hate this album (just see the reviews below). Its a modern, interesting version of some great songs (too bad its not multi-channel SACD!)."
2,Funny blasphemy,"Just listened to the samples, and they ARE fun!!!!!!! I don't think I would spend more than $1 for it, but I would have a good lough listening."
1,HORRIBLE STUFF,"An altogether pile of trash swept up by people who have no talent, and no songs of their own. Someone should tell them to leave Pink Floyd alone(I would rate this 0 stars if it were a rating)."
1,'chill out tribute',These people are so going to hell for doing this to pink floyd songs. Do not buy this if you like pink floyd the way pink floyd sounds.
1,one star is already too much,"DISRESPECT. thats all i have to say, we should establish a censorship committee to purge these pain inflicting items from the same search results of pink floyd albums..."
2,Basic College Mathematics,I was terribly disappointed as the text received is the instructors edition with all answers noted within the text. As a student of course this text was not what I thought I was purchasing. It was too late to return the text as the semester was in session at the time the text was purchased. I will definitely not use this service again as there will questions as to what I will receive and there is no time for returning and reordering text. Thanx for asking
5,The best Basic College Mathematics book,The book is really easy to read and follow directions.I like the exercise reviews after each class and the test at the end of each chapter it is very helpful.I really recomend this book.
4,Almost Satisfied,"The book is very helpful but needs to cover more ground. It should also be reorganized so that all answers are in the back of the book. A person needs more encouragement and feel that he/she is on the right track before going to check it out. Other than that, this is a wise buy for someone who wants to brush up on their math skills or students."
5,Why Did I Not Hear About This Album Until Now??,"This is an incredible and world class thrash album. I gave it a 5/5 (in my opinion) and I don't give a 5/5 to very many albums. I'm constantly looking for that next great metal album to listen to and time and time again I'm disappointed. Well with this album I've finally found that great album in Violent Revolution. Great riffs and well written catchy metal songs. This came out in 2001 and can't believe I'm just discovering it now. I can't believe Kreator has been off my radar since I was in high school when Coma of Souls came out. In discovering this album I went back and looked at all of the Kreator albums from Endless Pain to the 2012 release of Phantom Antichrist and their now one of my favorite bands of all time. If you like heavy metal and your tired of all the crap music (with the exception of a few) that's come out over the last few years, give this a listen. AWESOME ALBUM!!!"
4,Lets start a Ghetto War!,Ghetto war and Violent revolution are among the best Kreator songs ever. Very decent album but I still prefer classics like Coma of Souls and Pleasure to Kill.
2,Good protection but eventually breaks,"I have an older version of this case than the one here I believe and it did a good job as the phone still looks new but 2 of the 6 clips that hold the top and bottom pieces together have broken off and now there is a break in the top plate just to the right of the ""end call"" button.I wasn't overly rough on the phone although I do just leave it in my pocket so I'm very disappointed in the durability. The case also collects dust pretty easily so you have to open it up and clean it out frequently if you like your phone looking new and shiny.Overall a good, simple clear case that will protect your Pearl (although not the screen, you need some screen covers for that) but durability is pretty suspect so I'm going to try the carbon fiber case this time around."
3,Pleased,"Its a great case, I drop my phone alot and it protects it, also Im a painter, so my phone isn't all messy when i put it in my other case"
3,"Works, but...","Considering I only paid $3.97 including shipping, this case is excellent. It fits well, the clip is secure and the openings are lined up correctly. The down side is that the snaps that hold the case halves together are raised from the sides, making them rather sharp. I scratched my hand and arm on them several times, and I wouldn't want to use this case wearing an expensive wool suit or the likes, for fears it would snag. Overall, it's a reliable, secure case, worth the amount you pay for it. If you're looking for something nicer, spend the extra money."
2,not very clear,"Since there is absolutely no English on this software at all, as I moved farther along in the lessons it got harder and harder to figure out what the korean word meant. Without consulting my son's korean friend I think I would have been lost. Perhaps on the full CD you get a better feel, or perhaps I am just too ""eurocentric"" because I had no trouble learning French in a full emersion environment. I think an English translation guide would be helpful. I did like the quiz format however."
2,Basics are missing,The format of this program is that the learner selects right answer from four photos depicting the written sentences or what they hear. It places heavy focus on reading. Therefore it is not appropriate for beginners who don't have prior training in Korean.
2,Not for complete beginners or intermediates,"I was not very impressed with this program at all. I am a Korean linguist and I was hoping this would help to expand my knowledge, however, it is way too simple for someone with any prior formal language training. On the other hand, I noticed that it does not even teach the alphabet, a vital key to learning any language. The only reason it got two stars was because if someone could obtain training on the Korena alphabet, then this could be an excellent tool for beginners."
4,"Great , but not a classic","I didn't want to put this book down. Great story, characters, flowing writing style.DnD books can be a bit hit or miss. This was a hit! Even if your not a DnD fan or into the realms, its still good enough to read. And if your into the realms its full of lore about shar and selune.I may not reread it. But I throughly enjoyed reading it. And it was well worth the money."
4,Tony Bennett,This CD is a pleasurable assortlment of his hits.I play it when I work on my hobbies.It is a good assortment of his type music.
5,A Delightful Bennett Collection,"""The Ultimate Tony Bennett"" pays great tribute to a lengthy career that has not been diminished by age or time. Tony Bennett has outlived most of his contemporaries, and has remained contemporary in the eyes and ears of music fans, despite all of the challenges faced by a musician of his genre.Of course, ""I Left My Heart In San Francisco"" is featured. No Bennett compilation would be complete without it. The collection also includes ""Rags To Riches,"" ""If I Ruled The World,"" ""The Boulevard of Broken Dreams,"" ""Mood Indigo,"" and others. These performances are indicative of an artist with passion and artistry, and the fact that he is still loved and cherished after such a long career speaks volumes."
5,Two of the best words in vocal music.. TONY BENNETT!,"Because of You Tony Bennett,I Left My Heart in San Francisco where I enjoyed The Good Life. I also traveled the Boulevard of Broken Dreams where I became a Stranger in Paradise.If I Ruled the World I would Smile and Put On A Happy Face Night and Day.How Do You Keep The Music Playing? When Joana Loved Me and the Shadow of Her Smile! Oh When Do the Bells Ring for Me? It's When I am Steppin Out With My Baby in Blue Velvet and Mood Indigo! When you listen to this Tony Bennett C.D., You know The Best Is Yet To Come!!"
5,Hooray for Ima GoodEgg,This book is so fun! What a great story and the adventures of more to come is something to look forward to. This little character would make a great cartoon!
5,I even received an autograph..........,"Wonderful African sound. Samba has made many CD's, all nice!If you have been in East-Africa, buy music from Samba. You will not regret it."
2,Too violent for toddlers!,"Gosh, I put this on for my 2 1/2 year old grandson and I was very unhappy with the violent actions and depictions of a mean poodle and mean penguins as well as the hostile Granny! My grandson was fascinated 'cuz he's never seen such a thing before and I can tell you right now he won't see it again 'til he's MUCH OLDER! This is not a cute, cuddly story for young ones! It's my own fault for not reading more closely what the movie is about - I guess many adults and older kids may find this movie funny, it just doesn't do anything for me as an adult..."
2,Handle Problem,"Cooks well but the handles (plastic) start to crack and wear out very rapidly due to the heat, would not buy another after being scalded when handle broke off and boiling stew went all over, dangerous around kids."
2,"Nice, yet bad","Overall the ring looks fine, I think its colorful in good way. However, when I received the ring the middle stone moved. Now I'm left to either pay more to ship it back and hope for a new ring to be returned (hoping it will be made well), or I must have a professional fix it. Either way I don't think its worth any more money to return, or to get fixed. If they would have sent me a good ring that was made well(without moving stones), I would have enjoyed the ring (now its a pain.)"
1,It is just a demo......,"A previous reviewer, Murray Jacobs, warned the reader that this is just a demo. He's right, but I had to scan completely through Fairfield Language Technologies to find the real one,.... Seems like false advertising to me. There are a lot cheaper courses available that are very good. Try Traupman's ""Conversational Latin...."", both book and tape, or the ""Learn Latin Now!"" CD. ..."
3,not good for Mac OS X users,Decent program. It's a nice change from doing paradigms in Wheelock. The only beef I had with it was that it doesn't work in Mac Classic OS 9. I have to restart the machine in OS 9 instead.
4,Willard's PR journey,"It is the subtitle of Mike Willard's latest book, ""The Flak: A PR Journey,"" that is most descriptive. That the book meanders between entertaining vignettes from Willard's 30-plus year career in journalism and public relations and bits of advice - often based on painful experience - may bother some readers who want the book to be either biography or textbook, but ""The Flak"" recounts Willard's personal and professional journey, and it does a good job of capturing the essence of its author and explaining what has made him who he is today. The ... cover price is money well spent by those with an interest in public relations or politics."
2,Too little of everything,"too basic, short, and expensive :(The swimming teqnique is okay, but could have contained so much more, more drills etc..."
5,Extensive Research Leads to this Book as Gift Item,I was given the task by a mother/daughter group I'm in to come up with a book we could give our daughter's as they graduate from fifth grade. After extensive research I settled on this book. We hope the girls will turn to these quotations again and again as they mature. The topical organization will make the use of this book easy for them.
5,Great job!,"For Christmas, my mom bought me this book. I love reading all the quotes and how they're categorized into different subjects. Thanks for publishing a great inspirational book for girls today and keep up the good work."
5,A gift from the heart for my daughter,"As a mother, I am glad that women like Catherine Dee are out there promoting girl power! Just recently, my own pre-teen daughter asked me why all the heroes and good guys were, well-guys. I was hard pressed to think of any female role models that would be meaningful to her. The Girls' Book of Wisdom is full of good ones. I'm enjoying reading this book with my daughter!"
5,"A motivating, empowering book for girls (and grownups too!)","Dee's book is all about girl power! It includes quotes from women and girls that inspire and empower. The book speaks to grownups as much as it does girls. I'm 32 and got a copy for myself. Reading a page a day is a great way to get an extra burst of energy and ""can do"" attitude. For girls, these quotes will help build self-esteem and a strong, healthy sense of identity."
4,A controversial but well written book,"Remember all the World War II movies where a handful of American or British soldiers mow down scores of German soldiers because the Allies are smarter? Ellis' argument here is that the Allies won the war not by being smarter that than the Germans but by outproducing them in war material by a huge margin. Ellis produces a substantial amount of evidence to support his claims. For example, the famous Luftwaffe bombing of London in 1940 cannot compare to the tremendous number of bombs dropped by the Allies on Berlin. Part of the reason for discrepancy in production is that the Allies, as stable democracies, were quicker to put their economies on a war footing. Unfortunately, the innovations they used to increase production beyond levels previously believed possible did not extend to military tactics. The result were higher casualties and a longer war than might have othewise been the case."
4,The real story of World War Two,"This account of how World War Two was won is so different than the common conception in the western world. The author gets some of the minutia wrong, i.e no version of the JU 88 was slower than the HE 111, but overall he makes a very believable argument that without overwhelming numbers of men and material the Allies would never have won World War Two. The amount of blood spilled is scarey."
3,Best Hits,I like this CD cause it has memories of Europe for me but they did fill a lot of the CD with stupid songs. Other than that the shipment was on time and not a bad purchase.
3,in agreement...,"i also agree with all of the other reviews. i have a beretta, and this cover is WAY too baggy for my seat, and the snug flap did nothing, in fact it ripped right off upon gently tugging it thru the seat, the stitching where i sit ripped within 3 days, and everything clings to the velvet. i have purchased other seat covers by auto expressions, and had no problem,but with the 2 sets of amy brown ones ive had have been horrible..wasnt worth the hassle to send them back either. i would not recommend these at all.."
1,Cheaply made product,"I spent 50 dollars for these seat covers and a week after I got them and put them on, the drivers seat cover started ripping. I did not want to go through the hassle with returning and shipping and being on the phone. I just thought that since I had this opportunity to post this message, I would warn someone about buying this product. The stitching was obviously not done correctly, these should have lasted me for a long time, I won't order from Amazon again."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought these because I thought they were very pretty and they matched the color scheme of my car. And while they did turn out to be just as pretty as I thought, they don't fit the seats very well. They are sort of baggy, and the material of the seat covers is velvety and it clings to my clothing, so half the time, the seat cover starts to come off every time I get in and out of the car. I'll keep using them until they wear out, but I certainly would never buy them again."
1,Easily tear,"I ordered this a couple of years ago. They tore right away. They look nice at first but don't last very long. I would never buy this brand again, they are too cheap."
1,bad seat covers,"I purchased these seat covers,put them in my new 2010toyota carolla and the 2nd time my wife and I sat in them both seat covers ripped at the seams.These covers are junk and there is no place or phone number to make a complaint thru!I am vary disapointed in this product and Amazon.com"
1,no good,i don't recoment this cover if u have a nissan altima because this are over side in two world very bad
4,Office chair cover,"I bought this cover for a chair that I use in my office, I bought it to cover up stains that wouldn't come out, although it doesn't fit perfectly, because it's really designed for a car chair, it makes the chair look more attractive and unique."
5,Poetry in a novel,"The plot of this book almost doesn't matter. What does matter is the beauty of the language--beautiful writing in it's most sublime form: the reader is immersed in the world of the book.As another reviewer stated, the usage and structure is a little unusual, but once the reader becomes accustomed to the unique style it becomes transparent. We are on the streets of Philadelphia. We are in the minds of the characters.What more could you possibly want in a novel?"
4,Real Philly Streets and Tragedy,"Absolutely the way it is. Lopez fused a reporter's eye with a novelists' soul and artistry with no small success. Somewhat awkward stylistically- it feels like a new form- but very slightly diminshed. This is a page turner, a shocker and a fine story.Realistic art and tragedy- a slam dunk."
4,Gotta love the classics,"This book is written for children ages 6-9, and the story is great for the grownups reading it too! I feel like Jason is a back ground player and Medea steals the lead, where on pages 28-29 she convinces King Pelias' daughters to murder him. The actual murder itself is shown, the King is being held down, and the knife, dripping with blood, has just been thrust into the neck of the King. Then they ""boiled him in water."" On the promise that Medea would ""make your aging father young and strong again."" Beware little children, old school Greek story time might give you nightmares...."
2,Not to my taste.,"If you are looking for something that will build on the topic like a language primer, I suggest you keep looking. This text has topical chapters ('Magical dimensions', 'Trades and Skills'), but this did not come together for me at least.This may be good for many people, but I had the sense of watching a light discovery channel piece. In such a show, someone tells you the meaning of the sign for plow and field; then they pan across and inscription; then they tell you that it says that ""the evil ones came and sowed salt into the fields which then lay fallow for 17 years...""This could of course, mean that it is at the right level for some interests."
3,Good but not Great,"There's a lot to like here. OK, less than half of this cd is worth listening to. PDQ Bach, aka Prof. Peter Schickele, is an acquired taste for some. ""Low brow"" humor connected to ""high brow"" music in some cases makes for good fun. Pete's musical abilities are apparent all over the score(s) but the introductions, commentary, and non-musical moments now seem more sophomoric than when I saw him in concert years ago. The best and funniest and most joyful moments on this recording come from the 1712 overture and The Short Tempered Clavier, S3.14159, easy as 1. C major. All the rest is only modestly funny for all the creativity in evidence. For me, on a recording like this, I'd rather they left off the goofy introductions, except as absolutely necessary (for the sake of the music) and then let this mad musical mayhem speak for itself.All that said, you know I will be adding more PDQ to my collection. It is hard to resist and laughter--even in small sporadic doses--is good for the soul."
5,great release,This is a much better than most releases that I have used. I like it much more than the Allen release I started with.
2,Helpful Comments/Poor Diagrams,The book arrived in a timely manner and was a bargaiin in price. My skills are limited in DIY sewing projects. I am a visual person and so I was disapointed that the manual had fewer diagrams to follow. than other instruction manuals.
5,Quote from a review by John Story in Fanfare Magazine 99,"Writing in the May/June 1999 issue of Fanfare Magazine, reviewer John Story wrote of ""The Outermost House"": ""The music is simply lovely. Perera's exquisite ability to set English words is everywhere in evidence as well as his extreme sensitivity to instrumental and vocal color put to service in a text. This is a major addition to the choral repertoire. For choirs able to field the modest additional forces required it should become something of a staple of their repertoire. Albany has put us in their considerable debt by making this marvelous music available to the larger CD-buying public in such a fine performance and recording."""
5,"To understand transsexualism, read this book","If there is such a thing on the market as a definitive work on the phenomenon of transsexualism, this is it. Mildred lets us all understand the ""true selves"" of these unique people."
5,an excellent first book on the subject of transsexualism,"This book is excellent for those who wish to learn more about transsexualism. I found it very comforting for myself (I am a transsexual)-the title leads you to believe that it is useful only for friends, family etc., but this is not the case. Anyone who believes they are transsexual should read this one FIRST! It is very readable and non-technical. I have bought several copies for loved ones. It really is that good."
5,At last someone who understands us...,"I couldn't stop crying the first time I read this book. In fact I couldn't put it down. As a Transsexual moving through transition, I felt a spiritual bond with all of the other lost souls and the inner struggles we have had in our lives. At least I am not the only one in this crazy world.This book is recommended reading for anyone who wants to understand the whole 'Transsexual' thing and the struggles we place ourselves through (sometimes at the cost of isolating ourselves from our closest friends and families, losing our jobs, breaking up of families, etc). This is no easy path to travel and the ones we feel closest to need to read this book at least once."
4,"For transsexualism, this is a great book.","This was one of the first books I read on Transsexualism. It really breaks it down, gives lots of examples of typical transsexuals and it does a good job. I think the key word in the title is ""Understanding"" because it really does help you understand what makes a transsexual tick and what's typical of transsexuals.Pro: It's a great book for understanding transsexualism.Cons: There's some transsexual poetry towards the end, which is boring."
3,A bit outdated,"I may be going against the grain, but I found this book dated -- it just did not resonate with me. I think Joanne Herman's bookTransgender Explained For Those Who Are Notis a much better ""primer"" on transsexuality."
4,Sensitive Eye-Opener,"I've never had any personal encounters with transsexuals before and am not one myself, so my personal opinion of transsexualism was based on ignorance and second-hand opinions. I read this book out of pure curiosity.Reading this book opened my eyes to the plight of what transsexuals have to go through, all throughout their lives. It also helped me see things from a different perspective.The book is readible and sensitive, seeking for understanding rather than trying to defend.I thus recommend this book to anyone who cares enough to try to understand the fellow human being, even though that fellow human being may be ""different""."
2,Useful but kinda bland,"It's a great book if you have no idea about what transsexuality is, however, it also supports a very narrow perspective and ignores a lot of the other groups catagorized under ""transgendered."" I would have loved to see something a bit more open-minded (despite their best efforts), maybe even a little more thorough."
4,A Must Read Book,"This book should be read by every person who wants to learn more about the phenomenon of transsexualism. The authors could have emphasized that there are many so called transsexuals who believe that having SRS will make them a ""real"" woman. It ain't so! Perhaps readers need to also read the book ""Who's Really From Venus? The Tale of Two Genders"" by Dr. Peggy Rudd. A balanced person has a mixture of masculinity and femininity. Too many transsexuals and transgendered individuals try to have their masculinity removed through surgery or therapy. Every woman and man needs to have a balance of masculinity and femininity."
5,Awsome book overall,My only complaint about this book is that all of the references and background deals with adult transexual people. It would be nice if it were updated with references for children and adolesents. Overall I would highly recommend it. It is comprehensive and well written and provides an excellent knowledge base for the reader.
2,A COP From Florida,"This book was not what you would expect from a book claiming to help out law enforcement officers write good reports. This is more like an elementary school work book with tear out pages. If you are looking for a book that will help you write a better narrative for police reports, this book is not going to be it. It was amusing more than it was helpful."
5,Painless Police Report Writing; an English guide for Criminal Justice Professionals,"I ordered this book for my son, who is currently a Police Officer. He wanted a reference book that had grammar and punctuation references for accurate police report writing. He ordered a different book that was recommended and written by a Field Training Officer. He found that the book he ordered wasn't anywhere near as helpful and informative as the one that I ordered for him. He couldn't thank me enough for giving him this book."
4,Good for basics.,"This book has been criticized by some for being too basic, however, it is perfect for students who have the need for a brush-up on their English skills, or, people who are ESL students. The last two chapters go into detail about how to write reports, and, depending on the skill level of the students, the first few chapters can be used as a quick review."
1,BEWARE MISLEADING CAPTION!,"BAIT AND SWITCH!Title is ""bluetooth transmitter/receiver kit""elsewhere it is a ""car fm modulator.""The price indicates that it is the latter.BUYER BEWARE!!"
5,not for everyone but a classic,"The Tibetans have a far, far, more earthy understanding of religion than we in the west will ever develop.This book, for example, has to do with the spiritual and sexual adventures of a strange Tibetan saint who even the Tibetans approach carefully.Not for those who think that spiritual affairs and sex cannot be combined yet the book is a great classic even if the cultural context is untranslatable."
4,Hear these angels sing!,"This is the best Christmas recording from ""various artists"" that I've ever heard. The CD truly offers something for everyone, and the artists featured are able to retain their own unique styles while singing familiar, old carols or contemporary, original songs. Here you will find some beautiful voices and some thought-provoking, new Christmas songs that ought to be eventual classics. Everyone will have favorites (I certainly do!), yet almost all will find that the CD as a whole celebrates the spirit of Christmas in an appealingly brand new way."
5,A Great Collection of Christmas Songs,"Only six of these 13 songs are the classics (including ""Mary Did You Know""), and two of those are instrumental. But the original songs are catching and excellent.Favorites? ""Joy"" (Cindy Morgan), ""When The Time Is Right"" (Ginny Owens), ""I Choose You"" (Rachael Lampa), ""O Holy Night"" (Crystal Lewis), ""Sister Of My Soul"" (Nicole C. Mullen), and ""Rose of Bethlehem"" (Maire Brennan)."
4,A very good Christmas Album!,"I got this album last year beacause of the song Babe in the Straw by LEIGH NASH (NOT KEIGH NASH!...). She is the lead singer for Sixpence None the Richer, my favorite band. I got it mostly for that one song, but to my surprise the whole album is really good. In fact this year, this is the album I've been playing the most of all my christmas music! It has a lot of good artists on it like Crystal Lewis and Amy Grant (another one of my favorite singers!)"
5,This is real Hip-Hop to the fullest,"All I got to say is that if you really enjoy, live and breathe real Hip-Hop then you gots to pick this classic album up. This cd rates up there with other classic underground Hip-Hop albums like Wu-Tang- Enter the 36 Chambers and Jedi Mind Tricks- Violent By Design. Go cop this album fast and support real Hip-Hop.Dj Eric Hype, Baltimore's Finest"
1,battery laptop a30,i not aceip battery laptop a30 why?you charge my meney a long time i want you sent this item for me thank-hung ngo
4,like the product,"I've been using these for a while now and was delighted to find them here at a cheaper price than I've been paying at the retail stores. When I first got them I was a bit disappointed because the decals are really more transparent than the package let on. Maybe it's just my printer. I know that it's hard to make something on clear paper turn out anything less than see-through so I forgive them. Anyway, I found that I could back the transparent decals with opaque white adhesive shelf paper and make beautiful vivid decals. These decals print out very nice and clear. These are great for putting store hours in a window or making decals for your car. These have a mild adhesive so that they come off easily but make sure that you clean the glass well before applying otherwise they won't stick well."
2,so so,"not my cup of tea, perhaps you will like it., othewise if not a fan do not purchase it and waste money"
2,garbage,"I'm surprised this cd has been reviewed as well as it has... ""Alive"" is just so generic and the whole album follows suit. Anyone looking for cutting edge dance music ought to look elsewhere.. and oh yeah... the autotuned/vocoded vocals are terrible but its probably better than the natural sound of Kevin's voice."
2,Skip this One,"As a huge fan of Dick Hyman, I was unfortunately deeply disappointed in this CD. He plays beautifully as always, but the sound of the piano is awful. In the `hi-fi' world of recording there are sometimes strange ideas about how instruments should sound. On this particular recording the tone of what is in all likelihood a beautiful instrument is ruined by a poor job of microphone placement, and the poor taste to include far too much room ambiance in the mix. The end result is that of sonic mud. The piano sounds exceptionally bad in the mid range - clouded by disturbing phase problems, and being nearly unlistenable. One can only hope that someone will have the sense to re-record and release this, as the performances are apparently recorded to a MIDI system that allows playback of the piano without Mr. Hyman present. All in all this CD is a terrible waste of a great idea."
4,A Shipping Mistake - FLT is working on it,"Apparently a shipping clerk made a mistake in packing my box. The kind people at FLT are taking steps to remedy the situation. Thanks guys.I've only tested the Spanish and English (English was not listed on the box or in the manuals, indicating I got the wrong PowerPac CD). Aesthetically, the software is very pretty, and the multimedia used in the tutorials is well chosen. I had to look in the manuals to figure out what some of the icons meant, though. Also, the GUI was built for smallish screens. Users with higher resolution hardware will still be able to use it, but with wide black borders around the active area (typical of Macromedia-type software).Overall, it's good solid educational multimedia."
2,Gets old fast,"This software has eight activities and that's about the best I can say about it.A major problem for us is that activity introductions last a while and our son is bored before the little characters get set up or quit talking, especially if he has already done the activity before. Secondly, it's not always easy for a baby to figure out what needs to be done. Get the mouse to the upper left corner? Connect the dots? A baby just wants to push buttons or move the mouse around.Finally, and I know this is my own personal bias, I think the animation is too primitive and the JumpStart Bear's voice is saccharin-y to the point of being creepy -- similar to PBS's Noddy but not so cute.We have several different baby software packages, and Reader Rabbit is far superior to the JumpStart product."
2,The Toddler I know wants only Weeder Wabbit Baby,"There are many things that I like about this software, but our 17 month old has no patience with it. If I even click on the Teddy icon he starts screaming No, No, Wabbit, Wabbit. For him at least, that bear talks entirely too much. And it seems to take forever for anything to happen. Maybe if he hadn't played with the Reader Rabbit Baby game first or maybe when he gets a little older it will be OK. But for now, it's Wabbit Wabbit."
2,"Limited Fun for Baby, Nightmare for Mom","JumpStart Baby Deluxe Edition was the first CD-ROM that I bought for my daughter when she was almost a year old. She found it fascinating the first handful of times that we played it together, but it seemed to get old pretty fast for her. She did learn basic cause-and-effect via keyboard banging, but she lost interest in the games quickly and some were actually quite confusing.As lapware, this was not a fun program to use. With lapware, the child sits on the parent's lap while they both attend to the game. It's a way for the parent AND child to interact together so that the computer doesn't act as a babysitter per se. However, I found the graphics very stilted and unappealing. Teddy was much too talkative and the animals were downright scary-looking. The baby performing fingerplays and dancing in the song section was nightmarish. I don't know what the JumpStart team was thinking when they released this version of JumpStart Baby."
1,"Too much talk, not enough of interest.","We got this for my son when he was about 1.5 and have tried it on him every month or so to see what he thinks. He is totally uninterested. There is much too much talking and too little time where he can do things. And the games provide him with very limited stuff he can do, and poor feedback for what he's done. He much prefers Read Rabbit for Baby over this."
4,Still Fun For my 3 year old,"This was purchased for my daughter when she was 7 months old - she really didn't grow into it until she was over a year, but at 3 1/2 she still requests it for some of the fun little games. I'm about ready to introduce it to my 14 month old son - It's great to have good beginner software out there."
2,not enough interaction,"My 18 month old is very bored with the program. He loves Reader Rabbit Toddler and was used to the rich graphics and having lots of input into the activities.When we tried Jump Start Baby he liked some of the activities, and the cute bear, but was frustrated that he couldn't choose the sequencing of events. For example, he liked the idea of putting clothes onto the bear, but he wanted to pick what to put on next and the program forced him to go in their order. This type of program flow frustrated him in all of the games.The graphics are disappointing as well."
4,Helping baby eat,"I bought this for my child when he was 8 months old.... mostly to entertain him during meal times. He loves all the screens and smiles and laughs when Teddy comes on the computer (he's 10 months now). Jumpstart has even helped our son to start saying, ""Baa Baa"", ""ruff"", ""hoo hoo"", and other animal sounds. My only complaint (and this is my husband's too) is that Teddy never shuts up... and is a bit bossy. :)"
2,after a comparison.......,"I first bought the reader rabbit series from the Learning Company, my 20 month old loved it. The activities are interactive and the music is very catchy.I recently purchased thejump start baby. My child was bored and disintersted. She kept asking me for ""Reader Rabbit"".I noticed after installing the jump start baby software my computer started acting weird and malfunctioning. I should have been more aware, as I purchased a copy of jump start baby about six months prior and it crashed my windows 98 system to the point of no return.After uninstalling jsb and all its subcomponents it seems my system is back to normal reliability.And that is my review!"
1,"Do yourself a favor, Check it out first","I would strongly urge anyone to check this product out before buying it.... This is one of the first we bought. It is very slow. Our bright enough baby was unable to establish any relationship between mouse movement and what happens on screen. The characters talk to the baby and tell her or him what to do. Babies do not get it. Our baby is now a toddler and this softwere is still useless. I suggest Reader Rabbit Baby, Reader Rabbit Toddler, or Sesame Street Baby and ME. Stay away from Sasame Street Toddler. It is very old, probably a Windows 3.1 progrem that needs a lot of updating."
3,"too slow to load and stop the songs,didn't like the graphics","my 18 month old daughter likes best the Reader Rabbit series:baby and toddler (since she was 1), and Sesame Street for babys. Gets bored easily with ""jumpstart baby""."
4,My kids ages 1 and 3 love it!,"This is the second time I'm purchasing this software (the first disk got scratched). I bought it 3 years or so ago for my son. He used it from ages 9 months and now my daughter loves it. She loves the songs, animals and putting teddy ""night-night,"" which makes it easier to stop playing when mom's had enough. My son enjoys helping his sister play the games now, which are simple enough to do on their own."
5,"EXCELLENT, GREAT","I read this book a few years ago and think that Mr. Oster had a great way to share his observations. It's VERY NICE to know that some one out there sees the mexican culture the way it is. I completely agree with his opinion.MARY, SAN DIEGO, CA"
4,A delicious mystery,"In this second book of the Chocoholic Mystery Series, Lee McKinney and Aunt Nettie are preparing for ""A Teddy Bear Getaway"", promoting winter tourism in their western Michigan town of Warner Pier. As part of the promotion, they are displaying a group of old chocolate molds which were brought to them by Gail Hess, a local antique dealer. Someone breaks into their chocolate shop in an attempt to steal one of the valuable molds and soon Lee's ex-stepson, Jeff, discovers a dead body, implicating him in the murder. Soon Lee is caught up in a little private sleuthing in an attempt to exonerate Jeff. She also is dealing with her ex-husband, and trying to figure out her relationship with Joe, a local man who expresses interest in her,yet is reluctant to take her out in public. This book is more interesting than the first one of the series and has a more satisfying conclusion. I will look forward to more Lee McKinney books in the future."
3,But can you ever go wrong with chocolate?,"This is book two in a series I started a long while ago, and was slightly indifferent about at the time. There wasn't anything about the first book that grabbed me and said I had to read more, but I didn't recall it being abysmal, either. And I found myself liking the second book more, though I still can't really identify with the main character. I like the idea of the story (the mystery flows well, good twists, etc) if not the actual telling of the story. The ending was quite expected, but it takes quite a bit to surprise me these days... It's a nice, simple cozy, nothing fancy."
3,Too Sweet,"This book is too sweet for my taste. Former Texas Beauty Princess Lee McKinney, now cocoa bean counter in her Aunt's shop in the ""Tourism Central"" Western Michigan fictional town of Warner Pier, Michigan, is amateur sleuthing through the snow. Stir in non-sequitur ""Chocolate Chat"" tidbits and the heroine's ""tang tonguele"" (tongue tangling impediment) and you have a too-cutesy-by-half milk chocolate mess that melts in your hands.

4,Solid effort all the way through....,"I'll admit that I was very much into the Brit scene back in the early 90s, and that probably makes it very easy for me to love this CD. It's not breaking any new ground, but it is a solid effort all the way through. It's one of the few CDs that I put in and just let it play. Sadly, that's rare these days for me. If you are looking for a good alternative CD that will bring back memories of Stone Roses and Charlatans, get this CD!"
3,A Solid Effort,"Unlike many of the reviewers, I am not a fan of Morrisey or the Smiths. I found out about Johnny Marr and this album pretty much through radio play of the song ""Down on the Corner."" I think this is a great track and extremely catchy, and I wondered what the rest of the album sounded like. This may not live up to the ""standars"" Smith fans expect, but I thought a number of the tunes were really good and the album as a whole very listenable.Standout tracks for me were the aforementioned ""Down on the Corner,"" ""Last Ride,"" and the trippy ""Headland.""Not being Smiths fan, I don't know how people were disappointed with this CD, but it has grown on me with each listen. I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could."
4,"Not earth shattering, but so what","OK, it's not The Smiths etc. I don't care. What's wrong with rock solid pop played with style and taste by excellent musicians? I know a lot of people who hate the new CDs by Wire and The Buzzcocks, too. I, for one, am quite happy to have such geezers still very much alive and kickin'"
2,Stone Roses B-sides,"What a shocking dissapointment. Love the man and his former work, but this is.........really..........weak."
1,Terrible.,"I picked this up for one dollar in a used record store. I paid too much. It's terrible. Johnny Marr needs to embrace his inner jangly guy, not run from him. Now we know who the real genius of The Smiths was, and it ain't Johnny Marr."
2,what happened?,"Maybe Johnny Marr wanted his name to be added to the long list of musicians who were once great, but inexplicitly went stale either forever or in spurts (Rod Stewart, Paul McCartney, Prince, etc.).The perplexing thing about this CD is that Marr wrote some of the best music in rock history, nearly 80 songs in just four years - a vast majority of them excellent and ground breaking. How does a person just turn that off? Even though Electronic was good, I always got the sense Sumner was the real talent behind the show - they always sounded more like New Order than Johnny Marr.This CD may have confirmed what was suspected all along - Marr's best days are behind him. Still, Marr has never totally sucked or hit rock bottom, it is just that when compared to his other work, this CD is pretty slight."
1,"plodding, unimaginative, ultimately painful","this is the first recording of his that seems almost completely bereft of that trademark marr magic-the impeccable songcraft, the tasteful guitar fills, the lush textures. instead, it sounds like a callow attempt to copy oasis at their most bombastic. i heard johnny's been close to the gallagher brothers, but musically i don't think his strengths have ever had much in common with theirs. he should go back to hanging out with bernard butler, the true heir of the marrsian tradition."
1,Huge disappintment,"I can't believe that this is the same man who inspired so much of my own personal approach to pop guitar playing. I don't know what he's going for, but he should stop. I was so excited to hear this album, to hear Marr without Morissey, having heard Morissey on his own, and it truly upset me with every track. I actually threw this cd into the garbage (something I have never done before). Johnny, think more about your guitar playing than your clothes."
2,Not Yet,"Wow!The words Johnny Marr and Genius sure get tossed around like pennies at a wishing well. He is an adept texturalist with the guitar and a solid writing partner (no doubt) but a genius? I was eager to sit down with this CD because I wanted to hear what he would do left to his own devices. I discovered he has a voice that is easily enjoyed and he has a nice sense of melody. I found nothing interesting about the rest of his band; they seemed distracted or (dare I say) bored. Ultimately I was a bit bored as well with the overall work however there are fine moments, if you think Johnny Marr is a genius try Steve Wynn's music, he's from a similar era and background but is a whole lot better at writing his own material and he plays guitar (very well) too."
1,Enormously Disappointing,"I've been a Johnny Marr fan for years. He's undoubtedly gifted, likes to experiment and seems to be comfortable in the role of the quiet talent behind the flamboyant front man (Morrissey, Johnson and Sumner.)Historically, you could always count on one thing---if Marr is in the works, the album will contain at least one, really solid composition.In ""Boomslang,"" you'll find no such animal.This album is simply wretched...tired rock riffs, whining tenor vocals, banal lyrics and unmemorable production.Nothing against Marr--it's just a bad album. Even the best artists produce garbage on occasion."
2,"Johnny, what happened to your talent?","I bought this CD several months ago and I have sincerely given it plenty of time to try to like it. I have listened to it on long road trips, while relaxing at home, and I still don't like it. I am a big fan of ""The Smiths"", I own and love all of the albums, singles, and remixes. I also am a fan of ""New Order"" and ""Electronic"" and the other bands that Johnny Marr has teamed-up with. I had high hopes when I got this album, but I was not impressed with the dull and stale sound of this album. Johnny Marr's vocals are not good, but I don't mind them. The music is not what you would expect from the musical genius of the melodies of ""The Smiths"". The music drones on and on like a downtrodden heroine addict song. If you are considering buying this album, and you are looking for music like Marr's previous work, Don't, you will waste your money on this album. So Johnny, what happened to your talent? Did you give-up the musical ghost? Is the music really that bad? YES."
3,he's having fun,"I agree that this is not a monumental first solo effort for a very talented performer. And that's too bad. I do however want to tell Marr fans out there that Johnny is at least having fun. I saw him play about two weeks ago, in a small club, and it was a truly great show. From the first note to the last, the band pumped out a fantastic sound, great mix, very nice guitar work without resorting to any Smiths cliches, and amazing drum work. Johnny appeared to be really enjoying himself, doing funny little rock cliche moves, gyrating his hips. The band members as well all played their hearts out. Marr chit-chatted with the audience, with not an ounce of pretence or attitude. It was refreshing to see a rock legend in a small club, in a not-sold-out show, putting forth such a solid effort. Above all, though, the songs (albeit with forgetable lyrics) sounded altogether excellent. If you can see him in your town, go! (And while you're at it, buy his record...)"
2,undistinctive,"A Johnny Marr fan---this Johnny Marr fan---finds himself asking how one of the most distinctive guitarists in history could make such a bland, undistinctive record. There is nothing to set this record apart--nothing that would let you know of the HUGE talent that produced it. One could be charitable and call it 'understated,' but this listener just ended up disappointed. And I'm not asking to Mr. Marr to recreate his---what other word is there?---distinctive guitar work from the Smiths. Still, one expects more from a guy who may be the best all-around guitarist of his generation. Am hoping for more from the follow-up."
3,OK but nothing special,"Well everyone had lots of expectations, this being Johnny Marr and all. I have had this CD for quite a while now and it just isn't all that impressive. The songs sound an awful lot like the Charlatans UK to me. Someone said not to compare this to Oasis, it doesn't compare, the least steller Oasis album is still a notch above this. On the positive side this isn't bad either, just not great. If you like the early 90's psychadelic leaning brit-pop sound than this is right up your alley."
3,OK,"""Down on the Corner"" is excellent. It has such a wonderful melancholy feel and it builds to a perfect conclusion. It's definitely one of my favorite songs from all of 2003. Other than that, not a whole lot jumped out at me from Boomslang. There's a few more decent songs (""The Last Ride,"" ""You Are the Magic"") but nothing to match the quality of ""Down on the Corner"". The album is definitely worth a listen, but not much more than that."
3,Mixed Emotions,"I have to agree with several reviews written, as this long awaited album from my favorite guitarist is a bit disappointing. The catchy hooks, multiple layering, and signature chord changes are simply absent. The songs are quite basic and predictable. Not bad in any way, but unexpectedly plain. To hear the brilliance of post-Smith's Johnny Marr, look no further than Electronic's Twisted Tenderness and Raise the Pressure. Both albums are incredible and highlight Marr's abilities."
2,"Too Little, Too Late","Being a big fan of the Smiths, I was pleased enough to finally see a Johnny Marr CD that I overlooked the mediocre Rolling Stone review. Big mistake. Take a listen to the Smith's song ""How Soon Is Now."" Then play it 11 times, over and over. All of the songs on this album sound the exactly the same--it's virtually the same arrangement, the same guitar/drum/synth sound, without variation. Top that off with the fact that Marr can't sing very well, and cannot write lyrics (no, I didn't expect Morrissey caliber lyrics, but still.) Yes, he can play a mean guitar, but that's not the most unique attribute in the world of Rock n'Roll. Too bad he & Morrissey couldn't hook back up. HIS albums haven't been that good lately either."
2,too much unexplained navy/intel jargon,"This is the second Gordon Kent novel, and I found the Navy jargon---MARI, comm plan, etc.,etc.--left me puzzled what was going on, with no explanation, and very distracting for an army grunt.Stopped reading both of them 50 pages in and never finished either one."
4,peace of mind,"I purchased this carrier to use in the pool this summer. My daughter is now 4 months and we used it just this past weekend. I wanted this product after seeing a similar one in a magazine. It worked well and gave me peace of mind, knowing that I couldn't drop her. Of course I still held on tightly and the buoyancy of the neoprene helped keep her afloat. I subtracted 1 star because I thought the fit was a little loose. I would have preferred a slightly more snug feeling when wearing the carrier. Overall I think it is a fine product and glad I bought it."
2,Not so great for little babies,"I used this water carrier with my first daughter, and I always felt like she was just sort of dangling in front of me. Also, it wasn't that comfortable for me to wear her this way. I just bought a water wrap baby carrier (baby faces toward my chest) for my second baby, and I am much more pleased with the snug fit. If you have a super active older baby who likes to face outward and can tolerate an awkward fit, this might be your product. But if you prefer a snug fit or have a smaller baby who likes to be close to momma, this isnt' the best water carrier."
2,Looks dangerous to me...,"You can't adjust for depth of the water. This is semi safe in a pool...maybe ok, and deadly in an open water setting like a lake, river, or ocean. If the water rises or you slip, in goes the baby. Even in your arms you could raise the child over your head. I would never buy or recommend a product like this. Floating seats are FAR safer. Like this:Baby Spring Float Sun Canopy by Swimways"
4,Possibly his best yet (4.25 stars),"Coolio in my opinion has basically been gettin better and better as his carrer has gone but his amount of fame and radion play has been a bit up and down. This album has coolios showing a bit more maturity in some songs like ""what is an mc"" but he also has some fun and catchy songs like ""I like girls""(possibly my favourite track"", this album also has a few well credited artists such as B-real of cypress hill, daz dillinger of the dogg pound and krayzie bone of bone thugs n harmony. I highly reccomend this album to any fan of coolio's."
3,Pretty heavy adapter,"Since there is no extension wire for this, we have to connect it directly to the terminal. I am finding it difficult to use with my bose speaker's adapter(which is again equally heavy). It also smells a lot while in use. Again, you can use it with only one device at a time."
2,Fuse did not work - unit blew up!,"I'm disappointed to report that my unit blew out after a few days of modest use. It was plugged-into a standard 220-volt outlet in a UK hotel. But it overheated witin 15 minutes and had to be shut down frequently. Now I am using a Tacima step-down transformer. Look into the Proctor-SIlex model as well. This Recoton couldn't handle the job, and I was using the 50-watt setting."
1,Not Pleased,"We bought this product specifically for the use of a small, travel hair dryer which the product specs said it could accomodate. The converter broke within 2 minutes of using the hairdryer for the first time. In addition, the packaging was poorly designed and the many pieces did not fit together made and would not close. The product was heavy and instead of lugging it around during our travels in order to return it, we simply threw it away. P.S. I really wanted to rate this with zero stars but that was not an option."
5,Excellent.,"This kit is well made, contains all the plug adapters you'll need to travel to 6 continents, and unlike some, has switchable wattage to allow the use of both low voltage (eg. battery rechargers) and high voltage (eg. hair dryers) appliances."
2,seemed great but,This is a nicely packed unit and very easy to travel with.On my second trip to Australia the unit fuse didn't blow but the unit caught on fire. Targus has a very nice unit as I have now found out and it is much more compact.
1,Voltage Converter,"Be very careful on type of devices you plan on using overseas even when plugged into a voltage converter. While theoretically the converter reduces voltage from 230V to 120V, my daughter's hair straightener overheated and melted the adhesive holding the heating elements so the straightener was ruined. My only thought was that 50Hz frequency of the power overseas could cause greater current draw for heating devices such as hair dryers, coffee pots, straighteners. The voltage converter cannot modify frequency from 50 Hz to 60 Hz. Most battery charging devices for laptops, cellphones, camera battery packs operate on 120/240 50/60 Hz and will not need the converter but you will need the plug adapter for the wall outlet. Look at the rating label on each device to confirm."
1,Caution - This converter will distroy your hair iron,"The description and documentation of this device is inadequate and dangerous. The 1600 watt setting only works with pure resistive devices (and how would you know). When I used it with the Farouk Chi hair iron, the electronics in the handle of the Chi smoked and burned, destroying the iron. There is no guidance or information provided indicating which devices will work with this converter and which will be destroyed.The 50 watt setting worked well with small electronics, but I hate to think what would happen if the switch was left in the 1600 watt position by mistake.My advice is to get a dedicated 50 watt transformer for your small electronics, not this device.I am still searching for a solution for higher wattage devices."
3,Voltage Converter lets me down,"I can't say for sure but, after working well for one day, the second day that we tried connecting an expensive piece of medical equipment Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) to the converter, the equipment overheated and died. I can't confirm that it was the converter's fault, but then again, I cant confirm that it wasnt since we are back in the states and dont have 220 volts to test it with.Bottom line was that we were stuck in Spain with a broken machine - worth over $700 which was necessary for my own personal health.The cost of replacement in Spain was 1000 euros (over $1200) a very unexpected expense."
3,With which device should this thing not be used?,"Some one had asked if this converter could be used with a play station. No body answered. My question is: Can it be used with laptop computers? The editorial says this converter is good for certain identified devices, ending the enumeration with the cryptic ""etc."" But knowing which devices this converter should not be used is more important than knowing the devices with which it can be used!"
1,Not a fan.,"Despite the many reviews stating the poor quality of the product I thought I'd give it a go based on the few reviews in its favor. I should have listened...and you should too. The converter is worthless, but if you're wanting to spend a bit more just for the adaptors go for it, but I'd look elsewhere. After merely turning on the electrical device the converted popped, smoked and was no longer effective...or rather, was NEVER affective."
1,Misrepresentation,"I bought this converter on the premise that I would be able to use my Sony 15 Minute Rapid Charger with it. Turns out you cant, as it has a MASSIVE gap of usable wattage. I cant use any appliance from 50-500 watts. If you use it, you risk damage to your appliance and the converter. My Sony charger is 80 watts, and it cannot be used with it. This wasnt specified in the description, and I am very upset that I now have to return this product.Pass on this, and buy something else."
3,Not Sure If This Works,I took this thing to Tokyo. It was basically a waste of space. I'm not sure if it was the voltage in Tokyo or if I just got a busted piece of equipment. It would charge my phone with it but it would only last a few minutes so I just plugged it straight into the wall and it worked even better.
1,Where there's smoke.,"Took mine to China and had similar results, worked for about an hour, then started smelling something burning.Pulled it out hot AND smoking. May work OK for elsewhere, but not for China!"
2,"Low quality, but it did work for the whole trip.","When I first plugged this into the wall upon arriving in Italy, I smelled smoke after about five minutes. I unplugged it, and one side of the casing had started to melt. The next day I mustered the courage to plug it in again, and while it did get hot (REALLY HOT) it didn't melt any further and I didn't smell any more smoke.On the low-power setting, you can't run more than one laptop or a couple small things without it overheating...don't even try to run anything less than a big hair dryer on the high-power setting.All that said...it did run my laptop, charge the camera batteries, charge the cell phones, etc. for the whole 2-week trip."
1,Dangerours; be very careful,"Took this brand new unit to Switzerland recently. On first use, got very hot, partially melted and blew fuse. Was NOT overloaded. Replaced fuse, plugged into outlet with nothing plugged into it. Overheated and melted the case. If you buy, keep an eye on it whenever it is plugged in."
1,UNSAFE DO NOT PURCHASE!!!,"I see that some have had a good experience with this converter and to them I would say, ""Don't leave your hotel room with something plugged in! It's just a matter of time."" Like others in these reviews my converter made a loud POP and started smoking and melting. This was using it as per the instructions, too. Is it worth the risk?"
4,Works In UK,I used this product successfully in the UK to recharge my camera and heat the flat iron for my hair. I would not recommend keeping things plugged in overnight or left unattended to recharge. The main step down units gets very hot.
4,4 ****,"Well the converter is great, but it is ""heavy"" to travel with it. Perhaps all converters are heavy. The sippment and delivery was fast."
1,It blew up my Palm charger for no reason,"I bought it right before my trip to London, UK, and it was fine the first evening. But the next night I was trying to charge my Palm and use my laptop, it overheated while set at 50W (not 1600W) for no reason and blew up the Palm charger. I had to buy a new charger upon return.I hope this particular unit was a lemon, but I am returning it and looking for another product to replace it."
2,Overheats and stops working.,"I'm on Amazon today looking for a replacement for this exact converter. I tried using it on several trips...two in Europe and 1 in Asia. Each time, I had problems with it overheating and shutting off. It has now gotten to the point that it only works for about 10 min before turning off. While I never had smoke or sparks like the other reviewer, it has not been a great or reliable converter. On top of that, its very heavy."
1,Not a good experience,"I took it with me to China during a trip to pick up my adopted daughter. I used it in the hotel room to charge digital camera and cell phone batteries. It worked for the first hour or so, then a burning smell came out of this unit and it became very hot. I had to unplug it worrying that it might cause a fire. I did check if the switch was in the correct setting. I used 50W setting (low). Others who used it in China seemed to have no problem. Maybe mine was defective. By the way, most 4 stars or 5 stars hotels in China have 110V outlet for international travelers. If they don't have 110V outlet, they have a small converter that you can borrow for free."
1,Didn't work out so good!,"I was anxious to be able to use this device to charge my ipod, my rechargeable batteries and to use my blow dryer while on holiday in London. The first time I plugged in the appropriate adapter it blew a fuse in the hotel and burnt out the device. Didn't work out for me!"
1,Do not buy this at all,This converter burnt out within a few hours of use in Europe.Was greatly inconvenienced by this.Should have brought something from a more reliable manufacturer
4,Travel Converter worked great but the plastic holder should be tossed!!!,"The converter worked great but the plastic box that holds the converter et al is HORRIBLE! It was difficult to open & close the plastic box. My hands suffered with scrapes, bruises & cuts from trying to open the darn thing. It was difficult to get it to close properly as well as getting it to stay closed.We used this kit on a recent two week trip to Munich, Val Gardena, Cortina & Venice. The converter worked just fine. I used the transformer/converter on low wattage to recharge a digital camera as well as on high wattage for my curling iron. I too found that my curling iron heated up faster than at home. The converter brick grew medium hot & had an electrical scent to it while in use. It needed to cool for a few minutes before packing away."
1,Disaster,"I am in China and needed this converter so that I could use my coffee maker that I brought with me from the USA. I had the converter set to 1600 watts and when I plugged in the coffee maker, zap a puff of smoke. The fuse on the converter blew so after putting in a new one, I plugged it into the outlet and used a voltage tester to check the voltage at the 50 watt and 1600 watt settings. At 50 watt it was 120 volts and at 1600 watt it was 220 volts, yes I'll say it again 220 volts. What happened to the 120 volts that it is supposed to be, one word for this item garbage."
3,Poor case for storage and travel,"The actual converter and plug adaptors are great, but the case is poorly designed, does not close well, and everything falls out............very disappointed."
3,"Ok, but not great",I bought this for a trip to France. The plug itself was quite heavy so I had to support it with a book to keep it in the wall (or I suppose you could have someone hold it in).I repeatedly charged my camera battery (low) and used a hair dryer (high) with no problem... but my flat iron was detroyed/fried after 3 days useage so my review is mixed.
1,eegah!,SORRY - DAN HILL IS NOTHING BUT CANNED WHITE SOUL. PROCESSED AND PASTUERIZED WITH ALL ESSENTIAL VITAMINS AND MINERALS REMOVED SO AS NOT TO AFFECT OR OFFEND. LIKE JOHN TESH WAS THROWN IN A BLENDER WITH PEABO BRYSON. PROBABLY TRANSFERS EASILY TO ELEVATOR MUSIC.
4,Priced fairly,The book does not list every step of drawing the pictures but does provide enough detail. Younger drawers (5-7) may need more assistance than older drawers (10+). It is priced fairly.
2,Not that great... :-(,"This tells you almost nothing about drawing horses!!!!!!!The body structure in this book is wrong, they create colours that have never been horse colours, and make the horse look all bendy with no proper joints!This should be given a 2 star, and if you really want something to teach you, get either The Usborne Compeate Book Of Drawing or Draw Horses, or maybe even Draw 50 horses"
1,"Includes evolution ""theory""","This basic drawing book includes pictures of a ""prehistoric"" horse conveying the message of the evolution theory. It contradicts the beliefs of those who identify with the creation theory, and it would be more acceptable to everyone to leave that out. There are several other excellent horse drawing books that include only horses we KNOW that existed."
1,Too elementary,"I travel frequently and would like to be able to navigate on my own and speak simple phrases in order to be courteous. I have found better material in phrase books for the German language. This is far too elementary. It is useful as far as hearing correct annunciation of words, but not otherwise. Knowing ""the horse jumped"" is not helpful when trying to purchase train tickets, find directions, or reading a menu."
1,fell apart in a few short months,I am very disappointed with this item. In just a few short months all the stitching ripped exposing the metal bars inside. The product is now completely useless!!
5,"Very cool, a great deal for the functionality","3 functions in one - cupholder, bag, and tissue box holder. Works well and tidies up my car, for a low price!"
3,"it's a garbage bag, c'mon really?","It's a garbage bag. Fits on the back of the seat, contains the trash. Mission accomplished."
2,Below Par,"I purchased this item to sit on the front floor of my Honda CR-V (rather than hang over the seat.First off the material felt cheap so not sure how long it would last. Next, there is a strip of velcro on the bottom to of the litterbag to hold the tissue box in place and didn't appear that it would hold the box well when hanging the vehicle is moving. Lastly, it didn't fit well where I wanted to place it so I gave it to my parents. Not sure if they use it or not.The concept is good but falls short in quality in my opinion."
3,car liter bag,Not to sure how this will work. Seems a bit flimsy. Wish I could find something more sturdy. It seems that autos would come out with something in the car that could be used as a trash bin..
3,Colorful but limited,"The pictures are very nice and the software provides a fun way to learn some basic words and phrases. It's a good basic introduction to the language. If you really want to learn how to read Chinese, though, or even understand how the characters work, you'll need a good textbook and possibly a Chinese reading & reference software program like Clavis Sinica."
3,not a happy camper,"if you really, really like to learn mandarin, don't waist your money,this program have many beatifull picture,but no have a book to fallow, you my think that you learn to say HOUSE went they mean something out...also chinese explore don't teach you the 4 diferent tone for speak mandarin , better buy any book with tape record in any bookstore."
1,Old software==RosettaStone,"This product is so old the box was yellow. System compatibility on the box was win 3.1,98 and NT... So I think that it is older than ME or 2000 (8 to 10 years old). It wouldnt install on my XP notebook. :-("
5,Welcome to the Nuclear Age,"100 Suns is the best collection of nuclear test pictures in one volume that I've seen. The descriptions of the blasts are interesting and factual, and are in the back of the book so as not to detract from the pictures themselves. There is also a good chronology of weapons development in the back of the book. If you have any interest in seeing what the awesome power of splitting or fusing atoms looks like, this is your book. This is a most unusual coffee table book which should start many fun conversations."
1,Very Poorly Formatted,"If you're buying this book to have beautiful photographic prints of the major nuclear tests, you will definitely be disappointed, as I was, by the book's very poor format/layout. The overwhelming majority of the photographs are printed in such a way that the image is split apart where the paper joins the spine of the book. In other words, you get maybe three-quarters of the photograph on one page, and the remaining quarter on the facing page. What's worse is that many of the photographs are split right in the middle, so the image is completely ruined. I can't believe that they were so stupid as to produce the book in this way. If I had know it was this bad, I wouldn't have wasted my money."
5,Stark beauty of a devastating weapon,"As terrible as a nuclear detonation can be, this book manages to capture the spectacle and beauty from the above-ground nuclear tests conducted at the Nevada Test Site and other detonation sites in the 50s and 60s.The book is a collection of 100 colour and B&W; photos from the US National Archives and LANL of various detonations. Some are taken mere milliseconds after detonation and show fascinating detail. Others show the detonations with soldiers looking on. Aerial shots show the impressive scale of the detonations.Captions for the photos giving details on the test are listed in the back so as not to distract from the photo itself. It's an interesting book to look through and to see the scale of the above-ground nuclear weapon testing that was done in the middle of the 20th century."
1,It would be awesome if I had it.,"My friend had this book at his place, so I decided to order it. Unfortunately I never received my copy and so far Better Book World has refused to give me a refund even though I've asked several times. I would recommend this book, however I now strongly oppose using Better Book World they have some of the worst customer service I have ever encountered. I still don't have this issue resolved and I ordered my book over a month ago. Again DO NOT ORDER FROM BETTER BOOK WORLD!!!"
3,Not big enough...but nice,"I really like the supply case, and it is great to use one side (double sided) for storing 12 X 12 sheets without worry of wrinkling or tearing. It just isn't big enough to carry everything you would need to a cropping session. But nice storage."
4,Bridget's Review,"I'm a picture fanatic. I love being able to look back on important parts of my life and remember what I felt like at that time. ZoomAlbums are perfect to carry around in your purse so you can share special times with your friends and loved ones. You can use a computer, digital camera, camera phone or a scanner to collect your pictures. You will need a color inkjet printer to print out your pictures. I love being able to show off my nephew or my puppy to anyone who will take a peek. This is a handy invention that would make a great gift."
2,Doesn't work with most printers.,Information did not state that it only works on printers that feed straight through. If the paper has to bend to come back on the tray it jams. This information was given ONLY on installation and only said it didn't work on some printers. Mine wasn't listed but still jammed for the reason above. Great product if you have the right printer.
1,CD Cover Doesn't Match the Track List,"I started to purchase this cd; but upon reviewing the cover it plainly shows the following names - Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole and Danny Kaye, but none of those names appear in the track listings. If anyone knows the correct content and would be willing to post it; the information would be greatly appreciated."
3,Unusal Recordings Recorded Poorly,"Music is fine, but the recording of it on this cd is awful.Extremely poor fidelity."
3,"Works well, but..","I purchased this motor along with a new 12 inch mirror ball to use when I'm DJing. I've used it twice in the last four weeks, and am still using the same D cell battery I put in the motor when it arrived. From that perspective, it is great.My only complaint with this motor is that it is geared a bit high. The mirror ball spins a bit too quickly, causing the reflected images on the floor and walls to move at stomach churning speed. After it had been in use on the same battery for 8 hours, it had slowed to a more normal pace. I haven't found any way to adjust the rotation speed on the motor, and I am hesitant to take it apart. This may not have the same effect on a large mirror ball, say 20 inches or larger."
4,motor for disco ball,"Works Great and the 12"" ball fits just fine. Wish it was a silver color instead of black. Takes away from the pretty of the ball."
5,Got the job done,"I used it for a larger disco ball and it worked just fine for the party. It kept it turning slightly, just enough for the lights to move around the room. Don't expect it to be spinning wildly or anything but enough to get the job done. I would recommend it."
1,lemon product,I cannot get it to turn.even with new batteriesproduct was slightly broken when it arrivedpiece was in the box
2,You get what you pay for,"Cheap. On/off switch does not work. Have to move battery around to start motor. Emailed company,but never heard back from them."
1,disco ball motor,"We ordered two of these for a Christmas party. It is a good thing I checked them, because neither of them work. There are no instructions, and I guessed it took a D battery. Now I tried it with a C, and still no go."
1,Crappy,"The motor needs a couple of different speeds. If you have a really big disco ball then this (very) slow speed should be fine. But I wanted to use it with a medium-sized ball, but it just turned too slow. I actually think the one I received was broken as it really did turn very very slow..."
1,Cheap crap; doesn't work.,"As has been stated repeatedly, this product simply didn't work when I received it and put in the battery. Very disappointing."
1,Poor Quality Mirror Ball Motor,"The first motor I received would hum and ""sometimes"" make a turn when holding ""upside down"". The Vendor was very quick in her response and immediately sent me a new one. Unfortunately, the new one did not work at all! Having received two motors that did not work indicates the quality of this particulate product is exceptionally poor. I requested a total refund. The vendor however was very efficient and accommodating and I was refunded my money immediately."
4,Get the 1997-2001 set from their website...,"its much cheaper at the nightwish.com store... 60 bucks is crazy. however, you should DEFINITELY buy something of theirs! they are amazing powermetal (melodic) with a classically trained female singer. they're finnish, and they're insane. the drummer and guitarist are both excellent (i don't know anything about bass players so i can't comment ;-) so BUY THE BOX SET! (at nightwish.com)metal forever!\m/"
3,The Best Band around,"Definitely a must get for fans of ""Actual"" Music... Tarja has the greatest voice around..but This Limited Edition (Wishbox) isnt worth the price when you can buy the Nightwish 1997-2001 Boxed Set for 50.99- 4 CDS instead of one for 10 bucks cheaper.Oh one thing its cheaper on Nightwish.com so you are meant to think but one thing you should realize...Shipping fees..if your in the States youll pay extra for Oversea delivery"
5,An Excellent Book - Buy it NOW!,"Finally, we have a book to share with people who can't understand why meat is poison. I've been a vegetarian for 13 years and my 5 year old son has never eaten animal corpses (and he's never been sick!). Mr. Lyman has provided us with some heavy-duty ammo in our quest for good health. Someday, the burger comglomerations will wake up and put some meatless items on their menus (besides salads) for those of us who don't wish to poison themselves. Mr. Lyman's book was an excellent read and I hope there's a follow up. He presents some totally convincing arguments as to why one should NOT consume animals. Buy it now and educate yourself!"
5,Eye Opening,"Who Knew? Well I thought I did, I thought I had a pretty good idea about what goes on in the meat industry, but after reading MAD COWBOY my life changed. I was a new vegetarian and I wasn't sure if I was going to last. I was a meat eater for 30+ years. Before I even finished this book (in 2 days) I had no doubt I made the right choice. Warning: A very strong stomach is required for some parts of this book. The graphic descriptions my make you physically ill, but it is worth the discomfort to gain the knowledge.Another reason why this book hits home more than any other I have read is due to the fact that the author is a former cattle rancher. This fact makes the claims credible."
5,"If you are considering reading this book, don't think twice",This book is very eye opening as to what really goes on in the beef industry. I wish I could get everyone I know to read it. I don't have any desire to eat beef again. I never thought I would ever say that. Thanks for a great book Howard!!!!
3,A fairly good read,"Within the last half year, I read Eric Schlosser's ""Fast Food Nation"". So, when I came upon this title, I was interested specifically in what a rancher has to say about the business of meat.Mr. Lyman is quite clear in his message, although he does become a bit preachy at times. For example, he decries the abuses of the ""Zone"" diet. While one may agree whole-heartedly with him, his argument goes on at length (a whole chapter).This book has made me think about my own diet and has moved me enough (with support from Schlosser) to give up eating meat. So while the writing is fair, the message is great."
1,Digestive Tract,"Instead of the ""insider's analysis"" of the meat industry I was expecting, this book turned out to be a pretty didactic and unconvincing diatribe on the health benefits of vegetarianism."
4,This Book Opened My Eyes and Changed My Life,"Before reading ""Mad Cowboy,"" I was a confirmed meat eater, although I did want to cut back on or eliminate more and more meat from my diet for health reasons. The book confirmed the wisdom in doing that, but it also opened my eyes to the cruelty done to animals and the destruction done to the planet all for the sake of my taste buds. Now I'm committed to doing my part to alter that by becoming a vegan.Do yourself and the planet a good turn: Spread the word about how important it is to read this book and take its warnings to heart.Bless you, Howard Lyman!"
5,Mad Cowboy is informative and honest. Buy it now!,"Howard Lyman has taken his own experiences as a former rancher and meat eater to create an extertaining and informative book. I couldn't put Mad Cowboy down. I bought copies for my family and friends who still don't understand why I'm vegan. I believe Mad Cowboy will reach people who aren't swayed by other vegetarian books. Howard has so many interesting stories to tell, I hope to see another book in his future."
4,"good product, fast shipping","the only problem i had with this product regards the shipping. the estimated delivery date was a month after i bought the product but it actually came within a week of it being shipped out. the product was in good condition, just as it was described"
5,Mad Cowboy,"This book was so enlightening to me. It has changed the way I look at so helath , nutrition, the environment etc. I will pass this book on to as many friends as I can who will read it. Once they've read it they will not look at meat the same. Thank you Howard F. Lyman for writing such an invaluable book."
2,Sound Quality Leaves something to be desired.,"Buyer be ware: you certainly get what you pay for! Beggining with the first track, you can tell that the technicians spared every expence in converting the music from the old LP's or whatever. Still, it's good for far in the background Christmas music with a lot of family over, and no one's paying attention to the terrible quality, anyway."
2,Faulty iBook,"This is my fifth Mac laptop and a problem that I had with the second one I owned has made a surprising comeback.The cursor jumps around the page while you are typing, so that you can be in the middle of the fourth line of text and all of sudden the cursor has 'jumped up to the middle of the secondline.I'm a decent typist, but this is an impossible situation. I can't type more than aline or two without it happening, and as one can imagine, it's a huge pain. I'm not talking about a typo here there but an entire train of thought broken up and inserted into a previous line.Don't buy this model until they fix it. You can get an idea about this from the Apple Support discussion pages. I'm not the only one this has happened to, and you'll be able to track what Apple is doing to address the issue through the discussions.It's a wonderful product in general, but wait until this bug is fixed."
2,Disappointed,"Well, being a long-time Trekkie (TNG is my favorite), I was quite disappointed with this book. Liked the premise, liked the characters, did not like the execution. This book, the 1st of a 3 book trilogy had way too much talk and background info for my liking. It appears the author took 1 exciting book and split it into 3 much weaker parts. Profits are the only reason I can think of why this was done."
3,Another Q book,"While I used to be a fan of ST:NG, I never particularily liked the Q storyline. Above and beyond the fact that I dislike superpowerful entities, the Q himself is extremely bazzare. Still, if you a StarTrek fan looking for an intertaining book (and if you don't mind the usual slapstick comedy that seems to go along with Q involvement)you might enjoy reading this. As you might have realized I have found the authors writing style mediocre. And do we have to have this stretched out into three books!"
2,boring,"I hate to say it, but I was very disappointed in this series of books. You really can't review just one book you have to do all three. It was a good idea, but way to long winded. Very boring..... If you like Q ( which I do) you might want to read it to get some history on Q."
3,Not bad overall,"I enjoyed this series of books although I found it to be a little long winded at times. It could have been knocked down to two books instead of three. Overall I thought it was a good story. It gave a history of Q, and The Q, that help us to understand him ,and them, a little more. I was amazed at how many old story lines from the movies and the series he was able to bring together. If I had to comment on anything on the writing it would be the abundance of grammatical errors there were in all three books. I know that errors occur, especially if your on a roll, but aren't there supposed to be editors and proof readers to catch these. This has nothing to do with the story itself but I found soo many errors that I had to reread sentences to see if I read it wrong in the first place and I found this distracted me from the story. In the end I did enjoy the trilogy and would recommend it for all Q fans."
4,Awesome!!!,"This is a great Christian ska CD!! Every New Day had just become one of my favorite songs. Many of the songs include a good bit of humor. They sound great as well. My only criticism is that they could have more serious songs with a serious meaning like Every New Day. Still great, and I do think the humorous songs are great as well. A must have."
5,This Cd is killer,"I love this cd. Its the first FIF I heard. Once got it, I had to get the other ones. I think the lyrics about stupid things are cool, Things like him losing his comb and the song about his kitty and doggy. I aslo think its awesome how they can make christian music so cool. This cd is killer."
5,Everyone else who reviewed it likes it...I'm no exception!!!,"If I was forced to give up all 100 CDs of mine (many of which are ska), but I could keep one...this rockin' album by Five Iron Frenzy is the one I'd keep. I'm a Christian but I don't really like Christian music. However, when I heard this album I was blown away. THE WHOLE ALBUM IS GOOD. Superpowers, Suckerpunch, Blue Comb '78, Every New Day...all too good not to own. This is what ska is about!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,It all began with this album,"It all started when i was bored and went rummaging through my brother's CDs. As a pre-teen i hadn't found a kind of music i particularly liked but i remembered my brother getting Newest Album Ever as a present so i listened to it - and fell in love with Five Iron Frenzy. I thought it was so kool that a rock band had horn instruments. 5-Iron is definitely my favorite band and Newest Album Ever is very nearly my favorite album. You can't go wrong with the subtle humor in Suckerpunch and Superpowers and the hard rocking of Handbook For The Sellout and Fistful of Sand. Plus FIF goes all out in their love for God with Every New Day, one of the best songs i've ever heard. BUY THIS ALBUM U WILL NOT REGRET IT - SKA ALL THE WAY"
3,Not too much bang for your buck. I reccomend the pie.,"5 Iron frenzy is a relatively allright band. I'm not too much for this type of poppy ska punk, I'm more of a Hepocat/ Mephiskapheles groove trad. dancer sort of guy. But by the by, they're allright. It's just that they sound like many of the other cookie cutter ska bands out there. Ska needs quality, not quantity. If you really want some good Ska, I reccomened something Like Skavoovie and the epitones, The allmighty Toasters, and some mephiskapheles for good measure. Cheers, Skinheads!"
1,Sorry but I just don't like this CD,Come on now. Who wants to listen to a song about a comb. I mean the beat is good but they need lyrics. Don't buy this CD unless you want to listen to mindless dribble about stupid things. They need learn how to write songs!!!!
5,Worth every penny of your money!,"In Our Newest Album Ever by Five Iron Frenzy, the popular, yet still underground punk-ska band accomplishes exactly what they are trying to do. That is they blend melodic yet blazing ska, with punk vocals,and lyrics that are sometimes funny, and always Christian and/or uplifting. This is definately FIF's best work to date. I suggest you scrounge up some money any way you can and go buy it. You won't find better ska."
5,FIF At the top of their game,"This album is the third best by the boys (and girl) from Denver. Out Newest Album Ever is a perfect blend of all different types of songs that only FIve Iron could pull off. They have a real groove that they carry with them in each one of their songs. My personal favorites on this album are Every New Day, Handbook for the Sellout, Second Season (Dennis Sings and he has a rockin voice), The Godzilla Song (hidden track-excellent) Oh, Canada, and Fistfull of Sand. The only Five Iron cds that surpase this one are Live: Proof That The Youth Are Revolting, and The End is Near (They really left on top of their game and its really sad because The End Is Near is their best). Pick this one Up and see them live while you still have the chance."
5,Fantastic! Like a 90's version of Chicago!,"I really liked the positive strong upbeat. You're really never sure where the music and words are going so you listen with anticipation. Oh Canada! is a real scream. My friends in Canada thought it was pretty ""looney"" too."
5,Great ska even if your not christian,Really cool CD that exemplifies ska/punk in every way. A MUST-HAVE for a cool ska collection. = )
5,HOLY [CRUD]!!! GREAT SKANKIN TUNES FOR A SKA LOVER!!!,"WHAT CAN I SAY? 5-IRON NEVER FAILS TO AMAZE ME!!! This album is somewhat different from ubeats and beatdowns but every five iron album sounds different from the next. This is great ska/punk music. Songs like ""handbook for the sellout"", ""oh canada"", ""blue comb 78"", and heck nearly every song on this album will get you jumpin and skankin like crazy. Be sure to check out this and all of 5-Irons albums. They are all really good SKA."
2,"Smashed, gooey, and broken","Overall, it's probably not a good idea to order food items, even candy, over the web. This candy looked like it had been exposed to heat, jostled and probably stored on its side. Most of the candy had to be thrown out as the wrapping had split and taffy had leaked out.I got a few taffy bars out of this package, but I certainly wouldn't bother to order it again."
2,laffy taffy,"First off what you see is not what you get. The laffy taffy i got does not show the picture of the monster as the one pictured does,it is just normal laffy taffy,and on top of that when i opened the box almost all of them were open on one side and had exploded."
2,Very good but pretty basic,I like the program but it is way too basic...If you already know some Spanish then most probably this program isn't for you. I downloaded a shareware program called buensoft...and it has more advanced phrases to learn.
3,Good basic spanish vocabulary... for a child,"i boutht this program thinking i would brush up on spanish...at least to get back to the point i was at in a beginning spanish class in college. i was excited at first; but i soon hit the ceiling of the program after working with it for about an hour. i thought maybe i missed something so i put it away and came back to it later (a few months). i hadnt missed anything. the program is just shallow. it's good for a child who wants to say a few things but dont expect to learn spanish from this program..this program will teach you to say something like. ""the kids are jumping on the table"", ""the lady is on a horse""....things like that. you'd be better off checking out language tapes from the public library."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"BUYER BEWARE!You can never get rid of this item. Even if you never used it, never registered it, you cannot sell it.In my case I bought ($500) it for a job I was looking at in India, never used the item, didn't take the job.Rosetta Stone refused to take it back or even trade it for a different language, and when I tried to sell it they had the listing pulled for 'copyright violation'. After conversing with the company I learned that they buried a clause in their license agreement that the item could never be sold and they don't take them back.So buyer beware, once Rosetta Stone has your money they have it forever and you are stuck with this item forever.A very expensive doorstop that's not a very good doorstop."
1,Not for beginners,This course is for those with a basic knowledge of Spanish. It does not explain anything and translation is difficult. I wasted my money.
1,Overrated,This seems like a good program but it is just lacking some very crucial things which I think are necessary for language learning. The lack of verb tenses is extremely frustrating. Tying in with this is the complete lack of teaching grammar. See my problem with this is what's the point of learning the language if you don't learn the rules of it. Good product but fails in some important aspects to teach Spanish. For a good language learning software that also has grammar turtorials check out Spanish NOW by Transparent Language.
1,Useless!,"The Rosetta stone teaches you ""baby sentences"" like how to point at a blue car or see the ball near the child.It does not teaches you the language. There is no attempt at teaching you verbs and tense. It has nice pictures and you GUESS what the things are. Big, expensive disappointment. I suggest you try something else. I am."
4,Michael Martin Murphy - Ultimate Collection,Like most of the songs on this CD. MMM is a very unappreciated song writer and artist. This CD showcases his wide range of musical talent.
3,"Okay, Bought It For One Song","A compendium of MMM's best known songs. I bought this cd because it's the only cd that I know of that contains the original recording of ""Geronimo's Cadillac"", which was a big hit on my local radio back in the 70's. The obvious hits ""Wildfire"", ""Carolina In The Pines"" and ""What's Forever For"" are all here. Sound quality is a 7 out of 10. The rest of the cd is for hardcore fans."
3,Good enough for improviser.,"I hooked up my 10 inch kicker to my 500 watt boss amp today with this kit. It arrived in the mail but it was 10 gauge instead of 8. Because my amp wasn't too large it didn't matter but if you need a 700+ watt amp, I would look elsewhere.Some of the materials that came with the kit are not the highest quality. Some of the crimping connectors did not work the best. I ended up just stripping part of the wire and splicing them together.Th kit came with enough wire for me to hook it up in my single cab chevy. If you have a larger vehicle, such as a suburban, you may need to buy more cables. This kit comes with zip ties. It has only enough to keep wires together for roughly 8 feet. Might sound like much but you'll see it isn't that much.Overall I would say if you had a little idea of what you were doing you could do it by yourself. If you have no clue what you're doing, pay a professional to do it. You will have to use some ingenuity to do it though."
2,not gonna work,"its cheap, its thin, its junk. im not gonna even bother install this with a fairly expensive infinity system. id honestly be worried about something burning out or the entire car going ablaze. ive had some horror shows with my not-so-fancy electrical work before, and it pays to wire correctly. if your amp needs 8 guage wire, find it elsewhere."
3,Cheapest you can find,"Don't get me wrong, just because I said its cheap doesn't mean it is horrible. This product is for someone who got an amp and sub setup for free and doesn't want to invest in a higher quality setup, I don't think that this kit is any worse than the ones sold at walmart. Its comes with everything you need to set up a system. But the wires are definitely thinner than 8 gauge, like other reviewers have said."
2,Average Product,"Its an average product. My package had a faulty fuse and there were no extra fuses with this product, so the installation engineer from best buy had to use a 1 from pack of 4 fuses, which costs me more than this kit... Except that the kit was fine... I used it for the installation of my 400W Amp..."
2,"Not bad, but has a short ground cable","I was disappointed to find that this kit has only a 3 foot ground cable. The product description is a little confusing because of the way the lines are split across bullet points... I thought it meant that the fuse holder had 3 ft wires:* 20 Ft. 8 ga red power cable Competition high-quality fuse folder 3 Ft* 8 ga. black ground cable 16 Ft. 18 ga blue turn-on wire 20 FtFortunately, I had some 8 gauge black wire already so I used that - I never use the chassis ground for high current devices, it's better to run both ground and power back to the battery.The wire doesn't seem to be the same size as my existing 8 gauge cable, but it seems thicker than a 10 gauge, but I just ""eyeballed it"", I didn't make any true measurements. The insulation on the wires is thicker than ""normal"" wires so if you're trying to pull the wire through a small hole, that could cause a problem."
2,Just isn't that great.,"I purchased this while I was installing my subs. I was hoping that it would work well, but very skeptical due to the reviews. I was right to be skeptical, and the wire was not 8 gauge. I still used everything anyways, because it's all I had at the time. Now all I will end up using thom the kit is the fuse, the remote turn on wire, and the RCA cable. The wire was so small that it was causing my headlights to dim when my subs hit. Not recommended, just buy good wire from the start and save your money."
4,Great kit for anyone,This is a great kit that comes with everything that you need to get started. The speaker wire though is deffinetly not 16 gauge wire but i used my own 10 gauge speaker wire and it works great. The remote wire is kind of thin but it works and gets the job done. The RCA cable is of good quality and provides good sound and clearness. The red power cable is a good thick cable that is able to handle the volts from the battery along with a very good and durable fuse. This kit is a good quality kit that i would recommend for anyone looking for good sound and reliable wires. The wires were all long enough and I had plenty extra so it would work for a full sized vehicle as well as small vehicles.
2,Upgrade to a thicker gage.,I don't understand how its possible to rate the kit an 8 gauge. The power cable and ground are insanely thin. If your going to spend a ton of money on your sound system its definitely worth spending a couple of extra bucks on a thicker kit. On the bright side they do provide all the essentials for the hook up.
1,wooooow not!,this product is not what it says 8 ga. yea okay more like 12ga. so tiny lol.good thing I only bought for a real small 4 channel amp just to make my 4 6.5 door speakers sound better the amp calls for 8ga this wire looks perfect for terminals
